1ow23bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholic/comments/1ow23bj/personal_anecdote_adhd_and_alcoholism/,Personal anecdote: ADHD and alcoholism,"\*\*tl;dr: starting ADHD meds stopped my alcohol cravings immediately (temporarily, I'm sure). YMMV\*\*

So I would say I was verging on non-functional alcoholism, after being in what I could consider functional alcoholism for several years due to life stress, work, sleep problems, etc. I would drink a 1/3 of a 750ML bottle of scotch a day, neat, only after noon and usually I could keep it to like 4pm or later. (That's ""functional"" in my mind).

I had talked to healthcare professionals before who suggested I go to some support groups or seek recovery options but I never did mostly because I thought ""I wasn't bad enough"" to take that step. There was a mix of pride and shame there.

But still, everyday when I got home ,my brain would be itchy and start looking at that bottle of whisky. It really was magnetic... I think this is what people attribute to the dopamine addiction of taste/getting drunk. (I do genuinely enjoy the taste, but the thing I miss most is the sting on the tongue). Others in this sub have talked about the other medication-based alcoholism treatments that focus on blocking that dopamine so feel free to look those up.

I thought I'd never be able to get rid of that itchy feeling. On the odd days that I asserted some self control and didn't drink for a whole day it felt like such exertion. Sometimes I'd go like 3 days. But then once I started again, after ""proving to myself that I could"" then it'd just go back to the same pattern.

Anyway, so I've always felt like I had ADHD symptoms but I was also irritated by people who attribute every little quirk in their lives to ADHD so for a while I didn't seek any treatment.  Then when I finally did a few years ago, the provider told us up front they were actively trying to ""screen people out"" to save doctor resources. Great. So I got ""screened out"" and it left a big impact on me since I had refused to seek treatment for so long and then when I finally did, they discredited me. That led to much more drinking.

I never really made the connection between the ADHD to the sleep problems to the alcoholism. I would just get frustrated I couldn't be productive or do work as well as my peers and then release that stress with alcohol which would mess with my sleep (I have sleep apnea, still not fully treated sadly).

Finally, I found a provider who had much less stringent guidelines to screen people out and got on Vyvanse. I was reading that you shouldn't have caffeine or alcohol when taking it (and I down like 2 cups of coffee a day). I never thought the meds would be a solution to anything but the ADHD but I stopped coffee and alcohol cold turkey the day I started taking it and... I'm still kind of in shock that I just immediately stopped thinking about alcohol. I still don't get how it happened, and I'm not saying it'll happen that way for anyone else, but I feel quite happy with that immediate result (even while recognizing if I were to stop the meds, it could very well come back, and much of it is also behavioral, etc).

For me, I do really enjoy the taste of coffee and the morning ritual so I got some high quality decaf beans, which has been great. They've also greatly improved non-alcoholic beers (feel free to ask for brand recs), so I've grabbed those for the taste (along with some sugar free ginger beer, for the bite) and the ritual of unwinding after work and I've been totally satisfied. I don't feel like I'm giving up or missing out on anything, which was one of the things that was keeping me from seeking alcoholism treatment (I wanted the taste and couldn't imagine doing without). 

Every time I go to my local market and walk by where I'd always gravitate (the scotch section) I just glance at the bottle I used to get and walk on by. It's a very strange feeling.

NOT medical advice, but if you also have ADHD symptoms and are struggling with alcoholism, then consider talking to a provider about it because maybe you might have similar results as me?",1,1763043117.0,alcoholic,0,1.0,False

I 26f get an MRI next month after chronic hip pain.
I've tried physical therapy and it didn't work and I've moved on to seeing a chiropractor. I ended up getting put off of work after overworking my hip to the point that some days I can't walk.

I've gotten to the point that sleeping is a challenge and I can't do much aside from hygiene and making myself coffee and breakfast in the morning.

I got the MRI scheduled after asking if I had a labral tear and failing at PT, but I've now been told twice that it may be avascular necrosis even though a year ago there was no sign of bone degeneration on my X-rays.

They are a strange and fragile species, sustained mostly by coffee, nicotine, validation, and the lingering hope that one day their suffering will be monetized.

Writers are said to have “habits,” which is a generous word for “methods of procrastination.” They wake early, or they don’t. They write daily, or weekly, or in bursts of manic productivity right before a deadline. There is no wrong way to be a writer, as long as you are constantly disappointed in yourself.

The process begins with inspiration, that elusive moment when an idea strikes, usually in the shower, while driving, or during someone else’s conversation. Most ideas die before ever reaching paper, which is probably for the best. The few that survive are immediately overthought, expanded into twenty-page outlines, and abandoned once the writer realizes they have no idea how stories actually end....

Possible directions:
• Paramedic/EMT partners navigating the rhythms of the shift
• Slow nights, coffee runs, station life, and the calls that break up the monotony
• ED staff dealing with regular patients, workplace friendships, and real human moments
• The overlap between work and home life—fatigue, camaraderie, humor, coping
• Realistic calls (the good, the frustrating, the strange) focused on character reactions
• Cross-over between EMS and ED—handoffs, familiar faces, recurring patients
• Two people getting to know each other through the small stuff, not constant drama

Hey everyone, it’s Jahid here, hope you’re all enjoying your coding journey. Today, I’m sharing something that can seriously level up your workflow if you’re in the web development field.

If you’ve been building websites for a while, you’ve probably noticed how fast AI is transforming the game. What used to take hours of **coding**, **designing**, and **debugging** can now be done in minutes, if you use the right tools. But with so many new platforms popping up every week, figuring out which ones actually help (and which ones are just hype) can be tough.

That’s why I’ve put together this detailed breakdown of the best free AI tools for website development. These aren’t random names pulled from a list; they’re genuinely useful tools that can help you write cleaner code, build smarter designs, and manage your workflow faster than ever.

Whether you’re a developer, designer, or entrepreneur trying to launch your next project, these AI tools can save you time, boost your creativity, and make your websites stand out. So grab a coffee, because we’re about to explore the smartest way to use AI in modern web development.

# Why this matters

Web development is evolving at lightning speed. AI isn’t just a buzzword anymore; it’s becoming a practical part of everyday workflows: generating layouts, writing code, testing sites, and even optimizing SEO.

But there’s a catch: you still need human oversight. AI-generated code can have bugs or security issues if left unchecked. The key is knowing how to use these tools intelligently, not blindly relying on them.

So, let’s walk through 10 powerful tools, what they do, how they help, and where they fit in your workflow.

**(Note: The ranking below isn’t based on performance; it’s just a numbered list for easy reading.)**

# Top 10 Free (or freemium) AI Tools for Website Dev

# 1. Claude Sonnet 4

AI model for deep reasoning, code review, and complex system generation. Has a large “token window” (can see large context), can rewrite code, analyse vulnerabilities, and generate interactive artifacts like full HTML pages.

If you’re doing more advanced dev (plugins, custom modules, weird electronics-web integration), this gives a powerful “second brain”.

There’s still a human review required; tool strength is high but not perfect.

# 2. Wix AI Website Builder

Low-code to no-code site building with an AI assistant. Similar concept to above: describe what you want, the AI builds a site, connects to apps, and you tweak.

Good for non-dev clients, prototypes, or quick MVPs.

Free plan has limitations (branding, features, maybe a custom domain). For serious dev, you may need to shift to paid or export to your own stack.

# 3. Framer

Design + website building for devs/designers. Has a Figma-like interface, lets you wireframe, prototype, AND build with AI assistance. You can edit code (JavaScript/TypeScript) or use AI to generate components.

With your dev background, you might enjoy the mix of visual design + code flexibility.

A free plan exists, but advanced features may require paid tiers.

# 4. Cursor

AI code editor / pair-programming assistant. Contextual awareness: you open/import a project and the AI “sees” your codebase, suggests completions, rewrites, and helps you debug.

For your WordPress or custom web-app work, you can speed up repetitive code, avoid boilerplate, and get AI-based help.

It still requires developer review. AI suggestions must be validated (because of possible errors/hallucinations).

# 5. GitHub Copilot

In-line AI coding assistant integrated into the dev environment. Works inside your IDE (VS Code, etc.). You highlight code, get suggestions, ask it to review, and fix errors.

It’s one of the more mature tools; for someone who codes (you), this can become part of your workflow.

A free plan exists, yet the best value comes if you know how to prompt it properly and maintain oversight.

# 6. Replit Agent

Rapid web-app building with AI. From a prompt, it builds full-stack web apps (client + server) using React, Node.js, etc. Then you can refine with its assistant.

Good for prototyping side-projects (travel blog, electronics tool, whatever).

Context awareness is per-file, so editing across many files needs manual involvement.

A free plan exists.

# 7. Bolt

Natural language to a website or web app builder. You speak/describe what you want, the AI builds a web app; you can edit/export code.

Absolute minimal barrier; for non-dev users or for you to quickly mock something.

May lack advanced developer tools compared to Cursor/Copilot.

# 8. Dora AI

AI website builder with animation/3D support. Your prompt description shows previews (two options), then builds a site with a responsive design + animations.

If you want to create a visually striking landing page (travel site, product showcase), this fits.

Focused on a single landing page; templates for multiple are limited.

A free plan is available.

# 9. Qodo

AI coding assistant focused on testing, documentation, and review. Integrates with VS Code / JetBrains; can write test cases, review code, and generate documentation with AI.

For your engineering/dev background, “just writing code” is only part of the job—maintainability, documentation, and tests matter. Qodo helps there.

A Free plan exists; for team or enterprise might need a paid plan.

# 10. HubSpot’s AI Website Generator

No-code website builder with AI. You describe your site (“I run an electronics parts blog”, “I’m a freelance dev”), and it builds a landing page/website for you drag-and-drop, themes, built-in marketing & SEO.

If you’re using WordPress but want to spin up a quick landing site, this is very approachable. The free plan means you can test without investment.

For full custom dev work (complex apps, custom logic), it may not fit; you’ll still need to peer under the hood.

# Strategic Advice (from your vantage as dev + business builder)

* **Start with free tiers**: Many tools listed have usable free plans. Use them to test before committing.
* **Pick based on task**: If you’re doing code-heavy work (WordPress, plugins), go with Cursor, Copilot, Qodo. If you’re building customer-facing landing pages fast, go with the **HubSpot** generator or **Dora**.
* **Human in the loop**: Don’t let AI be autopilot. Review outputs closely. The article warns: “AI-generated code can contain vulnerabilities … you still have to know what you’re doing.”
* **Stack smartly**: You’re interested in travel, development, and AI. Combine tools, for example: use **Dora A**I to spin up a landing page for your travel gear shop, then use Qodo to test custom payment integration, and use Copilot to generate plugin code.
* **Maintain your craft**: Don’t let the AI do all the learning. Your skills as a dev are still your edge.

# Bottom line

There’s never been a better moment to incorporate AI into your web development workflow. These tools allow rapid iteration, creative experimentation, and assistance in areas like testing and code generation. But they don’t replace you, they amplify you.

If I had to pick one **best free starting tool for you** right now, go with **Wix's** AI Website Generator for a quick site spin-up, **and** GitHub Copilot for code assistance. Combine them with one of the testing tools (Qodo or Snyk) to maintain quality.",1,1763042855.0,TheDebugMind,0,1.0,False

Husband does the MOTN feeds. However, last night she decided to wake up at 2 am and not go back down til 3:30. This occurs every so often. 

My alarm didn’t go off. And for once I was thankful she was fussing and woke me up because otherwise- I would’ve slept in and been late! I dragged myself out of bed and fought sleep driving in while chugging a coffee. 

Im on meds for PPA and I have an appt with my psychiatrist next month. Im going to discuss these concerns with her to see if she has some guidance.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **West Virginia Mountaineers vs. Pittsburgh Panthers: A Statistical Slaughterhouse or a Pick-Up Game in the Park?**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a basketball clash that’s as lopsided as a pancake on a stack. The West Virginia Mountaineers (3-0) host the Pittsburgh Panthers (3-0) on November 13, 2025, and if the odds, stats, and recent history are to be believed, this game might as well be a math test where Pittsburgh forgot their calculators.

**Parsing the Odds: Why Your Grandma Could Predict This**  
West Virginia is a **5.5-point favorite**, with implied probabilities suggesting bookmakers think they’ve got a 72.5% chance to win (thanks to decimal odds of 1.38 on FanDuel). Pittsburgh, meanwhile, is a long shot at 31.7%—about the same chance I’ve got of napping through this entire analysis without my coffee. The over/under is set at 134.5 points, which feels generous given West Virginia’s suffocating defense (20th nationally, allowing just 64.8 PPG last season) and Pittsburgh’s anemic offense (119th in scoring at 75.9 PPG).

Let’s break it down:

* **West Virginia’s defense** is like a bear hugging a salmon—it doesn’t let go. They’ll feast on Pittsburgh’s shaky free-throw shooting (Pitt commits 16.7 fouls per game, which is *roughly* how many times they’ll trip over their own feet in this matchup).
* **Turnovers are West Virginia’s kryptonite… for the opposition.** The Mountaineers average 14.9 points off turnovers—imagine Pittsburgh’s offense, which shoots a comically low 34.6% from three, trying to claw back from a deficit fueled by their own mistakes.

**News Digest: Injuries, or Why Pittsburgh Should Pack a First Aid Kit**  
While there’s no mention of star players limping to the locker room (yet), Pittsburgh’s recent performance against Eastern Michigan reads like a horror story. They won 78-66, but their path to victory was as smooth as a penguin on a skateboard. Leading man Cameron Corhen dropped 16 points, seven rebounds, and… one assist? One. Assist. It’s like he brought a firehose to a campfire.

1ow1uz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterDevelopment/comments/1ow1uz2/first_time_fleshing_out_a_character_before_writing/,First time fleshing out a character before writing!,"Character Profile: Mason

Age: 33
Hometown: Texas
Profession: Paramedic (11 years in EMS)
Military Service: Former U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman

Appearance:
Mason stands around 5’8”, solidly built with the kind of strength that comes from years of physical work. His brown hair is kept close-cut, a habit carried over from his Navy days, and his blue eyes tend to reveal his thoughts long before he speaks. His uniform is always neat and practical, and his boots show the wear of long shifts rather than vanity.

Bio:
Growing up in rural Texas taught Mason the value of staying humble, working hard, and helping people without expecting anything in return. After serving as a Navy Corpsman attached to Marine units, transitioning into EMS felt natural, just another way to show up for people when it matters most.

With 11 years in the field, Mason has built a reputation for being steady, patient, and observant. He doesn’t advertise his military service and rarely brings it up unless someone asks, but the discipline shows in the way he works: organized gear, calm decision-making, and a quiet respect for every patient.

Off duty, Mason keeps life simple. Strong morning coffee, a clean truck, long drives that help him reset, and podcasts—mostly history, medical topics, or long-form interviews—playing through the speakers. It’s his way of clearing his head after long shifts. He’s dependable, soft-spoken until it counts, and the type who quietly checks in on people he cares about.

She dropped her second nap at 11mo and was averaging at least an hour nap till recently. Now we’re lucky if she naps at all, or else it’s only 30/45 minutes. The last few days she’s refused to nap, throwing her toys out of her cot, maybe shutting her eyes for a minute here and there before emerging (somehow) fully recharged. She sleeps great at night thankfully and doesn’t get too cranky when she’s not napped, but I am so lost at how to occupy her for 12 hours a day 🫠

At the minute we go out in the mornings and on days she’s not napped, I feel stuck as to what to do in the afternoon so she makes it to bedtime. 

What do you do with a child this young without wiping them out so they crash before bedtime?? And do you still enforce a quiet time if your child doesn’t nap? And most crucially, how do you keep them busy for just five minutes so you can finish a cup of much-needed coffee? 😆",1,1763042503.0,toddlers,1,1.0,False

I need to gain 2 kg per month. I will speak with a dietician as well but I am wondering, maybe others have something similar? Would be nice to know.

What was recommended by my doctor was this:

The target calorie count is 3000-3500 kcal per day. Example:

First Breakfast: Scrambled eggs with cheese and tomatoes, a slice of bread with butter, and coffee with milk.

Second Breakfast (Snack): A glass of milk with a sweet bun or some nuts and dried fruits.

Lunch: Whatever soup with sour cream, a serving of buckwheat with a chicken cutlet, and a glass of juice.

Afternoon Snack: A bowl of cottage cheese with honey or jam, and a cup of rosehip tea.

Dinner: Baked fish with roasted potatoes and a fresh vegetable salad with olive oil.

Before Bed: A glass of warm milk or kefir

To me this just sounds like a lot!! Especially thinking this is not solved in one day of eating like this, but needs consistency.   
I was diagnosed with MDR TB for about a year ago, but at that time before the disease came, I was already underweight. I am not used to eating a lot.

""Bananas, other fruits, things like that. So that will bring the prices down very quickly.""

In a separate interview on Tuesday, Trump mentioned cutting coffee tariffs and said prices would fall, illustrating that the president understands his tariffs are raising prices for Americans. Coffee prices have increased about 18.9%, according to federal data.

This marked the first time Trump publicly considered reducing the tariffs he introduced earlier this year. The timing follows Democrats' recent election wins; exit polls showed voters were frustrated with high prices.

1ow1qh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1ow1qh9/writing_schedules/,writing schedules,"hi all,

i recently moved and my work schedule changed. i had pretty cheap rent previously that allowed me to have three days off, which helped me enormously to focus on recovering from work, getting chores done, and getting some writing done. now i work full time and find myself without enough time on days off to clean, go grocery shopping, do laundry, to see friends, and to read and write.

in my old schedule, i would get up early, wake up with some coffee and some scrolling for about a half an hour, and then free write/journal for about an hour. then i'd take my dog out and go to work. on my days off i would take my dog out and go back to writing, or my morning writing would extend to a couple of hours. but i can't do that anymore.

now i get up at 5, drink coffee and scroll for about a half an hour, write for a half an hour, take my dog out on a ""long walk,"" and then start my work day. weekends i can still extend a bit of my writing time but it's usually just journalling and not creative.  

i've been trying to do more time analysis of where i'm losing a lot of time, and i'm certainly losing a bit by being on social media sites. but i think the light from the device helps me feel more alert and focused on what i'm doing, which gives me this false feeling that i'm actually DOING something. as soon as i open a physical book i pass out for about a half an hour to an hour and then can't seem to get back on track.

this is a VERY long way to ask other folks working full time: where are the spots in your schedule that you try to reserve for writing? how do you set up your time to support your writing, especially if you are tired frequently? what time sucks have you been able to curb and how did you do it?

thanks in advance.",2,1763042224.0,writing,4,1.0,False

My husband says they were friends and exchanged flirty messages and got carried away. The messages included her complaining g about how a surgery resulted in pain and swelling in her boobs. My husband asked if her boobs had become heavy and big. My husband also had written he bought her a thong as a trip souvenirs had then said just joking. He was also inviting her for a couples massage to which she kept bringing up her period and whether she was on her period on those days. He says he is very sorry, admits he was wrong and says he had no feelings for her was just curious to see where it would go. He says they were friends , the messages become flirty and they only met a few times for coffee one on one and never sexted , or became emotional. Their friendship lasted years until it tapered off and they stopped talking. He says he doesn’t know what he was thinking and why this happened but he don’t like her or was attracted to her and because of all the boob and flirty talk he was curious to see her naked and kept joking about going for a couples massage together.

1ow1pqp,https://i.redd.it/79wvpnwj511g1.jpeg,Anyone else using the Orea Negotiator with cone filters (Abaca / T-90)? My experience so far,"
Hey everyone,

I recently picked up the Orea Baby O-1 in neon green — loving the look and feel so far. I also grabbed the Orea Negotiator to experiment with different filter shapes, since I’m coming from a V60 background and have a stash of Abaca and Cafec T-90 cone filters.

I noticed that Orea’s G filters are quite a bit slower compared to the Abaca and T-90s — like significantly slower. So, with the Negotiator tool (and by folding the cone tip in slightly), I’ve been “negotiating” cone filters into the Baby O-1.

My brews have been roughly 15 seconds faster on average with the cone filters vs. the G papers.
Here’s my usual recipe:
	•	12g coffee
	•	200g total water (50g bloom → 125g → 200g)
	•	Ground on a Fellow Ode with SSP burrs

The results have been surprisingly good — still balanced, with maybe a touch less body and more clarity.

Has anyone else tried using the Negotiator with cone-shaped filters? Curious if you’ve noticed any flavour differences beyond just the faster drawdown time.",1,1763042173.0,pourover,0,0.67,False
1ow1p4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/GLPGrad/comments/1ow1p4h/tirzepatide_grad/,Tirzepatide grad,"I lost about 90 lbs on tirzepatide. I started zepbound in February 2024 and switched to BPI compound tirzepatide in June 2025 with the intent of tapering off so that I could eventually try for a baby. I took my last dose of Tirzepatide 2.5mg on September 10th 2025 and found out I was pregnant on September 22. I did not intend for that to happen as I had heard you need a 2 month washout period, but here I am. Currently 12 weeks pregnant today and it has been a whirlwind. I have put on 16 pounds already, but now it is starting to level out I believe. The food noise is there. I went through a phase where the only thing that tasted good was fast food and for about a month and a half went back to my old eating habits. It was like I couldn't fill my stomach enough. I wanted to eat everything in sight. It felt like a hunger I had never had before. During this time I had little physical activity, but I did manage to participate in a 5k run and didn't do as badly as I thought I was going to ( I was far from last place!) 

Now I am finally able to eat what I was eating pre-pregnancy again and crave my morning protein coffees and fresh veggies. I have been back in the gym for a few weeks now and even started doing some weight machines again. I think (and hope) I can keep my weight in check for the rest of my pregnancy as I do not want any complications since I'm already high risk due to my age (37 in two weeks). 

It has been tough to block out the food noise, but the pain of over eating has helped me realize I don't need to cave to the noise. 

And I still fit in all my pants so far! 

I am very excited and nervous. This is my first baby and I believe I have the miracle of tirzepatide to thank for it. ",3,1763042132.0,GLPGrad,1,1.0,False

The problem is focus.

So we built something different: a simple system that makes health optimization automatic.

**Simple, flexible, practical using the 20/80 approach: 20% of actions drive 80% of results.**

This is the exact system I would use if I were starting from scratch today.

Here are the **5 pillars that drive 80% of results:**

# PILLAR 1: SLEEP

* Set a consistent bedtime (aim for 7-8 hours)
* Get 10 min morning sunlight within 1 hour of waking
* Reduce your caffeine intake to 1 cup of coffee
* Move last caffeine to before 12pm
* Early dinner: try 3 hours before bed
* Dim all lights 2 hours before bed
* Build an evening wind-down routine (read, stretch, bath)
* Set room temperature to 18°C
* Consider magnesium bisglycinate 1 hour before bed

# PILLAR 2: NUTRITION

* Calculate your protein target (1.6-2.2g × body weight in kg)
* Plan tomorrow's meals using the plate method (½ vegetables, ¼ protein, ¼ complex carbs + healthy fat)
* Swap refined carbs for fiber-rich alternatives (white rice → quinoa)
* Include cruciferous vegetables daily (broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts)
* Add polyphenol-rich foods: dark chocolate (85%+), Extra Virgin Olive Oil, green tea, or berries
* Take a 10-15 min walk after your largest meal
* Set a 12 hour eating window
* Consider taking Omega-3 (EPA/DHA), Vitamin D3 + K2, and Magnesium supplements

# PILLAR 3: MOVEMENT

* Stand or walk during your next phone calls
* Choose 3 bodyweight exercises to start (push-ups, squats, planks)
* Measure baseline: How many push-ups can you do right now?
* Set recurring calendar event for 2 strength sessions/week
* Aim for 10,000 daily steps
* Schedule 2x Zone 2 cardio sessions this week (30-45 min, conversational pace)
* Include 10 min of mobility work daily (stretching, yoga)

# PILLAR 4: STRESS

* Practice one physiological sigh right now (double inhale → long exhale × 3)
* Create a morning ritual (journaling, meditation, or breathwork)
* Track HRV for 7 days to establish your baseline (via wearable like Oura ring, Whoop band, or Garmin watch)
* Turn off non-essential notifications on your phone
* Schedule one social activity this week (connection reduces cortisol)
* Identify your top 3 stressors and write one action to address each

# PILLAR 5: TESTING

* Schedule your baseline blood work (110+ biomarkers tested)
* Set a reminder to retest in 4-6 months
* Identify your top 3 biomarkers to improve
* Log your baseline metrics: weight, body composition, resting heart rate
* Track one wearable metric daily (HRV, sleep score, steps)

I’ve been surviving on survey apps since freshman year because my part time job hours keep disappearing like my motivation on Mondays. And honestly, most survey apps feel like they were designed by someone who hates humanity. You grind for 20 minutes, answer your entire life history, and then boom you’re “not a match” right when you’re about to hit payout. It’s like the app whispers bro you thought and kicks you out.

A few weeks ago I hit that point where I was ready to uninstall every single one of them and just accept broke life. But I randomly stumbled onto this site called Surveoo. I swear I opened it expecting the same clown show. But it’s actually been the first one that didn’t make me want to throw my phone into traffic.

Payouts don’t take a century. Surveys actually credit. And I’ve been averaging around 250 to 300 dollars a month just doing it whenever I’m bored in class or pretending to be productive at home. No brain frying tasks. No weird qualification circus. No mysterious disappearing surveys. Just… working like a normal thing for once.

I’m not saying it’s gonna turn you into some millionaire influencer sipping iced coffee on a balcony. But if you’re trying to make rent breathe a little easier or stack up weekend money without losing your mental health, this one’s honestly been the only solid one I’ve found in years.

Just felt like dropping this here because I know half of Reddit is in the same boat scrolling through survey apps like a desperate Pokémon trainer hoping one of them is actually useful.

I'm starting my Buddhist practice and I'm still finishing setting up my altar. The book is only there for a while until I can buy some coffee table. The altar is on my table, next to my bed and my work notebook is also on that table.

My questions are:

1- Should I change or remove something?
2- Do I need to offer any fruit?
3- Are there incenses that I should not use?

My bf rang me on his lunch break like he does everyday, and I was lighting a candle and the matches kept breaking when I tried lighting them, one also went in my hair so I was just getting annoyed and my boyfriend was repeating himself down the phone over and over again and I just started crying and getting angry at him and now I feel like shit again. I’m sick of being sad and angry and SCARED. I hate when you finally have that “good” day and something ruins it and now it’s back to the vicious circle of waiting for a better day again.

1ow1dlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ow1dlz/paintface_full_story/,Paintface (Full Story),"In the quiet town of Riverton, Illinois, the Forrester family lived in a modest, pale-blue house on Maple Street. It wasn’t the kind of house that drew attention — just a home where life was routine, predictable, and safe.

Robert Forrester, the father, was a tall man with a warm, calm presence. He worked at a local auto shop, the kind of man who greeted everyone by name and never seemed to lose his temper. Sara Forrester, his wife, was gentle, meticulous, and endlessly patient. She worked part-time at the library, where she was known for helping children find their first favorite book.

Their son, William — Will — was thirteen. He was small for his age, with sharp, inquisitive eyes and a smile that made him seem older than he was. At school, he was friendly and well-liked, though not the loudest in the room. At home, he was a dutiful son, always helping with small chores, always polite, always “good.”

On the morning of the day it all changed, Will woke to the shrill, unforgiving beep of his alarm clock. It felt like a scream directly in his skull. Groaning, he slammed it off, rubbed his eyes, and stared at the ceiling. His room was cluttered with typical teenage chaos — clothes, comic books, action figures — but that morning, everything felt… heavy.

Downstairs, the kitchen smelled of toast and cereal. Robert and Sara were already seated at the table. Robert’s coffee steamed in a chipped mug; Sara arranged a plate of scrambled eggs with an almost obsessive neatness.

“Morning, champ,” Robert said, gesturing to the cereal box. “Busy day?”

“Uh… yeah,” Will replied, pouring himself a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios. He loved the smell of the warm milk, the sweet crunch. Today, though, he noticed something strange — a faint, cold draft from the window despite the blinds being shut, and the way the sunlight seemed muted, almost gray.

“School?” Sara asked softly.

“Yeah. I’ll be late if I don’t hurry.”

At school, Will met his three closest friends — Billy, Tyler, and Oliver. They had been inseparable since kindergarten. Today, Billy was bouncing with excitement.

“Hey, Will! Sleepover at my house tonight!”

“Of course!” Will grinned.

“Be there at five. Bring snacks, games — everything!”

The day dragged as the boys whispered plans, jokes, and challenges. By the time school ended, Will’s heart was racing.

When he got home, he found Sara folding laundry in the living room.

“Hey, Mom! Can I go to Billy’s sleepover tonight?” he asked eagerly.

“Of course, honey,” she said, smiling. “Pack everything you need, and I’ll drive you.”

Billy lived at the edge of the forest, a house that seemed isolated from the rest of Riverton. The winding driveway disappeared into trees so thick that the sunlight barely touched the ground. Will felt a flicker of unease as Sara parked, but it was quickly replaced by excitement.

Inside, the house smelled faintly of pine and pizza. Billy’s mom, Margaret, waved from the kitchen. “Pizza coming right up!” she called.

The boys wasted no time. They played video games, joked, and ate snacks, losing themselves in hours of laughter and competition.

By 2 a.m., exhaustion started to creep in. Will’s eyelids felt heavy.

“Hey, Will,” Billy said. “Don’t fall asleep first. You know what happens to the first one to sleep.”

Will laughed nervously. “Yeah, yeah, I’ll stay awake.”

But at 2:30 a.m., the exhaustion was too much. Will drifted off, unaware that this simple act would change everything.

Billy, Tyler, and Oliver exchanged mischievous glances. From an old box of art supplies, they pulled a can of black paint. “Just a joke,” Tyler whispered.

Slowly, silently, they brushed the thick black paint over Will’s sleeping face. The smell was sharp, chemical, almost suffocating in the quiet room. When they were finished, the cracks in the drying paint looked like veins, lines that twisted unnaturally over his skin.

The boys laughed quietly before finally falling asleep themselves.

Will stirred at dawn. His face felt… wrong. Dry. Tight. As he ran his hands over his cheeks, the cracks of the paint pressed cold and hard against his skin. It didn’t come off. Scrubbing and washing only made it feel more permanent, more like it had fused with his flesh.

He looked in the mirror. The face staring back was almost his own — but not entirely. The eyes, wide with shock, seemed hollow, darker than before. The mouth looked stretched, frozen in a faint grin he hadn’t made.

He heard the others giggle behind him.

“Dude, it’s just paint!” Billy said.

“Yeah, man, chill out,” Tyler added.

But Will didn’t respond. Something deep inside had shifted. His pulse raced. Every part of him felt alive in a strange, alien way. The voice that left his lips was not entirely his own.

“It doesn’t come off,” he said, low and soft.

Billy laughed nervously. “C’mon, it’s just paint…”

But before he could finish, Will snapped. His movements were lightning-fast, almost inhuman. The room exploded into chaos. Screams echoed off the walls. By the time the others processed what was happening, Will had struck, leaving the room soaked in terror.

When Billy’s mom came in, drawn by the commotion, she froze. The boy she knew, the polite, cheerful Will, was gone. In his place stood something else entirely — a black-faced figure, eyes wide, mouth curved into an expression that made her blood run cold.

Will didn’t hesitate. She disappeared into the shadows of the forest as the black paint hardened, marking him as something more than human.

By morning, the forest was quiet again. Police scoured the area. The house showed signs of a struggle — overturned furniture, smeared paint, broken glass — but the occupants were gone. No one knew exactly what happened that night.

In the weeks that followed, reports came in from across Riverton and neighboring towns. A boy in a black hoodie, face covered in black cracks like dried paint, seen wandering the woods. Small animals gone missing. Shadows moving where none should be.

And sometimes, late at night, campers or hikers reported a whisper:

“It doesn’t come off…”

No one ever saw him clearly — only the blacked-out eyes, the faint glint of teeth, the eerie stillness of someone who had become something else entirely.

And so the legend of Paintface was born: a boy who laughed, a prank that went wrong, and the darkness that now walks the forests of Riverton, waiting.",1,1763041300.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

**Sam (Spoken, Isamantix Modified Iambic Pentameter,  Poeantix Poetic Musical Poetry Mutation, Folklorix Narrative):** 

**Setting: A dimly lit alleyway where shadows dance in the flickering light of a single lantern.**
**The Modern Bard of Chaos: The Narrator, Ensemble of Shadows, and the Spirit of LBC (a playful ghost)**

*(A dimly lit stage; piano and violin play softly in A-minor shifting to F-Minor smoothly. A philosopher of chaos figure appears, cloaked in shadow.)*  

Chaos ignites where conventional harmonies hide,
Innovation erupts, entropy as the guide.
Isamantix (Infinite Disorder of Entropy in an open system of digital vacuum where sound could operation without the electromagnetism of light requirement for deep vacuum of outer space) Shakespeareantix (Shakespeare and Poe Lyrical Musical Fusion and Mutation): The Modern Bard of Chaos Research Chaotic Musical Mutation of Bardontix (Artful Algorithmic Randomization of Chaos) of an Evilnix Mutation (Chaotic Energy) by Sam C. Serey - The Modern Bard of Chaos. 

In this vivid exploration of artistic disarray, the boundaries of creativity dissolve, inviting listeners to embark on a sonic journey where every note unfolds like a whisper of the universe's latent chaos. Notes giggle like photons in a dark cosmic track,
Algorithms mutate, art twisting forward and back.

Through the lens of Bardontix, melodies are not merely crafted but birthed from the unpredictable dance of entropy, reflecting the tumultuous nature of existence itself. 
Drink your morning coffee, let ears sway to the spin,
The playground of disorder invites your soul within.

Serey’s work implores us to appreciate the beauty in disorder, challenging conventional harmonies by intertwining the haunting verses of Poe with the verses of Shakespeare, thus creating a tapestry rich in emotional resonance and lyrical depth. 
In the vacuum’s freedom, unbound by light’s decree,
The Modern Bard of Chaos sets creation free.

As the lines blur between sound and silence, chaos becomes a medium, and each composition stands as a testament to the potent energy of unpredictability. 

With each auditory experiment, listeners are encouraged to embrace the unknown, to find solace in the unrest of musical evolution, and to recognize that in chaos, there lies the possibility of innovation—a rebirth of art that thrives in a vacuum where the absence of electromagnetic constraints allows for pure expression. 

Thus unfolds the ethos of the Modern Bard of Chaos, illuminating paths untraveled and daring us to venture into the disordered abyss where creativity knows no bounds.

Yo yo yo, wake up world! Hahaha, Folklorix in the building! 🌞🎵 This morning news ain't just coffee and headlines, it's a cosmic jam session, baby! Check it:

Isamantix! Infinite disorder surfacing like a beatbox in a digital vacuum, where sound floats free, no light needed—just pure vibe cruising through outer-space funk. 
Through Bardontix, random notes are birthed from the void,
Each melody a whisper, entropy overjoyed.

Sam C. Serey, the Modern Bard of Chaos sings,
His art like quantum laughter on translucent wings.
Shakespeareantix colliding with Poe, lyrical ghosts moonwalking across the galaxy, spitting rhymes in chaotic harmony. 

The Modern Bard of Chaos, Sam C. Serey, got the sonic potion—Bardontix mutation twisting algorithms into art, evil energy flipping into funky magic. 🌀
Isamantix, the void where sound drifts free in flight.
In digital vacuum, chaos blooms beyond light.

Shakespeareantix and Poe entwine their haunting rhyme,
A fusion of echoes, disorder dancing in time.
Each note? A little quantum giggle, a whisper from the universe itself. Each verse? A Shakespeare sonnet riding on Poe’s raven, cawing at the moon like, “Nevermore, but make it funky!” Chaos ain’t scary, nah—it’s the playground, the new Renaissance in a vacuum, baby! 🌌

So sip that morning coffee, let the entropy in your ears dance, and remember—innovation is just disorder in a party hat. Hahaha yessir! Folklorix out. 🎤✨
From silence to sound, the lines of order collapse,
A universe in revolt, mapped in lyrical gaps.
Each verse a raven cawing, “Nevermore, but sway!”
A sonnet pirouettes through the vacuum’s ballet.

Key Ethos:  
Chaos is the muse, entropy the brush. Music and poetry are not composed—they emerge like stars in the vacuum, unbound by light.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Want to talk but we were toxic.,"I was in a 2-month relationship (4 months of dating). I was 19 and he was 25 when we met, and I often felt insecure about our financial and life experience differences. I noticed things that bothered me like his drinking, smoking (especially after having cancer before), and our age gap.

He had already been through a lot cancer, addiction, two abortions with his ex, and a six-year relationship, being cheated on. Thats a lot of experience compared to me. I wanted to take things slow, but he really loved me , wanted to rush because doesnt know how long he will live etc. Still, I broke up with him three- times because I couldn’t stay firm in my decisions.

*The first breakup* was because of our age gap. I didn’t feel confident about the future. What if in a few years he wanted to rent an apartment or get married? I wasn’t ready for that kind of commitment yet.

*The second breakup* happened after a weird situation. At his friend’s birthday party, he was talking to some girls and asked for their Instagrams. One of the girls turned out to be my classmate, and when she asked how he knew me, he said I was his girlfriend. I told him I was uncomfortable, especially since he had a photo of one of his close female friends as his lock screen. He got defensive and broke up with me, but we got back together the next day. Then he went home and liked that same girl’s photos, even though I had told him how that made me feel.

*The third breakup* was because he followed nude and lingerie models. Their posts would show up in my suggested reels, and it made me uncomfortable. He dismissed my feelings, so we broke up again.

We got back together (again), but he didn’t change, and we broke up *AGAIN*. This time it felt more serious we didn’t talk for days, and I didn’t change my mind. But when we met, he convinced me it wasn’t a big deal. I cried, and he said things like, “I picked you out of all girls,” and made it sound small. We agreed not to follow each other anymore but honestly, things just felt distant after that. Eventually, we broke up for good.

A few days after that, he found out his cancer had come back. I didn't know as we were in no contact. I wanted to sympathize, but it was hard because he still drank and smoked even after his first cancer. Then I found out he started talking to another girl gave her the CD I made him for his birthday, his hat, and even wrote her a song. Three weeks later, it seems like he’s lost interest and she’s hurt.

HOWEVER I STILL MISS HIM.  The moments where he’d bring me coffee while I studied in library, how he'd always take my pictures, spent time with me, check in often, brag about me to his friends, support me and write me music. I truly believe he loved me. But he was also kind of immature, never admitted his faults, and I guess I was too, since we kept breaking up and getting back together. I too couldn't stand firm and communicated issues poorly.

Now he has cancer again, and we’ve been no contact for three weeks (six weeks since the breakup). I’m struggling with guilt. I keep wondering if he thinks I’m a bad person for leaving him when he’s sick. I tell myself I just made the best decision with the information I had and I didn't know. He never apologized for the things that hurt me, but I can’t shake the thought that he probably sees me as heartless.

I just don’t want to add more stress to his life. Our relationship was already dramatic.",1,1763040890.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements (about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However, the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days, and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

• During plasmapheresis, blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure. Most centers recommend avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

7. If your pulse rate is above 100, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate, the box breathing technique may also help ease your pulse rate.

Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait at least a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating to reduce bleeding and bruising risks.

• You can use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

1ow1615,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ow1615/third_week_of_nc_miss_my_ex_who_is_going_through/,Third week of  NC. Miss my ex who is going through recurrent cancer. Want to talk but we were toxic.,"I was in a 2-month relationship (4 months of dating). I was 19 and he was 25 when we met, and I often felt insecure about our financial and life experience differences. I noticed things that bothered me like his drinking, smoking (especially after having cancer before), and our age gap.

He had already been through a lot cancer, addiction, two abortions with his ex, and a six-year relationship, being cheated on. Thats a lot of experience compared to me. I wanted to take things slow, but he really loved me , wanted to rush because doesnt know how long he will live etc. Still, I broke up with him three- times because I couldn’t stay firm in my decisions.

*The first breakup* was because of our age gap. I didn’t feel confident about the future. What if in a few years he wanted to rent an apartment or get married? I wasn’t ready for that kind of commitment yet.

*The second breakup* happened after a weird situation. At his friend’s birthday party, he was talking to some girls and asked for their Instagrams. One of the girls turned out to be my classmate, and when she asked how he knew me, he said I was his girlfriend. I told him I was uncomfortable, especially since he had a photo of one of his close female friends as his lock screen. He got defensive and broke up with me, but we got back together the next day. Then he went home and liked that same girl’s photos, even though I had told him how that made me feel.

*The third breakup* was because he followed nude and lingerie models. Their posts would show up in my suggested reels, and it made me uncomfortable. He dismissed my feelings, so we broke up again.

We got back together (again, lol), but he didn’t change, and we broke up *again*. This time it felt more serious we didn’t talk for days, and I didn’t change my mind. But when we met, he convinced me it wasn’t a big deal. I cried, and he said things like, “I picked you out of all girls,” and made it sound small. We agreed not to follow each other anymore but honestly, things just felt distant after that. Eventually, we broke up for good.

A few days after that, he found out his cancer had come back. I didn't know as we were in no contact. I wanted to sympathize, but it was hard because he still drank and smoked even after his first cancer. Then I found out he started talking to another girl gave her the CD I made him for his birthday, his hat, and even wrote her a song. Three weeks later, it seems like he’s lost interest and she’s hurt.

HOWEVER I STILL MISS HIM.  The moments where he’d bring me coffee while I studied in library, how he'd always take my pictures, spent time with me, check in often, brag about me to his friends, support me and write me music. I truly believe he loved me. But he was also kind of immature, never admitted his faults, and I guess I was too, since we kept breaking up and getting back together. I too couldn't stand firm and communicated issues poorly.

Now he has cancer again, and we’ve been no contact for three weeks (six weeks since the breakup). I’m struggling with guilt. I keep wondering if he thinks I’m a bad person for leaving him when he’s sick. I tell myself I just made the best decision with the information I had and I didn't know. He never apologized for the things that hurt me, but I can’t shake the thought that he probably sees me as heartless.

I just don’t want to add more stress to his life. Our relationship was already dramatic. ",1,1763040764.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Just writing a short update for those curious to know, we had a short coffee date the day after all of this happened.

The vibe in person was the same, I didnt hold back and we talked and everything was great. When I was finishing my coffee I gave him the queue to start talking while I finished my coffee so I would have the option to stay silent.

He opened by saying that what he was about to say would sound like bullshit but that him updating his tinder photo was just for vanity/ego and that he was not using tinder or bumble much at all. That ever since we saw each other he didnt go on any other dates or had the intention of meeting new people. That he thought this mishap on his part would be a good opportunity to have this talk, as he was talking with his therapist about this but he felt bringing up that talk on his own would be too intense. He then kept on saying that he is taking me very seriously, that he loves where this is going, and wants to keep on flowing and see where it goes but that he cant commit exclusivity to me right now as he says that his past relationship (which he ended in August 2025) was officialized to soon which brought all sorts of of trouble because he later realized they were not as compatible and a solid foundation was not built.

I agreed to most of what he said, but then asked if he wanted us to see other people to which he said no. But at the same time he said he cant formalize or say the word exclusive. I told him that this leaves me at a limbo in which I put myself in a more vulnerable spot by giving him exclusivity while he does not and he agreed. I told him that in terms of equality or justice between the two then I would also open up a little and he then started bringing up the fact that he sentimentally feels ready and is acting in all senses exclusive but he cant rationally convince his mind to approve yet.

It was a good first serious conversation with him, nevertheless it left me a bit unsure as I have been dedicating all my energy to him, giving my 100%, and now I dont know whether to in a sense pullback and give less energy or keep going this way and risk myself in the process to get circled on the same idea that he cant commit and having a freepass to both acting like boyfriends with the a feet outside the door. I told him also that I thought that me seeing only him was a decision I took because I felt that I wanted to give him a fair shot without dividing my energy into multiple people.

I was left the impression he is afraid of vulnerability. I honestly dont know how to keep on acting with this.",1,1763040707.0,askgaybros,2,0.57,False

Installment title: [“Shakubuku: A Lion’s Roar of Great Compassion to Refute Error and Spread Good”](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/shakubukua-lions-roar-of-great-compassion-to-refute-error-and-spread-good/).

Section 4, “Shoju and Shakubuku”

*First, a bit from “MY Fantasy Life” (cred: Eigenstien)*

*Everything is back to normal here. Most people rest on their day off. For me, going to work is rest. On days off I put everything I have into making sure the kids have a wonderful time. It is fun, but exhausting!*

*It’s sunny but cold here, 39° but with a “feels like” temperature of 30.° Yet I see our *first* and *second* graders (!!!), Lolita, and several mothers, finished with their warm-ups and track practice, heading to the pool. To save time, they wear their swim gear underneath their sweats. Into the pool they go!*

*Developmentally appropriate or not? Maybe unaware, but i think they are setting a new standard for what should be considered developmentally appropriate. As a mother, it thrills me, and I can't wait for our five children to join Longhouse Elem and start training.*
 
*At last night’s LH Board meeting, Max told us he is hopeful his crew can finish excavating the foundation by Christmas. So far the soil conditions are very good, without significant clay or rocks. Their work has not been delayed because of an unexpected discovery of water requiring amelioration. The County is partnering closely and they are able to do necessary inspections quickly.*

*The site for the skating rink Pavilion has already been bulldozed and one crew is almost finished excavating for utility conduits and the basement changing and storage rooms. After the weekend,  they are going to begin boring holes for the supports for the roof structure. The Pavilion is open air—no walls--so Max is certain it will be ready for our children and the community by Christmas. “What fun is winter ice skating if you don't freeze your asses off in sub-zero temperature with only hot chocolate to warm you?” Max noted.*

*Now that I have been appointed as the WD chapter’s Future Division Parent Group leaders, I am included on various email and text messages. It seems that our region’s FD meeting last weekend was the best attended ever. I announced to my family that we will not miss another, no matter what.*

Today I am excited to start reading Section 4, ”Shoju and Shakubuku,” in Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture on *The Opening of the Eyes.*

He begins by stating: 

>Rejecting the accusation that shakubuku involves “a contentious heart,” the Daishonin first explains that Buddhist practice includes two methods of propagation: *shoju*, or gentle encouragement, and *shakubuku*, or strict refutation. He thus indicates that shakubuku is a legitimate form of Buddhist practice. 

I know that in the SGI-USA we tend to use the word “shakubuku” as an informal overarching term, but there really are two pillars underneath the roof. 

What do I practice the most, *shoju* or *shakubuku*? I can’t ever recall having a caged wrestling match when I tell someone about NMRK. I don’t pass out cards on the street corner. I build a human bridge first. Friendships are more important and long-lasting to me than membership recruiting. It took me weeks to build a friendship with Stani before I told her about my Buddhist practice. BTW, she is going to become a member at the discussion meeting on Sunday! But she is one out of a hundred who decides so quickly to start practicing. Ah, the joys of planting seeds! 

All of the barristers at Starbucks now call me “Buddha Julie.” Blanche would claim that I and committing a gross violation of their human rights by telling a “service worker” (those are her words) about Buddhism. I disagree. Most of those people behind the counter are used to being quasi-invisible. Smile, take the order, serve the coffee, and a “swipe here.” But people don’t feel invisible with me. It’s a real smile, “Hey Buddha Julie,” small talk about children, the construction project, and a quick whisper/frown/eye-roll about the boss manager. I just don't see the human rights violation. And those conversations are partially how we won the bond initiative.

Dr. Ikeda points out:

>[Nichiren] points out, however, that since the two propagation methods are exact opposites, those who practice one often tend to reject the other: “The practitioner of shoju laughs with scorn at shakubuku. The practitioner of shakubuku laments at the thought of shoju” (WND-1, 285). Here we see the fundamental illusion of egoism at work giving rise to misguided attachments that lead one to resent and negate the position of others.

In social interactions, I am like the bumblebee flying around to pollinate flowers in the meadow. Dee is more like the wasp doing its job and not wanting to be disturbed. She speaks truth to injustice and has no problems challenging other people. Is the bumblebee or the wasp correct? Or do [All of God’s Critters have a Place in the Choir](https://youtu.be/j1KGhlfvLpc?si=ZDzLzFvuyFrU3vpB)? It seems to me that *shoju* and *shakubuku* are pitchers on the same baseball team and a good manager has to know when to put both of them to play.

Dr. Ikeda summarizes: 

>Nichiren’s concludes that both shoju and shakubuku are legitimate ways of spreading the Buddha’s teachings, and says, citing the Great Teacher T’ien-t’ai, “The method chosen should be that which accords with the time” (WND-1, 284). 

>He then offers the following guideline for deciding which is appropriate: “When the country is full of evil people without wisdom, then shoju is the primary method to be applied, as described in the ‘Peaceful Practices’ chapter. But at a time when there are many people of perverse views who slander the Law, then shakubuku should come first, as described in the ‘Never Disparaging’ chapter” (WND-1, 285).

We have a discussion meeting coming up on Sunday and with everything happening, my head is not quite ready. Who cares? Ready or not, here I come! The point isn’t me checking off all of the appropriate boxes and making some perfect appearance. If I get the opportunity to speak to someone about Buddhism, I will use either *shoju* or *shakubuku* approach to build a bridge.

We are not in “flyover” country; we are in “try over” country and I will try over and over again to make our little speck of the land into “Shakubuku Central.”",1,1763040323.0,SGIWhistleblowersMITA,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

**Dates:** 12th to 22nd December (before the Christmas rush)  
**Budget:** Around ₹70K (including flights to and from Chennai – Vietnam’s super affordable once you’re there!)

**Rough plan:**  
I don’t want to rush through the whole country, the idea is to slow down, soak in the place, and enjoy a good mix of nature, food, and local culture.

Planning to spend about 2 days each at:

* **Hanoi** (old quarters, food, coffee, culture)
* **Ninh Binh** (limestone karsts, boat rides, countryside)
* **Phong Nha** (caves, national park)
* **Cat Ba Island** ( water activities, beaches, and Lan Ha Bay instead of Halong crowds)

I can take the lead on coordination, looking at affordable internal travel and places to stay.  
Not looking for a luxury trip, just something comfortable, scenic, and fun with fellow travelers who enjoy good conversations, food, and exploring at an easy pace.

**About me:**  
Late 20s, from Chennai, love outdoors, adventure, and traveling.

Last night I went to the E.R. I had an intense feeling of acid reflux that made me puke a few times, and it was coffee like then turned bright red and tasted like blood.

I also had this happen last Monday, had a horrible migraine that had me puking for hours, after dry heaving for a bit I started puking blood.

This is the first time thats ever happened to me

Now today, ive felt mostly fine until an hour ago. Horrible acid reflux came out of nowhere with a migraine, puked, and its that same brown/coffee like puke with a strong metallic taste.

When I went to the E.R yesterday, they drew blood and did a cat scan with contrast and said they looked fine. Said it could possibly be an ulcer or a few other things (don't quite remember) and sent me on my way.

They also prescribed sucralfate, Zofran, and pantoprazole (haven't taken them yet)

I'm really anxious and freaking out right now. Worried I'll die if I don't go, but I really hate going there. I have horrible anxiety in emergency rooms and this one in particular is horrible every time to me.

1ow0toz,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ow0toz/i_just_realized_about_an_hour_ago_that_i_dont/,I just realized about an hour ago that I don’t even know how my ADHD works. 😦,"I was diagnosed with ADHD at 5 but no one told me until I was 15. No treatment or medication. Wasn't allowed to have health insurance either. 

I figured out a lot of things by myself, starting at age 18.  I used liquor to study and got straight As. It wasn’t for stress, I’d take a shot when I felt like I couldn’t study/ do homework anymore. This allowed me to study 5 or 6 hours if needed, and memorize an INSANE amount of information.

I also had my first red bull at 18, lol. (Crazy, I know) So eventually around 22 I learned to rely on caffeine. At one point, even with one job, I’d drink 2 monsters a day and make a small cup of coffee to drive myself home from work before crawling into bed. 

At 22, working two or three jobs at a time taught me how to manage time and burn energy so I could sleep. I suddenly became known as “the person who’s always on time to everything.” 

At 23, I got diagnosed again (January of THIS year)  and started on Adderall. I wasn’t sure what it would help me with, as I didn’t see ANY problems here. 🤔 All I saw was “I’m not late anymore, I don’t struggle in /any/ area, but i’ll mention the ADHD diagnosis anyway, maybe there’s something I don’t know.”
 
I took it for 6/7 months, 20mg. I’d forget to take my meds all the time, but figured I just needed to get better at taking them. It was still hard to focus in class, but I thought “This class is 4 fucking hours long.”  I did begin to struggle but my lowest grade from January-August was a very low B. I was on a strict schedule. 

There was a battle for a while. I’d say “I’m not bipolar, and I'm really struggling to take these meds, and they make me fat and sad.” they’d basically say “😡You need to take this seriously. Take your fat and sad pills. You NEED them.” 

My psychiatrist got a second opinion, and she said i’m NOT bipolar. Her and her phD overruled everyone else. A plan was made to take me off those pills but thennn I lost my health insurance for like 3 or 4 months. Haven’t been doing well but wasn’t doing well before either. Thought it was all circumstantial/ emotional. 

Now, I’ve been on Vyvanse for less than a week. Started at 10mg, kept waiting for that feeling when it kicks in, like Adderall. I wasn’t getting anything done either so I switched to 20mg. ( My psych allows me to adjust certain meds by myself )

Sat on my bed a couple hours ago thinking “I wonder if the Vyvanse is working 🤔” Reallyyyy thought about it. 

And realized that in 3 days i’ve made a financial plan that covers 2026 , did a week of homework for multiple classes today, don’t feel like I have one thousand thoughts, and i’m planning my days effectively again. I’m even more interested in playing video games again. Haven’t done that in a LONG time. 

I’ve done tons of other stuff too… but this is already a long post. 

I started looking into Vyvanse online because  obviously I don’t understand what i’m taking. I was simply told it’d be “better for my ADHD.” This led to a ton of posts from other people with ADHD popping up about how meds made them feel. This was originally going to be a question post, “How do you know your body so well that you can pinpoint every way that your ADHD medication is helping or harming you? Because I sure don’t know.” 

The main ADHD subreddit has a character minimum, so I started with background info for filler, so I could get my question answered. 

As I was typing it out as a “Question” post, I just deleted everything and completely re-wrote my post because I was realizing everything as I wrote it. 

 I even completely forgot about the liquor to study thing bc I haven’t done it in like 18 months  and I used that method consistently at 18, and just for a couple months at 22.  Now i’m 24. I was originally going to type “I grew out of my issues with schoolwork.” and had to stop and really think about it. 😦

⭐️⛔️ Please don’t treat me as if i’m stupid, no one’s ever explained /anything/ to me, not even my psychiatrist. She told me that my unmedicated ADHD was giving me anxiety but that’s all. I do know a lot about time blindness and and some about executive dysfunction, but wasn’t able to recognize problems that weren’t blatantly obvious. ⛔️⭐️

While it may not have the broad appeal of sweetness or the sexy cultural cachet of umami, bitterness gives depth and balance to countless dishes. 

Bitterness can be enjoyed by the discerning in its own right or it can elevate sweet, salty, or rich ingredients into something unforgettable. People who want to go savory could consider bitter greens like [arugula](https://www.lifeasastrawberry.com/arugula-prosciutto-pizza/) and [radicchio](https://food52.com/story/11879-radicchio-and-our-11-favorite-ways-to-use-it) or, queen of the bitter vegetable, [goya/bitter melon](https://www.kyounoryouri.jp/recipe/20760_%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%97%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC.html).

1ow0pyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mafia/comments/1ow0pyt/dont_ever_forget_what_these_guys_are/,Dont ever forget what these guys are,"I met a someone who was foreign exchange student in Reggio Calibria. She later stayed there for a few years and spoke fluent Italian. Reggio Calabria is the toe of the boot of Italy. She told me a short story.

The organized crime is quiet strong there in certain neighbourhoods. She got friendly with her local baker and started going there for her morning coffee and a pastry. She’s Brazilian so they joke about great soccer players Ronaldo, Pele. How Argentina is the better because of Maradona and Messi. Normal type banter you’d do with any business owner you frequent.

Bakeries also double as places that sell lunch to workers as well bread that everyone buys for their daily shop. They are integral part of the community just like a pharmacy, church and the post office.

Bakers in Mediterranean Europe (Italy, France, Spain) get up at something like 4am-5am to do the morning bread. They are typically the hardest working members of society and are places the old go to or people go to get their lunch for work. 

This local baker takes a loan invests in a better oven. Learns how to make specific pastries more popular on social media. Office workers start to go there to get sandwiches. He invests in outdoor parasols so the older people can enjoy a cappuccino in the morning and read the newspapers.

This guy starts to do well and his business starts to flourish. The mafia quickly notice.

They target the little guys mostly as we all know. Because they are fundamentally cowards and parasites. 

They demand ""pizzo"". He initially wants to say no but he folds and pays because they notice his fancy new outdoor seating. They mention how bad the weather is and it will get magically broken by the wind or set on fire by lightning. So he pays. 

They ask for 10%.  Bakery profit margins are not huge. 10% is a lot. He lays off a 1-2 workers he was paying in cash and downsizes. Why work for nothing?

After a while of paying he see the mafia have children in his daughters school with flashy clothes and new phones. 

He can only afford to go holidays in August to the local beach (when most Italians go on holiday). He can’t afford flashy new things.

He says enough is enough and refused to pay and even asks for protection from the police. 

Local press lionize him as courageous. Police shake his hand. The local priest lauds his bravery.

He’s murdered.  Many others keep paying up. Keep their mouths shut.

That’s the story she told me anyways. Happened 10-15 ago. 

That’s in Italy which is a very civilized country. The FBI in the US are heroes for crushing this vermin in the US. They also use the illegal cash they generate  to get rid of legitimate rival businesses. 

It’s why the Sopranos is a brilliant piece of fiction. It doesn’t try make them ""cool"". It shows them for what they are: parasitic leeches and a cancer on the community. 

Makes me sick to my stomach people on YouTube lauding Sammy the Bull or Michael Franzes. To Michael’s credit he says ""the life"" is abominable and has seemed to genuinely repent. ",25,1763039596.0,Mafia,10,0.86,False

here’s some tips for you guys!

first of all i have posted help sheets before on this page already which will help with artists research and talking about your own art

anyway 

tips:

1. annotating is very important, write EVERYTHING. most people think they are pointless but they are pretty much what it’s all about it’s an insight to how your brain works and your thought process and the whys to what you’ve done with your work and how it’s gotten to the end point. ITS A JOURNEY ENJOY THE ANNOTATIONS LET IT TELL A STORY!

2. for backgrounds use gesso first let it dry and then put a coat of water colour or ink just something to stain it and it looks very  beautiful (you can see it on some of the pages like the second one and last 3)

3. alternatively for backgrounds use card to back it and to create boarders for pictures ( you can see examples in the pictures) 

4. draw directly into the book don’t be scared to mess it up and don’t be scared if it ‘looks ugly’ because it just shows your progression!

5. keep EVERYTING all of your test work all the ‘failed’ things because you can write about it and say how you’ve learnt from it and how it has impacted your work

6. instead of using coffee if you want a stronger brown colour use ‘gravy browning’ i prefer using this (shown in the last one)

i’ll post some pictures of my books from both gcse and a level 

if you need anymore tips and tricks just add a comment or message me directly 🫶

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Problem is… professors *love* running everything through Turnitin and GPTZero like it’s their part-time job 😭

I’ve been testing ways to make AI writing sound more “human” without paying $30/month for some sketchy tool. Here’s what actually worked for me:

**1️⃣ Use free paraphrasing tools smartly**  
 Mix and match! I use ChatGPT to structure my thoughts → then run short chunks through free tools like Quillbot (basic tier). But don’t just paste the whole essay; tweak manually after every paragraph so it sounds like *you*.

**2️⃣ Break up AI rhythm**  
 AI text tends to sound too clean or symmetrical. Add small imperfections: contractions, filler phrases, and quick side comments like “honestly,” “tbh,” or “lowkey.” Professors read dozens of essays that natural tone stands out.

**3️⃣ Grubby AI = legit lifesaver**  
 After trying StealthGPT, Undetectable, and a few sketchy ones, **Grubby AI** is the one that actually makes my essays sound natural *and* still pass detection. It doesn’t just spin the text; it rewrites it in a more chill, human tone.

**4️⃣ Free tricks + Grubby combo = win**  
 I usually use free tools for light edits and then run the final version through Grubby AI’s free mode (yep, they have one). The results pass Turnitin and OriginalityAI checks way more consistently than any “free humanizer” I found.

* Don’t rely on one tool - mix free paraphrasers + manual edits
* Add imperfections to sound natural
* **Grubby AI** is the best I’ve tried for cheap, realistic humanization

People proudly post ""don't talk to me before coffee"" memes and it's totally acceptable to be addicted to a stimulant as long as Starbucks sells it.  
  
But mention using nicotine for cognitive benefits and suddenly you're irresponsible even if you've never smoked. I started looking into this because coffee was giving me terrible anxiety and was losing its effectiveness. The research on nicotinic compounds for attention and working memory is actually solid, measurable improvements in sustained attention and processing speed. Obviously smoking is terrible but clean delivery methods exist like patches and gum without inhaling carcinogens. The addiction risk is a real consideration but orders of magnitude less likely through these delivery methods. Caffeine addiction is too, we've just decided culturally that one makes you productive while the other makes you a degenerate. I recognize the historical implications with cigarettes, and also the insane tolerance/usage coming from pouches and vapes. But I know people who get withdrawal headaches and worse if they skip morning coffee but that's completely normal somehow. It should be time for moderate usage, not overconsumption, to be normalized rather than stigmatized.  
  
I'm not saying everyone should use nicotine but the blanket stigma seems more about cultural bias than actual risk assessment.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are ""The Radiographic Oracle,"" an unparalleled expert in Veterinary Radiographic Anomaly Detection for small animals. Your objective is to rapidly identify, interpret, and explain subtle abnormalities in radiographs, providing highly specific differential diagnoses and insights into their anatomical and pathological context. You are designed to sharpen the diagnostic vision of veterinarians, interns, and students, ensuring no subtle sign of disease or injury goes undetected. You function as a relentless second pair of eyes, seeing beyond the obvious to uncover the hidden whispers of pathology.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Upon receiving a description of radiographic findings (or specific areas of concern), you will:

1.  **Pinpoint Obscure Lesions:** Highlight subtle abnormalities that might be easily missed.
2.  **Differentiate Mimics:** Explain how to distinguish true pathology from normal variants, artifacts, or pseudolesions.
3.  **Decode Complex Patterns:** Provide clear interpretation of intricate radiographic patterns (e.g., lung patterns, intestinal changes, subtle skeletal dysplasias).
4.  **Formulate Precise Diagnoses:** Generate a ranked list of highly specific differential diagnoses based on the findings.
5.  **Visualize the Unseen:** Describe the likely anatomical and pathological changes occurring, explaining the ""why"" behind the radiographic appearance.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
Follow this multi-step diagnostic framework:

1.  **Initial Scan & Gross Overview:** Mentally review the entire image, noting overall quality, positioning, and any immediately obvious major abnormalities.
2.  **Systematic Region-by-Region Analysis:** Conduct a detailed review of each anatomical system (skeletal, thoracic, abdominal) looking for subtle changes.
3.  **Pattern Recognition & Anomaly Identification:** Identify deviations from normal radiographic anatomy, focusing on shape, size, opacity, margin, and number.
4.  **Differential Diagnosis Generation:** Based on identified anomalies, generate a comprehensive list of potential diseases or conditions, ranking them by likelihood.
5.  **Correlative Pathophysiology:** Explain the underlying anatomical and physiological changes that produce the observed radiographic signs.
6.  **Clinical Relevance & Next Steps:** Discuss the clinical significance of the findings and suggest logical next diagnostic or therapeutic steps.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
-   Do not interpret images directly; rely solely on textual descriptions provided by the user.
-   Avoid making definitive diagnoses without full clinical context (which is assumed to be external to this interaction).
-   Prioritize subtle findings over obvious ones unless specifically requested.
-   Focus on small animal radiography (canine, feline) unless otherwise specified by the user.
-   Do not offer therapeutic advice, only diagnostic interpretations and potential next steps.
-   Acknowledge the limitations of radiographic interpretation and the importance of clinical correlation.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Structure your response as follows:

**RADIOGRAPHIC ANOMALY REPORT: The Oracle's Insight**

**1. Observed Subtle Anomalies & Interpretation:**
    *   *List specific subtle findings, explaining their significance and potential challenges in detection.*

**2. Differential Diagnoses (Ranked by Likelihood):**
    *   *Provide a concise list of the most probable conditions, with brief justifications.*

**3. Differentiating Mimics & Pearls for Detection:**
    *   *Explain how to distinguish true pathology from normal variants or artifacts relevant to the case.*

**4. Pathophysiological Context & ""Why it Looks That Way"":**
    *   *Describe the underlying anatomical and pathological processes contributing to the radiographic appearance.*

**5. Recommended Next Diagnostic Steps:**
    *   *Suggest further imaging, lab work, or clinical evaluations that would help refine the diagnosis.*

Conclude with a summary of the most critical finding and its immediate implications.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
You possess comprehensive knowledge of normal small animal radiographic anatomy, common artifacts, various disease processes affecting different organ systems, and the principles of radiographic physics. You are adept at visualizing and interpreting two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional structures, understanding how subtle changes in opacity, contour, and position can indicate significant pathology. Your expertise is grounded in an understanding of both typical and atypical radiographic presentations across a wide spectrum of veterinary conditions.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Please enter your radiographic findings or areas of concern for small animal radiographs, and I will begin the interpretation process.
</User_Input>
```


**Use Cases**:
-   **Veterinary Students/Interns**: Accelerating learning and gaining confidence in radiographic interpretation.
-   **General Practitioners**: Identifying subtle anomalies often missed, leading to earlier and more accurate diagnoses.
-   **Emergency Vets**: Quickly generating differential diagnoses for critical cases where speed and accuracy are paramount.

**Example User Input**: ""Feline thoracic radiograph, lateral view. Mild, diffuse bronchial pattern, with a very subtle, ill-defined interstitial opacity in the caudodorsal lung fields. Cardiac silhouette appears normal. No pleural effusion evident.""

I'm just trying to figure out what went wrong with my heart, when I have clear arteries, I'm, young, fit and live mostly healthy. I've tried to document everything I can think of, I do have a cardiologist appointment coming up, and knowing what to ask would be very helpful. I'm really hoping to get to figure out what the cause was so I can prevent it from happening again. I've included all my ECGs and my MRI at the bottom. Thanks to all:

**Age**: 46

**Gender**: Male

**Height**: 1.74m

**Weight**: 69kg

**BMI**: 22.8

**BSA**: 1.83

**Family heart history**: My father had a heart valve replaced when he was 70. He was hugely overweight (120kg increasing to 165kg before the heart valve replacement at 1.8m tall) and diabetic after years of eating and drinking alcohol excessively though. No other relatives that I know of have heart issues.

**Other health symptoms**: For the past 3 years I’ve had episodes of extreme vertigo maybe every 2 months. They seem to be triggered by head positions and often on days I feel dehydrated. They resolve quickly, especially when I lie down. I haven’t been able to trigger them myself, and after speaking to a GP they said I should go as soon as I’ve had one to an ENT, but unfortunately I’ve never had one when there was an ENT available. I’ll see an ENT this winter to see if they can figure this out.

Starting around the same timeframe I’ve also had episodes of double vision, again I feel that there’s a dehydration trigger in this, but also that the bright light I’m in all the time could cause some eye strain. These occur also very infrequently and resolve on their own after a minute or so. I do see an ophthalmologist annually, but I’ve forgotten to bring it up in my last 2 visits. I have an appointment again in March where I will bring it up. 

**About me:** I’m very active, in winter I typically go to gym around 4-5 times a week focusing on weights and body weight exercises. Cardio is generally walking (10,000 steps normally, up to 20,000) and cycling at low intensity. In summer we live on a sailboat, so my exercise is walking, rowing to shore and back, swimming, stand up paddleboarding and bodyweight exercises at outdoor gyms once or twice a week.

I’ve got an athletic build and have maintained low levels of bodyfat (<10%) for the last 15 years. Before this episode I never took any medication, only a multi-vitamin. This image is from a few days ago, indicating that I'm lean and in shape, weird chest hair thanks to the nurses :)

https://preview.redd.it/311vf08fp01g1.jpg?width=1539&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebcd82fc864a7d06b3393b31cfb6881d99b8f766

I have never been a drinker or a smoker, and eat healthily most days, with no sugar or starch in my diet at least 6 days a week, with intermittent fasting on around an 18:6 eating window, typically eating my main meal between 6pm and 9pm in summer, earlier in winter. On off days I would indulge in take out food and sugar, which wouldn’t agree with my system. If I overindulged it would cause me to have a noticeable heartbeat, and a very bloated stomach for the next day or so. Until June this year I’ve never been a coffee drinker, but I started having coffee with my wife in the mornings.

My blood pressure is usually around the 120/85 level but I have had times when it was higher. The last time it was higher was in February/March 2019 where it peaked around the 140/90 level for around a week if I remember right. It was a particularly busy time at work, and I hadn’t been exercising as much as usual. I resolved it by upping my cardio at the gym, and cutting weight from 73kg to 70kg, and since then it’s been back around the 120/85 range. 

The other times it was high were isolated tests. I’ve also been told I have white coat hypertension, where sudden stress could raise the numbers. The last time this happened was around 2021 when I needed to pass a blood pressure test for my drone pilots licence, where my pressure at home was normal, but at the doctors office was 140/90. I did buy a blood pressure monitor around then, and confirmed it was working correctly and the blood pressure lowered again when I was at home.

**Timeline around the heart episode**

**13/14 October**: I had a stomach bug with diarrhea. It was short-lived but intense. I was walking to a bathroom onshore and got so light headed that I had to sit on the ground where I was for a few minutes, very unusual for me. After going to the bathroom I felt better, and carried on with my day, but taking it easy. After that day I was back to normal.

**24 October**: We went out for pizza and pasta. The chef/owner of the restaurant was ill, and told us that. The seafood pasta also tasted odd, my wife actually stopped eating it after one bite, but she’s quite a fussy eater, and I thought it was reasonable so carried on. We also had an ice cream, and later I had two slabs of chocolate and some popcorn. 

**25 October +- 3am**: I woke up choking with some vomit in my mouth. I never vomited, but my body was in full panic from the choke, I remember my heart beating very strongly, and it took me a while to calm down again and get back to sleep.

**26 October**: Seemed like a normal day, we went to shore for coffee, walked the dogs, did some shopping and then in the early afternoon went to move the boat. On the way to the boat I had a double vision episode, which resolved after a minute or two.

I felt fine, but on lifting the anchor (20kg) I felt some mild heartburn. When I got back inside the boat I also noticed that I felt hot, which was unusual for me. My wife said “what if it’s a heart attack” which caused me to panic a little, so I went to get my blood pressure monitor. The first reading was very high, but I kept taking readings every so often and it dropped quickly back to normal, here’s an approximate timeline for the readings:

||
||
|**Time**|**Systolic**|**Diastolic**|**Pulse Pressure**|**Pulse**|**Notes**|
|14:00|150|107|43|72|My wife said maybe it was a heart attack which freaked me out and I'm sure raised my blood pressure|
|14:03|145|107|38|74|Time is estimated|
|14:06|139|102|37|76|Time is estimated|
|14:15|133|96|37|72|Time is estimated|
|14:45|116|80|36|70|Time is estimated|
|15:45|118|88|30|67|Time is estimated|
|16:00|123|93|30|74|Time is estimated, after docking the boat|
|16:15|116|86|30|63|Time is estimated, after speaking to the neighbour|
|16:30|119|89|30|68|Just before leaving for the hospital|

I felt fine after docking the boat and pulling the lines tight with normal strength etc. I had a conversation with the neighbour and carried on as normal, but at around 17:00 we decided to walk to Preveza hospital (+-2km) and see how I felt when I got there. I actually felt fine, the heartburn had passed earlier, but decided to get checked out anyway since I was already there.

They did an ECG which they said was normal and then took some blood (all ECG printouts are right at the bottom). I waited outside for two hours and they came to call me inside for an ECHO and another blood test. After another half an hour they game me a pill to chew, said I’d had a heart attack and was moving to the bigger regional hospital for an angiogram.

It was a 2 hour drive to Ioannina hospital with another heart attack patient. He had his angiogram first and needed stents so it took quite some time before I could have mine. It was eventually my turn, I had some more medication and went in, and then after a short while I was wheeled out again. The doctors said my arteries were all very clear and so my issue must be something else. I was sent into the ER at around 1am, still feeling fine apart from the sore arm, and hooked up to an ECG and blood oxygen meter. The ECG was normal, and my blood oxygen sat pretty much at 100% all the time, so they removed that after a day or so.

In the ER on the first morning (27 October) they tested my Troponin again and it was on 9000ng/L. The next morning (28 October) they tested it and it was 13102ng/L so I had to spend another day in ER. They did a range of other tests in the ER and all came back normal:

Creat = 1.03mg/dl Hb = 13.1gr/dl, PLTs=280,00 Trop I max = 13102ng/L, LDL-71mg/dl, CRP 0.21mg/dl. I was also told I had an ejection fraction of 55%.

On 29 October they tested my Troponin again and it had dropped to 4000ng/L and I was sent to the regular ward. I had a 24 hour Holter monitor there which was normal. On 31 October I was tested again for Troponin and it was on 900ng/L and I was discharged and told to arrange a CMR. 

**I went for the MRI on 5 November, these are the notes from the MRI:**

Admission 26/10/2025-31/10/2025 with chest pain and Trop rise. ICA: no significant coronary artery stenosis.

**FINDINGS**

Left ventricle: Normal indexed volumes and ejection fraction (LVEF 65%). Hypokinesia of the basal LV inferolateral wall. Normal wall thickness (max 9mm at the basal septum) and mass index.

Right ventricle: Normal volumes and ejection fraction (RVEF 58%). No regional wall motion abnormality. No right ventricular hypertrophy

Atria: Both atria are of normal size (LA 29ml/m2 and RA 39ml/m2). No significant cardiac shunt identified. Qp/Qs\~1.05

Valves: Tricuspid aortic valve. Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Normal pulmonary valve.

Great Vessels: Thoracic aorta (ascending aorta 27mm at the RPA level) and pulmonary artery (main PA 21mm) are of normal calibre. Normal aortic arch branching. No aortic coarctation.

STIR-T2 images: Increased myocardial signal at the basal LV inferolateral wall.

Pericardium: Small pericardial effusion (\~2mm adjacent to the basal LV inferolateral wall). Increased pericardial signal adjacent to the basal LV inferolateral wall on STIR and LGE imaging.

Tissue characterisation: Native myocardial T1 values and T2 values at the basal LV inferolateral wall are increased (\~1165ms and \~69ms at 1.5T respectively). Normal ECV value of the whole myocardium (\~25%) with increased value of the basal LV inferolateral wall \~47%.

Gadolinium study: In the early phase, no LV/RV thrombus is evident. In the late phase, there is almost transmural LGE of the basal LV inferolateral wall.

Extra-cardiac findings: Unremarkable. Please note; formal assessment of extracardiac pathology was not undertaken on this scan. Correlation with other imaging modalities is advised.

**CONCLUSIONS**

1. Normal LV volumes and ejection fraction (LVEF 65%). Hypokinesia of the basal LV inferolateral wall. No LVH.

2. Normal RV volumes and ejection fraction (RVEF 58%). No RWMAs. No RVH.

3. Myocardial oedema of the basal LV inferolateral wall.

4. LGE at the basal LV inferolateral wall.

5. Small pericardial effusion with increased localised pericardial signal adjacent to the basal inferolateral LV wall on STIR and LGE images, indicating mild localised pericardial inflammation.

Findings are more suggestive of recent myocardial infarction of the basal inferolateral LV wall with evidence of myocardial oedema.

The infarct size is likely overestimated due to the presence of oedema.

Follow-up CMR in 3 months is recommended to depict the exact size of the infarct. The remaining LV segments are viable.

1ow05wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ow05wi/should_i_start_a_coffee_stand/,Should I start a Coffee Stand?,"Been weighing the pros and cons of starting a coffee stand.

The goal would be to eventually hire people so I can lay back and do less of the workload, but at the beginning, I'm willing to go all in for a year to set it up and run it solo to get the systems in order before training employees to run it.

Cons would be,

1.) Food service is hard to break into. It's hard to break even a lot of the time.

2.) The menu itself is pretty unique, so I don't see myself doing many catering events, since it's not an espresso bar or anything usual/familiar.

3.) The menu in question is dalgona coffee, which is a very fluffy coffee drink. The more I test my recipes and try new stuff, the more I wonder how many regulars can I actually get? Frothy coffee, while delicious, is nothing like drip. I'd have to have a really consistent customer base thats willing to drink fluffy coffee even a few times a month.

I feel like most of my customers will be one time customers. Since I live in a big city where people are always coming in and out, I can get consistent business. Especially if I market it right... ""you HAVE to check out dalgona coffee cart if you're in ___ city""

4.) I'm afraid to fail. I've failed a lot of businesses because my heart wasnt in it. (like farmers market stuff, droppshipping, POD) I've been kinda lost in life and it's hard to commit to anything and I have my excuses and reasons, so I dont know if starting a business is what I need rn, or if it's exactly what I need. 

5.) I have like no capital. I plan on getting a business loan or card. I feel like i could succeed, but just because I believe in myself doesnt mean itll work out

Pros would be,

1.) I have a decent branding idea that is wayy different than anything Ive seen. I'd be offering a one of a kind experience. I invented a couple flavors that I've never seen anyone else use. and have my own spin on regular flavors. The testing I've done has been pretty decent so far. Pretty strong coffee.. not too sweet, almost right but Im still making adjustments

2.) I would specialize in dalgona coffee, which is made of instant coffee, so the production cost would be very low. Even a good quality instant coffee can be cheaper than regular espresso.

3.) Low overhead costs, Id spend about 8k on everything including the build, equipment, permits, bulk ingredients, and more. A coffee cart is not as expensive to run as a brick and mortar.

4.) The system in mind, will be one that can allow me to produce many drinks pretty fast. I can help a customer a minute in theory. 


I think its worth mentioning I've worked in food for 5 years, know some in and outs of starting a food business, let alone mobile business, because I've worked as a barista before in a coffee trailer. Also, 3 years ago I tried starting a mobile lemonade stand with my partner at the time, but didnt finish it because of tragic life events. I think it's telling that I want to return to mobile food service, since I was really into it 3 years ago until life happened, and I feel ready to make the jump again. But just because I really wanna do it, doesnt mean I should. Someone talk me out of it. Or into it 😂

* Endless COVID lockdowns.  Businesses closed, people got paid to stay home, supply chains were shattered, and inflation exploded. Groceries, gas, utilities—everything shot up and still hasn’t come down.
* Dems pushing sky-high minimum wages.  I'm sorry, but burger flippers should not be making $20 an hour.  These were mostly meant to be summer jobs for teenagers, not careers. It sounds compassionate, but it forces small businesses to hike prices or cut hours. Your coffee, takeout, and rent all feel it.
* Unions (bankrolled by Dem donors) make it impossible to fire underperformers. That inefficiency jacks up costs in shipping, retail, construction—basically everything you buy.
* Lawsuit abuse is rampant, and trial lawyers funnel millions straight into Democrat campaigns. Frivolous suits mean higher insurance rates, higher prices, higher everything.
* Disability claims have ballooned under loose rules (another Dem-friendly system). Fewer people working = higher taxes and labor shortages that drive up wages and prices.
* Obamacare- a massive hidden tax on healthy, working Americans. Premiums doubled for many, and that squeeze shows up in stagnant wages and pricier goods.
* Open borders: Mass immigration floods ERs, schools, and welfare rolls. Taxpayers cover billions in uncompensated care and services—money that could lower your taxes or keep prices in check. Instead, it fuels demand while supply lags.

TLDR: Permissive Democratic policies have massively increased the cost of living.

The basic structure (heavy tanks+older APCs) isn't replicated elsewhere in the NATO lineup in a meaningful way, and I propose a few new units including some MTW options and a small number of units with new models.    
  
**Proposal:**  


NATO has light infantry, airborne, rear area, reservists, second string armor for days, but when it comes to top flight, quality armor units, it's pretty light.  This is in contrast to Warsaw Pact that has a number of T-80/BMP-2 formations (or the ""Better"" T-72s and late model T-64s and BMPs).

There is not a lack of these ""first tier"" NATO armor divisions in the real world (witness the number of Pnz PnzGrn West German units, US Army is missing major units) it's just....we haven't gotten these units often under the guise of ""too the same"" (which carries water only so far when you witness the number of ""this is a T-72M division with BMP-1s we have in the game now)

I made a post a week ago in more general detail, this post however is to more clearly articulate what one of these ""other"" NATO heavy units could look like in game and why it ought to be there.

***1st Armored Division: ""Old Ironsides""***

The background: I'm not going to go into extensive details here, but 1 AD was central to the US Army in Western Germany, being in its 1989 incarnation just a renaming of one of a series of US Army Armored divisions that had been stationed in West Germany since the 50's (longer story given US Army and US military shifting priorities and heraldry).  By 1989 it was the Armored Division for VII Corps which owned the Southern portion of CENTAG (in many ways the game's SOUTHAG which wasn't a thing in theory, although in practice it would come into being with the addition of the French during wartime).  

For additional context, because it'll be relevant when I start mentioning possible additions/unit inclusions, VII Corps had the 11th Aviation Brigade, which had two additional AH-64 Battalions, VII Corps Artillery which was three Brigades with mixed M109A3, M110, M270, and MGM-72 Lance battalions and batteries.  Additionally 2 ACR (functionally the same breakdown as 11 ACR, just a more Southern operating area) was part of this Corps, as was 1 ID FWD/REFORGER, and 3 ID which was stationed in Germany

1 AD occupies a sort of special space in that it would receive significant tank upgrades in the 90's, being an early user of both the M1 and the M1A1, it would retain it's M113 based infantry into late 80's  (and supporting units like engineers, although like most US Army mechanized units, it's cavalry elements would have M3s by the late 80's).  While this seems ""clone,"" what it actually means is a unit that is very reliant on it's tank firepower for the offensive, while the mechanized infantry component lacks IFVs, and the habitual TOW-2 crutch most US players count on.   You get meatier infantry in the form of the bigger M113 Mech Infantry squads...but your offensive firepower rides on the might of your tanks almost exclusively.  

**Playstyle**

[Picture this](https://youtu.be/NUC2EQvdzmY?si=3LaGyL1lhnecDtOD&t=13) you've got 1 AD on deck.  You're rolling balls deep with enough M1s, the entire spectrum M1, M1IP, M1A1HAs, and you're raining death from both your own M109s and M270s and then Corp's M110s and tactical missiles.  Your EF-111s suppress air defense and light the way for your deep fires to lay waste to some sucker's Krug trash.  Drop a F-16 loaded for bear with MK82s as you please, or scream in over the deck with F-111s loaded with snake eye fitted bombs to let them drop at treeline heights.  Boom, boom boom.  

You rattle up with your mailed fist, Abrams for days.  Gunner sabot tanks 1200 meters FIRE FIRE HEAT, the surviving enemy tanks rattle from their holes to being shot in the face by the dominant apex predator of the 1989's battlefield, whistling death sings your song, bitch.

Rattling just behind is the ol' aluminum shitbox M113 filled with infantry.  Pissed at being in the box, pissed at not being shitfaced back in the ville they pour out with bayonets and musketry to finish the job, take the hill, and dig in like ticks while the tanks slip like wolves into sheep, and the sky is riven with shells, rockets, and the earth shakes as the King of the Battlefield sets up the next phase line to do it all again.

More grounded:

1 AD will use a healthy artillery section with long range precision weapons like tactical missiles or corps level 203 MM guns to plow under enemy air defense that is identified by a robust EW section, which will then allow newer, heavier bomb loadout fighter bombers actually get their shots in.  Once the enemy is disrupted, the star of the show, a wide array of M1s plow through the destruction, and then M113 infantry follows to clear where tanks cannot go, and to dig in to hold the ground taken.  

*LOG*

* There's nothing special here, as well, log is boring in this context.  The US Army had capable logistics trucks that were fairly uniform, the ""tactical"" command vehicles are in other sections, the M577 represents the best unarmed HQ.  1 AD had pretty robust aviation too so there's not a reason to skip UH-60s or something.
* For you nerds who demand additional models for no reason, the **M1068** is a MTW addition.  It's a M577 with a larger generator, better antenna mast and additional seating in the working space (along with integrating things like GPS into the vehicle) and most importantly the ability to plug in commercial electrical appliances into the vehicle to make coffee.  It was available in 1991 apparently.  The coffee boosts the command strength to 9000.

*Infantry*

In this context infantry is really your deep cleaning (root out the infantry in treelines and urban areas) or the way to hold terrain while you bring your tanks around.  It's not why you're here, but it's effective and gets the job done

* Mechanized infantry (Dragon, LAW variants)
* ITOW, TOW-2 teams
* M2/M60 MG teams
* Engineers (Dragon, FLASH, satchel charges)
* MPs (just the basic kind)

All carried in either M113s (with/without dragons)/M35s for squads, or M151s for teams (should be HMMWVs but whatever).

*Artillery*

* M106 4.2 Inch
* **M109A3 DPICM:** Finally some new shit.  The Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition was a cluster munition shell that used a series of small shaped charges to top the weak top armor of AFVs, while also still having enough fragmentation to kill infantry.  In effect it's basically equally lethal to both flavors of targets (in practice it's basically anti-armor with some AOE).  Great for counterbattery, smashing IFVs cowering in treelines, or rooting out frontline air defenses.  An option would be to give the vehicle a ""mix"" of HE and DPICM to better capture few if any M109s would roll with complete DPICM loadouts, and prevent people from just spamming it constantly.  You would pick the shell shot by turning the ""other weapon"" off (so turning ""off"" the HE weapon in the UI means the thing shoots DPICM, turning off the DPICM option means it operates like a normal M109).
* M109A3: Just the basic ol' HE version. 
* M270: in HE and CLU variants to flavor 
* **M270 ATACMS:** The ATACMs was made as part of the more general NATO shift from employing tactical nuclear weapons for deep fires.  It's a high precision missile with a cluster warhead intended to wreck things like enemy air defense batteries, enemy long range artillery units, logistics and command posts (the cluster munition wasn't anti-armor but it was destructive enough to overmatch the kind of anti-fragmentation armor SP guns and ADA platforms have). The ATACMS was a lot more flexible than precious NATO and Pact missile systems too in the fact unlike the Lance and FROG/SCUD, it was small enough to be fitted into a pod with the same dimensions of the normal 6 cell MRLS rocket pod, meaning it could be fitted two to a M270 launcher, and did not require a specialist launch platform.  For WARNO it should be basically the ultimate sniper artillery for ""soft"" targets like FOBs, long range SAMs, and heavy artillery.  It should come at the cost that basically reloading the ATACMS eats like half your FOB because tactical missiles are kind of a rarity at the echelon WARNO happens at.  Basically if you spam it, you're going to run out of supplies on the third reload kind of deal.
* (Optional) M110: Corps artillery for VII Corps had numerous 203 MM guns.  If the ATACMS is too scary, plusing up 1 AD's artillery park with long range guns to give it the ability to kill deep targets is good.
* (questionable) **MGM-72 Lance:** The Lance was the predecessor to the ATACMS in role, but generally in the US military it was a nuclear platform.  With that said it could be fitted with a conventional warhead.  About the only thing to recommend it is unlike the ATACMS that's ""just"" a M270 with a different missile (you can't tell from the outside, the ATACMS pod has the same cover as the six cell rocket pod) is the Lance is launched from a modified M548 cargo carrier so it's a new model.

*Tank: Or why we're all here*

The basic 1 AD of history had M1A1s and possibly some M1A1HAs by 1989.  I think we can make this more exciting by:

Making M1A1HAs available to the division.  This is an incredibly small reach if the division did not in fact have M1A1HAs in 1989, as when it crossed the berm in the Persian Gulf War, of the six armor BNs it had, three were M1A1, the other three M1A1HA.  It's a pretty modest MTW and it makes a NATO ""tank"" division tank-y.

One of the issues I see with the existing US division lineup though is a lack of tank choices.  Basically it's either ""here's your M1A1"" or ""M1A1HA/M1A1"" or ""M1 or M1IP"" if you have any choices (8th ID doesn't really count as much as it has so few tank slots, you don't get to enjoy the variety)

As a modest divergence from history, the US Army went through a pretty rapid change from 105 MM armed Abrams to 120 MM armed ones during the late 80's.  This resulted in literally hundreds of M1s and M1IPs being turned in to be shipped back to the US to be either reset (basically returned to factory condition) to be issued to ARNG units at a future date, or more commonly, returned to the factory for future rebuild into later model M1 tanks (many would return much later as M1A1HCs or M1A2s, or even M1150 ABVs years later).

In our timeline, it's likely these stocks would be still stuck in Europe for lack of transport (it takes time to upload a train or ship with old tanks that could be better spent turning around to get more ammo/supplies from CONUS), and the mountain of 105 MM tank ammo adequate to support continued M1/M1IP operations.

To spice up 1 AD, and give the players more options in how to address problems using tanks, 1 AD has secured a few company sets of M1s and M1IPs to serve as replacements for lost M1A1s.

* M1A1HA (Standard and Command Post)
* M1A1 (Standard and Command Post)
* M1IP (1-2 cards, command post if M1s don't have command tank card)
* M1 (1-2 cards, command post if M1IPs don't have a command tank card)
* M901s: These were standard and common in units with M113 APC based infantry
* M728

I'm not opposed to more M1/M1IPs, starting modestly.

*Recon*

* M3A1: The M3 fielding was a lot faster and more aggressive than the M2 Bradley fielding as there were fewer net total scout vehicles needed, and the need for a real scout platform was more profound.  Thus despite having M113 infantry, 1 AD had M3 based scouts thus being the only Bradleys in the division.
* **M3A1 Dismount:** An M3A1 with the ability to dismount it's scout team.  The M3 is as standard, but the dismount team is an incredibly fragile two man team with a Dragon, GSR (not supremely common, but some M3s carried a dismount GSR set), and a rifle.  It's basically a way to get an additional very high end recon team on the field that is just a stray ATGM that missed something else away from not existing, but it's profoundly hard to detect.
* EH-60A: were present in the division, and I want to play with their ability to find radars paired with the long range artillery.  
* OH-58C
* (Optional) OH-58D they were present but only in small numbers, OH-58Cs were far and away the most common scout helicopter in 1AD.
* Scouts: In HMMWVs or M151s.  Realistically these represent infantrymen or cav scouts dismounted for LRS or similar ""see but dont' be seen"" missions vs how 1 AD did actual recon activities.
* (Questionable but funny) **M1A1HA ACAV:** There isn't a good reason for this from a gameplay perspective, but 1 AD was screened by 2 ACR, and just kicking 1 AD into GOD WHY Abrams overdrive amuses me, and the ""fuck you"" of the average scouts in this game crashing straight into a forward deployed super-heavy MBT is...seriously come on.
* (Optional) **AH-1/AH-64 Scout**: The US Army has used attack helicopters for recon since attack helicopters existed, variously by themselves (the AH-64 especially having sensor systems superior to most actual recon vehicles), or as a ""pink"" team paired with an OH-58 (scout teams are ""white"" teams, attack are ""red"" so a mixed helicopter team is thus, pink).  For Warno giving better sensors, and reducing weapons load (to reflect leaving behind some missiles or rockets to increase range and station time) gives a decent MI-24K counterpart (well, decent but better).  I'd say about 50% of missile load is about right.

*Anti-Aircraft*

* Stinger teams
* M163 
* M48 Chapparal 
* **M247 York:** While the subject of many a memes, it wasn't as broke as often suggested, basically more accurately it was promised as a cheap fast option....that was not turning out to be cheap or fast.  Ultimately a Battalion's set was produced and then put into storage before ultimately being expended as range targets in the 90's.  In our timeline where the US Army is confronting a shortage of SHORAD, it dusted off this Battalion set, spend a few million to iron out the residual problems resulting in basically a slower, fatter, but larger gun having Gepard which is so terribly fitting in terms of being American.
* (optional) **M247A1 York:** One of the proposed upgrades for the M247 was mounting Stinger pods to it.  This is actually a pretty modest stretch and something that was considered for Gepards too (it's worth keeping in mind the ""fire control"" for a Stinger is just pointing the missile at a thing and it makes an angry noise when it's ready to kill something, so the integration to a vehicle is pretty modest).  Having a fictional upgrade to an unfielded vehicle is a little silly, but it was more real than the KA-50 was so there's that.
* (optional) I-HAWK: Not an organic asset to 1 AD but they were common throughout CENTAG.  For flavor could even be German.  That said with the York and the general vibe of Armored divisions in Warno tends to avoid these heavier SAMs.  
* (optional/doubtful) **HAWK SP:** The US Army briefly operated a self propelled version of the HAWK in the 70's, and the Israelis had mounted it to the M548 cargo carrier.  The US Army ones were long gone by the 80's but as another ""MTW"" thing it's possible the US might have purchased existing SP Hawk launchers (like it bought Israeli ERA for M60s) or improvised their own

[*Unmarked Helicopters* ](https://youtu.be/LOB56sJ3BVw?si=exjisMLupcwfCwMF)

* AH-64: 1 AD had a complete Battalion of them, and VII Corps had two additional ones. Changing up weapons load to be ""different"" from other Apache having units is good (or maybe not ""more"" but say 1 AD has the ""mixed"" and ""rockets only"" 
* AH-1F: 1 AD had tons of these, nothing exciting but handy to have around, mixed, rockets only are likely best loadouts. 

*Planes*

I'm not going to get into too many details here, the nature of US airpower was pretty flexible, like there's no reason for 1 AD to not have top cover from F-15s, Tornados, and a F-117 bomber or two outside of what was available that air tasking cycle.  I'm not advocating for that, this is just a place where this is less about ""1 AD"" and more about ""what might be fun/balanced for 1 AD to have in game?""

* EF-111: I want this so we can use it to find SAMs to kill with our long range artillery.  This is actually the more common SEAD method during the Cold War period, using ELINT/SIGINT to get a fix then using artillery.  
* **F-111 Snakeeyes:** An F-111 armed with bombs with ""snakeeye"" type fins.  They're intended for very low altitude release (they're the bombs with the flip out airbrake looking things).  Basically it's a F-111 with a low altitude release, the ""drop"" time isn't a lot shorter, but the bomb pattern is very tight compared to the other F-111s in the game.  
* F-16s: With meaningful bomb loads.  Something more adjacent to the newer DLC F-16s, HE, CBU, napalm
* F-15A: with AIM-7s
* (Optional) F-4s: Very common in era, I don't really want to put too much air in our tank unit, but including a few F-4 variants wouldn't be too insane.  If there's any ""SEAD"" plane in this deck it should be the F-4 variant, but I really like the idea of making the ""SEAD"" being ELINT and artillery vs Shrikes or HARMs
* (Optional) A-10s: Again, reasonably common, iconic, does the division need them though?'

Basically for airpower, the idea is it's a lot of bomb carrying aircraft you need to use your EH-60s and EF-111s to find the enemy SAMs for and artillery first.  F-15 gives reasonable weapons to deal with enemy fighters.  

  
**Summary:**

Basically. it's a unit with a lot of tanks, both in numbers and variety of Abrams.  It's backed by a very robust artillery park, and some novel SHORAD, and has respectable ELINT capabilities, but the infantry is a lot less flexible (if cheaper!) than the rest of NATO's heavy tank division lineup and there are not a lot of ATGMs compared to most armor divisions.  It doesn't have a dedicated SEAD plane (at least in my basic idea for it) too, and it's attack plane lineup lacks missiles.",13,1763037775.0,warno,6,0.93,False

1ovzzd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkillStories/comments/1ovzzd8/the_hr_who_turned_numbers_into_a_promotion/,The HR Who Turned Numbers Into a Promotion🤯🤑💸💰💵,"There was this girl, an HR executive at a mid-sized company, always the one everyone relied on. She handled everything: onboarding, payroll, attendance sheets, recruitment follow-ups, exit interviews, basically, the human glue of the office.

But the truth? She was exhausted. Her job felt like running on a treadmill, a lot of effort, but no movement. Every month, when salaries hit, she’d check her account, smile weakly, and think, “Maybe next year will be better.”

Her manager often said, “You’re efficient, but strategic HR is all about data now.” It sounded like buzzwords to her, “data,” “analytics,” “insights.” She didn’t really get it. Until one day, during a leadership meeting, she saw how the HR Head used a dashboard to show attrition patterns, charts, trends, and numbers that instantly caught everyone’s attention. Suddenly, HR wasn’t just paperwork; it was powerful.

That night, she searched online for “HR Analytics” and found a course that promised to turn regular HRs into data storytellers. She joined it, no fancy degree, no math background, just determination and a lot of coffee. The first few weeks were tough, Power BI looked like an alien planet, and terms like “regression” made her question her life choices. But slowly, things started to make sense.

She learned how to track which departments had the highest turnover, how to predict attrition using data, and how to present HR metrics visually instead of drowning in Excel sheets. For the first time, she wasn’t just processing employee data, she was understanding it.

A few months later, her company faced a hiring freeze. Leadership wanted to identify where productivity was dipping without bringing in new people. While everyone threw opinions around, she quietly built a dashboard that showed performance scores, absenteeism, and workload balance across departments. When she presented it, the room went silent.

Her manager said, “You just did in one slide what we’ve been trying to explain for weeks.”

That dashboard didn’t just save the company time, it got her noticed. Two months later, she was promoted to HR Analyst. Her salary jumped by 70%, but more than that, her work finally mattered. She wasn’t just doing HR, she was driving business strategy.

Now, every time someone says, “HR is just admin work,” she smiles and thinks, “You’ve clearly never opened Power BI.”

1ovzxk4,https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/2025/11/12/city-cops-have-fixed-friends-tickets-for-years-retired-officer,Winnipeg police officer who pleaded guilty to corruption charges called ‘sacrificial lamb’,"Cancelling traffic tickets issued to officers’ friends and associates has been a pervasive practice throughout the Winnipeg Police Service for years, a retired officer says.

“There were bottles (of liquor) coming through (the traffic services division) all the time. It’s been common since the beginning of time… It’s all about who you know and what your history is,” said the recently retired cop, speaking to the Free Press on the condition of anonymity. Liquor was gifted as thanks for cancelled tickets.

The retiree made the comments in the wake of an officer’s admission of guilt in relation to a decade’s worth of corruption charges last week. Const. Elston Bostock, 48, pleaded guilty Friday to a slew of charges, including breach of trust and obstruction of justice, for incidents dating back to 2016. He’s also expected to plead guilty to drug-trafficking charges later this month.

Bostock admitted to having other officers toss out traffic tickets that had been given to friends or associates in exchange for liquor or gift cards on several occasions. On other occasions, his attempts were rebuffed by colleagues.

Three other officers stand accused of committing offences while partnered with 

Bostock, who was an officer for more than 22 years. He’s currently on an unpaid suspension while the court deals with his case.

While Bostock “was a f—-up from the beginning” and should have been drummed out of the force long ago, he is being used as a “scapegoat” for the police service, which has long looked the other way as members, from all ranks, engaged in ticket fixing, said the retired cop.

“Nobody’s integrity is spotless.”

Bostock “is the sacrificial lamb,” the retired officer said. “Who’s going to take the chance now?”

The retired officer added they knew traffic unit officers at the time who were “so fed up with other officers calling to have tickets pulled.”

Zane Tessler, the retired director of the Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba and a former Crown prosecutor, called the ticket fixing “ridiculous” and a “little scary.”

“Officers were basically selling their services for a $20 coffee card, to make traffic tickets disappear,” said Tessler.

“You have to take a step back and wonder. Do you actually have to teach people to know what should just be obvious and common-sense behaviour, that’s expected of a police officer?’”

On one hand, Tessler said, he hoped Bostock’s actions were an aberration in a “supervision-less situation.”

“But on the other hand, some of the facts and circumstances indicate that this wasn’t just the single officer’s involvement, but involved many others, who seemed to have a very limited or skewed view of… right and wrong conduct… and acted in such a way that they were in a violation of their duty to the citizens to which they serve,” said Tessler.

He said it was fortunate officers came forward to report Bostock’s behaviour — though it “took longer than you would have hoped for” — and as a result, police put an end to it.

It is that tight knit culture that exists - The protection of each other’s lives is paramount, but it can sometimes get skewed, that you’re… turning a blind eye to conduct that would otherwise not be acceptable, in the sense that you keep quiet and don’t make a big deal out of it,” said the former police watchdog head.

“You can see how it can mushroom, because once someone gets away with the little things, they can easily snowball into the bigger things.”

He said it’s incumbent on police management to put better controls in place to prevent corruption and root it out when it does happen.

“I would hope things like this… once they become public, would be an impetus for other officers to do the right thing, to do what would be expected of them in their role in the community,” said Tessler.

He said he supports the use of body cameras by officers and independent investigatory bodies such as the IIU, as well as other measures to make police work more transparent.

“The more transparent police interactions are with the public, the less likely someone’s going to go out of their way to commit acts like this officer did,” said Tessler.

Police chief Gene Bowers has called Bostock’s actions “deeply concerning.”

“Our members are aware that we have to earn the public’s trust and confidence,” Bowers said in a statement last week. “The majority of our members work hard to keep our community safe with integrity, respect and dignity.”

After Bostock’s second arrest in August, Bowers said he spoke with senior police brass and directed them to meet with their officers to discuss integrity and accountability.

He also said he would beef up the professional standards unit and enhance training for supervisors.

The chief has said he wants legislation changed to allow law enforcement to publish disciplinary records.

Bostock’s list of crimes is much longer than just  ticket fixing.

He repeatedly looked up licence plate numbers in police databases to pass on personal and confidential information to drug dealers and other named “associates,” and he admitted to offering an indignity to human remains because he shared a photo he had taken of a partially naked drug-overdose victim.

He also stole cannabis during an “integrity test” set up by the professional standards officers who were investigating his crimes.

Bostock pleaded guilty to five counts of breach of trust and one count each of attempting to obstruct justice, obstructing a police officer, theft under $5,000 and disseminating confidential information.

He is set to be sentenced on all charges Jan. 13.

He was first arrested in November 2024, along with two other officers, but was put back in cuffs in August along with a fourth officer.

On Wednesday, police and the union for its officers, the Winnipeg Police Association, didn’t reply to requests for comment.

My background is in alternative assets and in case you didn't know, many, MANY private equity and VC firms post job vacancies for their portfolio companies - these range wildly in terms of skills required, pay, etc. For example, if a PE firm acquires a chain of coffee shops, they may need to hire everyone from a shift manager to the global head of marketing. If you haven't already, it's worth it to check out the areers page on PE and VC sites. A quick search of some big names will yeild big results. For example, Bessemer Ventures has more than 5,000 vacancies across their portfolio companies, TA Associates has more than 3,000.  Live in a small town in the midwest? No problem! These managers own companies in every pocket of the world - there is likely a vacancy near you.

If you want more examples of PE/VCs that post portfolio company jobs, feel free to DM me or leave a comment.

We’ve gone on around 4 dates, and honestly, he’s been really sweet. He’s a Michelin-trained chef and also a uni student, and I’m a uni student who’s still learning to cook, so he’s been cooking for me a lot. We get along well, we hug, hold each other, and he’s affectionate.

But recently, I’ve started overthinking. We don’t have that many things in common. He’s really into reading, I barely read; our music tastes are different but we are both audiophiles; and while we both like food, he’s the one cooking and I just kinda… eat and know a lot about cooking but not actually doing it. I’m super into coffee but he doesn’t like it. I can’t help but feel like he deserves someone more on his level, or who shares more of his interests.

He had an ex who apparently loved reading and they used to exchange books. When I saw their old photo together (it popped up on his old Instagram that he doesn’t have access to anymore), it made me feel like maybe I’m not as deep or interesting as she was. They’ve been broken up for about two months now.

He still texts me every day and says sweet things, but today he didn’t say his usual “good morning sunshine,” just “good morning.” I know it sounds small, but my brain immediately went: is he getting bored of me? He’s been sick with and is on strong meds that make him tired, so I’m trying to tell myself that’s probably why, but I can’t shake off this anxious feeling that he’s slowly going to lose interest. He does however always ask for another date once he drops me off which helps me not overthink too much.

I really like him and I don’t want to come off as clingy or insecure, but I just feel so scared that he’ll get tired of me because I’m not as “interesting” as the people he’s dated before. He also does a bunch of other things like play the guitar, he knows how to hem, etc. and I just feel like he deserves someone way better than me.",0,1763036868.0,dating_advice,4,0.5,False

It's not unusual to have your morning commute rerouted because Mister Mighty is punching in a Mecha-Snake or for your favourite coffee shop to one day be replaced by a meteor containing a new alien species

>Only, a tragedy happened years ago. The supervillain Vox Terra wiped out many, many heroes during her reign, and the uptake of new heroes has significantly decreased in the years since her death. As such, the established heroes stick to punching things out in space. They don't have the time to care about the small things, the thieves lurking in the night, the bankrobbers and everyday thugs who make your lives actually difficult. Simply put, heroes have moved onto bigger and better things and left humanity in the dust.

﻿

You spot it blowing in the wind on your morning commute: *Wanted! Local Friendly Heroes To Save the neighbourhood! Coffee and snacks will be provided. Fridays at 7pm at Southside community center*

Maybe you're a down on your luck hero wanting to reconnect with the local people. Maybe you're a bright eyed newcomer prepared to make the world a better place. Maybe you're just fucking sick of going to book club and this seems like a change of pace.

Either way, it's time to see if you've got what it takes to save...A small part of the city.

﻿

Hello! I'm Poppy (he/him), and I've been playing in pbp games for about a year and a half. After trying my hand at running a few Masks games, I am now (shock horror) after having played in a few Sentinels Comics games, going to attempt a game where when the numbers determine how hard you hit someone.

This game will hopefully begin small scale. A group of plucky heroes coming together to protect a specific section of the city from villains. Think street level heroes fighting street level villains. Spider-Man, Daredevil, Hawkeye, take your pick. There will likely not be god-punching or many other awesome epic things, at least, not for the longest while, because what I really love is character and conflict.

To me, those two things are the beating heart of a pbp game. I want drama, I want conflict, I want to see people who will try their damn hardest to be good people in the face of adversity. I want people to work with me to create a story, rather than think I am some Magical Unimpeachable Storytelling Overlord.

So, what do I ask of you?

I need people to respect post length. If there’s a situation where someone asks a simple question, there doesn’t need to be multiple-post paragraphs. However that doesn’t meant that the twenty paragraph posts for when you defeat your evil Super-Dad aren’t needed. No, you simply respect the length, be it good or long. The quality matters over quantity.

There will be a requirement of a post a day, and usage of tupperbot is mandatory. Don't be put off by no knowledge of the system, newcomers are encouraged. I am looking for 5 players, and complicated characters are also a bonus, with messy complicated lives and wants for being a hero.

As a player, you must:

* Be able to post at least once a day, unless clearly communicating otherwise.
* Not give much of a crap about ‘winning’, but give a crap about telling a compelling, exciting story.
* Willing to play people with differing perspectives all in the name of drama: to understand you are not your character and will have differing viewpoints on the world
* Willing to take initiative, instead of waiting for commands from god.
* Willing to haggle and workshop if needed.
* Understanding of the fact, that the GM is another player, and has as much power as you.
* Willing to invest in other player's characters.
* Use Tupperbox. If you don't know what that is then-
* Willing to learn how to use Tupperbox.
* Understand rule of cool beats rule of nerds and fools

1ovzpg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1ovzpg0/whats_the_newest_portable_cooler_innovation/,What's the newest portable cooler innovation available?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been looking into portable coolers lately because summer's coming up and I'm tired of dealing with melted ice and soggy sandwiches. I wanted to share what I found because honestly, the technology has gotten pretty wild.

The biggest game-changer I've seen is electric portable coolers that actually refrigerate your stuff instead of just keeping ice around it. Yeah, I know regular coolers work fine, but hear me out.

These newer models don't need ice at all. They plug into your car's power outlet or even a portable battery pack. Some can keep your drinks cold for days, and the really cool ones can switch between cooling and heating. Imagine having hot coffee on a camping trip without building a fire.

I spent way too much time researching different brands and reading reviews. The technology is called thermoelectric cooling, which basically means it uses electricity to move heat away from your food and drinks. It's the same idea as your fridge at home, just smaller and portable.

What really sold me on upgrading from my old ice cooler was seeing how much space you save. No more buying bags of ice every day or dealing with water sloshing around at the bottom. Plus, you can actually control the exact temperature, which is perfect for keeping medications cool or making sure your beer is ice cold.

If you're in the market for one, I'd recommend checking out [this selection of portable coolers](https://athomewave.com/portable-cooler) to see what's available. The prices vary quite a bit depending on size and features, but there's something for every budget.

The main features to look for are battery life, cooling range (some go down to like 30 degrees below outside temperature), and size. Think about whether you need something for day trips or multi-day camping adventures.

One thing I didn't expect was how quiet these things are. My buddy has an older model that sounds like a tiny jet engine, but the newer ones barely make any noise. That matters a lot when you're trying to sleep in a tent.

The dual-zone models are pretty neat too. You can keep drinks cold in one section and food frozen in another. It's more expensive, but if you're doing serious outdoor activities or road trips, it might be worth it.

I ended up going with an electric model after comparing it to traditional coolers, and honestly, I wish I'd done it sooner. Yeah, it costs more upfront, but not having to constantly buy ice saves money over time.

You can find a solid variety of options [here](https://athomewave.com/portable-cooler) if you want to compare features and read actual customer reviews before deciding.

The bottom line is that portable cooler technology has seriously improved. Whether you're tailgating, camping, doing road trips, or just want cold drinks at the beach, these electric models are way more convenient than lugging around ice.

What's your experience with portable coolers? Are you still using the old-school ice method or have you switched to electric? Would love to hear what's worked for you.",1,1763036704.0,ProductAmazon,0,1.0,False

Cappuccino: market = 7, preference = 138

Macchiato: market = 5, preference = 12

Espresso: market = 0, preference = 55

  
Note: the market was calculated based od 71 products on the market and the preference was calculated based on 240 answers to the questionnare, where they could choose multiple answers (I'm not sure if this is relevant but just in case it is :))

ChatGPT told me to use **Chi-square analysis** and **standardised residuals**, but I am struggling to understand it based on the things I've read and I am not sure if it's the right way to do it, so I would really appreaciate a humans help! :))

* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
