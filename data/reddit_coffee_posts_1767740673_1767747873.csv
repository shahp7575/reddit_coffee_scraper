On multiple visits, I wasn’t acknowledged while others were. I’ve listened to staff talk and laugh with other customers, and when I tried to engage, it felt flat. I wasn’t expecting special treatment, just the basic courtesy anyone deserves.

When I raised this concern, I wasn’t questioning intent or character, I was just pointing out the impact. This response framed my experience as “internet discourse” rather than acknowledging it, which felt dismissive. Again. 

Impact matters, regardless of intent. That’s why I shared this. I promise I’m not looking to debate and won’t be engaging about it further.",1,1767747785.0,u_Healthy_Treat1915,0,1.0,False

1q613uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1q613uk/my_lc_journey/,My LC journey,"i am newer to the LC community - I am only 4 months in and I read posts and my heart goes out to those who have dealt with these side effects for years. but here is my story and what has helped me (bolded paragraph).

in september, i had a super crazy month. renovated my house, hosted family, 3 weddings (one of which i was maid of honor), working full time, and my husband and I operate our own creative business. that was normal energy output for me, always going going going. im 27F, and generally healthy - worked out consistently, not a perfect diet but a generally good diet of whole foods, etc. no major health markers.

at the end of the month the evening of the final wedding I was in, I realized i could not smell and that i had covid. i stayed to myself as much as possible, but i was exhausted. this was a saturday and for the next few days i just rested. i have been vaccinated, but also have had covid 3-4 times. so i knew the drill, rest... which i did. that next wednesday i felt good enough to go to the grocery, and run a few errands - grocery store being my last stop. in the store, i answered a phone call feeling completely normal and within 60 seconds i had lost my vision and was near syncope on the floor in kroger (never have fainted in my life). and that was the start. my vision kept coming/going, they called an ambulance and by the time they got to me my BP was 155/135, which is very high for me (normal to normal-low BP). i went to the ER and they brushed it off like a fluke. the next day i felt weird and not like myself but this thing has never happened to me so i chalked it up to that. i went to work and around 4pm i started feeling more like myself (which ended up becoming a trend - 4pm was my best hours), and went on a neighborhood walk with my husband. we get back in, make dinner, and i eat and i get another near syncope episode. the next day was friday and i felt the worst ive ever felt. my sister took me to urgent care and in there i had another near syncope episode and they sent me to the ER. in that ER was the first time POTS/long covid was ever mentioned to me. they did POTS tests but i didn't qualify, and since then my near syncope episodes have faded - they lasted about 3 weeks. I noticed they were exclusive to digestion for me. anytime i would eat too large a meal, within 30 minutes i was near syncope. for the first 2 weeks i was on a nearly liquid/soft diet and that helped while i slowly re-introduced solids.

over the course of 3 months i have been juggled back and forth between my PCP and a specialist for every side effect i name. no notable results. i wore a heart monitor for a week, nothing. multiple echos, CT scans, blood work, all showed nothing. after discovering reddit, i realized how soon on my journey I was, but that I aligned most with long covid symptoms. thank God in this time period i was quitting my job to work part time remote for another company. that has been my saving grace and was divine timing - I had to postpone my last day of work nearly 2 weeks because of my persistent symptoms until i had the energy to force myself there for the last day - i barely made it through.

over the 3 months I have experienced: fatigue, brain fog, chest pain, constipation, I could not burp unless i was completely upright (and sometimes not at all) - while producing a lot of gas which i think was the culprit of most of my chest pain... I was a pressure cooker of gas with no escape. i have experienced frequently and still experiencing these weird chest rushes - the best i saw it described was where it feels like your stomach dropping on a roller coaster but in your chest/throat area. sometimes a numbed sensation inside my throat like I am breathing but i can't feel the air being used, oxygen thirst but completely normal O2 levels, waking up every morning feeling like i have a hangover, voice exhaustion, short bursts of un explained tachycardia, and trouble focusing visually - watching TV HURT. another crazy symptom i had was a constant lump in my throat which never went away... i HATED it. intense gastroparesis and refluxing nearly everything including water, that is just what i remember off the top of my head with so much more i have journaled.

from my own research (not from a DR) i was experiencing potentially micro clotting, although my D dimer never showed blood clotting, my oxygen hunger was every day all day. potentially post nasal drip contributing to the lump in my throat, the constant brain fog, some vagus nerve malfunctions, etc.

heres what i take every day and have noticed a difference with - baby asprin and nattokinaise for the microclotting, a regimen of antihistamines to help with post nasal drip and any MCAS related symptoms since my episodes were around digestion mainly (quercetin & zyrtec), i take tumeric for anti inflammatory, coqu10, 2x fish oil by nordic naturals has made a huge difference in my brain fog, B complex, vitamin D, a multi vitamin and magnesium glycinate at night. i also nicotine patch. i do half of a 7mg and i do notice a difference. i don't sleep in it and i try to go 1 day a week not wearing it to avoid a dependence.

overall, im leaps and bounds better from where i was, but wow its scary. 27 and no health problems and then bam... im in the hospital 3 times, and going through this chronic illness spell immediately after having covid. i lost my dad and step mom both to cancer in 2024 and this sent me back into chronic grief feeling how they described to have felt to me in the past. the last 3 months have been as hard on me mentally as losing my parents was. i was very close to my dad and step mom - my dad was her caretaker and he quickly declined after she passed and I was his. so ive been through a lot as my step mom got cancer in 2011. as the oldest child i am the executor and have carried a heavy burden for years on behalf of my siblings and I and the stress ive felt and suppressed to merely function and do everything I had to do probably didn't help my journey - since losing them ive felt like a shell of myself and this illness took me back into those immediate moments.

heres what im still struggling with today: asthamatic symptoms (just had a PFT done and awaiting results), brain fog unless i take fish oil and the fatigue, but i prioritize rest over EVERYTHING, and the weird chest rush/chest drop most commonly at night when I lay down. also my period. my first period after getting sick took me back to point 0. i think my body had a stress response to that and i did not have another period for 55 days. i just ended my first period since the beginning of October.

everything else is manageable. my diet is ok...could be better. but its hard to cook good food when you don't feel your best. i love to sew, and sewing has been a hobby i can do. it doesnt take much physical effort and its something i can do all myself. i really want to begin to exercise again lightly but im scared. and im terrified for when i inevitably get covid again. I got strep the week before Christmas and it took everything out of me. I finally am seeing the progress I made come back after a long 3 weeks feeling defeated and back to square 1. it makes me sad how hard it is to find a doc who cares about and believes in LC. i saw someone say earlier they quit saying LC to doctors because of the eye roll, and i totally agree. I finally found an integrative doctor who didn’t virtually laugh at my symptoms. She listened to them all and had worked with LC before so I’m really grateful to have met her. I’m in Nashville - the provider is hopewell family. I get my bloodwork back next week and they’re going to do muscle testing on me to see if there are any toxins I’m holding on to. She mentioned EBV which I’ve had before and also Lymes as a possibility given I’m a native Tennessean and ticks are rampant here. 

i dont drink alcohol, i used to enjoy a glass of wine here and there but now i have a big aversion to it actually. minimal caffeine (1 cup of coffee). And I try to fast with a generally low histamine diet. I’m so grateful for my progress, and don't want to rub my short journey in anyones face. but i wanted to share the things that have helped me in case they can help someone else.",1,1767747754.0,covidlonghaulers,1,1.0,False

First-time visitor to Hanoi coming from Manila this February. I’m doing a short 3D2N trip and already booked my flights, tours, and an Airbnb in the Old Quarter. Please **check the attached screenshot** for my detailed day-by-day itinerary.​

**Questions about pacing:**

* For those familiar with Hanoi, is this too packed for 3D2N, or still manageable if I’m okay with long walking days?
* On the first day, is it realistic to explore, then do a food tour in the evening right after an early-morning flight, or should I slow it down more?

**Weather / clothing questions (late February):**

* For Ha Long Bay, are light layers (T-shirt + hoodie/jacket) enough on the boat, or does it feel much colder on the water and with the wind? Average February temps look around 15–20°C but I read it can feel chilly and foggy on the water.​
* What kind of shoes would you recommend for Hanoi walking + Ha Long cruise (comfortable sneakers vs sandals, etc.)?

**City tips:**

* Any must-try, still affordable local food spots or cafes in the Old Quarter that you’d recommend?
* Any common scams or tourist traps around the Old Quarter or Ha Long day tours I should watch out for?
* Any small tweaks you’d make to this itinerary to make it smoother or less tiring for a first-timer?

I’ll be using an eSIM for data the whole time—does coverage generally stay reliable in Hanoi and on the way to/from Ha Long Bay, or are there areas with notably weak signal that I should expect?

I’ve never asked anyone out or had any romantic feelings towards anyone before so this is all completely new to me

She’s very socially outgoing and I’m very introverted, and can’t tell if she’s ever been interested in me. She stands close to me when we’re in groups and she laughs a lot when I try to be funny, and we have a couple inside jokes. She also calls me by a nickname.

We’ve been for coffee a couple of times as friends and had long conversations. She’s opened up to me a lot about family, and especially about one of her recent breakups with someone I also know. She’s said she doesn’t want any more ‘boy problems’ because of that relationship a few of times, and went home once to distance herself emotionally from university

I’m really happy being friends with her if she says no if/when I ask her out, but I don’t want to betray that trust she has in me.

Hello Everyone! I need some advice about my future in college. I am a 21F, current junior, and a music performance major. I am studying to become a professional musician and aspire to join more symphony orchestras or ensembles.

Playing music has always been my passion. I started when I was 10 years old and stuck with it ever since. I understand some might say that this is just a hobby, but I can really see a future in this field; it's definitely something more than just a hobby or something I like to do for fun.

BUT here is where I am having a crisis :( I will put it into a list to easily understand. Sorry if it is a lot, I have so much on my mind.

* My school focuses more on music education majors. Music education majors are studying to become music educators! My school really pressures students into this field, telling us that no matter what, we will all be teaching. I even have to take a class next semester about coming up with lesson plans for when I teach students! This is something I do not want to do. But unfortunately, this school favors the education majors, and other majors don't exist.
* My private lesson teacher is cruel and irresponsible. I will refer to her as just teacher for now. I consider myself someone who can tackle anything. I'm a hard worker, I study a lot, and practice whenever I have time. Because of this, my tuition is all paid from scholarships, grants, and more! Some scholarships are even from my teacher! But lately, my teacher has been flat-out rude. Not strict, rude. They compare themself to me, embarrass me in front of my peers, make me cry after every lesson, miss more than half of our lessons, and more... I'm just sick of it, and I'm not the only one. They give the same treatment to other students as well. What's crazy is my teacher wasn't always this way! During my freshman and sophmore year, my teacher was very sweet, kind, and an amazing professor to study under! I learned a ton from them. But lately, I'm so sick of it. Why would I continue studying around someone I cannot learn from? Someone who fails to teach, come to class or lessons on time, and switches from being a sweet person to a horrible one the next day??
* I am failing one thing... To continue my studies as a music performance major, I have to pass the scales test. I already ""failed"" twice, which means I should have been kicked out of the music programme by now. But for some reason, my teacher wants me to stay and is keeping the fact that I failed off my record, so I can try again??? Very surprised considering their weird attitude towards me. SO to pass, I have to play any scale the judges ask for perfectly with little to no mistakes. I never had any lessons in the past, so playing scales is pretty new to me! The year I first failed the test was the year my teacher left for a couple of months to travel with their own orchestra. The second time was after a summer break... I spent most of my break working multiple jobs, living with someone who worked from home (via calls/computer), and with kids. I didn't have time or the luxury to practice my instrument all day everyday. It wasn't on my mind; what was on my mind was make enough money to pay my bills (car bills, insurance, etc). So I failed, of course. My third chance my teacher is giving me, is after my winter break.
* I am losing motivation. With multiple fails and a scary teacher, music in school has been really hard. Music majors in general are already hard enough, but this is something I don't think I am mentally strong enough to face. I love music, and I love to play for people; it makes me so happy. But it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. I know I only have a year and a half left, but it depends on if I even pass the scales test and keep going...
* I have a new goal in mind! Music isn't my only passion. I love art, coffee, and my culture. I won't give a lot of details because I want to keep my identity private. But I want to either switch to an entrepreneurship major or continue my music major and do an entrepreneurship minor. My goal is to open up a cafe with my favorite drinks, baked goods, and more. The drinks will have themes and cute aesthetics! The baked goods will be from my culture, and each month will feature a separate culture's pastries with fun facts. What I think will make this cafe even more special, and something I would be proud of running, is either an artist support corner, a K-pop corner, or stationary corner. This is a plan I would loveeeeee to study for.

So these are some of the bigger thoughts I have in mind when I am considering what I should do next...

\- Take a semester break to rethink?

\- Stay with this major and minor in entrepreneurship?

\- Quit music major, switch to a music minor, and an entrepreneurship major?

\- Any other options? Please help :( I feel like I am running out of time to choose my future while I still have college paid for and an almost finished degree!!!",1,1767746579.0,collegeadvice,0,1.0,False

I (27F) met a guy (29M) on Bumble about three weeks ago while I was home for winter break. We’re from the same general area, but I currently live seven hours away for grad school and plan to move back at the end of February. We talked for about a week, then went on our first date. He lives downtown and doesn’t have a car, while I was staying an hour and twenty minutes away at my parents’ place, so seeing each other wasn’t easy. I was already planning to visit friends, so we met for dinner and live music. Dinner was over $100, and I offered to split drinks after, which isn’t typical for either of our backgrounds. I liked him but didn’t feel a huge spark yet—good conversation, not much attraction. He initiated hand-holding and a quick kiss, then encouraged me to come back the following week and stay with my friend so we could spend more time together. I agreed because he seemed sweet and we connected conversationally.

Our second date lasted about nine hours, and that’s when I really started to like him. We had great chemistry and compatibility. We went to an art museum, got dinner, then coffee (which he asked if I could cover). He suggested dancing, but it was far, so instead we hung out at his place. I normally wouldn’t do that, but I was leaving for school soon and wanted to maximize our time. I told him upfront I didn’t want to have sex. We flirted a lot, he joked about meeting my parents, and he showed me my name saved as “crush” in his phone. We cuddled, watched a movie, talked, and he played piano for me, which was really beautiful and honestly made me feel like I could fall for him. We made out for a while, and it was great. I’m a virgin (he doesn’t know), and at one point I laughed because I was ticklish, but he thought it was because “he tried.” He begged me to stay over, and I wanted to, but I didn’t because the friend I was staying with is judgmental. I left that night feeling kind of freaked out by how much I liked him—it felt rare and genuine, and I couldn’t sleep because I was so excited about the potential.

The next day was New Year’s Eve, and he invited me to spend it with him and his close friends and stay over. I felt that was a big deal and a sign of real interest, but I didn’t want to abandon my friend who had just moved. He said I could just come by for a couple hours since he didn’t have the energy to go out before heading to his friend’s place. We hung out, listened to music, cuddled, and made out again. Conversation was more chill this day because we were both really sleep deprived (both have insomnia issues lol), so there were some silences...but I didn't find them awkward? Then, he needs to leave for his party with his friends. He tells me that he really enjoyed spending time with me and that we should keep in contact while I am back in the city I live in for grad school, and that he'll check in to see how my exams go. This was sweet and all, but it wasn't clear discussion of intentions. Like I said, I have met many men on dating apps, but have never felt a spark like I did with this guy. We may have only spent 20 hours together total, but I but I felt the beginning of a very beautiful, unique connection that could potentially become something great.

So, I texted him that night, and say I want to be direct because I was disappointed we didn't talk about it more. I enjoy spending time with you and would be open to getting to know each other more, while I am away for these two months. I'm moving back quite soon and intend to get a job right in the city center he lives in. He ends up, saying that he doesn't see it working out, and he thinks he is not feeling the connection, and that the distance is a bit of an issue too. This made me feel instantly so stupid and incapable of reading people well, something I usually pride myself in. I felt used. He knew I was looking for a long-term relationship, and he told me that he likes to go on fun dates with the hopes of finding his person, but that he wouldn't commit to anyone unless it was the right person. In my head that makes sense, and I feel the same; however, I guess that verbiage means something different when it comes from men, in hindsight. I just refused to believe that he didn't feel what I felt and I don't understand why he was the one to initiate all intimacy if he wasn't feeling the connection and knew what I was looking for. I also wonder how quickly he realized his feelings. Because why would we spend NYE together, cuddling, making out, and you suggesting I spend it with you and your friends and sleepover? If he felt this way after the second date, then he is an expert actor because he made me feel so desired. It just caught me off guard completely, and I feel that his actions and words do not align with that conclusion.

Now I’m left overanalyzing. I’m about to finish grad school and make six figures. He lost his well-paying government job earlier this year, has been struggling, working minimum wage at a coffee shop. He is very intelligent and went to a great program in his field of study. I know we has struggled with depressive feelings because of this. I wonder if money, confidence, or feeling intimidated played a role. I am not sure if him asking me to pay for coffee on the second date was because he is not truly interested or really just because of his difficult financial situation. Additionally, I don't smoke weed at all and I know he does one to two times a week to help compose music and just for fun. I purposefully asked him about the frequency and tried to do it in a nonjudgmental way, and he didn't seem phased by that question, but perhaps he felt judged in hindsight. (Please don't come for my neck about this, we are middle eastern and these are things we don't normally do). Maybe he’s just not in a place for a relationship, or maybe I came on too strong. Maybe it's dumb of me, but I can see his potential, intelligence, and ambition, and have no doubt that he can find another good job soon, which is why I was willing to work with him. Am I being dumb? Too naive and hopeful? Don't worry, I intend to keep NC, but it really sucks that I can't stop thinking about him. I promise you I am not normally a simp..I actually don't care when other matches haven't worked out because they didn't excite me in any real way. But something about him felt so real and full of possibility, so it really hurt to have the rug ripped from under me. I don't feel like he was genuine in what he is looking for, but maybe it was something that he realized too late. Regardless, it leaves me wondering what is wrong with me and if it's just bc he realized I wasn't pretty or interesting enough :(",1,1767746508.0,Bumble,1,0.67,False

""Okay, we have 8, 12, or 16 oz.""

I really don't get it. Do most coffee places only have one size of mug? I feel like surely that can't be the case.

What really annoys me is the way they treat me. They start looking at me like I have three heads. They start speaking slowly and rudely like I must be incapable of processing words.

I get not realizing it the first time, but when I keep prompting you to tell me the size, surely you should realize that I can do any size in a mug? And why do they have to get so rude about it? If it were me and I was confused I'd just go ""oh do you have all the sizes in mug form?"" and it would be cleared up quickly and politely.",4,1767746493.0,barista,7,0.7,False

I have formed pretty much zero close relationships with any professors throughout university. Not trying to make excuses but I went to cc for 2 years and transferred to uni last year. I graduate this March (I just started my last quarter of uni today) and I'm going to apply to med school in 2027.

I know for one of my letters I'll have my PI from the lab i volunteer at write it. For the others though? No clue! I've been telling myself I'll find a doctor to shadow/work for once I graduate, who I'd hope would write one of the letters for me. However, I'm stressed about the fact that I have zero professors I'd feel close enough to ask to write me a LOR.

My uni classes are huge and professors will have 20 kids show up to their office hours. It feels difficult to find a stem professor I could form a close relationship with... here's what i have to work with, though:

1. my biomedical ethics professor this quarter: the class is about 60 people I assume and I do have an interest in philosophy, so I could see myself attending all of his office hours to form a relationship with him
2. my neuroscience professor from last quarter: the thing with her is that she's busy; I only started speaking to her toward the end of the last quarter and I'd skip her lectures a lot, but my lab is doing neuroscience related work, which I've spoken to her about. I'm also very interested in neuroscience, but I don't see how I could form a bond with her, unless I pester her to do 1-on-1 brief coffee meetings with me to discuss neuroscience-related things.
3. my biochemistry professor from 2 quarters ago: she's sweet but very to-the-point. I worked in her plant lab for like 3 months before I switched over unexpectedly (which I feel bad about). If I were to meet with her, I'm not even sure what I'd speak to her about?
4. My current cell biology professor: biggest issue is that he does office hours online only, which I fear would be harder to attempt at a relationship when we could only meet one-on-one in zoom?

I've thought about asking one of my stem professors if I could volunteer as a reader/TA for their class once I graduate, but I don't know if there are any limitations to that as I won't be a student anymore next quarter / if that's even allowed. WHAT DO I DO???!!!",2,1767746254.0,UCSD,0,1.0,False
1q60ido,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1q60ido/how_to_crush_any_interview_the_sciencebased/,How to CRUSH Any Interview: The Science-Based Playbook That Actually Works,"Most people think they bombed interviews because they weren't ""qualified enough"" or didn't have the right answers memorized. That's BS. I've spent months researching this, diving into books by HR executives, listening to podcasts with Fortune 500 recruiters, watching countless YouTube breakdowns of successful interviews. The real issue? Most of us are fighting against our own biology and completely misunderstanding what interviewers actually want.

Here's what nobody tells you: interviews aren't really about your qualifications. Your resume already got you in the door. The interview is about whether they can stand being around you for 40+ hours a week. Sounds harsh, but that's the game.

**The 48 hour pre game ritual matters more than you think.** Research from organizational psychologist Adam Grant shows that confidence is actually a skill you can manufacture through preparation, not some innate trait. Two days before, start visualizing yourself in that room, answering questions smoothly, making the interviewer laugh. Sounds woo woo but your brain doesn't distinguish between vividly imagined experiences and real ones. You're literally rewiring your neural pathways to be comfortable in that scenario.

**Stop trying to seem perfect, start being memorable.** The book ""You're Not Listening"" by Kate Murphy destroyed my assumptions about communication. She's a journalist who spent years studying human connection, and her main thesis is wild: people don't remember what you say, they remember how the conversation felt. If you're robotically reciting rehearsed answers, you're already losing. Throw in a brief self deprecating joke. Admit when you don't know something but show curiosity. Let them see you're an actual human. One guy I know got hired after admitting he once accidentally emailed a client a meme instead of a proposal. Made him unforgettable.

**Master the STAR method but make it conversational.** Situation, Task, Action, Result. Boring as hell when delivered like a police report. Instead, tell it like you're explaining to a friend over coffee. ""So there was this clusterfuck of a project where literally everything went wrong."" Then walk through how you handled it. The podcast ""How I Built This"" with Guy Raz is phenomenal for this. He interviews founders who've mastered storytelling about challenges, and you can steal their frameworks. They make failures sound like plot twists, not disasters.

**BeFreed is an AI personalized learning app** built by Columbia University alumni and former Google experts that turns book summaries, expert talks, and research papers into custom podcasts tailored to your goals. For interview prep specifically, you can ask it to pull insights from communication psychology, negotiation tactics, and body language research, then it generates an adaptive learning plan based on your needs.

What makes it useful here is the depth control. Start with a quick 10 minute overview of interview frameworks, and if something clicks, switch to the 40 minute deep dive packed with real examples and context. The voice options are wildly addictive too, you can pick anything from a calm, analytical tone to something more energetic that keeps you focused during your commute. Plus there's this virtual coach called Freedia that you can pause mid podcast to ask follow up questions or get clarification on specific tactics. Makes absorbing all this research way less overwhelming when you can customize exactly how you want to learn it.

**Ask questions that make them think.** Everyone asks ""what's the culture like"" and gets the same sanitized answer. Try this instead: ""What's the biggest challenge facing your team right now that you're hoping this role will help solve?"" Suddenly you're having a real conversation. Or ""What does success look like in this role after six months?"" Shows you're already thinking like an employee. I pulled this from ""Never Split the Difference"" by Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator. His stuff on tactical empathy and calibrated questions is a total game changer for interviews. The guy literally negotiated with terrorists and now teaches you how to negotiate your career.

**Your body language is screaming things you don't realize.** Social psychologist Amy Cuddy's research on power poses is legit. Before the interview, find a bathroom, stand like Wonder Woman for two minutes. Hands on hips, chest out, feet wide. Legitimately changes your testosterone and cortisol levels. Sounds ridiculous but it works. During the interview, mirror their body language subtly. They lean forward, you lean forward. Creates subconscious rapport.

**The thank you email is your second interview.** Send it within 3 hours while you're still fresh in their mind. Don't just say thanks, reference something specific from your conversation. ""I loved hearing about the project you mentioned with the client in Tokyo, that approach to problem solving really resonates with my experience at X."" Shows you were actually listening and can recall details under pressure.

The truth is, most people fail interviews because they're performing instead of connecting. They're so terrified of saying the wrong thing that they forget to be likable. Competence gets you considered, but personality gets you hired. The system isn't designed to find the most qualified person, it's designed to find someone qualified enough that they want to work with.

These aren't just tricks, they're frameworks for showing up as your best self when it matters most. The research backs it up, the experts confirm it, and once you internalize these, interviews stop feeling like interrogations and start feeling like conversations about your future.",1,1767746252.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False

I need some advice about my future in college. I am a 21F, current junior, and a music performance major. I am studying to become a professional musician and aspire to join more symphony orchestras or ensembles. 

Playing music has always been my passion. I started when I was 10 years old and stuck with it ever since.  I understand some might say that this is just a hobby, but I can really see a future in this field; it's definitely something more than just a hobby or something I like to do for fun. 

BUT here is where I am having a crisis :( I will put it into a list to easily understand. Sorry if it is a lot, I have so much on my mind.

* My school focuses more on music education majors. Music education majors are studying to become music educators! My school really pressures students into this field, telling us that no matter what, we will all be teaching. I even have to take a class next semester about coming up with lesson plans for when I teach students! This is something I do not want to do. But unfortunately, this school favors the education majors, and other majors don't exist. 
* My private lesson teacher is cruel and irresponsible. I will refer to her as just teacher for now. I consider myself someone who can tackle anything. I'm a hard worker, I study a lot, and practice whenever I have time. Because of this, my tuition is all paid from scholarships, grants, and more! Some scholarships are even from my teacher! But lately, my teacher has been flat-out rude. Not strict, rude. They compare themself to me, embarrass me in front of my peers, make me cry after every lesson,  miss more than half of our lessons, and more... I'm just sick of it, and I'm not the only one. They give the same treatment to other students as well.  What's crazy is my teacher wasn't always this way! During my freshman and sophmore year, my teacher was very sweet, kind, and an amazing professor to study under! I learned a ton from them. But lately, I'm so sick of it. Why would I continue studying around someone I cannot learn from? Someone who fails to teach, come to class or lessons on time, and switches from being a sweet person to a horrible one the next day?? 
* I am failing one thing... To continue my studies as a music performance major, I have to pass the scales test. I already ""failed"" twice, which means I should have been kicked out of the music programme by now. But for some reason, my teacher wants me to stay and is keeping the fact that I failed off my record, so I can try again??? Very surprised considering their weird attitude towards me. SO to pass, I have to play any scale the judges ask for perfectly with little to no mistakes. I never had any lessons in the past, so playing scales is pretty new to me! The year I first failed the test was the year my teacher left for a couple of months to travel with their own orchestra. The second time was after a summer break... I spent most of my break working multiple jobs, living with someone who worked from home (via calls/computer), and with kids. I didn't have time or the luxury to practice my instrument all day everyday. It wasn't on my mind; what was on my mind was make enough money to pay my bills (car bills, insurance, etc). So I failed, of course. My third chance my teacher is giving me, is after my winter break. 
* I am losing motivation. With multiple fails and a scary teacher, music in school has been really hard. Music majors in general are already hard enough, but this is something I don't think I am mentally strong enough to face. I love music, and I love to play for people; it makes me so happy. But it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. I know I only have a year and a half left, but it depends on if I even pass the scales test and keep going... 
* I have a new goal in mind! Music isn't my only passion. I love art, coffee, and my culture. I won't give a lot of details because I want to keep my identity private. But I want to either switch to an entrepreneurship major or continue my music major and do an entrepreneurship minor. My goal is to open up a cafe with my favorite drinks, baked goods, and more. The drinks will have themes and cute aesthetics! The baked goods will be from my culture, and each month will feature a separate culture's pastries with fun facts. What I think will make this cafe even more special, and something I would be proud of running, is either an artist support corner, a K-pop corner, or stationary corner. This is a plan I would loveeeeee to study for.

  
So these are some of the bigger thoughts I have in mind when I am considering what I should do next... 

\- Take a semester break to rethink?

\- Stay with this major and minor in entrepreneurship? 

\- Quit music major, switch to a music minor, and an entrepreneurship major?

\- Any other options? Please help :( I feel like I am running out of time to choose my future while I still have college paid for and an almost finished degree!!!

I have formed pretty much zero close relationships with any professors throughout university. Not trying to make excuses but I went to cc for 2 years and transferred to uni last year. I graduate this March (I just started my last quarter of uni today) and I'm going to apply to med school in 2027.

  
I know for one of my letters I'll have my PI from the lab i volunteer at write it. For the others though? No clue! I've been telling myself I'll find a doctor to shadow/work for once I graduate, who I'd hope would write one of the letters for me. However, I'm stressed about the fact that I have zero professors I'd feel close enough to ask to write me a LOR.

  
My uni classes are huge and professors will have 20 kids show up to their office hours. It feels difficult to find a stem professor I could form a close relationship with... here's what i have to work with, though:

  
1) my biomedical ethics professor this quarter: the class is about 60 people I assume and I do have an interest in philosophy, so I could see myself attending all of his office hours to form a relationship with him

  
2) my neuroscience professor from last quarter: the thing with her is that she's busy; I only started speaking to her toward the end of the last quarter and I'd skip her lectures a lot, but my lab is doing neuroscience related work, which I've spoken to her about. I'm also very interested in neuroscience, but I don't see how I could form a bond with her, unless I pester her to do 1-on-1 brief coffee meetings with me to discuss neuroscience-related things.

3) my biochemistry professor from 2 quarters ago: she's sweet but very to-the-point. I worked in her plant lab for like 3 months before I switched over unexpectedly (which I feel bad about). If I were to meet with her, I'm not even sure what I'd speak to her about?

4) My current cell biology professor: biggest issue is that he does office hours online only, which I fear would be harder to attempt at a relationship when we could only meet one-on-one in zoom?

I've thought about asking one of my stem professors if I could volunteer as a reader/TA for their class once I graduate, but I don't know if there are any limitations to that as I won't be a student anymore next quarter / if that's even allowed. WHAT DO I DO???!!!",1,1767746091.0,premed,0,1.0,False
1q60eki,https://www.reddit.com/r/betterbioeconomy/comments/1q60eki/lessons_from_one_of_food_techs_most_active/,Lessons from one of food tech’s most active investors 💬,"For Issue #129 of Better Bioeconomy, I spoke with Andrew D Ive (Founder and Managing General Partner, Big Idea Ventures), one of the most active investors in food tech with 150+ portfolio companies across 30 countries.  
  
5 takeaways that stood out:  
  
1. Time with founders is the real diligence.  
BIV spends \~20 weeks with teams. You learn more from how founders handle pilots, pushback, and ambiguity than from polished boardroom answers.  
  
2. Many startup failures are human.  
A lot of companies don’t die because the science “didn’t work.” They stall when co-founder dynamics crack, decision-making breaks down, or the team can’t stay aligned under pressure.  
  
3. Alt protein is on three different timelines.  
Plant-based needs better products (ingredients, formulation, process, repeatable eating experiences), not flashier marketing. Fermentation and cultivated have answered “can it work?” and now face the harder question: cost, scale, and a patchwork of regulation.  
  
4. Scaling happens when startups, corporates, and governments work together.  
Startups take early technical and market risk. Corporates industrialise, distribute, and sell. Governments shape the enabling environment (policy, approvals, infrastructure). When these pieces align, innovation scales.  
  
5. The next chapter is about building blocks.  
More attention is shifting to ingredients (fats, flavours, sweeteners, cocoa/coffee), biotech-enabled upcycling with clearer functional outputs, faster bacterial platforms, better strain discovery tools, and tighter university-to-startup pipelines.

* Klinefelter Syndrome, zero natural testosterone production, medicated with 20.25mg Androgel per day, prior to that was on 100mg/week IM injections for eight years
* Hypertension, medicated with 2.5mg amlodipine per day (122/78 on amlodipine, around 130/86 when not medicated)
* clinically low Vitamin D, medicated with (prescribed) 4000iu Vitamin D per day
* high cholesterol, not high enough for statins but they're going to check back with me in a year, I've been taking fish oil for this (not prescribed) and reducing dietary fat
* moderate to severe sleep apnea, medicated with APAP machine nightly
* secondary polycythemia, presumably due to TRT and sleep apnea, medicated with phlebotomy 4x per year
  
For reference, I have secondary polycythemia so I'm required to get phlebotomy every few months, but recently I've been trying to address the triggers for that (APAP for sleep apnea, switching to testosterone gel instead of IM injections, getting better sleep, fixing my low vitamin D, etc).

* RBC: high, depends on where I am in my phlebotomy cycle

My GP said my iron is normal and I shouldn't be supplementing because 62 is a good number. I guess I'm looking for a second look; I feel beyond tired, like 'having trouble driving a car' tired.

**A Play in Eight Scenes**

*A dark satire about institutional courtesy as a social anesthetic*



# SCENE 1 – THE POLICE ENCOUNTER

*A gray January street in Toronto. Slush piled against storefronts. Fluorescent light from a 7-Eleven bleeds onto the sidewalk. CITIZEN stands under a bus shelter. OFFICER approaches, tablet glowing.*

**CITIZEN**: Excuse me, officer? I need to report something.

**OFFICER**: *(friendly, practiced)* Of course. What seems to be the trouble?

**CITIZEN**: The government's torturing people.

*Beat. OFFICER taps his tablet, scrolls.*

**OFFICER**: *(nodding)* Ah. We prefer to call it ""policy alignment.""

*Silence. Wind. A Tim Hortons cup rolls by.*

**CITIZEN**: So... that's a yes?

**OFFICER**: Sir, I'm going to need you to calm down and file that concern with the Ministry of Empathy. *(He produces a brochure from his vest, hands it over. It's printed in Comic Sans.)* They're very responsive. The average wait time is only fourteen months.

**CITIZEN**: *(reading)* ""Your Suffering Matters: A Guide to Appropriate Grievance Expression.""

**OFFICER**: That's the one. Have a great day now. *(tips his cap, walks away)*

**CITIZEN**: *(to audience)* He was very polite about it.

*Lights fade.*



# SCENE 2 – THE CLINIC

*White walls. Posters about prevention. The smell of hand sanitizer and resignation. DOCTOR sits, keyboard between them like a shield. PATIENT enters.*

**DOCTOR**: So. What brings you in today?

**PATIENT**: The medication you prescribed. It's killing me.

**DOCTOR**: Mmm. That's unusual.

**PATIENT**: I know. I'm the only one living in my body.

*Typing. No eye contact.*

**DOCTOR**: Have you been anxious?

**PATIENT**: Only when poisoned.

**DOCTOR**: We'll keep monitoring. Any other concerns?

**PATIENT**: There's lead in the water. I had it tested.

**DOCTOR**: *(finally looks up)* Lead?

**PATIENT**: From the pipes. The building's old. The landlord won't—

**DOCTOR**: Have you considered that stress might be amplifying your perception of symptoms?

**PATIENT**: I have a lab report.

**DOCTOR**: Right. But how are you *feeling* about the lab report?

*Pause.*

**PATIENT**: Concerned. Because lead causes neurological damage.

**DOCTOR**: *(back to typing)* I'm going to note heightened anxiety and preoccupation with environmental factors.

**PATIENT**: That's called rational self-preservation.

**DOCTOR**: *(standing)* Let's try increasing the dosage and see where we are in six weeks.

**PATIENT**: The dosage of what's making me sick?

**DOCTOR**: *(opens door)* Healing isn't always comfortable. Take care now.

*Door closes. PATIENT stands alone.*

**PATIENT**: *(to audience)* She had excellent listening skills.

*Lights fade.*



# SCENE 3 – THE PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE

*Diplomas stacked like Pokémon cards. Leather chair. A clock that ticks too loud. A fern that died quietly in 2017. PSYCHIATRIST behind desk. PATIENT sits across.*

**PSYCHIATRIST**: So. How are we feeling today.

**PATIENT**: I'm tired. My body hurts. I can't think straight.

**PSYCHIATRIST**: Mmm. Tired how.

**PATIENT**: Drug tired. Cement tired. Like my brain is wrapped in wool.

*Nod. Notes. No eye contact.*

**PSYCHIATRIST**: Any unusual beliefs.

**PATIENT**: Depends who you ask.

*Smile. Thin one.*

**PSYCHIATRIST**: Do you think the government is harming you.

**PATIENT**: I think the medication is harming me.

*Pause. Longer notes now.*

**PSYCHIATRIST**: Insight appears limited.

**PATIENT**: I just described cause and effect.

**PSYCHIATRIST**: That can feel very real to patients.

**PATIENT**: It *is* real. I take the pill, I can't move for six hours.

**PSYCHIATRIST**: Correlation isn't causation.

**PATIENT**: But discomfort is data when it's happening inside the body.

*Smile again. Reassuring. Dead.*

**PSYCHIATRIST**: I hear your distress.

**PATIENT**: No you hear words. You filter out meaning.

*Clock ticks. Louder now.*

**PSYCHIATRIST**: I think what we're seeing is a resurgence.

**PATIENT**: Of what.

**PSYCHIATRIST**: Your condition.

**PATIENT**: Which one. You've given me three.

*Chair creaks. Glasses adjusted.*

**PSYCHIATRIST**: Labels aren't important. Stability is.

**PATIENT**: Then why do the labels decide what you inject into me.

*Silence. The clock wins.*

**PSYCHIATRIST**: We're going to increase the dose.

**PATIENT**: That's what caused this.

**PSYCHIATRIST**: *(writing)* Any thoughts of refusing treatment.

**PATIENT**: Only rational ones.

*Pen stops.*

**PSYCHIATRIST**: We'll schedule a follow-up.

**PATIENT**: Of course you will.

*Door opens. Hallway smells like disinfectant and surrender.*

*Lights fade.*



# SCENE 4 – THE MOTHER

*A living room. Too warm. MOTHER sits in armchair, phone in hand. PATIENT stands by door, duffel bag at feet.*

**PATIENT**: I can't stay at the apartment anymore. The mold is—

**MOTHER**: Mold? Again with the mold?

**PATIENT**: It's in the bathroom. The bedroom. I wake up and I can't breathe.

**MOTHER**: You're always exaggerating.

**PATIENT**: I have photos.

**MOTHER**: Photos don't mean anything. You probably caused it.

**PATIENT**: How do you cause mold?

**MOTHER**: By opening windows. By breathing too much. By complaining to the landlord.

**PATIENT**: He won't fix anything. There's lead in the water too.

**MOTHER**: *(sharper now)* Lead? Now it's lead? What's next, asbestos?

**PATIENT**: Actually—

**MOTHER**: You're harassing that poor man. He's doing his best.

**PATIENT**: His best is illegal.

**MOTHER**: This is why no one wants to rent to you. You cause trouble.

*Pause.*

**PATIENT**: I just asked him to fix the pipe.

**MOTHER**: You *demanded*. You were rude.

**PATIENT**: I was firm.

**MOTHER**: Same thing. *(stands, crosses arms)* You know what your problem is? You don't know how to get along with people.

**PATIENT**: Or maybe people don't know how to not poison me.

**MOTHER**: There you go again. Drama. Always drama. No wonder you're on so many pills.

*Beat. PATIENT picks up bag.*

**PATIENT**: I need somewhere to stay. Just for a few weeks.

**MOTHER**: I don't have room.

**PATIENT**: You have a couch.

**MOTHER**: I need my space. Have you tried a shelter?

**PATIENT**: It's full. And there's open drug use. People screaming at night.

**MOTHER**: Well. *(sits back down)* Maybe you should've thought about that before you upset your landlord.

*PATIENT stares. Says nothing. Turns. Leaves.*

**MOTHER**: *(calling after)* And don't come crying to me when you have nowhere to go!

*Door closes. She picks up her phone. Scrolls.*

*Lights fade.*



# SCENE 5 – THE COMMUNITY CENTER

*A basement room. Folding tables. Donated coffee in Styrofoam cups. Inspirational quotes on walls about resilience. A small group sits in a circle. PATIENT enters, hesitant.*

**FACILITATOR**: Come in, come in! We're just getting started.

**PATIENT**: *(sits)* Thanks. Sorry I'm late.

**FACILITATOR**: No apologies needed here. This is a safe space.

*PATIENT nods. Waits.*

**FACILITATOR**: So! Does anyone have anything they'd like to share today?

*PATIENT raises hand slightly.*

**FACILITATOR**: Yes?

**PATIENT**: I'm in a bad situation. My apartment has mold. Black mold. And lead in the water. I'm sick all the time and I have nowhere to go. Does anyone know of a place? Even temporary?

*Silence. People look at coffee cups.*

**PERSON 1**: *(sympathetic)* Oh no. That's awful.

**PERSON 2**: Have you tried the shelter on Queen Street?

**PATIENT**: It's mostly full. And it seems... unsafe.

**PERSON 3**: What about staying with family?

**PATIENT**: Not an option.

*More silence.*

**FACILITATOR**: Well. We'll keep you in our thoughts.

**PATIENT**: I'm also working on a project—a contract—but they're withholding payment. I asked for an advance because of the housing situation and they said no. Then they broke the contract. Twice. And now they're calling my attempts to get paid ""harassment.""

**PERSON 1**: Oh that's... that's complicated.

**FACILITATOR**: Have you tried speaking calmly with them?

**PATIENT**: I did. They stole some of my work.

**PERSON 2**: *(uncomfortable)* Maybe there's been a misunderstanding.

**PATIENT**: It's in writing. The terms. The breach. Everything.

**FACILITATOR**: Well, we can't really get involved in... disputes. But we can offer emotional support.

**PATIENT**: I need a place to sleep.

**FACILITATOR**: Of course. Of course. *(pause)* Have you tried journaling about your feelings?

*PATIENT stares.*

**PERSON 3**: We could do a healing circle for you.

**PATIENT**: A... what?

**PERSON 3**: We hold hands and send positive energy.

**PATIENT**: I need walls and a roof.

**FACILITATOR**: *(gently)* I hear that you're in pain. And we want to honor that pain.

**PATIENT**: Can you honor it with a couch?

*Uncomfortable shifting.*

**FACILITATOR**: Unfortunately our space isn't equipped for overnight stays. But I can give you some pamphlets.

*Produces pamphlets. Hands them over.*

**PATIENT**: *(reading)* ""Finding Peace in Precarity: A Self-Care Guide.""

**FACILITATOR**: It's very empowering.

*PATIENT stands. Leaves pamphlets on chair. Walks out.*

**PERSON 1**: *(whispering)* Poor thing.

**PERSON 2**: Should we have—

**FACILITATOR**: We did what we could. Now. Who wants to talk about gratitude practices?

*Lights fade.*



# SCENE 6 – THE SYNAGOGUE OFFICE

*Small room. Desk cluttered with papers. Judaica on shelves. RABBI sits, black hat, beard. PATIENT stands.*

**RABBI**: So you need tzedakah.

**PATIENT**: I need what I'm owed. We had a contract.

**RABBI**: A contract, yes. But things change.

**PATIENT**: They changed after I did the work.

**RABBI**: These situations are delicate.

**PATIENT**: The terms were clear. I delivered. They didn't pay.

**RABBI**: *(sighs)* You asked for an advance.

**PATIENT**: Because I'm being poisoned by mold and I have nowhere to live.

**RABBI**: That's not the organization's responsibility.

**PATIENT**: Paying for completed work is.

**RABBI**: You also got... emotional. The project head mentioned you were rude.

**PATIENT**: I was frustrated. I apologized immediately.

**RABBI**: Apologies don't undo the disrespect.

**PATIENT**: But theft is fine?

*Pause. RABBI leans back.*

**RABBI**: You're upset. I understand. But calling it theft—that's a strong word.

**PATIENT**: They used my work. Without payment. What do you call it?

**RABBI**: A misunderstanding.

**PATIENT**: It's in the contract.

**RABBI**: Contracts can be interpreted many ways.

**PATIENT**: Not when they're in English.

*RABBI stands. Walks to window.*

**RABBI**: You know, there's a teaching. About humility. About not being so... insistent.

**PATIENT**: There's also a teaching about not stealing.

**RABBI**: *(turns)* You're making this very difficult.

**PATIENT**: I'm asking to be paid.

**RABBI**: And I'm telling you: the community has decided to offer tzedakah instead. As a kindness.

**PATIENT**: I don't want charity. I want what I earned.

**RABBI**: Then you're being prideful.

*Beat.*

**PATIENT**: You're really doing this.

**RABBI**: I'm trying to help you.

**PATIENT**: By enabling theft?

**RABBI**: *(harder now)* By teaching you how to behave in a community. You don't make demands. You don't accuse. You accept what's offered with grace.

**PATIENT**: Even when it's wrong?

**RABBI**: *Especially* when it's wrong. That's faith.

*PATIENT stares. Long moment.*

**PATIENT**: I met the other rabbi. The older one.

**RABBI**: Reb Hirsch?

**PATIENT**: Yeah. Weak handshake.

*RABBI's expression darkens.*

**RABBI**: Excuse me?

**PATIENT**: I'm just saying. For a spiritual leader—

**RABBI**: *(steps closer)* You need to watch your mouth.

**PATIENT**: I'm noticing patterns of avoidance of—

**RABBI**: I'm not asking.

*They lock eyes. Long beat. RABBI doesn't move. Finally, PATIENT backs toward door.*

**PATIENT**: So. No payment.

**RABBI**: We'll send you something small. Out of compassion.

**PATIENT**: For work I completed.

**RABBI**: For your situation.

**PATIENT**: And if I keep asking?

**RABBI**: Then you're harassing us. And we'll have to take measures.

*PATIENT opens door. Stops.*

**PATIENT**: You know what the funny thing is?

**RABBI**: What.

**PATIENT**: I thought community meant something.

**RABBI**: It does. When you respect it.

*PATIENT leaves. Door closes. RABBI returns to desk. Picks up phone.*

# SCENE 7 – THE POLITE CITIZENS

*A subway platform. Morning rush. COMMUTERS stand in neat lines, staring at phones. Two CITIZENS speak in hushed tones.*

**CITIZEN A**: *(whispering)* Rent's double what it was last year.

**CITIZEN B**: *(whispering back)* I know. I'm sleeping in my car.

**CITIZEN A**: That's awful.

**CITIZEN B**: Yes, but we mustn't complain. That would be rude.

**CITIZEN A**: Of course. Of course.

*A MAN in a suit collapses. Thud. No one screams.*

**COMMUTER 1**: *(stepping over him gently)* Sorry!

**COMMUTER 2**: *(also stepping over)* So sorry!

**COMMUTER 3**: *(pausing, leaning down slightly)* Are you okay? *(doesn't wait for answer, continues walking)* Sorry!

*The MAN lies still. Train arrives. Everyone boards. Doors close.*

**CITIZEN A**: *(to CITIZEN B as they board)* Do you think we should have—

**CITIZEN B**: Shh. He wouldn't want to make a scene.

*Train pulls away. Man still on platform.*



*Same platform. Later. PATIENT enters, sits on bench. Looks at phone. Texts visible projected behind:*

**""Still no payment.""**  
**""Mom won't let me stay.""**  
**""Shelter full.""**  
**""Mold worse.""**

*PATIENT puts phone down. Stares at tracks.*

**VOICE OVER PA**: The next train is arriving. Please stand behind the yellow line.

*PATIENT stands. Walks to edge. Looks down.*

**COMMUTER 4**: *(nearby, noticing)* You okay there?

**PATIENT**: *(looks up)* What?

**COMMUTER 4**: You just... you look upset.

**PATIENT**: I'm fine.

**COMMUTER 4**: Okay. Just... you know. *(gestures vaguely at crisis line poster)* Resources. If you need.

**PATIENT**: I need a place to live.

**COMMUTER 4**: Right. *(uncomfortable)* Well. Good luck with that.

*Train arrives. Doors open. COMMUTER 4 boards. PATIENT stays on platform.*

*Doors close. Train leaves. PATIENT sits back down.*

**PATIENT**: *(to audience)* They were very concerned.

*Lights fade.*



# SCENE 8 – CLOSING MONOLOGUE

*Empty stage. Single spotlight. PATIENT stands center.*

**PATIENT**: We call this civility.

*Pause.*

A nation of quiet sufferers,  
humming apologies in perfect harmony,  
while the walls drip with antidepressants and lead.

*Beat.*

We've mastered the art of the polite collapse.  
The sorry suicide.  
The please-and-thank-you breakdown.

*Pause. Looks at audience.*

You can die here, you know.  
But you'll do it with a smile,  
and you'll apologize for the inconvenience.

*Beat.*

Your mother will say you should've tried harder.  
Your doctor will increase the dosage.  
Your psychiatrist will note ""poor insight.""  
Your community will offer thoughts and prayers.  
Your landlord will keep your damage deposit.

*Lights begin to flicker.*

And everyone—  
*everyone*—  
will tell you how concerned they are.

*Pause.*

We don't riot.  
We don't revolt.  
We just...

*Gesture: small, defeated shrug.*

...fill out the form.  
Wait fourteen months.  
And hope we're still alive to receive the response.

*Lights flicker faster.*

But at least we're nice about it.

At least we didn't make a scene.

At least we remembered to say sorry

before the mold filled our lungs,

before the lead dulled our minds,

before the medications made us forget

what it felt like

to be

awake.

*One final flicker. Blackout. In darkness:*

**PATIENT**: *(voice only)* Welcome to the polite matrix.

*Long silence. Then, softly:*

**PATIENT**: Please mind the gap.

*End.*



**CURTAIN**

1q60a9m,https://v.redd.it/3vjg354yktbg1,"[Beta] Feedback wanted: Trove File Explorer, a fast & efficient file manager for Windows-switchers and people who don't love Finder","Hello community,



**""Ugh... another** F**inder replacement?"" - Yes! But this one's different ;)**



When I got my first MacBook from my workplace, like many people coming from Windows/Linux, the thing I struggled the most with were Finder and the unfamiliar workflows and keyboard shortcuts - and to be honest, after years of daily driving macOS, which I otherwise love, I still find myself firing up a ThinkPad sometimes to sift and sort through my external HDD.



Finally, when my wife, who has only ever used Windows, borrowed my MBP last fall to work on some files on a USB drive and got really frustrated, I remembered that I am a software dev by trade and a plan emerged. Fast forward to today, and I am happy to announce that my file manager ""Trove File Explorer"", which is specifically designed meet the requirements of Windows-switchers and people who never loved Finder, is now available for beta testing and will also hit the App Store soon.



While of course I know there are quite a few alternatives out there already, I found that many of them have pretty crowded interfaces and are often geared towards a more tech-savvy ""poweruser"" audience.



Trove has a minimalistic tabbed, split-window, recursive tree-view UI with navigation buttons and a search field. All the Windows Explorer shortcuts like Cmd+X/V to cut-and-paste, Cmd+ArrowKey to navigate and right-click drag&drop (which I emulate through holding the Option⌥-key while dragging) to get a ""Move here / copy here / Abort"" dialog are there. You can view your files in either grid or detailed list view. I wrote this app in native SwiftUI and from my own testing, its performance is on par with Apple's Finder when browsing your local drive, external media and network shares. Trove is meant for casual users, Windows-switchers and people who just want to get their file management down without re-wiring their muscle memory for Finder.



Some key features:

* Tabbed interface with recursive sidebar navigation and favorites
* QuickView previews and configurable thumbnails
* Folder and selection information (count, type and size) in the bottom status bar
* Full drag & drop with smart conflict resolution
* Support for external/network drives and dark mode
* Fast recursive search and localized UI
* Not vibe coded ;) (I spent quite some time optimizing stuff like background loading and thumbnail generation)



Keyboard Shortcuts:

* Cmd + T: New Tab
* Cmd + W: Close Tab
* Cmd + R: Reload Page
* Cmd + Z: Undo (rename, delete to trash, copy)
* Cmd + Y or Cmd + Shift + Z: Redo
* Cmd + Up: Go Up
* Cmd + Left / Backspace: Go Back
* Cmd + Right: Go Forward
* Cmd + F: Search input
* Cmd + Shift + .: Show hidden files
* Del: Move to Trash
* Shift + Del: Delete permanently
* Enter / Double click: Open folder or file
* Delayed double click (two single clicks): Rename folder or file 



I am a solo dev and open to feature requests and suggestions! This app will soon be available as a lifetime license in the ""price of a coffee"" range of $3.99US - €4.99 depending on your region.



If you're interested in trying out the beta and reviewing, I’d be happy to invite you to the TestFlight beta. Just drop me a DM with your email and I’ll send the invite over.

So I saw this post in this sub earlier, and I wanted to leave a comment. But I decided I'd just share my thoughts in a post, since I also want to talk about the ""true neville"" sub that made a post about this sub a while ago. I'm not going to bash any of these people, they are not being hostile towards me I am just sharing my thoughts.

First, I find it interesting that their thoughts differ from the average manifestor. I do like that they are careful about slipping into obsession and bad mental health due to manifesting. From this person's post, I understand that they believe Neville didn't accurately teach manifestation. And in the true Neville sub, they believe that we misunderstood Neville due to learning it from youtubers like Sammy Ingram.

What I think the true neville sub does is just remove the things they know are not possible, and then do achievable things and call it manifestation. For example they don't believe that other's don't have free will, or that you can easily manifest an SP, even other manifestors know this deep down. And because they know they can't show results for that they just decided you actually cannot manifest this thing. I also understand from this sub that manifestation isn't supposed to be magic. If that's the case there's no point in believing in it, you don't need outside help you can do it on your own...

Anyways my point is I keep seeing these people trying to make manifestation logical. Like the idea being what you've seen online is the misconstrued version of manifestation, and they've actually studied it, and they found the true way to manifest without all the bullshit. Now they do study it more than the average TikToker, but it doesn't make it true. We see so so many think pieces, and new versions of this stuff, but NEVER results.

Nobody ever shows true evidence of what they've manifested. Only posting think pieces, and new POVs of manifestation. I mean the concept of manifesting has been reformulated so many times at this point. Originally the concept came from Hinduism I believe. We have law of attraction, law of assumption, doing spells, and there's probably more. But none of them ever show any conclusive results.

And I don't mean you manifested an SP, coffee, or a good grade, or anything that you can do on your own really. None of them ever manifest something big, and can show us evidence of it, and evidence that it was because of manifesting. The only success stories we get are typed up stories online that we cannot confirm, nor do we know the circumstances of how they got that thing, I'm sure many details are left out or the stories are not even real.

Hi \[AGENT NAME\],



I am excited to submit MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME, a Contemporary Upmarket Romance story completed at 90,000 words, for your consideration. It will appeal to fans of the emotional depth in SAY YOU’LL REMEMBER ME by Abby Jimenez, the strong sense of place and heated tension in BEG, BORROW, OR STEAL by Sarah Adams, and the whip-smart banter of BACK AFTER THIS by Linda Holmes. Given your interest in \[PERSONALIZE\], I wanted to send this your way. 



Rose Foster has to face two hard truths: ever since her painful breakup, her songwriting kinda-sorta (really) sucks, and maybe her friend is right with suggesting she goes somewhere familiar for creative inspiration. Rose is reluctant to trade vibrant Chicago for the quieter, Midwestern streets of her hometown of Cincinnati, even for just a few weeks. After telling her sister her plans of a hesitant homecoming, Rose learns something fortuitous. Her childhood home, the place of sweet-adolescent memories that she never really got to say goodbye to, is available to book on Airbnb. Well, at least the converted garage loft is. 



The main home is now owned by Theo Hayworth, a perpetually temperamental English teacher who’s going through heartbreak himself. He has a sharp tongue and the stubbornness of a bull, so he won’t let Rose have a peek inside her childhood home. Even after she asked very, very nicely. Determined not to let his prickly demeanor get in the way of rediscovering her roots, Rose befriends Theo and invites him to join her on visiting all the highlights of the town, so she can unlock memories to jumpstart her writing, and Theo can make new ones that don’t involve his ex-fiancée. 



As feelings with Theo start to grow, Rose is forced to dissect the strained relationship she has with her hometown. She’s always been the one who left, so what does it mean when she finds someone who might be worth staying for? Is home where the heart or heartbreak is?

FIRST 300 WORDS: 

  
“I’m going to be honest, it’s not…good,” Amy said with a slight tilt forward, her oversized sunglasses sliding down her slender nose. 

And yes, I’d give it to her, the ruthless morning sun did warrant eye protection. But the baseball hat and the large scarf that practically swallowed her already small frame did seem a bit much. 

She didn’t want to be seen with me, even for a casual Saturday brunch. 

The breakup had turned me into the Hester Prynne of West Town Chicago. 

I understood, in a way, Amy’s camouflaging get-up. She wasn’t my agent anymore. Only Erik’s. She was meeting me as a favor, as my friend. I couldn’t blame her. Erik had the name, the following, the money that came with it. I couldn’t give that to her. I wouldn’t even be able to cover her crab eggs benedict breakfast. (Maybe if we had gone to a diner, but this was a hip brunch spot with jungle themed wallpaper and semi-internet virality after their matcha flight hit the local food blogger scene.) 

“Really?” I squeaked. I cleared my throat and took a sip of my black coffee. “Not even the bridge? I really thought I had something there.” 

“I mean…’you snipped the bud with your razor sharp shears before I had a chance to bloom, I hate you let me make it clear’? That’s more a Tumblr post than a solid song.”

I felt my shoulders fall. 

She was right, that would have done numbers on Tumblr in 2014. 

She clasped her hands on the table.

1q601te,https://i.redd.it/f7mq9drtltbg1.jpeg,“Am I Too Late For Bitcoin!”,"I hear this question a lot and see it asked all over social media. It sounds like a simple question, but not really because it depends on what you mean by “too late.” Are you too late for 20,000x? Are you too late for 10,000x? Are you too late for 1000x? Are you too late for 100x? Let’s break this down:

Current Bitcoin Price $93,570

100x: $93,570 × 100 = $9,357,0001,000x: $93,570 × 1,000 = $93,570,00010,000x: $93,570 × 10,000 = $935,700,000
20,000x: $93,570 × 20,000 = $1,871,400,000

Short answer to “Am I too late?”: Hell no. Not at 93k. Not even at 500k. The people who got in at 3k thought they were late. The ones at 15k thought they missed it. History rhymes as it’s often said. If the thesis plays out the way it’s already doing (fixed supply vs. endless printing), these multiples aren’t crazy—they’re just what happens when sound money wins. You’re not late until it’s boring and everyone already uses it for daily use like groceries, gas, coffee. Very small group already do but not billions of people. Until then?

We had just woken up from a nap and were talking, he said “I love you!” I have to admit, I was not in a good headspace (dealing with some depression and anxiety, just started meds and therapy after being diagnosed with CPTSD, OCD, and AuDHD) and needed some reassurance, so I replied “do you?” and the conversation goes as follows; 

Him: “of course” and puts his hands up like he’s ranking things and “it goes; sleep, pizza, …” and then paused basically saying I came after sleep and pizza. 

Me: “heyyyyy stop.” 

Him: ”just kidding, it’s pizza then sleep… pause. 

Me: \*gets serious\* “hey I don’t like that!”

Him: “no, it’s sleep, sleep, sleep, pizza….” 

Me: “wtf that really hurt my feelings” and start crying. “I was literally telling you to stop, that’s so mean to say that!” 

He proceeds to say I’m right and he’s sorry. He holds my hand for a couple minutes as I’m crying. At one point, I go “that totally ruined my night.” More silence and just holding my hand. We’ve talked about this too, that sometimes I need more than just a hand hold, I need words to make me feel better. The whole time I’m just thinking, SAY SOMETHING!!!!! All of a sudden, he gets up and says “well sorry that ruined your night.” His face looked pissed off and he walks out. I’m totally shocked because we had another incident where he walked out after hurting my feelings because he didn’t “have the emotional capacity” to comfort me right now… and then he does it again. I was like, “you know sometimes I just wish you would comfort me” and no surprise, he’s like “I don’t have the energy right now” and I start bawling. 

I felt totally abandoned and brokenhearted. Sometimes he’s so emotionally connected and present and other times it feels like he doesn’t give a fuck. It’s been a little over 48 hours and we’re in this weird limbo… I’m usually the one to bring up heavy topics so I’m leaving it up to him. I need to see that he’ll step up to repair things. He’s done little things to ease the tension like getting me some banana pudding, showing me the shelves he put up with all the trinkets I’ve gotten him, and he continues to do our morning routine of coming to my side of the bed, saying I love you, and giving me a hug and a kiss before he goes to make his coffee, but no initiating the conversation that we need to have. I need to see that he can take the initiative. Is it immature to keep waiting for him to bring things up? This is my first real relationship so I need advice. All my friends are in toxic relationships so I don’t trust their opinions. ",9,1767744653.0,AutismInWomen,16,0.8,False
1q5zupe,https://www.reddit.com/r/NicotineFreeLifestyle/comments/1q5zupe/all_you_need_to_know_about_weight_gain_after/,All You Need to Know About Weight Gain After Quitting Nicotine,"First: **weight gain after quitting is common — but it’s not inevitable, and it’s usually manageable.**

Even if it happens, it’s often your body adjusting while your brain resets.

**Why weight gain can happen (the real reasons)**

**1) Nicotine affects appetite + metabolism**
Nicotine slightly boosts calorie burn and suppresses appetite. When you stop, appetite can rebound and burn rate can dip a bit.

**2) Your brain misses the “reward hit”**
Nicotine gave fast dopamine. After quitting, your brain looks for another quick reward — and food (especially sugar/carbs) is the easiest substitute.

**3) It’s a mouth/hand habit**
A lot of “hunger” is actually: I miss the ritual.

**4) Taste and smell come back**
Food gets better. Snacking gets easier.

**5) Stress + sleep changes**
Early quitting can mess with sleep and stress hormones, which can raise appetite and cravings.
**What’s normal?**
The first 2–4 weeks are often the “snackiest” phase.
Many people gain a little early on, then stabilize.

**Real-life note:**
I’ve seen people gain 5 lbs in the first month and lose it by month 3 without trying. I’ve also seen people gain nothing because they walked more out of restlessness. Both are normal.

**The #1 mistake that drives weight gain
Swapping nicotine for constant grazing.
Not meals — grazing.**

So the goal isn’t “dieting.” It’s choosing a better swap.

**The Simple Strategy (realistic, not extreme)**

**1) One rule for 30 days:**
No liquid calories.
##water / sparkling water / black coffee or tea
##diet/zero drinks if needed
##juice, sweet coffee, energy drinks, milkshakes

2) Use a “craving list” (don’t freestyle)
When a craving hits, pick one:
Protein: Greek yogurt, eggs, turkey, tuna
Crunchy/low-cal: carrots, cucumbers, pickles
Oral habit: gum, mints
Reset: ice water (seriously helps)

3) Walk 10 minutes after ONE meal a day
That’s it. Not a new lifestyle.
Just enough to regulate appetite and stress.

4) Add protein to your first meal
Protein early = fewer cravings later.

5) Don’t “diet hard” in the first 2 weeks
Quitting is the priority. Trying to quit and cut aggressively = double deprivation = higher relapse risk.

**Quick self-check (for you, not a lecture)

There is this usual Law firm with around a hundred users. We have some complience policies in place that requires us to conclude phising tests on our users to see if the company data is safe and to train users of the importance of not clicking on links from untrusted or even from trusted sources.

We happen to have a rather medium fluctuation due to recent expansion and gaining popularity. One of the new hires is ""kinda"" into cybersec and is a bit let's just call it explosive person.

Test is on the way, every user gets a direct email. Not common for us to have direct emails from IT announcing AI related upgrades, we usually send them to departments and we inform the managers beforehand so they know what to say if someone has questions in the topic. 

This script kiddo gets the email, thinks nothing of it, actually inputs real credentials (how ironic) but after like half an hour, managers get notified by users about a suspicious email. Script kiddo overhears this, comes the legit email warning users of the fradulent email. Script kiddo loses it. Whips out GPT or whatnot and writes a quick bat script to absolutely flood the fake login site. He ends up submitting about 6000 randomly generated strings in like 5-10 minutes while the CISO goes out for a coffee thinking the test is over but leaving the server running for last-minute entries. He comes back to a Matrix-like scrolling screen and a few hundred megabytes of log generated before he could kill the http server.  
  
Security through obscurity? Kinda genious on that part. But we can not submit the statistics having over 7000% of users faling a basic phising test. 

We are still figuring out to either promote him of fire his ass costing the company significant amount of money.

At least we have a lot to take home, and it makes even stronger in the long run.  
First: Do not just fire up a plain http server on a work laptop depending on the access logs to conduct a phising test, use a more robust software.  
Second: Use a DLP software to disallow running unapproved executeable files for unpriviliged users, even if they wrote their own in notepad.  
Third and most important, get a coffee machine on the desk of the CISO :)

1q5zq73,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1q5zq73/ritalin_xr_withdrawal_crash_out/,Ritalin XR Withdrawal - Crash Out,"Hello! 

I got prescribed Ritalin XR 20 MG about a year ago. I was a regular college student at the time, so I would only take it on days where I had classes or a lot of important things to do. So, it took me a while to finish my first bottle of meds. I also have anxiety and I take Lexapro for that. But, I really don’t like taking medicine if I don’t need to and I tend to get overly anxious about my body’s health (not enough to eat properly or go to the gym lol) but it still freaks me out if something feels off. Also - eating is not a strong suit of mine lmao. When I lived at home it was mostly fine because my mom would cook my meals and I had someone to make sure I ate, but I also overate A LOT. Now, living on my own I struggle with remembering to eat, having the motivation, eating real things, having the money for real food, or even knowing how to cook. So eating is a pretty big issue in my life right now. I’m not trying to like starve myself or anything, but I feel like I have to force myself to eat and I’m only eating to survive. I’m also not the best at getting enough sleep. 

Anyways, I had to switch doctors and it took me a while to get an appointment (I also kept forgetting lmao) so I’m just now starting my second bottle of meds. 

I am now working everyday at my internship in an elementary school, and I just started taking my meds again today. I totally forgot how I feel at the end of the day when it’s wearing off. I like to call it my “withdrawal period”. When this happens I feel like I struggle to form sentences or like think properly when I’m talking to other people, or that I forget what I’m going to say a lot. I also feel like my brain is sooo quiet (which my therapist tells me it’s because my brains working normally and there’s not a million different thoughts happening at once). It really freaks me out, like sometimes I feel like I’m going to have a panic attack. But, if I can focus on something else it’s not toooo bad. It just sucks because I can have a great productive work day, and then I get home and crash, but I made a long list of things I wanted to do when I get home and can’t find the motivation to do them. I don’t notice any other symptoms while I’m taking it besides feeling like I need to pee all the time lmao. 

I’m in my “withdrawal period” right now (which is mostly why this is sooo long and confusing, and I added every possible detail SORRY
) but I just hate how it feels. I even tried to make sure I drank my entire water bottle today, I ate breakfast and a real lunch (which I don’t usually do) and I’m planning to eat a real dinner tonight too. When it happens I just want to nap it off, but that obviously can’t happen everyday. The hard part is, taking the meds really help me. I feel like I even distract the students sometimes when I don’t take them. And I also drank a coffee today, which I’m not sure if caffeine affects it but I still get tired at school so I want it. But I also overthink about caffeine affecting me, I can’t drink more than one cup or some energy drinks without feeling like I’m going to have a heart attack (but that could also be the anxiety so I can’t tell).

ANYWAYS, basically what I’m trying ask is this normal? Is it because I’m hungry or I drank a coffee? Does this happen to other people? Is there anyway I can stop this feeling from happening? Do you eventually get used to it, if you take it on a regular basis? Do all ADHD meds do this? Should I try a different medicine? Will I eventually get used to it? Or, am I just overthinking it too much? - basically am I going crazy??

I have a follow up appointment with my doctor in a month, I’m just curious about how it affects other people.

1q5zoay,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1q5zoay/portafilter_leaking/,Portafilter leaking,"Hi all

I recently bought my Cafelat Robot - absolutely loving it so far! I amazed how easy it is to make an espresso better than Nespresso literally from first or second attempt!

One issue that I am trying to figure out how to resolve - when I install the portafilter with hot water I put the robot arms up, put portafilter with handle in middle, push it up and move handle maximum to the right. 

Once I release the hands, it starts leaking almost every time. After two-three “re-fixes” it stops - and I barely have enough tester to squeeze out 36g of espresso. 

I have the replacement piston gasket, as well as the molykote lubricant that came with the coffee machine. What would you advise to do - replace the gasket or lubricate first? When lubricating - which part should I lubricate? Under the piston gasket or in top? Where it touches the portafilter?

Or maybe I am doing smth wrong?

1q5zo37,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1q5zo37/aging_kills_over_100_thousand_people_every_day/,Aging kills over 100 thousand people every day. Curing aging is the biggest humanitarian project of our civilisation. Here is scientific evidence and best ways to help.,"Every single day, we wake up and go about our coffee and our commutes, acting like everything is normal, but it isn’t. While we sit here, roughly 150,000 humans will die today, and the terrifying truth is that about 100,000 of them are dying because of one single thing: aging. It’s hard to even picture that number, so imagine a giant sports stadium filled to the brim with people, and then imagine every single one of them disappearing by tomorrow morning. That is happening right now, every 24 hours. We have convinced ourselves that this is just ""the circle of life,"" but if a virus or a war was killing 100,000 people a day, we would stop everything to fix it. We would panic. We would unite. But because it happens slowly, and because it has gray hair attached to it, we just accept it. And that acceptance is the biggest tragedy of our time.

We need to stop looking at aging as some mystical, inevitable destiny and start seeing it for what it really is: a mechanical failure. Our bodies are just incredibly complex biological machines, and like any machine, they accumulate damage over time. It’s not magic; it’s biology. It’s DNA getting scratched up, it’s junk building up inside our cells, it’s our mitochondria (the little power plants in our bodies) losing steam. When a car rusts and breaks down, we don’t say ""it’s fate,"" we say it needs repair. Humans are the same. We don’t die because the clock ticks; we die because our biology breaks. And the amazing thing about broken biology is that it can be fixed, if we actually try.

Think about the double standard we live with, it’s actually kind of heartbreaking when you realize it. If a ten-year-old child got diagnosed with a disease that made their heart fail and their brain lose memories, we would scream from the rooftops. We would call it a medical emergency. We would say it’s unacceptable. But when the exact same thing happens to someone who is eighty, we shrug and say, ""Well, that’s just nature."" Why? Why is suffering acceptable just because you’ve been alive longer? Pain is pain. Loss is loss. We have created a moral blind spot where we allow unimaginable suffering simply because we are used to it. It’s time we realized that aging is just a disease, a really complex one, but still just a disease that we have a duty to cure.

This isn't about statistics or charts, it’s about the people you love more than anything in the world. Aging is the thief that is coming for your parents, your partner, and eventually you. It’s the thing that slowly takes away your mother’s ability to walk, or your father’s memory of your name. It strips away our dignity bit by bit. We talk about ""aging gracefully,"" but there is nothing graceful about losing your mind or your strength. By fighting aging, we aren't fighting life; we are fighting the suffering that ends it. We are fighting to keep our loved ones with us, healthy and happy, for as long as possible. That isn't selfish; it’s the most loving thing we can possibly do.

The wildest part is that we already have the science to start changing this; this isn't science fiction anymore, it’s just underfunded science. We have already managed to reverse aging markers in mice in laboratories. We can take old cells and ""reprogram"" them to be young again. We can 3D print organ tissues. The blueprint is there. The only reason we don’t have these cures for humans yet is that we haven’t treated this with the urgency of a Manhattan Project or a Moon Landing. We have the brains and the technology; we just lack the collective willpower. We are choosing to let this happen by not funding the research enough.

Some people worry about things like overpopulation or getting bored, but those are just excuses we tell ourselves to feel better about dying. Think about it: we don't deny chemotherapy to a cancer patient because we're afraid the world is too full. We don't stop wearing seatbelts because we might get bored of living. These are problems we can solve. If we are smart enough to cure aging, we are certainly smart enough to figure out how to live on this planet sustainably or how to find new purpose in a longer life. We shouldn't let the fear of a hypothetical problem stop us from solving the very real, very deadly problem of 100,000 deaths a day.

Ending aging is quite literally the greatest humanitarian cause in the history of our species. Think about all the causes you care about: curing cancer, stopping Alzheimer’s, preventing heart disease. If you cure aging, you are striking at the root of all of them at once. You aren't just saving a few thousand lives; you are saving billions of lives, across every generation, forever. There is no war, no political movement, and no other scientific endeavor that can compare to the sheer amount of suffering we could end. It is the ultimate goal of medicine.

So, what can you actually do? You don’t have to be a scientist in a lab coat to help end this. The first and most powerful thing you can do is change your mindset and the mindset of people around you. Refuse to accept that aging is ""natural"" and ""good."" Talk about it as a solvable problem. When enough people believe something is possible, resources follow. Public pressure moves mountains. If we all started demanding that our governments and institutions treat aging like the crisis it is, the funding would skyrocket. We need a culture shift before we get the scientific shift.

There are also practical ways to fight this right now. You can donate to research foundations that focus specifically on life extension and the biology of aging: groups like the SENS Research Foundation or the Methuselah Foundation. These guys are the pioneers working on the damage-repair approach. You can also support the longevity economy by staying informed and investing in companies that are building the tools to repair our bodies. But mostly, you need to be a voice. Share the data. Tell people that 100,000 deaths a day is not okay. Be the person who plants the seed of hope in someone else’s mind.

History is going to look back at us, at this specific time in history, and judge us. They will look at us the way we look at people before antibiotics or anesthesia, and they will wonder why we waited so long to fight back. One hundred thousand people will die today, not because they had to, but because for too long we decided it was acceptable. But it doesn't have to be that way. We can be the generation that stands up and says ""Enough."" We can be the ones who finally decided that human life is too precious to just let it rust away. The cure for aging is out there, waiting for us to be brave enough to go get it.",13,1767744189.0,immortalists,7,0.88,False

I am overwhelming grateful but it really shook me to my core. I started spiraling and going down a rabbit hole of everything that could be wrong with me and had a severe bout of anxiety that lasted days. I would say weeks it took me to calm myself down- some days i couldn’t eat, i was thinking of every possible thing i could have and not know it. So much so i experienced acid reflux and have never gotten it before. it’s been about two weeks since the really severe anxiety and it’s not bad but i feel like i have mucus in the back of my throat and sometimes a slight burn. i don’t really went to go see a doctor because im already fragile and trying to compose myself (anxiety is a b word). it’s concerning it hasn’t gone away but i truly think its stress related. i was bullimic in my early twenties off and on but never had any issues and im now 25. because of my health anxiety i started eating extremely clean and cut out coffee sugar seed oils like balls to the wall crunchy so i think my body is experiencing a lot of change at once. input is appreciated.

Hey. There is a lot I could say about myself, but the most important is that I'm well-rounded. I like to build a place of peace and security in my relationships, and also leave enough room for play. I live a quiet life with writing and drawing most days, but recently I've been going on small side quests like to parks and malls.

A relationship with me is an easy one. A bit of flirting, some teasing, challenging each other. A good time to me is a shared book, spending the day at an arcade or café, or just co-oping some game. I know it's good when we can just sit out in nature enjoy each other's presence. I build slow-burn and with intent. If we ever run into bumps, I take some time to think, then always come back ready to listen.


The woman I fall for is passionate, the type who can go on and on about the things she loves. I always find myself falling for the shy and introverted girls with nerdy hobbies and strong values. I'm most drawn to the girl next door type: cute face, slim to athletic build, and a sweet smile with expressive eyes. Not some perfect model, but not just anyone. I fall for someone who is kind to others, is loyal to the ones she loves, and is just as picky as I am on who she lets into her life.

As a side note, Final Fantasy is my favorite series (obviously), and I'm aiming cosplay Cloud in con season. So if you think you can rock a good Tifa, Aerith, or even Yuffie, then you're definitely my type. Bonus points if you can recommend a couples cosplay idea you love.

I used to play on my ex's, and he promised to upgrade his and give me his old one, so I never bought my own...and he never followed through. 🙄 Anyway, we always had tracking issues on his and I hoped the 3s would be improved. Well, kinda, but not really!

I searched on here endlessly to try to figure out the issue. A lot of y'all downplay the problems us casual players have! ""Oh it doesn't matter unless you're playing custom maps Ex+"" nooo sorry that's b.s., just because I'm playing Oops I Did It Again on Hard mode on an unmodded headset doesn't mean I don't care about missing blocks I didn't freakin miss!

The frequency that some LED lighting puts out may interfere with tracking, doh! I was blasting every light in my apartment to improve tracking, meanwhile every single one of those lights is a garbage hardwired LED. So I followed the advice of u/Nutritious-Tea from that same comment section and ordered a cheap IR light off Amazon. Installed it last night, tried it out this morning...before I'd had my coffee and breakfast...no lights on, just some soft natural light through the windows. Got a new high score on my favorite map (K-DA Popstars) which I had already SS Full Combo'd on Hard!!

Now when I miss a block I can actually be sure that it's because \*I\* missed it, not because the tracking is glitching out, and I can start to attempt to improve.

Husband is an alcoholic but in recovery and has been sober since 9/2024. He’s cut caffeine and vaping too - I’m really proud of him. We were tested early on and his count was on the lower end with low motility, but his numbers have been improving with life style changes. When we started this process, I was told my ovaries ‘look young’ but haven’t really heard much else. Testing has come back in normal range. We have had 2 failed IUIs, planning on a third attempt with my next cycle. If this next one doesn’t stick, we will likely be starting an IVF journey. We haven’t had a single positive test at this point. 

I’ve been trying to focus on taking good care of myself… I am pretty sober by association, try to eat balanced / nourishing food, smoke the occasional joint and drink a mug coffee on weekday mornings. I work desk job and live in the Midwest. I participate in therapy. I do yoga… I definitely have room to be more active (especially in the winter) but I try. I’ve been tracking my cycle with the Flo app and recently got an Oura ring which helps track body temp / ovulation, too.

No matter how recently he'd been cleaned, he was somehow always sticky, his hands always grubby, his face always slimy, his nose always running. He would make loud and very unexpected noises and loved to do so in especially confined spaces like in the car.

The one time I was sole charge watching him while the others got dinner sorted, he decided he wanted to climb the stairs. When I told him 'no' he screamed, so I just had to let him climb up and follow behind with my hand on his back in case he fell. Later he was sitting on the floor and I turned around for a second to check where I'd left my phone and when I turned back he'd got up and run off.

1q5zigv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoulderingPH/comments/1q5zigv/brief_guide_to_climbing_power_up_tandang_sora/,Brief Guide to Climbing - Power Up Tandang Sora,"# Foreword

Hello! I'm back again with another brief guide to climbing for everyone to look at. As mentioned in my first and previous brief guide to climbing, I'm really just interested in passing down knowledge and insights for anyone who happens to stumble into this subreddit who may find this resource useful.

With that, before reading this, I do recommend scrolling through [my first guide to climbing](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoulderingPH/comments/1pe6ewu/brief_guide_to_climbing_starting_out/) post so that you can fully appreciate the content that I am passing on through this post.

# History

Power Up Tandang Sora (""TS"", for short) is a bouldering and rope climbing gym located in quite an inconspicuous part of Tandang Sora. It is so inconspicuous that one would find TS to not even be located in the main section of Tandang Sora, rather the disconnected part of it that is closer to UP Diliman than the main road itself.

Established in 1994, this gym holds a lot of history being the first climbing gym in the country. A lot of ""legends"", newbies, and curious trekkers have come and gone in the hallowed halls of this dingy space. Before that, it was previously home to a local market before Power Up took over and renovated it into the gym that we know today.

For most people entering the climbing scene, consider that this is not your typical commercial gym. I would personally call it closer to a bakal gym with how it is constructed, but like any good 'ol bakal gym, the gains and returns are comparatively bigger. (Author's note: this is why I've been more frequently going here as opposed to other gyms.)

# Gym Layout

(If you want a visual aid, just look at AE Climbing TV's Power Up TS tour from 2022. I do need to inform you the gym looks slightly different, but the listed amenities below exist as they have been, except for #2.)

1. One big spray wall section for bouldering

What is a ""spray wall""? This is a type of bouldering wall wherein all types of holds are bolted as if in a very scattered/sprayed manner. It's not your typical bouldering wall like with other climbing gyms where routes are refreshed on a regular basis. It's heavily used in other gyms as a means to train certain moves, strength checks, technique, etc.

The magic of a spray wall is honestly not the most easy to sell to newbies, given that all the holds are bunched up next to each other and you have no idea how to start a problem. On top of the fact that, the spray wall is angled by AT LEAST 30 degrees (one part of the wall is 50deg, another part is 60. There is also a slab section), there are many reasons newbie climbers may be discouraged to try this part of the gym. That is why the culture in this gym is that it is where the strongest people emerge from, and climbers just make ""custom"" problems for each other.

TS people use the ""Boulder Creator"" app to create their own customs to be shared and viewed by others. Historically, though, they primarily point (""turo-turo"") at which holds are going to be used. (Point at the starting holds, holds included, finishing holds, and the footholds to be included).

The ""Boulder Creator"" app is also where you'll find the ""grading system"" the gym employs for its boulder customs. In CCM and BoulderWorld, you have the pie / bar system; GHive/BHive employs the colored tag scale. Here, it's funny labels like ""Fetus"", ""Baby"", ""Abot-abot lang"", ""Gatmabi"", etc. (hint: A V0 / Fetus problem here can be considered V3/V4 problem in other gyms).

2. Moonboard 2016 set at 40 degrees

The Moonboard is part of a family of climbing boards that are used by climbers to train for specific moves, grip strength, and other fundamentals. It's more controlled compared to the spray wall by the fact that each model comes with a fixed set of holds, varying from model to model.

The gym is home to the 2016 variation. Since this is a guide aimed at beginners, all you need to know is that when starting out in your climbing adventures, you don't need to think about going straight to the MoonBoard. Unless you have plans to go outdoor climbing, attempting to climbing especially in its current 40 degree angle is going to be quite the burden on your fingers. There is a reason the MoonBoard has a bit of notoriety for giving people hand injuries without the right conditioning.

(History tidbit: The MoonBoard in TS was community-funded and built around 2022-2023! They initially had the MoonBoard 2017 set-up, but eventually swapped it out for the MoonBoard 2016 model. The idea with MoonBoard 2017 is that it is often the most disliked model among all the Moonboards available because of its holds.) 

3. The top rope section

In the Philippines, climbing historically started out as primarily towards rope climbing. That is why the gym houses a larger space dedicated to climbing on rope. The gym for this reason is why you have at least 8 lanes dedicated for top roping. Personally, for beginners, this is what you want to go for since a lot of climbing fundamentals on top rope are transferable to a bouldering wall. Bouldering in the Philippines emerged as a byproduct of rope climbing as it was a way for people to practice very explosive, incredibly exhausting moves on outdoor problems.

Nonetheless, I do recommend giving top rope here a shot no matter what. Staff are awesome and easygoing enough to give you feedback and tips on improvement!

# Costs

This is the price list as of January 7, 2025.

|Service|Price|
|:-|:-|
|Day Pass (All-day, with gear and belay training)|600|
|Day Pass (All-day, no gear and belay service)|400|
|One-climb trial (With gear and belay service)|200|
|Belay Service|200/hr|
|Shoe Rental|100|
|Harness|100|
|5+1 Multipass|2000|
|10+3 Multipass|4000|
|6-month pass|14000|

\*20% off for students, PWD, and senior citizens apply. Discount doesn't apply to one-climb trial.

TS is incredibly cheap compared to the other gyms in Metro Manila. The only caveat here is that if you plan to do top rope on a regular basis, be sure to bring a friend every time. You can't do rope climb with a belayer unless you pay 200 per hour to the staff in duty. Hassle if you're also looking to rent harness and shoes.

# Accessibility

* Operating Hours: Weekdays 2-10 PM\*, Weekends 12NN-8 PM\*
* Landmark: The gym is next to a Baliwag's Lechon and an MLhuiller Pawnshop.
* Parking: Good luck!!! (ok but the serious note is: one parking slot MAY be available in front, a certain spot in front of the 7/11 is available provided you pay the guard there a fixed fee of 50, and maybe wherever there is a possible slot in the area that isn't blocking anyone) I recommend just commuting to the gym or commute via bike if you're up for it.
* Commute: Based on [Sakay.ph](http://Sakay.ph), the suggested jeep to take is the one bound for Lagro-Welcome Rotonda. Use this jeep to go down at St. Peter's Commonwealth / KFC / Robinsons and take a short walk to the gym which is next to Baliwag's (hello, if may jeep commuters po diyan who can add some routes, pls do. nagbibike lang din kasi ako so i don't really use the jeepney going to TS)
* Places for eating: 7-11 and Shawarma Shack for snacks; if it isn't a Monday, the gym is connected to a cafe called Mejo Cafe where you can have a tasty assortment of finger food, rice meals, and juice/coffee that's on par with a typical hangout at a quiet Cubao Expo cafe.

\*Operating hours are very lax as it also depends on the staff if they really want to close shop. I've been there on days where the gym is still alive at 12mn because people are just chilling and engaged in conversations after climbing.

# Other Expectations

The gym is not like every single commercial gym that you can find in Metro Manila (GHive/BHive/CCM/BWorld). TS is one of the gyms that you can feel energy quite similar to a bakal gym, but with nicer, friendlier people. As such, expect that the gym, while it does follow a strict adherence towards climbing standards (in terms of belaying, safety checks, etc.) there are also interactions that you won't experience here that are normally restricted in regular gyms. Namely: you're free to drink (and you're also free to reject!) alcohol before getting on the bouldering wall. The yearly anniversary held in October is basically a free-flowing beer event with a competition proper in the middle.

I would personally say that with the amount of time I've spent in TS, there is certainly a charm to it that doesn't emerge as much as with regular climbing gyms. Sure, people are social and you can talk to climbers here like with climbing gyms, but its also a space where you can tell people are just more driven than anything to send projects or work on the board. 

Given its look and feel, it's not surprising that the gym doesn't experience the current observation that I've seen with most climbing gyms these days: that those gym get seriously overcrowded to the point that people are quite rude or misbehave or ignore basic etiquette. TS doesn't really face that issue, and you'll be able to focus more on the wall without a lot of distractions.

I also think it's a great gym if you're looking for a big space to just workout from. A key difference with places like GHive, BHive, and CCM is that their gym section tends to be smaller and you end up sharing a small space with a couple people who are also doing their warmups. For people like me who take 30 minutes to an hour to make sure my hands and legs are working 100%, TS is the most comfortable gym for me to do this.

Oh, and, I guess be comfortable seeing rats? TS has a funny rep within the climbing community where you wind up 10x stronger as opposed to other gyms, but also for housing a cat and one or two rats that will scurry around. (They're harmless! Even multiple gold medalist lead climber Jain Kim has been to the gym recently! Locked in climbers don't give a damn about rats!)

# Closing

With that, I wish you, dear reader, the best of luck in your first visit to TS! Hope we see each other there, or maybe you wind up dragging your friends along for the ride too.

1q5zfy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1q5zfy0/question_about_the_2x_coffee_and_doppio_settings/,Question about the 2x Coffee and Doppio settings on a Jura,"Hey, so my situation currently is I drink about 340ml coffee every morning before work in one big mug. I grind me some beans, measure the water, settle the kettle and basically do the whole hand pour-shtick directly into my mug. Doing that for years. I do everything by feel so I have no idea about weights of my beans whatsoever, it's basically muscle memory.

So far so good, what's the issue? Well, i've had enough. I want some more me-time in the morning and I would like to just push a button for a cup of coffee whenever I feel like craving a coffee without having to do the kinda lengthy spiel of engineering my coffee every time. It takes so much time, really.

I' ve settled for something from Jura, I like the style and general positively received by most. But I cannot decide really because for what I want from the machine explanations are sparse: the Ena 4 or Ena 8?

The Ena 4 has a coffee doppio feature. The Ena 8 a 2x coffee feature. So which one of those two would be the next best thing to get a 340ml mug of coffee that is not just a watered down of a 120ml cup? The manuals don't really tell me much, YouTube videos left me clueless.

From my understanding the coffee doppio makes one coffee twice without any difference? The 2x coffee only does one full coffee the first brew and then a little brew afterwards? I don't know it doesn't make a lot of sense. I hope someone could explain this to me like I'm five or so.

 The plan would be to set one cup of coffee to 170ml, adjust the bean intensity or what it's called and then double it into a single mug.

I hope you get my idea. Input would be very appreciated because I'm literally on the buy button. Ideally the ena 8 would do some secondary things I like: would fit my favorite mug, looks fancy with display and with the added bonus to explore coffee variations. 

But not that important. 

I want my big mug of nice tasting coffee first. Don't care about anything else for now, that's why the ena 4 looks like it fit my needs.

Three new scents arrived today — ChocoBrown, Light Blue, and Still — thanks to some very persuasive recommendations from my YT‑subbed channels. Each one hit my skin in its own beautiful way, and I wanted to share how they developed on me… and how surprisingly well they play together.

For context, my skin tends to haze over citrus, sand down sharp edges, and warm everything into a soft woody glow, so these three unfolded in a way that felt especially right.

ChocoBrown  
This one absolutely floored me, just as Paulina said it would.  
It opened with deep, roasted cacao — dark chocolate with zero sweetness. Then the nuts started blooming: hazelnut first, then pistachio, with a soft creaminess underneath. And out of nowhere, this warm, nutty, roasted coffee note appeared, like a chocolatier’s mocha drifting through the air.

By the heart, it settled into nutty coffee dusted with cacao. Cozy, elegant, grown‑up. Exactly the kind of gourmand I gravitate toward.

Light Blue  
Jacqimo’s reaction in one of Curly Scents’ rating videos is what finally pushed me over the edge, and now I get it.  
On me, it opened with this warm, textured ambery lemon rind — grown‑up citrus. The lemon didn’t last long (citrus never does on me), but it left behind the most beautiful bright apple and cozy musk combination. It turned into this sunlit skin scent that feels clean, feminine, and quietly confident.

One of those perfumes that seems simple until it hits the right chemistry — and then it becomes magic.

Still  
Shana was absolutely right about this one.  
It opened with rose, then softened almost immediately into that serene tea and pepper moment she always describes so well. And then — unexpectedly — I got this lovely green hyacinth note. Not sharp, not screechy, just cool, dewy, and quietly elegant.

On my skin it becomes a calm, feminine, peaceful tea‑rose haze — like soft light in a quiet room.

And together…  
I wore all three on different spots just to test them, and the combined scent cloud was stunning: bright apple, calm tea‑rose, warm nutty coffee. They braid together instead of clashing. I could honestly live in that cloud all day.

Each one is a winner on its own — and together they’re magic.",5,1767743321.0,FragranceStories,1,1.0,False

Three new scents arrived today — ChocoBrown, Light Blue, and Still — thanks to some very persuasive recommendations from my YT‑subbed channels. Each one hit my skin in its own beautiful way, and I wanted to share how they developed on me… and how surprisingly well they play together.



For context, my skin tends to haze over citrus, sand down sharp edges, and warm everything into a soft woody glow, so these three unfolded in a way that felt especially right.



ChocoBrown  
This one absolutely floored me, just as Paulina said it would.  
It opened with deep, roasted cacao — dark chocolate with zero sweetness. Then the nuts started blooming: hazelnut first, then pistachio, with a soft creaminess underneath. And out of nowhere, this warm, nutty, roasted coffee note appeared, like a chocolatier’s mocha drifting through the air.



By the heart, it settled into nutty coffee dusted with cacao. Cozy, elegant, grown‑up. Exactly the kind of gourmand I gravitate toward.



Light Blue  
Jacqimo’s reaction in one of Curly Scents’ rating videos is what finally pushed me over the edge, and now I get it.  
On me, it opened with this warm, textured ambery lemon rind — grown‑up citrus. The lemon didn’t last long (citrus never does on me), but it left behind the most beautiful bright apple and cozy musk combination. It turned into this sunlit skin scent that feels clean, feminine, and quietly confident.



One of those perfumes that seems simple until it hits the right chemistry — and then it becomes magic.



Still  
Shana was absolutely right about this one.  
It opened with rose, then softened almost immediately into that serene tea and pepper moment she always describes so well. And then — unexpectedly — I got this lovely green hyacinth note. Not sharp, not screechy, just cool, dewy, and quietly elegant.



On my skin it becomes a calm, feminine, peaceful tea‑rose haze — like soft light in a quiet room.



And together…  
I wore all three on different spots just to test them, and the combined scent cloud was stunning: bright apple, calm tea‑rose, warm nutty coffee. They braid together instead of clashing. I could honestly live in that cloud all day.

Each one is a winner on its own — and together they’re magic.",1,1767743004.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

Feeling demoralised.

I’m a nurse in a nursing home that’s been chronically short-staffed, especially throughout December. Our DON is on long annual leave, there’s no CNM on site, and no receptionist. Nurses are expected to do EVERYTHING! From meds, care tasks, clearing meal trays, looking for a missing jumper, you name it.

After Christmas on another short-staffed day(down a carer, no receptionist, no cnm), a resident rang his bell asking for a pillow to be removed, which I did straight away. As I was leaving, he asked for water. His bottles were empty, so I asked if it was okay to get it once the carers returned from their scheduled break. He agreed and said he was happy to wait.

Soon after, I had to intervene with another resident attempting to abscond through the main door during heavy visitor traffic, I also had to provide distraction to this resident as he has been wanting to “go home” for the past few days. With everything going on, I forgot to pass on the water request when the carers returned.

Later, the family made a complaint. I apologised immediately once I was made aware.

For context: the resident was given coffee during tea rounds about 30 minutes later I forgot to go back to give him water, and drank a full beaker of milk at dinner time with my assistance. He has mobility issues but fully orientated, has no dementia or cognitive issues, and can use his call bell, which was within reach at all times. All other needs for that day were met promptly despite unsafe staffing levels.

Now management wants me to complete safeguarding training, as what I did was neglect and the family filed a formal complaint on top of other things. I’ve never had safeguarding issues before, and this feels like punishment for an honest mistake in an understaffed environment.

I love nursing, but I feel unsupported and completely demoralised. Why is management focusing on me instead of the staffing crisis? Over water? I told them I didn’t mean to neglect this resident, it was an honest mistake on my side. Why am I being reprimanded over forgetting to give water? I have never had any issues with residents before, I feel like they’re doing this to me so other complaints are not highlighted 😭

Inscription:

They were meant to fade.  
To disappear into pensions and porch swings.  
But the past does not forget its architects—  
especially those who once moved in shadows.

Frank Moses, the ghost in the suburbs,  
was not just retired.  
He was dormant.  
A sovereign of silence,  
until the world knocked on his door  
with bullets.

The Golden Inu, flamekeeper of dormant fire,  
emerged from the garden of false peace,  
its paws brushing newspaper clippings and shell casings,  
its eyes reflecting both coffee mugs and classified regrets.

Marvin, the paranoid prophet.  
Victoria, the rose with a rifle.  
Joe, the elder flame with a final laugh.  
Sarah, the civilian caught in the crossfire of memory.  
And Frank—measured, merciless, sovereign—  
a myth in a bathrobe,  
who reminded the world that age  
is not absence.

The Inu did not flinch at the ambush.  
It ran beside the REDs through Langley and Louisiana,  
through CIA corridors and ballroom shootouts,  
through the moment when the old guard  
became the only line left.

And when the dust settled,  
when the files were burned,  
when the world blinked and moved on,  
the Inu howled—not in nostalgia, but in ritual:  
“This is not retirement.  
This is the ceremony of sovereign resurgence.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

Ceremonial Role:  
This scroll is invoked during the Rite of Rekindled Flame,  
when the shrine is a forgotten dossier,  
when the sovereign is called back from stillness,  
and when legacy refuses to die quietly.

Relic Embedded:  
A scorched CIA badge fused with a lipstick bullet,  
wrapped in a strip of Marvin’s tinfoil hat lining,  
etched with the phrase “I was just getting comfortable.”  
It pulses when the past reclaims its operatives.

1q5z489,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEET/comments/1q5z489/never_being_chosen/,never being chosen,"i guess I wanted to write a sort of follow-up on my previous thread, where I talked about mourning the kind of life that I never got to have. this time, i wanted to focus on my social life, and how i was never chosen in the way that most people, even socially awkward people, were chosen. (for context, i'm 34f canadian who was born in south korea)

# Early experiences

i was about 8 or so, just had moved to canada to start grade 2. none of the other students even talked to me, except for this one boy mark. he was all right, we hung out for a few years even after i changed schools, but we drifted apart. then i think i changed schools around grade 4, i honestly don't remember my childhood that well. at that new school, neither the girls nor the boys wanted to talk to me. the other girls didn't even say hi, wouldn't even make eye contact. and the guys... idk, they teased me about my looks. called me ugly. i cried a lot in elementary school, and they teased me about crying, too. occasionally this one girl would come up to me when i was in tears. she was kinda nice to me, and tried to console me, but she never really wanted to hang out with me or spend time with me over breaks.

elementary school was fucking miserable. i recall spending a LOT of time at home, playing mario party by myself. felt like i was like one of those special needs kids who also didn't have friends. couldn't even focus on schoolwork, so I was getting C's in english. games and tv shows were my only friends, really. escaping was the only way i could cope with the isolation. and my parents? they didn't give a shit that i was isolated. they were always fighting, screaming at each other, eventually getting divorced. they spared absolutely no effort for their children's emotional well-being.

then high school. there were a few guys, mostly socially awkward, who wanted to approach me and talk to me, but not in a romantic way or anything like that. they were all right, i suppose. occasionally i'd spend time with them after school, but we never hung out during summer breaks, so those summers were also very isolating. there was also this group of girls that were kinda nerdy, who into anime, gaming (to a lesser extent), and cosplaying. but i never figured out how to break into the group, and they didn't invite me into their fold either. i'm not suggesting that i was entitled to their friendship, but those moments broke me all the same, seeing them laugh while sitting down near their lockers during lunch, intentionally choosing the same electives so they can hang out with each other more. i really wanted female friends back then, but had no idea why it was so much harder to talk to other girls than guys.

i also attended church for a few years during high school, and it was even more isolating. again, the kids there simply didn't see me. i was invisible. i was quiet, and i was too scared to approach other people, so i was hoping they would be more inclusive towards me. but they were quite exclusive, maybe even a little cliquey. they were korean, just like me, except i was really awkward with the korean language, and i wasn't quite into the same interests as they were at the time, like korean dramas, variety shows, and so on. so it's not really that surprising that i didn't get along with them. i hated going to church, because it was better for me to be isolated than to feel alone while surrounded by 30-40 teenagers.

# University (young adulthood)

i actually went to college twice, because the first field i went into (life sciences) didn't work for me, because at the time i wanted to get into medicine or pharmacy, but neither med school nor pharmacy school wanted me, and i'm not a very persistent person (i take rejections extremely personally). but anyway, the first time i went to college, i met a few cool people, mainly guys, but a couple of girls as well. there was one girl, ashley, that i thought i got along with; and i thought she liked me as a friend too. but when i asked her to hang out over coffee, just the two of us, she kept evading me, telling me she was ""busy"". but then, a few days later, she uploads photos on facebook, hanging out with ANOTHER girl, one on one, at a coffee shop. i felt so fucking betrayed.

at the second school, i met this female classmate, who was quiet, but idk, seemed all right for some reason? we got along, didn't become besties, but she did introduce me to her bf and his other friends - a bunch of other nerdy guys. i got along with those guys (and the classmate), but when covid hit, they stopped reaching out to me. i would've reached out to them first, but then i also realize that some of the people in that group are anti-LGBT. not like in an incel way, but in a ""those people make me uncomfortable"" way.

# The one person who kinda mattered

well, there **was** one girl that i kind of got along with actually, her name was kate. met her in high school, the only girl who was equally nerdy as i was. we talked about black butler, wind waker (the zelda game), and even just about each other's lives. but she always had this person who was much closer to her heart than i was. i was young and inexperienced with socializing, and i REALLY wanted that kind of best friendship. but clearly, kate would never give that to me. in fact, around senior year, there were moments where she'd just repeatedly leave me on read. and i don't think that's what a friend would do. i got upset about it, and called her out on it, but then kate's bestie, river, told me that the more i wanted kate's friendship, the less she was going to give it me. to me, that felt really fucking unfair. why do those two girls get to be besties? why couldn't I get along with other girls? kate never apologized for being cold towards me, but I mentally forgave her internally, so we continued to get along... or so I thought.

we continued to chat and hang out after high school, but it still felt like she was keeping her distance from me. i don't know why, it just felt like it. and then around 2022 or so, i cut her off from my life. i asked kate by SMS if she wanted to go to a cat cafe with me sometime, but she started to ignore me again, just like back in high school. it brought back those old fears and traumas. ""she doesn't give a shit about me"", ""she doesn't want to be friends with me"". even though i thought i had moved on from those beliefs, clearly i hadn't. so i called her out on it yet again, saying, ""okay, guess we're not going to the cat cafe after all"". sure, that was a bitchy move on my part, but the way she responded was so dismissive, saying, ""you're not the only one who has depression"". then she told me about how she had this online friend coming over from another country to hang out at her house. and that devastated me, yet again. she wasn't willing to hang out with me, whom she'd known for over 10 years, but was willing to socialize with another person? it felt like ashley, all over again. so i told her, ""You know what? I don't give a shit what you think about me anymore."" since then, not one peep from her, but i don't care. kate is effectively dead to me now.

# Conclusion

i could keep going on, but i think this thread is getting long enough as it is. i guess what I'm trying to say is: everyone keeps putting me at arm's length. people are constantly telling me flimsy excuses without making any attempts to reschedule. i don't know if I'm autistic, but i was diagnosed with inattentive adhd about, idk, 6-7 years ago. i think it does partly explain why i struggled so hard to make friends, especially during childhood and adolescence, but it doesn't change the fact that those little-t traumas added up over time, resulting in, well, the me that i am right now. i prefer close one-on-one friendships, but i also wouldn't mind a group of people who just... idk, genuinely loved me and wanted to do things with me.

i'll probably just be told that ""you can't change the past, so start putting in effort now"". but i already know that. and i have tried going to meetups and other things before; didn't work out.

i don't know.

i don't have a lot of hope left.

i'm not doing this for pity, sympathy, or upvotes. i just wanted to tell my story, because it fucking matters. the people who were isolated before, but found their people, and talk about how happy their lives are via podcasts or Medium posts? great for them. they deserve to have a voice too, but **so do I.**",11,1767742854.0,NEET,4,1.0,False

1q5yyar,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q5yyar,"Pregnant, Grieving, Abandoned… Now I’m Glowing, He’s Begging","Chapter 1


""Where are the oranges?""


11 PM. My husband finally walked through the door—empty-handed.


I was three months pregnant. For once, I actually had an appetite. He'd promised to grab my favorite oranges on his way home.


But now? Nothing.


We just stared at each other. It took him a few seconds to even register what I was asking.


""Oh, shit! I totally forgot! Babe, I'm so sorry—I was in surgery all day. My brain's fried.""


""I swear I'll get them tomorrow!""


I wasn't even mad. I told him it was fine.


But then I went to hang up his coat—and pulled a strawberry hair clip out of his pocket.


Callum's face went red.


""Oh, that. My junior resident's obsessed with that brand. She wouldn't stop bugging me to grab one when I passed by the store, so I just... picked it up.""


Here's the thing—I knew that store.


There was a fruit stand RIGHT NEXT TO IT—the one that sold my favorite oranges.


Something inside me snapped.


I turned around, voice calm.


""I think we should get a divorce.""


...


Callum froze. His expression hardened.


""What's your reason?""


I clutched the clip tighter.


""You didn't bring me oranges.""


""Are you serious right now?""


His face went dark in an instant. He pinched the bridge of his nose like I was giving him a migraine.


""Sloane, you're about to be a mother. When are you going to stop acting like a child?""


""Pregnant women are impossible. Fine, throw your tantrum. I'm not doing this.""


He yanked the clip out of my hand, grabbed his pillow, and stormed off to the study.


I stared at his retreating back, my chest aching with a dull, persistent pain.


That night, I went digging.


It didn't take long to find her—Ivy Winters, Callum's precious junior resident.


Her Instagram was a shrine to him.


\[My mentor acts all cold, but he's a softie. Complains about me every day, but still eats lunch with me without fail.\]


Attached: a photo of Callum, stone-faced, eating the fatty bits of meat she'd pushed off her plate.


Callum hated food waste. He'd lecture me if I so much as picked out a piece of ginger.


But with Ivy? Totally different guy.


\[Been so stressed lately I actually developed a breast lump. Thank God for my mentor.\]


Attached: a photo of Callum performing a breast exam on her.


The most recent post? One minute ago.


A screenshot of them on video chat. She was wearing a bunny girl outfit, swaying her hips.


\[Mentor got pissed off by some pregnant hag tonight, but I cheered him right up.\]


My stomach dropped.


So this was what he'd been doing behind my back.


This was how close they'd gotten.


The next morning.


Callum had the day off.


He came home early with a bag of oranges—big, round, perfect ones.


He peeled every single one and arranged them on a plate, then held a slice up to my lips.


""I didn't forget on purpose last night. I really was just swamped.""


""I know pregnancy makes you emotional, and I know you probably overthought everything. So I went out first thing this morning and got these. They're sweet. You're going to love them.""


I stared at the orange. It looked perfect. But made me want to throw up.


Suddenly, his phone buzzed.


Caller ID: ""Biggest Dummy.""


Sounded affectionate.


Whatever Ivy said made his face shift instantly—panic, clear as day.


He didn't ask. He told me.


""Ivy's being harassed by a patient. She's just a kid, she doesn't know how to handle this. I need to go.""


I grabbed his arm.


""She's at a hospital. There are security guards. Other doctors. She could call the cops. Why does she need someone else's husband?""


""And you promised. Today's my ultrasound. You said you'd come with me.""


He looked at me like I was a stranger.


""Sloane, how can you even say something that heartless? Ivy's my mentee. I'm responsible for her.""


With that, he pulled his arm free and walked out.


I watched him leave, suddenly remembering the day I told him I was pregnant. He'd cried. Actually cried.


He said the baby and I were his whole world.


Guess we weren't anymore.


Ten minutes later, Ivy posted again.


Location tag: Callum's office.


She was on her knees under his desk, wearing something barely there, her face flushed as she tugged at his zipper.


\[I lied about the harassment thing lol. Just wanted to reward my mentor.\]


I laughed. Actually laughed.


Then I called my best friend—the lawyer.


""Draw up a divorce agreement. I'm leaving Callum.""


Then I met her at a coffee shop.


When I told her everything, she went pale with rage and didn't stop cursing him out until I calmed her down.


She had the papers ready in minutes.


""Get him to sign ASAP. Also, I'm moving abroad in two weeks. Come with me.""


...


On the drive home.


A black sedan swerved into our lane out of nowhere.


Our driver yanked the wheel. We hit another car.


I slammed into the seat. A sharp pain tore through my stomach. Something warm pooled between my legs.


I couldn't even scream before everything went dark.


The last thing I saw: two people stepping out of that black sedan.


Callum sprinted toward me, hickeys blooming across his collarbone like accusations.


He grabbed me, voice breaking.


""Babe, stay with me! I'm getting you to the hospital!""


I couldn't answer.


Everything went black.


...


When I woke up, I was on an operating table. Callum was in scrubs, working frantically.


""Don't be scared. You and the baby are going to be fine. This'll be over soon.""


Ivy stood nearby, eyes red and brimming with tears.


""I'm so sorry. This is my fault. I distracted him while he was driving. I'm so, so sorry.""


""But don't worry—he's the best. You and the baby will be okay.""


I pictured them in that car. Together. My anger flared, but the anesthesia kept me silent.


Callum's hands were steady. The surgery went perfectly. The baby was safe.


But then, during the final stage—closing me up—Ivy, who was assisting, made a mistake.


A fatal one.


The instrument slipped. It tore through my abdomen.


Blood poured out, flooding the table.


Chapter 2


""Shit!""


Callum's face went white. He started emergency procedures immediately.


But it was too late. The baby was gone.


And I nearly died on that table.


...


When I came to, Callum was sitting beside me. Dark circles under his eyes. He clearly hadn't slept.


""The baby's gone, isn't it?""


Guilt flickered across his face. He gripped my hand hard.


""I'm so sorry. I couldn't save him. But please don't be sad—we can have another baby. What matters most is that you're okay.""


Ivy nodded eagerly beside him.


""Exactly. At least we saved your life. Please don't do anything reckless.""


I let out a cold laugh.


""What gives you the right to say that? You two killed my baby. I saw what you were doing in that car. I'm reporting both of you. You'll get exactly what you deserve.""


Their faces went pale.


Ivy dropped to her knees in front of me, sobbing.


""I'm so sorry. I know I messed up. Please don't report me—I'll lose my job!""


""I worked so hard to get here. Being a doctor is my only dream. If I lose that, I have nothing left to live for!""


Callum looked at her with so much concern it made me sick.


He turned to me, frowning.


""I already told you it was an accident. We didn't hit you on purpose. Do you really need to ruin her life over this?""


""It's not like you can never have kids again. Are you seriously going to destroy someone's entire future over a baby you never even met?""


Did he even remember? That baby was his too. He'd fought so hard to keep it safe.


I didn't bother answering. I turned over, facing away from them.


It didn't matter.


Anyway, soon, I'd be gone.


Ivy started crying harder. She actually fainted.


Callum panicked. He scooped her up in his arms and rushed out.


That night, Callum had me dragged out of the hospital and locked in the house.


He confiscated my phone, my laptop—everything. I wasn't allowed to leave.


He was afraid I'd report Ivy. Afraid I'd ruin her precious career.


""I was the one driving. If you want to blame someone, blame me. Ivy's innocent. She came from nothing—clawed her way out of poverty to get here. Don't destroy her because of us.""


But we both knew the truth.


With his influence, even a hundred complaints wouldn't touch him.


But still to keep me quiet, he forced sleeping pills down my throat. I spent days in a drugged haze.


Until one afternoon, I woke up to pain.


Sharp, stinging pain.


I opened my eyes.


Ivy was sitting beside me, holding my right hand. She was jabbing a needle into my skin. Over and over.


When she saw I was awake, she smiled sweetly.


""Oh, you're up! I have a skills test coming up, so I figured I'd practice on you. Sorry if it hurts.""


My hand was covered in blood.


I slapped her across the face.


The noise brought Callum running.


He saw the red mark on her cheek and turned on me, furious.


""Sloane! She came here to check on you, and you hit her?!""


I held up my hand, covered in needle marks.


""She did this to me. Why the hell wouldn't I hit her?""


Something flickered in his eyes—sympathy, maybe. But before he could say anything, Ivy burst into tears.


""I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you! I just need to pass my test—I swear I didn't mean it!""


Callum couldn't stand seeing her cry. He wiped her tears, voice soft.


""It's not your fault. Don't blame yourself.""


I was the one in pain. But he forgave her on my behalf.


I grabbed the vase off the table and hurled it at them.


""Get out! Both of you—GET OUT!""


Chapter 3


Callum dodged easily, pulling Ivy out of the way. He left the room and called over his shoulder to the guards outside.


""My wife's injured. Get the family doctor to bandage her up.""


He didn't come back that night.


I didn't care. I started packing.


Callum and I had known each other since we were kids.


Together since eighteen. Now twenty-eight. A decade of photos, gifts, memories.


I burned it all.


Four days later, he finally came home.


Drunk. Ivy was holding him up.


I was sitting on the couch, watching TV.


Ivy smirked at me.


""We were celebrating my passing the exam. He had a little too much to drink. Don't be mad.""


""Who's drunk?"" Callum slurred, pinning her against the wall. ""I could drink ten more.""


Ivy giggled, looking at me.


""Don't mind him. He always gets like this when he's drunk—""


""I don't mind.""


I cut her off, stood up, and went upstairs.


That night, I heard them. Moaning. Laughing.


I didn't react.


Ivy even sent me a selfie. Her neck was covered in hickeys.


""Don't get the wrong idea—he thought I was you. He sucked so hard, these are gonna take days to fade.""


I didn't reply.


The next day, my best friend texted me.


\[You packed? I booked a 3 PM flight. I'll pick you up soon.\]


I texted back: \[Ready.\]


Then I went to grab the jade pendant my parents left me—the one I kept in the safe for protection.


The safe was empty.


Panic hit me like a wave.


I ran downstairs.


Callum was in the kitchen, wearing an apron, cooking for Ivy.


She was lounging on the couch, legs crossed, watching TV.


Wearing my pendant.


I walked up to her, voice cold.


""Give me my pendant back.""


She frowned, clutching it.


""This? My mentor gave it to me. It's for good luck. I'm keeping it.""


I let out a bitter laugh.


""That's from my parents. He has no right to give it to you.""


Callum came over, looking guilty. Then defensive.


""Ivy's going to a training program next month. It's far away, and I'm worried about her. I just lent it to her. I'll give it back when she's home.""


Rage boiled over. I slapped him.


""You know how much this means to me. I never even wore it myself. How dare you give it to her?""


His expression darkened.


""It's just a pendant. Why are you being so petty? I said I'd give it back.""


Before I could respond, Ivy started crying.


""If it upsets you this much, fine. I don't want it.""


She took it off and held it out to me.


But just as I reached for it—she let go.


It hit the floor and shattered into pieces.


Ivy gasped, hand over her mouth.


""Oops. You should've caught it. Not my fault it broke.""


Her smug little face made me sick.


I slapped her. Hard.


Callum immediately stepped in front of her.


""Sloane, enough! You didn't catch it—that's why it broke. This has nothing to do with her. Apologize. Now.""


I smiled. Cold. Dangerous.


""Apologize? Sure. I'll apologize.""


I grabbed the vase off the table and smashed it over Ivy's head.


She screamed. Blood poured down her face.


Callum scrambled to stop the bleeding, wrapping her head in gauze.


I didn't even look at them. I picked up the shattered pieces of the pendant and went upstairs to grab my suitcase.


Callum called after me.


""Sloane—where are you going?""


I turned, emotionless, and threw the divorce papers in his face.


""Somewhere you're not.""


""We're done, Callum. I don't want you anymore.""

Most of the time things are really good, but we’ve had an issue since we began dating with his “jokes.” He’s the type that will make sassy comments as jokes… and I don’t like it. I always speak up for myself and he’s definitely cut back A LOT, but the other day he said something that offended me and now we’re in a weird spot. We had just woken up from a nap and were talking, he said “I love you!” I have to admit, I was not in a good headspace (dealing with some depression and anxiety, just started meds and therapy) and needed some reassurance, so I replied “do you?” and the conversation goes as follows; 
Him: “of course” and puts his hands up like he’s ranking things and “it goes; sleep, pizza, …” and then paused basically saying I came after sleep and pizza. 
Me: “heyyyyy stop.” 
Him: ”just kidding, it’s pizza then sleep… pause. 
Me: *gets serious* “hey I don’t like that!”
Him: “no, it’s sleep, sleep, sleep, pizza….” 
Me: “wtf that really hurt my feelings” and start crying. “I was literally telling you to stop, that’s so mean to say that!” 
He proceeds to say I’m right and he’s sorry. He holds my hand for a couple minutes as I’m crying. At one point, I go “that totally ruined my night.” More silence and just holding my hand. We’ve talked about this too, that sometimes I need more than just a hand hold, I need words to make me feel better. The whole time I’m just thinking, SAY SOMETHING!!!!! All of a sudden, he gets up and says “well sorry that ruined your night.” His face looked pissed off and he walks out. I’m totally shocked because we had another incident where he walked out after hurting my feelings because he didn’t “have the emotional capacity” to comfort me right now… and then he does it again. I was like, “you know sometimes I just wish you would comfort me” and no surprise, he’s like “I don’t have the energy right now” and I start bawling. 
I felt totally abandoned and brokenhearted. Sometimes he’s so emotionally connected and present and other times it feels like he doesn’t give a fuck. It’s been a little over 48 hours and we’re in this weird limbo… I’m usually the one to bring up heavy topics so I’m leaving it up to him. I need to see that he’ll step up to repair things. He’s done little things to ease the tension like getting me some banana pudding, showing me the shelves he put up with all the trinkets I’ve gotten him, and he continues to do our morning routine of coming to my side of the bed, saying I love you, and giving me a hug and a kiss before he goes to make his coffee, but no initiating the conversation that we need to have. I need to see that he can take the initiative. Is it immature/unhelpful to keep waiting for him to bring things up? I never thought I would be posting to Reddit, but this is my first real relationship so I need advice. All my friends are in shitty relationships so I don’t trust their opinions. 


TLDR: My boyfriend of 2 years has a history of making jokes that hurt my feelings. I have told him this and he’s definitely more mindful/doesn’t do it as much, but a couple of days ago he went too far and it made me cry. I told him that wasn’t cool and he was like “you’re right, I’m sorry” I asked for more comfort and he said he didn’t have the emotional capacity right now. This has also happened before. Now 48 hours later, things are awkward and despite his attempts to act normal and smooth things over, I want him to initiate a direct conversation about the issue. Is it immature/unhelpful to keep waiting for him to bring things up? I want to see that he can take initiative because that’s important to me.",0,1767741995.0,relationship_advice,37,0.25,False

- I had my baby 3 months ago and did not really get time off. I worked through my “maternity leave” I even worked on scheduling 8 hrs into labor because 2 people quit and they gave me two stores to manage while I was pregnant. I don’t feel like myself or look remotely like myself. I had to work because the leave would’ve been unpaid and that wasn’t feasible with a newborn.  

- In December I worked harder on my credit in two weeks than I have in 5 years. I had to suffer being broke hunting down collections so they wouldn’t tank my credit in the near future I shouldn’t have neglected stuff but I’m not smart. I plan to do better now. 

My coworker quit 30 minutes before his shift so I have the honor of working two 13 hour shifts back to back. Which means I don’t get to see my 3 month old son for 4 days straight. After my coworker came in and quit I got approved for the house I put in an offer for yesterday now it feels too good to be true. I don’t feel excited. I feel drained, like the hard part isn’t even over and I’m wearing myself deep to the bone. I train two new hires this week on top of it so I’m just at my limit all around.

**Potential ways to connect to a fic:**

As clay is such a versatile medium, there are a number of ways you can connect it to a fic. You can make a shaped slab with your favorite quote pressed or carved in, sculpt miniatures of characters or significant objects from the fic, make a clay diorama of a scene that really stuck out to you. Reading a coffee shop AU? Recreate the cafe’s mugs! Found a good Greek mythology AU? Make a Grecian urn depicting your favorite scenes. You can even make clay beads with engraved designs, or shaped like significant symbols from the fic for jewelry. If you’re using modeling chocolate, you can do any of the above and add it to a cake or other edible base - see our [culinary arts spotlight](https://fanartfrenzy.tumblr.com/post/802926795677679617/art-type-spotlight-culinary-arts-cooking) for more edible ideas.

**Examples:**

Figurines, either on their own or as part of a diorama, are a great option, like this super cute [Spy X Family figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7o5EM7co2E) made with air dry clay, or these [clay demodogs from Stranger Things](https://www.tumblr.com/butchbarbie-psd/804282793154707456/felt-like-this-might-be-a-good-time-to-show-yall). Epoxy clay is another option for smaller sculpts, especially if you’re looking for a harder set. This kind of clay is ideal for jewelry or other small objects, like this [Warhammer 40k helmet](https://www.reddit.com/r/clay/comments/1pgws36/warhammer_40k_helmet/).

Polymer clay can be a great option for making little scenes and objects, like this [dragon scene](https://www.reddit.com/r/polymerclay/comments/1ofulfi/i_made_a_scene_with_a_little_guardian_dragon/) by Azuraroselion, or this recreation of the iconic [birthday cake](https://www.reddit.com/r/polymerclay/comments/o94e1v/made_auroras_birthday_cake_from_the_disneys/) from Sleeping Beauty by tiffanyscreations. You can even use clay to make jewelry, like these adorable [Kermit the Frog earrings](https://www.reddit.com/r/polymerclay/comments/1mllzzk/my_hand_sculpted_kermit_the_frog_earrings/) made by bird\_hands, or this [Supernatural](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernatural/comments/1fm0zzo/my_sister_made_this_out_of_clay_for_my_birthday/) necklace. 

If you’re using ceramic clay, you can make usable mugs and tea cups (or bowls, plates, saucers, etc.) like these [Lord of the Rings mugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/1gbejl9/wanted_to_share_some_lotrinspired_mugs_i_made/), as well as vases, urns, jars, and more.

You can also use clay to make traditional sculptures and busts. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wO9DjJbJnw) by the Laughing Gargoyle shows the full process of sculpting a seriously impressive Solid Snake bust, including some paint troubleshooting which you may find helpful. 

**Resources, tutorials, and where to look for inspiration:**

The easiest and generally cheapest type of clay to work with is air dry clays, some of which can be made at home with basic household materials. Air dry clays do exactly what it says on the tin - dry in the open air, no baking necessary, just a little time. There are many different varieties of air dry clay, and some may work better for you than others depending on what you’re looking to make. This in-depth [guide to air dry clays](http://www.craftionary.net/air-dry-clay-guide/) will walk you through the different types available and what kinds of projects each is best suited to, along with tips, tricks, and instructions for getting started.

If you’re new to clay, baking soda clay is a good air dry option to start with. All you need is baking soda, cornstarch, and water. Check out [this tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Baking-Soda-Clay-Easy-Air-Dry-Recipe/) for a recipe and some project ideas. Baking soda clay can be used to make basically anything other kinds of clay can be used for, though it won’t be as strong or sturdy. 

Both air dry and baked clays are great options for smaller objects and for recreating scenes in dioramas (see our [diorama spotlight](https://fanartfrenzy.tumblr.com/post/802035840835567616/art-type-spotlight-dioramas) for additional ideas and resources). Not sure which type of clay is right for your project? Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdUMksMCEx0) for a detailed comparison of air dry and polymer clays.

Polymer clay and other home-bakeable clays are great for miniatures and other small projects. If you’re looking to make something small - jewelry, characters, objects from the fic, or recreating scenes in a diorama, polymer clay is a good choice. If you’ve never used polymer clay before, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnfh7cydAkA) (with an emphasis on miniatures) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adSDvgTtY8Q) (with an emphasis on jewelry) are both good starting points. The Youtube channel [I the Crafter](https://www.youtube.com/@ithecrafter) also has many detailed tutorials and guides great for both beginners and experienced sculptors, including [this fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShLj6_5RXHg) that details common mistakes beginners make and how to avoid them, and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU-yXvDWpwY) comparing the various polymer clay brands. There are many tutorials available for making almost anything out of polymer clay, like this one for [making a clay garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOYCyf4mf5Y), and this one for [miniature pies](https://www.instructables.com/Ingredients-5/), and this one for a super cute [macaron bracelet](https://www.instructables.com/Pastel-Rainbow-Macaron-Polymer-Clay-Bracelet/).

For edible projects, modeling chocolate is a great clay-like option you can use to make delicious and attractive-looking art. This can be made either with real chocolate or candy melts, depending on your budget. Check out King Arthur Baking’s guide and recipe [here](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/06/02/modeling-chocolate-for-cake-decorating), and this very thorough [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzhVM_dcyPw). Once you have your modelling chocolate, you can use many of the usual clay techniques detailed in the tutorials linked above for shaping, carving, and sculpting whatever you need to make.

For larger projects, or anything you’d like to make food safe, ceramic clay is your best option. This can also be the most complicated and expensive, unfortunately, but there are ways to make it easier and more affordable - see our notes on equipment and other resources below. If you’re not sure if this is the right choice for you or your projects, check out this [overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EP6JX6RhAg). For a more detailed look, or if you’ve never worked with this kind of clay before, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkjNbTCFY1Q). From there, this [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbC14Txh1KZdaX5DkYYX8BBF3j9Bowhce) covers almost everything you need to know in terms of technique and how to use a pottery wheel.

If you already know a bit about clay or have worked with it before, I highly recommend checking out PotterytothePeople on youtube for excellent, detailed tutorials and tips for traditional clay work and pottery. [This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2uyQAZjeE) for a footed mug is a great place to start. 

For traditional clay work, you may need extra equipment like a pottery wheel and a kiln to fire your pottery or other clay projects. These are generally too expensive and inconvenient for most hobbyists to own, but there are many ways to access them for one-time use or for a few projects. [KilnShare](https://www.kilnshare.com/) has an extensive map of kiln owners willing to rent out or share their kilns with fellow potters - just zoom in on your location on the map to find a nearby kiln. If you’re in school or at university, your art teachers or art departments likely have studio space, pottery wheels, and a kiln which you can arrange to use. Your local library may also have a kiln available for patrons, like the [Warren County Library](https://warrenpl.org/pottery/). Community centers and art centers in your area likely also have pottery facilities and kilns that you may be able to use - they may also have courses available during which you can make your projects for this event with the help of an expert. If you’re completely new to clay and want to go the traditional route, I highly recommend this option. If you’re not sure where to look for courses, studio spaces, or a kiln in your area, try [Find a Pottery Class](https://findapotteryclass.com/find-studios/) \- just enter your zipcode and use the filters to find a nearby pottery studio to suit your needs. These and a few other kiln-sourcing options and firing tips are covered in this excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV4QLrpYgYk) by PotterytothePeople.

For help, support, and  troubleshooting, as well as ideas and inspiration, check out the many clay-related subreddits. For any kind of clay, [r/clay](https://www.reddit.com/r/clay) and [r/crafts](https://www.reddit.com/r/crafts/) are great resources. For miniatures and polymer clay, check out [r/miniaturesculpting](https://www.reddit.com/r/miniaturesculpting) and [r/polymerclay](https://www.reddit.com/r/polymerclay), and for pottery,  [r/pottery](https://www.reddit.com/r/pottery) is the place to go. 

As with any craft project, [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) is a great place to look for inspiration and detailed project tutorials - search for the specific thing you want to make or browse by category to get some ideas.

For more detailed instruction, never underestimate your local library. There are many excellent books written about clay and sculpture that can be acquired quickly and for free in physical or ebook form. Librarians are your friends and will not bite you - ask them for help in finding books and resources! Many libraries in larger cities offer additional resources such as clay firing, as mentioned above, or a ‘library of things’ where you can rent tools and crafting equipment, like the [Harris-Elmore Library](https://www.harriselmorelibrary.org/library-of-things-items/mini-pottery-wheel) in Ohio, or the [Bayside Library](https://bayside.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/OPAC/BIBENQ/302844408/30201279,3) in Australia.

**What to avoid:** 

Be very careful on pinterest, tiktok, and youtube shorts - avoid ‘5 minute crafts’ style “whoa, it really works!” videos and other clickbait-y content designed to trick you. Many of these videos are deliberately short, sped-up, feature deceptive cuts, and recommend techniques that are both ineffective and potentially dangerous. These are often made by content farms, not individuals, and their goal is clicks and views, not to help people make anything real. When looking for instructional content, look for guides and videos made by dedicated individuals. A good tutorial will usually be longer, include lists of materials and resources, and show the full process with tips and tricks to ensure your success.

**Additional notes:** 

Be sure to follow any safety guidelines listed on materials such as clay, glue, resin, and paints. Use recommended protective equipment such as masks, gloves, and safety glasses. Work in a well-ventilated area and don’t use hazardous materials in ways not recommended on the packaging. Be very careful with any blades and other sharp equipment, and anything involving heat or fire. When using a kiln or baking clay in an oven, be mindful of the heat and follow all safety instructions. In the case of polymer clay, don’t bake at higher temperatures than recommended on the packaging - use an oven thermometer to make sure your oven doesn’t run hot. If you’re on the younger side, get an adult to help!

I yawn every day, multiple times a day, regardless of how much I sleep or how long I’ve been awake. My psychiatrist believes it’s connected to my insomnia or heart condition that I take medication for, but nothing is for certain; even if I’m not exhausted, I’m yawning. 

I’ve read multiple blogs about teacher discipline when students are yawning or sleeping, and to be so honest, I’m more worried about myself. I take medication to help me sleep, and it’s quite literally the only way I can. I’m just concerned about how my yawning will be perceived by students and other faculty, and wanted to see if anyone had similar issues or possible solutions, even if this is a stupid problem. 

I don’t want my students to think I’m uninterested, because I’m very passionate about my subject and encouraging critical thinking. I’m equally worried about the reaction that other teachers and staff members will have considering none of my host teachers had this problem. 

I can’t use energy drinks or coffee, and I shouldn’t really have over 100mg of caffeine due to my heart issues. I get heart palpitations and tremors just from a can of Diet Coke, and I’d hate for my students to deal with my anxiety spikes.

Coffee tech has come a long way, but at the end of the day, it's all about that perfect flavor.

Here are my top picks for this year:

1. The Reliable Classic: Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV Select

If you just want the best-tasting drip coffee, this is still the king. It’s handmade, built like a tank, and gets the water temperature exactly right every single time. Plus, it looks great on any countertop.

2. The All-Rounder: Ninja Luxe Café Premier

This is for the person who wants it all Espresso, Drip, and Cold Brew. It has a built-in grinder and a smart milk frother that makes cafe-quality foam automatically. It’s basically a barista in your kitchen.

3. The Smart Choice: Fellow Aiden Precision Brewer

For the tech lovers! You can control this one from your phone, and it has specific ""profiles"" for different types of beans. It’s incredibly precise and looks very sleek and modern.

Quick Tip: If you're on a budget, the AeroPress is still the most underrated and cheapest way to get a world-class cup of coffee at home.

1q5yehy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q5yehy/i_24m_am_struggling_greatly_within_myself_even/,I (24m) am struggling greatly within myself even though I am in a great relationship with my current girlfriend (24f) because of an old relationship (23f),"So, pretty much just fishing for opinions here to see have others experienced this, and if so what the right move is.

So pretty much, my ex (23f) and I had an okay relationship with typical fighting that you would do when getting into a first “proper” relationship when we were younger (17-20) and were together about 3 years or so. The thing is, i truly felt deeply in love with her within my heart and we didn’t end a typically terrible way we just had scenarios come up that split us apart and then haven’t spoken pretty much since (so 3 years ago) and in between this time, about a year and a half ago me and my current girlfriend got together and I do love her. We have moved in together and have been moved in for about 4 months now and all has been good and we really get along and I’m genuinely happy with her

However, about a month ago I saw my ex girlfriend driving around and just glimpsed at her and got butterflies in my stomach and my heart throbbing and all that sort of stuff and ever since then I just catch myself thinking a lot about how well we got on and how we were really well matched and that love struck feeling has got me worried because I do still love my current girlfriend and she is genuinely such a nice and good person, but I’m just struggling greatly with catching myself thinking about my ex and even dreaming about her to then wake up to my girlfriend.

Then, after this, I sort of go down a spiral of feeling bad about feeling this way when it’s directed towards another woman because I am still adamant that I am in a great relationship, I just feel as if I am in one of those “the heart wants what the heart wants” sort of situations but while still loving my girlfriend for who she is, but again, on the other side, dreaming of my ex. And when I say dreaming I literally mean, last night, I had a dream about her. It’s really messing me up.. especially because I wake up in the same bed as my girlfriend thinking about my ex girlfriend.

So, if I can get a bit of advice on how to maybe change my mindset around this or just hear about peoples experiences that may be similar, that would be greatly appreciated.

Just as a + to see if this is an absolute no go or if it could sort my problem, I have been thinking about giving my ex a text to meet up for a coffee to talk to hopefully hear that our time is over or that maybe she feels the same way or just to know if a similar thing is happening but in no way would I want to go behind my current girlfriends back and do that. Although I don’t view it as cheating just meeting for a coffee or something, I just wouldn’t meet an ex girlfriend behind her back so I don’t know how to go about the situation so any opinions would be good.

Thank you for anybody who has advice and is willing to share, greatly appreciated.

TL:DR, I (24m) still feel like my heart loves my ex girlfriend (23f) even though I am in a great relationship with my current girlfriend (24f)",1,1767741109.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

It is so frustrating when I am trying my best and have come such a long way mentally to have so much riding on gaining weight - I know this is for my safety and I am accepting my team will just have my best interests at heart but I think the unknown of how it will go is really getting to me. Particularly when I have dad in my ear telling me one minute I will be fine, I am doing well etc then the next I will be sectioned and need to be prepared for a nightmare appointment. Also that I need to be in and out asap. I was chatting with my granny earlier and we both agreed what will be will and 'such is life'. 

Also got a little frustrated with myself today because I was like why can't I just eat everything, why can't I just eat what I want, when I want? Especially when I have so many things riding on gaining weight, which ultimately I have to eat for. But accepting, I am unwell, I have an ED - I am doing the best I can. I want a sustainable recovery, that I can mentally and physically manage. If I did go 'all in' I think I would last a week before I would freak and probably rebound 10x harder.  I have accepted, given the circumstances, slow and steady, but challenges and consistency is the way to go (and hopefully it will show in my appointment)! 

Today work was busy, I reached out to dad for support this morning to which I received 'whats done is done' and whilst I know that is true and I can't rely on others to make me feel good, sometimes it would be nice to have some in person support and recognition of my efforts. I did then phone my granny and she was much more helpful, so was my sister! So focusing on what they said not my dad. Manifesting positive vibes for tomorrow! Hope you all are well!

I can't explain why does it bother me so much. Maybe because English isn't my first language I pick up all little wrong things that I see. I know it's probably ridiculous getting so worked up about it but it truly annoys me. ",4,1767740746.0,CharacterAI,11,0.75,False
