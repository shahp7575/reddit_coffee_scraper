1fyyd3d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fyyd3d,I made the belt,"The literal exact moment that u/Araphia sent me pictures of her [fucking gorgeous Astarion dress](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyFangsbg3/s/J7v2s1PqTM) when it was completed, I knew I had to make this belt for her. 

I'm... actually unusually pleased with how this turned out. There were many points at which I was convinced I'd ruined it and was ready to throw it out the window, but I'm finally starting to come around to the fact that that's just kind of part of the creative process. 

The deets, for those masochistic enough to be curious: 

This is a 3/4in vegtan leather strap. I designed and 3D printed stamps for the decorative tabs and to use as a stencil for the detailing. Once I got the stamps where I wanted them, I was able to cut the design into the strap and begin the painstaking process of tooling it out. It was even more finicky than I'd anticipated, lol, and I ended up having to buy the tiniest damn tool I could find - 1.2mm. I do have a bit of experience in leatherworking, but not much in tooling specifically so that was definitely new for me. The design, I'm pretty sure, would be trivial for someone who knows what they're doing, but uh. I am not that, so it was not that. 

Everything was dyed with Angelus leather dyes, in a 1:1:50 ratio of Honey: Coffee: isopropyl alcohol. All edges on the straps and tabs were finished with sandpaper up to 1500 grit then burnished with beeswax, even though I'm pretty sure that was unnecessary for literally all parts of this lol. The tabs were sealed with neatsfoot oil and the strap was finished with resolene because the bottle was physically closer to me when I was doing that part and I didn't realize until the first coat was done. Sigh. 

I also started digging into metalworking a teeeeeny tiny bit, which is something I've been eager to do for ages. I found an [STL for the buckle](https://dangerousladies.ca/products/astarions-belt-buckles-3d-print-files?pr_prod_strat=pinned&pr_rec_id=7bf975e3a&pr_rec_pid=8662950805821&pr_ref_pid=8662641148221&pr_seq=uniform) (this shop is an embarrassment of riches, crafty folks - they even have machine embroidery files for Astarion’s armor if you, like me, aren't as talented as some who can do it by hand!) but I knew that painted resin just wasn't gonna be it for me. The weight was all wrong! So I got a lil tiny foundry, some high-temp silicone to cast molds into, and some pewter, and we made it happen. Eventually. This is a very persnickety process, as it turns out. Hopefully we'll continue to improve and I'll get to come here and show off some jewelry in a few months' time! 

The most interesting feature, I think, is that this belt expands! Video game characters are not beholden to physics, and vampires are not unduly concerned with weight fluctuations, which might be why the design of this belt doesn't have any godsdamned way to size it up or down. But it's being made for a human person who should be allowed to eat and breathe, so it needed to allow for at least a little wiggle room! Hidden inside of six of the eight tabs, the belt is actually cut and each end is stitched to a piece of heavy-duty elastic. Each one only allows for maybe half an inch of additional stretch, but spread over six of those tabs it actually has quite a bit of give! Hopefully that way it will still be comfy after a big meal, or when worn over a garment with more bulk to it. It's, uh. It's maybe not the most simple or efficient answer to this problem, but it seems to be effective! 

I'm not 100% happy with the connection points on the hardware, they're certainly not sturdy enough for daily use, but I'm hopeful that everything will work well for the occasional wear that I think is likely for this. As always, there are approximately twelve million things I wish I'd done differently, but that's how we learn and all that, right? 

Thank you for reading my brief novella about that one time that I made a belt! Would love to hear your thoughts, awkwardly sidestep your praise, and see what y'all are working on :)

u/Araphia, ready yourself, girl, the belt is hitting the post office this afternoon! I can't wait to see it all together 💙",1,1728389849.0,OnlyFangsbg3,0,1.0,False

1-Wanting to be a parent is inherently selfish. You want to carry a baby, you want to see your DNA in another person etc..is all for you, not for the child (also let me point out, the fact that your doctor said it’s a bad idea to have another baby due to your post birth complications yet you’re risking Matilda’s mother for another baby is extremely selfish) 

2-you take M to Disney constantly because you said that’s the childhood you wanted. But recently you said she is shy. Do you think maybe she doesn’t completely like Disney? Maybe she would prefer calmer situations? But because that’s where you wanted to be that’s where you drag her day after day.

3-your child has not had consistent sleep in her life because you don’t want to put the effort to establish a schedule. And I get not wanting to be in the house all day, but even just taking time to step away while you’re out, get her some quiet to have a consistent nap instead of always expecting her to just fall asleep wherever can make a world of difference. You force her into your life instead of acknowledging she’s a new person with different needs.

4-that child does not have a baby friendly social life. She doesn’t go places that might stimulate her mind as a baby. She doesn’t go to story times, children’s museums, parks. She goes shopping, she goes to coffee shops etc. Those places are for you, not for her.

I just wanna ask advise   
So I (27M) had a happy crush on (26M) and is now spiraling down to this feeling of wanting more than a happy crush.  
  
I met him through an IG story from a close friend of mine and he had me introduce myself to him which I did and ever since then we've been exchanging and interacting with each other till this day.  
  
He is not perfect and still has a lot of baggage that I will not disclose but I can say is I sympathize with him, since I went through the same hell just on different roads but I mean in this day and age who hasn't experience that before ? plus I can see the effort he is putting in making himself better again which I love.  
  
We have a lot of common denominators and he is really a joy to talk and be with, I feel light whenever I talk to him and can always feel at ease. I just don't know if he also feels the same... So in a few weeks we are planning to meet each other for the first time and I'm planning to make my move .. it may sound outdated but I plan on giving him a flower like the one in beauty and the beast and a love letter and since we both play genshin impact I also plan on giving him visions as well, its my late bday gifts to him and my attempt on confessing my feelings for him but I am hesitant and losing conviction to do so ... Because yesterday he went on a random coffee date with someone although we did talk of how it went he said he wasn't sure because of the age gap so it kind of gave me hope that I still may have a chance but it seems he is willing to try nonetheless ? Not 100% sure on what he's planning or thinking but the uncertainty of things is making me doubt ... I still wanna give it a shot and see where it goes cuz we have already established a bond but I'm also scared of the thought of being rejected and losing him.  
  
I've been inhaling copium since then and been telling myself if it didn't work at least I tried, at least I manage to put my feelings out there again but deep down I'm hoping and wishing that it was me ... praying that it could be me.  
  
Should I still confess and give it a shot despite the odds or should I just stay quiet and support him and admire him from a far ?",1,1728389718.0,phlgbt,0,1.0,False

I see yet another urologist next week for a second opinion. I've had a cystoscopy done to look for the source of the blood in my urine but nothing could be found. I was told just to drink water and take OAB meds.

Well, things were fine for a while, minus the blood in the urine, no real symptoms until last year. They just exploded out of nowhere: urgency, constantly feeling the need to go, squeezing/pressure, leakage (I wear period panties or pantyliners/pads daily), never feeling empty, etc. No real sharp/burning pain, thankfully. Saw my GP who gave me Myrbetriq 25mg which helped some but I didn't find real relief until 50mg.

Except lately, it seems like it's worse when I take it? For the past several days, I have been seeing a huge uptick in symptoms. Or maybe it's wearing off and is no longer effective? But strangely enough, when I don't take the Myrbetriq on the weekends, it seems better. Idk if that's because I'm not drinking as much or not moving around as much, idk. I can usually wear normal panties on the weekend with minimal issue. But I feel like I probably drink about the same amount as I do at work, maybe even more.

What is going on here? Of course I'll bring this up to my new doctor but just wondered if anyone had a similar experience. I will admit, I'm not doing the proper IC diet because I already have several other chronic illnesses that leave me feeling exhausted and fatigued and I'm already doing what I can for them. So, caffeine is a must at work. But I drink one travel mug of coffee in the morning, water, and then usually a can of soda at lunch, followed by more water.

1fyybgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonwenclairfans/comments/1fyybgl/wednesday_addams_character_analysis_part_2/,Wednesday Addams Character Analysis Part 2,"
Part 1 of the analysis: https://www.reddit.com/r/Wednesday/s/VjmZBnsloC

How many parts total? Atleast 3 however part 3 is not written yet.


Wednesday starting to giving a fuck about those around her is another driving part of how we see Wednesday change over the course of the first season. Her relationships with Thing, Enid, and Tyler are where we see her main evolution. Eugene also to a certain extent, but him being attacked influences her the most.

When we first meet Wednesday, she is very distrusting, cold, and independent. She distrusts her parents, Weems, Dr Kinbott, and the sheriff. She plans to escape and never see her parents again. We got some development on this from parents’ weekend. It seems more that her distrust is more focused on her mother. When her father apologizes for ‘not being a good father she gives him many examples of how he did an adequate job and how he helped make her independent and true to herself. I am excited to get more information about her relationship with her mother in the next season. There seems to be some resentment there. She doesn’t want to live in her shadow. She doesn’t seem to value motherhood and has a hard time with positive emotions. She doesn’t understand love and aspires to do more with her life than be a house wife. We don’t get much regarding this, but I wouldn’t be surprised if she thinks her mother wasted her talents becoming a mother and housewife. 
Thing she forces to pledge his undying loyalty when she discovers him at Nevermore. She trusts him as an ally though is very hard on him in failure. I would be interested to know what her relationship with Thing was prior to this. She does truly care for him. She is very brazen with him. However, she cries and does not give up when he is stabbed. She also declares revenge must be sought. Thing also influences her relationship with her other main relationships.

I think one reason why the friendship anamoly between End and Wednesday works because of Thing. Enid wanted a bestie and someone to bond with so she wormed her way into Wednesday’s life. There may be some sort of preconceived notion about dorm roommates. Thornhill made a comment about making connections you normally wouldn’t is part of the dorm experience. And that they can turn into life long bonds. Thing serves as the person who can do the things with Enid that Wednesday cannot stand: shopping, manicures, etc. Enid also seems much less secure in who she is (atleast in the start of the series). Wednesday helps her gain confidence. Enid in turn shows Wednesday loyalty and acceptance. When Wednesday wanted to go to the Gates mansion when the school was on lockdown, she tricks Enid into helping her get out of the school. At this point, she is more obsessed with the Gates mansion mystery and being out maneuvered by the killer and care for the safety of her friends isn’t as present. But she is sad that she drives Enid away. They way that they act during their fight shows they care, but are being petty. A last note on Wednesday and Enid: Wednesday telling her about Nero and why she doesn’t cry seems out of place. But it does show that even in the beginning she has some trust or connection with Enid even then. Enid showed a vulnerability to Wednesday so Wednesday returned with one in kind. I think this is a great example of Wednesday having emotions and showing that she puts on a front to a certain extent. That she does have some deep cares and has feelings. She isn’t as 2D as she seems to want people to think and she is using defense mechanisms as guessed by Kinbott (But that also isn’t 100% of what is going on either). 

The other character that seems to get Wednesday to bring down some of her walls is Tyler. Whether you like the love interest storyline or not with him, she was still compelled to be around him and allowed more than a “business” relationship.
When she first meets Tyler, he is combative with her. He is stressed trying to figure out the espresso machine, she essentially questions his competence (assuming he doens’t know what a quad is) and he returns with more banter. He softens as she questions him and adds details about herself. I think Wednesday likes seeing people’s reactions to her odd hobbies and interests (the comment to Thornhill about secretly enjoying that other people think she is weird). He gives a ‘okay cool’ reaction and then moves on. She offers up her name when he asks: which could have been a product of banter and him being a smart ass so she does what he doesn’t expect and gives it. He offers to help which she accepts (she is getting a coffee and a ride out of her fixing the coffee machine. The look on her face seems to show some respect for him as he cannot be bought. In the first episode Tyler just seems to take in who she is and is curious about her. Through out many episodes we see comrodery between the two of them: wanting to leave Jericho, being in court ordered therapy, his dad being difficult, sharing why they are in court ordered therapy. He also seeks her out which is what is required to be in Wednesday’s life: people need to worm their way in. He seeks out Gomez’s police file and gives it to her and she responds that she is not used to people engaging with her. Kind of showing vulnerability and that there is more to her than the front that she puts up of not caring. There are many instances with Tyler where she normally would have not continued the conversation or shown vulnerability with others that she does. 
	• When Eugene suggested they go to the dance together, she was horrified and said no instantly
	• When Xavier figured out why she asked him to the dance, all he gets is a ‘it’s nothing personal’
	• When Wednesday and Xavier are talking about his proximity to the monster she tells him “for some reason I cannot fathom or indulge you seem to like me”
	• When Kinbott tries to talk to her about the Rave’N she asks if she is required to answer her questions outside of their sessions.
With Tyler, she banters with him (episode 3): eating Girl Scouts for breakfast (and throwing in for good measure the comment about an uncle to see his reaction. Episode 4, she warns him about his dad and offers up information about the dance that led to more conversation and confrontation. Her excuse to him on not knowing her feelings towards him was priority not, nah we are just friends. Which I feel like with other people she would have been blunt about. This is where her not liking positive emotions comes in to play and feeling that others will disappoint you and hating vulnerability comes into play. There was something going on there but she didn’t want to address it because she was uncomfortable with the new emotions she was feeling. I think she could have recognized what that feeling was (as she mention having a first crush in a writer/philosopher). But she doesn’t like those emotions (like the conversation with her father on how he is a good father) so she deflects and tries to move away from those. You could maybe argue that she wanted to keep Tyler as a resource however, she would likely just move on and try to find another way to obtain information. She is resourceful and does view people as expendable to a certain extent. She does says she prefers self reliance and being an island. Other examples of why I think she cares for Tyler:
	• When he shows up for the dance, she doesn’t tell him everything was Thing’s doing. She instantly forgot about Eugene and focused on him
	• She was looking at him almost the entire time of her dancing to Goo Goo Muc and allowed him in her orbit. Depending on what she was doing she allowed him to be closer to her and when he got confused where she went she tapped his shoulder to get his attention
	• She started ghosting him after Eugene got hurt: she didn’t want to hurt him
	• Tricking him in to taking her to the Gates mansion is where her obsession overrode her care in that moment. However, she did go back for him, she patched him up, and she tried to stay away and not get Tyler in trouble.
	• She seems thrown off when Xavier tells her about Tyler assaulting him. I think this is where her moral compass comes in. If she thought Tyler was motivated by hate for outcasts, they would have had a very different conversation. She also doesn’t refute him comment about “I knew there was a reason I liked you”
	• Wednesday doesn’t want to “owe’ anyone anything and generally doesn’t feel she owes anyone anything. She hated that Xavier saved her from the Gargoyle. She didn’t want him to save her so she didn’t owe him anything, With Tyler and the date, he was able to tell her she owed him and she took it (small protest but definitely not with the same out of vigor you would expect from her)
	• She warned him how she could hurt him if they became more than friends (which is ironic when he is found to be the hyde). But if she hadn’t wanted to kiss him, she would have stayed stiff.. But when he moved in to kiss her in the crypt, she moved in in return. She also described their date as ‘interrupted’  implying that she had wanted to kiss him as there was something missing
	• She enjoyed the date in the crypt. (Her facial expressions, “that was torture, thank you”
	• She was so betrayed when she found out he was the Hyde. The fact that she was tricked and ‘lost’ is part of it. But she put trust in him and was vulnerable with him that she is very guarded against. She is rash and lets her negative emotions take over (kidnapping and torture). Was that only part of it, likely yes. She didn’t trust Weems or the sheriff, thought Kinbott was Laurel. And when she tried to talk to Weems about Kinbott, Kinbott was in her office so that likely caused come hesitancy on whether she could trust Weems with her theory. She was motivated by revenge. Honestly, I think her reaction to him being the Hyde would have been very different had she found out prior to Eugene getting attacked.
	• She smiled when she kissed him and was active in the kiss (he pushed into her and she pushed back)


A note on friendships and love interests for Wednesday:

I am guessing that the writers did intend for Wednesday to fall for Tyler. That was how him being the Hyde was actually impactful to her. Otherwise, it would have just been the feeling of I’m wrong.

Growth from being an island is one of the major character developments we see from Wednesday so while some don’t like that she had love interests I thought it was fine. I don’t really see how it is different someone pursing a friendship with her vs a romantic relationship with her.  I think that from an outside view, close friendships and romantic relationships can look similar. It is all about how the people in those relationships define them and feel. Which we all know Wednesday is bad with non-negative emotions. As I said before: people have to worm their way into Wednesday’s life. She is going to resist, however Enid, Tyler and thing were insistent on being in her life. If they hadn’t, she would have stayed an island. I feel like Enid’s character needs more development time in season 2 which is likely because she is Wednesday’s bestie and her wolfing out and fighting the Hyde really solidified her and Wednesday’s bond.. While Tyler is seemingly the enemy at this point, I hope they spend more time on his connections into the overall world. Because he has so many tie ins (especially with the potential for world building), I hope he stays an important character, but since this is Wednesday, he will need to stay relevant to Wednesday (whether that is redemption to love interest, friend, or somehow frenemy)

When it comes to romantic and/or platonic feelings, logic really doesn’t work. Wednesday is very rooted in logic. So navigating any sort of relationship is uncharted territory for her. I think this is why her having a love interest is criticized because you aren’t going to see the normal teen reactions to things (think Enid vs the subtle changes you see in Wednesday’s face.) The subtlety of Wednesday leave open different interpretations and storylines for the writers to take so they can naturally grow the character as we move along in the story. 
 
I am not even going to try to make a guess on Wednesday’s sexuality. That is for the writers and the character to show us if they even want to put a definition to it. Based upon how they have developed her character so far, the road is open to what happens naturally in the story and can change based upon different experiences. I firmly believe Wednesday did fall for Tyler: but where she develops going forward is tbd. 

And by no means does her caring for SOME people make her soft. She believed that being close with anyone is a weakness and has semi had that come true. So we will see where she is after some time away from Nevermore. My assessment of her alignment is that she is chaotic neutral. The chaotic part I feel is an easy assessment: she definitely does not follow the law and is not above murder (Attempted murder charges would just make her seem incompetent)

# What are smoothies?

Smoothies are thick, creamy beverages usually blended from puréed fruits, vegetables, juices, yogurt, nuts, seeds, and/or dairy or nondairy milk.

Many smoothies include frozen produce or ice cubes to give the final product the cool, icy consistency of a milkshake. However, their flavor profiles vary tremendously depending on the ingredients. Why is the Smoothie Diet so effective?

The most basic smoothie starts with two essential ingredients — a base and a liquid. From there, you can combine ingredients to your liking.

Weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise. This Smoothie Diet cuts out all the awful foods that are making you gain weight while boosting your metabolism, cutting your cravings, and reducing your caloric intake (without ever leaving you hungry). Plus, the Smoothie Diet is insanely convenient. Convenience is the single biggest factor that leads to diet success or failure. If something is hard, you’re unlikely to stick with it. If it’s a breeze, then why wouldn’t you follow through?

[ **Grab Your Smoothie Diet Program Now at a Special Discount! >>**](https://tinyurl.com/5b6av9a4)

The best thing about the [***Smoothie Diet***](https://tinyurl.com/5b6av9a4) is that it helps you KEEP LOSING WEIGHT even after the 21 days are over. Many of Drew’s clients choose to swap out one meal per day with a smoothie for a few more weeks or months. And since it’s already a habit and you already love the smoothies, it’s easy to keep going until you hit your goal weight.

# Can we Lose Weight with Smoothies Diet plans?

Smoothies are an increasingly popular wellness trend and are frequently marketed as a health food.

These versatile beverages are portable, family-friendly, and modifiable for any taste or dietary preference. ***Smoothies*** are easy to prepare yourself, but you can also purchase fresh or bottled ones from specialty cafés and most major grocery stores.

While some types are loaded with veggies and fruit, others pack sugar or other unhealthy ingredients. As such, you may wonder whether they’re a healthy choice. This article explains everything you need to know about smoothies, including their potential health benefits and downsides, whether they aid weight loss and tips for making nutritionally balanced versions at home.

[***Take this 21-Day smoothie diet challenge***](https://tinyurl.com/5b6av9a4)*>>*

# Do smoothies aid weight loss?

Smoothies are frequently marketed as a weight loss tool. Research suggests they may be effective for this purpose as long as they’re not causing you to exceed your daily calorie needs. While some people find smoothies an easy way to monitor food portions and stay on top of their  
weight loss goals, others may not feel as full when they drink their calories rather than eating them.

It was MADE for busy people.

If you’re busy, then you’re about to fall in love with a diet (yes, you read that correctly). As long as you can set aside about ***20 minutes to make the smoothies*** in the morning, you’ll have all the time you need to make this diet work for you.

# You don’t have to give up food.

This isn’t JUST a smoothie diet. You drink 2 smoothies every day, but you still eat a whole healthy meal and snacks every day (samples are provided in the Smoothie Diet guide). If you need or want a break, you can add in a flex day every week and just eat regular foods (following the included Smoothie Diet guide). This flexibility makes it easy to manage, even if your schedule is unpredictable.

# It’s easier than pie (and also kind of tastes like pie?)

All the recipes are super easy to follow and made with ingredients you can find in any grocery store. (And yes, they’re decadent and delicious!)

# And most importantly, you can lose as much weight

1fyy93a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fyy93a/rapid_heart_rate_and_beating_harder_feeling/,Rapid heart rate and beating harder feeling,"Hello,

I have been having my doctor's look at me for months at this point and no one can point to the issue. I feel like just literally surviving is a damn hard job at the moment. I'm losing the ability to be able to handle it and tolerate it. I need assistance and I don't know where else to look. Please. 38 year old male. Generally good health, well, used to be.

My issue is that I generally drink a lot of water and always have, and eat very low amounts of sodium. I do generally eat less than the daily recommended dose but it's never been a problem. Normally I'm fine usually. As of the past few months, I am having this problem where if I'm not consuming, in my opinion a pretty large amount of sodium, and drinking low quantities of water, like, 1-2 glasses a day and my urine is pretty yellow, I feel like garbage when It gets more pale yellow and clear. I have been needing to drink 1-2 Gatorades per day or at least every other day, or consume a liquid IV to avoid this problem of feeling like I'm dying. That's when my heart begins to race, its hitting over 110 bpm and staying there for hours and hours, 10 hours straight has occurred before. Occasionally I can hit as high as 130bpm. It also feels as though its beating harder than normal while this occuring. Like, nearly struggling to beat. I lose all motivation and feeling of interest of doing anything while this is happening because it completely ruins the way I feel.

It has been over a year since my last blood test, my doctor said last year was good so he didn't think I needed one but him and my cardiologist seem to believe this is a heart issue not a whatever else issue while I'm believing I have some kind of terrible imbalance here that I can't seem to right. Neither sent me for a blood test with these issues.


List of things I was doing the because I think possibly they caused an issue/this issue:
I've been taking Omeprazole due to stomach problems and a lot of acid reflux/gerd, still taking this. If I don't, diarrhea.
I was taking a daily supplement of ""Stomach Soothe"" which I was hoping would be a natural Omeprazole replacement. Stopped that for now.
I also replaced my dialy coffee with Ryze, mushroom coffee, I have also completely stopped that.

It was my thought that possibly the Stomach Soothe and Ryze perhaps over loaded me on potassium but I'm not sure. I have no idea what to think. It's been 3 weeks now since I've stopped both of those and I'm still having these issues where I'm waking up 1-3 times a week, in a huge panic, feeling terrible, heart racing or times where I can't even sleep because it's beating so hard and fast that I dont sleep for a day or two.


I have taken a prostate medication before, and it has caused my blood pressure to drop, I believe is what happened at least, it caused my heart rate to increase similar to this and beat hard like this. I went to the hospital after taking it thinking I was going to die and it was recommended I stop taking it and I wasn't going to continue to take it again anyways after that experience.

By S. Payton

Hey there, fellow word-wranglers and story-spinners! Pull up a chair, grab your favorite beverage (I'm nursing my fifth coffee of the day because apparently, I hate sleep), and let's talk about the two things that keep writers awake at night: creating characters that don't suck and building worlds that don't feel like cardboard cutouts.

Part 1: Character Development (Or ""How to Create People Who Don't Exist But Feel More Real Than Your Aunt Karen"")

Listen, we've all been there. You're sitting at your desk, staring at your screen, and your character is about as deep as a puddle in the Sahara. They're either so perfect they make Mary Prue look like an amateur, or they're so boring that watching paint dry seems like an action movie in comparison. Fear not, my friends! Let's fix this mess together.

1. Give Them Flaws (Because Perfect People Are Perfectly Boring)

You know what's interesting about your best friend? It's probably not their achievements or their perfect smile. It's the fact that they can't parallel park to save their life, or how they always cry during dog food commercials. That's the good stuff!

Your characters need flaws like I need caffeine (desperately and in concerning quantities). But here's the catch – make them *interesting* flaws. Nobody wants to read about someone whose only flaw is that they're ""too loyal"" or ""work too hard."" Give me something juicy!

Examples of Actually Interesting Flaws:
- Can't resist making puns in inappropriate situations (like funerals)
- Alphabetizes their sock drawer but can't remember to pay rent
- Has lengthy philosophical debates with their houseplants
- Believes they can speak French but actually just adds ""le"" to English words

2. The Backstory Isn't a Back Door to Boring

Look, I know you spent six months crafting your character's detailed family tree going back seventeen generations. You probably know what their great-great-grandmother had for breakfast on Tuesday, March 15, 1842. That's great! Really! But please, for the love of all that is holy, don't dump it all on page one.

Your character's backstory should be like a good striptease (stay with me here) – reveal just enough to keep things interesting, but keep some mystery alive. Nobody needs to know immediately that your protagonist had a life-changing experience with a rogue squirrel at age seven... unless that squirrel is about to show up with a vendetta.

3. Give Them a Voice (And Not Just Any Voice)

Every character should sound different. If you can swap dialogue between characters without changing anything, you've got yourself a problem. It's like a ventriloquist act where all the puppets sound exactly like the ventriloquist – amusing for about five seconds, then just sad.

Quick Guide to Different Character Voices:
- The One Who Never Uses Contractions (probably a robot or your old English teacher)
- The One Who Like, Literally Can't Even (we all know one)
- The One Who Speaks Entirely in Movie Quotes (definitely annoying but endearing)
- The One Who Uses Big Words Incorrectly (indubitably discombobulating)

4. Goals and Motivation (Because ""Just Because"" Isn't Good Enough)

Your character needs to want something. Anything! Maybe they're on a quest to find the world's perfect sandwich. Perhaps they're trying to prove that their neighbor's cat is actually an alien spy. The point is, they need to have a drive that makes sense for who they are.

Bad motivation: ""I must save the world because I am the chosen one!""
Good motivation: ""I must save the world because if I don't, who will feed my seventeen cats?""
 Part 2: World-Building (Or ""How to Create a Universe Without Having a God Complex"")

Ah, world-building. The act of playing God without the responsibility of actual divine intervention. Let's dive into how to create a world that doesn't feel like it was cobbled together from leftover parts of other, better worlds.

1. The Physics of Your World (Because Gravity Isn't Just a Suggestion)

Look, I get it. You want flying horses in your world. Fine. But please, PLEASE explain why only horses can fly and not, say, cows. Is it something in their diet? A ancient curse? A really ambitious genetic modification program gone wrong? Give me something!

Rules for Making Up Rules:
- If it breaks physics, explain why
- If it's magic, give it limitations
- If it's technology, make it consistent
- If it's both, you're playing with fire (possibly literal fire)

Pro tip: Write down your rules. Not because anyone's going to quiz you, but because your future self will thank you when you're not trying to remember why you decided dragons can only breathe fire on Tuesdays.

2. Culture Isn't Just What's Growing in Your Fridge

Every world needs culture. And no, I don't mean just slapping some weird holidays on a calendar and calling it a day. I mean real, deep, ""why do people do the things they do"" culture.

Consider:
- # The Ultimate Guide to Not Screwing Up Your Characters and Worlds (Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Fiction)



3. Economy (Because Someone Has to Pay for All This)

Money makes the world go round, even fictional ones. If your world has a currency based on bottlecaps, fine, but think it through:
- Who controls the bottlecap supply?
- What stops people from just making fake bottlecaps?
- Why didn't they pick something more practical, like socks?
- Is there a black market for vintage bottlecaps?

4. Geography (Or ""Why You Can't Put a Desert Next to an Ice Field"")

Unless you're writing about a world where normal geography doesn't apply (in which case, explain why!), your world needs to make some kind of sense. You can't just throw biomes around like you're playing a badly designed video game.

Things to Consider:
- Water sources (people need to drink something)
- Climate patterns (weather isn't random, it's just complicated)
- Natural resources (unless your civilization runs on pure magic)
- Travel times (no, you can't cross a continent in two days on horseback)

 5. History (Because Things Didn't Just Appear Yesterday)

Your world needs a past. It needs those awkward teenage years, those questionable fashion choices, those ""what were we thinking"" moments. History shapes everything:
- Why do these two countries hate each other? (Probably not because someone ate someone else's lunch)
- Why is this city built here? (Strategic location? Good weather? Really stubborn founder?)
- Why do people believe what they believe? (Besides ""the author said so"")

 The Grand Finale: Putting It All Together

Here's the thing about character development and world-building – they're not separate things. Your characters are products of their world, and your world is shaped by the characters in it. It's like a cosmic dance, except instead of galaxies, you're spinning plots and instead of stars, you're juggling personality traits.

 Quick Tips for Making It All Work:
1. Your character's personality should reflect their environment
2. Your world should bear the marks of its inhabitants
3. Nothing exists in a vacuum (except space, and even that's debatable)
4. Everything should have a reason (even if that reason is ""because it's funny"")

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
1. Making your world too perfect (perfection is boring)
2. Making your characters too perfect (still boring)
3. Forgetting that actions have consequences
4. Thinking that ""because magic"" explains everything
5. Not having fun with it (this is supposed to be enjoyable, remember?)

In Conclusion (Because All Good Things Must End)

Creating believable characters and immersive worlds is like cooking a really complicated meal – you need the right ingredients, the right timing, and sometimes you have to be willing to order pizza when it all goes wrong. But here's the secret: there are no real rules. These are guidelines, suggestions, friendly nudges in what might be the right direction.

The most important thing is to create something that you love, that feels real to you, and that makes you want to keep writing. And if all else fails, remember: you can always add dragons. Dragons make everything better.

Part 1 of the analysis: https://www.reddit.com/r/Wednesday/s/VjmZBnsloC

How many parts total? Atleast 3 however part 3 is not written yet, part 2 got a bit unruly in length.


Wednesday starting to giving a fuck about those around her is another driving part of how we see Wednesday change over the course of the first season. Her relationships with Thing, Enid, and Tyler are where we see her main evolution. Eugene also to a certain extent, but him being attacked influences her the most.

When we first meet Wednesday, she is very distrusting, cold, and independent. She distrusts her parents, Weems, Dr Kinbott, and the sheriff. She plans to escape and never see her parents again. We got some development on this from parents’ weekend. It seems more that her distrust is more focused on her mother. When her father apologizes for ‘not being a good father she gives him many examples of how he did an adequate job and how he helped make her independent and true to herself. I am excited to get more information about her relationship with her mother in the next season. There seems to be some resentment there. She doesn’t want to live in her shadow. She doesn’t seem to value motherhood and has a hard time with positive emotions. She doesn’t understand love and aspires to do more with her life than be a house wife. We don’t get much regarding this, but I wouldn’t be surprised if she thinks her mother wasted her talents becoming a mother and housewife. 
Thing she forces to pledge his undying loyalty when she discovers him at Nevermore. She trusts him as an ally though is very hard on him in failure. I would be interested to know what her relationship with Thing was prior to this. She does truly care for him. She is very brazen with him. However, she cries and does not give up when he is stabbed. She also declares revenge must be sought. Thing also influences her relationship with her other main relationships.

I think one reason why the friendship anamoly between End and Wednesday works because of Thing. Enid wanted a bestie and someone to bond with so she wormed her way into Wednesday’s life. There may be some sort of preconceived notion about dorm roommates. Thornhill made a comment about making connections you normally wouldn’t is part of the dorm experience. And that they can turn into life long bonds. Thing serves as the person who can do the things with Enid that Wednesday cannot stand: shopping, manicures, etc. Enid also seems much less secure in who she is (atleast in the start of the series). Wednesday helps her gain confidence. Enid in turn shows Wednesday loyalty and acceptance. When Wednesday wanted to go to the Gates mansion when the school was on lockdown, she tricks Enid into helping her get out of the school. At this point, she is more obsessed with the Gates mansion mystery and being out maneuvered by the killer and care for the safety of her friends isn’t as present. But she is sad that she drives Enid away. They way that they act during their fight shows they care, but are being petty. A last note on Wednesday and Enid: Wednesday telling her about Nero and why she doesn’t cry seems out of place. But it does show that even in the beginning she has some trust or connection with Enid even then. Enid showed a vulnerability to Wednesday so Wednesday returned with one in kind. I think this is a great example of Wednesday having emotions and showing that she puts on a front to a certain extent. That she does have some deep cares and has feelings. She isn’t as 2D as she seems to want people to think and she is using defense mechanisms as guessed by Kinbott (But that also isn’t 100% of what is going on either). 

The other character that seems to get Wednesday to bring down some of her walls is Tyler. Whether you like the love interest storyline or not with him, she was still compelled to be around him and allowed more than a “business” relationship.
When she first meets Tyler, he is combative with her. He is stressed trying to figure out the espresso machine, she essentially questions his competence (assuming he doens’t know what a quad is) and he returns with more banter. He softens as she questions him and adds details about herself. I think Wednesday likes seeing people’s reactions to her odd hobbies and interests (the comment to Thornhill about secretly enjoying that other people think she is weird). He gives a ‘okay cool’ reaction and then moves on. She offers up her name when he asks: which could have been a product of banter and him being a smart ass so she does what he doesn’t expect and gives it. He offers to help which she accepts (she is getting a coffee and a ride out of her fixing the coffee machine. The look on her face seems to show some respect for him as he cannot be bought. In the first episode Tyler just seems to take in who she is and is curious about her. Through out many episodes we see comrodery between the two of them: wanting to leave Jericho, being in court ordered therapy, his dad being difficult, sharing why they are in court ordered therapy. He also seeks her out which is what is required to be in Wednesday’s life: people need to worm their way in. He seeks out Gomez’s police file and gives it to her and she responds that she is not used to people engaging with her. Kind of showing vulnerability and that there is more to her than the front that she puts up of not caring. There are many instances with Tyler where she normally would have not continued the conversation or shown vulnerability with others that she does. 
	• When Eugene suggested they go to the dance together, she was horrified and said no instantly
	• When Xavier figured out why she asked him to the dance, all he gets is a ‘it’s nothing personal’
	• When Wednesday and Xavier are talking about his proximity to the monster she tells him “for some reason I cannot fathom or indulge you seem to like me”
	• When Kinbott tries to talk to her about the Rave’N she asks if she is required to answer her questions outside of their sessions.
With Tyler, she banters with him (episode 3): eating Girl Scouts for breakfast (and throwing in for good measure the comment about an uncle to see his reaction. Episode 4, she warns him about his dad and offers up information about the dance that led to more conversation and confrontation. Her excuse to him on not knowing her feelings towards him was priority not, nah we are just friends. Which I feel like with other people she would have been blunt about. This is where her not liking positive emotions comes in to play and feeling that others will disappoint you and hating vulnerability comes into play. There was something going on there but she didn’t want to address it because she was uncomfortable with the new emotions she was feeling. I think she could have recognized what that feeling was (as she mention having a first crush in a writer/philosopher). But she doesn’t like those emotions (like the conversation with her father on how he is a good father) so she deflects and tries to move away from those. You could maybe argue that she wanted to keep Tyler as a resource however, she would likely just move on and try to find another way to obtain information. She is resourceful and does view people as expendable to a certain extent. She does says she prefers self reliance and being an island. Other examples of why I think she cares for Tyler:
	• When he shows up for the dance, she doesn’t tell him everything was Thing’s doing. She instantly forgot about Eugene and focused on him
	• She was looking at him almost the entire time of her dancing to Goo Goo Muc and allowed him in her orbit. Depending on what she was doing she allowed him to be closer to her and when he got confused where she went she tapped his shoulder to get his attention
	• She started ghosting him after Eugene got hurt: she didn’t want to hurt him
	• Tricking him in to taking her to the Gates mansion is where her obsession overrode her care in that moment. However, she did go back for him, she patched him up, and she tried to stay away and not get Tyler in trouble.
	• She seems thrown off when Xavier tells her about Tyler assaulting him. I think this is where her moral compass comes in. If she thought Tyler was motivated by hate for outcasts, they would have had a very different conversation. She also doesn’t refute him comment about “I knew there was a reason I liked you”
	• Wednesday doesn’t want to “owe’ anyone anything and generally doesn’t feel she owes anyone anything. She hated that Xavier saved her from the Gargoyle. She didn’t want him to save her so she didn’t owe him anything, With Tyler and the date, he was able to tell her she owed him and she took it (small protest but definitely not with the same out of vigor you would expect from her)
	• She warned him how she could hurt him if they became more than friends (which is ironic when he is found to be the hyde). But if she hadn’t wanted to kiss him, she would have stayed stiff.. But when he moved in to kiss her in the crypt, she moved in in return. She also described their date as ‘interrupted’  implying that she had wanted to kiss him as there was something missing
	• She enjoyed the date in the crypt. (Her facial expressions, “that was torture, thank you”
	• She was so betrayed when she found out he was the Hyde. The fact that she was tricked and ‘lost’ is part of it. But she put trust in him and was vulnerable with him that she is very guarded against. She is rash and lets her negative emotions take over (kidnapping and torture). Was that only part of it, likely yes. She didn’t trust Weems or the sheriff, thought Kinbott was Laurel. And when she tried to talk to Weems about Kinbott, Kinbott was in her office so that likely caused come hesitancy on whether she could trust Weems with her theory. She was motivated by revenge. Honestly, I think her reaction to him being the Hyde would have been very different had she found out prior to Eugene getting attacked.
	• She smiled when she kissed him and was active in the kiss (he pushed into her and she pushed back)


A note on friendships and love interests for Wednesday:

I am guessing that the writers did intend for Wednesday to fall for Tyler. That was how him being the Hyde was actually impactful to her. Otherwise, it would have just been the feeling of I’m wrong.

Growth from being an island is one of the major character developments we see from Wednesday so while some don’t like that she had love interests I thought it was fine. I don’t really see how it is different someone pursing a friendship with her vs a romantic relationship with her.  I think that from an outside view, close friendships and romantic relationships can look similar. It is all about how the people in those relationships define them and feel. Which we all know Wednesday is bad with non-negative emotions. As I said before: people have to worm their way into Wednesday’s life. She is going to resist, however Enid, Tyler and thing were insistent on being in her life. If they hadn’t, she would have stayed an island. I feel like Enid’s character needs more development time in season 2 which is likely because she is Wednesday’s bestie and her wolfing out and fighting the Hyde really solidified her and Wednesday’s bond.. While Tyler is seemingly the enemy at this point, I hope they spend more time on his connections into the overall world. Because he has so many tie ins (especially with the potential for world building), I hope he stays an important character, but since this is Wednesday, he will need to stay relevant to Wednesday (whether that is redemption to love interest, friend, or somehow frenemy)

When it comes to romantic and/or platonic feelings, logic really doesn’t work. Wednesday is very rooted in logic. So navigating any sort of relationship is uncharted territory for her. I think this is why her having a love interest is criticized because you aren’t going to see the normal teen reactions to things (think Enid vs the subtle changes you see in Wednesday’s face.) The subtlety of Wednesday leave open different interpretations and storylines for the writers to take so they can naturally grow the character as we move along in the story. 
 
I am not even going to try to make a guess on Wednesday’s sexuality. That is for the writers and the character to show us if they even want to put a definition to it. Based upon how they have developed her character so far, the road is open to what happens naturally in the story and can change based upon different experiences. I firmly believe Wednesday did fall for Tyler: but where she develops going forward is tbd.

I’m looking for advice on how to price a **Pirkenhammer coffee set** that I’m thinking of selling. This set was passed down in my family, and I’m not sure of the exact age, but I know **Pirkenhammer** has been known for its fine porcelain for a long time.

Here are some details about the set:

* It’s a **complete coffee set** for 6 people, including cups, saucers, coffee pot, sugar bowl, and creamer.
* The condition is excellent—no chips, cracks, or visible wear.
* The design is very classic and elegant, but I don’t know if it’s part of any **special collection** or **limited edition**.

Does anyone have experience with **Pirkenhammer porcelain** or know what a fair market price might be for something like this? I’ve tried doing some research, but I’m finding it hard to pin down a value. Also, if you know the best places to sell vintage sets like this (online or in-person), I’d love some suggestions.

Thanks in advance for any insights!

I found this URL with the same design that I have, that asks around 30 bucks for each cup + dish:

How many parts total? Atleast 3 however part 3 is not written yet.


Wednesday starting to giving a fuck about those around her is another driving part of how we see Wednesday change over the course of the first season. Her relationships with Thing, Enid, and Tyler are where we see her main evolution. Eugene also to a certain extent, but him being attacked influences her the most.

When we first meet Wednesday, she is very distrusting, cold, and independent. She distrusts her parents, Weems, Dr Kinbott, and the sheriff. She plans to escape and never see her parents again. We got some development on this from parents’ weekend. It seems more that her distrust is more focused on her mother. When her father apologizes for ‘not being a good father she gives him many examples of how he did an adequate job and how he helped make her independent and true to herself. I am excited to get more information about her relationship with her mother in the next season. There seems to be some resentment there. She doesn’t want to live in her shadow. She doesn’t seem to value motherhood and has a hard time with positive emotions. She doesn’t understand love and aspires to do more with her life than be a house wife. We don’t get much regarding this, but I wouldn’t be surprised if she thinks her mother wasted her talents becoming a mother and housewife. 
Thing she forces to pledge his undying loyalty when she discovers him at Nevermore. She trusts him as an ally though is very hard on him in failure. I would be interested to know what her relationship with Thing was prior to this. She does truly care for him. She is very brazen with him. However, she cries and does not give up when he is stabbed. She also declares revenge must be sought. Thing also influences her relationship with her other main relationships.

I think one reason why the friendship anamoly between End and Wednesday works because of Thing. Enid wanted a bestie and someone to bond with so she wormed her way into Wednesday’s life. There may be some sort of preconceived notion about dorm roommates. Thornhill made a comment about making connections you normally wouldn’t is part of the dorm experience. And that they can turn into life long bonds. Thing serves as the person who can do the things with Enid that Wednesday cannot stand: shopping, manicures, etc. Enid also seems much less secure in who she is (atleast in the start of the series). Wednesday helps her gain confidence. Enid in turn shows Wednesday loyalty and acceptance. When Wednesday wanted to go to the Gates mansion when the school was on lockdown, she tricks Enid into helping her get out of the school. At this point, she is more obsessed with the Gates mansion mystery and being out maneuvered by the killer and care for the safety of her friends isn’t as present. But she is sad that she drives Enid away. They way that they act during their fight shows they care, but are being petty. A last note on Wednesday and Enid: Wednesday telling her about Nero and why she doesn’t cry seems out of place. But it does show that even in the beginning she has some trust or connection with Enid even then. Enid showed a vulnerability to Wednesday so Wednesday returned with one in kind. I think this is a great example of Wednesday having emotions and showing that she puts on a front to a certain extent. That she does have some deep cares and has feelings. She isn’t as 2D as she seems to want people to think and she is using defense mechanisms as guessed by Kinbott (But that also isn’t 100% of what is going on either). 

The other character that seems to get Wednesday to bring down some of her walls is Tyler. Whether you like the love interest storyline or not with him, she was still compelled to be around him and allowed more than a “business” relationship.
When she first meets Tyler, he is combative with her. He is stressed trying to figure out the espresso machine, she essentially questions his competence (assuming he doens’t know what a quad is) and he returns with more banter. He softens as she questions him and adds details about herself. I think Wednesday likes seeing people’s reactions to her odd hobbies and interests (the comment to Thornhill about secretly enjoying that other people think she is weird). He gives a ‘okay cool’ reaction and then moves on. She offers up her name when he asks: which could have been a product of banter and him being a smart ass so she does what he doesn’t expect and gives it. He offers to help which she accepts (she is getting a coffee and a ride out of her fixing the coffee machine. The look on her face seems to show some respect for him as he cannot be bought. In the first episode Tyler just seems to take in who she is and is curious about her. Through out many episodes we see comrodery between the two of them: wanting to leave Jericho, being in court ordered therapy, his dad being difficult, sharing why they are in court ordered therapy. He also seeks her out which is what is required to be in Wednesday’s life: people need to worm their way in. He seeks out Gomez’s police file and gives it to her and she responds that she is not used to people engaging with her. Kind of showing vulnerability and that there is more to her than the front that she puts up of not caring. There are many instances with Tyler where she normally would have not continued the conversation or shown vulnerability with others that she does. 
	• When Eugene suggested they go to the dance together, she was horrified and said no instantly
	• When Xavier figured out why she asked him to the dance, all he gets is a ‘it’s nothing personal’
	• When Wednesday and Xavier are talking about his proximity to the monster she tells him “for some reason I cannot fathom or indulge you seem to like me”
	• When Kinbott tries to talk to her about the Rave’N she asks if she is required to answer her questions outside of their sessions.
With Tyler, she banters with him (episode 3): eating Girl Scouts for breakfast (and throwing in for good measure the comment about an uncle to see his reaction. Episode 4, she warns him about his dad and offers up information about the dance that led to more conversation and confrontation. Her excuse to him on not knowing her feelings towards him was priority not, nah we are just friends. Which I feel like with other people she would have been blunt about. This is where her not liking positive emotions comes in to play and feeling that others will disappoint you and hating vulnerability comes into play. There was something going on there but she didn’t want to address it because she was uncomfortable with the new emotions she was feeling. I think she could have recognized what that feeling was (as she mention having a first crush in a writer/philosopher). But she doesn’t like those emotions (like the conversation with her father on how he is a good father) so she deflects and tries to move away from those. You could maybe argue that she wanted to keep Tyler as a resource however, she would likely just move on and try to find another way to obtain information. She is resourceful and does view people as expendable to a certain extent. She does says she prefers self reliance and being an island. Other examples of why I think she cares for Tyler:
	• When he shows up for the dance, she doesn’t tell him everything was Thing’s doing. She instantly forgot about Eugene and focused on him
	• She was looking at him almost the entire time of her dancing to Goo Goo Muc and allowed him in her orbit. Depending on what she was doing she allowed him to be closer to her and when he got confused where she went she tapped his shoulder to get his attention
	• She started ghosting him after Eugene got hurt: she didn’t want to hurt him
	• Tricking him in to taking her to the Gates mansion is where her obsession overrode her care in that moment. However, she did go back for him, she patched him up, and she tried to stay away and not get Tyler in trouble.
	• She seems thrown off when Xavier tells her about Tyler assaulting him. I think this is where her moral compass comes in. If she thought Tyler was motivated by hate for outcasts, they would have had a very different conversation. She also doesn’t refute him comment about “I knew there was a reason I liked you”
	• Wednesday doesn’t want to “owe’ anyone anything and generally doesn’t feel she owes anyone anything. She hated that Xavier saved her from the Gargoyle. She didn’t want him to save her so she didn’t owe him anything, With Tyler and the date, he was able to tell her she owed him and she took it (small protest but definitely not with the same out of vigor you would expect from her)
	• She warned him how she could hurt him if they became more than friends (which is ironic when he is found to be the hyde). But if she hadn’t wanted to kiss him, she would have stayed stiff.. But when he moved in to kiss her in the crypt, she moved in in return. She also described their date as ‘interrupted’  implying that she had wanted to kiss him as there was something missing
	• She enjoyed the date in the crypt. (Her facial expressions, “that was torture, thank you”
	• She was so betrayed when she found out he was the Hyde. The fact that she was tricked and ‘lost’ is part of it. But she put trust in him and was vulnerable with him that she is very guarded against. She is rash and lets her negative emotions take over (kidnapping and torture). Was that only part of it, likely yes. She didn’t trust Weems or the sheriff, thought Kinbott was Laurel. And when she tried to talk to Weems about Kinbott, Kinbott was in her office so that likely caused come hesitancy on whether she could trust Weems with her theory. She was motivated by revenge. Honestly, I think her reaction to him being the Hyde would have been very different had she found out prior to Eugene getting attacked.
	• She smiled when she kissed him and was active in the kiss (he pushed into her and she pushed back)


A note on friendships and love interests for Wednesday:

I am guessing that the writers did intend for Wednesday to fall for Tyler. That was how him being the Hyde was actually impactful to her. Otherwise, it would have just been the feeling of I’m wrong.

Growth from being an island is one of the major character developments we see from Wednesday so while some don’t like that she had love interests I thought it was fine. I don’t really see how it is different someone pursing a friendship with her vs a romantic relationship with her.  I think that from an outside view, close friendships and romantic relationships can look similar. It is all about how the people in those relationships define them and feel. Which we all know Wednesday is bad with non-negative emotions. As I said before: people have to worm their way into Wednesday’s life. She is going to resist, however Enid, Tyler and thing were insistent on being in her life. If they hadn’t, she would have stayed an island. I feel like Enid’s character needs more development time in season 2 which is likely because she is Wednesday’s bestie and her wolfing out and fighting the Hyde really solidified her and Wednesday’s bond.. While Tyler is seemingly the enemy at this point, I hope they spend more time on his connections into the overall world. Because he has so many tie ins (especially with the potential for world building), I hope he stays an important character, but since this is Wednesday, he will need to stay relevant to Wednesday (whether that is redemption to love interest, friend, or somehow frenemy)

When it comes to romantic and/or platonic feelings, logic really doesn’t work. Wednesday is very rooted in logic. So navigating any sort of relationship is uncharted territory for her. I think this is why her having a love interest is criticized because you aren’t going to see the normal teen reactions to things (think Enid vs the subtle changes you see in Wednesday’s face.) The subtlety of Wednesday leave open different interpretations and storylines for the writers to take so they can naturally grow the character as we move along in the story. 
 
I am not even going to try to make a guess on Wednesday’s sexuality. That is for the writers and the character to show us if they even want to put a definition to it. Based upon how they have developed her character so far, the road is open to what happens naturally in the story and can change based upon different experiences. I firmly believe Wednesday did fall for Tyler: but where she develops going forward is tbd. 

And by no means does her caring for SOME people make her soft. She believed that being close with anyone is a weakness and has semi had that come true. So we will see where she is after some time away from Nevermore. My assessment of her alignment is that she is chaotic neutral. The chaotic part I feel is an easy assessment: she definitely does not follow the law and is not above murder (Attempted murder charges would just make her seem incompetent)

Long story short we’ve been friends for 2 years now, ever since we met in college. For the majority of the time I’ve always seen her as nothing more than that, a friend. However, more or less around the start of this year we’ve grown increasingly closer. She feels way more comfortable telling me very deep, personal stuff, and she has told me more than once that I’m one of the closest people she has in her life. Unfortunately this led me into a period of confusion wherein I was starting to lose track of the friendship-love interest separation, and now I think I’m fully aware I’ve developed feelings for her. The great majority of the time we spend together is one-on-one encounters, like going for a coffee, grabbing meals together, and a lot of times we end up talking until late in the night before finally going home. 

However, she has a boyfriend, and as a result I don’t think it’s fair of me to expect anything out of her, much less tell her about how I feel. Her relationship has been long distance for 2 years (and she’s only seen her boyfriend a couple of weeks during that period), and she doesn’t really discuss it that much with me. Regardless, I don’t wanna mess with her relationship in any way, so I’m sort of lost into what I should do. On the one hand, I feel like probably I should “back down” slowly from this situation, but on the other hand I don’t really want our friendship to suffer from this.

1fyxwd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1fyxwd8/how_to_prime_sale/,How to Prime Sale,"So this Prime sale as a few differences that are actually pretty cool. For weeks I'd been loading my cart with items I'm interested in and I write down all the prices (and use the Keepa extension to track their 6 month Amazon price history). 

So on the Prime Sale page the first item is past purchases and what items there are now on sale. I had a bunch of items from coffee to lightbulbs that I get periodically and it listed those, I scrolled to which had a good sale, and then looked at my past purchases. Average sale price was 20-30% less than what I paid the last time I purchased it.

Then I go to my cart which I had loaded with things and documented prices. About 1/3 had Prime sale deals, and sure, some had listed original price at $25 vs the $22 that I had written down (which sometimes is also a sale), but Prime sale price was $15. So, not $10 savings, but still $7 savings, I am not going to complain, literally every retailer does this (I worked in retail, so raising prices before a sale is normal). 

So after going through my list of saved items, items in cart, past purchases and browsing history, I still was able to hunt through new deals, lightning deals, specific item deals. Then last but not least, look for Prime Visa deals. Go to your credit cards and payments, select your Prime Visa card, and on that card's page they have a section where they list deals that pay 10% or more cash back (some over 20%) on purchases. Last sale they sent me a link to this, this sale you have to hunt it down. 

So, while I expect a bunch of newbies to come here and complain that this is a bogus sale, I have no problems finding a ton of stuff legitimately cheaper on the sale. I also tried a few items with the no hurry shipment and 7% cash back, just to see how fast they arrive. Like I sad, for items I purchased previously, my Prime sale price was 20-30% less than I previously paid, not price listing, actual payment. For items in the cart already I verified sale prices were 10-25% less than best price I marked down in the last 6 months. For everything else I used the Keepa app which tracks price history in Amazon and other retailers. 

So, unless you are willing to put in some effort, don't complain that the sale is bogus. Yes, there are some items that they say are cheaper but you can find an equivalent price, but there are a lot of things that are actually useful (like something I was planning on buying anyway) that are definitely a better buy today.

Don't read if it bothers you, of course.I have some doubts about my ex-boyfriend's manners. By demanding responsibilities from him, could I have triggered narcissistic behaviour? ","My F32 ex-boyfriend M39 (he is in a autistic spectrum, maybe this information is relevant, given that the topic is behavior.) seemed an introvert when I met him so I took the initiative of contacting also kissing on our first date, after a few weeks talking, which he later told me he took as a red flag; he told me that for him, things worked by going out for *""a coffee, then another coffee, and another coffee, and then...""*  He didn't finish the sentence, but it made me thoughtful because he had told me that in our previous conversation he had only been with only one person before me,  (in terms of kissing or having sex) according to him. But that day we repeated many times and after we left each other to go home, we kept talking and he told me it was nice and enjoyable;
On our second date, he said he already felt like he was in a relationship. Caveat: We were both equally open to it. The enthusiasm in the conversations was mutual, as it was for the schedules initially. But soon after, some arguments arose when I started to question him after observing some behaviours such as omissions, inconsistencies and a few lies. I think the justification for that may go beyond insecurity. Eg.: telling me he needed to go out to buy something when he was actually going out for a coffee with a friend.  At first, that was somewhat understandable, but as time goes on, it's natural we get more confident and leave the excuses. But it wasn't what happened in so many cases.
So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
And I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, so I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times. We just started having arguments. 
Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them as I read). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn’t want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously.

I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or talk personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me.
In order to break that loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn’t want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn’t serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 

Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn’t leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? 

HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other  people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn’t work out because he had a “sexual hobby” that didn’t work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don’t want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It’s a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that’s the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""♥️"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she’s my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn’t talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it’s fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' 🤔)""
But my point wasn’t about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people.

 I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn’t work out between us. The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.
 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn’t have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn’t necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (📌 On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn’t match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I’m talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but…) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn’t talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk. I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; 
Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that *because/however/although* I can't see a logical reason for that set of strange manners. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn’t get any response, even if neutral.
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really?

 Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way—nervous, sarcastic—and turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I’ll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn’t understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn’t allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 
He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn’t keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. 📌There we go: : we don’t live far from each other, there’s just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other’s homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.
There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of that guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, as he did but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat?
He justifies the feelings I had for him by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met. 
I've already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don’t know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it’s worthy of a magazine article, lol

⬇️Phrases he told me more than once that, in my opinion, convey superficiality/immaturity and don't align with his manners:
1. ""You are attractive, who would leave you?""
2. ""You are attractive, no one would cheat on you.""
3. ""I never cheated.""

1) heavy chest, need for larger force to breathe (not suffocating or out of breath but it feels like there's more resistance to the mechanism of breathing and i need to push it through), vocal chord tense (feels like i need to push out my voice, but only 75% of airflow or sound coming out)

2) slight numbness to the adjacent area of my lower lip accompanied by articulation problem (harder to articulate and enunciate), and also actual hampering of being ""eloquent"", also my facial expression gets more awkward from the mild numbness

3) not a doom feeling but high pressure and feeling of incompetence and anxiety

These symptoms suddenly started to come and go throughout the day since a few years back. And I accidentally found the effectiveness of antihistamines when i took them for allergic symptoms to pollen (typical runny nose and itchy eyes). Ever since then, i took a claritin a day for 6-7 years until i moved onto allegra last year.

Taking antihistamines everyday def helped but sometimes these symptoms would happen regardless (i double dose sometimes when this happens). Recently, one tablet 120mg allegra started to have less effect so im thinking of dosing up to 180mg. 

I quit caffeine few years back as i found drinking coffee appeared quite often to trigger these symptoms and only drink decaffeinated (starbucks decaf seems to still affect somehow).

I have not been diagnosed or consulted with a doctor about these until recently, when a doctor told me this might be allergic asthma. I am going to get tested for it and might get an inhaler. Would like to see if the inhaler will help with numbness and articulation problem as well. 

I have been diagnosed, however, to be allergic to NSAIDs (Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) such as asprin, ibuprofen, advil, etc. I feel like the symptoms I have is a mild version of the anaphylaxis i get from taking NSAIDs (I have been to the ER a couple of times until college after taking NSAID when i was ignorant of the allergy) I think this has got to do with what I am experiencing lately.

Anyone with relatable symptoms or experiences as mine?

Greetings,

I am from EU. I recently discovered this lifestyle at my company from my coworker. She has been my coworker for nearly 2 years and we have been great friends. From time to time, I was getting her coffee, cakes, croissants etc during lunch time and she used to thank me sweetly (maybe that made me bring her things daily, she has addictive voice). One day accidentally I met her in train while coming to the office, it was crowded, we were standing close to eachother with her ass rubbing me which made me hard. While we reached our station, while turning around she accidentally hit my hard dick which made me a shout. We pretended nothing happened and went to office as usual. During lunch, when I bought a croissant, she smiling said it's small and giggled. I thought croissant was small. Then I went on a work trip, while coming back I bought some local sweets for office people, I gave it to her as well. She thought I bought it just for her and said ""so sweet, you know exactly how to make me happy"". I was staring at her and unknowingly I was hard, she said ""I see a little one and I will see to after I get tomorrow's lunch, my puppy"". I was shocked. 

Later I googled for different things and learner this is a kink. I had no intention of pleasing her by being pay man but she assumed it. But now I feel happy and nice, I think I like this kink. I don't know what will happen tomorrow, I am thinking of taking a leave. I came here to explore this lifestyle further. I thank her for kind of introducing this to me. I am happy to meet you all.

I decided to put it through a serious test. 

45 days of consistent use alongside my regular fitness routine, to see if it lives up to the hype.

Here's everything you need to know about my experience, along with the benefits of recomp versus the non-stim version and their popular lean pre-workout fat burner hybrid.

Ingredients and what to expect

When I picked up **Transparent Labs Recomp**, it was because of the unique combination of ingredients advertised to assist with body composition, including **green tea leaf extract**, **forslean**, **capsimax**, and a small dose of **caffeine** from green coffee bean.

**Green tea leaf extract**: Known for its metabolism-boosting catechins, green tea helps increase calorie expenditure, aiding in fat loss when paired with a proper diet.

**Forslean (forskolin)**: Helps maintain lean muscle mass while promoting fat loss, making it a good fit for anyone aiming to stay strong while cutting.

**Capsimax**: Derived from red chili pepper, capsimax helps reduce appetite and boosts metabolic rate through thermogenesis, giving you the extra edge when trying to control food intake.

**Natural caffeine**: With only 125mg of caffeine per serving, recomp provides a gentle energy boost without the jitters, unlike high-caffeine fat burners.

# My 45-day recomp experience: results and feedback

**Weeks 1-2: Boost in Focus and Energy**

During the first couple of weeks, what stood out was how balanced my energy felt. The **natural caffeine** kick was enough to keep me motivated without feeling overstimulated. The combination of **green tea extract** and **caffeine** provided a noticeable bump in focus and energy, which was particularly helpful during workouts.

**Weeks 3-4: Appetite Control and Fat Loss**

Moving into the third and fourth weeks, I began noticing the effects of **capsimax** on appetite suppression. It made it easier to stay within my calorie goals, especially in the evenings when I usually have cravings. I was down about 3 pounds by the end of week four, which I attribute to staying in a consistent calorie deficit while using recomp.

**Weeks 5-6: Improved Recovery and Lean Muscle Maintenance**

By week five, I started feeling an improvement in recovery times. Typically, after an intense leg or HIIT session, I'm sore for a couple of days, but **forslean** seemed to help reduce that downtime. Despite losing fat, I felt my muscles remained full and well-defined, which is exactly what I was hoping for.

# recomp vs non-stim and lean pre-workout

If you're torn between **recomp** and the **non-stim version**, it really depends on your caffeine tolerance. The non-stim formula is ideal for those sensitive to stimulants or anyone who works out late in the day.

On the other hand, if you're looking for something that also doubles as a pre-workout, **transparent labs lean pre-workout fat burner** offers similar fat-burning ingredients along with more energy-boosting components to get you through a tough training session.

# FAQs about transparent labs recomp

**1. Can recomp help with fat loss without exercise?**

Recomp works best when combined with regular exercise and a calorie-controlled diet. While it may support fat loss through appetite control and increased metabolic rate, physical activity significantly enhances its effectiveness.

**2. Is recomp safe to take daily?**

Yes, recomp is safe for daily use, as long as you stay within the recommended dosage. The natural caffeine content is moderate, making it less likely to cause side effects like jitters or anxiety.

The main difference is that recomp contains **natural caffeine** for energy and focus, whereas the **non-stim version** is completely caffeine-free. Choose based on your preference for stimulants.

**4. Can I stack recomp with other transparent labs products?**

Absolutely. Many users find that stacking **recomp** with **lean pre-workout** or **transparent labs bulk** can enhance results, especially if you're aiming for better workout performance and energy.

**5. How long does it take to see results?**

Most users start noticing increased energy and reduced cravings within the first 1-2 weeks. Fat loss and changes in body composition typically take 4-6 weeks, depending on your diet and training consistency.

# final thoughts on recomp

**Transparent Labs Recomp** is a great option if you're looking for a product that supports **fat loss, energy, and muscle maintenance** without overloading on stimulants. It won’t magically melt fat away, but with a good diet and regular training, it can make the process a little easier and more efficient.

For anyone interested in a non-stimulant option or a supplement that also works as a pre-workout, Transparent Labs offers both the **non-stim version** and **lean pre-workout fat burner hybrid** to cater to different needs.

While I searched the Fellow site for solutions (alas, no mention of the problem) and watched the ""Troubleshooting"" video (which really just describes things where the solution is right on the display), it took a while to find the threads here.

And, unfortunately, the mentioned solutions didn't work. The Great God Coffee was displeased.

But I tried one last thing that actually worked.

I assumed that there was an air bubble in the line, so the pump was running in air and the flow meter wasn't detecting any flow...thus, no water. (There's got to be a flow meter, because it knows how much water has gone through.)

Since basic ""add lots of water, run brew, wait time"" things (including disconnecting power, waiting a while, trying a descaling run, shaking the brewer, shaking my fist at the brewer, shaking my fist at the heavens) didn't work, and I'd already verified the tank stopper and connection were good, I thought maybe I could ""force"" water into the intake repeatedly by ""bouncing"" the tank.

To do this, I simply raised the tank 1/2"" or so (maybe even less) and lowered it. Bubbles were visible in the tank. I repeated this about six times, tried an instant brew, still got an error. Did it about six more times et voila! We have water.

1fyxj60,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/1fyxj60/why_bitcoin_isnt_money/,Why Bitcoin isn't money.,"I've seen people like Jack Mallers and many others, including those in BSV, saying Bitcoin is the perfect money, it has all the characteristics that make it sound money, that's why it is money.

This is incorrect. The definition of money is something that is generally accepted as a form of payment and a medium of exchange.

Therefore “Money” is actually a descriptor of an end state. You cannot use the end state of “being money” as the reason it will “become money”. This is like saying the reason someone will “become” popular is because “they are” popular.

Its circular reasoning.

Another example that demonstrates how money is a descriptor of the end state is Gold.

Gold *was* money. But today it isn't money. How can that be? Gold hasn't changed. If it once was money, why isn't it still money? **Because money is a descriptor.** Gold used to be generally accepted as a form of payment. It isn't today.

Things cannot “be” money by default, they can only “become” money via popular demand.

For there to be demand there has to be a use and utility for that ""thing"" in the first place.

In other words Bitcoin isn't money (because it empirically is not a generally accepted form of payment), but it can become money if it has a use and utility first, which creates widespread demand for it.

Things becoming money have always followed the same process throughout history:

Use> Demand > Widespread Demand (Commodity)> Money

**So how can Bitcoin become money?**

Given usage is the first step, what is Bitcoins usage? Bitcoin is a public ledger, its a transaction processing machine that can process secure transactions extremely cheaply at near zero cost. So it not only needs to be processing lots of transactions, but also needs to be used by lots of different people as well.

So how can Bitcoin achieve this? **In the current financial system, via Fiat.**

If Bitcoin could replace VISA as the transaction processor (utilising its unique selling point for secure cheap transactions) by **processing Digital Fiat** like USDT tether, but for real life transactions, not just trading on an exchange:

a) BSV would see massive transaction volume every day.

b) It would mean everyone needs to use BSV everyday, and puts BSV into the hands of everyone who needs to spend $, Euros Yen pound. That's billions of people.

Every coffee purchased with digital $'s would need to use some BSV tokens to process it.

Bitcoin tokens would then become a commodity that everyone needs to use to make digital fiat payments in everyday life.

As a commodity it then has the potential to be accepted as a form of payment itself i.e become money.

**Bitcoin needs to simply piggyback off the current financial system** which is already setup for billions of people, in order to turn it into a commodity and thus money.

The beauty of this is that the Fiat financial system is already setup around the world. You don't need to build the system from scratch. All you need to do is tap into it to achieve widespread adoption. Its the fastest way for Bitcoin to become money. **The path is already laid out.**

To those that think no, were against Fiat, Bitcoin is the antithesis of Fiat we need a new system, not perpetuate the current broken Fiat system – you're not thinking about the real world and thinking pragmatically. This is ideological thinking clouding your judgement.

Governments will never give up Fiat. Fiat is a legal requirement to pay your taxes. 40% of GDP is government spending which they spend their own Fiat. Fiat is backed by laws, police, and an army, to retain control.

In the real world Bitcoin can become **competition to Fiat**, an alternative, but it can only do so if there is widespread use and demand for Bitcoin tokens.

Bitcoin has so many avenues for usage, that it sometimes gets diluted, it can seem so far away, like a scatter gun approach. But this one single sector - competing with VISA/Mastercard/Paypal/Venmo via digital fiat, would create a fast and direct route to worldwide Bitcoin adoption.

By carrying Fiat on its back via stable coins it creates a clear and obvious pathway in allowing Bitcoin to become money which ultimately is the end goal.

**TLDR**

Bitcoin is not money because money is a description of an end state – that something is generally accepted as a form of payment.

So to say Bitcoin will become money because it is perfect money is like saying someone will become popular because they are popular. This is circular reasoning.

To become money Bitcoin needs to be used, and Bitcoins unique selling point is as a secure cheap transaction processor. So to achieve adoption quickly, it needs to replace VISA and process the worlds payments via digital fiat or stable coins.

The fiat system is already setup for billions of people. Theres no need to rebuild it from scratch. All Bitcoin needs to do is tap into this, piggyback off the current financial system to create widespread demand for BSV tokens.

This is the most direct, fastest and simplest pathway for turning Bitcoin/BSV into a commodity and eventually becoming a form of money itself.",1,1728387090.0,bitcoincashSV,0,0.67,False

Lights didn't turn on and there is no response at all. I am sure that machine is receiving the power because I hear click sound after half a second I plug it in wall, it sounds like a relay click.

Might be a coffee morning, but I got a little more sleep than usual, so we'll see.  Still not drinking any caffeinated pop, though (54 days on that) which is something else I'm happy about!  

I'm not sure how long I'll be at church today, but I'll write you again after work or on the way up there!  Have a wonderful, amazing day, and do well, be well, and always shine your brightest...we both know you do.  There's nothing you can't do!  

I hope you slept well, and got enough sleep, my 😇

Since day 5 up to today, I do get at least 4 hours of sleep by the feeling of it, but I struggle to fall asleep (takes at least an hour) and then I wake up every hour, but the worst is I'm having crazy dreams, up to 10 different ones, each with such an elaborate plot I feel like I live in a different universe. After I wake up I remember them all. I'm so exhausted mentally after this during the day because it feels like my brain is now doing 10x the work when it should be shut off?

I've never had dreams of this quality or frequency when I was a smoker. I read up that insomnia can be a side effect of quitting, but I'm still really worried that there's something wrong with me and nicotine maybe helped suppress it. Those who experienced insomnia and vivid dreams after quitting, how long did it take to do away (if it did, at all)?

I was really excited to brew my first coffee. I did everything mentioned in user manual, plugged it in(We have same voltage range 220v, 60Hz), pressed the power button but nothing happened. Lights didn't turn on and there is no response at all. I am sure that machine is receiving the power because I hear click sound after half a second I plug it in wall, it sounds like a relay click. I could have claimed the warranty but I made a big mistake of cutting the power plug and connect different wires before testing it with universal adapter. I guess that voids possible warranty claim even if it's a manufacturing defect? I later reconnected the original plug and tested after universal adapter arrived but nothing happened. I am currently conisdering these options and would really really appreciate any help here.

1. Does the machine have earth sense in circuitry as a security feature that blocks turning it on? Because some old house here doesn't have proper earth and I suspect it's the case with my house.
2. Is it possible that it could be because of some common issues like blown up fuse or loose connector? I can open it up and have tools(screw drivers, multimeter, soldering station etc) and knowledge to do some basic inspection and repair.
3. Should I just send the machine back, repair and get it back? I think it's going to cost me more money and time in shipping and repair combined if it's not going to be a warranty claim.

I've lost about maybe 20 pounds already and while I did see some improvements, I knew I still had health concerns.

Ever since I was a child, I always struggled to go number 2, I swore they might have been instances when I wouldn't go a week or so, there might even have been one time where I didn't go for a month. I lose track but it's not impossible, if anything, it was more likely to happen.

At first, I thought weight loss and change in diet might help with it, but I could eat a whole cabbage, a salad or whatever and I still wouldn't be able to go number 2 without complications. Lately it's been very concerning as I've been having constipation for a few months, as in every single time, I was constipated. And when I wasn't a few months back, I'd always need to atleast drink coffee or drink so much water for it to go smoothly.

Now, I've even tried to use laxatives, I took one about 4 hours ago and no sign of me going at all, after eating, drinking two cups of coffee, I don't feel the need to go at all.

Aurelia took a deep breath as the Uber crawled to a stop. In front of her was a large brass gate, opened to reveal a cobblestone driveway that was at least a quarter of a mile long.

“Wow, it’s beautiful.” Noemi was sitting next to her, looking up from her phone for the first time since they left the airport. The photos and videos that Aurelia had seen of The Complex didn’t do it justice.

She could only see one building, but it was essentially a mansion, white and airy with big windows and chandeliers and a well kept garden outside.

Aurelia hopped out of the Uber and waited for the driver to open the trunk, which held five large suitcases.

Noemi followed behind her, taking her three bags, while Aurelia put on her backpack and took her own two.

The car drove off, and they could see a young looking woman driving up the path on a golf cart. She was neatly dressed in a pair of black leggings and a Complex jacket.

“Welcome!” The woman said. Up close she looked older than she had at first. She was probably in her 40s. “I’m Waverly, the director of the school. I oversee living arrangements, academics, and anything else you may need help with.”

“I’m Noemi White.” She smiled brightly. “And this is my sister, Aurelia.”

“So nice to meet you, Noemi!” Waverly exclaimed. “I’m so glad you could come.” She shook Noemi’s hand. As an afterthought, she shook Aurelia’s as well. “And you too, Aurelia. A pleasure. I’m sure you’ll do great things.” 

Aurelia was used to instances like this. Everyone seemed to be happier to meet Noemi than her. It used to bother her, but she was used to it by now. Aurelia has spent her entire life living in the shadow of her older sister, the former Broadway star.

Waverly motioned towards the golf cart. “Feel free to put everything in here,” she said. “I’ll give you a ride to the main building, and we can begin our tour before you start to get settled in.”

It took some maneuvering and adjusting, but within five minutes all three of them and all five of the suitcases were on the golf cart. They slowly made their way towards the main building, the one that resembled a castle.

“So this is the main building. You’ll hear most people refer to it as ‘main’ or ‘central,’” Waverly began. It was clear from her tone and confidence that this wasn’t the first time she’d given this tour. She put the golf cart in park outside of a side door, where a row of other, identical golf carts rested. “In here are the offices, the stage, and the dining room. Follow me.” Waverly led them to the front door. A small bell chimed when she opened it.

The inside of the building was just as beautiful as the outside. Everything was modern and gorgeous, from the white marble staircase to the picturesque chandelier.

“It’s quiet right now because everyone’s in class. Usually, students have the freedom to come here to get help, talk with the counselors, or practice. This is the lounge.”

She pulled open the first door on the right, revealing a spacious room with a variety of furniture, a stocked fridge, coffee counter, and bookshelf, a television, and a few desks. It was like a library, game room, and snack bar all in one.

On her second look around the room, Aurelia noticed that there was someone sitting on the beanbag chair in the corner. The girl looked to be about her age, and she was sipping something from a mug while flipping through a copy of Seventeen magazine.

“Gianova!” Waverly exclaimed. “Why aren’t you in class?”

i asked if she wants us to actually move on and promise not to bother each other again she said she’s not ready for such serious decision that i should go meet with other girls have coffee with them at the moment and we will talk later.

Roasted my own beans, had a non-profit roasting biz supporting mission work for several years, made mostly pourovers and espresso for my main coffee, and FP at work.  Frequented Italy and other parts of Europe for a while and got really spoiled on how easy it was to find good coffee.

  
A job change added more stress, drinking more crappy-ish coffee at work during long days, and I eventually relaxed my at-home standards and starting drinking more tea.   Sold the espresso machine, most of my coffee gear, etc.  If we aren't using stuff, we often get rid of it to try to maintain a less cluttered lifestyle.

  
But, I've been semi-retired for a few years, and my wife recently suggested I get a decent grinder again (currently using my Hario hand grinder) and start enjoying my coffee some more.  Which led me here a few weeks ago.

Ordered the Fellow Ode 2 and the Stagg kettle today on the Prime deal.  Yes, I know there are better.  Yes I know Fellow is trendy right now.  But the combo of performance and aesthetics seems like a good fit for me.  plus I replace my Hario kettle annually, so hopefully the Stagg lasts longer while looking better.

I'm revisiting some lighter roasts currently, which has convinced me I'll probably lean more toward med-light/medium on a regular basis.  I like more body and chocolate/caramel in my coffee.  My opinion may sway a bit with a better grinder, but for that reason the Ode Gen 2 seemed like a good choice from what I've read.

But I guess ""Thanks?""  for helping me spend on a new setup.  :). Also have a Timemore B75 on the way to add to the Hario V60 I've been using for years.  I'm sure I'll eventually get a Switch, an Origami, and probably another Aeropress too... :)

My partner and I are working on setting up our small apartment living room as a multi-purpose space. We want it to feel cozy and distraction-free most of the time, so we’ve decided against a permanent TV. Instead, we’re going with a UST (Ultra Short Throw) projector setup that we can bring out for movie nights.

We chose the Hisense PX3-Pro UST projector along with a motorized 120” CLR screen. The screen will be positioned above the windows and will scroll down in front of them when we’re ready to watch something. We’ll have the blinds drawn behind it to help control light, but I’m curious if anyone has experience with ambient light behind a motorized screen like this. Does light from behind the screen penetrate or interfere with the image quality?

**Room Layout:**

* **Red:** Electric motor-driven CLR 120” projector screen (above the windows)
* **Green:** Bookshelf/Media Storage
* **Purple:** L-shaped couch
* **Blue:** Coffee Table
* **Grey:** Fireplace
* **Pink:** Movable projector table (adjustable in height, stored next to the bookshelf)

Since the projector will be on an adjustable table that I’ll set up in front of the couch, I know alignment will be key (as well as cable management). My plan is to keep the table height consistent so that I only need to adjust the position laterally each time. Has anyone else tried this method with a UST projector? Any tips on making the setup process easier?

I’d appreciate any advice, tips, or experiences you can share regarding:

1. **Ambient Light Control:** Does light behind the screen affect the image, even with blinds? Any tricks for better light blocking?
2. **Projector Alignment:** How do you ensure consistent alignment with a movable projector setup? Is it realistic to expect good results by just setting the height once and tweaking the position left or right?
3. **General Setup Tips:** Any other insights on making this setup as efficient as possible while keeping it flexible?

Thanks in advance for any help!

Hey fellow wanderlusters of Reddit! It's u/solopassions, a.k.a. Derek, here to sprinkle a little wisdom and a lot of enthusiasm on the art of solo travel. 🎒✨

Ever found yourself daydreaming about embarking on a journey where you dance to your own rhythm and let the world unfold its mysteries one spontaneous adventure at a time? Well, I took the plunge, and boy, was it a ride! There’s nothing quite like rolling into a hostel, dropping your backpack in a shared dorm, and realizing you have no idea what the next 24 hours will bring — and that’s the beauty of it.

**Challenge #1: Conversation Starters and Icebreakers**
Picture this: you step into the hostel lounge, nervously sipping your coffee, when someone asks, “If you could be any animal, which would you be and why?” Boom! Now you’re knee-deep in a philosophical debate about the virtues of being a sloth vs. a peregrine falcon, instantly forging new friendships.

**Perspective Change Alert: Freedom Like Never Before** 
Solo travel taught me the art of saying “yes” to the unpredictable. Bungee jump off a random bridge with a bunch of Canadians I met an hour ago? Why not! Try fermented herring in Sweden—those hostel folks dared me, and my taste buds are still recovering, but the stories? Legendary. 

**Personal Growth: The Crash Course**
Navigating foreign streets with nothing but the local's hand-drawn map, I learned resilience. Trusting strangers became a skill, and every mishap turned into an epic tale of victory (or hilarity) over adversity. Talk about a confidence booster!

**Pro Tips for Aspiring Solo Travelers:**
1. **Pack light but wise.** Remember, you’re carrying it all, no buddy system to swap shirts with! 
2. **Embrace the hostel life.** Seriously, it's where the magic happens. (And do bring earplugs; Bob from New Zealand snores louder than a motorcycle gang.)
3. **Be open to connections.** A simple “hello” can lead to a breakfast companion, a city tour guide, or a partner for that ’80s-themed karaoke night.
4. **Document everything.** Not just “look at me, world!” shots but the small moments that make you feel alive—like that time you tried to pet a goat thinking it was a dog... 

So, to anyone browsing this post and feeling the slightest itch for adventure: GO FOR IT! Solo travel is truly a gift that keeps on giving — life lessons, new friends, and stories to make you the coolest person at the next family reunion.

Safe travels and unexpected joys, my fellow journeyers! 🚀🌍

I've been going in circles in my head about this one friendship, and I keep becoming triggered over and over again. It is really affecting me at this point:

I split up with a best friend end of last year and returned to a state in life where I all of a sudden felt quite lonely and in lack of a social network. I was pretty desperate to go seek out new friendships right off the bat but was also kind of stuck with a defensive and careful approach. I'd digress: Both me and my boyfriend end up reconnecting with a friend in January and we become ''semi - part'' of a group that consists of quite a large amount of people. We start hanging out with these new people and slowly become more intergrated in their group throughout time. I've now been hanging out with people from the group in gatherings for 10 months and me and my boyfriend really kicks it off with this other couple. I love having shared friendships with my boyfriend but also crave to form my own ''one - on - one'' friends.  
Here's the situation I find myself struggeling with: A girl who's part of the group began showing interest in getting to know me and continuously proposed to meet up and do something together whenever we happened to be at the same gathering. It took a while for me to warm up to the idea that maybe not every friendship I'd have would go up in flames at some point (I was pretty broken and fearful after my last friendship - breakup). She seemed nice and whenever we were together we had a fun time - Always kind of graviting towards each other and falling into conversation. She ends up texting me a couple of months down the road (Troughout may and april). First time she asked I had another thing planned with some people from the group and invited her to tag along. Second time we went to a café she works at and I helped her with some errands, got coffee and talked with her and one of her other friends who were there as well. Third time she asked me if I was coming to an opening for something local which I sadly couldn't attend. Troughout the months we also saw each other at different group hang - outs where people had invited us both. I also throughout the months invited her a couple of times to group - hangouts.

I go on vacation in June and come back ready to propose and ask if she'd like to join a little get together with some of our friends but she's all of a sudden very busy around this time and doesn't really show up for anything I invite her to throughout August. I end up becoming desperate and confused so I end up almost inviting her every weekend to a group hang - out. She never comes around but we still both attend some gatherings within the group though. Birthdays. Farewell party's and a couple of other things. She has stopped proposing and inviting me at this point though.

Last weekend my boyfriend invites her to come for a chill hang - out with our mutual friends. She ends up coming but we don't talk for the evening too much. She ended up meeting someone she knew at the bar. I make it a point though to ask her if we should figure out a date to do something fun/and or cozy together: I didn't have my phone on me so she texted me a reminder to figure out a date.  
I've texted her about it but her responses were very short and dry. We figured a date out though: next week. My problem is: I don't feel like she's been that engaged in my since June and I don't know what has gone wrong here. I don't feel like I've had a feeling about where we stand or where this should be going since I came home from vacation. She hasn't proposed or asked about hanging out since June. The effort doesn't feel reciprocated anymore.  
  
In my head I feel betrayed. I wasn't the one who started to initiate potentially going from an aquintance and mutual friend to actual friends. I felt like I took the bait and kind of just got left here on my own: wondering what happened. Why did it all of a sudden change? Did I not live up to her expectations and so fourth.  
It's quite important for me to feel good about her, since she's such an integral part of the group and I desire to stay a part of it but I've had numerous episodes over this.

As a mom, the holiday season can be the ultimate paradox: it's a time for celebration, family, and giving, yet it usually leaves us buried in credit card debt. Between buying presents, hosting holiday dinners, and keeping up with holiday travel, it’s easy to end up with holiday debt.

Did you know that people spent an average of $1,530 on holidays in 2023? Most of this was paid for with credit cards.

MoneyGeek conducted a survey and found that 40% of Americans were still paying off holiday debt well into February the next year. Sound familiar?

Paying off holiday debt is the first step to starting the new year financially stress-free.

# The Real Impact Of Holiday Debt On Moms

Before we dive into how to pay off holiday debt, let’s take a moment to acknowledge the reality: holiday debt can feel personal. Holiday shopping for mothers is usually motivated by our need to provide magical experiences for our children, but the aftershock that results from mounting bills—can be emotionally taxing.

Debt affects more than just our finances; it impacts our well-being, relationships, and even parenting. As moms, we juggle everything—careers, kids, and homes—and the added weight of debt only increases that load. That’s why it’s essential to tackle holiday debt in a way that fits into your already busy life.

So, how do we do that?

# Step-By-Step Guide To Paying Off Holiday Debt As A Mom

You have to get a good picture of how terrible your debt is before you begin considering how to handle and pay off it. 

This is where it all begins: get ready to review the figures and create a decent schedule.

# 1. Prioritize Your Payments (Because You’ve Got Limited Time)

Many moms lack a luxury like time. Financial management usually ranks lowest among the chores between juggling school drop-offs, job schedules, and soccer sessions. But don’t let the task of tackling your holiday debt sit too long—it’s important to make it a priority, even if it’s just for a few minutes a day.

The first step? Create a budget that shows how much you owe and where your money is going. Look at all your holiday-related debts, especially those with high-interest rates like credit cards. These should be your top priority for repayment.

**Pro Tip**: Every week, set aside a half-hour ""money date"" with yourself. This is your time set specifically to review your finances, change your budget, and pay any required bills. Though it's a reasonable length of time that won't conflict with family obligations, it can significantly help one keep on target.

# 2. Take Advantage Of Balance Transfers (Because Who Has Time For Interest?)

[Credit card interest can rapidly mount up](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/rising-credit-card-debt/) and make you feel as though you are caught in an endless cycle of payments. You can address this by transferring your high-interest credit card debt to a 0% balance card. This lets you pay off your debt free from the extra weight of interest, therefore saving time and simplifying management.

If you follow this path, be sure the transfer terms match. Usually lasting 12 to 18 months, some cards provide 0% interest for a limited period; so, you should make sure you pay off the balance before the interest starts to run back in.

**Brands To Consider**: Chase Freedom Unlimited, Citi Simplicity, or any card offering a 0% APR promotion.

# 3. Consider Debt Relief Services

For moms juggling work, kids, and debt, sometimes seeking professional assistance is helpful. Negotiating with creditors and debt relief companies can help lower interest rates, consolidate debt into one reasonable payment, or reduce the total amount owed.

# Accredited Debt Relief 

Accredited Debt Relief is renowned for its commitment to turning financial struggles into success stories. With more than $223 million in debt addressed and more than 82,000 consumers registered, their approach stresses the grouping of debt under a single, reasonable payment. They will help you reach debt relief in 24 to 48 months by giving you choices that fit your budget and needs. And the most pleasing feature? Starting the process won't damage your credit score. Their success-based rates guarantee that you pay only for results.

# National Debt Relief

National Debt Relief is a leader in customized debt relief, having assisted over 500,000 clients with over $1 billion in debt resolved. Whether you're a mom managing a household or juggling various responsibilities, their tailored financial relief solutions can help you meet your goals and budget effectively.

Their approach is simple but effective: they negotiate and combine your debt to cut the overall balance and payments. Having a program meant to reach debt-free status within 24 to 48 months and without upfront costs, they have helped around a million customers take charge of their money.

# 4. Avoid The Post-Holiday Spending Trap

You just made it through the holidays, and you were enticed by January clearance bargains– I know we all have been there. Before you know it, you’re adding more to your debt, even as you’re trying to pay it off.

One way to avoid post-holiday spending traps is to unsubscribe from retail emails and apps that encourage impulse purchases.  By paying off holiday debt faster, you can focus on your long-term savings goals. Remind yourself that spending nothing is the ideal ""sale.""

Reducing unnecessary purchases will help you not only save money but also prevent the guilt and worry resulting from extra holiday debt.

# 5. Set Up A Sinking Fund For Future Holiday Expenses

A sinking fund is a separate savings account where you save a small amount of money every week or month for a designated purpose, say holiday expenditures. This lets you budget for holidays next year without using credit cards.

**Pro Tip**: [Start a sinking fund ](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/sinking-funds-tracker/)in January with a target holiday budget for the following year. By the end of the year, even little weekly donations can mount up and help you to enjoy the holidays without running you into debt.

For example, If you save just $20 a week beginning in January, for instance, by December you would have saved $1,040—enough to cover much of your holiday spending without using credit cards.

# Creative Ways To Pay Off Holiday Debt As A Mom

Even with a busy schedule, these simple, mom-approved techniques for paying off holiday debt will help:

# 6. Monetize Your Hobbies

Many women have interests in knitting, crafts, writing or any other [hobby that makes money](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/hobbies-that-make-money/)- could be income sources. Think about freelancing and then selling your works on websites like Etsy.

# 7. Cut Out One Monthly Luxury (Yes, Just One)

We understand the need for sporadic indulgences, such as your daily cappuccino or your preferred TV subscription. Cutting out just one luxury can free up extra money to put toward paying off debt.

**Pro Tip**: Take a month-long vacation from a streaming service or challenge yourself to prepare your preferred coffee at home. Direct the rescued funds straight toward your debt repayments.

# 8. Create A Family Savings Challenge

[Looking For A Fun Way To Save? Start A Weekly Envelope Challenge.](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/weekly-money-saving-challenge/) This challenge will help the entire family save money. You might organize a ""no-spend weekend,"" for instance, when every family member contributes, or encourage your children to come up with original (and free) entertainment ideas.

# 9. Sell Unused Items In Your Home

Like other mothers, your house is overflowing with stuff your family no longer uses—from furniture to toys to clothes for growing children. Profiting from sales of these goods on websites like Poshmark, Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist.

You can also sell your unused gift card at CardCash, and Raise.

Spend one weekend decluttering and arranging your house. Making it a fun family activity will also help you to [earn extra money](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/how-to-make-extra-money-for-the-holidays/). Have the children assist with identifying items they no longer need for toys or clothing; and give them a small incentive for helping out. The money earned from selling these items can go directly toward your holiday debt repayment.

# Maximizing Savings While Paying Off Debt

Although juggling debt reduction with future savings can be difficult, it is not impossible. These clever ideas will help you increase your savings even while you work on your holiday debt:-

# 10. Set Up Automatic Savings Transfers

By setting up automatic payments, paying off holiday debt becomes more manageable.

Every pay you get should set up automatic transfers to different savings accounts this way; you’re paying yourself first without having to think about it.

# 11. Match Your Debt Payments with Savings Contributions

[Challenge yourself to also save $100](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/52-week-money-challenge-5000/), if you are paying $100 toward your holiday debt this month. This psychological strategy will drive you to pay off debt and increase your savings simultaneously.

# 12. Open A High-Yield Savings Account

Although regular savings accounts have little interest, a high-yield savings account will yield a more significant return on your money. Many online banks offer better interest rates than conventional banks, accelerating your savings growth. You can consider these [10 High Interest Savings Account Of 2024](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/high-interest-savings-account-rates/).

*Also, consider using your tax refund towards paying off holiday debt this year.*

# 13. Delegate Household Chores To Create More Time For Money Management

Moms are often seen as the household managers, but that doesn’t mean you have to do it all. If you're feeling overwhelmed, allocate some of the daily jobs—whether it's allocating youngsters their projects or if you have any adult kids take on more responsibilities—so you can carve out a little time each week to concentrate on paying down your holiday debt.

# 14. Leverage Side Hustles That Don’t Eat Up Your Time

As a busy mom, side hustles need to be realistic. Look for opportunities that fit into your already-packed schedule, such as working online during nap times or on weekends.

Consider micro-tasks like freelance writing, virtual assistant work, or selling homemade crafts online. These jobs can be done from home and are flexible enough to fit into your routine. Platforms like **Upwork**, **Fiverr**, or even **Etsy** can help you earn extra cash without sacrificing family time.

# Staying Motivated and Maintaining Financial Wellness

The road to paying off holiday debt can be long, but staying motivated is key to your success. Here are a few ideas to help you stay focused on your goals:-

# 15. Celebrate Small Wins

If paying off holiday debt feels overwhelming, start with small steps and celebrate progress.

Celebrate every time you meet a savings goal or pay off a credit card balance. These little benchmarks help you remember that you are progressing despite occasional slow travel. Give yourself a little non-financial incentive—a family movie night or a leisurely evening with a book. The idea is to acknowledge your diligence without increasing your financial load.

# 16. Visualize Your Debt-Free Future

It’s easy to get bogged down by day-to-day financial stress, but keeping your eye on the bigger picture can help. Whether it's preparing for a family vacation, creating an emergency fund, or just savoring the freedom of debt-free living, spend a few minutes every day seeing how your life will look once your debt is paid off.

To keep inspired, [have a vision board](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/vision-board-debt-free/). Seeing your progress in a concrete form might motivate you to press on, especially on trying days.

# How To Prevent Holiday Debt Next Year?

Now that you’ve got a solid plan to pay off this year’s holiday debt, let's discuss how to stay out of the same trap next year.

# 17. Set A Holiday Budget Before The Season Begins

During the holidays, it's tempting to go overboard; but, if you create a reasonable budget before the season begins, you can assist to prevent debt. Figure out how much you want to spend on gifts, decorations, food, and travel, and stick to that number.

Use a budgeting app like **You Need A Budget (YNAB)** or **Personal Capital (Empower)** to track your spending in real-time during the holidays. This will help you stay on budget and [avoid the shock of post-holiday credit card bills.](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/how-to-avoid-credit-card-debt/).

Breaking the habit of overspending is crucial after paying off holiday debt.

# 18. Shop Sales and Plan Early

Steer clear of last-minute purchasing; it usually results in overspending. Instead, start looking for holiday gifts [Black Friday](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/tips-for-black-friday-shopping/) or [Cyber Monday](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/best-cyber-monday-deals/) during off-season bargains. Making ahead plans will save you money and time and help you to reduce your reliance on credit cards when the holidays arrive.

Score savings on purchases with cash-back apps like Rakuten or DollarSprout. These applications can help you identify the best deals without spending hours looking for promo codes.

# Wrapping Up: What’s Your Plan?

You have already gone through more than most would. Your resilience shines through in every challenge you encounter. Tackling holiday debt is just one more hurdle, and your strength and determination have already proven that you can handle it.

So, what’s your next step? Breathe, pick a plan that works for your life, and believe yourself to be able to go beyond this. *Because you will*. You have overcome more difficult challenges; financial freedom is just within your reach.

1fywqa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1fywqa1/brass_boiler/,Brass boiler,"https://www.bluestarcoffee.eu/Mobile/en/ie/Gaggia-Boiler-brass/m-m-6176.aspx


Two points i would like to discuss:

1) I don't believe this is an official Gaggia Milano product.
I think its yet another WLL hack job distributed under the Gaggia NA misnomer.

2) what's the point?
An encapsulated heater with a brass housing?
The point of using the aluminium housing is that it's thermal velocity (Q/∆) is much quicker than anything else.
One begets the other.

Brass puts more hysteresis into the problem that was already there.

Every other manufacturer knows this and uses direct heating for brass boilers.

It's why thermoblocks are made with an aluminium superstructure.

I expect the shill industry surrounding the GC will love this. I expect that those deeply embedded into the machine will applaud the few positives whilst ignoring the negatives.

My thoughts are that it's going to be SLOW.
Slow to heat up. Slow to react to demand.

For a normal person, who wants a coffee without much ado, it may be terrible.

The volume is not much different (+30ml) so steaming will still be shite.

The temperature control is still archaic so that will still be shite.

The steam valve will still leak.

The shills who peddle 3rd party Gaggia tat will be thrilled.

For the normal user, its more expensive and less functional.


I'm happy to eat my words mind. I look forward to the genuine opinion and feedback when these things get in the mainstream.

","what should I do...I've been dealing with this nasty feeling for a month now. I met a man online in May and we started to communicate, and after a week of our communication it turned out that he was travelling to my city and offered me to see him and have a coffee. and I turned him down saying I had a lot of things to do, (I just don't like meeting strangers) 

But he kept writing to me and we kept in touch, but one day he stopped writing to me, I didn't pay attention to it because I didn't care about him, but after a week or two he showed up again, having said he was travelling to hospitals and he didn't have time. 

and after a while of talking to me again, he tells me he's going back to my town, and for a long time, This time I already agreed to meet him and we went out, everything was fine but it was the first time I went out with a guy and I was very uncomfortable as he was quite tactful and kept looking at me. 

and after this meeting I realised that I hadn't told him my real age... I'm 18 but he thought I was 20, I felt uncomfortable and immediately started texting him about it, and his reaction was expected, he was surprised and started telling me why I hadn't told him before as our difference wasn't ""normal"" and that he wouldn't have flirted with me if he realised how old I really was… but he admitted that he really liked me, but I didn't like him much, and I wasn't sure about him at all, and after that meeting he offered to meet again but I was working and I didn't have time, he offered to drive me home after work but I refused, like one day he came to my workplace just to see me,  he and I just sat and talked for a while as time was short and after that meeting I still wasn't sure about him, he seemed funny, funny and kind but still didn't know how I felt. 

Afterwards, he asked me out again, but I kept refusing, when suddenly he was seriously injured and was hospitalised for a month, during that month I thought about my actions and realised how stupid and immature I was, but I realised that I loved him, but he didn't show me anything special now… and it seems so absurd, i don't know what to do. i love him, but he doesn't even write to me... if i write to him he might reply briefly and that's it.

Hi folks,

Just wanted to let you all know about the Yonder Credit card. At the moment they are offering 10,000 free points when you sign up using a [refferal](https://join.yondercard.com/igj5o4k). Here’s a little bit about the card:

- app based. Get a virtual card which can be used on Apple Pay instantly on sign up

- get up to 5 points per £ spent using the card

- card can be used abroad for no fee (it’s Mastercard)

- get 10,000 points immediately after sign up through a referral and free travel insurance (time limited)

- points can be redeemed on experiences. These are typically coffee shops, theatre performances or restaurants 

- experiences are mostly london based and range from restaurants, coffee shops, shows, fitness classes etc. but now range various European cities including Warsaw, Amsterdam, Lisbon (even Seoul has been added 

- experiences change every month, and are viewable with the app

- to use points: simply pay using your yonder card, then within the app you can swipe right against the transaction to pay using points. Yonder will then credit your balance instantly.

I’ve recently used the card when on a few city breaks and it’s been great. No fees, app notifications (on par with Monzo) and you get the Mastercard exchange rate.

Signing up takes 5 mins. Quick KYC in the app, and you’ll have your virtual card ready to use straight after (app is swish)

TIP: sign up using my [refferal](https://join.yondercard.com/igj5o4k). You’ll get the 10,000 points plus 3 months free of thier Premuim plan (this is usually £15 per month). This gives you 5 points per £ spent and free family travel insurance. Make a note before the 3 months to downgrade to free plan (can do this in the app via live chat). The free plan is similar bar the travel insurnace. You’ll also only get 1 point per £1 spend - but it’s still worth it.

If you sign up using my link, I’ll also get 10,000
Points so win-win

I said “they will not find it” and bit my tongue for saying it.  

My colleague obviously perplexed said what makes you so sure.  Not to be to be that creep I made stuff up like “with all the gear onboard and tech, it shouldn’t be missing in first place” or sth like that.

BUT the truth was I could feel that it “vanished”, not tragically or violently but transcendingly.  Like fog in sun.  Of course it is a heart breaking event for families, the crew and passengers but I felt that passengers were transported “elsewhere” intact.

I had no idea on the day why I felt it.  ",5,1728383710.0,starseeds,6,1.0,False

**Explore History Through Your Glass: A Journey with 'A History of the World in 6 Glasses'**

In this episode of ""20 Minute Books,"" discover how six iconic beverages — beer, wine, spirits, tea, coffee, and soda — have shaped the course of human history. Tom Standage takes us on a fascinating journey, revealing the powerful impact these drinks have had on global politics, cultural norms, and societal evolution.

**Beer** wasn't just a refreshment but a catalyst for settled societies, as its accidental discovery led to the agricultural revolution. **Wine** became a symbol of sophistication and power, influencing social hierarchies and cultural exchanges from Ancient Greece to the Roman Empire.

**Distilled spirits** played their part in both medicinal lore and as currency in colonial trade, notably influencing America's path to independence with the rum-driven Molasses Act. **Coffee** ushered in an era of enlightenment, stimulating intellectual discourse in Europe's coffeehouses and even contributing to political revolutions.

**Tea**, initially a luxurious import, became a British staple, influencing both the Industrial Revolution and global geopolitics, as seen in the infamous Boston Tea Party. Lastly, **Coca-Cola** emerged as an emblem of American culture, spreading worldwide alongside U.S. foreign policy and becoming a symbol of globalization itself.

Pause and reflect on your beverage of choice. Each sip carries a rich history waiting to be uncovered. For more intriguing insights, tune in to the podcast episode or visit 20minutebooks.com for a full exploration.",1,1728383430.0,20minutebooks,0,1.0,False

I love him to bits and am very happy with him. Recently he has suggested that maybe in the new year we could look for a place together (to rent). I do want to move in together, but I have some hangups. I realise that I’m kind of a particular person who does things a certain way. But I can’t be the only one that feels this way. 

He’s been a single male who lives alone for over 10 years, and he has picked up some nasty habits. Every time I’m over at his house (which he shares with another male), his clothes are everywhere, there are plates and cutlery stacked in the corner of his room, and there is always takeaway containers and rubbish on the floor of said room. Unfortunately, the mess isn’t just contained to his room. His bathroom is a gross germ-infested area and I can’t even shower at his place because I feel unclean. The kitchen isn’t much better as well. The lounge (living room) always has empty cans of energy drinks or coke on the coffee table and used plates with old food scraps on them.

I do take into account that his flatmate is also quite messy and not the cleanest, so I can take that into consideration. I’ve asked him why he leaves his room and the general living areas in such a mess, and he has said that it doesn’t bother him. I have told him that it bothers me, and that this can’t continue on if we move in together.

He has said that he will try his best to start implementing the cleanliness to his life right now before we move in together, but so far nothing has really changed.

Are slobby partners a universal issue? Any advice is appreciated!!!

I started playing about 2 weeks ago, and I really like it :) So much that I bought Eunha and her weapon as a starter pack. I just finished world 9 and I have a few questions on how to progress in the game:

1. I almost have 300 mileage tickets - who should I buy the exclusive weapon for first - Miya or Oghma?
2. Which other characters are good to develop at the beginning?
3. What should I spend coffee on besides the story - blue books for Eunha, evolution stones for Miya, or something else?
4. Where can I get green hammers and legendary awakening stones? Is buying the green hammer for 5k gems a good idea, or is there another way? Stone are only few from synthesis once a week or is other way?
5. What's the deal with lock and change stones? Can I change item stats? If so, is there a mechanism to protect against bad luck? And how do I know which stat is better? Or only the numbers change?",13,1728382899.0,GuardianTales,7,1.0,False
