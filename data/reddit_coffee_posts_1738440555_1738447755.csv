We graduated 10 years ago but it's almost every other day she texts me just a ""wryd"". I work full time (in a career) and I'm married. She works part time fast food still (which entirely no judgement) we just are at different stages in our life right now and I feel like she can't understand that. I hate having to answer a wryd bc I feel like it's not really anyone's business (introverted me probably recharging). When I do make myself free because I don't want to lose our friendship she literally can't decide on any suggestions of what to do and just comes to my house before I even make a plan via text and then asks to get in my car and just drive around for hours and I have to keep pushing just to go back home. I love my friend but it has just become the most annoying thing to have to makeup for her boredom in such a juvenile way. I've tried to get her to make a plan, or plan on dinner, or a coffee...but nope it's a drop of a hat drive around and the sometimes she does want to eat is while I am driving her around and have already eaten dinner. I don't want to drop this friendship because our history is important to me but I never look forward to hanging out and feel guilty when I say no. I just felt like ranting and wondered if anyone else has a friend like this lol.",1,1738447653.0,introvert,0,1.0,False

We started dating at the beginning of 2019 and got married in the summer of 2024. Although we haven‚Äôt been together for a super long time, we‚Äôve been inseparable since we met when she moved to my hometown while we were sophomores in high school. She had been in a very abusive relationship before she moved to my town. Her boyfriend had been beating her and drugging her so he could grape her wherever he pleased. Her relationship with her parents has never been the best so she stayed silent about the abuse the whole time. The only reason her family moved was because she was expelled from her previous school for having ‚Äúsex‚Äù on school grounds when in reality she was so high off whatever he had given her that she didn‚Äôt even know what was going on. Fast forward to after graduation where we had been together living in a small Montana town. Although we were only 19 she had been begging for us to get married. We always knew we were each other‚Äôs soulmates but I wasn‚Äôt ready yet since neither of us really had careers lined up. But against my better judgement I bought an engagement ring and proposed to her the week of Christmas in our small studio apartment. We were both so happy and excited for our futures with each other but she didn‚Äôt like where we lived. I‚Äôm a much more outdoorsy person so I loved Montana but I understood where she was coming from so we agreed to move to the Boise area for more opportunities and so she would be happier. We were 1 year into our 18 month long engagement when we made the move to Boise and she instantly made friends at a coffee shop she started working at. She had never had a lot of friends so it was a big deal and she was super happy and I was happy for her as well. It was around this time she started making hints at the fact that she was really into women and had even told me that she would never date another man if we were to ever divorce. I didn‚Äôt really think of it as a big deal at the time since I had thought I had found the person I wanted to be with for the rest of my life with. After a couple months of her getting more comfortable with her sexuality around her friends and me she told me she thought we should open up our relationship just so she could make sure her feelings towards other women wasn‚Äôt just all in her head. I reluctantly agreed even though we were getting married within a couple months. It wasn‚Äôt until after our wedding that she had actually had her first relations with another woman and she loved it. She wouldn‚Äôt stop talking about how good it was and how she felt vindicated by it. It really hurt to hear but I had also been seeing another girl during all this because she wanted the relationship to be open for both of us, so I still didn‚Äôt really think much of it. Fast forward to about 2 weeks ago when my wife sat me down and told me that she didn‚Äôt think it was going to workout between us. She told me that her and I had different desires in life and that our relationship wouldn‚Äôt last even if we stayed together and tried to work it out. Of course I was devastated and start uncontrollably sobbing over the thought of losing my wife. Then she told me she hadn‚Äôt found me attractive in a really long time and that she was a lesbian. This also destroyed me and sent me spiraling to my lowest point. She moved all my stuff into the spare bedroom of our apartment where I will now be sleeping. We signed our lease to the end of November so we still have a long time until we go our separate ways. The worst part is that I don‚Äôt hate her in anyway. She didn‚Äôt have a very loving home growing up and was abused for years before we met. She was a broken person and never got to figure out who she was a younger age. I‚Äôve tried to be supportive of her through this but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way to salvage our marriage. Also my dad who I‚Äôve very close with help fund most our wedding. Neither of us has small families so it was very expensive and I know he spent around 15,000-20,000 to make it the perfect day for us. We‚Äôve only been married for 7 months and I don‚Äôt want to tell my family my marriage is already over. I really do love her with all my heart.

1ifhq8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/disneylandparis/comments/1ifhq8f/review_first_time_ever_visiting_and_planned/,[Review] First time EVER visiting and planned whilst travelling to the park this morning‚Ä¶,"I wanted to share my experience of visiting Disneyland Paris (first time ever visiting a Disney Park) given that it was a last minute decision for us this morning and we essentially mixed ChatGPT and our friends‚Äô recommendations to plan out our day.

A few things to note first:
- We bought tickets in the morning TODAY. It cost ‚Ç¨89 each essentially for the x2 Park Tickets.
- Given we have very little time (we needed to get back to Paris for a specific time to go to an appointment) we purchased the ‚ÄòDisney Premier Access Passes‚Äô which came to around ¬£100.05 each.
- We ate at the park; a coffee, soft drink, pasta and pizza cost around ‚Ç¨40 from memory.
- We travelled from Gare Du Nord, appreciate that we could had bought direct tickets for $2.50 each way but we had other places to visit so had the day pass for ‚Ç¨12 each. This train took around an hour with one change, but was super clear to get to the park.
- We arrived just after the park had opened which to memory was around 9:30am.


So here are our reviewers are first timers who knew NOTHING about any of the rides üòÖ

- Spider-Man W.E.B. Adventure ‚Äì 3/5 - Fun with a great storyline, but due to the lack of feedback was difficult to tell how ‚Äòwell‚Äô you were doing. We were told we had to wait as this ride was broken initially, after a while we returned and whilst we were on it it still broke multiple times. They seemed to be having significant issues with this today which was a shame.

- Avengers Assemble: Flight Force ‚Äì 4/5 - Great rollercoaster, just over quite quick. It was difficult to tell what the actual story was too.

- The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror - 5/5 - Brilliant, absolutely brilliant. The cast member who showed us to our seats was hilarious and I haven‚Äôt left a ride shaking in years. Incredible and had we had the time we would had braved another go!

- Crush‚Äôs Coaster - 4/5 - Very fun and very fast! This was the first ride that we went on and it was a fantastic start to the day. Very fun and full of character. 

- Pirates of the Caribbean Boat Ride ‚Äì 2/5 - Very slow but nice to sit and watch. Significantly better than Phantom Manor but also very difficult to see where you are going when queuing.

- Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril ‚Äì 3/5 - Over too quick and not enough loops/speed. The queue for this seemed particularly long and it really needed a x2 run-through to justify the wait times for those without the Premier Pass.

- Phantom Manor - 1/5 - Great cinematic but very boring. This consistently broke down similar to Spider Man but really wasn‚Äôt worth it.

- Star Tours - 2/5 - Needs to be in English but fun experience. I appreciate that we are in Paris but for the entire ride to be in French feels strange. Even English subtitles would had made this a lot more enjoyable.

- Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast ‚Äì 3/5 - Basically the spider man ride but seemed older from a visibility perspective. Fun because you can twist the seats to try and mess with the person you are sitting with.

- Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain ‚Äì 5/5 - Brilliant. Fast, exciting and un-expected!!


We didn‚Äôt know what to experience throughout any of the rides and attractions so it was a lot of fun as we tried each! We did unfortunately miss out on some of the shows like Peter Pan and Stitch Live that we wanted to try - maybe next time!

Some things that I was surprised at given the sheer amount of money that the park must be making:
- Lack of coffee, we had to really search for coffee areas outside of eateries for coffee and even then it was served in very small cups.
- Lack of signage. Although we used the app it was difficult to tell exactly where to go.
- Staff attitudes. Although we had some incredible interactions with cast members, the majority of staff were rude, combative and refused to speak in any language other than French even though it was clear that guests were speaking other languages. I appreciate that they can‚Äôt cater to everyone but having staff visibly laugh at attendees who were trying to understand safety processes or flat out ignore them was very surprising and disappointing.
- Lack of characters. We saw Woody, Jessie and Rafiki‚Ä¶ that was it. I‚Äôm not sure if character interactions are more so an American theme park thing but as someone who has always imagined what it would be like going to a Disney Park, I expected a lot more.


To end on the positives however:
- Yes we would love to come again. I can understand why people enjoy visiting, it really is a truly happy place where you can transport yourself into the world of Disney.
- I was surprised that the park food was a higher quality than I expected.
- The technology on display for rides like Star Tours is incredible, it makes you wonder what will come in the future to Disney Parks and beyond.
- I loved seeing all the merchandise and exploring the stores. Seeing so many people wearing headbands created so many smiles throughout the day.
- Love the bubbles throughout the park; they need to do a lot more!",1,1738447579.0,disneylandparis,0,1.0,False

Most of us are vaguely aware that we experience erections during sleep, but few appreciate just how vital these nighttime events are to overall erectile function. These spontaneous, unconscious erections‚Äîknown as ‚ÄòNocturnal Penile Tumescence‚Äô (NPT) in medical literature‚Äîare not just a quirky physiological phenomenon. They are, in fact, one of the most important factors in preserving erectile tissue integrity, supporting long-term function, and reducing the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED). Oh, and if you‚Äôre a young guy you might suffer from the same misconception I had: That nocturnal erections are caused by erotic dreams or being horny when you fall asleep. :) Nope. They happen because of parasympathetic nervous system activation or ‚Äútone‚Äù as we say, which happens to coincide with the more superficial phase of sleep that we are in when we dream, and they are therefore independent of the content of our dreams.¬†

The traditional view of nocturnal erections is that they are merely an ‚Äòepiphenomenon‚Äô‚Äîa byproduct of REM sleep with no real¬†*functional*¬†importance. However, emerging evidence suggests this is entirely incorrect.¬†**Nocturnal erections are not just a reflection of erectile health; they are central to keeping it intact.**¬†**Their frequency, duration, and rigidity directly impact penile oxygenation, smooth muscle preservation, and endothelial function.**¬†When nocturnal erections become infrequent or weak, the penis is deprived of critical oxygenation cycles, leading to pathological changes such as smooth muscle atrophy, fibrosis inside the corpora cavernosa, and veno-occlusive dysfunction.¬†**In short, losing nocturnal erections is not just a symptom of ED‚Äîit is one of its root causes.**

This raises an important question:¬†**If the loss of nocturnal erections contributes to ED, could restoring them reverse or prevent it?**¬†Research strongly suggests the answer is¬†**YES!**¬†Clinical and preclinical studies indicate that increasing nocturnal erections‚Äîparticularly through the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) like sildenafil‚Äîcan lead to long-term improvements in erectile function. Notably, nightly dosing of PDE5 inhibitors appears to produce effects that persist long after stopping treatment (months!), outperforming traditional ""on-demand"" use. Let me explain that last point: Taking Viagra now and then before sex does not confer¬†*nearly*¬†as many benefits to erectile function long term, as taking a PDE5i before bed every day. Another insight from the research I will present here‚Äîor perhaps I should say a natural¬†*inference*¬†from the research‚Äîis that the ‚Äúmilking‚Äù protocol that I have been such a vocal proponent of really is a fantastic method for maintaining or recovering penile health, since it circulates fresh blood through the penis in a manner that mimics nocturnal erections‚Äîor potentially one-ups them. Doing several short sessions of rapid interval pumping every day will be my protocol for the rest of my life, since it is probably just as beneficial for long term erectile health as cardio and good nutrition.¬†

**That‚Äôs the gist of this whole post**, so if you are in a hurry and don‚Äôt need to know the details, you can stop reading here. Taking Viagra or better yet Cialis before bed can help you recover from ED, or stave it off. Throw in some Citrulline, Arginine and NAC into that protocol while you are at it. But if you are not in a hurry and want to know the details, there‚Äôs plenty of detail to come.¬†

This article will explore¬†**why**¬†nocturnal erections are essential for penile health, the¬†**mechanisms**¬†by which their loss contributes to ED, and the¬†**compelling evidence**¬†that nightly PDE5i use can induce lasting physiological improvements‚Äîpotentially reversing ED rather than merely treating its symptoms. I will also give some detailed thoughts about the benefits of certain PE exercises mimicking the effects of nocturnal erections, and how the risks of certain other exercises can be offset by improving nocturnals. And for good measure, I threw in some lifestyle interventions for ""EQ Maxxing"" as the cool kids say.

Ok, brew a cup of tea or coffee, lean back in your armchair and focus, because this will get progressively more detailed from here... :)

# An important Question: Correlation or Causation?

A common argument against the idea that nocturnal erections play a causal role in erectile function is this: ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt poor nocturnal erections just a symptom of ED rather than a cause?‚Äù It‚Äôs a fair question‚Äîafter all, men with worsening erectile dysfunction (ED) often report fewer and weaker nocturnal erections. This has led many to assume that the loss of nocturnal erections is merely a consequence of declining erectile function, not an active contributor to it.¬†*But is this really the case*?

To answer this, we need to first understand the difference between correlation and causation‚Äîa distinction that is often overlooked in discussions about ED. Many of you know this already, of course, but I write not only for people with a BSc-degree but also for people with no prior knowledge, so here goes: Correlation means that two variables change together, but it does not tell us whether one directly influences the other. For example, ice cream sales and drowning incidents both increase in the summer, but one does not cause the other‚Äîthey are simply correlated because both are influenced by temperature. One of my favourite ‚Äòspurious correlation‚Äô examples to give is the positive correlation between how many storks live in a region, and the rate of childbirth in that region. Ten points to the reader who can figure out the underlying cause of the correlation without googling for the answer.¬†**Correlation**¬†can show up for any number of reasons.¬†

**Causation**, on the other hand, implies a direct mechanism where one factor actively drives changes in another. In the case of nocturnal erections and ED, the key question is this: Does erectile dysfunction cause a loss of nocturnal erections, or does the loss of nocturnal erections contribute to erectile dysfunction? The answer is‚Äîdrumroll please‚Ä¶¬†**Both!**

Yes, when a man develops ED, his nocturnal erections often suffer. But crucially, the reverse is also true: when nocturnal erections are impaired or absent for extended periods, the penis undergoes¬†**physiological changes that actively worsen erectile dysfunction**. This is not just theoretical; studies have shown that prolonged reductions in nocturnal erections lead to:

**Smooth muscle atrophy**¬†‚Äì The corpora cavernosa rely on regular blood flow to maintain smooth muscle integrity. Without frequent erections, smooth muscle is gradually replaced by fibrotic tissue, reducing the penis‚Äô ability to expand. Prolonged flaccidity leads to outright SMC apoptosis (cell death).¬†

**Endothelial dysfunction**¬†‚Äì Nocturnal erections are a major driver of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production, which is completely essential for proper vasodilation and erectile function. One mechanism involved is the internal stretching stimulus of erections, which can upregulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)‚Äîthe enzyme responsible for catalysing NO production from arginine. When nocturnal erections decline, endothelial health deteriorates. The endothelium becomes less responsive, leading to progressive vascular impairment.

**Veno-occlusive dysfunction (VOD)**¬†‚Äì The venous trapping mechanism that keeps blood in the penis during an erection becomes less effective in the absence of regular nocturnal erections, leading to weaker and shorter-lasting erections. This is a downstream effect of smooth muscle atrophy and endothelial impairment; when the corpora cavernosa fail to fully expand, the venous trapping mechanism cannot function properly.

In other words, nocturnal erections are not just an¬†***indicator***¬†of erectile health‚Äîthey are a¬†***necessary mechanism***¬†for preserving it. When they stop occurring regularly, ED doesn‚Äôt just remain static‚Äîit progressively worsens.

This distinction between correlation and causation is important because it shifts the way we should think about treating ED. If nocturnal erections only reflected erectile function, then trying to restore them would be pointless. But if nocturnal erections are a key driver of erectile health, then restoring them‚Äîespecially through interventions like nightly PDE5 inhibitor use‚Äîcould have profound, long-lasting benefits.

In the next sections, I will look a little deeper into why nocturnal erections are so important for maintaining erectile tissue health and how increasing their frequency can lead to real, physiological improvements in erectile function‚Äîones that persist long after treatment ends. I will basically explain once again how lack of nocturnal erections will cause endothelial dysfunction, smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis, and as a result veno-occlusive dysfunction, but this time in greater detail. Feel free to skip to part 2 if you feel you don‚Äôt want more detail.¬†

# PART 1: Why Nocturnal Erections Matter for Penile Health

The Role of Oxygenation in Erectile Function

One of the most overlooked aspects of erectile health is the role that oxygenation plays in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of penile tissues. The corpora cavernosa, which make up the bulk of the erectile tissue, consist of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells that require regular exposure to oxygen-rich blood to remain healthy. Nocturnal erections (NPT) serve an important homeostatic function by ensuring that these tissues are periodically flushed with oxygenated blood throughout the night.

During the flaccid state, the penis exists in a state of¬†**relative hypoxia**¬†(low oxygen tension) due to low arterial inflow and limited cavernosal expansion. In contrast, an erection‚Äîwhether induced by sexual arousal or occurring spontaneously during REM sleep‚Äîcreates an initially high-flow state, increasing intracavernosal oxygen tension from venous levels (\~25‚Äì30 mmHg) to arterial levels (\~90‚Äì100 mmHg). Oxygen tension refers to the partial pressure of oxygen (pO‚ÇÇ) in a specific environment, such as within tissues or blood vessels, essentially measuring how much oxygen is available for biological processes. Although the high-flow state tapers off as the veno-occlusive mechanism engages, the high cavernosal pressure is retained, which maintains a high partial pressure of oxygen for quite some time. This is possible because the penile tissues do not demand as much oxygen as other tissues and organs; hence, the oxygen-rich blood, once trapped, continues to sustain elevated oxygen tension even when arterial inflow diminishes.

**This oxygen influx is essential for several reasons:**

**Endothelial Health and the Role of eNOS**

The endothelium plays a key role in erectile function by releasing nitric oxide (NO). NO is synthesised by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) from arginine, and it sustains an erection by activating guanylate cyclase. This enzyme catalyses the conversion of GTP to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which in turn promotes smooth muscle relaxation and further arterial dilation‚Äîboth vital for the maintenance of the erectile state. (I am glossing over the detail that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from intracavernosal nerve endings initially triggers the process, with the endothelium then taking over by utilising eNOS to sustain elevated NO levels.)

**Top level understanding:**¬†

Regular nocturnal erections help¬†**upregulate eNOS activity**, maintaining the endothelium‚Äôs ability to generate sufficient NO when needed for arousal-induced erections.¬†**Reduced NO bioavailability**¬†is a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction, which is one of the earliest and most significant contributors to age-related erectile dysfunction and vasculogenic ED.

**A slightly deeper dive on eNOS up-regulation:**¬†When an erection occurs, the surge in arterial inflow produces¬†**mechanical shear stress**¬†on the endothelial cells lining the cavernosal sinusoids. This mechanical stimulus triggers intracellular signalling cascades, including the activation of kinases such as Akt, which phosphorylates eNOS at specific serine residues, thereby enhancing its catalytic activity. They keep eNOS happy and healthy and in its most active form. An addition to this, shear stress can induce the transcription of the eNOS gene, leading to increased enzyme expression. Expression here means ‚Äúmaking more of‚Äù. Over time, these repeated episodes of shear stress help to maintain or even boost the endothelial cells‚Äô capacity to produce NO, which ensures that sufficient vasodilatory signalling is available when arousal-induced erections are required. Nocturnal erections are what enable you to have daytime erections, to put it in oversimplified terms.¬†

Reduced NO bioavailability is multifactorial in its aetiology (causes). One major contributor is the increased production of¬†**reactive oxygen species (ROS)**, which can stem from poorly functioning mitochondria, among other sources. Under normal conditions, mitochondria generate ROS at low levels (in the process of oxidizing fuel to convert AMP and ADP to the energy currency ATP); however, in ageing or in disease states, mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to excessive ROS generation (such as in covid infections, actually ‚Äî the reason for ‚Äúcovid dick‚Äù). These ROS, particularly superoxide anions, can rapidly react with NO to form¬†**peroxynitrite**, which is a potent oxidant that not only¬†**reduces NO levels**¬†but can also¬†**damage the endothelium**¬†and¬†**further impair eNOS function**. (If you are paying attention and reading with your brain engaged, you will realize that this is the start of a vicious cycle). This process is sometimes exacerbated by a decrease in the availability of essential cofactors such as tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is necessary for proper eNOS activity. When BH4 is depleted or oxidised, eNOS can become ‚Äúuncoupled‚Äù and produce superoxide instead of NO, further contributing to oxidative stress and a vicious cycle of endothelial dysfunction.¬†[u/Semtex7](https://sh.reddit.com/user/Semtex7/)¬†and I have both written about supplements which can aid the master antioxidant glutathione in scavenging ROS so as to prevent NO from being turned into peroxynitrite and prevent BH4 from being oxidised. I‚Äôm too lazy to link them here - go find the articles in the wiki. :)¬†

**In brief summary**¬†before we go on; while regular nocturnal erections provide beneficial mechanical stimuli that upregulate eNOS and preserve NO production, conditions that promote mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive ROS formation undermine NO bioavailability. This imbalance is a key factor in the development of age-related erectile dysfunction and vasculogenic ED.¬†

There are many risk factors we can control: Smoking, alcohol, high intake of fructose or disaccharides containing fructose or high-fructose corn syrup and similar, poor cardiovascular health, the systemic inflammation and poor mitochondrial function that are the hallmarks of metabolic syndrome (the root cause of poor appetite control, obesity, diabetes type 2, etc) - many lifestyle factors are at play here. Supplements that support the function of glutathione, act as antioxidants, and suppress systemic inflammations are the best friends of erectile function.¬†

That‚Äôs it for eNOS and endothelial cells - let‚Äôs move on to the next key cell type: the smooth muscle cells (SMCs).

**Smooth Muscle Integrity and the Prevention of Fibrosis**

Cavernosal smooth muscle is indispensable for erectile function. In the absence of adequate mechanical stimulation, the smooth muscle can undergo detrimental remodelling. Prolonged periods without proper activation‚Äîsuch as when nocturnal erections are impaired‚Äîcan lead to muscle atrophy, whereby these specialised cells lose their contractile capability, and they are progressively replaced by fibrotic, collagen-dense tissue.

Fibrosis is not merely a passive replacement of functional tissue; it actively undermines the mechanical properties of the corpora cavernosa. As collagen accumulates inside the CC, the tissue loses its compliance and elasticity, which are necessary for the expansion to happen during an erection. The loss of these properties makes it more difficult for the penis to fully engorge with blood, resulting in weaker erections that are both shorter in duration and less rigid. If the CC can‚Äôt inflate fully due to being fibrotic, they simply can‚Äôt properly compress the venules against the tunica, and you get¬†**venous leak**¬†or¬†**Veno-occlusive dysfunction (VOD)**.¬†

With VOD, blood escapes too rapidly from the erectile tissue, leading to an inability to sustain an erection. This leakage is a common finding in conditions like ‚Äúsoft glans syndrome‚Äù and is often observed in age-related erectile dysfunction, as well as in cases associated with diabetes.

A key mediator of this fibrotic transformation inside the CC is the upregulation of¬†**transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-Œ≤1)**. Under conditions of chronic hypoxia or disuse, as might occur with long-term impairment of nocturnal erections, TGF-Œ≤1 expression increases. This cytokine drives the conversion of resident fibroblasts into myofibroblasts‚Äîcells that synthesise large amounts of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. The resultant deposition of collagen alters the structural matrix of the erectile tissue, further inhibiting the necessary distensibility of the corpora cavernosa. In PE we are used to thinking of collagen synthesis as a ‚Äúgood thing‚Äù. And it is - in the tunica! But not inside the CC.¬†¬†

Evidence from both animal models and clinical observations exists for the phenomenon I‚Äôm describing. In rodent studies, sustained hypoxia led directly to heightened TGF-Œ≤1 levels, followed by notable smooth muscle loss and collagen deposition. (Lv, B. et al. (2014). Phenotypic transition of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells subjected to hypoxia. Cell and Tissue Research, 357, 823 - 833 and in L√º BD et al, \[Hypoxia promotes corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cell apoptosis in SD rats\] (in Chinese). Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue. 2009 Nov;15(11):990-3)

Similar remodelling has been documented in men with long-term spinal cord injuries, who experience diminished reflexogenic and nocturnal erections, and in patients following radical prostatectomy. In these cases, the absence of regular mechanical stimulation accelerates fibrotic remodelling. Two cases perhaps worthy of special mention since they are so common, are (1) men with untreated sleep apnea, who experience disrupted sleep cycles and reduced nocturnal erection and who have a significantly higher incidence of cavernosal fibrosis and ED‚Äã, and (2) diabetic men, where the combination of vascular dysfunction and reduced nocturnal erections accelerates the onset of collagen remodeling and VOD, making them less responsive to PDE5 inhibitors over time.¬†

**In brief summary**¬†again before we go on, the preservation of cavernosal smooth muscle is critical to maintaining effective erectile function. Regular physiological activation through nocturnal erections not only prevents atrophy but also guards against the fibrotic processes that render the erectile tissue less capable of achieving full rigidity. Regular penile activity: good. No-Fap: sheer idiocy.¬†**Use it or lose it.**¬†

If you take nothing else away from this section, let it be this:¬†**The penis needs nocturnal erections to prevent long-term deterioration**. The absence of these erections is not just a temporary dysfunction‚Äîit is a progressive pathology that leads to fibrosis, venous leakage, and irreversible structural changes in the erectile tissue. (Well, perhaps not so irreversible - CF602 and a protocol of milking for oxygenation and stretching stimulus could help, as could shockwave treatment and PRP injections. But unless aggressively treated, it‚Äôs a progressive and irreversible pathology that does not get better on its own).¬†

With this in mind, it becomes clear why interventions aimed at restoring nocturnal erections‚Äîsuch as nightly PDE5i use‚Äîare not just a temporary fix, but massively important for reversing or preventing the progression of ED.

In the next section, we will explore how nightly PDE5 inhibitor use can actively preserve and even restore erectile function, reversing the damage caused by the absence of nocturnal erections.

# 

# PART 2: The Science of Nightly PDE5 Inhibitor Use

**The Evidence for Nightly PDE5i Over On-Demand Use**

The standard approach to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED) has long been ‚Äúon-demand use‚Äù ‚Äî taking the drug shortly before sexual activity to more easily get erect. However, a growing body of research suggests that this strategy may be suboptimal for long-term erectile health, especially when compared to nightly dosing protocols. This is the main reason I am writing this post.¬†

Several key studies have demonstrated that regular, nightly use of PDE5 inhibitors leads to sustained improvements in erectile function,¬†**even after the medication is discontinued**. This suggests that these drugs are doing more than just acutely improving erections‚Äîthey are actively preserving and even restoring erectile tissue health.

**Key Studies Supporting Nightly PDE5i Use**

**1. Long-Term Improvement in Erectile Function Scores**

In a randomised controlled trial by Mathers et al., men with mild-to-moderate ED were assigned either fixed low-dose nightly sildenafil (25 mg) or vardenafil (5 mg), or a variable-dose regimen¬†**based on nocturnal penile tumescence (NPTR) measurements**‚Äã. (They were tracking their erections during the night to dial in the dose)

After one year of nightly PDE5i therapy, 64% of men in the fixed-dose group and 75% in the NPTR-guided group¬†**had erectile function (EF) scores in the normal range‚Äã**. Wow!

More impressively, even after stopping the medication for a four-week washout period, 35% of men in the fixed-dose group and 62% in the NPTR-guided group maintained normal erectile function‚Äã.¬†**They had been cured**.¬†

(Mathers, M. J., Klotz, T., Brandt, A. S., Roth, S., & Sommer, F. (2008). Long‚Äêterm treatment of erectile dysfunction with a phosphodiesterase‚Äê5 inhibitor and dose optimization based on nocturnal penile tumescence. BJU International, 101(9), 1129‚Äì1134)

**2. Persistent Benefits After a Washout Period**

Another study by Sommer et al. examined 50 mg nightly sildenafil versus on-demand use over one year, followed by a one-month and six-month washout phase‚Äã.

After the first washout phase, 60% of men in the nightly sildenafil group retained¬†**normal erectile function**, compared to just 8% in the on-demand group‚Äã.

Of those who maintained normal erectile function, 95% were still functional six months later, despite no further medication‚Äã.¬†**They had been cured**.¬†

(Sommer, F., Klotz, T., & Engelmann, U. (2007). Improved spontaneous erectile function in men with mild‚Äêto‚Äêmoderate arteriogenic erectile dysfunction treated with a nightly dose of sildenafil for one year: A randomised trial. Asian Journal of Andrology, 9(1), 134‚Äì141)

**4. Enhanced Endothelial Function and Erectile Response in Animal Models**

In a preclinical study by Behr-Roussel et al., rats were given daily sildenafil for eight weeks, and their erectile responses were evaluated‚Äã.

Endothelium-dependent relaxations of cavernosal smooth muscle were significantly enhanced, indicating improved endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) function‚Äã.

Additionally, rats that had been on chronic sildenafil therapy responded more strongly to acute sildenafil administration, suggesting a lasting improvement in cavernosal responsiveness‚Äã.

Importantly, there was no evidence of tachyphylaxis (tolerance)‚Äîa concern sometimes raised with long-term PDE5i use‚Äã.(Behr‚ÄêRoussel, D., Gorny, D., Mevel, K., Caisey, S., Bernab√©, J., Burgess, G., Wayman, C., Alexandre, L., & Giuliano, F. (2005). Chronic sildenafil improves erectile function and endothelium‚Äêdependent cavernosal relaxations in rats: Lack of tachyphylaxis. European Urology, 47(1), 87‚Äì91)

**Why Does Daily (well, nightly) Dosing Work?**

Unlike on-demand use, which simply provides a short-term boost in erectile response, daily PDE5i therapy (taken before sleep) appears to induce lasting structural and biochemical changes in the erectile tissue. The mechanisms behind this include:

**Prolonged cGMP Availability ‚Üí Sustained Vasodilation**

PDE5 inhibitors block the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), allowing prolonged smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.

Over time, this repeated exposure to high cGMP levels leads to structural adaptations in the endothelium and smooth muscle, increasing the penis‚Äôs baseline ability to achieve and sustain erections‚Äã. It‚Äôs probably not the cGMP levels themselves, but rather the higher oxygen pressure and the stretching stimulus that does the actual heavy lifting, as we can infer from part 1.¬†

**More Nocturnal Erections ‚Üí Less Fibrosis, More Smooth Muscle Retention**

As established in Part 1, nocturnal erections are a cornerstone for maintaining penile oxygenation and preventing fibrosis.

**Regular nightly PDE5i use increases the frequency and quality of nocturnal erections, thereby protecting against cavernosal smooth muscle atrophy and collagen deposition‚Äã.**

**Endothelial Repair and Angiogenesis**

PDE5 inhibitors enhance nitric oxide (NO) signaling, which in turn stimulates endothelial repair and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis)‚Äã.¬†

This effect is particularly important for men with endothelial dysfunction (e.g., due to diabetes, hypertension, or ageing), as it can reverse some of the microvascular damage contributing to ED‚Äã.

Taken together, these findings suggest that nightly PDE5 inhibitor use is not just a symptomatic treatment‚Äîit has the potential to¬†**fundamentally restore erectile function**¬†by reversing the underlying pathological processes of vasculogenic ED.

**Optimising Treatment: The Role of Dose Titration and Individual Response**

While the evidence for nightly PDE5i use is compelling, not all men respond equally to the same dosage. In some cases, suboptimal dosing can lead to limited efficacy, while higher doses may cause unnecessary side effects. This is where dose titration and individualised treatment strategies come into play.

**The Importance of Dose Adjustments Based on NPTR Measurements**

The study by Mathers et al. demonstrated that optimising PDE5i dose based on nocturnal penile tumescence (NPTR) results led to superior outcomes compared to a fixed-dose regimen‚Äã. Slightly superior, that is. Let‚Äôs not make too much of it.¬†

In this study, men were given the lowest effective dose that induced full nocturnal erections, determined via NPTR monitoring.¬†

Those in the dose-adjusted group had higher erectile function scores than those who received a fixed low dose (25 mg sildenafil or 5 mg vardenafil)‚Äã.¬†

**Salvaging PDE5i ‚ÄúNon-Responders‚Äù**

One of the most significant findings from these studies is that some men who initially do not respond well to on-demand PDE5i therapy can become ‚Äúresponders‚Äù with nightly dosing. This can be attributed to:

1. Progressive endothelial and smooth muscle improvements with continuous use.
2. More frequent nocturnal erections, leading to structural recovery.
3. Avoidance of performance anxiety effects, which can sometimes hinder the effectiveness of on-demand dosing.

In clinical practice, men who have previously failed on PDE5 inhibitors should not be written off as ‚Äúnon-responders‚Äù without first trying a nightly dosing protocol.

**Key Takeaways for Optimising Treatment**

If you have actual erectile dysfunction, obviously don‚Äôt take medical advice from me. I‚Äôm just a dude on the internet with no medical degree. Erectile dysfunction with sudden onset can be a sign of really bad underlying diseases, so don‚Äôt self-treat with tadalafil without first seeing a urologist or even your general practitioner to get a check-up.¬†

Start with a low dose and adjust based on response. Many men benefit from as little as 5 mg tadalafil or 25 mg sildenafil nightly. If we add citrulline to this, and some NAC and some supplements to boost glutathione, we should be golden - we are going further than what has been looked at in medical literature.¬†

If your nocturnal erections do not improve within 2‚Äì4 weeks, increase the dose.

Use NPTR monitoring if possible. NPTR-guided dose adjustments have been shown to enhance long-term outcomes‚Äã. If NPTR is unavailable, subjective improvements in nocturnal and morning erections can serve as a useful proxy. However, I believe we are generally pretty bad at remembering what happens during the night, and we will mostly only vaguely remember what happened in the last 30 minutes or so. I currently have a FirmTech TechRing that I am evaluating, and will be doing a write-up about it (a review)¬†[https://myfirmtech.com/products/the-tech-ring](https://myfirmtech.com/products/the-tech-ring)

¬†\- a kind of ‚Äúfitbit for the dick‚Äù since it records your nocturnal erections and tracks them with a mobile app. I will use it to try and dial in the right dose of tadalafil and citrulline before bed, and also test some other interesting compounds that can tweak nocturnal erections such as Trazodone (works on the serotonin system), a statin (improves endothelial health and NO bioavailability), and some other things as well that my buddy Semtex is recommending me.



On the TSoPE discord, we are discussing a sponsored trial where another NPTR-tracker company (Adam Health) might donate their ‚ÄúAdam Sensor‚Äù ([https://talktoadam.com/adam-sensor](https://talktoadam.com/adam-sensor)

) - I say ‚Äúwe‚Äù but it‚Äôs really Semtex who is the mastermind here - I‚Äôm just happy to tag along, and I can contribute by writing things like this post, for instance.:)¬†



Many men prematurely quit PDE5 inhibitors due to perceived lack of efficacy. This is sad, because benefits may take several months to fully manifest as structural and vascular changes occur. Remodeling of tissues inside the penis takes time - and it will be slower in humans than in rats, of that I‚Äôm sure.¬†

In the Sommers study I wrote about, they used Sildenafil, which I think was a good choice for a study where you want to look at the effect of nocturnal erections on penile health in isolation. Sildenafil has a rapid onset and short half-life, so most of it will be flushed from the system by mid morning for sure if you take it before bed. However, I think we should be using tadalafil instead of sildenafil for three reasons: 1. It will be more active toward the end of the night, where you will have the most nocturnal erections anyway.¬†

2. It tends to have less side effects like nasal congestion, dry eyes, changes in vision due to effects on internal eye pressure, headaches, blushing, etc.¬†

3. It will be active the whole day after, which is neat for spontaneous sex or for PE sessions.¬†¬†

The drawback, of course, is that it‚Äôs more expensive. Cialis is my main expense where PE is concerned.¬†

**Other things to consider:**¬†

**Sleep Optimisation**

Nocturnal erections occur primarily during REM sleep, meaning poor sleep quality can directly reduce their frequency.

Best practices for sleep hygiene include:

\-Consistent sleep schedule (going to bed and waking up at the same time each day).

\-Avoiding blue light exposure from screens at night.

\-Managing stress and reducing caffeine intake in the evening.

\-Huberman says sunlight exposure in the morning is important for the circadian rhythm, so maybe do that as well.¬†

**Milking, RIP and hypoxia-reperfusion**

I previously mentioned that I will be doing some form of rapid interval pumping or ‚Äúmilking‚Äù for the rest of my life, since I regard them as probably the best thing you could possibly do to maintain erectile health, apart from having a healthy lifestyle of course.¬†

**With an auto-Pump that can do rapid intervals**, getting these sessions done is a breeze. Set it and forget it. Cycling that oxygen-rich blood in and out to provide nutrients, antioxidants, while at the same time getting a cyclic stretching stimulus to the endothelial and smooth muscle cells‚Ä¶ if you have paid attention, you will realize that milking and RIP mimic what nocturnal erections do.¬†

**In this post I look closer at how hypoxia can be used strategically**:¬†[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheScienceOfPE/comments/1i0lnsg/the\_role\_of\_vegf\_and\_strategic\_ischemia\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheScienceOfPE/comments/1i0lnsg/the_role_of_vegf_and_strategic_ischemia_in/)¬†

I will not repeat here what I said in that post, I will only reiterate the main point I make:¬†**Ischemia and Reperfusion Dynamics**¬†research shows that ischemia can have a¬†**biphasic effect**: short-duration ischemia¬†**increases VEGF expression and promotes angiogenesis**, while¬†**prolonged ischemia suppresses VEGF and elevates fibrosis markers like TGF-beta1**. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), which involves¬†**cycles of brief ischemia followed by reperfusion**, has been shown to¬†**reduce pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers while enhancing vascular health**. (Damn Karl, do you have to use so much bold typeface? Yup, because all of that was important, lol.)

# Part 3 - Why Nocturnal Erections Matter for Penis Enlargement

Some of the activities we do in PE cause a pro-fibrotic stimulus. Vacuum hanging or compression hanging (which includes extending) done in a manner where your glans gets cold and purple: Hypoxic low-flow state! Extending so your penis gets super thin: Hypoxic low-flow state. Clamping for more than 10 minutes: slightly low-flow state with mild hypoxia. All of these will to some degree up-regulate¬†**transforming growth factor-beta 1.**¬†We have good reasons to want to counteract that with RIP + Milking + Nocturnals-boosting!

But perhaps the most important point that pertains to PE is that we are increasing the volume of our penises, and that means the cavernosal sinusoids need to grow too, and maintain their elasticity. So we want to stimulate VEGF and suppress TGF-Œ≤1 expression to allow this tissue to grow and be in good health so we ‚Äúfill the sausage‚Äù. This helps us close the gap between bpel and bpsfl, and it helps us maintain a good veno-occlusive function when the tunica is growing and requires the CC to grow in order to be able to seal off the subtunical venules.¬†

And finally we have the aspect of ‚Äúshape retention‚Äù. By doing PE work in the evening, you cause your tunica to become expanded, and the more you can allow it to stay in that expanded state, the more likely it is that it will retain the ability to be that size - i.e. it aids the conversion of temp-gains to perma-gains. I have a longer article on shape retention on my blog, and while I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the be-all, end-all of PE, I believe it will probably affect our gain rate to an extent. If I had unlimited privacy and a supply of decently effective non-addictive painkillers I would be injecting my D with PGE1 to induce 4-hour priapisms several times per week for shape retention purposes (and because PGE1 has actually been shown to be anti-fibrotic to the endothelial tissue).

# Some final words

There are things you should do FIRST, before jumping on a protocol of milking, cialis and citrulline.¬†

If you have¬†**metabolic syndrome**¬†with mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulation of appetite due to leptin resistance, and systemic inflammation due to chronically elevated IL-6 and TNF-alpha, resulting in conditions like central adiposity with intrahepatic and visceral fat accumulation, insulin resistance, diabetes type 2, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, obesity, anxiety and depressive disorders, etc, you should 1000% do something about that. I can give detailed instructions, but the gist is to exercise and eat a low-glycaemic diet where you exclude fructose, and to do some occasional water fasting for AMPK / mTOR balancing and stimulation of mitogenesis. GLP1 and GIP receptor agonists such as semaglutide and tirzepatide can be of assistance too, as can a stack of supplements to suppress inflammation and increase mitochondrial function by supporting glutathione function. Note that I didn‚Äôt tell you to ‚Äújust lose weight you lazy bastard‚Äù as some influencers do. That‚Äôs unhelpful. Weight loss happens as a positive side effect of getting metabolically healthy, not the other way around. That is a key insight I wish more people had.

If you smoke or drink alcohol, fucking quit today ffs! Fine, indulge a few times per year‚Äîbut if you have a habit, quit it.¬†

If you have a sedentary lifestyle where you mostly sit at the computer all day and night, this is poor for vascular function and increases inflammatory markers. Take daily walks, most days of the week. Doesn‚Äôt have to be more advanced.¬†

If something is good for your overall health, it also tends to be good for your erectile health, it really is that simple.¬†

When you are doing something about all of these things to improve your dick, you have my permission to start with the cialis-citrulline-milking protocol. :)

I apologise for writing such a long post. I write mostly to organise my own thoughts and as a part of doing my own research, and as a result I tend to be long-winded. I probably made a mistake or two somewhere in this post, and if you help me spot them I would be grateful.

This took me about 24 hours to write, so please leave an upvote and a comment if you found it useful, to help the algorithm pick it up so that more people see it. :)

**Karl ‚Äî over and out.**

1ifhlkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1ifhlkt/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

Background, a year ago my mom (42F) and dad(45M) divorced (a day after my birthday might I add) but they had been seperated for a few months. My dad lives in a new house with his wife (38F, recently married) and my mom now lives in an apartment complex in the same town. The custody schedule is half and half and we meet at a medical center about halfway from his house to hers and vice versa. 

My mom has always hated my stepmom. (I don't like calling her that, so I'll just refer to her by her name, Liz) Understandably so, from what I know my dad was cheating while they were still married with her. Unfortunately, she's hard to hate. She's relatively kind and cooks for me and my  two older and one younger brothers sometimes. I have her number on my phone which my dad and her pay forand we don't necessarily talk on their much anyway. 

Yesterday night, my older brother (15M) wanted to go on a night run, (It was about 10pm and dark out) and said ""Dad would let me."" My mom was actually in a good mood, and instead of takng that to heart she laughed and called my dad in a way to say ""Bet"". My dad didn't answer, so my two brothers (the eldest one, (18M) was at work) rang him as well. he declined as well when I came out of my ro. I tried him and it also went to voicemail. My younger brother(9M), Nathan,  mentioned he sent him a text along the lines of ""hey dad can you call mom for something rq"".

 I replied by saying about  ten minutes earlier I texted dad casually, ""Hey dad"" just to have a conservation. Unfortunately, at that same time, I received a text from Liz. Her full name is Elizabeth but to try and stop my mom from freaking out, i had her contact as ""Elenor"". I quickly but subtly turned off my phone and kept talking but my mom responded, ""did you just get a text from a boy?"" I shook my head and she looked at my phone. I felt the mood shift so fast. ""Elenor? Who's Elenor, OP?"" I replied, ""Elly."" (Elly is the nickname my and my siblings use for Liz because it's how our father introduced her) 

My mom got heated and said ""Her names not Elenor. Why are you texting her?"" ..it was a photo of our dog over there. That's all the text was, but my mother stopped everything and slammed the door to her room. I heard her start weeping and I was sort of frozen. She texted me.

Mom: You are no longer allowed to bring your phone to my house. You can talk to ""Elenor"" when your at her home.

Me: Oh okay

Mom: I'm making you choose me or her you don't get to have a text message with her. 

Me: I can block her

Mom: But you didn't. This is the woman that broke up our family and you're perfectly f*cking fine having a text thread with her. 

*ten minutes later*

Mom: My only daughter, betrayed by my girl

I sent her a screenshot of her contact under ""Unblock caller"" meaning she's blocked and she read it two hours later without a response (I was asleep when she read it)

After she slammed the door, about a half hour later I slowly opened the door and saw her asleep in bed. I decided to leave her to sleep and had a different plan. I grabbed an empty container basket thing and placed a mug (she had already owned) with a k-cup inside, a bracelet I made with her initial, a snack bar she had already had in the pantry, a salty snack she had already had in the pantry and a handwritten letter that basically said ""I'm sorry. I didn't realize it would affect you the way it did. I love you."" 


Yes, it wasn't much at all. But I'd made a similar one before and after she'd used it I said ""sorry it's nothing new"" and she said ""it's the thought that counts"" so I thought she'd might like it. I made it because she goes to work at 7am and it's a Friday night, so I wouldn't be up that early. I wake up at 8:30 ish and check the box. Completely untouched. There's a completely different used K-Cup in the coffee maker. She didn't even touch the note. I felt hurt.

She hasn't come home yet (about 3 hours until her shift ends) so I don't know if she's still upset. I'll probably update once she's back and actually communicates with me, but I need to get something straight so I ask, Am I The A-Hole?",1,1738447209.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Interestingly, we dated about five years ago but broke up due to immaturity and a toxic dynamic. After that breakup, I went through a rough patch, dealing with depression and dark thoughts. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about her, so I reached out, and after a week of talking, we decided to give it another shot.

At first, things were great, but over the last few months, we‚Äôve been arguing constantly. One fight from last year really sticks with me.

She was staying at my place during the holidays when I had to pick up my first car from a dealership a couple of hours away. I don‚Äôt have a license yet, so I went with my dad and uncle. Before leaving, I marinated some beefsteaks and told her she‚Äôd just need to cook them‚Äîthere was rice and veggies ready to go. The trip took longer than expected, and I got home in the afternoon. I texted her updates, but when I got back, she was furious, claiming she had nothing to eat (which wasn‚Äôt true). To be fair, she was on her period, feeling cramps and generally grumpy.

I hadn‚Äôt eaten all day, so I asked if she wanted to join me, my parents, and my uncle for lunch. She refused, so I went without her. After dropping my uncle off and making a quick grocery run with my mom, I got home around 9 PM. She‚Äôd been crying all day, saying she wanted to break up. I was exhausted and didn‚Äôt engage much because she tends to react like this when upset. But then she called her parents, saying I was breaking up with her and bad-mouthing me. That set me off. I told her no one would disrespect me in my own home and asked her to sleep on the couch.

She completely lost it‚Äîcrying, throwing things, calling me names, and accusing me of kicking her out. She called her parents again, packed her stuff, and tried to leave. I stopped her because it was almost midnight, and it wasn‚Äôt safe. Eventually, I apologized, gave her a pillow and blanket (which she threw on the floor), and went to bed. Later, she calmed down, apologized, and said she was just feeling lonely, was on her period, and was hungry.

The next day, I went to her parents‚Äô house to smooth things over. I apologized for the drama, even though I felt like I wasn‚Äôt entirely at fault. She often says we shouldn‚Äôt involve parents in our arguments, yet she did exactly that. We talked it out, and she admitted some blame.

But after that fight, I felt drained. She‚Äôs a grown woman but often acts like she needs constant pampering. It makes sense since she‚Äôs an only child, but it‚Äôs exhausting.

Recently, we had another argument. I had planned to take her out for coffee on Sunday, but she thought I was inviting her over for a meal because I‚Äôd mentioned having steaks in the fridge. I couldn‚Äôt host her because my aunt had just arrived from the US, and I was taking her to a restaurant. I invited my girlfriend to join, but she accused me of always putting her last, not dedicating enough time to her, and even cheating on her (which is ridiculous given how busy I am with work, chores, and driving lessons for the new car).

I‚Äôve cooked for her, cared for her when she was sick, and tried my best, but it never feels like enough. She texted me saying she doesn‚Äôt deserve to be treated this way, that I don‚Äôt let her express her feelings, and that she‚Äôs tired and unsure about our relationship. Honestly, I‚Äôm starting to feel the same.

After everything, I‚Äôm just exhausted. I have so much on my plate, and it feels like she‚Äôs dragging me down instead of being a supportive partner, what should I do?",1,1738446859.0,Advice,1,0.99,False

I am currently using a gaming laptop (RTX 3060 6GB + 32GB RAM + 2TB SSD) in a dual boot windows and ubuntu. Love this computer, but is kinda heavy and I use mostly at home, since the battery drains so fast.

Now I got a job which is kind of a dream job as SW Tester, using the python Ecosystem to Test Android Apps. I have studied python a lot in the past and had some contact with Android with Java, But right now I am rust, so I am thinking in taking some free time to study/workout.

Given that context I am thinking about buying a spare laptop, more portable and light to use to study at the library, and eventually some coffee shop. I would like to ask it is worthy - or if I should use my heavy monster in a place with AC Power outlet and move on,

Also, I wonder if it would be better to get a lightweight PC Laptop and push ubuntu on it (my work SO) or if a Macbook Air 13"" (M2) would be a catch given I have n iPhone Pro.

The main focus is email/web, online classes, Python Coding (VS Code Mostly), Docker and Android Studio.

1ifhcz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/shutterencoder/comments/1ifhcz9/reduce_qr_code_popups_after_closing_program/,Reduce QR code popups after closing program,"I've noticed ShutterEncoder has recently started showing a QR code that links to Stripe when I close the program. I love the idea of reminding people the program exists because of their donations, but I think it appears both too often and becomes an irritant more than anything.

For example, today I opened ShutterEncoder because I wanted to check if the program had the option to complete whatever task I was trying to get accomplished. The program was open less than half a minute and I never intended to complete a task with it. But when I closed the program it was there.

It's also becomes an irritant because when I close a program, I expect the program to close. Maybe a program gets an extra dialog box if I haven't saved anything or it's mission critical and it wants to check I'm okay closing the program. But having to close another dialogue box after I'm done with the program becomes annoying for any program.

One part I love about ShutterEncoder is how quick it is to use and pop up. It's lightweight and has all the options there so I can work quickly with it and nothing gets in the way of what I am trying to accomplish. This popup window for donations works opposite of that and slows me down, because I was just expecting to close one window. Now I have to stop what I was about to do and go close that unexpected popup.

Maybe a better solution would be for the popup to close after a certain amount of time, maybe 30 seconds or so? Or only show the popup a maximum every two weeks in the same scenario it works right now, right after the program closes down. That way you still remind people to donate if they haven't, but the frequency is taken back.

Also having a text explaining the purpose of the box would go a long way too. Something that says ""Hope you enjoyed the software! I keep this free but the maintenance and upkeep are not unfortunately. Buy me a cup of coffee to keep ShutterEncoder working"" would be short and sweet and explain what this QR code is for.

Just some thoughts, but every time that box pops up, even if it's after a super short usage of ShutterEncoder, is just a little push away from what makes this program so awesome and recommendable.

Can someone who has done some or all of the destinations provide a comment about this plan?

We are looking to experience and learn about Colombian culture, explore the nature and we love the sea in general. We prefer smaller towns to big cities. Not at all into drinking or clubbing.

The plan is defined based on where we sleep that night:
* Feb 15 - Bogota
    * My friend will arrive the day before while I will land at 4AM
* Feb 16 - Bogota
* Feb 17 - Palomino
    * 3:20 PM flight to Santa Marta from Bogota, make way to Palomino before EOD
* Feb 18 - Palomino
* Feb 19 - Santa Marta
    * Daytrip to PNN Tayrona
* Feb 20 - Cartagena
    * squeeze daytrip to Minca here if possible
    * bus to Cartagena
* Feb 21 - Cartagena
* Feb 22 - Providencia
    * AM flights: Cartagena to San Andres, San Andres to Providencia
* Feb 23 - Providencia
* Feb 24 - Providencia
* Feb 25 - Medellin
    * Flights: Providencia to San Andres, San Andres to Medellin
* Feb 26 - Medellin
* Feb 27 - Coffee Axis (Salento)
    * Flight: Medellin to Armenia flight
* Feb 28 - Coffee Axis (Salento)
    * Daytrip to Cocora Valley
* March 1 - Bogota
    * 5:30 PM flight from Armenia to Bogota
* March 2 - Bogota
    * My flight departs at 9AM, my friend's at 9PM

This is what I put together after doing some research online. I'm open ears to any suggestions you might have and until we start booking places to stay I can change any part of it. However these are the parts that looked really cool and would hate to miss:
* PNN Tayrona
* Cocora Valley
* Providencia (this part was the most difficult to fit in and I understand if you suggest to get rid of it, however we both thought it would be really cool to have a trip within a trip by taking a 3 day break in the middle of nowhere, just snorkeling and enjoying the beach)

I used flights wherever I though the extra money is reasonable to save us time and make the trip more pleasant

Full context: This trip is my delayed ""bachelor party"" and also a gift to my friend for his 30th birthday. We have known each other since we were 2, traveled together extensively, our favorite trip was 2.5 weeks in Brazil (Rio, Salvador do Bahia, Ilha Grande) back in 2016. We are trying to relive some of that with this trip.

We now live on different continents, I recently got married and I have a kid on the way so it's very realistic that this is our last chance for a trip together. Because of that, I don't mind pushing with the itinerary to make the trip truly epic and something we remember for the years to come.

[breville bambino plus]","Being new to the espresso game  I have only had to dial in like 2 different beans, both medium-dark. Yesterday I pull my first shot of new beans (vail mountain French roast)  I just got from the supermarket. 18g dose, I think my encore was set to about 12-13. And it was perfect, my favorite shot I had pulled yet. Felt super lucky thinking I didn‚Äôt need to dial it in. 

Fast forward to today and doing the same method as yesterday it choked my machine up pretty much, and the coffee was only coming out of one side of the portafilter. Thinking I just screwed up the prep, tried again, same result. Then I tried it at a few different grinds (going more coarse), same result. Tried what‚Äôs left of some other beans and it comes out fine. Then I try to decrease the dose (10 settings) on the new beans and grind finer and then the coffee came out way too fast. Thought that was weird so increased the dose back to 18g, 10 setting grind on the encore, and it seemed to pull just fine. 

I don‚Äôt understand how or what issues I was having, at all. My prep did not change. It‚Äôs even more confusing to me that the end solution ended up being grinding finer at the same dose all along? I really don‚Äôt think my prep was any different, but maybe something was off. What do y‚Äôall think?

I also lose a lot of weight because I don‚Äôt eat during my period. It has affected my life, work, and school because I often have to miss days due to how unwell I feel.

I have very little understanding of periods, and it kind of upsets me. I do a lot of research, but I seem to fit into so many different categories that it‚Äôs overwhelming. When I went to a doctor, they quickly dismissed my concerns, saying it was normal and that I should just go on birth control.

Me and this particular VP catch up daily and last week I found an email in her inbox that was titled with my name sent to herself and basically all the things that were outstanding but she also mentioned ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I do with my time‚Äù & that I‚Äôm ‚Äúvery passive‚Äù.

I feel it‚Äôs also good to mention that last month she was telling my manager she notices when I‚Äôm on holiday aka the difference with cover and with me - she notices the impact I make and that she admires the way I carry myself.

I told my manager and showed her the email and she agreed it was really shitty of her and my manager gave the heads up to my VP that I‚Äôd seen this email in her mailbox and the VP let me know and asked if we could go grab a coffee so she could explain herself - we squashed it but it‚Äôs left a very very sour taste in my mouth and I‚Äôm contemplating on leaving.

However, the craving of some nice, aromatic coffee got better of me and I made a smooth coffee with just a pot, water and coffee grounds.

Process:

\- Get some water on a pot and start heating it

\- Once it heats for 2 mins on a high flame, put 1 to 2 spoons of coffee grounds. I am using my moka pot grind for this.

\- As soon as the grounds are put, the water starts to boil. Let it boil for a minute (may a bit longer for stronger coffee) on a low flame and stir it with a spoon for a couple of times.

\- Once done, pour some cold water over it.

\- Use a channi (sieve) over your cup and pour the coffee slowly.

\- If you like it hotter like me, microwave the cup for 30 seconds.

In less than 5 minutes, a great, smooth, aromatic and kicking coffee is ready!

Early last year i opted to spend my life savings ($7200) on a brazillian butt lift plastic surgery. It was my way to ""treat myself"" post a ugly brake up with my long term boyfriend. After we went our seperate ways I did the single rounds for a while but always knew I was looking for something serious so I opted for the surgery to boost my confidence on the dating circuit as well as hopefully do better as I was striking out on all of the apps. 

My mother criticized me intensely for the operation but I always felt she was overstepping bounds as she is solely able to take care of HERSELF from her SS payment and doesnt contribute a cent to me or my daughter. I also did not assume debt as a result of the surgery and made sure to thoroughly budget it out so my daughter would not go without heat and the like.

The operation went off without a hitch and 6 weeks later I was healed and settled. After a few more months of dating around I met Miguel who was a attractive man who no was not rich but had done nicely for himself and would be able to contribute to my daughter. I was transparent from the start about my intentions for a long term relationship, my daughter, and my need for a financially independant man. We got along great at first and seemed to be looking for the same things. 

Saying Miguel enjoyed my ""enhancements"" was an understatement he couldn't keep his hands off of them smelled them and stared all the time. He even would come home with brand new grey workout shorts and have me wear them while cooking dinner or brewing coffee. and he would stare. At first I was unbothered by this as it was refreshing to be around a more sexual man than my ex.

After six months of dating I introduced Miguel to my daughter and they got along well. At this point I was really starting to envision myself marrying this man and began to settle into the more ""settled"" stage of a relationship where it feels as though you can build a home. A few more months of calm passed before my car broke down and needed a costly repair. I had been financially struggling for a large portion of our relationship but never felt comfortable asking for money in large sums only accepting paid for dates and takeout and the exercise shorts. Smaller things like that. 

However at this point in the relationship it felt comfortable to ask for money and I also felt it would be a final ""test"" so to speak to see if he was truly committed I did some calculations and asked him if he could pay for my car repair. Miguel seemed offended that I asked and immediatly was standoffish. I got heated and told him that the repair was roughly the same cost as my ""enhancements"" and its the least he could do to cover it he could look at it like he was paying for my enhancements. He got very upset and things turned ugly from there in terms of a verbal fight. I threatened to  get the implants removed and he taunted me saying he knew I wouldnt and for anyone who knows me that was the last thing he should have done.

I have emotionally wrestled with if getting these implants was the right decision from the start. I carry a lot of guilt around treating myself and looked at this like an opportunity to finally choose myself but of course it didnt go right and at this point I was fed up with it all and just wanted this nightmare behind me. I saved up my paychecks paid for my car with a credit program and that August scheduled a removal procedure. I was quoted at $8900 for the removal including anesthesia hospital stay and all. I had to pay for the procedure on credit but felt comfortable assuming the debt. Assuming I didnt encounter any large unexpected expense I was slated to pay off the debt in total by late 2028.

The surgery date came and long story short the procedure was botched. I was left in pain and with an unsightly and uneven backside. Miguel began to completely lose interest in the bedroom and from here I knew it was the beginning of the end. I felt so heartbroken and stupid that he loved my implants so much but when I really needed him he became so cold.

My mental health began to decline and I knew I had to get this fixed to regain my confidence so I researched and scheduled a revision and was quoted at $9500 for the procedure. The revision occured back in January and I am near the end of my healing period. The revision was a great success and now I am back to my normal and somewhat curvy self LOL. So TLDR over 20 grand to realize I love myself without surgery and look almost the same as before this nightmare started. My mother is on the ""i told you so train"" and guilting me often and I feel so stupied but yet justified in the whole episode. I have since completely moved on from Miguel and am working on myself at the moment.

I‚Äôm more introverted & shy by nature and, while I‚Äôve always longed for one, I don‚Äôt have a solid core group of friends. I have my best friend, but she‚Äôs currently living in another state. I‚Äôve always struggled with making friends (I tend to overthink a lot and have anxious tendencies) and seldomly do I really feel like I‚Äôve found my community/people, and even more so post-grad (it‚Äôs felt so disheartening at times).¬†

I‚Äôve been really trying to put myself out there the past 1-2 years to try to make new friends. The friendships I have right now are more one on one friendships where there‚Äôs little to no overlap between them and I feel like a good chunk are still in the surface level/beginning stages. You know, the ones where you‚Äôd just go on a coffee date with and catch up every now and then.

I enjoy dressing up and have always liked the idea of a big fun dinner/event for my birthday, but have refrained from doing so in the past because I was always worried it‚Äôd be too awkward since it‚Äôd basically be a bunch of strangers meeting each other.

However, I thought that I‚Äôd just say fuck it and finally just host the birthday dinner I‚Äôve always wanted and invite all of my friends (and my boyfriend). All of my friends that are nearby are girls (around my age) and I would say half are in relationships and half are single. I was thinking that I‚Äôd extend the option of them being able to bring plus ones as well, whether their partner or a friend and it would end up being a good mix of guys & girls. I thought it‚Äôd be a fun way for my friends to meet each other and for people to meet new people in general. The only thing is some of these friendships are on the newer side and also, some of my friends are very different from each other and some are also more introverted/shy. But also, I‚Äôm kind of tired of waiting to have the life experience I want and feel that maybe it‚Äôs time to just create it‚Ä¶

I was wondering what are the predictions for the group and he told me what he thinks will happen this year. Some may feel a bit far fetched from the way he said it, so you may want to take those predictions with a pinch of salt.

His predictions include these:

- Dark Horse will continue to make all their money on manga and art book issues with the occasional Mignola or Sakai thing popping up.

- Freemode will continue to shit on North America as a territory by letting Josh Fairhurst continue to be a vainglorious bitch ass motherfucker. (His words, not mine!) 
Looking at the current political landscape, he can't say they don't deserve it.

- The only notable thing CDE will be attached to is the news that they will get Aspyr and Beamdog (and maybe what's left of Lost Boys) when the split is formally finished, and a passing acknowledgement by WayForward when Square-Enix announces Gex 4 (which by the way WILL come out before The Re-Run Trilogy, because the Arzette's guy can only accomplish so much doing Gex and Bubsy at the same time while Josh and MVG jerk each other off, which is what I was told)

- Plaion will continue to be a bloated that can't decide if they want to be movies, games, or just middle men, and they'll probably kill Spot Film in their confusion and nobody in the English speaking world will notice for months at a time. Also, they'll get TripWire apparently as a FIFTH publishing arm.

- DECA will fully swallow Arc/Cryptic and Zen Studios. Crazy Labs will find new ways to make children stupid. (By that, he was referring to the fact that Crazy Labs makes mobile games which are described as ""brainrot"", if you saw those ads on YouTube.)

- Coffee Stain will be unable to put a ring on Iron Gate fully still, but may inherit Tuxedo Labs or 34 Big Things. Neither of these will increse output productivity.

- Amplifier will continue barely exisiting despite it all, riding most;y on ACE and Tarsier, and Hermitage's weird board game thing will probably blow up in their face. Kavalri will be the real question mark of ""How are you still alive?"" of all of them though

- THQNordic will be stuck leaning HARD of the Gothic Remake and the new SpongeBob game, neither of which he's praticularly concerned with because he's actually more interested in their ""Weappy saved our asses early on letting us take majority of the This is the... series, so we gotta put full thrust into promoting their weird over budget passion project"" game, Henry Hatsworth in Eldritch Donkey Kong County, as he puts it. We may get a release date for Space for Sale, but we are not seeing Black Forest's Last Ronin at all until Darksiders 4 gets a release date, and Wreckreation will be released at the same time as Wreckfest 2; confusing all audiences, fucking over both games, and showing they learned NOTHING from Outcast: A New Beginning and Alone in the Dark 2024. (Again, his words, not mine.)

I have a feeling that he has a ""dude, trust me"" energy to it, despite his long history following the Embracer Group rabbit hole. Do you think any of these predictions will come true, or do any of you have more realistic predictions for Embracer in 2025?",2,1738444810.0,embracergroup,0,1.0,False
1ifgot2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ifgot2/a_house/,a House,"A few months ago, I started taking walks at night.¬†

I had not been getting out much since I started my new job, rented a place in a nice, calm part of town and finally got my life something resembling together, after a long period of drifting aimlessly. My whole life, really. Paying the bills on a spacious studio apartment meant sinking every moment I had into work and chores, and I was starting to feel the restlessness that always came to me after too much time spent in cubicles and walls that started closing in on me no matter how nice the wallpaper, and I needed to get out.

It was a nice change of pace, having some time to myself to process and grab a smoke while looking at a clear sky full of stars. My idea of going out used to be getting trashed and spending the next day recovering so I could do it all over again, but I was getting used to crisp air and listening to the thoughts in my head for once, even if they‚Äôre sometimes biting.

It‚Äôs a nice neighborhood, like I said, with lots of rustic houses lit up by string lights in the gardens, and a few apartment buildings like my own strewn about, so I‚Äôm never scared to wander as late as I want, listening to some new album I haven‚Äôt had the time to catch up on, or trusty old Cure if nothing else. There are never very many people out this time of year, which makes it peaceful, and the occasional dog-walker or late shift worker always shares a friendly smile, and I‚Äôm left to stroll the tiny park areas, enjoying the way nighttime always makes everything more cinematic and moody than the gray daylight of autumn. Slowly I‚Äôve mapped out the entire area on my lazy strolls, taking this way or that, venturing into new, winding streets and always finding something picturesque to see ‚Äì an unfamiliar greenhouse or a frosty duck pond. I‚Äôm not entirely familiar with the area just yet to where I don‚Äôt sometimes get a little lost, but I‚Äôve got a pretty good sense of direction and I‚Äôm getting there.¬†

Sounds idyllic, I can hear you say. Why am I writing about this boring stuff?

Well, the other night I found a house I‚Äôd never seen before.

It was a regular house -- it is a regular house, perfectly ordinary and normal, if a little out of place with its stark white paint among the red-tiled and wooden-knotted styles of the rest of the neighborhood, but there's all kinds nestled in there. My favorite is a gray-stained one with a roof the size and sharpness of an old church, and a yellow, almost Victorian style one with a little turret.¬†

I couldn‚Äôt tell you why the white-painted house stuck out to me, or why a strange feeling made my skin crawl when I saw it. I just knew it felt unpleasant.

It‚Äôs situated at the end of a bend in the road, where the woods behind it meet a highway far away behind the thick of pine trees, and it stands just a little distant to the rest of the neighborhood. the streetlights stop reaching because there's nothing to light up over there. They're doing some construction at the end of the road that looks perpetually not in progress, just scraps of metal and hardware stacked and waiting, and it‚Äôs the one area of the neighborhood that doesn‚Äôt feel homely. Maybe that's what got to me, that sort of liminal feeling that only industrial structures at night give you.

In any case, after the first time it caught my eye, I started walking past it every time I went out. I don‚Äôt know why. Oddities have always drawn me in, and there‚Äôs a pleasant little rush in finding strange things at a safe distance, this tiny five minute moment every night that would intrigue me at the start of my walk and get the gears going in my head for some short story or other before I turned back to my quaint neighborhood.

*Theres something wrong with that house*, I‚Äôd think every time I passed it, smiling a little at my own silliness. *It's too still. Too stark, somehow. Why are the lights never on?*

Frankly, it was a good question. Even though I'd start walking in the evening, I still had to get up in the morning, so it wasn't like I was out there at three A.M. or anything, and the lights were always on in every other house I‚Äôd see. Someone would be preparing for bed, watching TV lazily in the living room, scraping the leftovers from their dinner into a container in the kitchen.

I like watching people. I like throwing quick glances at windows, catching glimpses of their day to day. I live a mostly solitary life, and there‚Äôs something fascinating to me about people, their habits and their things, their choice of bookshelves and lamps and pictures lining their walls, the life they‚Äôve accumulated over the years and inhabit daily without thinking about it. It says so much about them, these boxes they live in, their places of safety. I‚Äôve always felt like a solitary observer of everyone around me, taking quiet notes of little details like that, an explorer in a strange world of domesticity I‚Äôve never had myself.

Put it like that, maybe I‚Äôm just lonely.

In any case, this house had none of that. Nothing for me to see, to analyze and turn to stories in my head. If there was furniture, I couldn‚Äôt see it because these people went to bed at eight every night, and there was nothing on the front lawn, not even a car or a watering hose, just well-kept green grass that felt bare-boned¬† somehow. Like someone doing the very least of the concept of living. Like someone playing house with no imagination.

Listen, I‚Äôm an overthinker, so take all of this with a grain of salt.

I guess that's why I kept obsessing over it, why I kept wandering by first at the start of my route and then sometimes to finish, trying to get anything out of that place at all. Any semblance of personality, of that essence that any other home would give me. Who were the people that lived there? You'd think no one did, but someone kept that lawn well maintained, someone would periodically open and close the blinds on the second floor. I walked by it once in daylight before work, and the blinds in one small window were closed where they had been open the night before, so someone had to have done that. Still no lights on, and the windows were just dark and empty as usual, contrasted by the pristine white paint, as if daylight just couldn't penetrate that place. A child's drawing of a house before they'd gotten bored and wandered off, not bothering to fill in those classical awkward squares for curtains and crude flowerpots.

Just emptiness.¬†

Interesting to me, because emptiness like that isn‚Äôt easily achieved. We leave some kind of traces of ourselves everywhere, whether we like to or not, simply by living. Even the trees outside were anonymous. No fruit, or markings on the bark. No treehouses, no decorations. Just trees, in the most basic sense of the word. It made me think of a poem I liked: *when all you need to know of a place is, do people live there. If they do, you know everything*. I felt like I knew nothing. Not about the house, nor its inhabitants. Nothing about life in general to be honest.

Who keeps a whole house just to visit on occasion? What house would stay uninhabited for long, especially such a spacious one in such a charming neighborhood? Someone had to live there, but they seemed to never be there, and I'm sure that once this thought hit you, you'd also be intrigued. Maybe not as much as me, but you haven't been there.

You haven't felt the nothingness.

I like horror. I love horror actually, it's my favorite genre when it comes to films, books, games, you name it. Creepy podcasts about monsters from folklore, unsettling historical facts about torture and plagues, even just unsolved stories like the Dyatlov pass is my jam, and I‚Äôve read every creepypasta under the sun. It's been a rough time in my life lately, before I finally got this job, and my last relationship was a trainwreck I still haven't recovered from and maybe never will. I haven't been sleeping well... Ever, really. I romanticise things to cope with my fucked up childhood, and I‚Äôve always made up little stories in my head to make the world around me seem less daunting, or more exciting, or just to be anywhere else than where I am. I've been on antidepressants since July. The same kind my mother used to take.

The same kind of ghosts that plague my mind also haunted hers.

I'm telling you all of this to be fully honest, so you know that I have a vivid imagination, that I try to escape the pressing bleakness of reality as much as I can, that I'm not doing well and never really have. So you know, that I'm an unreliable narrator. It feels important, it feels clean, that you know as well as me that it all could have been a trick of my mind, that it all could have a perfectly reasonable, normal explanation. Though I still can't explain what happened that night.

I still don‚Äôt really understand.

I was walking a little later than usual, nearer to midnight, because it was a Friday and I didn't have work the next day, but I'd had a mess of a workday earlier. The kind that never seems to end, where things just keep stacking up and everything around you that usually runs smoothly keeps failing, until you think you'll never get out. I finally escaped sometime after eight, and got home to make dinner in a pissed off mood, and burnt that too. It was just one of those days.

My walks were sanctuary though, and I still dragged my ass out into the crisp air after lying around feeling sorry for myself on the couch for a bit, finding nothing good to watch on the TV and hitting every wrong note on my beat up guitar.¬†

To amuse myself, as usual, I decided to take a tour of the House. Since my discovery of it, it has permanently become the House, capital letters, in my mind. An entity. My own private little Scooby Gang Mystery. The world's most boring horror story, where the only horror was the absence of things instead of anything horrific that was actually there.

Well, until that night, anyway.

That night, I saw something. Something, finally, in the little window where the blinds would move where nothing else did. An outline, a shape, almost imperceptible in the dark, but unmistakably there.

Remember, this is not a spooky neighborhood, and there are still streetlights somewhere in the distance and a neighbouring house, even if it's farther away than usual. There was just enough light from the outside, to make out that shape in the window, and I didn't immediately find it unsettling. It's a damned weird house in my mind, but I can still understand the difference between what's real and what isn't. At least I think I can. I'm not so sure anymore.

""Oh, someone does live there,"" was my immediate thought. ""there goes the theory that it‚Äôs uninhabited or for sale.""

My second thought, after getting a little closer, was, ""are they looking at me?""

I couldn't tell, because the shape in the window was all black, something just a little darker than its surrounding. The blinds were pulled all the way up, fully exposing the glass of it, and behind it I could just see someone vaguely human-shaped. Long hair, when I got closer. I think they were looking at me, because I've never felt so watched in my whole life. So seen, so exposed. I can't explain it, because how could I, but it was that prickly feeling up the back of your neck, hair-raising thing that you sometimes get, and then you turn around and someone who was watching you at the bus stop or coming up behind you on a running trail appears, and you think nothing of it. It happens. Just an old reflex from more animalistic times.

It was that, but turned up a million times stronger. Unbearable, almost. More like what a deer caught in headlights must feel just before the car hits and breaks their bones.

I got closer. The shape didn't move. I walked all the way up beside the House where the road bends, and the shape did not move. Did not fix anything in the window, because there was nothing to fix. Didn‚Äôt fiddle with the blinds, didn't turn away when they saw me approach and stare. Just stood there, perfectly still, as still as the rest of that House, as still as everything in that weird bubble universe of a garden. Thinking about it then, I realized I'd never seen the trees sway in any breeze.

It stood there as if its only purpose was to stand there. It stood there, as if it was waiting for something.¬†

It stood there, as if it was waiting for me.

I walked by.

What the hell else was I supposed to do? Stay there, staring back like a freak? People are allowed to stand in their windows, they're allowed to do whatever they want in their homes. I was the weirdo out there, making up nonsense because my mind won't ever shut up, and no matter what, what I felt was irrelevant.

I walked by, because I was scared.

I couldn't get home fast enough, all the time feeling like that watched feeling never left me, that thing boring its gaze into the back of neck. I don't know why I thought of it as a thing. It was a person, clearly, but it was a person as much as that House was a house. rudimentarily. Barely. Emptily.

I got home and I drank three beers, not giving a shit about the warnings on my meds, and fell asleep watching something stupid on TV, some boring talk show about local politics droning me into sleep with its mundanity.

You'd think I had nightmares. That my spooky brain would take this fucked up event and turn it into a feast of horrors, but I didn‚Äôt dream anything. I woke up, and the space between the previous night and late morning was entirely empty to me. Not the kind of blackout you get from being drunk, not that. I‚Äôve had my fair share of those over the years and this wasn't blissful darkness. I still had the inexplicable feeling that I had dreamt, that I had been somewhere, the way you go to places in your mind when you dream and understand that time has passed, but that the place was a nothing where something should have been. Just emptiness. Just the House, I suppose.

It was still enough to amuse me. I don't scare easily. You don't get through the kind of shit I've been through by being easily scared. People do, memories sometimes, that cloying feeling of pathological unwellness that rots you from the inside. The hard truths in life do, like the fact that sometimes the people who love you the most will cut you the deepest because they just can‚Äôt help themselves. Not people in windows. Not scary stories. Not made up things. Not the things that should scare me, that are designed to. Real intimacy, now that's fucking terrifying if you ask me. This? This was funny. It was exciting. It was something that wasn't boring and mundane when everything else seemed to be, and honestly I couldn't wait to go back.

Now I know why people in horror movies act like idiots. Because they are, because theyre fucked up, because we all have something in our heads that wont let us rest. Because we never quite outgrow that urge to touch a hot stove just to see what happens, just to feel our skin sizzle a little. Some of us don't even have anyone to teach us not to. Some of us have our hands pressed against the burner and held there, and we learn to like it.

So, back I went. I pretended to have a whole Saturday full of things that normal people do,¬† washing clothes and dishes and catching up on some vacuuming, taking a long bath and reading a magazine, messing around on the computer for a bit. All the while pretending like I wasn't waiting, like I wasn't in standby mode until night time, when I would go back to that House and maybe catch a glimpse of my watcher again. More realistically see nothing and realize that I didn't even see anything the night before. To be honest, I'd also had a beer with dinner. Maybe two, I don't recall. Actually, I‚Äôd like not to recall, but I know.

As soon as time came around, around the same time as the night before, I was out the door and lighting up a smoke, saying hello to the rare neighbor on their way to town to have a pub-night with friends or the like. It really is a sleepy little place, and I'm glad, because too much noise and hustle drives me crazy. I hated living in the city. Here I feel like a ghost, a dark, ill-fitting shape of something that's awkwardly settled into an easier life, a vampire in retirement. Out of place, but content.

The House was of course where it always was, waiting for me. Blank, pale face with black, unseeing eyes. nothing in the window. I remember actually sighing, in relief of disappointment, I'm not sure which. And so I stood there, in the dark, by the still trees and my still, empty House and felt a little dejected. A little stupid. I lit a cigarette, and smoked for a bit, still enjoying the vast night, the moon and the stars. I cheered myself up by thinking that it was the weekend after all, and I could play some guitar when I came home, maybe call my friend I haven't heard from in ages and see if she was doing better. I stood there for a while, finishing my cigarette and lighting another, fiddling with my phone. Maybe I was waiting, truth be told.

I was selecting an album to play and stubbing the cigarette out on the ground, and in that movement I saw it, out of the corner of my eye. The shape.

It was standing there again, so still and so dark, and the prickly feeling at the back of my neck came back. I was pretty close to the House, closer than I'd ever gotten before, almost to the gate, and I suppose I wouldn't have heard the blinds open, it's a small noise, but... I think I might have. I should have. I have really good hearing, hypervigilance my doctor calls it, attuned to a pin drop on the floor above me sometimes.¬†

To the smallest cough, to what feels like peoples thoughts sometimes. It's the world's most annoying superpower, and I always have to plug my ears to get any sleep if I don‚Äôt manage to focus on something lulling from the TV. I could hear the faint sounds of music from the house way up the street, and the highway was a muffled buzz masked by the woods, and I could hear all these things as clearly as I always can, but I didn't hear the blinds open, even though I was just a few feet from the source. It's... Whatever, that's normal, I don't know why I'm focusing on that right now.

I'd periodically been looking up at the House, at the window, and a minute ago the blinds that had been closed were open, and the shape was there. It was looking at me.

I knew it was looking at me.

I stood there, frozen for a while, staring up at the thing staring at me, wondering if I was losing my mind with the detached amusement that thought always brings me, and then I shook my head to snap myself out of it.

And the thing shook its head too.

It shook its head like I had shaken mine, black hair swaying a little, and I felt oddly sick. I don't know why. That deer in the headlights feeling was more of a mouse in the lights of semi truck-strong, and I felt... calm. I know that doesnt make sense with everything else I'm telling you here, but it‚Äôs what I felt. Something had gone still inside of me. Completely still, and... empty. It crept into me, like a foreign force, like something outside of me, winding its tendrils from the dark and into my body. It wasn't mine. It came from the House.

I walked up a step. I walked another step. Until I was pressed against the gate, against the unusually tall rails that looked almost like prison bars in the shadows, until my hands were pressed against them and I tried my hardest to squint. To see. It was useless.¬†

There was no light. There was no light at all, and there was none coming from the streetlights that were too far away, or the house up the road that was closest, and it didn't reach here and that wasn't why I could see the shape. I dont know why I thought that was why I could see it the night before, I dont know why I thought that when the light was coming from behind it, only the light wasn‚Äôt light, it was more an absence of dark, just slightly lesser than the dark of the rest of that fucking damned place, and I could see the shape because

because it wanted me to see it.

I tilted my head, trying to make sense of it.

It tilted its head.¬†

At the same time.

No latency.

I ran.

There's no way around it, I hightailed out if there was something chasing me. I'm not a complete moron, there's still some survival skills left in me, rusty as they may be. I ran all the way home, up the stairs and slammed the door behind me, gasping for air against it. My lungs spasmed, and I had a stitch in my side. *I should really stop smoking*, I thought.

I did all the things I said I would do the night before. I cooked, I cleaned, and I called my friend. She seemed far away in that way she always is, but she was glad to hear from me. She let me rattle on about my job and how awful I found it really, in my heart of hearts, and the new apartment that makes it all worth it, makes me feel like a new person. Someone decent and respectable and all those things I told myself once that I didn't need, but secretly craved somewhere inside all along.

It was good to speak to her, good to laugh a little about stupid things. She did seem better, I could hear it in her voice and the way she spoke about the new succulents she had just bought, about how she looked forward to the coming spring and how it would bring with it some much needed sunshine. I hope she stays that way. I hope she stays clean this time.

I stayed away from any mention of the House, pushing it down to the deepest recesses of my mind, where it laid festering like an infected wound all the same. I remained in some strange way frozen all day, having a hard time making any simple decisions, from how to fold the laundry to what to drink in the evening. Coffee or tea? Coffee would keep me up, give me energy for the night. It wouldn‚Äôt let me sleep, though, and I knew I needed rest more than anything.

I chose coffee, and already then I must have known. The whole day had been a state of denial. Each task I set up for myself was another way to bargain, to plead for one more moment of normalcy before the inevitable came.¬†

I knew I was going back.

In July 2024, my father was diagnosed with stage 4 appendiceal cancer mats in his stomach. Prognosis is palliative chemo to maintain/decrease symptom presentation. Some background, I‚Äôm an only child and my mother passed in 2022. It‚Äôs really just me and my father. We do not have tangible help nearby from anyone. Occasional meal drops from friends which is always appreciated. I live about 20 minutes away and have been managing all appointments, communication, and visit a few times per week. 

He completed 11 rounds of FOLFOX chemo. Main symptom is fatigue overall as lack of appetite. Same week of his 11th round, he started vomiting dark blood (‚Äúcoffee grounds‚Äù color). He had a GI bleed, no one knows exactly what the cause since he‚Äôs on blood thinners, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure but ultimately it was addressed and he was out of the hospital in 4 days. 

He was even weaker the 1.5 weeks after h the hospital stay due to low hemoglobin still so the oncologist decided to pause treatment and ordered home based PT and started him on Lasix for his increased edema in ankles/feet. A few days later (yesterday) , something seemed off, took him to the clinic and he has a UTI. Now in need of full support due to incontinence, extreme lethargy, etc. can‚Äôt manage his meals, starting to need reminders/assistance for ADL routines since hospitalization. 

My husband and I are now sleeping at my father‚Äôs home until further notice and I‚Äôm in the process of getting private pay home attendants for at least a couple hours per day starting this week for when I‚Äôm at work. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if we‚Äôre in the decline. It feels like we are but I know people say to be hopeful. I just see how hard it is for him to regain his strength with his body already bombarded with cancer/chemo. All of these additional conditions/diagnoses on top of a weakened immune system seem to be disastrous.

I‚Äôm scared but trying to wear all the hats at once. I‚Äôm about to start a new position in 1 month within my job that is WFH 2 days a week to be more present for him but I‚Äôm just nervous things are changing fast. 

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for reassurance that I‚Äôm covering all my bases to best support him. Or also if there‚Äôs anything else I should be looking out that make it more clear that maybe hospice is the next route. ",3,1738444597.0,CancerFamilySupport,1,1.0,False

Kramer brings his photography portfolio with him when he visits Elaine at work. Peterman browses the photographs and is impressed by the photos of George that Kramer took in ‚ÄúThe Package.‚Äù Peterman hires Kramer as a photographer for their new line of clothing focusing on Body Positivity and wants George to be the model.

George‚Äôs scheme backfires when a plus-sized model also hired for the catalog uses the same trick on him. George rejects her, resulting in everyone calling him superficial and he is blacklisted from the modeling industry.

Jerry, still suspicious of his girlfriend, fears that everything they do together is actually a plot to kill him in a way that looks like an accident.

Venvanse is a tricky medication that heavily depends on your routine and countless other factors to work at its best. Because of that, the effect feels like a rollercoaster‚Äîsome days are good, others not so much.

One thing I‚Äôve confirmed through my continuous use is that my body doesn‚Äôt seem to metabolize or absorb Venvanse properly if I haven‚Äôt had my **morning dump**. If I‚Äôm constipated or have a slow digestive system‚Äîwell, you get what I mean.

On days when I don‚Äôt ‚Äúclear things out‚Äù in the morning and take it anyway, the effect is way weaker. But on days when I do manage to go first and then take it, the effect is much stronger‚Äîjust the way we like it.

Now, in my case, the one thing that *always* fixes constipation and ensures everything is cleared out every single morning is my **holy black coffee**. I drink it, and within minutes, I gotta run‚Äînever fails.

The problem is that I‚Äôve noticed coffee also affects Venvanse‚Äôs effectiveness for me, **but in a negative way‚Äîit weakens the effect**.

So for me, drinking coffee in the morning solves the first issue I mentioned, but at the same time, it also reduces Venvanse‚Äôs effectiveness‚Äîso it kind of cancels out.

And yeah, I realized that the days I get the *best* effect from Venvanse are when I **don‚Äôt drink coffee in the morning but still manage to go to the bathroom beforehand**.

The issue is, I can‚Äôt make that happen every day. Coffee was the one thing that guaranteed it for me, but without it, it‚Äôs just luck whether I can go in the morning or not. And so far, the only thing I‚Äôve found that **works 100% of the time** to fix morning constipation is coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs never let me down in that sense. But on the flip side, it messes with the medication‚Äôs effectiveness, as I already mentioned.

With that said, does anyone know of another ‚Äúformula‚Äù that guarantees a morning bathroom trip **every** day just like coffee does‚Äîbut **without negatively affecting Venvanse‚Äôs intensity**? (If it actually boosts the effect, even better! Hehe)",3,1738444463.0,VyvanseADHD,4,1.0,False

The only problem is that it‚Äôs very basic!! It goes like this‚Ä¶

For starchy carbs:-
Cook a massive batch of white rice and keep 4 portions to eat and freeze another 12 x 150g portions for the rest of the month. This is made the Persian way so it is very tasty rice!
Cook a batch of baby potatoes twice a week which gives me 8 portions.

For protein:-
Rump steak
Chicken breast
Venison steak
Tuna steak
Wild caught salmon

For veggies:-
Frozen bags of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, green beans, peas etc etc all take 5 mins to defrost.

Breakfast mon - Fri:-
Prep 5 x overnight oats with:- oats, milk, yogurt, kefir, chia seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, goji berries, sesame seeds, scoop of whey, salt.

Lunch mon - Thu:-
Prep 4 x pasta salad (3 variations - tuna, chicken, egg)

Breakfast weekends:-
Scrambled eggs on toast with a protein shake

Lunch wekends:-
Have carbs, protein, veggies mix and match from above.

Morning supplements:-
500ml water with 5g creative + ELMT electrolytes

Evening supplements:-
2 x omega 3 tabs
1 x vit d tab

2 black coffees a day.

Protein shake and banana if my workout doesn‚Äôt fall before a meal time.

Exercise routine:-
Mon - lower strength training (alternating between heavy weights and low weights each month)
Tue - upper strength training (same as above)
Wed - treadmill sprints
Thu - long zone 2 run
Fri - rest
Sat - limb strength training (biceps, triceps, calf‚Äôs, neck)
Sun - rest

I‚Äôve got myself into such a routine I can knock up a healthy meal, eat and clean up in less than half an hour.

I‚Äôve been through the motions with diets and have tried keto, carnivore and other particular diets, but now I‚Äôm very balanced I hit the following macros:-
Protein 200g
Carbs 150g
Fat 80g
Something along them lines it ends up being about 2100 calories a day, this has resulted in about 8kg lost in two months, I‚Äôm very pleased with that!

I put the success down to the fact I finally made myself responsible for my own diet, rather than expecting my wife to keep up with my requirements (which hasn‚Äôt gone down well in the past).

I went round a neighbours for dinner last night and had a few beers, some lovely food and a bit of dessert all guilt free because of how well I‚Äôm doing and how confident I am of getting back on the wagon the next day!

Anyways, this is all great, but I need to make the menu a bit more exciting and varied without making it harder and less likely for me to stick to my good ways!!

That and cheese. I love it a lot. I also live right across the road from a supermarket so it's way too easy to get the foods I want when I'm craving them. I have ADHD so impulse control is not something I'm good at. I just want to feel more like myself. It's just so hard when I feel like the cheese, butter and pasta are calling my name lol.

these are the things I'd eat when I was on kinda track:
Breakfast:
- Greek yoghurt bowls with muslei, and fruit on top with a spoonful of a nut butter and a drizzle of honey/ maple syrup
- Tomatoes on toast with salt and pepper, margarine on the toast
I'd have a black coffee with these 
Lunch:
- sandwiches with tinned tuna/chicken, lettuce/cabbage, pickles, onion, beetroot, tomatoes, carrot, cheese and a sauce comprised of: siracha, mustard, Greek yoghurt, ginger, garlic, avocado dressing. I'd also make this as a salad if I didn't feel like a sandwich

As someone who thrives on caffeine-fueled mornings, I was excited to put this machine through its paces. The promise of freshly ground beans brewed into a hot pot of coffee sounded like a dream come true. Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve brewed more pots of coffee than I care to admit, all in the name of crafting this thorough review.

**DESIGN & BUILD QUALITY**  
The design of the Cuisinart DGB-550BKP1 is sleek with its brushed metal finish, and it fits well on my counter without taking over the space. It‚Äôs not a compact machine, but for a 12-cup capacity, the size makes sense. The glass carafe feels sturdy, and the ergonomic handle is a thoughtful touch‚Äîno awkward spills here. Buttons on the front make operation straightforward, though the interface might feel a bit old-school for anyone expecting touchscreens. One downside is the grinder chamber, which can feel a bit plasticky. After using it daily, I noticed some minor wear, but overall, the build holds up well.

**BREWING PERFORMANCE**  
This machine grinds whole beans right before brewing, and that‚Äôs where it truly shines. The grinder isn‚Äôt adjustable, so you‚Äôre stuck with a medium grind, but it works well enough for standard drip coffee. The brewing process is reasonably fast, taking around 10 minutes for a full pot. Consistency is key here‚Äîevery pot I brewed had an even strength, which was a relief after years of fiddling with inconsistent coffee makers. However, the grinder is loud. If you‚Äôre hoping to grind beans without waking up the entire house, think again. My kids now associate the grinding noise with breakfast, which is either endearing or annoying, depending on how early it is.

**COFFEE FLAVOR**  
Flavor is where this coffeemaker earns its keep. The combination of freshly ground beans and a slower brewing process (especially with the 1-4 cup feature engaged) delivers a bold, smooth cup. I tested it with a variety of beans‚Äîeverything from light roasts to darker ones‚Äîand the results were consistently delicious. However, if you‚Äôre a fan of ultra-strong coffee, you might need to tweak your water-to-coffee ratio. Adding extra beans won‚Äôt help much since the grinder has a limited capacity.

**CLEANING & MAINTENANCE**  
Cleaning this machine is a bit of a chore, but nothing unmanageable. The grinder and filter basket need daily attention, especially since condensation builds up inside the grinder. I found this to be a minor inconvenience‚Äîjust a quick rinse and a dry cycle before reassembling. Leaving parts to air-dry on my dish rack before putting them back ensures no lingering moisture. It‚Äôs not rocket science, but if you‚Äôre used to a simpler coffee maker, it might feel like extra work.

**PROS**

* Freshly ground coffee right before brewing delivers excellent flavor.
* Programmable features make mornings easier.
* Durable glass carafe with a spill-free pouring spout.
* Brew-pause feature is a game-changer for those of us who can‚Äôt wait.
* Built-in charcoal water filter improves the taste of the coffee.

**CONS**

* Grinder is quite noisy, especially in quiet households.
* Daily cleaning of the grinder and filter is necessary.
* Lack of adjustable grind settings limits customization.
* Grinder chamber feels slightly less durable than the rest of the machine.
* The machine has a dated interface compared to newer models.

**COMPARISON TO COMPETITORS**  
Compared to competitors like the Breville Grind Control and the Capresso CoffeeTeam, the Cuisinart DGB-550BKP1 holds its own. The Breville offers a quieter grind and more customizable settings, but it comes with a significantly higher price tag. The Capresso is slightly less noisy but doesn‚Äôt deliver the same robust flavor. Where the Cuisinart shines is value‚Äîit‚Äôs less expensive than these other options while still providing excellent coffee. However, if you‚Äôre looking for a more modern interface or adjustable grind settings, you might lean toward the Breville, assuming cost isn‚Äôt a concern.

**COST ANALYSIS AND VALUE FOR MONEY**  
This coffeemaker is reasonably priced for what it offers. You‚Äôre getting a two-in-one machine that grinds and brews coffee with minimal effort. While the grinder lacks advanced settings, it‚Äôs enough for the average coffee drinker. The programmable features and built-in water filter add value, making it worth the investment for anyone who enjoys freshly brewed coffee at home. But if you‚Äôre someone who doesn‚Äôt mind grinding beans separately or cleaning less often, you might find more affordable drip machines just as satisfying.

**FEATURES IN ACTION**  
The Cuisinart DGB-550BKP1 has several standout features that I tested extensively. The 24-hour programmability is a lifesaver‚Äîwaking up to the smell of brewing coffee is a luxury I‚Äôd missed. The brew-pause feature is perfect for impatient people like me who can‚Äôt wait for the full pot to finish. The gold-tone reusable filter eliminates the need for paper filters, and the charcoal water filter noticeably improves the taste, especially if you‚Äôre using tap water. The auto shutoff is customizable, too, which is handy for mornings when I forget to turn it off manually.

Overall, this machine is a solid choice for anyone who values convenience and fresh coffee but doesn‚Äôt want to break the bank.

I'm at my wit's end...,"I've had my cat, Mila, for nearly three years and starting about six months ago, she is refusing to urinate in her litter box. This isn't incontinence, she is going in the exact same area, right next to her litter. When this initially began, nothing had changed in her routine or life, which is why all of this is so frustrating.

So, when this all started, I noticed that she was urinating in the corner opposite her litter box, so I pushed the box into that corner, thinking that she - for some reason - wanted to go there. It didn't work, she just went into the other corner, where it was originally, and relieved herself there instead.

There were multiple nights I tried putting down aluminum foil in the corner with a small foil ""bowl"" that held a cotton ball soaked with a scent cats apparently don't like to act as a deterrent, only to find the next morning that it did nothing as she would just piss on the foil. I tried eucalyptus oil, both white and apple cider vinegar, coffee grounds, and a citrus blend - all on different nights, of course.

I finally went and bought her a brand new litter box, a longer one because she is quite the lanky kitty, so I thought that maybe it could help. Spoilers: It didn't. I even tried some of that litter attractant to see if it would possibly ease any wariness she might've had with the new box.

I started testing out different litter brands, trying to see if that was the issue, but nothing I was doing was working.

So, I went to the vet and explained how I was cleaning up urine multiple times a day, every single day, and now my bathroom's linoleum is partially stained yellow and has a permanent odor.

\*\* I should also note that her urine doesn't look off, nor does it have any smell that would raise alarm bells, so I highly doubt it has anything to do with her kidneys not working properly.

Anyways, after speaking to the vet, she said that sometimes cats prefer to use more than one litter box, so I should try buying a second one for her. I did just that and it worked!

...For a few days. Then she just walked in between the two and began pissing there.

I gave the doctor another call, explained that it stopped working, and she said that it was *possible* that Mila had a UTI, but considering the clear, clean urine and lack of any other symptoms - especially over so many months, it was pretty unlikely.

Her advice? Buy another litter box for the middle gap and see what happens.

It works, she doesn't pee on the ground anymore, however, I have a small bathroom and now I can barely open the door. I don't have anywhere else to put them and it is making my only bathroom unusable. It's also kind of embarrassing on some levels when I have guests over because they'll ask for the restroom, only to be able to open it just shy of halfway, having to shimmy their way in.

It also doesn't really solve the issue because last night, I took the middle box out so I could clean it and have space to take a shower, but in the measly 20 minutes that it wasn't there, I stepped out of my shower and straight into a large puddle of piss. It was right in between the two other boxes, and her urine seeped underneath them both.

I'll admit, I am starting to lose my mind a bit. This cannot keep happening but I don't know what else to do. I feel like I have done everything, so am I just destined to not have a fully functioning bathroom?

If anybody else has gone through this and has any other tidbits of advice, I welcome it all. I'll try anything at this point.

Also, to make it clear, I have zero intentions of getting rid of Mila, she's part of my little family and I love her, no matter what üêæüíû

Edit: I also wanted to ask if I should be getting a second opinion to see if maybe there is something medical going on that my (trusted and longtime) vet might've missed.

It looks like the stone sat on top of the burrs and didn‚Äôt get wedged in which is great, because it could have been a lot worse!

The grinder did shave off some of the stone and it does look like it‚Äôs worn away or chipped some of the top of the inside burr.

Local boutique roast to order business which produces great customer service and great coffee. This is my first time buying from them though.

My question to everyone is, who is responsible for any damage to my grinder?

Can someone who has done some or all of the destinations provide a comment about this plan?

We are looking to experience and learn about Colombian culture, explore the nature and we love the sea in general. We prefer smaller towns to big cities. Not at all into drinking or clubbing.

The plan is defined based on where we sleep that night:
* Feb 15 - Bogota
    * My friend will arrive the day before while I will land at 4AM
* Feb 16 - Bogota
* Feb 17 - Palomino
    * 3:20 PM flight to Santa Marta from Bogota, make way to Palomino before EOD
* Feb 18 - Palomino
* Feb 19 - Santa Marta
    * Daytrip to PNN Tayrona
* Feb 20 - Cartagena
    * squeeze daytrip to Minca here if possible
    * bus to Cartagena
* Feb 21 - Cartagena
* Feb 22 - Providencia
    * AM flights: Cartagena to San Andres, San Andres to Providencia
* Feb 23 - Providencia
* Feb 24 - Providencia
* Feb 25 - Medellin
    * Flights: Providencia to San Andres, San Andres to Medellin
* Feb 26 - Medellin
* Feb 27 - Coffee Axis (Salento)
    * Flight: Medellin to Armenia flight
* Feb 28 - Coffee Axis (Salento)
    * Daytrip to Cocora Valley
* March 1 - Bogota
    * 5:30 PM flight from Armenia to Bogota
* March 2 - Bogota
    * My flight departs at 9AM, my friend's at 9PM

This is what I put together after doing some research online. I'm open ears to any suggestions you might have and until we start booking places to stay I can change any part of it. However these are the parts that looked really cool and would hate to miss:
* PNN Tayrona
* Cocora Valley
* Providencia (this part was the most difficult to fit in and I understand if you suggest to get rid of it, however we both thought it would be really cool to have a trip within a trip by taking a 3 day break in the middle of nowhere, just snorkeling and enjoying the beach)

I used flights wherever I though the extra money is reasonable to save us time and make the trip more pleasant

Full context: This trip is my delayed ""bachelor party"" and also a gift to my friend for his 30th birthday. We have known each other since we were 2, traveled together extensively, our favorite trip was 2.5 weeks in Brazil (Rio, Salvador do Bahia, Ilha Grande) back in 2016. We are trying to relive some of that with this trip.

We now live on different continents, I recently got married and I have a kid on the way so it's very realistic that this is our last chance for a trip together. Because of that, I don't mind pushing with the itinerary to make the trip truly epic and something we remember for the years to come.

I'm livid with myself and totally get how fucked this is but I'm mad as hell and need to vent. 

Been with my partner (M35) for 3 years. He has a daughter 9yo that we have 60/40 (40 for us). I'm very involved and for the most part am happy to be as long as he's considerate of my needs in the relationship. Emotional support, love etc it's still a work in progress but generally improving from where it was. 

Context for this exchange: I was up at 6.30am yesterday to take my SD out for her new gymnastics class, took her to a market for a treat and then dropped her off at friends. I then had my friend drop her son (7) off for a sleepover in the arvo while they went to a wedding. I cared for him while partner picked SD up from friends, did dinner and managed their playtime getting along etc, did bedtimes and stayed up until lil man went to sleep. Lil man woke me up at 6am and I went out to let partner sleep because he has a job this morning. 

Around 7.30am I was in the middle of cooking breaky for everyone and I went into our room to ask him to help me with the kids, he was chilling on his phone and didn't come out so I asked him again and he came out. I made him coffee, andcooked breaky for everyone, needed to shit and I told him this. He proceeded to be annoyed with me because he didn't like my ""tone"" when I was managing everthing. I had the mildest of frustrated tones because God forbid I'm a little frustrated after v little sleep and he's just chilling while I'm overstimulated managing the kids.

I asked him why he felt I deserved to be treated crappy for that and didn't deserve some compassion and he said he's ""acting like that because I am"" and I gave him the whole ""real immature"" to do tit for tat speech. I then said ""thanks for being a supportive partner"" and then he said ""you too"" and I lost it, grabbed his eggs and threw them at him. 

I know that's fucked up but wtf?! I just did all this shit for everyone and him and he couldn't even take over for 5 mins so I could take a shit. And then somehow in his fucking head, that's me not being a supportive partner. 

Make that make fucking sense. 

Anyway, I guess I'm wanting to vent, realise this is super toxic behaviour from both of us and ultimately I escalated it the most. But I'm fucking over having someone talk to me and treat me like this just because I'm the slightest bit frustrated in the moment in a way I think was rightfully so because I communicated everything I needed when I needed it and he thinks he has a fair reason to say I haven't been supportive. 

ETA this is the same fucking dude that started talking to me about rings last night. Yeah, THAT ring. How do you go from thinking about THAT ring last night to treating me crappy because I was the TINIEST bit frustrated in the moment with the juggle, not really him and then he spits out the lack of support line.

It's my first job and I am not sure if I am exaggarating things.

First things first, this is my first workplace after graduation excluding my internship. I am an engineering graduate and I had struggled to find a job for long sadly which pushed my carreer behind a lot. So after a long tine of struggle I decided to change courses and apply to whatever I could earn money and got a job at an enginnering factory as a purchasing officer which had no relation to my skills.

The workplace was toxic. People always talked behind others's backs. Boss was a tyrant who exploded over small stuff. He limited us a lot like banning morning coffees. Nagging about breaks like it's not our right. And he had been nagging that our department was lazing because we are a desk job and not being present at the production area. Like, it frustrated me to no end because a desk job is not lazing because you are sitting all day, that's just ignorance tbh. Behind my back other employers also accused me of always sitting in front of my desk, thankfully my manager was a good person and she told them about my skills and the fine job I had done so far. Still an annoying situation for a 2-3 month newbie while I tried my best to adapt to job.

So a week ago, when the company failed to make a big sale, the boss changed my department that I just finally adjusted to after 3 months to sales department, without asking or notifying me. I learnt it over groupchat announcement. And sales department sent me to production department to learn about the products on site for a while like a month, which is I guess natural to some extent but it doesn't give me that much technical info anyway. So now I am spending my days in the production area idly watching workers everyday to hopefully learn stuff, and weirdly I got better at being a mechanic apprentice lol, completely unrelated to whatever I studied or did before in my job here.

Also FYI, I am a big introvert so it's practically a mystery that I can do well in a sales department, I was probably chosen due to my language skill and engineering field of study but communication is essential in sales which I barely got used to in purchasing department. And despite getting ""Promoted"" I had no special salary raise, the boss aligned it with the annual company salary raise and I just couldn't ask due to being the newbie. Basically I am receiving a child's treatment.

Everyone I have spoken to lately has told me that I am wasting my time and talent there and I woud just rust there due to not being in my own field of work. Even using my other skills they told me I could find another job with a better pay.

They keep telling me the boss and managers here like me and they really treat me well personally but that's completely different than just the whole atmosphere of the whole company. I mean IMO of course they would treat me well, I am respectful, I do what I am told without complaining and best of all (for them) my CV is very promising excluding experiences compared to what they paid me.

I want to quit but I am scared of not finding a new job after that because I had a long time job hunting with no result. In the interview, they told me that it might take like 6 months to get used to the job and while I did it in like 2-3 at most, they changed my job making me start from zero. 

Please give me advice. Basically my self confidence was 0, they raised it somewhere and now they're playing with it.

Thanks.

I earn a bit more than her but we've been splitting things 50/50. She has said I should pay a larger share of things but I said no up to this point as I've been saving money to buy a house for us which we've discussed numerous times, and I don't expect her to contribute to the deposit as she earns less, so that's where my extra money goes. When she talked to me to break up, she told me for the first time that she was no longer receiving money from the government for her medical condition and so is much worse off each month and is using a credit card to get by, but I never knew this before. In addition, she has had a shopping addiction which she and her parents have acknowledged. I suggested asking her parents who are quite wealthy but she has said they won't help financially. After she told me this, I said I would stop saving for a house to help her but she said it was too late. She cited this as the main reason for the split. I think this is one of those things couples have to go through to progress. We would have to save similarly for a wedding or kids.

Another reason is that we have almost stopped going out on dates. The background to this (aside from the money struggles) is that she gained weight due to a medication for a mental medical condition 3 years ago and has had low self-esteem since. She has tried to eat healthy and exercise much more recently to combat this which was great for her. The weight gain never bothered me but it's really hurting her confidence so I stopped suggesting going out for food and drinks which were our favourite dates due to this, and the fact that we both had the financial pressures discussed above. I have suggested the last few dates we have done and I can't remember the last one we did that she suggested. I asked her to tell me what dates we can do as I struggle to think of dates we can do without pressuring her financially or to be unhealthy. I know there are things like walks and coffee dates but there is only so many times you can do this.

She also said we have been less intimate recently which is true, but I feel this is 2-sided rather than just on me. The cuddles and kisses have got much less. At times when both working from home, I would come up behind her and give her and kiss and cuddle, and sometimes she would tell me to leave her alone. I understand that sometimes she is trying to concentrate so I started doing this less and the little displays of intimacy never quite recovered. She is having a really rough time at work where she feels she isn't paid enough and isn't valued either, and got some rejections from 2 jobs a day before the break up that she had applied for.

Now she has moved back in with her parents. I feel as though she is super overwhelmed with everything and that she is self-destructing, and I'm the casualty. By moving home, her money issues are resolved and her early-retired parents do almost everything for her. Now we're not talking aside from about splitting possessions and moving out.

I really love her with my whole heart and fear she is making a mistake due to being in a really bad place mentally and I want to talk to her but she feels as though I'm blaming her for our problems which I have said I'm not. I also acknowledge that I need to respect her decision. I thought we were heading for marriage and just a week before the split, she sent me some links to styles of houses we could look at buying, so it's really hit me by surprise and like a truck.

I think this is something we could resolve by improving our communication and I'd pay for the couples therapy if she would hear me out and was willing to try but I can't talk to her to suggest it and I'm concerned that after a week apart, it may be too late. My mum thinks I acted reasonably and like an adult and that there is more my (ex) gf isn't telling me.

Is there any way to save this relationship? Do I try to talk her out of it now or after a few months? Do I just accept and move on? Is there more to this than I know?",2,1738442926.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I started talking with this girl two months ago. She's a JW, and I'm not. We hit it off; our chemistry is undeniable. I asked her out recently, and she said she felt the same way about me‚Äîa sudden, loving connection‚Äîso we've agreed to start dating. However, she insisted that we meet secretly. I don't think I should tell my friends or anyone about this. Although she suggested that we meet in secret, she didn't seem uncomfortable with the idea. I suspect she is underestimating the consequences.

Her mother is a JW, but her father‚Äîcuriously‚Äîis a Catholic who is deeply political. I find it unfair that her parents would judge their daughter for dating a ""worldly"" person, given that their relationship is essentially that. I know the JW organization seeks to control its members' personal lives, and I'm aware of the concept of being ""unequally yoked."" I had invited her out for coffee just days before I asked her out, but she couldn't go because she implied that she was not allowed to leave her home for any reason other than attending university. I found this incredibly concerning.

My parents used to have mixed feelings about the JW faith when I was a child. Although none of them were baptized, we still attended the Kingdom Hall and were taught about ""worldliness"" and the need to deny it. Eventually, they left the Kingdom Hall and have not been baptized, yet they still act like JW (no birthday celebrations, no holidays, etc.). I suspect my parents were disturbed by the realities of the organization, such as being marked for disfellowshipping (DF) and being DF'ed for even minor transgressions, but their cognitive dissonance is so strong that they don't dare call the organization what it is‚Äîa very controlling institution. I grew up with the JW philosophy, but I've never been one myself, so I fully understand what life is like for a JW. For this reason, I get along with and understand this girl so well.

I told my parents about my dilemma with this JW girl I am about to start dating, and they said I was exaggerating the true nature of what I was getting myself into‚Äîand what I might be getting her into, potentially. They said I was exaggerating and making insulting assumptions about the JW faith when I claimed that I could potentially have this girl disfellowshipped or shunned and that she might endure serious social suffering if I do not convert to the faith myself‚Äîand soon. I believe they are the truly blissfully ignorant ones, as I've done my research and am dismayed by this organization's perverse concern with people's private lives as related to one's spiritual journey.

I‚Äôm still struggling with hobby hopping. Since being medicated I‚Äôve hopped from 3 different hobbies - marathon running, golf and now hockey cards now that the golf season is over. 

Question 1:

Since I‚Äôve gotten into hockey cards I‚Äôve blown a ton of money and time just watching hockey card breaks and participating in them, I spend a lot of my time on my phone. It‚Äôs something I want to curb and completely forget about and maybe open a box a few times a year. I‚Äôve unfollowed a lot of them on TikTok and am refraining from watching them on YouTube. I spend most of my mornings before work just laying there watching them and drinking coffee. How do you manage fixations, and when they happen how do you get back to a normal routine? 

Question 2:

Does anyone feel like on medication sometimes you focus extremely hard on your chosen hobby instead of things that are important? How can I curb this and utilize my medication, I‚Äôd almost rather not be medicated so I can forget about it for a few hours and do something else. 

I used to be super into working out and now I don‚Äôt even really care for it - I‚Äôll still exercise a couple times a week through hockey and pickleball but I used to do bodybuilding and enjoyed that a lot. I feel that a lot of the times I‚Äôll fall off track and think it‚Äôs not even worth it to go back because I‚Äôve lost progress or missed a leg day or something. I feel paralyzed sometimes.

1iffw2i,https://i.redd.it/i85mj1rialge1.jpeg,Looking for someone,"Seven Days in Hall 7 - IMTEX 2025 BANGALORE 

The first time I saw her, I was at my booth, lost in the routine of the exhibition. The hall was buzzing with conversations, handshakes, and business cards being exchanged. But amidst all that, my eyes landed on her‚Äîstanding at a booth right across the hall. And in that moment, everything else faded.

She was adorable, effortlessly so. Her presence was like a soft melody in a room full of noise. I wasn‚Äôt good with people, never had been. But exhibition meets had a way of introducing you to new faces, and yet, hers didn‚Äôt feel new. It felt familiar, like a song I had heard before but couldn‚Äôt place. And her eyes‚Ä¶ I fell into them without even realizing it.

For seven days, she was there. And so was I.

I would arrive at 9:45 AM, and she would come in around 10:30, taking her place at the corner of her booth. Exhibitions are exhausting‚Äîstanding for hours, engaging with endless visitors‚Äîbut she never missed a day. That in itself felt special.

On the first day, she caught me looking at her. Our eyes met, just for a few seconds, but it was enough to send a strange, burning sensation through my chest. It hurt, but in the best way possible. I wanted more of it.

For the first three days, it was nothing but stolen glances. I was careful not to stare too much, afraid of making her uncomfortable. But then, there were moments when I looked up and found her already looking at me. And just like that, she‚Äôd shift her gaze away, as if caught in the same invisible pull.

Was I just another face in the crowd to her? Or did she feel it too?

By the fourth day, I couldn‚Äôt help myself. I started walking around, passing by her booth more often than necessary. She noticed. Sometimes, she‚Äôd stand a little closer to the corner, as if waiting for something.

On the fifth day, I decided to test it. I stayed at my booth, barely moving, just to see if she‚Äôd notice my absence. And she did. I caught her looking, scanning the hall, shifting to a spot where she could peep into my booth. My heart raced. Was she looking for me?

Then, she did something unexpected‚Äîshe walked towards her friend, whose booth was right next to mine. They spoke, glancing in my direction. My mind was a battlefield of hope and doubt. Was I imagining things? Was I just another passerby in her world, or did she feel the same pull?

Day six was different. She crossed my booth more often, walking towards her friend, smiling, laughing. I felt like they were talking about me, but I wasn‚Äôt sure. Then, at one point, her friend almost walked up to me, hesitated, turned back, and whispered something to her. She listened, nodded, and then‚Ä¶ walked away.

It was now or never.

The final day arrived, and with it, the realization that this was my last chance. If I didn‚Äôt act now, I never would. I told myself I‚Äôd walk up to her, ask her for coffee, and apologize for being so distant, for not having the courage to speak sooner.

But everything went wrong.

That day, her booth closed early‚Äîby 3 PM. She said her goodbyes, crossed my booth one last time, went to her friend, exchanged a few words, and left. Just like that.

I wanted to follow her. I wanted to say something, anything. But my feet wouldn‚Äôt move.

The last two hours were the hardest. I kept staring at her empty booth, hoping, wishing for her to appear just one more time. I convinced my team to close late, hoping she‚Äôd return. She didn‚Äôt.

Her friend stayed until 6 PM, and at one point, I saw her pointing her camera toward our booth, smiling, as if showing something to someone. Maybe to her. Maybe she was watching. Maybe not.

But the girl‚Äîthe one who had unknowingly become my favorite part of those seven days‚Äîwas gone.

I didn‚Äôt know her name. I didn‚Äôt know where she was from. And I wasn‚Äôt even from this city. I had to leave that night, carrying nothing but memories and unanswered questions.

Would I ever see her again? Probably not.

But if I could have just one more day, one more evening, one more hour‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd walk up to her, smile, and say, ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

I drew whatever I could remember about her. It's been 3 days and I can't recall her face anymore. It hurts.

What is Java Burn?Ôªø  
Java Burn is a powdered supplement designed to be mixed into your coffee. Unlike traditional weight loss pills or shakes, Java Burn is unique because it dissolves seamlessly in your morning coffee without adding any taste. According to the manufacturers, Java Burn is formulated to enhance the fat-burning process by boosting your metabolism and improving your body‚Äôs ability to burn calories more efficiently. The supplement contains natural ingredients known to help in weight loss, all without any harmful stimulants or additives.

Ingredients of Java Burn  
One of the key factors that people consider before using any supplement is its ingredients. What are the ingredients in Java Burn that make it effective? The product is made up of several natural compounds that are known to aid weight loss:

Green Tea Extract: Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract can boost metabolism and increase fat burning.  
Chlorogenic Acid: This compound, found in coffee, reduces the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system, helping to prevent fat buildup.  
L-Theanine: An amino acid that works to improve focus and reduce anxiety, making it an excellent complement to the caffeine in coffee.  
Chromium: This mineral regulates blood sugar levels, helping to curb appetite and reduce cravings.

These ingredients work synergistically to deliver the promised benefits of increased fat burning and improved metabolism. Users have reported significant results, praising the supplement for helping them lose weight without the jitters or crashes often associated with caffeine-heavy products.

We continued to talk and be intimate for 2 months afterwards. We would regularly call, she would come round, we agreed to go for coffee etc‚Ä¶ 
She would tel me she misses me and wanted me to fight for her, and I did. I did everything I could to prove to her I wanted to make things work. The last time we were intimate we agreed to go for coffee/food (I assumed kind of like a friendly date). 

Then she went silent out of nowhere, and within the same week of us last being intimate I find out through a friend that she‚Äôs started to date someone else. I told her that I knew and that I would be removing her from social media and would not be speaking to her anymore. She then calls me for about an hour and tells me ‚Äúit‚Äôs nothing serious, and I wouldn‚Äôt be posting him for a few months anyway‚Äù. I just say that it‚Äôs not really fair on me or the new guy and it‚Äôs for the best. I then find out that she went to my old workplace to meet him there for a date (all my friends work there, just found this weird lol), had already met his brother, was planning to meet the mother etc‚Ä¶ she told me all of this in the phone call (this all happened in 2 weeks of them dating btw).  As well as telling me how great this new guy is and all of that stuff. 

Fast forward to a month after I found out, I reached out because we had a mutual friends birthday coming up and to see if we could be civil and she just lashed out and started to be harsh to me, and she brought up her new guy again. 

A week after this, she messaged me good luck with uni which I didn‚Äôt reply to. She then messages the day after to say sorry for texting she just wanted to wish me well (I still didn‚Äôt reply) and then the day after that she knocked on my door to give me our old photo album incase I wanted it for ‚Äòmemories‚Äô and also so her new guy doesn‚Äôt see it. She also made sure to tell me that she deleted my number cause I annoyed her by not replying to her. I just brush it off and after a brief conversation I walk her out the door.

1ifft6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1ifft6x/verilux_vt22ww3_review_for_light_therapy/,Verilux VT22WW3 review for light therapy enthusiasts,"I‚Äôve spent a few gloomy weeks testing the Verilux VT22WW3 HappyLight Lucent, and to say it‚Äôs been a game-changer would be an understatement. This compact light therapy lamp is designed to mimic natural sunlight, and as someone who struggles with the long, dark winters, it‚Äôs been a beacon of hope for improving my mood and energy levels. The Verilux VT22WW3 delivers up to 10,000 lux of UV-free LED light, making it safe and effective for daily use.

**Design & Build Quality**

The design is sleek and minimalistic, with a lightweight plastic build that doesn‚Äôt feel cheap but rather pleasantly portable. Measuring 6.6"" x 6.5"" x 8.58"" and weighing just about a pound, the Verilux HappyLight Lucent fits perfectly on my desk, bedside table, or even in my bag for travel. The detachable stand offers some flexibility, though I found the sturdiness of the stand to be somewhat lacking. It can be a bit wobbly on uneven surfaces, which might be a drawback for some.

Check if Verilux VT22WW3 is on sale [on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/product-reviews/verilux-happylight-vt22ww3-review-b079ybgpm5/)

**Ease of Use**

The one-touch operation is as simple as it gets‚Äîpress the button, and the light turns on or off. No complicated setup, no confusing controls. It‚Äôs truly plug-and-play, which I appreciate on groggy mornings when I can barely function without a cup of coffee. The bidirectional stand also allows for vertical or horizontal positioning, making it easy to find the best angle for use.

**Performance & Effectiveness**

I started my mornings with 20 to 30 minutes of light therapy, and the results were noticeable almost immediately. The light is intensely bright but doesn‚Äôt flicker or create glare, which is a big plus for sensitive eyes. It genuinely feels like sitting in a sunlit room, minus the harmful UV rays. Within just a few days, I felt more energized and less sluggish‚Äîa big win, especially during the dreariest winter days.

**Comfort**

The light is bright enough to feel impactful without being harsh. However, some users may find the brightness overwhelming initially. Placing the lamp at a slight angle or behind me helped soften its intensity while still providing the benefits of light therapy. There‚Äôs no heat emission, so it remains comfortable to use for extended periods.

**Battery Life & Charging**

Being corded, the Verilux HappyLight Lucent doesn‚Äôt rely on batteries, which ensures consistent performance. While this is convenient for home or office use, it does limit portability since you‚Äôll need a power outlet. A cordless option would have been a welcome addition for on-the-go therapy.

**Additional Features**

Customization is minimal, which is both a pro and a con. On the one hand, you don‚Äôt need to tinker with settings; on the other, some users might miss having adjustable brightness levels or a built-in timer. The lamp‚Äôs portability is a standout feature, though the detachable stand could use some improvement to make it more stable.

**Safety & Skin Sensitivity**

As someone with sensitive skin, I was relieved to find that the Verilux VT22WW3 is completely UV-free. It‚Äôs safe for daily use and doesn‚Äôt cause any irritation. The LED light is designed to be gentle on both skin and eyes, making it a trustworthy choice for light therapy.

**Pros**

* Compact and lightweight design for easy portability.
* Simple one-touch operation for hassle-free use.
* Bright, UV-free light that effectively boosts mood and energy.
* Good for combating seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and improving sleep.
* Minimal heat emission ensures comfort during use.

**Cons**

* Detachable stand lacks sturdiness and stability.
* No adjustable brightness settings or built-in timer.
* Requires a power outlet, limiting its portability.
* Brightness might feel overwhelming for some users initially.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other light therapy lamps like the Circadian Optics Lumos or the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus, the Verilux VT22WW3 stands out for its simplicity and portability. While the Circadian Optics lamp offers sleek aesthetics and adjustable brightness, it tends to be bulkier. The Carex Day-Light lamp, on the other hand, provides a broader light surface but is less compact and considerably heavier. Where Verilux excels is its straightforward functionality and travel-friendly design, though it falls short in customization options and stand stability.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The Verilux VT22WW3 is reasonably priced for its features and effectiveness. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option on the market, but its consistent performance and trusted brand reputation make it worth the investment.

1iffsyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1iffsyb/my_ex_wont_leave_alone/,My ex won‚Äôt leave alone,"I broke up with her cause I fucked up and was in a very dark place at the time. We continued to talk and be intimate for 2 months afterwards. We would regularly call, she would come round, we agreed to go for coffee etc‚Ä¶ 
She would tel me she misses me and wanted me to fight for her, and I did. I did everything I could to prove to her I wanted to make things work. The last time we were intimate we agreed to go for coffee/food (I assumed kind of like a friendly date). 

Then she went silent out of nowhere, and within the same week of us last being intimate I find out through a friend that she‚Äôs started to date someone else. I told her that I knew and that I would be removing her from social media and would not be speaking to her anymore. She then calls me for about an hour and tells me ‚Äúit‚Äôs nothing serious, and I wouldn‚Äôt be posting him for a few months anyway‚Äù. I just say that it‚Äôs not really fair on me or the new guy and it‚Äôs for the best. I then find out that she went to my old workplace to meet him there for a date (all my friends work there, just found this weird lol), had already met his brother, was planning to meet the mother etc‚Ä¶ she told me all of this in the phone call (this all happened in 2 weeks of them dating btw).  As well as telling me how great this new guy is and all of that stuff. 

Fast forward to a month after I found out, I reached out because we had a mutual friends birthday coming up and to see if we could be civil and she just lashed out and started to be harsh to me, and she brought up her new guy again. 

A week after this, she messaged me good luck with uni which I didn‚Äôt reply to. She then messages the day after to say sorry for texting she just wanted to wish me well (I still didn‚Äôt reply) and then the day after that she knocked on my door to give me our old photo album incase I wanted it for ‚Äòmemories‚Äô and also so her new guy doesn‚Äôt see it. She also made sure to tell me that she deleted my number cause I annoyed her by not replying to her. I just brush it off and after a brief conversation I walk her out the door. 

The week after the unexpected visit, I then find out through friends that she‚Äôs made it Facebook official with the new guy and is posting him on instagram. It‚Äôs been a month and half since we were last intimate. Then her brother tries to add me on Snapchat a day or two after she made it official with the new guy. 

I don‚Äôt know what to expect from this, but just wanted a little rant and I‚Äôm just really confused about the whole process. The girl can move on and date other people if she wants to, but if that‚Äôs the case she doesn‚Äôt need to reach out, come to my house, and do all of the other weird shit. It‚Äôs just so confusing. It also just seems so rushed with this new guy, but she seems happy so props to her I guess?

And to top it all off, she gave me thrush after the last time we had sex. I didn‚Äôt even know guys could get it üòÇ",1,1738442410.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

1iffeah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1iffeah/buying_ozempic_in_tijuana/,Buying Ozempic in Tijuana,"Hey folks, I wanted to share my experience in case anyone else is considering it and their insurance doesn't cover it. 

Contextual information: I'm a 35 yr old guy who lives in Los Angeles, my BMI was 35 when I started (34 now) with arthritis and herniated discs in my spine. I was given a trial of Ozempic (0.25 to 0.50 mg) earlier this month when I went to go see an endocrinologist about a different hormonal issue. That was a little over 3 weeks ago and I've lost 15 pounds since then. I have been exercising for 3 hours a day (2 hours walking, 1 hour weightlifting) /6 days a week for the past few months. It's helping me retain muscles and strength while losing weight (I'm hoping fat, a DEXA scan in the next few weeks will tell me). Ozempic, at the lowest .25/mg dose, has been so helpful in helping me keep my calories under 2000 calories a day and keeping away all my sugar/chocolate/sweets cravings. I generally eat about 180 grams of protein a day within an 8 hour time frame (breakfast, protein shakes, and lunch), which Ozempic is really helping by reducing cravings and food noise at night. Previously, my cravings for sugar and chocolate after the sun went down wrecked the progress that I was making and I spent the last 6 months trying my best to not give in to those sugar and chocolate cravings but I was largely unsuccessful until Ozempic. 

I did some digging earlier this week and found that my insurance, [Blue Shield, won't be covering Semaglutide unless I'm at a BMI of 40. ](https://www.blueshieldca.com/content/dam/bsca/en/provider/docs/Weight-Loss-Drug-Exclusion-Fact-Sheet.pdf)I emailed that to the endocrinologist and asked what I could do and if he could help. He replied to me and let me know that whatever I agreed to with my insurance was between me and them and that he was happy I was losing weight and he's happy to prescribe it but that I'd have to take it up with them. 

Which meant that I'd most likely have to $1000 per pen. I didn't like that.

  
Okay then, time to improvise. 

  
So I did some quick research and saw posts on this sub from people buying Ozempic in TJ at places like Farmacia La Mas Barata and Costco. I also reached out to some friends in TJ and they told me that friends and relatives were buying their Ozempic at [Farmacia Guadalajara](https://www.farmaciasguadalajara.com/ozempic-134mg-ml-solucion-inyectable-pluma-precargada-3-ml-1341901#). I also did some research and saw that [Calimax Rio sold it over Uber Eats](https://www.ubereats.com/mx-en/store/calimax-rio/DsXiRwrcVqCmpdtIaeBc5g/90cef09a-37f9-575b-8ac1-af6e99d2ddc7/1061701c-1225-5e3e-b365-bc7989cfd0c6/5e1182d4-53b6-5d8c-b127-fb6b6eade519). 

My plan was to drive down this morning, cross the border, sit in the lobby of the Hotel Pueblo Amigo and had it delivered to me while I reminisced about old times in TJ and if that wasn't successful, proceed to go to a few Farmacias La Mas Barata and then Farmacias Guadalajara until I got two pens.

I only needed the red pens, the light dose, because my only need was for it to keep the food noise down at night; the workouts, the <2000 calories diet, and the high protein intake would do the rest. 

It kind of went to plan. 

I drove down at 4:30am and crossed over at 6:45am, I walked over to the Pueblo Amigo, and put in an order for 2 red pens on Uber Eatsand then went to use the bathroom. The guy who delivered it explained to me that they could only give him one because the other was too high up and they couldn't get stairs (so instead of paying $6705 MXP/$324 USD I ended up paying $3352 MXP / $162 USD + a handsome tip for the guy) . So I took an uber down the street to [Farmacia La Mas Barata](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d5fhKB46N46nKxay7), and bought a second pen for $5805 MXP / $280 USD, more than what I'd like but I didn't want to go [Farmacia Guadalajara](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6fDuTxYKpnFk5bgPA) over by Grand Hotel / Hyatt Place if I didn't have to. 

I then took an uber back to the border, I flashed my SENTRI card at the CBP guy at the fence/foot border and went into the buidling and stood in SENTRI line. 

The interaction with the CBP agent went better than expected: 

CBP: ""Where are you headed?""   
Me: ""Los Angeles, sir""   
CBP: ""Is that where you live?""   
Me: ""Yes, sir""   
CBP: What were you doing in Mexico?""   
Me: ""Buying medication, sir"" \* I hand him both boxes of Ozempic pens  
CBP: He did a quick scan of both boxes ""Okay, thanks"" 

He handed me back both boxes and I was on my way back to my car. 

I took both pens out, put them in an insulated tall coffee mug. I stopped at a McDonalds on the way back up, got a small coffee without sugar, and a mcgriddle (it's my cheat meal day, don't kill me). I quickly drank the coffee, took the pens out, put the remaining ice from the coffee in my coffee mug, put the sandwich wrapper on top of the ice, as well as the napkins they gave me, and some sticks of gum, then put the pens back in - vial side up, put the lid back on and was on my way back to my house in LA. Both pens are currently in my fridge.

Total time from LA to TJ and back was a little over 6 hours, leaving so early in the day, sitting in the hotel while someone else did my shopping, and having a SENTRI card was critical. I'll be asking my endocrinologist for a Letter of Medical Necessity written to a customs official when I see him in a few weeks to protect myself from any escalated questions/issues by CBP next time. 

I hope this helps anyone who's also seeing success but is overwhelmed by the costs and is considering buying Ozempic in Tijuana.  ",3,1738441331.0,Ozempic,1,1.0,False

Temp 96.9.

Physical Exam 
¬†
General appearance - alert, well appearing, and in no acute distress
Mental status - alert, oriented to person, place, and time

Assessment and Plan:
¬†
Diagnoses and all orders for this visit:
¬†
Abnormal CBC
¬†
Recheck CBC in 3-4 weeks-     CBC With Auto Differential; Future
Persistent cough
-     X-ray Chest PA/AP and Lateral
¬†
Palpable lymph node
-     Ultrasound soft tissue head and neck; Future
¬†
Cervical lymphadenopathy
¬†
Malaise
¬†
Recent blood test reviewed with patient.  COVID, flu, RSV negative by PCR.  Thyroid results normal.
Patient was very much concerned regarding CBC results.  White blood cell count is in normal range.  Automated fraction of monocytes appear to be elevated with other fractions in normal range.  Hemoglobin and platelets normal.
Discussed with patient that this could all be due to current recent infection which is presumed to be viral and most likely consistent with recovery state.  Today he reports that his symptoms have improved.  He does not have any risk factors for immunosuppression, immunosuppressive conditions etc.
¬†
-Discussed rest, adequate hydration, monitor symptoms as currently improving.
-Discussed that we should recheck CBC in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure it has normalized.
-Examination was unremarkable today.
-Patient was concerned regarding elevations in his baseline heart rate from normal levels.  Most likely secondary to stress and recovery from infection which is contributing.  No warning signs noted.  Encouraged good hydration, cut back on caffeine.  Monitor.
-Small tender lymph nodes were palpable along the anterior neck bilaterally.  They were tender to touch and most likely consistent with his current inflammatory/infectious state.  Discussed with patient that usually lymph node enlargement will take several weeks to resolve up to 6 weeks.  We should recheck resolution of the lymph nodes and if it is persisting recommended getting an ultrasound of neck.  Patient reports that he would prefer to get an ultrasound today instead of waiting 4 weeks.
-Persistent  mild cough, nonproductive since last year.  Clear lung fields on exam.  Most likely secondary to postviral cough in the setting of bronchitis, upper airway cough syndrome.  Lifelong non-smoker, no chronic lung issues.  Asthma as a child but no active symptoms as an adult.
Due to longer duration of symptoms we will get chest x-ray.

Thank you all so much in advance. I am truly a worried mess. I have convinced myself that I have lymphoma or something else really bad. However, 1 DO and 2 MDs have basically told me to relax and wait it out. I have a hard time believing them, as this mystery illness has gone on 17 days and counting with a light intermittent cough going back to September, I‚Äôve never experienced anything like this.

They were taken from me, right before my eyes. Ripped away like skin off my back. They‚Äôre dead. My wife and daughter are dead, and the police think its my fault. Like I would ever do something so horrible. I *loved* them. With all of my heart I loved my family. How dare those idiots at the police station accuse me of such a horrible

I thought I heard a noise just now, as I‚Äôm typing this out. Like someone was just outside my shitty little motel room, looking for me. He‚Äôs still out there. The man that killed my family. The man that framed me. I think he‚Äôs saving me for last. He‚Äôs close. I can feel it. He took everything from me, but no one will believe me. You‚Äôll believe me, won‚Äôt you? I‚Äôll tell you what happened. I just need someone to believe me.

Before it happened, we weren‚Äôt doing great. You know those usual familial fights? How the house can feel tense, when disagreements happen? Well, the latest one was about a school field trip. She wanted sixty dollars to go to some museum or something. But money was tight. I‚Äôd been killing myself on overtime for over a year now just to keep us afloat, but we were drowning anyways. Bills, groceries, clothes, insurance, car payments, the mortgage. God, it was just all too much.

Well anyways, I told her we can‚Äôt afford to send her but my wife insisted we could spare sixty bucks, so I had to be the bad guy. I told her we couldn‚Äôt and that was final. After that, I was getting the cold shoulder from both of them. So, when I came home that evening after another twelve-hour shift, I wasn‚Äôt surprised to receive another sad excuse for a ‚Äòwelcome home‚Äô.

My daughter sat in the living room, doing homework on our coffee table. She had folders and papers strewn about. Her backpack sat open on my chair. She didn‚Äôt acknowledge me when I walked in. My wife noticed me at least. From past our living room, in the kitchen, she gave me a lukewarm ‚Äúhello, how was work?‚Äù.

I walked past my daughter and kissed my wife in the kitchen. I felt disappointed. She kissed me dispassionately. ¬†Like she didn‚Äôt even want to kiss me in the first place.

‚ÄúLong‚Äù I replied, taking off my steel toes, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs dinner coming?‚Äù

‚ÄúIts going alright. I‚Äôm working with what I have. Did you go to the store on your way home?‚Äù

That was her first little jab of the night. Lately she loved to needle me. She would tell me about her discontentment in passing. Discontentment about not having all the foods she wants, or about how small the new house was, or about how we haven‚Äôt had a date in over a year. I knew it. I knew she felt neglected and discontent. Just another thing going wrong that I wasn‚Äôt fixing fast enough for her. ¬†

‚ÄúNo dear, I was too tired to go to the grocery.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell then, its soup again tonight. I don‚Äôt have ingredients to make much else.‚Äù

There was so much more behind those words. More than I could put on a page. She knew I hated the soup we got from the food pantry. She knew I hated to go to the food pantry at all. She was saying that I failed. I failed to provide my family with dinner and now we have to rely on strangers for help. And because I failed to provide, I should be punished with food I hated.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I was at work all day.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt have a car to take to the grocery. You have the only car. So, you have to be the one to go to the store. I don‚Äôt want to make soup again, *honey*.‚Äù

That honey stung. It was a sweet shot filled with poison. Another jab. Anger swelled in me. I already knew that I was the one that had to go to the store. That I had our only car. That I fucked it up. But she just had to twist that knife a little deeper. Even after all that I provide for them. She still had the nerve to be ungrateful. To tell me I‚Äôm not doing enough.

I was about to tell her off. Tell her that she needs to have some patience and that I‚Äôm her husband and I deserve respect. But my thoughts were interrupted by a loud banging sound outside. My wife and daughter stopped and stared at the backdoor with wide fearful eyes. They were deer in headlights, waiting for a car to crash through our house. When nothing came, they slowly went back to how they were. She continued to stir her soup, my daughter went back to her homework, and I just sat at the dining room table. I took a breath and tried to calm down. I was too exhausted to have another fight.

Wordlessly, I went to go sit in the living room. My daughter still didn‚Äôt greet me. She wouldn‚Äôt acknowledge me at all. But she knew I was there. I could tell. She was tense. Nervous. She acted like a bomb just sat right beside her.

‚ÄúHey, kiddo!‚Äù

‚ÄúHi, dad‚Äù, she said quietly. As if anything louder might make me explode.

‚ÄúWhatcha working on?‚Äù I asked with as much enthusiasm I could muster, hoping she would match it.

‚ÄúSchool work‚Äù she replied, dryly.

She was a whole other issue. She had gone quiet a while back. Disconnected herself. Gone were the days of ‚ÄòDaddy‚Äôs little girl‚Äô. Now she was a stranger, who was afraid of me. I guess that‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôre the ‚Äòbad guy‚Äô too many times.

‚ÄúCan you give me more than a couple words, sweetheart? I missed you at work today, and I‚Äôd love to talk to you‚Äù

She was frozen. Afraid to look up. Afraid to look at me.

‚ÄúKiddo, I‚Äôm your dad. I just want to talk to you. I want to hear about school. Or your hobbies. Or your friends.¬† Just, anything. Please?‚Äù

She was fighting back tears.

‚ÄúMay I go to my room?‚Äù she squeaked out in a near whisper.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked, dropping my enthusiasm. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you just talk to your old man? I‚Äôm your dad!‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs had a long day and has a lot of homework. Just let her go to her room‚Äù my wife interrupted. ¬†

‚ÄúOh, so you get to know about her day, but I don't?¬† I‚Äôm not asking for much! I just want to talk to my daughter. Why won‚Äôt you talk to me!‚Äù

Another noise shook the house, much louder than the first. My daughter began to cry. My wife let out a yelp. I started to swear to myself as I went outside to figure out what all the noise was about.

¬†

When I came outside I found a man, standing by our trash bins. Garbage covered the driveway, apparently thrown around by the man. He was dressed like a factory worker. He wore a Carhartt shirt, jeans, and steel toe boots. The outfit looked like it could have been one of mine. He stood facing away from me. His hands were bloodied and swollen, like he just got through punching something.

‚ÄúIts not right you know.‚Äù, he said to me, still facing away.

‚ÄúWho the hell are you? Get the hell off my property.‚Äù

He ignored me.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not right, the way they treat you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a hard-working man. You‚Äôre an honest man. You work your ass off to give them a place to sleep. You buy them food to eat. And they don‚Äôt even care. They aren‚Äôt even grateful. So, what the hell are you even doing this for?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I love them.‚Äù I answered.

‚ÄúBut do they love you? Do they even like you? Do they even know you anymore? They don‚Äôt treat you like a husband or a father. They use you. They take everything you give them without a second thought and then stick their hands out and ask for more. And what do you get in return? Passive aggression and one-word answers. You give away all of your love and you get none in return.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true. Fuck you man. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. They love me. We‚Äôre just in a rough spot right now, that‚Äôs all‚Äù, I told him. My heart was beating out of my chest, threatening to burst with anger at the nerve of the stranger. ¬†But somewhere, deep down, I felt he was right. I did feel used. Unappreciated. Empty.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying to yourself. You‚Äôre letting yourself be deceived by them. She doesn‚Äôt love you anymore. She thinks you‚Äôre weak. Worthless. She asks for too much. How much are you expected to give her? You‚Äôve given all you have and it isn‚Äôt enough. You‚Äôre not enough for her. Hers, is a special kind of cruelty. Does it make your blood boil, that that parasite leeches off of you without a care for her host?

‚ÄúAnd your daughter. How endlessly frustrating. How much effort does it take? How much can you try, when she won‚Äôt even look at you. She‚Äôs scared of you, and for what? Trying to be a loving father? Trying to talk to his daughter? How many times do you have to roll that boulder up the hill before you realize that she doesn‚Äôt love you either. They hate you. They‚Äôre killing you. They pile the world onto your shoulders and hate that you fall under the weight.

They deserve to know how much you hurt.‚Äù

He turned to me and I saw his face.¬† He looked like a tired man, stretched too thin. Dark circles hung under his eyes. His hair was oily and unwashed. His mouth was dry with cracked lips. Every feature on his face was twisted in disgust. Hatred. Rage. His breathing was heavy. His hands shook with adrenaline. His eyes locked onto mine and I realized two things. He looked exactly like me and he was holding one of our kitchen knives.



I became stuck, completely unable to move. My doppelganger seemed to know this. He paid me no mind as he walked past me. I tried to run. I tried to move at all. But nothing happened. I was a passenger in my own body, with no control. He turned me, so I was facing my house. I was forced to stand there and watch it all unfold through the windows.

I saw him stomp up to my door and let himself inside, slamming the door back shut. I heard the man rampage through my house. He slammed the soup off the stove, letting the giant pot clatter loudly into the wall. My wife screamed my name. I struggled for control again, but I had none. I heard my own voice scream out in anger before my wife was stabbed. The sound of steel on bone pierced my ears. I saw her eyes. She gurgled in pain as her lungs filled with blood. I heard her ribs snap. All the while a voice like mine screamed incomprehensibly in a rage about love and patience and kindness.

I heard my daughter crying. I knew she was as frozen as I was. Powerless to stop what came next.

‚ÄúWHY WON‚ÄôT YOU JUST TALK TO ME?‚Äù my voice came from inside my house, muffled through the walls.

She suffered the same fate as her mother.

I was still frozen as the backdoor opened. He walked leisurely over to me. Blood spattered his shirt, it wicked wildly, rolling off the hydrophobic fabric and dripped onto the pavement. His arms were buried in raised scratch marks, defensive wounds from my wife fighting back. His steel toe boots were drenched in gore. It‚Äôs just too much. I can't remember anymore.

With a sardonic smile he got up close. I was powerless to stop him as he scratched my arms and rubbed my families blood onto my hands. He put his clothes on me, and mine on him. They were soaking wet and I began to shiver. He put the knife in my paralyzed hand, before stepping back and admiring his handy work. Satisfied, ¬†he flashed me a quick red smile, and then he was gone. When I regained control, I got in my car and ran away. 

He took them from me and I can‚Äôt do anything about it. If the police find me, its over. I‚Äôm done. They think I did that to them. I didn't. I couldn‚Äôt. Everyone has bad thoughts sometimes, but that‚Äôs not evidence. That‚Äôs not real. I‚Äôm not capable of that. But those fucking idiots won‚Äôt listen to me. It's not fair. I don't deserve this. I'm a good husband. I'm a good father. If I could just

* Local hiking spots
* Photography meetups
* Book discussions
* Board game nights

I always told myself that my skin-picking was stress induced. Last week, whilst laying down on a hammock, I started poking at my skin once again. It was then I realized, I must be stopped. This self-destructive part of me should not exist. I have finally come up with a strategy to stop it. 

THE PLAN

For the next 30 days, I will stop interfering with all the skin on the left side of my body. This includes left hand, left side of my face - basically everything on my left half. I will minimize any interference with my right side but if I do it subconsciously, I will not take action. However, if I do it for the left, I will take note of the incident in the comments. I will be fully transparent and fully intend to not rush this journey.  
  
After 30 days, I will stop interference with my face for some weeks. Then one-by-one I will stop this harmful habit with all other right-sided parts of my body.    

WHAT ELSE? 

* lukewarm/cold showers that do not exceed 10 mins
* Whilst curing my left half, I will conjure a reward based system. Essentially, if I feel myself manually stopping a scratch attack, I will ice that location with ice cubes for a couple minutes. This rewards good behaviour
* try to reduce my sugar intake. specifically planning to double the sugar in my daily coffee and then manipulating the ensuing guilt to brainwash myself to not consume added sugars from any other sources on the same day
* 6 hours of sleep
* Will start gym. Going to do a Push-Pull-Shoulder-Legs split. 4 times a week only. Shall take showers immediately after this.

1iff5mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1iff5mq/dice_tower_top_100_alternative_weighting/,Dice Tower Top 100 - Alternative Weighting,"Hey all!

Hope I'm not stepping on any toes here, but I tried to do a different weighting on the top 100 games from Dice Tower that takes into account both the position of a game on the list and the number of lists it is on. Purely for entertainment purposes, but I didn't want to hijack the other thread.

Essentially it assigns a ""1"" value to all games and divides that by its position on the list and then adds all of each games values together. It then takes that value and multiplies it by the number of times its referenced (number of lists it's on) and is then ordered by that final value. 

That gives the following weighted values. No better or worse than other list weightings given, but interesting to see how it changes the order!

Obviously from there people can argue about whether a game that is on the list 4 times should be higher than a game that is highly ranked on only 2 lists, like Ark Nova, but that's all the fun right?

1iff5e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPAP/comments/1iff5e5/i_hate_this_need_to_vent/,I Hate This & Need to Vent,"Once I figured out I had sleep apnea it took a year to get diagnosed while I felt like I was literally dying (you understand). First at home test was negative. In lab test was negative. I cry in desperation at the doctors while this man just stares at me and tells me to go to the psychiatrist. At home watch pat reveals mild sleep apnea with RDI of 22. Finally diagnosed. 

Then I got a CPAP used for $500 (ResMed AirSense 11) & while attempting to get used to therapy it died. 

Got a new CPAP, $750. Understood quickly that I was getting aerophagia. Gave up for some months. Mandibular advancement device hurts and does nothing for the nasopharyngeal part of the collapse. Tongue retainer only helps part of the collapse yet I wear it daily. Something must be better than nothing. Cervical collar every day, idk if it helps or not. Sleep on a pillow ramp as well. 

Started having weird heart pains and migraines different from the usual. Diagnosed with asymmetric septal hypertrophy and left ventricular relaxation disorder AND intervranial hypertension at the age of 34 directly caused by untreated sleep apnea. 

I try the machine again. Air shoots out my mouth. Chin strap useless. Mouth tape useless bc my mouth blowing up like a balloon wakes me up anyway. Aerophagia due to congenital weak lower esophageal sphincter is ruining this. I burp all night waking up with each burp every 30 seconds or so. 

I give up again. I start planning for double jaw surgery and maybe mandibular expansion. Feel overwhelmed. 

Chest pains and migraines plague me. I start getting freaked out about my health. I read that BIPAP can be better for aerophagia. I buy one of those fuckers for $1000. 


Get the bipap, try the nasal mask, full face mask, hybrid mask. Can only tolerate nasal mask but still have the air shooting out mouth and aerophagia problem. I also still wear the tongue retainer to maybe lessen the pressure I need. Put mouth tape all around taping the tongue retainer in place and yet still air leaks waking me up. But a hole in a headband, put the tongue retainer through the hole, headband around head to squish my face so that air doesn't flood around my teeth and out the sides around the tongue retainer in spite of the mouth tape. Put on the cervical collar, build the pillow ramp, wear the eye mask, the ear plugs, turn on the white noise. I do this every night. It only kind of works. 

I start at minimum pressure which has absolutely zero effect on my events. I go up .2 each night, keeping iPap and epap 1.2 gap to hopefully minimize aerophagia. Got through nights of literally constant burping. Maybe waking up due to burps is better than waking up struggling to breathe? Except I cannot fully treat my apnea. 

I titrate up to 9.2 ipap, 8 epap. Still having inspiration events & several awakenings each night & im just accepting the aerophagia at this point. I go to 9.4 ipap and leave epap at 8. I wake up after 6 hours of fitful sleep feeling horrible like sleep apnea death again, AND with the worst stomach pain ever. Instead of burping the air just became trapped over time and the gas pains are so bad I cry. I do yoga. I walk around the house clutching my sides. I wonder if I was Ghengis Khan in a past life to deserve this fucking shit. 

What kind of sick joke is it that I will slowly die a terrifying death of my various organs shutting down on me or a heart attack or stroke at 35 unless I use this fucking machine and yet I cannot use this fucking machine.

I guess I'll try again tonight. I'll go back to 9.2 and 8 to get a medium horrible night of sleep to maybe make up for last nights mega horrible one. Then tomorrow I'll try 9.4 and 8.2. I'll analyze the data only to see it's still not really treating my sleep apnea. I'll drink 2 coffees and 3 green teas and I'll run out of the minimal energy that gives me by 12:30pm. By 6 pm I'll feel like a melted puddle, and struggle to complete any work. And I'll do it all again and again and again and worry about my health and the long term life shortening implications of this shit I cannot control. 

Maybe I actually need an ASV. But what if it's just as ineffective and I've wasted another chunk of money on nothing. 

I'm doing consultations for jaw surgery and expansion. One Dr said I probably need expansion which would take a year. I feel like I'm going to stroke out and die before then. 

I cry a lot. I procrastinate going to bed bc I fucking hate this so much. My career ambitions are on hold which sucks bc that's why I'm traveling in the first place. I can barely do anything except the bare minimum to keep myself alive. 

I'm a US citizen but traveling now and uninsured in the US so will have to pay out of pocket someone in Europe to do this surgery. I resent that I will have to spend literally all of the money I've ever saved for retirement on this surgery so that I don't die. 

I guess I could give up on my dreams and go back to the US but the cost of restarting life there with apartment, car, insurance and health insurance, all together plus wait time and fucking around with the medical system to get approval, plus only having the option of subpar surgeons in my state, would be as expensive as just paying for the surgery outright in Europe. 

I'm starting to religiously do posture and oral exercises and I'll keep doing all this bullshit I'm already doing. I'm also losing weight. Maybe combined I can lessen the severity of the apnea which would lessen the health effects. 

Anyway. I just needed to get this off my chest. I wanted CPAP to be my answer, to work for me. I tried so hard and yet I am ""noncompliant"". I'm devastated and closer to death every night. ",4,1738440678.0,CPAP,4,1.0,False
