This turned into a lesson for me, from him, on the economy of coffee expenses and how his cheap concentrate was a much better choice. My facial expression must have then stimulated another lesson on how gift giving without expectations is true gifting, and thus I wasn't 'gifting' it because I was hoping for appreciation in return for my gift. 

Moving forward past 5 minutes of ""lessons"", and me trying to explain I only hoped for a ""thank you""... which amplified the 'lesson' on how I was ""being manipulative with my 'gift'"", resulting in my tearing up because I'm hurt at this point. I genuinely had only wanted to show I loved him and remembered his appreciation for this coffee a couple weeks before, which he did remember, btw. 

Realizing I'm becoming emotional I politely leave the room and the lesson on proper gifting - only to be followed. More emotions from me, because I'm being followed and need to cool down. 

Now, not only is my 1. Expensive coffee choice, 2. improper gifting technique, 3. my manipulation of him all being targeted, but 4. my emotions are now targeted. This resulted in anger, asking him to leave me be for a bit to cool down, which he refused until I raised my voice and told him to ""leave me the fuck alone"". This after nearly 15 minutes of asking ""please, let me cool down, please leave me be for a bit, I'm going to go over here to calm down... etc""

He then called me ""psychotic"". 

I had to get in my car and go for a drive. 

We were married 7 years, this happened 18 months ago. Divorce was finalized a week ago. I think this event was the nail in the coffin, as it shattered my emotional trust in him completely.

1g7qboj,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1g7qboj/bartending_applications_in_coffee/,Bartending Applications in Coffee,"I come from the bartending world (8 years experience) with a specific moat in operations management and process improvement. I have a desire to open a cafe and bar of my own, so I'm in both getting the experience. I work the cafe in the AMs and at the bar at night.  I enjoy the craft, I really do, and I wish it was more appreciated. Tip culture is quite different, despite both being about the same level of difficulty to really get good at. 

Looking at cafe operations from my bar perspective, I find certain aspects inefficient; like pulling espresso to order. In my bar we pull all the espresso we think we need in the mornings, and use the bottles throughout the day. If we need more we batch more. Dump any excess at night. We simply don't  have the bandwidth to do espresso to order during volume. We are told we have the best espresso martinis in the area. 

My question is is there a distinguishable flavor difference between pulling espresso fresh or pulling it earlier in the day? I've researched but it seems very personally opinionated rather than factual. My taste buds don't  detect any difference.  It just feels like an operational hold-up, and we could serve way more from a bar pour system. Plus, hot drinks would still be hot due to the temp of the milk or water being added. I mean, 30-45 seconds saved per drink is a huge process improvement. Any bar manager would brick their pants if you walked in and told them they could cut 30-45 seconds off every cocktails serve. It means more drinks can be made with less employees and therefor higher margins; margins are hard to come by in the beverage industry. 

I will keep the option of making it fresh for those who just want it that way, but between house syrups, alcoholic options, and signature serves: I don't feel like I'd be cheapening the product at all. If anything I'm making it more accessable by making quality products faster, cheaper, and more ready to drink (I hate waiting for coffee to cool down). But then again, mostly impatient people are really good at ops mgmt and process improvement. Thoughts?",1,1729396580.0,barista,0,1.0,False
1g7qbm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1g7qbm3/finally_over_my_toxic_crush/,Finally over my Toxic Crush,"  

Now this is a loaded topic. My feelings for her are complicated, especially now. I‚Äôve known Donna (23 F) for about 4 years. We met during COVID, at an online zoom party. We were in similar friend groups for a while, and soon her and my sister Reagan (22 F) became best friends. After a while I found that I had become attracted to her. 

     Over the years our friend group would fluctuate, with people coming and going. Donna soon started dating Harvey (25 M), and they broke up just as fast. It was a messy breakup, and the effects of it shattered our big friend group. 

     When this was happening, my dad told me I would need to make a choice. I could side with Harvey, my best friend of many years who was starting to drift away. Or I could side with Donna, who was also a good friend, and that I had a major crush on. My Dad warned me that I needed to make a choice, but that there was a real possibility I could lose them both if not careful.

     This was a hard choice for me. On the one hand, Harvey had been my best friend for years. We hung out all the time, and I didn‚Äôt want to lose that. But around that time he wasn't doing so well. He had just started running in some bad crowds and he had started to distance himself from me. I continued to reach out to him, but it never seemed to help. He knew I had a crush on Donna, and when things got rough with her he started to ghost me. I had told him I wasn‚Äôt going to let a girl ruin our friendship, and I wouldn‚Äôt do anything to undermine things with him and Donna. But despite that, our friendship was damaged.   (Future me here, I found out later on that Harvey had felt like he outgrew our friendship.)

     On the other hand, Donna and I seemed to have a great relationship. She was one of my best friends, and I enjoyed the time we spent together. We would joke around with each other, and sometimes it seemed she was downright flirting with me. She was always there, whether it was at events, family gatherings, or parties. When things were ending with her and Harvey, it felt like it was just a matter of time before we could potentially have a much deeper relationship. 

      This was one of the toughest decisions I had to make. I didn‚Äôt want to lose either of them, but definitely didn‚Äôt want to lose both of them. Looking back on it all now, there really was no right answer. Although I couldn‚Äôt yet see it, I was in a no win situation. Before I had even decided, I had already lost both of them.

    But I still made my choice. I decided to let Harvey drift away, and I stuck with Donna. For a while it seemed like I made the right decision. Harvey didn‚Äôt seem to care that I was gone, and didn‚Äôt try to salvage our friendship. And it seemed like Donna and I had gotten closer than ever. And soon things changed between us. But not in the way I expected.

     A few months later Donna invited Reagan and I to visit an Amusement Park. On our way back home, the three of us started getting really personal with each other. We started sharing things that we hadn‚Äôt told anyone before. At one point Donna started talking about Harvey. She couldn‚Äôt figure out why me and Harvey weren‚Äôt really friends anymore. She thought it was all her fault. 

     I don‚Äôt know if it was because of the adrenaline from the park, a sugar high or the comfortable atmosphere, but I did the unthinkable. I told her. Although, I didn‚Äôt tell her everything. I told her that I had a crush on her in the past, but that I was trying to get over it. And what was her response? She reached forward, rubbed my shoulder, and said the one thing I had been longing to hear my entire life. 

‚ÄúActually OP, I also have something to tell you. I‚Äôve always loved you too.‚Äù

    Now  CLEARLY this should have been a red flag. Right after she said it, she laughed and said it was just a joke. At the time, I just laughed awkwardly and pretended to be offended. but when I look back on this moment now, it brings large waves of pain. 

     When she said she loved me, time completely froze for me. Had the day I‚Äôd dreamed of finally come to fruition? Finally, after years of doubt and rejection, had I finally found someone who had feelings for me? In that momentary eternity, I felt utter joy and excitement. 

     And then I heard her laugh. That warm, bubbly laugh she had that I so enjoyed hearing over the years. That symbol of joy and pleasure had transformed into an emissary of pain and sadness. (Future me here again. Wow, this part sounds a bit cringe lol. Ooh, an ‚ÄúEmissary of pain and sadness‚Äù)Each breath she took to laugh was a knife that ruthlessly pierced my heart. (A bit dramatic lol) But anyway, I‚Äôm kinda getting lost in the moment. 

     Like I said before, that should have been a red flag for me, and I should have wised up and moved on. But like a true fool in love, I ignored the warning signs. Although, this experience had left me with second thoughts about her. I had begun to doubt my feelings and wonder if we really were compatible. Maybe it would be better to just stay friends. It was a step in the right direction, but I was too late to stop what came next. 
 
     We still hung out for a while after that, until disaster quickly struck. During the summer of 2022, I went to Donna‚Äôs long awaited Pool party. It was going to be one the last times I would see her, before she moved to Arizona. On our way home afterwards, I was thinking about how much I‚Äôd miss her. I had this idea, where I was going to give her a letter when she left telling her how I felt, but how I was ok with just staying friends. But anyways this part isn‚Äôt relevant. 

Later on that evening(around 9), when I was relaxing at home, I got a text from Donna. She was in the mood to talk, and wanted to talk to my sister. I told her Reagan was asleep, and she was kinda bummed. But then she kept going and started opening up about how she was feeling. 

     We were texting for quite a while about our feelings, and it was at that point when I had another ‚Äúbright‚Äù idea. I told her how I really felt about her. I told her that I really liked her, and the qualities I appreciated. And I told her I knew she wanted to just be friends, and that I would eventually be ok with that. I just wanted to be honest with her, and to get those feelings off my chest before she left. 

     For a few long moments, she didn‚Äôt reply. When she finally responded, she told me she was flattered but didn‚Äôt feel the same. I had expected her to feel that way, so it wasn‚Äôt that much of a surprise. We ended up moving our conversation from text to over the phone. 

     She told me several times that she didn‚Äôt feel that way, and how she was actually only attracted to white guys (which was a lie). We also discussed whether we should take a break from seeing each other. I thought it was a good idea, but when I asked her how she felt about it, she said she didn‚Äôt care. 
     
     In fact, she said multiple times that this didn‚Äôt effect her in any way, and that she didn‚Äôt feel anything about it. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really know each other anyway,‚Äù she told me. I don‚Äôt know, maybe she was lying to spare my feelings, or maybe she really didn‚Äôt care. But what she said really hurt me.  The way she said it, sounded like she was saying that she didn‚Äôt really care about me at all, even as a friend. Like I was nothing to her except her best friend‚Äôs brother. 

     Whether that was her intent or not, I‚Äôll never know. As things were rapping up, I only had one request for Donna. I asked her to not tell Reagan about what had happened. She had been worrying about their friendship ending when Donna moved away. I didn‚Äôt want this to add to her worries. Donna paused for a few moments, then agreed. 


     After we hung up and I went to bed, I couldn‚Äôt help feeling a bit happy. Even though Donna didn‚Äôt feel the same way, I had conquered my fears and told a girl how I really felt. I had always been too afraid to ever do anything close to that. And I was happy to finally know whether she liked me or not. Now that she said no, I felt that I could finally let her go and move on with my life. 

Until‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ my sister woke me up by screaming at me.  ‚ÄúYou Idiot!‚Äù she repeated, as she ran downstairs to tell mom about how stupid I was. Clearly Donna had changed her mind and decided to tell Reagan after all. ‚ÄúAwesome‚Äù I thought, I made my way downstairs to defend myself. 

     Reagan, Mom, and I ended up talking for a while. Mom agreed that I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong, and that Reagan was overreacting. I won‚Äôt bore you with all the details of the conversation, but the experience had kinda traumatized me a bit. I felt like I had committed an immoral sin, and that I had shamed myself and my family. 

     Apparently, Donna had told Reagan a slightly different story of what happened. About how I was pressuring her to love me, how uncomfortable she was, and how I wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer. I know I‚Äôm a bit biased in this regard, but I know I wasn‚Äôt trying to force her to love me. And I was okay with it. All I had wanted was to get some closure and to put it all behind me if need be. 

     As I talked with Reagan, she told me some other things I wasn‚Äôt aware of. She told me that before Donna had told her, she had also told Jess what had happened. You know, Harvey‚Äôs sister. If there was ever going to be a chance of Harvey and I becoming good friends again, Donna had just obliterated it. Reagan had also told me how Donna had lied, and that she didn‚Äôt just like White guys. 

     I couldn‚Äôt believe it. It seemed like everything Donna had told me that night was a lie. And that wasn‚Äôt even the end of it. After that day, Donna started hanging around more often! All of a sudden she was at our house for meals, at our meetings, and in our plans. 

     It felt like a stab to the chest every time I saw her, but I doubt she cared. After all, she didn‚Äôt care how I felt, right? It seemed like it, after all she went from saying no contact to being around all the time. 

     And everybody was fine with that. Mom and Dad couldn‚Äôt have cared less about it, and Reagan was never going to change her plans to ease my feelings. 

     That left me to have to deal with my feelings on my own. It seemed Donna wanted to act like nothing had happened, but that didn‚Äôt work for me. 

     I decided that the best thing to do was to completely cut her from my life. I blocked her on Instagram, deleted my connection to our Spotify playlist, stopped going to parties I knew she‚Äôd be at, and did everything I could to remove myself. 

     Eventually she finally moved to Arizona, and I hadn‚Äôt seen or heard anything about her until 6 months ago. Donna eventually moved backed home, and quickly got back together with Harvey. It seemed to work out better for them this time, as they got married 4 months after. 

     Now that they‚Äôre back, I see them at least twice a week now. We are in the same friend circles again, they live nearby, and we even go to the same place of worship. Each time I see them is a constant reminder of what happened. I try to remain polite but distant to Harvey when we‚Äôre forced to interact, but Donna completely refuses to acknowledge me. 

     There‚Äôs still a part of me that hurts over what happens. And I‚Äôm reminded of these feelings whenever I see my friends pairing off, and I‚Äôm still single. It‚Äôs not always easy, but I don‚Äôt think I would change a thing about what happened. 

     Although it was hard, the whole ordeal helped me to grow. I don‚Äôt think I would be the person I am now without it. I feel like I‚Äôve already faced the worst case scenario, and I can be prepared for the next potential relationship. 

     There is a part of me that wonders if I‚Äôll ever reconcile with Donna and be friends again. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know. Right now she thinks I hate her, and we‚Äôve avoided each other like the plague. And that really doesn‚Äôt bother me at all.  

     Maybe Donna and her family think I was only friends with her to shoot my shot. But I know that wasn‚Äôt the case. I was really glad to have her as a friend before this all happened, and I had wanted to stay friends. 

     As I sit here writing this in my local Coffee shop, I can‚Äôt help pondering over the past, and on what my future will be. The potential possibilities seem endless. I know, that someday I‚Äôll find someone who does care for me, and I look forward to that day. But until that day comes, I‚Äôm happy with my choices, and I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing.

1g7q97n,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g7q97n/i_miss_my_toxic_ex_girlfriend/,I miss my toxic ex girlfriend ,"(TW: Soft mentions of SA) I am a 25 year old guy who has only had 2 girlfriends in my life. I met my first girlfriend, let‚Äôs call her Emma, in freshman year of high school. We were friends for most of freshman year but began dating towards the end of the year. We had a fantastic honeymoon phase, but as two highly-emotional teenagers, also had a very toxic relationship and would argue all the time. She would always get upset at me and we would argue for HOURS. The arguments would only end when I would apologize, and in order for her to accept my apology, I had to do something special like write her poems or songs, etc. Because she was my first and only gf, I was so afraid of her breaking up with me. I remember she really wanted to have sex with me, despite me being very fearful of sex (bec of pregnancy and stuff). She would get upset at me because I wasn‚Äôt like ‚Äúother guys‚Äù who would be super happy to have a gf who wanted sex. To please her, I agreed to have sex with, not really wanting it. All in all, she‚Äôs gaslit me, made me apologize to her AND her family whenever I made her cry, physically hurt me once, and would always blame me for arguments we had. Fast forward to senior year of HS and she breaks up with me, without any explanation. I became really depressed, tried to talk to other girls but always felt like it wasn‚Äôt the same without Emma. She would show up to school with hickies and would flirt with other guys in front of me. Eventually we relapsed back to some sort of ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù however I was always still very hurt by her decision to end our relationship. 

 After I graduated HS, I went to university across the country, leaving her in our home state. I would text her and FaceTime her a little from time to time. One night, I went for a walk and finally got the courage to block her number and block her from social media. I never knew if she realized I blocked her or if she ever messaged me again. 

Fast forward, in college I met my now fianc√©e and she‚Äôs the best woman I could have ever asked for. She is smart, beautiful, mature,a good communicator, and many other wonderful adjectives. She allows me to explain my previous relationships, validates my feelings, and is always there to support me. However, to this day I don‚Äôt stop thinking about my abusive ex. I don‚Äôt feel hate towards her, although a part of me thinks I should. Sometimes I still dream of her, dreams of catching up with her over some coffee, however accepting that we are no longer friends, but strangers. I would NEVER get back with my ex and am SO grateful that my ex dumped me because I‚Äôm in a better place in life than when I was in that relationship. I do feel like I wish I received closure from her, as to why she broke up with me, but I don‚Äôt allow these thoughts to keep me from sleeping*.

Emotions matter to me‚Äîempathy, honesty, and genuine dialogue are what I‚Äôm about. I value conversations where both sides feel truly heard.

Music is my life‚Äôs background score‚ÄîI‚Äôm into everything from In Flames, Aether Realm, and Blink-182 to Sum 41, Electric Callboy, Breathe Carolina, and Our Last Night. Recently, I‚Äôve been vibing with a lot of The Anix. For me, lyrics often feel like the captions to my experiences.

I love exploring deep topics about life, different perspectives, and what makes people who they are.

I‚Äôm a night owl and highly inquisitive‚Äîalways eager to learn about new people, cultures, and what makes them unique.

I‚Äôm a fan of sci-fi, horror, and comedy‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs the world of Star Trek, the thrills in Evil, or the humor in Shaun of the Dead, Cooties, and Zombieland. Plus, I‚Äôm into reading about and watching videos on the paranormal.

I have a fascination with psychology and human behavior, always eager to uncover new ideas and challenge common beliefs.

Nature is a place for peace and introspection, even if I don‚Äôt spend as much time outside as I‚Äôd like.

I‚Äôm a Team Pepsi person (though Dr Pepper holds a special spot), love tea, drink coffee rarely, side with Star Trek, have no party affiliations, and will always choose Twizzlers over Red Vines. Now that we‚Äôve covered those bases!

I usually get along best with other INFPs and INFJs.


Age doesn‚Äôt matter to me‚Äîif you‚Äôre a free thinker who doesn‚Äôt follow the crowd (like being willing to eat any kind of breakfast without a second thought), bring the peanut butter, and I‚Äôll bring the bread. Let‚Äôs see if we can create something awesome together!

My ex BF (47M) passed away from an accidental OD and I (35F) and incredibly devastated. I‚Äôve been damn near crying daily since and I have no one to talk to about this. 

We dated in early 2017, but were friends for a year beforehand. He was honestly the sweetest man I had ever met in my life. For a long time during us dating and after I always felt like he was the one for me. We kept in touch after our breakup periodically, but I kept my distance from him. I heard from some mutual friends that he was going through some deep trouble involving drugs and had been acting erratically and pushing people away. 

I had last texted him last week but I sensed from his response to my message seemed short so I didn‚Äôt respond to him. I very much regret that. I even wanted to call and tell him that I was going to be back in town and wanted to grab a coffee or lunch next month. 

The morning of his passing I had a dream of him and this time we accidentally crashed a wedding. It was a mesmerizing moment we had after we left the wedding were we both agreed it was easily the best day of our lives. Literally hours later I got a call saying he was found alone in his apartment. 

Our breakup was amicable, he was an amazing man and I have nothing bad to say about him. I think we both were madly in love but perhaps the timing was off (I was leaving my apt to move away from an ex I had who was violent and I had a restraining order against, he had gotten out of a long term relationship months before we started dating). I‚Äôm so mad we were just not able to be with each other in the way we both wanted. And the idea I‚Äôll never see him again. 

Or that maybe I‚Äôm just delusional to think of all this and am overreacting. I‚Äôd also like to think that my dream  of him the morning he passed was him visiting me to say goodbye? 

I feel like I can‚Äôt talk to anyone about this. I‚Äôve been to church to pray for him. I hope this feeling is normal and that I‚Äôm not crazy.

1g7plqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/bbCafe/comments/1g7plqn/tips_to_create_a_positive_and_consistent_gym_life/,Tips to create a positive and consistent Gym life. ,"Comprehensive tips for starting gym life! The gym can seem like an intimidating or challenging place. As someone who has been a first time gym-goer. I hope this advice is helpful!

**Plan your week.** Incorporate gym time in a way that works for *your* schedule. I recommend trying to carve out 30 minuets to an hour per session. As a beginner, you don't need to be rapped up with how much time you spend at the gym. I highly encourage giving yourself a month to just experiment with your schedule as it will likely change along with the workouts you do. Once you find the routine you like, you will become more efficient and consistent with the time you have. A common misconception is that you need to go to the gym every day or workout for several hours at a time in order to see results. In reality, a couple times a week for 1 hour at most is about all you need, especially for beginners. I currently go to the gym about 3 times a week for 1 hour each session. Based on the exercises I do and my lifestyle, I find this schedule pleasant and progressive. Tips: getting enough sleep and fueling your body should be just as important as incorporating gym time as both of these things can negatively impact your gym life. Ease into it to avoid burnout.

**Shift your mindset.** Make gym time your *FUN* time. Go to a gym *you* feel safe at. Exercise in a way that makes *you* feel good. Wear what *you* feel comfortable in. Experiment with equipment; set up an appointment with a trainer at least once; don't be afraid to ask others for advice. If you're social, be social. If you're anti-social, be anti-social. The gym is for everyone and anyone who makes you feel unsafe or unwelcome should be reported. Tip: Progress is about consistency in the long run so missing a day or week will not hinder you as long as you get back in the next time! I used to have the mindset that I'd ruined my entire month because I'd missed a week or day. This thinking lead to prolonged on and off periods in my fitness journey. To prevent this thinking, I created a ""reset"" day for myself. If I miss a week or day, that's ok because without a doubt, I'd be back in the gym by Monday. This day works for me because I feel well rested after the weekend and feel inspired to start my week strong. This lead to a long-term gym streak that yielded more results and prevented the yo-yo effect.

**Inspiration or getting into the mood can be created.** I've heard people say that you shouldn't wait to feel motivated before going to the gym. There is some truth to this. For example, coffee is what might inspire you to get out of bed, drinking coffee might give you a spurt of energy or dopamine, the sensation of energy or dopamine might get you pumped up about going to the gym. This is just one example of how motivation follows action. So there is some truth to creating a schedule and sticking to it regardless of feeling motivated. But again, the gym should be a *FEEL GOOD* place. If you're always forcing yourself to go to the gym or do workouts you don't enjoy, you will create a negative association with exercise and gym life. It will only get harder and harder to show up. So, rather than forcing yourself to go regardless of motivation, you should find something that *inspires* you to show up. You should find something that *gets* you in the mood. Find what makes you feel excited, frustrated, hopeful, or energized and *use it*. For example, I will put on my workout music *before* my gym time; it gets my heart racing and I begin to imagine the exercises I might do that day. Maybe looking at before and after photos, watching glow up videos, or thinking about family/friends gets you in the mood. Tips: If you find yourself in a very negative headspace, it's ok to leave early. When I'm having a rough day, I will still try my best to show up and get a workout in, but sometimes I'm just feeling awful. I will start with the negative self-talk, get progressively frustrated with exercises that aren't making me feel how I expected them to make me feel, and feel increasingly uncomfortable or out of place at the gym. On days like these, I find it's best to cut my time short and leave with the promise to try again later so that I don't create a negative association with the gym. This helps me to make the gym a reward, and a place of self-care. This method might not work for you. Rather, you might like channeling your negative headspace into a harder workout instead and feel refreshed by the end of it!

**A sense of obligation can help with consistency**. If group classes, working with a trainer, or telling other people about your fitness journey is what makes you feel obligated to show up, then create that atmosphere. For me, weekly journal entries worked the best. I would start my Monday with a journal entry about how I wanted my gym week to go and felt obligated to at least show up so that I could cross dates or tasks off my calendar. If I didn't complete what I'd planned, I would just start fresh with a new week. I found that an *encouraging* and *low* *pressure* sense of obligation helped me with consistency better than a high pressure one.

**Progress and goals can help or hinder.** Goals (can easily be unreasonable and unachievable). Gym-fluences will have you believing that you can achieve your goals in weeks, but fitness goals often require more time and different methods than influencers demonstrate in short videos. So unless you're encouraged by challenges and long term goals, try to set smaller or shorter term goals. For example, the goal to show up, to repeat your last session perfectly, to do a pushup, squat the bar, get closer to touching your toes, balance on one foot for longer, try new equipment, asking that one person or trainer how your form looks. Achievable goals allow for you to feel invigorated when you meet or surpass them, and allows space for you to acknowledge the progress you make. Goals related to loss or gains usually require additional *lifestyle* changes *outside* of the gym so I discourage setting these goals until you've created a positive association with the gym, discovered the exercises you truly enjoy, and have done further scientific based research about how best you can achieve gains or losses. Progress (let it be a side effect rather than an achievement). A sense or feeling of progression and improvement will help you stay consistent, but expecting progress can lead to disheartenment when you don't ""improve"" within a certain timeframe. Avoid putting a time limit on your goal and allow for flexibility. For example, I evaluate my fitness journey every week and re-set my goals based on how last week went or based on new information I've learned.

**Regression**. Rest and recover, sleep, vacations, life events... Regression is natural and you wont 'regress' as fast as you think you will. Missing a day, missing a week, missing 2 weeks. You might not be progressing, but you won't necessarily be regressing at that point. Maybe you miss a month and you do notice that you can't run as far or lift as much. The good news is, your body remembers. It's easier to do it again than it is to start fresh. Some influencers demonstrate how they ""bounce back"" in order to advertise their brand but they aren't usually starting from scratch. Scientifically, their bodies remember the muscle mass they used to have. Behaviorally, the regression period was the abnormal life event while fitness is their usual, habitual, life event. Comprehensively, they've already done that experimentation and understand what exercises work for their bodies. Some influencers choose to lie about how long it took for them to get results but that's another conversation. Many people strategically use regression. Bulking is a form if intentional regression. Many athletes will ""slow down"" for an off season to recover and to focus on technique. In other words, if you regress, embrace it. *Make it intentional*. Focus on technique or recovery. Going lighter in your workout doesn't mean you aren't working out. If you find yourself ""regressing"" often, it's possible you'd benefit from a change in your current routine. Take the time to try something new.

**Weightless or muscle gains**. For now, I'll only say that a gym routine is a complimentary tool for these goals. Rather than getting stared at the gym, these topics require a more all encompassing lifestyle discussion about nutrition, hormones, genetics, fitness, and sleep. If loss or gain goals is what brought you to the gym, that's fine, but I strongly encourage creating a positive association before you start looking at gains and losses.

Everything I've written above is stuff I currently incorporate because I fell for it all. I didn't plan my schedule well, I had the wrong mindset which made the gym an uncomfortable place, I struggled to remain consistent because I wasn't 'in the mood.' Each time I started at the gym I felt either no obligation or high pressure obligation which, after inevitably missing a session, lead to prolonged off periods. I ignored celebrating the progress I had made because I was too focused on the fact that I was not achieving the unreasonable and unachievable goals I had created. I had many moments of feeling defeated before I gained an interest in learning more about overall wellness.

I started listening to professionals and writing down ideas I wanted to incorporate into my life. I decided that weight loss should be a side-effect rather than a goal for me. I experimented and found exercises I enjoyed; that made me *feel* good. I made goals about improving flexibility, breaking a sweat and about elevating my heart rate every session. I started journaling--reflecting--about the progress I was seeing along with the professional advice I wanted to try next. I focused on form and repetitions which naturally lead to visible muscle development and increased flexibility. I discovered that I like the sauna rather than the steam room and talked to a gym trainer despite my gym introversion. Before I knew it, I'd achieved the longest gym streak of my life and learned more about fitness int he past few months than I did in the past years.  As a side effect, I've lost about 10lbs of fat and gained more muscle than I ever imagined I could put on.

Getting in and staying in the gym can lead to great habits and health benefits. You will learn about yourself, maybe find a community, and discover something new! Maybe, like me, you'll begin looking up how to use various equipment, find some really helpful trainers who share free information, and learn about lifestyle wellness outside of the gym along the way.

1g7phre,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g7phre/confused_on_how_i_feel_about_a_girl_need_advice/,Confused on how I feel about a girl. Need advice.,"Hello all, I‚Äôm a 27M needing advice.

So there‚Äôs this for at the gym that approached me a couple weeks ago. I had bad anxiety while taking to her but I kept the conversation going. We hit it off right off the bat I‚Äôd say. Ever since then I‚Äôve been terrified of seeing her or taking to her cause my anxiety would spike bad at the thought of seeing her. The second time I talked to her my anxiety spiked bad. Probably made me seem uninterested in talking to her but little to her knowledge I was having crippling anxiety preventing me from talking to her.

Recently I saw her and I was fine. Conversation flowed for the most part. Couple awkward pauses but more so I think cause I didn‚Äôt know how to continue the conversation I‚Äôd say. She kept it going and I‚Äôd keep the conversation about her cause I‚Äôd get anxious taking about myself. 

I can clearly tell she likes me. She was flirting with me at one point. Little things I pick up on just told me over time and confirmed it. She is cool to talk to and I think I wanna get to know her better but for one, I‚Äôve never been on a date, never hung out to get to know a girl like this before, and feel conflicted on how I feel about her. She‚Äôs a really sweet and cool person to talk to but not sure how I feel or if I want a relationship right now. I go back and fourth with myself about that a lot. 

Part of me wants to ask her out for coffee or something to get to know her but I also question if I really want to or not. I don‚Äôt wanna waste her time. But we do get along pretty well from what I‚Äôve noticed. She‚Äôs ambitious and a  sweet person from what I‚Äôve seen and I find that attractive. I don‚Äôt think I like her like that yet but I do find her personality attractive to me. Like I said I feel like I want to get to know her but I‚Äôm not sure how I feel.

I question if I should like her immediately or does that come with time getting to know someone? I‚Äôm conflicted on how I feel. Maybe someone could help me out?

1g7phkw,https://v.redd.it/34lyi2krutvd1,Machine + grinder upgrade advice please! ($1000-1500 CAD),"I‚Äôm looking to upgrade my home coffee setup and hoping for some advice! Fair warning: this is stupid long for no good reason, I‚Äôm sorry! 

TLDR; seeking recs for new espresso machine and grinder for under $1500CAD, including quick heat up, less/no plastic, easy grind/bean swap, and.. also‚Ä¶ pretty.

Starting Place: 

I‚Äôve had this Saeco/Starbucks machine over 15 years, and it has been a reliable daily driver outputting 2-10 drinks a day, with only a few replacement parts here and there. The drugstore Bodum conical burr grinder was a nice upgrade from my drugstore Braun, and I think it‚Äôs been great for its price point.  

I drink americanos with cream, although I‚Äôm not sure that what I make technically qualifies as espresso. With a slightly coarser than espresso grind, I am able to consistently make myself ok espresso-like beverages, but if I grind on the finest setting, it‚Äôs hard to know whether I‚Äôll end up with a fast but ok coffee and a sloppy mess instead of a puck, or if the machine will struggle to squeeze out a few drips over a several excruciating minutes. So the coarser grind has been key to not being frustrated in the mornings, and I think it‚Äôs time to do my beans justice. Lately the brew temp has been inconsistent, but rather than replace parts again or find another used Saeco on marketplace, I‚Äôm ready for something new. And better :)

Workflow: 

I posted the video so you can see the workflow, which I like and wouldn‚Äôt want to add too many complicated steps to. Read: no Flair recommendations, thanks though. I know I will need to up my game a bit though, and obviously my next machine probably won‚Äôt be ‚Äúself tamping‚Äù, so I will add scale, tamper, spinny spikey thing, and a portafilter tamping holder thing, and knock box to my xmas list. At some point in the future of my next espresso setup, I (hope I) will be doing this with a baby on one arm, so being able to go through the steps safely and with mostly one hand is important.

The Ideal Machine: 

My ideal espresso machine heats up quickly, has a similar/small footprint, and (this is important to me) has minimal plastic. I say this because I think a lot of users may recommend the Bambino, but the way that its tank connects to the machine internals wouldn‚Äôt allow me to sub the plastic tank for a glass container. So the tank will need to suck water through old school tubes and not via the little sucker thing that the newer Breville and similar machines all seem to have. 

If budget wasn't a concern, I think the Ascaso Steel Duo hits every single must have. Or the Lelit Mara X for looks alone, but I don‚Äôt think I can justify the price, plus the 24 min warm up time would end up meaning I‚Äôd leave it on literally all day so I have the option to make myself coffees between WFH meetings. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs ok to leave a machine like this on all day‚Ä¶ but she‚Äôs so pretty, I could see myself making all the exceptions.

Grinder: 

The ideal grinder is single dose so I can have decaf at night, switches settings easily so I can make pour over or French press if I have guests, has limited plastic components, contains its static and mess, and preferably comes in white. 

Right now I‚Äôm thinking one of the Turin grinders fits my criteria and budget, but could use some help deciding which. I prefer full bodied, dark, rich flavour profiles over the trending light/floral/acidics out there. I think conical burr is ok? 

Location:

I‚Äôm in Vancouver and vary my beans between Elysian espresso, Salt Spring (from Costco and always in the freezer just in case), and whatever‚Äôs interesting looking at the cool little roasters on Arbutus, it think it‚Äôs called Sweet Barrel Ice Cream. My decaf is Umbria.

I'm not sure where to shop here, so local shops or online recommendations would be great. Totally open to buying used if maintenance won‚Äôt be too complicated/expensive. Worth mentioning that Espresso Outlet doesn‚Äôt ship to Canada, and Amazon.com is different from Amazon.ca!

I'm a picky eater in the weirdest way. If someone I trust is cooking for me then I will eat everything they make. Unfortunately, when me or my boyfriend cook I feel disgusted. I will actually gag when eating. I'm a great cook (not my boyfriend) and I enjoy cooking. It's just that when it comes time to eat...I just can't do it. 

Another example: when food is in the fridge for longer than a day, I start to feel extremely grossed out by the food. 

Foods that are okay for me: drinks. Boost, juice, coffee, smoothies. Anything in drink form that I can just quickly guzzle down.

I sometimes have to force myself to eat even though I have no appetite. It's not enjoyable at all. Today I had a cold cooked chicken breast in the fridge and I just ate it cold over the sink and took a huge gulp of water with every bite just to get it down as fast as possible.

So a couple of months back, I was renting alone at an apartment for a while because of some major family troubles. I was living there as a student at that time. So, staying there, I was lowkey most of the time, never spoke to neighbours since it was a a foreign place for me and I was renting, so just did my own thing. I do remember there being three neighbours dogs that consistently barked, and to a point it really started to affect my mental health, I was also really hypersensitive to all sounds (including car honks) and I ended up having a major breakdown after picking up something from the stores, all shaking and everything, nearly a seizure, but thankfully one of the dogs disappeared at one point though since I no longer heard them, so there was that ig. I also worked remotely and barely went out for this reason then. But I just remember the neighbours owning dogs who were quite barky, and could hear them even though I was renting on the second floor. I also had a really bad dream the night I had that major breakdown, I was chased with a knife by many bald Africans of varying ages, like a whole mob of them (but they weren‚Äôt people, they were half-spider), but i ended up running away and waking up right after. Also a bit of context, i was also overseas before this and had a paranormal encounter then for the first time, which was very frightening for me (won‚Äôt get into details).¬†

So anyways back at my apartment, the first time something happened, it was just knocks on the dresser next to my bed and then under my bed as I was sleeping. I remember crying that night before going to bed, and I was in a really bad place that time so I think I tried to communicate with it and told it to ‚ÄòEnd me‚Äô and in retrospect it seems very silly of me, but nevertheless, that's what happened- but nothing paranormal ended up happening for a while after that, thankfully.

Probably a few days later, I remember feeling mellow about something during work (it was daytime), so I decided to take a nap then. I heard knocking on my dresser right after, like the other night. And that‚Äôs when things got really weird and crazy- There were knocks on two of my apartment windows that I regularly opened for some fresh air, continuously for maybe like a week straight? something like that idk... It was very weird.

The first thing is I woke up to one of the dogs barking in the middle of the night, near the window where I slept (I read online that dogs barking at night was a bad sign), then hysterical laughter from my window right after. I remember being really afraid but also tired and also mad(?), and told myself I would figure out what to do after I awoke after having a coffee. But I ended up having a pleasant dream before I awoke, then woke up to a foresty fragrance I could smell from the window, yet the knocks continued... I felt calm that morning yet confused, and tried to share this online too... But anyways, from the other window, I also remember another oceany scent amidst the weird knocking and sometimes barking (I also read online that there were good jinns so I thought it could be the case bc of this?). I also heard microwave-like sounds, but of varying frequencies- it was weird.

Anyway, so I told my sister about this bc I had to tell somebody! and also was planning to get a special person to ward off these kinds of things. But it got really insane, the knocking continued to the point that I just moved back home, after mending things to a degree.¬†

Even then, I feel like ever since then, I‚Äôve been so affected by sounds of nature specifically (ie, bird sounds) more and I feel like my mind can go insane sometimes, and I‚Äôm pretty lowkey too so I don‚Äôt use socials much‚Ä¶

Anyway, I feel like I needed to get this off my chest here since my head‚Äôs been going insane lately bc of all this‚Ä¶",1,1729392943.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

I am not a doctor.  Below is what worked for me.  Always partner with your doctor before doing something like this.

**PREMISE**

Everything here is centered around controlling/reducing insulin, and elimination of insulin resistance.¬† Insulin dysfunction is at the center of most ailments nowadays, including obesity, diabetes, heart conditions, Alzheimer‚Äôs and even cancer.¬† The body produces insulin in response to the presence of glucose in the blood, so that‚Äôs the primary mechanism we‚Äôll use below to control insulin.¬† For more information on this search for podcasts/articles by Jason Fung and Robert Lustig.  Their interviews on Diary of a CEO are literally life changing.



This routine has three components: diet, fasting, and exercise. ¬† Hands down fasting is most important, diet second, and exercise third.



**FASTING**

Fasting gives your body a break from processing macronutrients.¬† One the carb side, the reduction in glucose will give you long periods without insulin.¬† Insulin is a storage horomone used to store glucose into fat.¬† Your body cannot burn fat while insulin is high, so fasts allow your body to be able to pull energy from fat.



Additionally, fasting gives you a break from protein ingestion, which forces your body to recycle malformed cells/tissue internally, a process known as autophagy.



There are several types of fasts.¬† Many people refer to ‚Äúintermittent fasting‚Äù with notation as 16:8, 18:6, 20:4.¬† The first number is how long you go without food, the second is your eating window.¬† Some people refer to these schemes as ‚Äútime restricted eating‚Äù and will reserve the term ‚Äúfasting‚Äù for extended fasts of 24 hours or more.



There‚Äôs also OMAD (one meal a day) which is basically a 23:1 fast.¬† And there‚Äôs ADF where you fast completely every other day, which looks a lot like 36:12.¬† And you can do one-off 24, 36, 48, or 72 hour fasts.



On a fast, you can consume water, carbonated water, black coffee, or green tea.¬† And that‚Äôs it.¬† For fasts longer than 24 hours you may feel cramping, heart palpitations, headaches, or faint.¬† This is a sign of low electrolytes.¬† You need to consume electrolytes during a long fast (every 12-18 hours).¬† I use LMNT brand.


You will feel hungry during these fasts, but hunger isn't pain.  You can often eliminate hunger by going for a walk, having some electrolytes, or having some carbonated water.  Or just wait a few hours and it'll fade.  


**My Scheme:** I did a modified ADF, fasting for 36 hours, 2-3 times a week.¬† Usually Friday, Sunday, and Wednesday, but sometimes that varied.¬† On non fasting days, I ate during a 12:12 window, usually from 7:30a to 7:30p.



I had to build up to this.¬† I started by doing a 16 hour fast just on Sundays, and 12:12 every other day.¬† Every Sunday, I added an hour to the fast until I was at a full 24 hours.¬† After 4 weeks of that, I jumped to my first 36 hour fast.¬† It was super hard.¬† The following week I did it again, and it was less hard, and continued to get easier.¬† After a couple months of a weekly 36 hour fast I started to add a second day (Wednesday), by first doing a 16 hour fast that day, then the next week doing an OMAD that day, then the next week making it a 36 hour fast.


In general I‚Äôve found the easiest fasts are sleep-to-sleep fasts where I stop eating before bed and eat again after waking up.  Anything where I stop eating early in the day, or I have to wait most of the day before breaking my fast‚Ä¶ just doesn‚Äôt work for me.



I break the fast easy, with either an avocado, kimchi, some kefir, or scrambled eggs.¬† You‚Äôll want to be near a toilet for a few hours your first few times.


I‚Äôve done two longer fasts at 60 hours, about 3 months apart, to kick me out of a plateau.  Those were crazy hard but it worked and I felt amazing for days after.  I‚Äôm going to reserve these to every 3-4 months.



**DIET**

I do a healthy keto diet.¬† I avoid sugar (including fruit), most starches (including bread, pasta, rice, and potatoes), seed oils (canola, safflower, sunflower, cottonseed, corn, peanut, soybean, ‚Äúvegetable‚Äù), and ultra processed foods (all the chemicals).¬† I will eat some beans/lentils in moderation, infinite vegetables, and meat/egg/cheese.¬† You can put olive oil on things, but I don‚Äôt heat it up.¬† I cook with either tallow, ghee, coconut oil, or algae oil.



I don‚Äôt count calories ever.¬† I eat until I‚Äôm full.¬† I try not to snack too much and instead carbonate water helps me feel full if I want a snack.¬† My typical breakfast is steak and 4 eggs or a 6 egg omelette with cheese and bacon.¬† My typical lunch is a large salad with about a pound of salmon and no dressing, or pulled port on a pile of broccoli (no sugary sauces).¬† My usual dinner is a half a chicken (one breast, thigh, leg, and wing) with a bunch of saut√©ed veggies.¬† If I ever have a snack, its once in a day and it‚Äôs a small amount of jerky, some cheese, some peanuts/macadamia/pistachios, or celery with peanut butter (real stuff, no additives).



I will have a cheat meat every couple weeks or so: go out for pasta or have ice cream with my daughter.¬† This isn‚Äôt a cheat day, just a meal.¬† And I usually position it the day before a fast.



**EXERCISE**

Two types here: walking and weight training.



Walking, I do 4 miles 1-2 times a week with the dogs, usually on a weekend and almost always on a fasting day.¬† Additionally, go for a short 10 minute walk after dinner whenever you can.



I do weight training 3-4 times a week. I never weight lift on a fasting day, but I will always workout fasted (e.g. before the 7:30am meal on an eating day).¬† I do the typical thing here: leg day, back/bi day, chest/tri day.¬† My workouts are usually 60 minutes with about 15 of that reserved for warmups before and stretching after.  I found time for this by getting up at 5am, 90 minutes earlier than normal.  Only thing I could make work.


**MEDICAL TESTS**

In addition to losing the weight, I did hydro static testing.  Only 15 pounds was lean mass loss, and I even think that‚Äôs high since my baseline tests were after eating, and my follow ups were fasted.

My triglycerides are down 40%, my cholesterol dropped to 160 with my HDL increasing, cardiac inflammation markers down 50%, and kidney/liver/gallbladder function improved.  Liver fat isn‚Äôt an issue anymore (ALT went from 55 to 20) and my A1C went from 5.7 to 5.5 as of 4 months ago (retesting next week).


**MAINTENANCE**

Not sure what‚Äôs gonna work for me for maintenance, so what I‚Äôm planning is to drop to a single 36 hour fast per week (turning it into a 60 3-4 times a year), introduce berries and possibly sweet potatoes into my diet, and then change nothing else.


**NOTE ON ALCOHOL**

I mostly quit drinking.¬† I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way really make it work.¬† Theoretically your body can process up to a drink a day without causing harm, but that will occupy your liver from doing other work for your body.¬† Since I‚Äôve started a year ago I‚Äôve drank maybe 8 times, and when I do I‚Äôve maxed out at 2 drinks, but was mainly just one drink.  Non-alcoholic beer tastes good nowadays and seems pretty socially acceptable, so you can always nurse one of those on occasion (though they have carbs).",14,1729391911.0,intermittentfasting,3,0.9,False

Wrapper: Nicaraguan Sun Grown (Jalapa)
Binder: Nicaraguan (Double Binder)
Filler: Nicaraguan
Size: 5 X 50 Robusto (Box-Pressed)
Strength: Medium/Full

My first ever Plasencia. He‚Äôs a soft boxed press with a beautiful oily sheen. Darker than my usual go to Connecticut with almost a copper penny coloring. First sniff gives me some sweetness followed by some spice. It smells like fall should. Triple cap is beautifully applied. V-cut is perfect. Cold draw gives off a ton of nuttiness and earthiness. Foot toasts amazingly even. The construction on this guy is SOLID. 

1/3 I get an incredibly full bodied tobacco experience (would probably be medium to most but I‚Äôm building up lol) Strong flavors of spice and coffee. This guy is creeeeeemy yum. Resting smell gives off an autumnal delight of earthiness like leaves and pumpkin spice. Burn line is straight as a pin. Zero ash dropage. He holds strong. 

2/3 starting to hit those sweeter notes. Vanilla is hitting the front with black pepper on the back. He remains incredibly creamy. I have zero fault to find in this flavor profile at all. Resting smell is still giving me autumn in all its glory. I‚Äôm enjoying the weight of this stick in my hand. Lost my ash about halfway into the second half of the third. Right on my damn shoe. Oh well lol I tried. 

3/3 sweeter notes are more nuanced now with some caramel and cocoa to go with the vanilla. More cinnamon spicy than black pepper now. Getting to that last bit and I don‚Äôt find myself overwhelmed with char yet. Consider me impressed as this is where I usually give in. I smoke this guy to the nub and completely enjoy every puff. 

Overall I‚Äôm highly impressed with my first Plasencia. I will absolutely be trying more of this line along with another Fuego. I quite honestly have no complaints at all. Zero nic fatigue (that was my worry going heavier). Paired well with my Dr Pepper. He left we wanting more. I rate this guy at a 9.5/10. ",5,1729391845.0,cigar_refuge,0,1.0,False

For the past few months I've gotten on well with my housemates and I'd even consider myself friends with Housemate A; we talk about TV shows and sometimes sit in the communal room for hours and I've leant them fridge space, let them in the front door whenever they forget their keys, have gotten their packages, cooked food and shared it with them, leant perfume, given the left overs of my perfume (I bought a new one before it ran out), gave one of my teddies and leant any items. Housemate A has also leant me their cooking items and cooked food for me and leant me a few household items such as washing up items.

My and housemate A talk about a LOT of things in depth, sex included. I've been very open about my sex life; I was only with one person for 6 years until recently and started testing the waters with other people. I moved into this house when I started testing said waters.
I am interested in kink and we've talked a bit about it and they've always been very receptive and conversed back with me. It never felt like an unwanted conversation and they talked about their sex life too.

I also do OF. They bought it up once and I said I'd try it one day and they said the same thing and even showed me tiktoks of an OF tiktok creator we both knew and laughed at some of the memes. I started doing OF and when I spoke about it they changed their tune and were like ""I don't think I could do it"" was like oh, okay, that's fair enough.

Now, over the past 7 months I've been here, I've slept with 3 people. I've had 5 people over and the amount of visits I had was about 10 in total. 
I asked once if it was okay to have one of those people over and Housemate A and B said yes and A had told me I don't need to ask and that no one follows the contract anyway. I was like coolio and actually forgot asking was even a thing I was supposed to do tbh. 

I recently had someone over, I spoke to A about it and we talked about some of the stuff this person wanted me to do. Very painful stuff to himself, inflicted by me; crotch standing, some wax and a riding crop- oh and a spiky pinwheel. Actually not what I'm into at all but I know the person very well and thought it'd be a change of pace- its nothing I've ever done before, the most I've had are like slaps to my face and been choked and I really wanted to step outside my comfort zone. I spoke in depth to A about this and they never said anything just laughed at some of the stuff and what not and we talked normally. They said they couldn't do thst unless they were getting paid for it.

The next morning after my friend came over I'm very ashamed to admit I felt a little embarrassed that I told A in such detail about the stuff and to rectify it, I thought it would be a good idea if I lied. I said I got paid to do it because I felt like the judgement would be less. I'm fucking stupid. 
A few hours later I get a message from housemate A. It's basically saying (in short):

 ""You are in the house everyday but B and I are out at work. You leave mess everywhere, there are always boxes everywhere constantly filling up the bins and the sides are always filthy, because of your stuff always being in the sink we cant clean our stuff. You keep brining guys over. Thanks to you, I don't feel like I can bring my kids around because you always have people over (Housemate A doesn't live with their kids- also don't slate them for as what happened was completely out of their hands.) You always have people over and we don't get asked if it's okay.  I have spoken to B and if this mess isn't cleaned up by (1 hour before I saw the note) and if you have another person over tonight, Housemate B is going to flip. I will take pictures of the mess.""
I was and still am genuinely baffled and was really anxious and kinda angry and upset. Above, I explained how many guys I've slept with. Not that many to be honest and it only makes 4 in my lifetime... not that it matters anyway???

The thing is, the bins get very full quickly, we have 1 bin between 3 housemates and sometimes when any of us order stuff, it fills quicker. I started keeping boxes in my room because I felt bad for taking up so much bin space and even bought a bin compresser. I've definitely left mess, I wont say I haven't- I have ADHD and sometimes I don't always clean and stay organised. Whenever there was a mess, I apologised and Housemate A would always say it's okay, they've got mess too. When people come over I spring clean my room and sometimes (I want to say 3 times?) I put my stuff in the sink and don't clean it cause I'm rushing.

For the past few months I've bought about 4 bottles of washing up liquid and 3 packs of sponges. I've bought black bins 3 times and some small ones once. I've bought a toilet scrub, a toilet scent thing, spray for the toilet, washing up dish cloths and lots of toilet paper. One time I'd gone out for 2 days and left an entire new loo roll in the bathroom and I came back and it was half gone.

Recently the other housemates don't take the bins out. In the first month I did slack taking the bins out because I couldn't always remember what one was put out and I apologised if I forgot. I've taken them out for about 3 months now. I'd forgot (often) our bins get FULL and there's lots of bags of stuff. This is the only sort of thing I felt like maybe that had a bit of conflict, I felt like they were always expecting me to take them out because they both work full time jobs away from home and I work part time and I'm in the house. They'd never said anything but it had been hinted (I can't remember now but I remember thinking, does that mean they want me to always do it because theyre not in?) So whenever I forgot I always apologised as if it was duty. The one time B took out the bins and asked me to bring the back in, I forgot to bring them back in so I cleaned the kitchen and bathroom as an apology. Infact, I cleaned so hard the algae and mould that was in the shower seal was GONE. I fucking shoved a wire up that shit and cleaned it like it was my last day on earth.

Also sometimes I've left my own mess in the sink, I've cleaned up everyone else's too as an apology. I think I've done this twice out of about the 3 or so times I've left stuff in the sink (a guess cause I don't remember exactly.) There's been black mould in the washing machine and on the sides of the sink seal and I've obliterated the shit out of that too.

I explained how I felt in my message and sent it and I felt a bit slighed by all this so I took all my stuff. I cleaned up my mess- 3 bowls, 2 plates and a mug, I put my rice cooker bowl away and a takeaway bag I'd been using as a bin because the bins were outside (I usually put these bags in my own room if the bins are full but I just can't always stand the smell on my own room and A left a load of curry out for a week so it STUNK everytime I went to the bathroom so I thpight it woild be okay, mine was left out for 2 MAYBE 3 days). The irony there is the sink has a lot of things in that aren't mine and there was stuff on the side thst all belongs to A, also the washing machine is full of moully items- like WHITE, coated, mould. The scheduled cleaners took a good 70% of the stuff out of it a week or 2 ago and cleaned it (using all my washing up liquid or they stole it idk) and there are still mouldy items in that washing machine. A also leaves a lot of meat out, Ive turned the oven on twice to preheat and once found a whole fucking chicken in there- and it stayed in there for a food few days and Ive found other meat in there too or on the side (Im genuinly impressed by their stomach and the fact they dont have food posioning EVER) and they've left mouldy veg. Ive left dirty items in the sink and it was full but ive never let them go mouldly.. infact when A leaves coffee on the side I've poured their mould out. Maybe I'm being really petty when I say this but when I cleaned up my stuff, it barely made a difference but after writing my response according to the letter I had like 30 minutes left of time before B came back and A took pictures of all the mess and blamed it on me. 

I can't lie, I was petty. I took my amazon firestick, my bathroom mat, my soap, my sponges, my washing up towels, 120 rolls of toilet paper ( I got off tiktok for like ¬£20 dont ask) that I said everyone could use, I took my cleaning supplies, my gloves, scissors, spray etc. I have no room in this box room for all this btw. They all have under the bed storage and for some reason, I dont.
When I came out the bathroom housemate B was back and I'd remembered B had made a comment to me the day before when I had someone over. B called me and said they had work in the morning and I was like.. okay? And B said it was early so too be quiet. I felt confused because I felt like I've always been quiet (I CONSTANTLY asked if I was too loud because I can hear housemate B and their partner being piped almost everytime and I was embarrassed to think they could hear me) but I let it go and messaged Housemate A about it AND spoke to them in person and they said ""I had no idea, I just told B that you ""have another partner over again"". I wasn't sure if was detecting some passive aggressiveness with the ""again""- I'm neurodivergent, a sensitive little bitch and absolute balls at reading people sometimes but I just moved on.

Now keep in mind B has always been very nice; charming and jokey and seeing housemate B after this message A had left me, I asked B; ""Did I make too much noise when I had someone over last?"" They said no and I asked why they said it and B said ""I knew why."" 
I said I genuinely don't know why and asked for an explanation. 

Now I cant remember the exact order of this conversation because I was really hot-headed because of some of the stuff that was said so I might be telling this like BACE kinda pipeline instead of ABCD.
I got told that it was because of ""all the people you've been bringing over"". I said I don't get the issue and they said I didn't ask them if they were okay with it. I said well they don't ask when they bring their partner over (theyre sometimes here when Housemate B isn't here btw which is v against the rules, Ive never left anyone here when I'm out bc I don't agree with that) and they said they don't need to because they asked once, they don't have to do it everytime. I was like hmm doesnt sound like the tenancy agreement and they told me to check it (I did, it doesn't really state whether or not you do need to ask everytime with the same person but it does say you need to ask your housemates when you bring someone over so I feel like we ALL fall under breaking that not just me but maybe Im reaching??)
 They said they don't trust the people I bring over. I was like huh? Where tf is this coming from? They were like ""Oh you know why. Face it, >my name here< you're a prositute."" I was like ?????? And then it clicked. I was like oh the ball thing and they looked at me like I'd fucking murdered someone and it actually really hurt. I wasn't about to say I lied about being paid, I'd look like a fucking weirdo but I didn't want the hassle of seeming like I was back tracking and also, I support sex anyway so I really didn't see the issue with keeping the gag up. I was like ""So? The person I had over wanted their crotch stood on, I don't get how it affects you, I did it in my room and I didnt fuck him for money either."" B said I dont know these people I bring over and it's jeprodizing their partner and Housemate A is scared and cant bring their kids over. I was really baffled where this was coming from. I might be an idiot and can't read social situations but when I said they'd paid me, Housemate A said ""bring them back, I wanna do it if I get paid!"" And said it very enthusiastically. 

It went back forth and I got told ""you bring in a new person every time I walk through the door."" Keep in mind. 10 visits, 7 months, 5 guys, sexually involved with 3 of them. I said that too and said well you have your partner over for all the days you're here (about 3-4 days a week) and sometimes theyre even here when you're not. And they were like ""The difference is, I only bring 1 person."". I don't know if I'm taking this too personally but I feel like I'm being shamed a little. I'm 27, I'm trying to have an active sex life and explore because I've been in 1 relationship for 6 bloody years.
I got called disgusting, got looked up and down like I was trash, I got told I sleep with everyone for money (how did stepping on a crotch turn into I sleep with everyone for money? I feel like A and B have talked about my (solo) OF and B has just decided I now sleep with everyone I invite over specifically for money. I got told ""this isn't a doss house"" and some just some really nasty stuff.

I was yelling btw I was not innocent in this, I was really fucking bad and stuck between angry yelling and crying. I didn't namecall B like they did but I said imagine how it felt getting a letter saying you were going to flip your lid, that's not really something I feel amazing hearing. (I come from an abusive childhood which B doesn't know but A does and although I can control the situation in kink, hearing I having an angry housemate just put me on edge. Once again, B doesn't know, I'm just giving context to why I said this). B was like no, I didnt say that actually I said I was going to call the police. Now okay, ngl this pissed me off. I'm half African carribean and something about the police just fucking triggered the shIIIT out of me. I genuinely don't know if my reaction was like uncalled for but when my dad's been pulled over for scratching his ear because they thought he was on the phone, I panic thinking about how police can look at me and make snap decisions. I can't really remember what I said. In general, I didn't insult B, I just pointed out what they did wrong in the house and how I felt and explained myself but I did shout and cry a lot. 

I finished there and said some petty things about they need to buy their own bags and soap and stuff. Oh fuck I forgot, I also told him to stop innaprorioately touching housemate A because A told me that B picks them up and they don't like it, has expressed it multiple times and has even been touched on the butt whole being picked up. I said to A you need to talk to B but unfortunately A never got the chance to because I yelled it at B. I felt bad  that I flipped and did that because it wasn't my place to say, that was something A was supposed to say. A told me in confidence, I'd broke that and I messaged A my thoughts on the whole situation, explained what happened with B and what they said, asked nicely for my perfume, Teddy and tweezers back and explained I don't feel comfortable really conversing with anyone in the house and then explained I'd flipped at B and told them about the whole inappropriate touching thing and apologised profusely for that. I also apologised for bringing that guy over but I did say, keep in mind, he's DBS checked because he looks after someone for his full time job and it's never been my intention to make A feel like they were in harm or make A feel like they can't bring ther kids over (also A had told me months back they didn't let their kids come over because they felt it wasn't fair on their housemates so I just took that at face value so being told that was a slap in the face.)

I feel baffled by this. Ive been here for nearly 7 months. I thought I had a friendship with A and I thought if they were uncomfortable with anything they'd tell me but they didn't. Instead they talked about it with B until it blew up in my face. I asked B why did you leave it for so long if ypy had a problem and they 'Oh, I dont want to be rhwt person whi has to knock on your door and tell you"" (or something like that) Do I genuinely deserve this? I feel like I don't and I'm trying to look at it from all angles but I feel like this is way too harsh. Please, can I get some insight? I feel disgusting and really uncomfortable living in this house now. I'm desperate to move out and I'm making plans to save 6 months rent for a new place. 


TDLR; I've been sexually active with 3 ppl and had about 10 visits altogether in my house over almost 7 months and been accused of bringing men over ""almost every day"" that are ""dangerous"". I explored extreme kink with the last guy who came over and I was embarrassed I'd gone into so much detail the day before (ADHD) and lied to Housemate A when we talked about it and said the person paid for it because A mentioned previously they could only do it if they got paid for it. Housemate B yelled at me and called me nasty stuff and said theyd call the police on me if I bought another guy over, I yelled back but I didn't insult them and just defended myself and pointed out their mistakes. I've been accused of being messy too when there is mouldy COATED items in the dishwasher and sink right now.
I have apparently made it difficult for housemate As kids to come over and visit them but they'd told me previously they didn't want to keep bringing their kids over because it wasn't fair on the people living here. No one came and spoke to me about any of this to me until I mentioned this kink thing yesterday and suddenly both my housemates have multiple issues with me even though I've been close to Housemate A to the point of cooking dinners, giving my leftover perfume, Teddy, letting the borrow my items and staying in the communing area talking about lots of shit.

1) He would melt down/become destructive in the morning when we changed his clothes for school.  He bit an aide on the bus last week and we were getting to the point where the bus wouldn‚Äôt be an option anymore

2) He would melt down coming home from ABA every afternoon.  We would eat dinner within 20 mins but by then he was hard to soothe and get a full meal in him.

We made 2 minor changes.  

1) He doesn‚Äôt like jeans so he‚Äôs mostly in sweat pants.  We just stared having him wear his clothes for the next day to bed‚Ä¶ and just keep him in those clothes in the morning - no need to battle in the morning and he didn‚Äôt seem to care much as night‚Ä¶

2) I have a plate of snacks waiting for him on the coffee table when he gets home.  A protein, fruit and something new/not preferred.  He doesn‚Äôt really eat dinner with us anymore‚Ä¶ but zero issues in the evening now.

We made these changes last week and zero serious meltdowns‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs crazy.
