1gmxwc6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gmxwc6,Designing a Home Coffee Bar,"Machine: ECM Synchronika II with flow control, plumbed 

Grinders: Timemore 078s with turbo burrs  for pourovers , Lagom 01 or P64 for espresso (have yet to decide).

Water
I will run the water through a calcite filter cartridge prior going to the machine. The machine will come with a 3/8‚Äù compression fitting. I need to get a 3/8‚Äù pressure reducer w/ a gauge. I will need to be at 1-2bar. So the water will run from the current whole house carbon filter and water softening set up to the calcite filter then an inline TDS monitor (TDS should hopefully read 80-130, ideally 90-110). Hot and cold pex ran to the sink (not through the calcite filter, just off the house setup).

Drains
Espresso machine needs a drain as does the sink.

Electric
Service will need (2) 15amp breakers or a 30:
- espresso machine: 11amp
- kettle: 10amp
- grinders: 2.5-8amp (variable)

I would like an outlet behind the grinder station. But I want a hole in the counter top so that a flat power strip could be ran to the top inside of the cabinet - so essentially all cords are hidden underneath the counter and no cords are on the countertop (cords behind the espresso machine won‚Äôt be seen). To the right of the machine needs to be a single outlet and two switches, one for the overhead lights and one for under shelving LED.

Shelving
Two shelves will go the full span on both walls and will be 9‚Äù wide and be made out of hickory to match the beam. 

Countertop
See the diagram, should be about 42 1/4‚Äù x 25‚Äù then 41‚Äù x 18‚Äù white quartz to match the kitchen. 

Cabinets: white, matching kitchen, with base cabinet and drawer. Backsplash will be glass tile.


TLDR: take a look at the equipment placement and the layout. This is the only layout that made sense to me for workflow and space have space to prep. Grind and prep on the left, brew in the corner , sink on the right, ECM steam wand is on the left. Can you think of a better way to organize this? Would you do it differently? Why?

I feel like she will be able to buy the building and stuff needed for the cafe. But I don't think she has management skill to run the business. Most people take up an internship before creating a business to gain skills that are needed. But Nat.... is nat, and I doubt she has taken any class or courses for it. 

Imagine her trying to run the cafe while there a bunch of people there trying to order or someone complaining about their coffee or service. 

She never really gain the experience. I don't remember her ever saying she had a job. I do remember the clothing business her and jake had, but that didn't last long.

We setup a small office where we provide snacks and coffee, they are well compensated at hindi rin naman kami mahigpit kasi ayaw ko din ng mina-micromanage ako.

But the problem is parang ang layo nila sa amin. These 3 employees namin ay kasamahan namin sa church before(me and my husband stopped going to church due to toxicity) di naman kami closed nung nagch-church pa kami pero di rin naman kami strangers. They are in the mid 20‚Äôs pero parang mga di adults. If they want/need something di magsasalita kelangan ko pa tanungin. For example, napalakas ung aircon, kahit nanginginig na sa lamig di magsasalita, kelangan ko pang tanungin kung gusto nila na hinaan ko.(though pwede naman nila hinaan kasi I always tell them na free sila gumalaw sa office). I already communicated na ang gusto ko proactive silang magsabi kasi ayoko ng nanghuhula kung ano gusto nila. Everyday before I come in sa office(sila lang) the vibe is good, may tawanan, chikahan pero kapag pumasok na ako biglang tahimik, kahit di ko naman pinagbabawalan na mag-ingay.. 

Di kami sabay sabay pumapasok,, nauuna ung mga employees namin, after a few hours pumapasok ako at sa umaga na pumapasok husband ko, so mas marami akong time na kasama sila kesa sa husband ko.

Another thing, since nagwfh ako, nawalan na ako ng nakakachikahan na friends. I want someone na nakakasharean ko ng everyday ganap ko sa buhay, ng thoughts ko, alam nyo un? Lagi na lang kasi husband ko kausap ko(which I am very thankful) pero since araw araw ko sila kasama baka naman pwede ko silang kachikahan while working pero whenever nagsheshare ako, nagbibitaw ng joke, responsive naman sila pero un na un, di narereciprocate. Ako lang ung may gustong makipagcommunicate, I usually ask them naman about ganap nila sa buhay pero kung anong tanong un lang ang sagot. 

Hindi ako extrovert pero I tried my best naman para kunin ung loob nila pero parang hanggang  dito na lang siguro ako.

Maybe they just dont like me, okay lang naman kasi may mga taong ayaw ko din, not because they‚Äôre bad pero di lang kami same vibes. Pero nakakalungkot lang, may kasama nga ako sa office pero parang mag-isa lang din ako.

1gmxsle,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeatherInInk/comments/1gmxsle/one_thousand_three_hundred_and_seventyseventh/,One Thousand Three Hundred And Seventy-Seventh Night,"I had such a good day I almost feel guilty. I slept like a baby and I got to spend all day writing and painting in my office. I could stew in the guilt I feel for feeling good when I know so many are suffering but I simply don't want to. Me making myself mentally suffer alongside them helps no one. All I can do is keep moving forward.

Anyway, my stomach has also been better. I've eating a full lunch and dinner with no issue. I even had it in me to daydream again. I went upstairs to my office after lunch and got to work. Oh, it is glorious up there. It is clean, everything has a place, I can move around and reach whatever I need to reach. My laptop works so much better for writing than my older desktop; my documents don't freeze or buffer. I am relatively alone so I can focus. Occasionally my parents pop in to speak to me but there isn't a constant coming and going in the corner of my eye that gets so frustrating. It was just peaceful. More than anything, what I need right now is peace.

I wrote 706 words. It's been a long time since i'm managed more than 400, hasn't it? It wasn't always easy, but having that space really helped to power through whatever blocks I stumbled into. When I needed a break, I traded my writing for painting. I worked on the oyster for about an hour. The oysters is supposed to be all in shades of blue so I thought I ruined it when I decided to throw some black and purple in for some reason. Soon I figured that wasn't working and switched back to the colour scheme I was working on the day before and it is looking good I think. Very Georgia O'Keeffe if she painting sea life in stead of flowers. Tomorrow, I think I'll highlight with some white, do an outline, and add the pearl. Then the oyster will be done and I'll have to figure out how to paint the tentacles; I am very nervous about that part.

Now, I am back downstairs, relaxing for the night. It has been so long since I felt accomplished enough to just relax for the night. I have a little birthday cake left in the fridge. I think I'll have some of that with my evening coffee. I'm going to treat myself well tonight.

1gmxpnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1gmxpnw/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

I first properly started my journey into sobriety about a year ago, with a few hiccups along the way; 6 weeks sober, 1 week drunk, 4.5 month sober, 1 week drunk, and so on (going strong ATM üôÇ). I met with my friend every month or so for a coffee or food, she wasn't one of my drinking partners really, she started staying in more on the weekends and I started going out more, weekday coffee catch ups was a good way for us to maintain our friendship. When I got sober I was telling her all about it each time, enthusiastically telling her the benefits or talkikg about how I fell off or whatever was going on with; it's the single biggest transformation of my life and I spoke about it a lot. 

I've not seen her for a few months, she stopped returning my messages and I didn't know why. I got sober, you're meant to like me more?? I found out from a friend that she was tired of me talking about myself, she felt she couldn't talk about herself or her problems, it became the 'BeachJenkins Show' and she grew tired of it quickly. 

I've got mixed feelings. I'm upset our friendship ended that way, I'm annoyed that she couldn't communicate with me, but I'm more annoyed at myself. I wasn't a good friend to her. Yeah, I had all this going on, I wanted to talk about it, but I didn't take her feelings into consideration as much as I thought I had. I guess I got pretty wrapped up in my own stuff that I failed to even consider he feelings. That's a failing on my part, but I can learn from it. Sobriety isn't a quick fix and, poof, your problems vanish and everything is awesome. Nope. There's still work to be done; sobriety has given me clarity of mind, but I need to put it to use. People say the journey of sobriety isn't a straight road, it's rigged with turns, bumps, dips and twists; but I think they also mean the journey of self improvement, and bettering yourself, it has to be conscious, and I have to keep self-reflecting or I'll lose sight of what's important to me, and my loved ones. 

Apologies for rambling, but I just wanted to get this out there. I'm gutted about losing my friend, she was one of my best friends for most of my life. But the silver lining is that I can at least learn something from this.

The Word of Wisdom, given in its early American context, did not anticipate or specifically address many substances that have since become common.

In some instances, they have given specific guidance. For example, recreational drugs are forbidden by the Word of Wisdom, while authorized use of prescription drugs is permitted. The use of some substances, such as caffeine, has been left to the judgment of individual Saints and is not prohibited as a requirement for receiving a temple recommend.

1gmxhij,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1gmxhij/help_me_understand_am_i_doing_it_right_by_eating/,Help me understand - am I doing it right by eating protein?,"Hey guys.

I am doing IF for the first time, and I'm just curious if I am doing things right. My goal is to recomp.

I am aware of the 16:8 rule, but I have been following this current IF routine for the past few days:

* I stop eating at roughly 10PM the night before
* I only drink water and black coffee during the day
* At roughly 4:45-5:00 PM (18-19 hours of fasting) the next day, I eat a can of tuna and ingest a protein shake.
* I eat my first high amount of carbs for the day at roughly 7:00 PM (21 hours later).

My question is centred around the meal I'm eating at 4:45-5:00PM.

From what I do know, carbs will spike my insulin and kick me out of mild ketosis by this point (if I am even in it by 18-19 hours) but protein is also capable of spiking an insulin response but apparently not as high if it was the same amount of carbohydrates?

There is about 45g of protein in that meal, and 4g of carbs. I am worried that I'm ingesting too much protein and even though it isn't carbs, I'm completely diminishing any effects I could get further.

Would ingesting this much protein (despite it not being carbs), trigger a high insulin response and kick me out of mild ketosis?

Any advice would be appreciated on whether or not my thinking is correct, how I can adjust this meal, how I can adjust to eat something smaller/different, etc.

But if you want to sharpen knives quickly for actual *cooking*, you know, chopping meats and veggies, here's my quick approach to it, minimal learning curve.

First, I don't have expensive knives, just kitchen workhorses that I actually use for cooking, less than $40 each: Mercer, Victorinox, Sabatier (not the K Sabatier made in Thiers but rather a [decent full tang](https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-3437312/sabatier-edgekeeper-8-in-chef-knife-with-sheath.jsp?skuid=52805511) made in China that I got on *clearance* for $8 -- best value knife, the one I reach for the most). I don't abuse them, I respect them, hand wash them quickly and dry them right away -- they will last a long time, no rust spots.

For sharpening, I use electric sharpeners (yes, I know), either the [Chef's Choice Trizor Hybrid 250](https://www.amazon.com/ChefsChoice-Sharpener-Sharpening-20-degree-Abrasives/dp/B007MHEYW4) or in the past the [Sharpal Electric 198H](https://www.amazon.com/SHARPAL-198H-Electric-Knife-Sharpener/dp/B0CD22HF7Q). Then a few swipes on the [Bacher Premium Leather Strop](https://www.amazon.com/BACHER-Leather-Strop-Knife-Sharpening/dp/B07XTKTJVY) with the white compound. It all takes less than 5 min per knife, including the time to sip from a cup of coffee.

Is the outcome the sharpest knife? Not really, but I don't need them to be. They get the job done just fine as kitchen workhorses. Do I worry about electric sharpeners destroying the blade? Not even really sure that's a thing, it's a chunk of metal. And even if they only last 5 years instead of 10-20, it doesn't matter, there will always be another value knife on sale to buy. But I don't even think that will ever be the case. I've had a Farberware chef's knife for 14 years now and it's still going strong. Unfortunately they don't make them like they used to.",4,1731111641.0,sharpening,1,1.0,False

The freedom and flexibility of being a virtual assistant (VA) ‚Äì who wouldn't love it? Working from anywhere, setting your own hours, being your own boss... it's a dream, right? But here's the thing: even dream jobs come with challenges. One of the biggest hurdles VAs face is burnout. Constantly juggling clients, deadlines, and the ever-blurring lines between work and personal life can take a toll. If you're a VA feeling the heat, you're not alone. Let's dive into why burnout happens and, more importantly, how to overcome it.

# Why VAs are Prone to Burnout

First things first, let's acknowledge that burnout isn't a sign of weakness. It's a real issue stemming from chronic workplace stress. As a VA, you're likely wearing many hats, managing multiple projects, and often working in isolation. The pressure to be ""on"" all the time, coupled with the lack of social interaction that comes with a traditional office environment, can create a perfect storm for burnout.

Think of it like this: imagine you're juggling five balls, each representing a different client or task. You're constantly tossing them in the air, making sure none of them drop. Add in the pressure of maintaining a professional online presence, keeping up with industry trends, and managing your own business, and it's no wonder you might feel overwhelmed.

# Spotting the Burnout Red Flags

Burnout doesn't happen overnight. It creeps in gradually, masking itself as everyday stress. That's why it's crucial to recognize the early signs. Are you feeling constantly exhausted, even after a good night's sleep? Has your usual enthusiasm for your work fizzled out? Are you more irritable, cynical, or finding it hard to concentrate? These are all classic burnout symptoms.

I remember when I first started out as a VA. I was so eager to prove myself that I took on every project that came my way. I was working long hours, sacrificing weekends, and neglecting my own well-being. It wasn't long before I started feeling drained, resentful, and completely unmotivated. It was a wake-up call that something had to change.

# Practical Strategies to Combat Burnout

The good news is that burnout is preventable and reversible. Here are some practical strategies to help you regain control and find your spark again:

* **Set Boundaries:** This is crucial. Define your working hours and stick to them. Communicate your availability clearly to clients and learn to say ""no"" to projects that don't align with your goals or capacity.
* **Prioritize Self-Care:** Make time for activities that recharge you, whether it's exercise, meditation, spending time in nature, or pursuing hobbies. Remember, you can't pour from an empty cup.
* **Create a Dedicated Workspace:** Even if you're working from your kitchen table, designate a specific area for work. This helps create a physical and mental separation between your professional and personal life.
* **Connect with Others:** Combat isolation by joining online communities for VAs, attending industry events, or simply scheduling regular coffee chats with fellow freelancers.
* **Outsource and Automate:** Don't be afraid to delegate tasks or use tools to automate repetitive processes. This frees up your time and mental energy to focus on what you do best.
* **Take Breaks:** Schedule short breaks throughout your day to step away from your computer and recharge. Even a five-minute walk can make a world of difference.
* **Practice Mindfulness:** Incorporate mindfulness techniques into your daily routine. This could involve meditation, deep breathing exercises, or simply taking a few moments to appreciate the present moment.  
* **Celebrate Your Wins:** Acknowledge your accomplishments, no matter how small. Celebrating your successes boosts your mood and motivates you to keep going.

# The Power of ""No""

Learning to say ""no"" is a game-changer for VAs. It's easy to fall into the trap of wanting to please everyone, but taking on too much can lead to overwhelm and burnout. Remember, saying ""no"" to a project that isn't the right fit allows you to say ""yes"" to opportunities that align with your goals and values.

# Building a Sustainable VA Business

Ultimately, preventing burnout is about building a sustainable business that supports your well-being. It's about creating a work-life balance that allows you to thrive both personally and professionally. By implementing these strategies, you can reclaim your energy, passion, and focus, and build a successful and fulfilling VA career.

So, if you're a VA feeling burned out, remember you're not alone. Take a deep breath, prioritize your well-being, and implement these strategies. You've got this! Now, let's hear from you.

Here I am age 52 and my GFR is 50 . I have worked out a lot over the years weight trained. My nephrologist says that I have more muscle tone than many women and that it‚Äôs normal for people with more muscle to have lower GFR. He is not concerned and says I can bring my numbers up. He ordered a kidney ultrasound. I‚Äôm still waiting to get the results of that.

My GFR has dropped 14 points in four years part of it is dehydration and not enough water. I am committed to drinking water and other fluids good for my kidneys more and more. I have struggled with eating disorders, mis use of laxatives, but I‚Äôve really really gotten much better the past few years and I rarely use them anymore.

","Something I noticed on repeated viewings is even though loneliness is supposedly Elisabeth's big motivator, we don't get to SEE her make friends and socialize, even as Sue. 

We see her seem cheerful with her backup dancers in montages and 
we do see her drive off with her new friends and come home with biker Troy. But we never see her have conversations with anyone. We never see her invited for the one night out. We never see other times of off the clock fratronizing. 

When her career takes off, even these characters disappear. We see Sue's first bender just as her coming back to the secret room to drain Elisabeth. We have no clue if it was all work keeping her busy or if Sue spent time really enjoying people. For all we know, Sue became just like Elisabeth and only had superficial relationships with people in her work group.

Maybe work/life balance is something Elisabeth/Sue struggles with as either version. 

So we never really get to experience Sue enjoy having friends again. I think this is intentional to prevent us from getting too sympathetic to Sue. It also helps make it ambiguous if Elisabeth as Sue could even make those connections. Elisabeth is terrified of being on her own, but we can never know for certain if being Sue fixed that for her.  

The movie is about Elisabeth and her relationship with herself trough Sue. I'm not saying it should've spent 15 minutes as Sue and friends frolicking. But I think it's good that we don't know how much Sue actually had. It ran the risk of making us side with her over Elisabeth. 

Another thing I noticed. None of the people we see Elisabeth or Sue interact with in a meaningful way were women.

Her actual conversations were always with male characters. The only women she talks to at all are saying thanks to the lady who wishes Elisabeth happy birthday, Sue yelling at her PA for her robe (and that was a dream) and ordering coffee from the waitress at the diner.

 It's extra ironic because Elisabeth's viewership was supposedly mostly women. She'd talk at them to exercise, but hadn't had a real conversation with another woman in working  memory. 


It's interesting that in a very feminist movie, the main character has no female friends. Internalized misogyny? Or did she not think other women wanted to be her friend?

(SKIP TO \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* if you don't want the huge back story and just the wedding) 

My husband and I have been having problems with his MIL for quite some time. For the first 4 years of our relationship it was just small digs at me not being good enough for her son. We just let it roll off our backs and never caused any problems with it. We had a a pretty good relationship with MIL during that time, we would see them every other Sunday etc. I was often hurt by comments about my job, personality, etc. but would just move on. 

After 5 years of dating, my husband proposes to me and we purchase a home together (we moved in before the engagement). When he tells his parents he wants to marry me, they basically tell him he's too young (we're in our late 20s now) and to wait until he's 30. 

My future husband clearly doesn't listen and proposes to me anyway. About 2 months after the engagement, MIL pulls me aside and says that she never thought I was ambitious enough for her son, that he would ""chew me up and spit me back out"" and that she never bothered getting to know me because I wasn't going to last. 

This is when things got rocky. We ended up going to dinner with them where I shared that what she had said hurt my feelings and moving forward I would appreciate it if they could keep the hurtful thoughts about me to themselves. MIL told me it ""wasn't her stuff"" and it got pretty heated. 

Husband keeps going back to MIL and tries to fix things, but MIL stays clear - I am not welcome into their family. I even write them a note at one point apologizing for anytime that I may have hurt her and to please just welcome me and no. 

Even when my husband asks MIL why I'm not welcome it's just ""she doesn't like US,"" -- which up until that point was NOT true. I was even missing my own parent's mother and fathers day to spend with them. I was TRYING SO HARD for her to like me. I even made career moves that she wanted me to make (I know this FUCKED UP now - but I'm in a totally different field now so it's in the past) 

So throughout the wedding planning process, I had maybe seen them 3-4 times - which we all played nice. But everytime, it would always end with MIL telling husband that I was not welcome. 

  
(\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)

Wedding time. 

Despite everything, I invited MIL to everything - including the bridal shower. Where she came, sulked in a corner, didn't participate in any of the games or anything, no matter how hard I tried to include her. 

Husband's parents end up paying for the rehearsal dinner the night before the wedding -- they contacted my husband trying to throw their own dinner the same night as our rehearsal, saying that themselves and their out of town family didn't need to be at ours -  even though everyone on that guest list (including them) were invited to our rehearsal. We told them no, we would love them at the rehearsal and if they wanted to still feel like they contributed they could pay for it if they wanted. (This was my biggest regret tbh - but is what husband wanted)  
  
At the rehearsal dinner, husband gives a speech where he thanks his parents a bunch for paying for the dinner. Literally 50% of the speech was thanking them, 50% was plans for tomorrow. 

WEDDING DAY - MIL walks down the aisle with FIL, we include them in all of the photos, we stop at their table to thank them for coming and MIL and son have a dance. NONE of our parents gave speeches - which they were all aware of way before time. 

Near the end of the night, MIL pulls us aside for more photos. We take one with the three of us (MIL, husband and me) then she turns to us and says ""Now can I have one without the bride and just the two of us?"" 

Husband says ""Sorry, we're only taking photos as a couple tonight! But let's take more."" Where we then take a selfie with her. Photos are done, she leaves. (Important to note that we didn't take a SINGLE photo throughout the reception that wasn't with the two of us together. Not with my parents, ANYONE.) 

(Also side note that doesn't really affect the story too much, but they just looked miserable throughout the entire wedding. We had multiple people ask us what was wrong and why they weren't smiling. Like it was CLEAR they didn't want this wedding to be happening. BUT WE WERE HOPING that they would be okay with everything once it finally sunk in that we were a couple) 

Wedding is over, we go on our honeymoon, in-laws go on a trip. As soon as they land from their trip husband messages them inviting them to our house for dinner. (Again, hoping that now the fight of getting married was over, they would be willing to fix things) 

MIL calls him and LOOSES IT on him.

She says the wedding was a nail in the coffin for their relationship. That he is a horrible son and they won't be seeing us for Christmas. 

She says that our wedding was completely disrespectful to them and that we should be ashamed. That we didn't ""honour"" her enough, or thank them enough for helping with the wedding. (Again, we thanked them for the rehearsal dinner in a public speech the night before. And they also didn't help with the wedding at all - in fact, leading up to the wedding every time we tried to bring up what we were planning they changed subjects.   
  
MIL also says not getting a photo with just her was horrible. She claims that I have a solo shot with my mom and it wasn't fair (I did not. Just a photo with husband, my mom and me)

Husband is clearly upset - tries to rekindle things, asks to go for coffee, she says no. Asks to see the solo photo of me and my mom so we can apologize and make sure it's taken down - she doesn't have it. (Because it doesn't exist) 

Things go radio silent for two weeks. UNTIL other members of MIL side of the family start getting involved texting husband about how horrible he is to his mother because he's refusing to see her. 

Husband reaches out to MIL being like ""???"" where she basically says that she is waiting on him to fix things and expects him to reach out even though she doesn't want to see us. 

  
ARE WE THE ASSHOLES HERE??? Like I'm just so angry and fed up. Turning down the solo shot of husband and MIL seems to be the biggest mistake we ever made at keeping things civil with MIL - but no turning back now. ",74,1731110168.0,JUSTNOMIL,24,0.99,False

And I keep working out, so physically I feel strong.

In addition to feeling drowsy I felt high so I went out and to get myself some coffee (which I don't even drink) and some food. There was a guitar center in the same complex so I wondered in and went on an impulse shopping spree, buying myself a bass guitar and all the accessories even though I've never even touched a bass guitar in my life before.

I came home and ate my food in the parking lot roof like I was high with music on super loud. Then I went home and watched youtube and played video games for hours and I was going to take a shower but I decided to go to the gym but I'm feeling a little dizzy and feels like I'm coming down from a high so now I'm stuck in the couch.

Has anyone else taken trazodone 50mg for depression and experienced similar drowsiness and feelings of being high and sort of euphoria?

I (25F) have been friends with X (27 NB) ever since I was a child. We see each other all of the time and grew up together. Earlier today, my friend and I decided to go get coffee together and catch up since it has been a while since we have seen each other. I picked up my friend, and I could tell they were upset. I asked them what was wrong, and they started talking about the election. I let my friend voice their frustrations and tried to calm them down as best as I could. 

Fast forward to when we get to the coffee shop, and my friend asks me who I voted for. I told them that I do not like to discuss politics with friends, because it seems like a double edged sword, however, I want to be there for them while they are hurting, and I understand why they are upset. My friend kept saying that they need to hear me say who I voted for, and I kept replying with I do not want to discuss it, and this is a boundary I am not going to change. My friend then started yelling at me, asking how I could vote against them and their right to exist. I kept trying to calm them down, saying I never said I voted for that candidate, I just do not want to talk about politics or who I voted for. 

Eventually, my friend called me some very choice words, got out of my car and ended up calling an uber home. I do not understand why this was suddenly such a big deal, we were friends for years and this has never come up once. I have friends all over the political spectrum, and I just feel uncomfortable talking about who I vote for because to me its private. Should I have just said who I voted for? AITA?

As a kid, my parents moved us every three to five years (not military). And so I have no sense of home. I turned 18, and my parents basically gave me the boot and pushed me out the door with no guidance or assistance the rest of my life. 

I have been on my own ever since for the past 25 years. At one point 15 years ago, I was staying with my parents after paying my own way through college, intermittently, while I figured out what I should or would want to do next. 

My parents decided they wanted to get an RV and travel and they decided to not stay at their house anymore. At that time, I was commuting 3 hours to a coffee shop to work because it was the only job I could find. When I asked them if I could stay at their house and get situated, they laughed and said no. They ended up renting their house out to a friend of my mother‚Äôs she worked with at a local breakfast restaurant she‚Äôd only known for a few months at most.

Between that and other issues of abandonment, I haven‚Äôt spoken to my parents since. Even before then, I spent basically every thanksgiving and Christmas as an adult alone. My siblings and my parents never took an interest in me, so I‚Äôve been always alone.

I had a small social circle for some years but they all went their separate ways, marriage, wives/husbands, careers, middle class lives, etc. 

And that‚Äôs all fine and dandy and I was happy they were all succeeding. But aside from my dogs, I have literally never had anything at all. Just my dogs and me, sitting alone every Halloween, thanksgiving, Christmas, with a bottle of bourbon and some stout beer.

Tried to build a career or something, but as Bill Hicks said, ‚Äúyou know what my problem is? I don‚Äôt fit in anywhere. That‚Äôs my problem.‚Äù  So I worked for non-profits, civil rights, and so forth and also waited tables and was a bartender but nothing long term.

And I had a few partners but they seemed to almost all cheat on me within a year and lose interest no matter what I do.
 
I try to take care of myself, working out every day, and then reading and trying to improve myself mentally. 
 
But I admittedly had a severe mental breakdown during the pandemic and the few friends I had abandoned me.
 
So for the last four years I have had no companionship, a couple short term relationships that just didn‚Äôt pan out, and no connection or regular friends to talk to.

And now I‚Äôm close to being homeless, destitute, and struggling to find a job after I just finished a contract wfh tech job I did really well at and got along well with my coworkers.

I wish I could just change my name and Jason Bourne myself, get a passport and some funds and just move somewhere with my dogs and just be alone but financially comfortable for once in my life. ",3,1731109030.0,TrueOffMyChest,5,1.0,False

We met about 8 years ago in my home country and had a couple of nice dates before she returned home to Japan ‚Äì but kept in touch since then because we shared many similar interests and had the same taste.

Fast forward to this year in March when I travelled to Japan for a visit and had planned to catch up for a coffee and a chat. Of course, we ended up becoming attached and decided to try a proper relationship. Everything was amazing.. I travelled back there for another week in May (staying at her house) and came back recently to stay with her for 3 weeks.

In July (after the second trip) my gf out of nowhere asked me if we could stop chatting so much (throughout the day ‚Äì both matching each others energy) which caught me off guard and kind of made me freakout a little. She kind of backed off and cut off communication for about a week or two until I could finally talk on the phone and explain how it made me feel. She seemed shocked that it was causing me any anxiety (i've heard that sometimes during an episode of withdrawing, some INFJ's can lose their sense of empathy?)

Anyway we got through it and at this stage she told me about INFJ and that I should read about it (a warning I guess?) and asked me to do an MBTI test which was no problem for me. The next couple of months were a bit of a rollercoaster with her being her happy self and withdrawing to recharge batteries. One peculiar thing was that I really wanted to understand her ‚Äì but increasingly when I would ask about her feelings, or her life in general she would become more and more irritated. To the point of where I would be afraid to ask ‚Äúhow was your day?‚Äù by the time September came along.

In general ‚Äì at around the 6 month mark anybody regardless of personality type will show their true self in a relationship. So I'm really struggling with holding onto the girl that I knew for 8 years ‚Äì or accepting the possibly true version that came out once she was comfortable in a relationship? She seems to be extremely avoidant (I asked her to take an attachment test during a rough time and she got pretty angry). I've tried my best to stay positive no matter what.. which got me thinking that maybe accepting the bad behaviour means that it's acceptable? Maybe I should have been harsher ‚Äì to show consequences? But that would be manipulative and my true feelings are that I love her and don't want to play games like that, I'm trying to be accepting and understanding.

The worst part about it was after the September trip (in which she expressed plans to find an apartment for us, and took me to meet her mother.. which is a big deal in japan) ‚Äì about a week later I felt comfortable enough to ask on a Saturday night ‚Äúare you getting upto anything cool tomorrow?‚Äù. Big mistake. Her texts changed from english to rapid-fire japanese sentences.. after translating they were ‚ÄúI hate this question‚Äù ‚Äúwhy do you always ask this question‚Äù etc. And nothing has been the same since. I should have givn her space to cool off after this ‚Äì but I was so shocked I tried my best to talk things through for the next 30 days.. only to be left on seen and disregarded.

I have a pretty severe situation with abandonment from childhood so the giving space thing is difficult. Anyway ‚Äì I somehow managed to give her 5 days of space this past week and she finally agreed to have a chat last night. It started out well ‚Äì and I had planned to take it easy. Her replies were all cold one worded replies with periods ‚Äúok.‚Äù ‚Äúthanks.‚Äù so that would indicate a pretty dark mood. Of course after a month of not being able to communicate in a dialogue, I kinda slipped up and sent maybe 6 paragraphs worth of feelings... to which I got a reply of ‚Äúyou know I hate too much texting‚Äù and the famous ‚Äúi'm tired‚Äù. It took me a while to realise that ‚Äúi'm tired‚Äù from her doesn't mean sleepy.. I always was confused because it would be 5pm or something sometimes when she would say tired lol.

Anyways I've probably missed a lot of context or important points but my main point is: is it possible to save this relationship? I've tried things that would normally appeal to INFJs (trying to initiate deep conversations, being supportive and kind.. but they all seem to be rejected as if I've betrayed her trust, cheated or murdered a family member). I'm really stuck on how to get things back on track...

She has bounced back from dark periods like this before and it's been great... but I'm not sure if I can survive this happening over and over again if it becomes a habit. It's heart-breaking. I plan on giving her a week's silence from today. From what I can gather from the very limited information she's given me ‚Äì is that she has been in training for a new job this past month. So I'm hoping once training is over she will come back to being normal? But if this is how she reacts to stress in life... I love her dearly, but I'm not sure if I'd even be 'allowed' to try and support her as a partner. Towards the 'end' of our relationship (I'm probably in denial but I feel like being broken up with over asking ""how was your day"" isn't fair) she expressed a couple of things repeatedly like ‚ÄúI'm bad for you‚Äù ‚ÄúI'm a selfish person‚Äù but I just took them as throwaway messages.

If you have any advice I'd love to hear it. Primarily I'll try to give more space.. not send any huge text messages. Maybe just send some photos as nice memories? I've tried being super nice ‚Äì which doesn't seem to register. Early on I tried gifts and flowers which were all rejected.. I was even scolded for ordering flowers for her birthday. I'm assuming the rejections of gifts and things are more a result of the cause of the avoidant attachment so that's a whole other issue. But I imagine if an INFJ was damaged in a bad earlier relationship, then the last thing they would want is tokens from future relationships.

Just writing this it sounds like I'm delusional.. like this girl really must hate me. But then again, she took me to meet her mother.. was looking at apartments for us.. let me stay at her place for weeks even though INFJs need alone time. So there was some effort and love there. Perhaps 3 weeks living with a partner was just way too overwhelming and it caught up with her?

If you need clarification on anything, please feel free to ask away in the comments. Your help with this would be extremely valuable.. I feel like my mental health has taken quite a bashing through this.",1,1731108692.0,introvert,1,1.0,False

Anyways she started to like me during the summer because I would reach out when school was over and always text her and we went out over the summer and started talking since July. Yes I know I haven‚Äôt asked her out officially yet but these past two months she‚Äôs been acting abusive and manipulative around me. For example, she says I‚Äôm a bad communicator and need to communicate better because I don‚Äôt ask her what‚Äôs wrong when she‚Äôs mad or acting distant. However when I do ask she says it doesn‚Äôt matter or it‚Äôs none of my business so either way she gets mad at me. Also she went out to dinner and I was like ‚Äúoh did you go with your sister since she‚Äôs home for a bit‚Äù and she said why does it matter and I asked again and she told me it would make me mad if she told me and said I was being toxic. So she didn‚Äôt communicate on her end but if I don‚Äôt ask then it‚Äôs also my fault that I didn‚Äôt ask her. This only happens at the beginning of the months around the same time as her period. Idk if that‚Äôs why but she always lashes out on me for no reason.

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

Her bialetti isn‚Äôt working properly and her coffee is not good apparently. Having her coffee is her favourite part of the day and it‚Äôs not going well and every day she has a bad coffee her grumpiness increases so for both of our sanity someone please help!!

The gist of the problem is the moka pot is not filling up in the top chamber and it tastes like bitter mud. It has also been whistling/ screaming when used lately. The moka pot is only a year old and it was bloody expensive so I feel this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. I am garbage iced coffee drinker so I have no experience and have never used a moka pot, but I have been looking to fix the pot rather than buy a whole new one. 

From what I can see the filter and gasket probably need to be replaced and possibly the valve as well but I am unsure the size valve it uses (She has the Dolce and Gabbana 6 cup if that helps, pictures of the valve for reference) I have also learned that the coffee she is currently using may be ground too finely. She has like a kilo of it to go so I am wondering if there is anything I can do in regards to the coffee to help it not clog the pot and taste so bitter and muddy, or do I just cut my losses and get new coffee that is more coarsely ground. Would adding a paper filter to the basket on top help? 

I think she has been using it wrong and the combination of the coffee being too fine and tightly packed and too much water that covers the valve and having it on a high heat has broken it. 

Any help would be appreciated especially if anyone knows the correct valve size to get would be amazing! ",2,1731106713.0,mokapot,4,1.0,False

Please i need ANY Help","Ive been reading around and i cant quite find the answer to my exact situation with my father, call this my cry for help or whatever. Im 24 living in the UK. Here we go, sorry if this is a bit long winded.

He was mostly always there to take me to football games, make me go to school and put the pressure on me to find a job‚Ä¶ which of course are all great respectable things that I truly am grateful for. However, i never remember him saying he loved me or was proud of me (and actually meaning it anyway, he‚Äôd say it at the end of a phone call but it was said without any conviction or emotion every time) or even taking any interest in the things i enjoy, never compliments or says anything im good at, never asks how my fight training is going, never asks what hobbies i do and enjoy. I recently took a call off him and told him i was studying polish and another language to which his reply was ‚Äúwhatre you doing that for, immigrants send them all back, scrubbers‚Äù UNNECESSARY NEGATIVE COMMENTS! 

It seems like all he asks and cares about is work and never supports me with the fact I have been diagnosed with ADHD, which explains a lot of my difficulties in my younger years with maintaining my attendance at school and focusing and also holding jobs down, i have quit every single one i ever had (the longest being my first at 6 months.) He says im just ‚Äúlazy‚Äù ‚Äúidle‚Äù ‚Äúgoing nowhere‚Äù, its NEVER supporting words of encouragement, which i dont expect but hey it would be nice yaknow seen as hes my FATHER, the one supposed to be who i look up to and love and look for guidance and help. He says ‚Äúwe never had that in my day ADHD‚Äù. He knows i struggle with extreme social anxiety at times also, probably his presence and the facade he conjures when we‚Äôre out with family, my soul just doesnt like the deceiving behaviour‚Ä¶ i literally had to storm out of a family meal once with a full blown panic attack in the blistering cold to which in fairness he did say after just once that he‚Äôs ‚Äúhere for me‚Äù, then the week after when i couldnt make an event due to bad anxiety he immediately switched back to his old ways and anger/dissapointment towards me, NO UNDERSTANDING. He said angrily ‚Äúwhy can you see your cousins but you cant come to this event with us‚Äù LIKE I CONTROL WHAT SITUATIONS MAKES ME ANXIOUS AND FEEL UNWELCOME. I also missed a wedding on his side of the family due to bad anxiety attacks, there was no understanding from him, only saying he is dissapointed in me for not attending.

He is such a negative person, very racist and talks down of mostly everybody. I cant remember him complimenting anybody while i have been with him, we would work together sometimes in his business but he would pay me at most half of what a typical job pays (¬£40-¬£50 if i am lucky for atleast 8 hours work in ¬£) his excuse is i should be grateful he is offering me ‚Äúeasy‚Äù and ‚Äúno pressure work‚Äù but its high pressure because of him. Hes such a hypocrite for example if i go on my phone for literally 30 seconds one time! he has to make a comment such as ‚Äúnever working are you‚Äù or ‚Äúget off your phone WHAT IF A CUSTOMER SEES YOU‚Äù like i havent been breaking my back for the last 5 hours truly putting effort in and being proud of myself! Whereas he will happily go on his phone or make an unnecessary call for 30 minutes a time claiming it is ‚Äúfor work‚Äù or some other shit that he couldnt put into a simple text or 5 minute call after work. I vividly remember one day actually timing how long he sat down to have a coffee and play on his phone + call his friends while we were working, 1 hour and 20 minutes he wasted while i worked continuously and  had a 5 min dinner break‚Ä¶ of course we finished the shift to which he said ‚Äúits easy money isnt it for the work you do, always on your phone‚Äù yada yada yada. Actually unbelievable.

Its like i can just feel his energy and it drains me, clear pessimism runs through his veins. I have more or less cut contact with him and changed my number which i have not given to him and honestly i dont intend to. The last call we had he didnt ask how i was, he immediately offered me work to which i was busy on the days he offered, his voice immediately changed to a disgruntled and dissapointed ‚Äúwell fuck you then worthless son‚Äù kind of tone. Yaknow instead of asking me how i am or what i have planned‚Ä¶ and i am not overeacting, he is like a baby throwing his toys out the pram with his emotions its frustrating! Oh and you can never call him out on it, he is ALWAYS right! He‚Äôs ‚Äútired‚Äù hes ‚Äústressed‚Äù, because he works works and works when he has more than enough money to live comfortably, buy a house and a holiday home and relax!

Listen i dont expect him to sing my praises 24/7 and coat me in love and rainbows but i just dont feel any love from him at all, hes different when other people are around he may actually smile and crack a joke but its all just a facade until he gets back home into his miserable cave where everybody must do atleast 70/80% of the housework while he does the (most) 20%, everybodys fault but his. He has issues with my older brother which he lays on me while we work or on the phone but he never raises these issues with the person in question in even the slightest diplomatic way, its like he has no people skills (yet thinks he can read people ‚Äúso well‚Äù and walks around like hes so friendly and chatty with people!), he has no ability to empathize and ask nicely and figure a solution out to the problem at hand unless he has total control and everybody follows his commands. My god im just glad he isnt running a country or anything more serious than his shitty little business because the world would be in a lot of deceiving and hateful trouble! 

I dont have the greatest memory of my childhood but a few nice holidays we went on as a family before my parents divorced (and also a few bad holidays that ended abruptly in huge arguments) but i do remember just hating him with a passion when i was young, that i do remember. Always getting shouted at, sometimes a smack to the back of the legs. I wouldnt hate him if he was actually a decent parent right? IM JUST FILLED WITH SO MANY QUESTIONS AND DOUBTS AND SECOND GUESSING MYSELF.


My father has had a history of abuse mainly mental and verbal abuse according to my mother (often calling her a whore, slag, you name it.. all infront of little 10 year old me) (controlling what she wore and getting incredibly moody and dismissive if she went out with friends) a very jealous and sad man are her words (oh and he cheated on all his previous wives, but had the audacity to try and control my mother back then stemming from his twisted suspicions) And certainly physical aggression that i witnessed from ages 9-14 (grabbing and pinning her against the wall, throwing a belt buckle at her hitting her face, actually slapping her one night when nobody was around) (trying to push her down the stairs) so i know the man has his flaws. But i always try to see the good in him.

Hes close with my sister in law, it seems like she views him a lot more positively than i do (although my mother recalls whenever my sister would come round for my parents to babysit, my dad would often leave to go out with friends and leave my mother to care for her.. shes not even my mothers child!)

Also i recently just had a horrible dream/nightmare where he was really aggressively trying to hurt my mother in which i murdered him in the dream, horrible i know and of course i would never do that. But i dont control my dreams.

I‚Äôm sorry if this is long winded and a bit all over the place i just wanted to get these thoughts and feelings out, i suppose i just want advice as he isnt as bad as other horror stories i read on here about constant beatings and worse but the negativity and hate from him is more than enough for me to want to cut ties. I feel confused, vulnerable and hopeful for anything that can help me in any way people.

(also i posted this in here as from my research i believe him to be a ‚ÄúCovert Narcissist‚Äù)

Please, any help and answer is appreciated beyond belief. I have never really got this off my chest. Please.

Here‚Äôs how it transformed its outreach:  
  
Step 1: Identifying the problem    
The coffee shop struggled to connect with customers on a personal level, leading to low engagement rates and missed sales opportunities. They needed a solution that could understand customer preferences better.  
  
Step 2: Implementing AI tools    
The team integrated AI-driven analytics to gather data on customer behaviors, preferences, and engagement patterns. They also introduced a chatbot to handle inquiries and provide instant support, making customer interactions seamless and more personalized.  
  
Step 3: Personalizing marketing efforts    
With insights from AI, the coffee shop tailored its marketing campaigns. Emails were customized based on customer purchase history, and social media posts were optimized for times when customers were most active. This shift made communication feel more personal and relevant.  
  
Step 4: Monitoring results    
After a few months, the coffee shop noticed a significant increase in engagement rates. Email open rates improved by 30%, and social media interactions doubled. Customers appreciated the personalized messages and felt more connected to the brand.  
  
Step 5: Continuous improvement    
The team didn‚Äôt stop there. They used AI analytics to keep refining their strategies, ensuring they adapted to changing customer preferences. Regular feedback was gathered, allowing the shop to stay ahead in the competitive market.  
  
By adopting AI, this small business not only enhanced customer engagement but also fostered loyalty, proving that even local enterprises can leverage technology for growth.

Please i need ANY Help","Ive been reading around and i cant quite find the answer to my exact situation with my father, call this my cry for help or whatever. Im 24 living in the UK. Here we go, sorry if this is a bit long winded.

He was mostly always there to take me to football games, make me go to school and put the pressure on me to find a job‚Ä¶ which of course are all great respectable things that I truly am grateful for. However, i never remember him saying he loved me or was proud of me (and actually meaning it anyway, he‚Äôd say it at the end of a phone call but it was said without any conviction or emotion every time) or even taking any interest in the things i enjoy, never compliments or says anything im good at, never asks how my fight training is going, never asks what hobbies i do and enjoy. I recently took a call off him and told him i was studying polish and another language to which his reply was ‚Äúwhatre you doing that for, immigrants send them all back, scrubbers‚Äù UNNECESSARY NEGATIVE COMMENTS! 

It seems like all he asks and cares about is work and never supports me with the fact I have been diagnosed with ADHD, which explains a lot of my difficulties in my younger years with maintaining my attendance at school and focusing and also holding jobs down, i have quit every single one i ever had (the longest being my first at 6 months.) He says im just ‚Äúlazy‚Äù ‚Äúidle‚Äù ‚Äúgoing nowhere‚Äù, its NEVER supporting words of encouragement, which i dont expect but hey it would be nice yaknow seen as hes my FATHER, the one supposed to be who i look up to and love and look for guidance and help. He says ‚Äúwe never had that in my day ADHD‚Äù. He knows i struggle with extreme social anxiety at times also, probably his presence and the facade he conjures when we‚Äôre out with family, my soul just doesnt like the deceiving behaviour‚Ä¶ i literally had to storm out of a family meal once with a full blown panic attack in the blistering cold to which in fairness he did say after just once that he‚Äôs ‚Äúhere for me‚Äù, then the week after when i couldnt make an event due to bad anxiety he immediately switched back to his old ways and anger/dissapointment towards me, NO UNDERSTANDING. He said angrily ‚Äúwhy can you see your cousins but you cant come to this event with us‚Äù LIKE I CONTROL WHAT SITUATIONS MAKES ME ANXIOUS AND FEEL UNWELCOME. I also missed a wedding on his side of the family due to bad anxiety attacks, there was no understanding from him, only saying he is dissapointed in me for not attending.

He is such a negative person, very racist and talks down of mostly everybody. I cant remember him complimenting anybody while i have been with him, we would work together sometimes in his business but he would pay me at most half of what a typical job pays (¬£40-¬£50 if i am lucky for atleast 8 hours work in ¬£) his excuse is i should be grateful he is offering me ‚Äúeasy‚Äù and ‚Äúno pressure work‚Äù but its high pressure because of him. Hes such a hypocrite for example if i go on my phone for literally 30 seconds one time! he has to make a comment such as ‚Äúnever working are you‚Äù or ‚Äúget off your phone WHAT IF A CUSTOMER SEES YOU‚Äù like i havent been breaking my back for the last 5 hours truly putting effort in and being proud of myself! Whereas he will happily go on his phone or make an unnecessary call for 30 minutes a time claiming it is ‚Äúfor work‚Äù or some other shit that he couldnt put into a simple text or 5 minute call after work. I vividly remember one day actually timing how long he sat down to have a coffee and play on his phone + call his friends while we were working, 1 hour and 20 minutes he wasted while i worked continuously and  had a 5 min dinner break‚Ä¶ of course we finished the shift to which he said ‚Äúits easy money isnt it for the work you do, always on your phone‚Äù yada yada yada. Actually unbelievable.

Its like i can just feel his energy and it drains me, clear pessimism runs through his veins. I have more or less cut contact with him and changed my number which i have not given to him and honestly i dont intend to.

1gmvgcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1gmvgcf/i_literally_cant_eat_anymore/,I literally can't eat anymore,"So, I've been having a very rough day so far and just found out that this subreddit is a thing, so I figured maybe this would be a great place to ask for advice - not like I have received much useful advice from doctors.

I was diagnosed with Type C Gastritis in 2021. Ever since I've been battling my own stomach and I'm honestly at my wits' end. Back in 2018 I started university and moved out from home and that unfortunately started lots of unhealthy trends thanks to ADHD and no support network that would force me to quit those habits. I basically lived exclusively off fast food for 2 years, gained a bunch of weight, went into depression which led to me not even leaving my bed for weeks - like it was bad. Very bad. Following my diagnosis I realized these habits had to go and I think I've done quite well considering where I came from. Well, doesn't help that I showed my first gastritis signs in 2016 but was not diagnosed then, so the condition has been lingering and aggravating over 5 years, before it even got diagnosed. I assume I have to thank my ADHD meds for that.

Forward to 2024 - I take daily walks, I try to eat as healthy as possible and I've essentially cut fast food, coffee, alcohol, candy and spicy food out of my diet (which has been hard as I love candy and Indian food). My doctor has been prescribing me pantoprazole for years now and whenever I'm doing bad I've been instructed to take 80mg/day for 2 weeks and then 40mg/day for another 2-4 weeks. This used to work: whenever I felt bad I'd switch to the food which my stomach could deal with (which isn't a lot, so I try to keep it to a minimum), I'd take the meds and protect my esophagus by changing up my sleeping routine.

But the damn thing keeps coming back - within 2-4 weeks after the end of treatment. It's not like I revert to my old self when I'm doing better, I make sure to eat mild food, avoid anything oily and too much meat, I eat lots of yoghurt, darker breads, vegetables, fruits, chicken, clear soups etc. Every time the gastritis comes back it gets worse and I've been really puzzled about the whole thing, asked my doctors for years now how I could have type C gastritis even though I did not take any meds or drank alcohol. It's only recently that I figured out that any food could trigger the gastritis (which in hindsight should've been obvious to me). So I've started keeping track of my intolerances. Turns out the list of food I can eat without aggravating the gastritis has gotten very, very short.

The gastritis is back now, 80mg pantoprazole feels pointless (my doctor says I shouldn't have any symptoms anymore and at the rate I'm taking these pills I should barely have any stomach acid left), and my list has shrunk yet again. I'm now down to: Apples. Yes, apples. The only thing my stomach can deal with is an apple every 6 hours. I'm hungry and when I say hungry I mean really hungry. What makes this even worse is the pain in the stomach and the back, the constant burping and the occasional nausea. It's been a while since the last gastroscopy, but I've had 2 for the same symptoms. In both cases the doctor said the gastritis was mild and would disappear within 2 weeks.

When I eat anything but apples my stomach starts to hurt. When I don't eat anything my stomach also starts to hurt. Today I tried some bread with cheese, because I couldn't do the apple diet anymore. Yeah, the stuff ended up being quite painful and I almost threw up. I literally don't know what to do anymore and it seems the doctors are also clueless, telling me it should not be this bad based on my results. My only positive takeaway from this is that I'm losing weight.

Have any of you experienced this and perhaps advice for me?",8,1731106173.0,Gastritis,4,1.0,False
