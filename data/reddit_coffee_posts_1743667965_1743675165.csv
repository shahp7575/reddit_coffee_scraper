I matched with this guy both on Bumble and Tinder. I thought that was funny and an amazing instance. Deep inside, I had a very ridiculous notion that I would like someone who did this one extreme sport that I did--and it turns out that he did that multiple times. I thought it was serendipity.

And he did have an amazing story. We clicked on our first meeting. After coffee, he offered to go out for dinner and we did.

After the date I realized one thing, he did not ask me any questions.

I was a straightforward person and so was he so I pointed it out in chat afterwards. He admitted he was not usually like that and said he was too absorbed answering my questions (I did ask a lot of q). I wanted to show interest and expressed he was interesting to talk to.

He went abroad to multiple countries (he's eventually gonna move here for business) and the time we talked and the quality of convo waned. I was yearning for a deep conversation beyond how was your day. I pointed it multiple times, and he acknowledged and responded by asking about me... but not really any follow-ups. More of just... repeating what I said? Like for empathy maybe?

I was doing my part. I was commenting and asking about stuff he posts. He would enthusiastically respond. I would tell about mine... and nothing much aside from hahaha. Does occasionally reach out for a few minutes of audio call.

One time he asked me how was my day, saying he was gonna go take a nap. Nine hours later and he responds... but only to talk about himself and nothing about my reply.

I pointed that out to him and he admitted he did not mean to come across like he was being narcissistic. Still he does nothing much aside from ask, how was my day.

I repeatedly checked with him about the what's going on, he says he likes talking with me. He even disclosed a few issues and problems he's dealing with that he hasn't shared online, thanked me for some of my advice. He acknowledges that he needs the occasional poke and push if I had a problem with him so he welcomed it.

But I think he likes the attention he gets from people, even though he claims to be a lone wolf. He, an uber nice jolly gym bro, may be veering towards being an influencer/vlogger now, which I really don't care for but hey, you do you. But I really think he cares more about himself more than anything.

Are some people really not into deep chats or I'm just refusing to see it as what it is--that he's just not that into me?",1,1743675032.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I won’t even comment on some of the interactions I’ve had with the people in this city but the younger generations are polite and have a good attitude. 

It was impossible to let my guard down and relax even a little anytime I step foot outside. I would start sweating just thinking about crossing the next major street. I’m so glad to be flying out of here tonight heading to Danang. 

This is one of those places that’s for sure way overhyped thanks to all the social media trolls and I wouldn’t come back even if it was for free.

I have been making coffee with my aeropress for about two years now and I think I want to get into espresso. I mostly drink decaf funnily, but once a week I allow myself to get bomboclat of caffeine due to sensitivity. I still really enjoy the taste of coffee and I do like the taste of decaf as well.  
Bottom line is im pretty budget constricted and want to get my first espresso machine  
I know in the US or some parts of Europe the price difference between the two models isnt that big. **But where I live the 685 is around 180$ and the 885 is around 300$**

Question is if the difference is justified here? If I get the 685 I will probably upgrade the steam wand which will cost another 30$ not including labour if you want to take that into account. Also would get a bottomless porta potty for either machines

I do like both espresso and milk based drinks so I would probably drink either of them 50% of the time

Anyway preamble out the way, and bearing in mind I have 2 masters level degrees, (and earn fairly good money now ~15th percentile), but after tax, NI, but excluding student loan repayments I've had a sum total of £372,700 actually paid to me personally. For the 35-40,000 hours I've worked in that time.
Worse yet my net value is almost only a quarter of that... Including, savings, stocks, pension, and house equity.
And I've been pretty frugal, I've overpaid my mortgage debt, I've invested (admittedly made quite a loss on crypto), have sold a house at less than it inflation adjusted value, but, I don't have expensive cars or drink coffee daily or eat avocado toast 🤣

- coffee ban
- wine ban
- polygamy 
- secret temple handshakes
- Rock in the hat
- first law is obedience 
- tithing required to enter temple 
- excluding anyone from the temple 
- trans policies 
- the hierarchical structure of the church 
- distinguishing worthy v unworthy 
- General conference 
- General Handbook of Instructions 
- Lying, misleading, and hiding church history 

The NT Jesus would look at this stuff and say what the hell is this?

Really, the more I thought about it, most of Mormonism seems at odds or weird when considered through the lens of the Jesus of the New Testament

1jqeaew,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jqeaew/compulsive_lying_in_relationship/,Compulsive lying in relationship,"Hey, so I struggle with compulsive lying and have a history of emotional and sexual trauma. Things have improved recently, and I’ve started therapy, but my issues have impacted my healthy relationship of three years.

I moved abroad last year. Before I arrived, I began talking to a girl (let’s call her Girl A) about general stuff like visas—nothing serious, just a bit of banter. We were both heading to the same university. After we got there, I started hanging out with her friend group (Group A) while settling in. I didn’t share full details of this with my girlfriend, though I mentioned some of the people I was spending time with. Eventually, I distanced myself from Girl A. There was no physical contact between us, just some lengthy conversations at times.

I had mentioned to Group A that I had a girlfriend, but I didn’t go into specifics. Eventually, I stopped spending time with them regularly.

Later, at a party, I spoke with another girl (Girl B from Group B). We were chatting in a corner, and I had already told her that I was in a relationship. I was also heavily drunk at this moment. Later, I found out someone from Group A had claimed I was kissing Girl B at that party. That wasn’t true. Afterward, I spoke to Girl B about this situation, we agreed we need to distance a bit and told my girlfriend, who was understandably upset and asked me to stop talking to Girl B. I agreed.

However, I still hung out with Group B. I met up with Girl B one-on-one for food or coffee a few times (maybe three), and a couple of people from her group visited my apartment once. I didn’t mention this to my girlfriend. The conversations were general—life, relationships—and I did talk a bit about my own. There was some banter, but nothing flirtatious. That said, in hindsight, there were some gray areas, like joking that may have crossed lines. I eventually stopped because I felt boundaries were being overstepped—by her and also by me.

A few months ago, I confessed everything to my girlfriend(partly due to guilt of lying and partly due to lying), though not all at once. I told her bit by bit about both Girl A and Girl B. She was hurt each time I revealed more (which I fully understand), and I know I broke her trust. I’ve also opened up to her about our past relationship problems—how I used to feel judged when talking about my depression and trauma, how I was scared to tell her the truth, and how I avoided discussing things that hurt me. I realize now how wrong I was—not only for how I behaved around these other girls but also for not being honest in our relationship.

That said, I’ve committed myself fully to my partner. I’ve started opening up more and setting healthy boundaries. I’ve talked to her about my experiences with sexual assault, bullying, and depression. I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, though it’s improved—and she’s seen some of my panic attacks.

I’m not trying to use my trauma as an excuse. I completely own up to my mistake/crime or whatever maybe be appropriate. I am a scum for doing this but I am looking to improve. I am deeply regretful and working hard to grow and improve—for myself and as a partner. I’m in therapy now because I know I have unresolved trauma and unhealthy patterns that I need to fix.

Should I step away from this relationship to protect my girlfriend from further hurt, even though I love her deeply? Or do you think it’s possible for us to move forward? We’ve discussed everything over the past month. I asked her if she wanted to continue, and she said yes, but she understandably still has trust issues.

She and I grew up together, met in 2nd grade. We would attend karate classes together, laughing and joking while singing the latest Usher music together, thick as thieves. As middle school approached we went our own ways just by nature of development and new horizons. She went from Ugly Duckling in grades cool to Class Beauty that made so many of us boys jaw-drop at her. It was like a scene from a movie. After high school, I get this bright idea to try out a strip club out of curiosity. First dancer I see at the main stage comes backward toward me, but stops dancing entirely as she gazes at me. It was M(the friend) and we both get ecstatic yet awkward. I watch from the sidelines after briefly catching uo, and her boyfriend walks in as they side-bar, and something about him seemed off, but I couldn't prove anything. Feeling ashamed and weirded about the entire experience, I vowed to stay out of strip clubs for good. It broke my heart to see her there, honestly. A few years later, I see her on social media as People You May Know, and reach put. She seems very thrilled. I had just gotten into my dream career where legal standard is of utmost importance. We agree to meet over coffee. She arrives 1.5 hours late. When she walks in, my heart sank. Her hair was bleached blonde, wired and unkempt, thin....her face sunken in, track marks on her arms that she tried to hide in flannel sleeves. In my line of work, those signs were clues for a suggestion of hers that scared me. She seemed very obviously excited opposed to most, in having me over, and suggested I bring my PS4 over. In the moment, I panicked at the totality and saw it as a staged robbery. On top of that, my line of work forbids contact with someone in that lifestyle, and I JUST started. I could see she was suffering....but I chose longevity and safety over the chance....it shattered me to see her fall so far....but at the time I just couldn't risk my entire future on a bad chance-decision....every person I tried to help has either used me, manipulated me, or full on abandoned me. I listened to my gut that time. 

Well.....a curious search of her phone number in Google revealed she was also now a prostitute. This discovery only cemented my theory of the staged robbery. Leverage of my career-standing to hold silence lest I lose my job for associating, pimp could easily make it look like she and he were strangers, so on and so on. That's what I rationalized.....because I was scared. I found out 2 days ago through a deep search of her background that she not only lost her boyfriend from the club to an overdose and bore his child...she lost full custody of that child to a man I've never heard of before, and was living in her car. My childhood friend....fallen to such depths....and opted to score a dose of her usual vice and apparently downed the whole supply in a single dose injection.

I sit here at work wondering....what if I was so wrong? What if she was crying put for help back then, and I abandoned her like everyone else did to me!? What if ""I"" was who she was needing to keep this from happening!? What if I hadn't been so afraid due to past traumas that I took the leap of faith for an old friend? What if every choice I made until now has been wrong? Lately I've been confronting old wounds that my therapist says I've learned to heavily compartmentalize and do so very well...and taking stock of my life I see just how much of a shit I really am. I have leaned into the idea of doing myself in about an hour ago...rationalizing that it's what is deserved, that despite trying to be there for people who don't seem to want me around....maybe my passing will be the very incident to bring those people together, if even for a short while....or maybe I'll be quickly forgotten, which would be just as well. I've been sitting here listening yo Closing In by Imogen Heap, by Funeral Dirge for ""M"" , just losing my marbles trying to understand if my ""loss""; if you can call it that, would be the best thing, or worst thing for those who supposedly know me. I lost everyone I cared about due to the passage of time, either that or they just got tired of me. Outside of that, there are those who abused and mistreated my soul on purpose, and I was blamed for when I stood my ground by mutual friends. I'm a 34 going on 34M with minimal dating experience because my therapist says my actions are akin to putting myself on the Used Car lot in an Old Money Town. Old Money doesn't buy a 2007 rusted Toyota for the long term, they just need it to get by until the next best thing...and thats what I've been allowing to happen. Old Money wants the highest end latest model vehicle woth the bells and whistles, not the rusted dumper. He did not refer to me as such, he means I'm simply offering myself AS such to the wrong crowd.....but again....has been wrong choice aftwr wrong choice.

I still sit here wondering what I could have done differently for M....how I know I couldn't realistically risk my future for the off-chance I was correct thag she needed my help....but still wonder how I must have been dead wrong to leave her to her own devices. She isn't the only xhilldhood friend who is now in Forever Nap Mode either....and I just keep choosing the wrong things, every time....!!! Maybe the universe is hinting at me to just....stop TRYING so hard and..do what I was always suppose to do....maybe I don't HAVE a place here....or deserve one. I let you down M.....you needed me and I wasnt....Fucking THERE for you! I walked away and THIS....YHIS is what happens!! Either I lose parts of my soul by being used for my help and left behind, or I DONT and people die...no middle ground. I don't GET tk NOT help anymore. THIS is why I am stuck in patterns of being manipulated, because THIS is what happens. I'm not allowed to be anything more than the side-NPC for the Main Characters. I'm rambling, sorry....I'm typing as I think...the grief is finally kicking in......it's hard to watch an old unrequited love fall....only to see then crawl back in the worst state of existence only tk realize you just....walked the FUCK away ""Like a G"" who took care of himself.

**TLDR: My crazy ex abused me mentally for years and is now pretending to be the victim and I am having a hard time to cope with the anger because of it.**



Hi everyone,

here is a little story of my last relationship:

My last relationship lastet 12 years and was very good for the first 8 years, bad for the the next 2 years and an absolute nightmare for the last 2 years.

My Ex was always very egocentric and (looking back) narcistic, which I didn't see most of the time I knew her. She was a very kind and loving person when she was in a good mood but an absoulte nightmare and evil human when she was angry.

She manipulated me in a way that I at some point just did whatever I could not to make her angry and bend as much as I could so she didn't have a reason to be unhappy with something.

Whenever she did become angry (which happened reguarly as it was her way to let out stress) she verbally abused me with regular comments like this:

\- You're human trash

\- You're boring and a fucking loser

\- I only do sport to not look as bad as you

\- I am never jelous as there is no other women who is interested in you anyway

\- You're as stupid as a dog, but at least I can teach him some tricks

These are just some examples as she was very creative in this aspect. I talked with her about it many times and tried to make her aware how she treats me, but she didn't care. I also ""fought back"" by trying to argument with her and explaining that she is ruining our relationship with it. All of that did not work as she never (not even once) in our whole relationship either apologized for anything or agreed that she was at fault. Her reasoning for treating me that way was ""You force me to say these things to you, because of your own behavour"". This all happened while she also relied on me earning money as she was a student and also doing the chores as ""her time is to valueble for that"". I feel very stupid writing this and looking back, how little I respected my self to let her go away with it. But that also shows how good of a manipulator she is.

After two years of this I then finally decided to break up with her, which looking back should have happened much sooner.

I moved out and went to my parents for the time being. She seemed sad and in the beginning I was too. But after some weeks without being in fights constantly I realized that it was the rigth decission and I am so much happier right now as I ever been with her. 

Heres the problem:

When we broke up she asked me to not tell anyone how she treated me, as it would affect her private life and her job (she is a teacher). I being to nice to her as always agreed and told everyone that we simply ""grew apart"".

Almost all of the people that I knew thru her and also cosidered my ""friends"" for the past 12 years stopped contacting me right away and havent done it even once in the 2 years that have passed since then. I was kind expecting it, but was also suprised that almost all of them did it.

I also moved to a other country a few months after the break up as it was the ideal situation as I didn't want to live at my parents for to long and my employer offered it to me. All was good and I found new friends and have a happy life.

A few days ago I met with one person that I knew from her by accident while visinting my parents and I was quite happy about it, as I liked her the most out of all of them, so we went for a coffee. Then she told me what my ex been telling about me in the past two years:

I was treating her badly and being a unresonsabible ""child"" that she had to take care of constantly. And I did something ""terrible"" and ""evil"" to her without telling what exactly while holding back tears, which is the reason why I moved to a other country to ""get away from my shame and the consequences of what I did to her"". This is all a lie and I was very shocked when I heard it. The friend I talked with also said that she could not believe it, but it seems that most of the other ones did, as she know her since childhood.

I don't care about these people as they didn't even borther to contact me and asking what happened. What I have problems with is coping with the fact that this could reach to other friends and my family that I care about. At that point it would seems like I want to defend myself or lying by telling them the truth, as she was talking about my made up wrounfduing first. And I'm also am furious since I heard it and extremely mad at my Ex, as she was a complety psycho for years and is not putting her in the light of the victim.

Does someone has a way to handle this, besides therapy that I am currently considering?

Thank you and very sorry for the long post!

Am 2001 born, I don’t have anything to call myself an elitist, and my parents are rooting very much for me clear CA and get a job. And even I don’t our family has anything for a backup, my dad gave me & my brother a very good education and now it’s our turn to take care of ourselves and our parents.

Coming from such a background, I can’t stick to the works that are very old and manual, am a final year article from a small firm in a Tier 1 city.

Unfortunately these small firm partners 90% are boomers (45+) and are very reluctant to adopt to new technology and the new generation, these people turn out to be very toxic. The toxicity in corporates are different as there is a competition for each and every employee to climb up the corporate ladder and there is always somebody on top of a toxic boss/manager.

This narcissistic personality and an ego character of these small firm partner’s & proprietors (not all but most) is one problem, the other one is the nature of work.

Bank audits, stock audits, TDS, GST, Accounting in tally are dead manual and quite boring, since it’s boring and mediocre the quality of work decreases for us, I’ve heard Mid size and big firms have softwares for these to automate manual boring work, I completely understand the cost of such software I agree it’s very expensive. 

But my concern here is how will the upcoming generation manage to work in such a technologically primitive office? One side the ICAI is bringing lot of reforms, updating the syllabus and another side there’s a huge AI rally currently happening and expected to happen for the next few years. But where will these small firms be in the next 5 years without any article assistants?

I’ve heard from someone that a couple of guys who’s just 4 years elder to me cleared and started their own practice with a pretty good modern office space a coffee machine and good laptops for working, and already has 5 article assistants, they clearly understood the game and are acing it. 

From my own experience, it’s been 2 and half years since I joined this firm, no one had come to our firm for articleship.

They come for interview and ghost us if we call back to know their decision.

Recently my boss’s friend’s son said he’ll join our firm, but after his ITT & OC he applied for big4s and got into M&A at Deloitte. 

Obviously, if people choose to go there if they had a choice, but I felt bad for my firm that time.

So, I built a free website to solve this (thanks for open-source contributors like Openstreet Map). You can upload your **GPX/KML track file**, and it will:

I have been making my coffees for the past year and a half and i am overall very happy, coming from bean to cup coffee makers or even nespresso machines.

My setup is kinda classic, with a Delonghi Dedica (bottomless portafilter) and a Graef CM800 grinder. I think that the dedica is meeting my needs but i do have some complaints with the Graef (mostly on the usage, because i haven't compared it with another grinder).

I was thinking about upgrading the grinder in order maybe to benefit from simplicity, consistency of the grinds and obviously taste, but i am not sure that it is worth the investment. I was hoping to get my hands on a Miicoffee df54 but i can't find it anywhere in stock. The other option would be a Baratza encore esp.

Given that the budget is kinda limited, would you go from a cm800 to a df54 or a baratza, or maybe hold on it and upgrade to a ""much"" better option later on? Will i benefit much?

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

**PLATONIC FRIENDSHIP ONLY, AND ALSO PREFERABLY BASED IN BRITAIN/UK. TO KEEP THINGS RELEVANT, PLEASE ONLY MESSAGE IF YOU ARE GENUINELY SERIOUS ABOUT LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM FRIENDSHIPS, AND HAVE COMMON/SIMILAR INTERESTS.

1jqdue8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LushCosmetics/comments/1jqdue8/researching_lushs_fragrance_collection_this_past/,Researching Lush's fragrance collection this past year-ish!,"My all time faves were running low and so I decided to embark on a journey of discovery, and enjoyed myself so much, that I wanted to share the results with you! 

Some of these I currently own, some I owned previously/ would rebuy, and others I have never owned/ am hoping to buy before they decide to discontinue it! After slowly working my way though the perfumes and body sprays that appeal to me the most, by spraying them on test strips/ cotton wool rounds, I only conducted a scent-on-skin tests of the ones that stood out to me from the previous store. What I loved most about my journey of discovery, is how different the scents smell to my nose, vs what I was expecting after reading the descriptions on the website/ customer reviews... Some people can detect notes that others can't, and I find that fascinating!

This past year has been somewhat of a rollercoaster of emotions, so spending my free time reading ingredients lists, reviews, and writing about it, has really helped make me feel like me again! My bf says it's obsessive; I say it's a hobby! He's just happy I'm happy though! 😊 

PS: I had intended to put these in a better order (I rearranged them *so* many times! Lol.) but most have links to others, so it made sense to try and keep those ones together...

🌞 The first product I ever tried and fell in love with was Sun; whilst I was looking for a gift for a friend who is sadly no longer here. It's such a warm and gentle citrus scent of mimosa and Brazilian orange oil, that is complimented beautifully by the presence of sandalwood. It disappeared for a while, and I do have another older bottle still, thankfully, as I fear the new formula may well have changed.

💚 Lord of Misrule will always be my first autumn/ winter love, with a warm vanilla and earthy patchouli allure, that I find so comforting. But, after being my go to for as long as I can remember, thought it was time to switch it up a bit.

❤️‍🔥 Lust is a well known, much loved classic for good reason! The headiest of jasmine scents, it's giving Revive and Flying Fox vibes for sure! If you like those two? This may be for you! Rose, vanilla, ylang ylang, sandalwood, and anise, unite for the flirtiest scent of them all.

💣 Sex Bomb was always top of my list to try, and the jasmine, clary sage and ylang ylang work beautifully together; similar to Lust, but light enough for every day wear. This is my autumn/ winter work go-to!

♀️ Sappho tempted me with orris; which was a completely new ingredient to me. I thought I knew tonka, jasmine, vanilla, sandalwood and tobacco well enough that this would be a VLJ + Lust + Turmeric Latte hybrid... I was wrong; This is an earthy, sweet and floral scent with a vibe all of it's own.

🍪 Yog Nog is easily my favourite gourmand, and delivers a rich smokiness to it's caramelised biscuit scent, that makes it irresistible. I love spraying it on my pj's on a cold, rainy, indoor day! I often layer this with...

☕ Cardamon Coffee: This is a rich scent; with cocoa, oud, and cardamon, which gives it the warmth I seek. While rose oil delivers a subtle floral note for a truly decadent aroma. I would say this comes pretty close to Sonic Death Monkey shower gel (one of my top 5 Lush scents) just without the hint of orange... Need an orange body spray next please Lush! 🙏🏻

✍🏻 Dear John: this was recommended to me in store, as like CC? It also offers coffee notes. You're initially greeted by a fresh woody scent that I wasn't sure about at first, but the cedar, vertivert, coriander and clove, mellow beautifully in this overall earthy, and all round comforting scent.

💇🏼‍♀️ Hairdresser's Husband was also recommended to me when enthused about Sun; predominantly Sicilian lemon and Brazilian orange oil, it gives a creamy, ice lolly scent, with distinct warmth from the vanilla and tonka bean, but with a hint of freshness from the lemon myrtle and oakmoss.

🧥 Vegan Leather Jacket is the most versatile scent Lush has to offer, I think, so it works well alongside most of (if not all!) body sprays. This alluring scent is similar to some OG perfumes they did from yesteryear. With clove bud, verivert and tonka absolute. Rich and smokey, with a distinct incense vibe. Wish this came in a body spray as well.

🌧️ Plum Rain is an intriguing mix of osmanthus, petitgrain and mandarin that doesn't get a lot of love, and I get it; because after the initial, almost overly sweet, clementine? It develops into basil leaves and peppery vine tomatoes. Despite the salad vibes, I adore this for autumn/ winter at work.

🍋‍🟩 Zesty: A sweet, light and fresh lime and that is reminisent of a homemade sorbet that's perhaps more sugar, than it is citrus juice. It's the inclusion of neroli and olibanum, that gives it that warmth I love, and is the perfect summer accessory.

🥱 Sleepy is, to me, just like a hug when you need it the most; lavender, tonka, ylang ylang, and benzoin, envelope you for the ultimate cosy scent that is the perfect remedy after a bad day. I love spraying this, or dusting the powder on my bedding, and also use the solid face cleanser after I've exfoliated... Gimme *all* the Sleepy!

🍋 Dad's Lemon Tree Garden: bergamot, refreshing and sherbert-like lemon/ lime but with a floral/ herbaceous note from the lavender, is absolutely beautiful, and is currently my most used body spray... If Zesty and Sleepy had a baby!

🥧 No Way To Say Goodbye seems to be quite divisive. For me personally? It delivers a juicy, fragrant pie or crumble. Benzoin, litsea cubeba, blackcurrant, with the addition of anise, gives it a spicy note. I wear this at home, so as not to cause offence; I wouldn't want people thinking I smelt of cat pee; as I have two of them! Lol.

🌳 Shade is possibly the most comforting scent; it contains sandalwood, and olibanum, it also offers a hint of sweetness from the guaiacwood oil with soft, floral note. I have the solid of this and mix it with a generic drug store hand cream to use like a balm; May also do this with other solids.

🍾 Celebrate was my first Lush body spray with the most beautiful sparkling orange scent, but with cognac, producing a boozy aroma, it had a creaminess to it almost, that gave me tiramisu/ mandarin cheesecake vibes! I adored the whole range, so it's probably my most missed scent family! 🥹

🥭 Passion (I realise the emoji is a mango, but it's the closest I could think of! Lol) Safe to say at this point that I love my fruity scents, and this definitely delivered! Lime, litsea cubeba and Brazilian orange oils, give a sweet and playful scent that will be very missed when it's gone!

🦉 Old Songs Are Waking *was* easy to wear and had universal appeal, with warming vanilla, tonka, bergamot, and olibanum; some say it was like walking into a Lush store, and others said Drumsticks Squashies. I'll be so sad when I get to the end of this one, and surprised, if they don't bring it back; given how popular it was! I'm using this sparingly.

🧘🏼‍♀️ 29 High Street: previously believed to be limited edition, but found out recently, this is now a permanent addition to the perfume range! 🥳 With it's iconic scent designed to replicate walking into a store! It is similar to OSAW, but has a hint more sherbert-like sourness to it. Instantly recognisable, as I've had many comments of 'You smell like Lush!'

💐 Bridgerton: *was* a blend of herbacous rosemary, sage, and a sweet, buttery mint alongside jasmine, ylang ylang and rose, reminds me of the honeysuckle at the bottom of my childhood garden! It didn't seem as popular as other limited editions, but earns it's place as one of my favourites.

🌼 Orange Blossom: the last of the 'gone but not forgotten' faves, this was the closest perfume Lush ever did to a soap called Snowcloud (winter 2017) and was my first boxing day sale; I grabbed 6 pieces, which was enough to last just over a year. Neroli, orange flower, sandalwood and rosewood is pure relaxation in a bottle.

⏳ Time of The Season: This just feels like a warm embrace from a loved one on a cold, rainy day. It is sweet and delicate from the neroli and orange flower, but I actually prefer this to Orange Blossom, thankfully, for it's earthy and rich tone that comes with the addition of patchouli.

🪖 Tank Battle contains my most loved ingredients of patchouli, clove, and ladbanum, and is one of the polarising scents on this sub; the bubblegum and dirt comparison is very accurate. My bf loves it too, and says it reminds him of cola bottle sweets; I say it's Snow Fairy, but with attitude! Definitely my most reached for perfume.

🐝 The Bee's Knee's delivers a warm and rich honey scent, with a subtle smokey beeswax. Ingridients including osmanthus, neroli, orange blossom, Sicilian mandarin oil, and tobacco absolute, make for gorgeous autumn/ winter scent that gets the most compliments.

🫚 Ginger: I adore all things ginger, so knew I had to try this one! Ginger oil (obv) Mimosa, bergamot, Sicilian red orange, Kenyan geranium and sandalwood oil, unite for a complex spicy, and floral aromatic offering that is a delight for the senses, and is next on my list to buy!

🧚🏻‍♀️ Snow Fairy was a scent family I just ignored for too many years, as the bright pink theme put me off! Cherry meets bubblegum, sometimes glitter too, and they dance joyously together! I owe SF the biggest apology, and it now stands proudly among my lineup of faves!

I 'try' not to blind buy anything (not just fragrances) but sometimes the temptation is too strong, and it's an expensive lesson learnt! Lol. I also have to be strict with myself not to get carried away with spending too much each month, and some of these were/ are definitely a job for Klarna! Those that haven't made the list were simply not love at first sniff, and didn't even make it onto test strips/ cotton wool rounds (let alone skin!) unfortunately. If you've been interested/ bored enough to read all of this, know that I appreciate you, and I hope you get as much enjoyment out of your next fragrance discovery as I do! 🥰

TLDR: So many fragrances Lush has to offer bring me joy, and more may be purchased in the coming months! 😅",4,1743672106.0,LushCosmetics,1,1.0,False
1jqdu65,https://i.redd.it/h2185xoa8lse1.jpeg,I have the bestest friends!,"That's basically it. That's the post. ;)

Okay, I'll elaborate.

Last year Bally Gill (Real!Rashid) was announced to play Orsino in 12th Night at the RSC. I was thrilled for him (I have a weird crush on Real!Rashid) but at the same time I was freaking out that it means he won't return for IwtV S3 (it was when we still thought they'd start filming in Nov). I was also heart-broken because I was in the UK in early Dec but my flight back was on the day that the play opened in Stratford-Upon-Avon, I'd already had to change my flight date once and had a work thing the day after. So no way of going.

If you go back in this sub-reddit, you'll find several posts/comments from me lamenting the fact.

Forward to earlier this year, when one of my UK friends casually mentioned she's seeing the play (she's a huge Shakespeare fan). I told her very excitedly how much I love Bally and would have loved to see him on stage, yadda yadda yadda. I was thinking about asking her to buy me a programme but I always feel weird asking people for favours.

So in Feb I was in the UK again (after 12th Night closed) and met my friend. We sit down for coffee and she pulls a programme out of her bag. I already squealed in delight at her generosity. And then she opened it in the middle and: Bally signed it!!! 

Not gonna lie, I almost cried happy tears LOL

Turns out my friend went to the stage door, with my programme and one for herself, hoping to get as many of the cast to sign hers. and maybe get Ballys's for me. He came out but he had friends waiting for him, so she gave him some space and let them talk. While he was talking, all the other actors came out but my friend was worried that if she turned away to get everyone else (for herself!), she's miss Bally leaving, so she let everyone else go, approached Bally after his friends left and his signature is the only one she got. For me. <3  
  
I'm so touched and so happy!  
  
My friend said Bally was really good in the play and very kind and friendly at the stage door. She told him the autograph was for a friend who couldn't come to see the play, and he said, he hopes I can see it another night. (well, no, but thanks for the thought)

1jqdshp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jqdshp/all_of_my_exes_are_doing_better_than_me/,All of my exes are doing better than me,"All of my exes are doing better in life than me and it feels so unfair.

I left a decade long relationship in my mid-20s, and my ex is doing well and I’m happy for her. We had a good, healthy relationship but we grew apart and decided to separate. 

The person I dated after her turned out to be very abusive- physically, verbally, mentally, emotionally. I didn’t know people could be that way, and I quickly learned the meaning of the terms gaslighting and stonewalling. 
One night a month or so into the relationship she was at my place and I came home from work around 9:30-10, and she was sleep in my bed. I gently rubbed her arm and whispered her name and she went ballistic on me for waking her up. After an hour of trying to diffuse the situation I was distraught and felt like I needed to talk with her about what happened but she refused to talk. Then when I decided to go to bed she suddenly wanted to talk. This ended up in a fight that lasted till 4 in the morning when she stormed out of my apartment. At one point I tried to call the cops because she was getting violent and she smacked my phone out my hand.
This type of stuff went on for 6 months and I finally got the sense to leave.

To sum up the extent of her abuse- one day during our breakup, I stupidly gave her a ride to work when she asked me, and on the way there she was putting make up on, which she never wore, and it looked exactly like a bruise under her eye. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, and when I dropped her off she told me not to come in (when I’d normally come in and get a coffee etc). When I picked her up I asked her about it and she denied it, trying to make me out to be crazy, and eventually tried to barrel roll out of the car. I later found out she told everyone I had beat her and she had been up all night filing a police report and that I was in jail. 

She even pulled a knife on me once. 

Anyways, I saw her on an Emmy-award winning TV show recently and her business is doing really well. And I’m still the “bad guy” to everyone that knows us. My reputation was ruined, except for my closest friends. 

When I met my next partner I developed a traveling bug- I wanted to get out and see the world but money was an issue and I was intent on saving up. Unfortunately I jumped into a relationship before I was ready, and not being able to deal with the loss of my dad and the abuse I experienced, I started drinking alot and I didn’t treat my ex well. I deeply regret it and I take full responsibility for my actions during that time. 

After we broke up, my ex started traveling all over , essentially doing what I and we had wanted to do. She deserves it and I hope the best for her, but I do feel a little bitter- like why couldn’t things have worked out between us? Why couldn’t I have handled things better and treated her well? I didn’t realize how fucked up i was at the time. 

But 6 years later and I still haven’t been able to go anywhere. 

The next person I dated seemed great- gorgeous, smart, well-off, with a loving family and a great career- and we really just hit it off, I mean I took her on a vacation for her 30th and we laughed the entire drive there, we just really connected with each other. But something felt off, like a gut instinct. One that I ignored. She turned out to be an alcoholic and would drink and be really mean and violent, and I could tell she really enjoyed being mean. I don’t know why I stayed for as long as I did but after a year I found out she had been cheating on me the entire time, like from day one. When I confronted her she denied it but tried to wrestle my keys from when I tried to leave. She got physical, I tried to protect myself, the cops got called and I was charged with domestic violence even though not only had I never laid a hand on her or intended to, she had laid her hands on me multiple times. Ultimately it was dropped but it was a scary time. 

She’s now with the love of her life, traveling, living on a boat half the year and working a really lucrative job.

Meanwhile, I have been struggling with health issues and PTSD and can barely work and I’m struggling financially. I feel so bogged down by everything that I haven’t been able to pursue any of my dreams or goals. And despite going through therapy I just don’t see people the same way, I don’t trust anyone anymore, I never feel relaxed, comfortable, or content, and I expect the worst from everyone, I’ve turned into a real misanthrope.

I never thought I’d let the world make me bitter and hard but here I am. And I’m fighting against that, but I’ve changed. I’m not who I was for the first 25 years of my life. 

I just feel like I’m living some aberration of that “Good Luck Chuck” movie but instead of every girl I date going onto find the love of their life, they go on to live their best life. 

I just wish I could be moving in that direction, but it seems like everything I do is backfiring and I’m moving further and further away from the life I want and getting sicker and poorer each day",1,1743671896.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I want to cry so much all the time. At random little things. Like my coffee spills and i cannot handle it i want to cry for an hour. I drive to work and turn wrong and i cannot cope with it. I just crush and want to fall dead on the floor wherever i am and cry cry cry cry.

  
I don't know why. I'm trying to understand if it's my mom, if it's the stress. I do not feel stressed. I honestly don't. But i guess it works on it's own behind the scenes??????? 

I can only assume i'm stressed cause of other signs... Like 2 weeks ago before my moms blood tests (that i kinda expected would be bad) i had nightsmares of her having to take her to the hospital and being trapped with doctors that could not understand and wouldnt hear me about whats wrong with her. Etc etc.

Now we have an MRI tomorrow (previous one was 3 months ago and showed some small growth that could not be interpreted yet.) I know all the possibilities i don't feel like im stressed. I have all the possible scenarios played out and i feel prepared. WTF

Why do i want to cry so much. I want to be hugged and cry. I feel so alone in this. I don't want to burden my partner with things i know he will not ""feel"" or understand. Also i feel like i ve had enough of me not being well and crying and using my mom as an explanation. Is this normal? Like telling myself pull yourself together nothing is making your life miserable atm.

I'm doubting myself so much. Like i need validation that what im going through is hard indead. To not feel guilty for wanting to be sad and wanting to cry sometimes. IDK

Sorry and thanks. Be strong everyone! 

I honestly like this group so much cause i'm really alone in this and reading how others feel and what they are going through and possible outcomes and everything has been helpful. But at the same time i hate this. I regret coming and reading the stories and the pain. Because again i end up crying so much and feeling so sad. And i am like ok you were fine a moment ago, why did you did this to yourself.... But maybe this helps me process. This helps me cry. At this moment i can't even get mad to my partner when he does something i would react to, cause i start crying at everything and i know/ i feel this is way out of proportion and i know it's not about him anymore it's just me needing to release.

I've been reflecting on random things.  
  
I wish things with my mother were better. For as long as I can remember, I've been feeding my mind with prejudices, fears, and insecurities, but at least it no longer does so with the same intensity that sometimes makes me ask, ""What did I do wrong? Why does she say and tend to say those things to me from time to time? Is it because I'm the only son or bisexual?""  
  
Even though I argue with her sometimes, I'm afraid of disappointing her. No matter how hard I try to offer moral support, it's not enough for her, and even her regretful thoughts show it to me.  
  
It's like seeing her on a pedestal where she often says that no one can understand the weight she carries, like an Atlas syndrome. And her way of using alcohol to ease her past sorrows makes me feel worried when she gets to the point of not being able to even stand up, verbally aggressively saying what she thinks of others, how she looks, or even what life is like for her. And between those moments is where I see her as if she were a swan with damaged wings trying to take flight that falls when trying to reach the sky. For me, she is beautiful even though she has undergone so many surgeries on her body, injected things to look younger, or frequently dyes her gray hair. I wish she could appreciate that beauty she has and that there are other ways to face life beyond just being emotionally distant with a very mocking humor that shows her insecurity.

1jqdns1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiftingMantis/comments/1jqdns1/how_to_achieve_caloric_deficit_by_cutting_500/,"How To Achieve Caloric Deficit By Cutting 500 Calories Daily, With Minimal Changes!","There could be various reasons for why you want to achieve a caloric deficit such as:

* You’re in a cutting phase
* You want to lose weight
* You want to trim down your caloric maintenance levels.

I have always found that exercise and diet changes helped to achieve a caloric deficit effectively. As a guide: an average man needs 2,500kcal a day. an average woman needs 2,000kcal a day.

There are various diets and intermittent fasting methods to achieve a caloric deficit. But I want to share a simple lifestyle change which can help you without any major disruption to your life and energy levels.

If you could cut this by 500kcal a day, this would be the most sustainable and simple way to cut calories without slowing down your metabolism

If you were to simply cut 250 calories from your diet, and burn 250 calories from walking, that would reduce your daily calories by 500 calories and is realistically achievable. 

I have found that simply cutting sugar, dairy and fat from your diet and doing a daily cardio session of between 20 and 30 minutes a day, can make a huge difference for your body. 

This works well together because:

* Without carbohydrates you wouldn’t feel as energetic, which affects your cardio workouts.
* Sugar, dairy and fat can be cut without affecting your meals too much. For example, jam on toast can easily be buttered toast (I make some exceptions for fat), a latte could become black coffee and yogurt with your lunch or dinner could easily be done away with. Additionally, a handful of nuts packs tons of calories. 
* You are still meeting your protein requirements as you can still eat meat and poultry

However, you don’t have to do a daily workout of 20-30 like I did to see results, because walking daily can cut lots of calories as well. Walking for an hour would see you taking 6000 to 8000 steps and burns 250 calories. In addition to this, below I have listed sugar, dairy and fatty foods that add to calories, so when cut, could help you achieve the other half of your caloric deficit goals:

* Latte - 200 Calories
* Flat White of Cappuccino - 150 Calories
* 30g of almonds (Handful) - 173 Calories
* Snickers Bar (44g) - 215 Calories
* 1 cup of Low-Fat Yogurt (240g) – 151 Calories
* Slice of Cheddar Cheese (28g) – 113 Calories

You could see from the above how simply having these foods and drinks adds calories to your diet. This is the reason why we have a lot of overweight people today. Because people are consuming these products every day, without realizing. I’m not saying you must eliminate these food groups entirely from your diet (although you could see major results, and very quickly if you did). But I am saying that cutting 2 to 3 of these foods and drinks could do half your weight loss work for you. Combine this with walking and you can achieve a caloric deficit which is realistic, sustainable and your lifestyle could be not too different from the lifestyle you have now.

I am a relatively new starter (I've been there about a month and a half). Part of closing at my job is cleaning up the store and washing any mugs and the coffee machine. While Chris was with a customer I went around the store making sure it looked nice sorting stands and making sure in all it was ready for tommorow. As to be expected, half an hour before we leave customers come in and it's my turn to take them. 

I speak to them and help them out. During this time Chris has no jobs and is just standing vaguely near me. Eventually I sort the customers out, and by the time I'm done it's 15 minutes past close. As I stand up I assume that chris has finished all the bits and we can just leave. Just for chris to say ""oh can you wash the coffee machine quickly when you get up there, careful. Waters hot"" 

Slightly annoyed that chris rather than clean just stood around, I take the coffee machine bits upstairs and wash them quickly, not really noticing the mugs as I was tired and eager to get home (now 20 minutes later than I should have) 

Cut to this morning, my deputy manager and chris are in. And my DM is annoyed that the mugs are not washed. I immediately apologise and privately message them to say sorry and say ill get them a donut or something to make up for it. I'll put the messages here:

Me: ""Sorry D, I'll be sure to get you a donut or something to apologise, wasn't thinking when I left store last night 🙏""

D: ""You don’t have to get me anything, just please stick to what is expected when we close or open the store 👌🏼 that’s not just to you but everyone 👍🏻""

Other people before this commented in the group chat saying ""it's not fair not to wash up on a night unless you're gonna do it on the morning"" 

My thoughts are.... chris couldve/should've done it last night while I was with a customer instead of doing nothing. And since he was in on the morning, rather than make a thing of it, could've washed the mugs and sent me a message asking why I forgot to last night?

A couple notes here: It's well known among the team that chris likes to act like management when he isn't. Chris has previously yelled at me at work and shown dislike.

We are planning a visit in Slovenia i.e. Ljubljana and the surrounding area during the Easter holidays. While there is a lot of online info about your beautiful city, I would like to get a more on-site perspective since we are traveling with young kids and its a long 10h drive. :)

This would be our first time in Ljubljana and we have no idea of the size or layout of the city. We still haven't booked any accommodation. The plan is to be there from Thursday to Monday, (16-21st April) and visit surrounding area like Bled, Postojna, Piran and of course Ljubljana itself.

* Is it smart to visit Ljubljana during Easter?
   * How crowded can we expect?
   * Waiting lines on attractions etc?
* What is the best area to stay?
   * Is it ok to stay 2-3km away from the city center and use the car (because kids) to go downtown?
   * Is there parking available in terms that you don't have to look for spot for 20 min (regardless if its paid or not)
   * If we don't get a hotel with breakfast is it easy to find breakfast in the morning? (bakeries, shops / restaurants that offer breakfast etc..)
* Working hours (This year, both easters are in the same weekend)
   * What can we expect to be open during Easter and the weekend in general?
   * How does things operate in Ljubljana i.e. opening hours of supermarkets, pharmacies etc.. especially during the Easter weekend?
* Any advice or recommendation from local perspective (in Ljubljana but also in the surrounding area)?
   * Interesting things apart from the online advertised ones like the zoo, castle, museums etc..
   * Maybe something fun for the kids.
* Any speciality coffee recommendation in Ljubljana? :)
* Anything else you would consider important?

I was told the night shift would be quiet.

*“Most of them sleep through,”* the agency said. *“Easiest twelve hours of your life.”*

I took it. I needed the money. Needed something simple. Needed to believe that quiet still existed.

The care home was out near Ranworth Quarry. A long, low brick building sunk into the countryside, like it had collapsed tired into the fields. The kind of place that hadn’t been built so much as allowed to spread. Fake fireplace in the lobby, greying wallpaper with birds on it, the constant chemical sting of hand sanitiser and microwaved peas. Twelve rooms. One nurse. One of us.

I’d never worked with dementia patients before.

••

Karen met me at the back entrance just before ten. She looked like she’d been carved from gristle and hard days—grey hair tied back with a biro shoved behind one ear. She handed me the clipboard and pointed to a single name, circled twice.

*“Room Nine,”* she said. “Mr Hartley. You won’t forget him.”*

*“What’s the deal?”*

She lit a cigarette and stood under the motion-sensor light. It didn’t come on.

*“Used to be a teacher. Knew every pub quiz answer going. Sharp as vinegar. Then one afternoon he slips out during handover—vanishes. Gone three days. They find him barefoot at the quarry, standing still as a statue. Blood under his nails. Scratches on his face. Doesn’t speak.”*

I blinked. *“Jesus.”*

Karen shrugged like it bored her. *“Came back quieter. You won’t need to do much—just check he’s not wandering. If he looks at you funny, it’s not personal.”*

She dropped the cigarette and crushed it under her heel. *“And if he says your name, don’t answer.”*

••

Room Nine was at the far end of the west wing, across from the linen cupboard. I passed it just after midnight.

Mr Hartley was awake. His lamp was on, casting amber light across the floor. I stopped at the door, just to glance in.

He was sitting in the chair by the window. Perfectly still. Arms resting on the padded arms like someone had posed him. His face was pale, drawn—cheekbones too sharp, lips bloodless. His eyes were open, fixed on something in the dark outside.

Except the window faced the garden wall.

“Mr Hartley?” I whispered.

He didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

The light buzzed. The radiator knocked once, like a warning.

I left him be.

••

At 1:37 a.m., I walked the corridor again. The lights in the west wing flickered slightly as I passed. I blamed the wind.

Room Nine’s door was ajar now. Just a crack. Enough to see one foot on the carpet. Pale. Bare. Motionless.

I stopped. Waited.

The foot didn’t twitch. Just stood there, like a prop left behind.

I walked on, trying not to check behind me.

••

I didn’t hear him leave his room, but I found him in the activity lounge at 2:09. The overhead lights were off. Only the fishtank glowed—soft blue bubbles rising past sleepy goldfish.

Mr Hartley sat in the armchair closest to the screen. Hands on his knees. Eyes wide.

*“Can’t sleep?”* I asked.

He didn’t move.

*“Let’s get you back to bed.”*

He turned his head slowly, like something had to click in his neck before he could move.

“You’re not Graham,”* he said.

*“No,”* I said. *“I’m just on nights.”*

He tilted his head, bird-like. *“But you’re wearing him.”*

I hesitated.

*“Come on,”* I said, gently. *“Back to your room.”*

He stood. Too quickly. The movement was wrong. Not rushed—jerked. Like strings being pulled.

As we walked, he muttered something. I caught fragments.

*“Too many mouths… not enough faces… they don’t remember which skin was theirs…”*

••

At 3:26 a.m., I made tea in the staff kitchen and sat with my back to the radiator.

The building creaked. Somewhere down the corridor, a door clicked open.

I stood, steaming mug in hand, and stepped into the hallway.

At the far end, a shadow moved.

*Mr Hartley.*

*Standing still.*

*Watching me.*

He was behind the linen cupboard door, half-hidden, just one shoulder visible. But I could see enough.

His head leaned out first. Then his face—grinning, wrong. Lips pulled too tight, like they’d split. His eyes too round, too still.

Just watching me.

I turned the light on.

He was gone.

••

By 4:30, I was on edge.

Every shadow felt too full.

I passed Room Nine again.

His door was shut now.

But under the frame, I saw movement.

Two feet.

Slamming back and forth across the room.
Not pacing—charging, like something testing the length of a leash.

I heard the thud of heel on flooring. Over and over.
Each pass faster, heavier. Like a caged thing building speed.

Then stillness.

Then—

***SLAM.***

The door jolted in its frame. I jumped back.
Mr Hartley had hurled himself against it. I could hear his breath now, heavy and wet, rattling through clenched teeth.

***“WHERE ARE YOU!?”*** he growled through the wood.

My heart thundered. I stumbled back a step.

Then I heard something slide under the door.
Just a whisper of paper. A note.

I picked it up, hands shaking.

It was blank. Except for one word, written in a jagged scrawl: 

***“SOON.”***

••

At 5 a.m., I did a full round just to keep moving.

Halfway down the east wing, I caught something in the corner of my eye.

A figure. Bent low.

Peering through the glass pane in the fire exit door.

I turned fully.

Gone.

The corridor was empty. But on the window, I could still see a smear.

A perfect, pale handprint.

Five fingers.

But too long. Too wide.

Like someone had tried on the idea of a hand and got it slightly wrong.

••

I told myself I was just tired.

That dementia does strange things to people.

That this was all just my inexperience, my anxiety, making ghosts out of shadows.

But when Karen came back at 6, I didn’t tell her what I saw.

She walked past me like normal. Clocked in. Put her lunch in the fridge.

*“You look rough,”* she said.

*“Didn’t sleep well,”* I lied.

She poured coffee.

*“I’ll take over,”* she said. *“Anything happen?”*

I shook my head.

She smiled. *“Told you. Quiet shift.”*

••

As I left, Room Nine’s door cracked open again.

Mr Hartley was just behind it. Only a slither of his face visible.

*One eye.*

*Half a smile.*

*The tip of his tongue, resting lightly on his lip.*

Still watching.

Like he’d never stopped.

I’m back on shift tomorrow night.

If anything else happens, I’ll update here.

Every now and then I’d go out and hang with my friends: dine out, go to the malls, coffee sesh, party/inom.

Everything I needed was a stone’s throw away. But I took a leap of faith..

Here’s what I miss in the PH so bad:

1) biglaang ganaps or coffee sesh with friends (dito kaya naman pero not as sponty and convenient tulad sa pinas.)
2) sa bgc lahat nilalakad ko lang 😮‍💨 sobrang magkakalapit ang mga establishments (dito you need to drive always / napakamahal pa ng uber)
3) parties/bar/clubs are kinda better sa pinas or baka dahil mas madami lang ako friends don lol
4) cheaper food 
5) sometimes i miss yung init, nakakaloka lamig here
6) street food huhuhuhu kwekwek esp 
7) ELYU/Siargao:((((
8) friends and fam 

But overall, I’m happy now. I’m at peace with what I have here. 

Siguro yun yung isang maganda here, you’re away from the all the noise (literally and figuratively) ng pinas.

But I still can’t keep myself from day dreaming of one day finally coming back home for good or idk. 

Ayun lang. 🫶🏼

1jqdf87,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqdf87,Hanging Taoist Temple in Urban Area 📿,"Built into the cliffside, the 7-tiered Taoist temple rises like a dragon’s back, with rooflines ascending upward.

Legend says that during the Yuan Dynasty, a destructive dragon terrorized the Jialing River. The Taoist deity Yuanshi Tianzun subdued the dragon and ordered his disciple, Cihang Zhenren (a Taoist master), to build the temple here as a ""dragon-restraining"" site, thus the design concept of this temple is based on dragon’s spine.

On the 1st and 15th of each lunar month, monks chant for blessings. To draw fortunes, worshipers present three incense sticks as a sign of respect before shaking copper coins to choose a fate slip.

Have you ever seen any hanging taoist temples within urban area?

# 1. 订阅模式（Subscription Model）

**核心逻辑**：通过周期性付费（月/年费）获取持续性服务，建立长期用户关系（Customer Lifetime Value）。该模式的关键在于提供持续更新的高价值内容或服务，降低用户流失率（Churn Rate）。根据麦肯锡研究，订阅制企业估值比传统企业平均高4.8倍。

**中国案例深度解析**：

* **爱奇艺（iQiyi）**：采用""阶梯式订阅""策略，黄金VIP（基础权益）、星钻VIP（全生态权益）分层运营，2022年会员收入占比达56%。通过独播剧《狂飙》拉动Q1会员增长1200万，验证""爆款内容驱动订阅""的飞轮效应。
* **得到APP**：开创知识付费订阅先河，专栏课程续费率超35%，其成功关键在于建立罗振宇等知识IP（Intellectual Property）的信任背书，配合每日学习数据追踪的沉浸式体验。

**挑战与创新**：如何应对内容同质化竞争？网易云课堂引入""订阅+学分认证""模式，订阅用户完成课程可兑换大学学分，提升付费粘性。

# 2. 免费增值模式（Freemium Model）

**价值设计**：通过免费基础服务获取流量池（User Base），以5%-10%的付费转化率实现盈利。关键要设计精准的""付费墙（Paywall）""，让免费用户感知到Premium服务的稀缺价值。

**中国实践创新**：

* **哔哩哔哩（Bilibili）**：构建""二次元社区+游戏化会员体系""，大会员除观影特权外，可发送高级弹幕、参与线下活动抽签。2023年Q1财报显示，月活达3.15亿，付费率提升至9.3%。
* **WPS办公软件**：在微软Office的竞争下，通过""云端协作+模板商城""实现差异化。免费用户可使用基础功能，但团队版协作人数超过10人需升级企业版，该策略使其占据中国办公软件市场60%份额。

**数据洞察**：据艾瑞咨询，中国Freemium模式产品的平均转化成本（CAC）比纯付费产品低47%，但需要警惕""功能锁死""导致的用户体验断层。

# 3. 广告模式（Advertising Model）

**生态构建**：以免费服务吸引海量用户（Mass User Base），通过精准广告投放（Programmatic Advertising）变现。程序化广告交易占比已超78%，实时竞价（RTB）技术让千次曝光成本（CPM）降低62%。

**本土化突破**：

* **字节跳动（ByteDance）**：抖音的""信息流广告+星图达人营销""双引擎模式，广告主可自主选择自然流量投放或KOL内容植入。其oCPM（优化千次曝光成本）系统通过AI预测转化率，使广告ROI提升300%。
* **百度搜索（Baidu Search）**：创新推出""基木鱼""营销平台，整合搜索词包、智能落地页等功能，中小广告主投放效率提升55%。2022年核心广告收入达711亿元，医疗教育行业贡献超40%。

**监管应对**：根据《互联网广告管理办法》，字节跳动建立三级审核机制，2022年拦截违规广告超32万条，技术+人工审核成本增加15%，但品牌广告主占比提升至37%。

# 4. 交易佣金模式（Commission Model）

**平台经济学**：作为双边市场（Two-sided Marketplace）的连接者，通过GMV（成交总额）抽佣盈利。抽佣比例设计需平衡商家利润与平台收益，行业平均佣金率在8%-20%之间。

**中国创新样本**：

* **美团外卖（Meituan Delivery）**：实施动态佣金政策，对新入驻商家首年佣金减免50%，成熟商家按配送距离阶梯收费。2023年推出""全城送""模式，将商家服务范围从3公里扩展至10公里，订单量增长23%。
* **贝壳找房（KE Holdings）**：独创ACN（Agent Cooperation Network）经纪人协作网络，每笔交易佣金由房源录入、带看、成交等环节参与者共享，使跨店成交率提升至76%。

**趋势演变**：拼多多推出""0佣金""策略吸引商家，转而通过在线营销服务获利，2022年广告收入同比增长56%，验证""佣金替代型""盈利路径。

# 5. 联盟营销模式（Affiliate Model）

**信任变现机制**：通过KOL/KOC（关键意见领袖/消费者）的社交资产实现销售转化，CPS（Cost Per Sale）结算方式降低广告主风险。2023年中国联盟营销市场规模突破万亿，MCN机构超3万家...

国际案例：Amazon联盟计划

中国案例：

* 淘宝联盟（Taobao Affiliate）：超过500万推广者参与商品分佣
* 小红书（Xiaohongshu）KOC带货获得销售分成 行业规范：2023年《网络直播营销管理办法》强化佣金透明度

# 6. 授权许可模式（Licensing Model）

**专利运营战略**：将技术标准转化为持续收入流，华为5G专利组合涵盖SEP（标准必要专利）超3000族，向苹果/三星等收取手机售价1%的许可费...

国际案例：ARM芯片架构授权

中国案例：

* 商汤科技（SenseTime）AI算法授权给智能手机厂商
* 阅文集团（China Literature）IP授权开发影视游戏 价值延伸：华为5G专利许可费年收入超6亿美元

# 7. 电商直营模式（E-commerce Model）

**DTC革命**：完美日记通过""私域社群+小程序""构建直接触达能力，2000万企业微信用户贡献超30%复购率。其""小完子""人设账号日均互动量达300万次...

* 完美日记（Perfect Diary）：DTC模式实现私域流量高效转化
* 得物APP（Poizon）：""先鉴别后发货""构建高端潮品信任体系 物流创新：京东（JD.com）211限时达重塑电商时效标准

# 8. 数据货币化模式（Data Monetization）

**合规化探索**：蚂蚁集团芝麻信用分构建3000+维度评估体系，与银行联合风控使消费贷坏账率低于1.5%。每日互动（个推）通过SDK覆盖10亿终端设备...

国际案例：Facebook用户画像广告

中国案例：

* 蚂蚁集团（Ant Group）：芝麻信用分赋能金融风控
* 每日互动（个推）：通过SDK收集数据服务精准营销 合规挑战：需遵循《个人信息保护法》确保数据合法使用

复合商业模式创新实践

头部企业常通过模式组合构建竞争壁垒：

* 腾讯（Tencent）：社交（微信）+广告+支付（微信支付）+云服务
* 阿里巴巴（Alibaba）：电商（淘宝）+支付（支付宝）+云计算（阿里云）
* 字节跳动：广告（抖音）+电商（抖音小店）+企业服务（飞书）

**复合模式创新案例**

小红书（Xiaohongshu）融合""广告+电商+数据""三重模式：

* 信息流广告：美妆品牌单条笔记曝光成本约3-8元/CPM
* 商城抽佣：自营商品毛利达50%，第三方店铺收取5%交易费
* 数据服务：热词分析工具""灵犀""年费达20万元/企业

2023年Q2财报显示，非广告收入占比首超40%，验证混合模式抗风险能力。

新兴趋势：

* Web3.0模式：蚂蚁链（AntChain）探索区块链+版权保护
* 订阅制延伸：蔚来汽车电池租赁服务（BaaS）
* 元宇宙经济：百度希壤（XiRang）虚拟空间商业生态

通过对这些模式的深入分析和本土案例研究，创业者可以更清晰地设计商业系统的飞轮效应（Flywheel Effect）。比如拼多多通过社交裂变（Social Referral）获取流量，再以规模优势压低供应链成本，最终形成""低价-流量-更低价格""的增长闭环。这种模式创新正是中国互联网经济蓬勃发展的核心驱动力。",1,1743670304.0,Innovatorly,0,1.0,False

Turkish coffee was a brew that took many tries to get right. The brew highlights darker roasts really well and just looks beautiful in a nice cup.
I’ve had Turkish coffee in some of the most regal looking cups here in Abu Dhabi and in Istanbul. 

With this style of brewing, the grounds aren’t filtered out so I wait for a while before going for a sip so that most of the sediment settles down. However, this extra time can cause over-extraction since the grounds are in the cup itself so I usually pull it off the heat much earlier then when the foam completely rises to the top of the cezve.

I usually have chocolate covered dates with it but I ran out of them so Mysore Pak does the job perfectly well :)

1jqcy6s,https://paranormaldergi.com/en/treasure-hunt-in-corum-true-horror-story/,The Treasure Hunt In Çorum,"My name is Özkan. I live with my family in Ankara. I want to share with you a troubling incident that happened to me years ago.

I had just finished university and returned to Ankara. Of course, I had no job. I arranged a taxi and occasionally drove it, sometimes helping out an elder brother who was an estate agent in the neighborhood; I was trying to earn my pocket money, but what I earned wasn’t even enough for myself. My mother is an angel, but my father is very grumpy. Just being in the same environment at home was psychological pressure for me. That’s why I often went out to get away from home.

My university friends Fatih, Mehmet, and Orhan also lived in Ankara. Since Fatih and Mehmet had found jobs and were working, we couldn’t see each other often, but I could meet with Orhan. He was unemployed like me, just hanging around here and there, although he didn’t worry about it as much as I did.

One day during our meeting, the conversation turned to finding a good job and making a lot of money. That was our only concern anyway. Orhan was more interested in easy money. One way or another, Orhan brought up the subject: “Look guys, there’s a Grocer İsmail Abi in our neighborhood. The man constantly goes treasure hunting. We’re on very good terms; sometimes he leaves the shop for me to look after. He hasn’t gone digging for a month or two. The other day I asked him, ‘Abi, what’s up, no new treasure business?’ After hesitating a bit, he replied: ‘Orhan, my boy, we actually found a solid spot. But we got exposed too much; the villagers figured out our intentions. They reported us to the gendarmerie, and we couldn’t go back to the village. We already lost the metal detectors to the gendarmerie. The prosecutor’s office has initiated proceedings against our friends. But thank God, I wasn’t with them that day. To be honest, my enthusiasm waned a bit, but the last place we found is solid. If I could find someone to dig it, I’d definitely have it dug. But I need to stay out of it for now. You know, I have kids; they’d be left stranded if I get caught,’ he said.”

Orhan offered, “Abi, tell me the location, I’ll find a couple of friends and we’ll dig it.” İsmail Abi replied, “Look, that could work. I trust you completely anyway. If you give me my share, there’s no problem. Besides, even if you find it, you can’t sell it; they’ll take it from you. You’ll have to come back to me to sell it anyway,” he said. The place was in a village in Çorum. Since ancient civilizations like the Hittites lived there in the past, it was a frequent spot for treasure hunters.

Since I was both unemployed and wanted to get away from home, I accepted without even thinking. “Let’s go, man, what do we have to lose?” I said. When Fatih and Mehmet started hemming and hawing, we said, “Guys, get yourselves together, let’s go. Are you going to get rich on minimum wage?” They were immediately convinced by this sentence. Mehmet’s father had a Doblo van, suitable for loading equipment. “Mehmet, you arrange that, and we’ll get the materials from Grocer İsmail Abi,” we said. So we decided and set off.

We got the necessary materials from İsmail Abi and procured the missing ones. We were ready to go. We learned the location and position: it was a place called “Höyük Dibi” (Bottom of the Mound) by a riverbank, outside a village in Çorum. This place was very close to caves. They had seen two large rocks there as markers. They had received a signal with the detector. “You’ll find it before you reach 5 meters,” İsmail Abi said.

We set off from Ankara on the weekend. Around 6:00 PM, we reached the village in Çorum using navigation. Now it was time to find the place called Höyük Dibi. It was a small village. The village had a coffeehouse, but thinking it would be better not to be seen around there much, we passed it. We came across three elderly uncles sitting near the mosque. After greeting them, we asked the uncles, “We are university students, touring Çorum and camping. Our path led us here. Is there a nice place by the riverbank where we can camp and set up our tent?” The uncles first looked at each other, then one of them asked, “Son, why are you wandering around empty fields and lands?” I interjected, “Uncle, we are visiting historical sites for school and preparing a project.” When the uncles heard about the project, they said, “Oh, is that so? Then okay. There are a few historical places in our village. For example, there’s King’s Hill, the old castle, Höyük Dibi. Look, there are caves there too, right by the riverbank.”

Our eyes lit up when we heard Höyük Dibi, of course. “Uncle, where is Höyük Dibi? Let’s go there, set up our camp by the riverbank. In the morning, we’ll visit the places you mentioned,” we said. The uncles gave us detailed directions. We jumped into the car and went straight to Höyük Dibi. It was 5-6 kilometers outside the village. The location was simple; finding it was easy. Now it was time to find the marked stones. We parked the car near Höyük Dibi, hidden from view. Before it got dark, we started searching for the markers. There was quite a rocky area beyond the caves. We were lucky; before long, two stones marked with crosses, buried up to their waists, were clearly standing there. We rejoiced as if we had found the treasure. “Let’s light our barbecue here, eat our fill, and wait for the evening,” we decided.

We ate and drank, and around 10:00 PM, we started digging. We shared the work; two people dug for half an hour, while two rested. The car was about 20 meters away. When the digging turn passed, I asked my friends for permission and went to the car, saying, “Let me take a nap.” As soon as I put my head down, I fell asleep within three to five minutes due to exhaustion.

In my dream, I was in the neighborhood where our old shanty house was. I was walking towards the house. There was a large crowd in front of the shanty house. At first, I thought there was a wedding, but as I got closer, I saw everyone staring blankly at the house. I asked one of the people standing there, “What’s going on, is there a wedding? Why have you gathered?” I had said this in a low voice, but everyone there suddenly turned and looked into my eyes. The person I asked shouted, “Get out of here! This is our house!” I was terrified. In a trembling voice, I said, “How can that be? This is our house; my childhood was spent here.” The man repeated: “Get out of here! This is our house!” Something was wrong with this. “Where are my mother and father?” I asked. The man replied to my question, “If you don’t leave here, your house will become our house!” The place he referred to as “here” suddenly turned into the excavation site. He turned his back and started walking towards the crowd. The man’s walk was quite strange. When I looked at his feet, they had a very different structure. I looked at the others; theirs were even worse. Suddenly, an extreme fear came over me. Saying Bismillah (In the name of God) and waking up happened simultaneously. “Oh Lord, thank goodness it was a dream,” I said and took a deep breath.

I got up and immediately went to the edge of the pit. The friends were continuing the digging. It was well past midnight. After the pickaxe and shovel changed hands several times, the pit was now deeper than our height. I was digging with Orhan. We had even started daydreaming inside the pit. Orhan said if we found treasure, he would buy a latest model car, while I said I would invest in real estate. As we were talking, a clump of dirt (kesek) came from above. If you ask what a kesek is, it’s a mass of soil compacted like stone. It doesn’t cause much harm, but it hurts where it hits. Anyway, the kesek shattered and scattered on my back. Calling out to those above, I said, “Hey guys, what are you doing? Don’t throw that dirt clump!” and continued digging. No answer came from above. Then one clump, two clumps kept coming from the side. One hit my head, some hit my arm, hurting me. “Man, I’m gonna lose it with your joke! You’ve filled the pit back with dirt! Don’t throw it, man! Is this the time for jokes?” I said.

When I stuck the shovel back into the ground, the clumps started coming down like rain this time. “Damn it, I’m gonna lose it with this job!” I said, grabbed the flashlight, and Orhan and I threw ourselves out of the pit. We got out, but clumps, sand, stones, whatever there was, kept coming at us. I pointed the flashlight in the direction they were coming from; nobody was there. “Orhan man, let’s run to the car!” I said. We were running towards the car, but clumps were coming down behind us like hail. We kept running. When we got away from the pit, it suddenly stopped. When we threw ourselves into the car, we froze.

Mehmet and Fatih were sleeping in the car, unaware of what had happened. I woke them both up frantically. “Get up, guys, get up! Someone is stoning us!” I shouted. Mehmet rubbed his eyes, muttering, “What’s going on, man? How did it get to be our turn so quickly?” Getting angry, I said, “He’s still talking about turns! Let’s get out of here, strange things are happening, I’ll explain on the way,” and turned the ignition. The moment I turned on the headlights, a dark figure about two and a half meters tall dashed past in front of us. “Bismillah! What was that, man?” I said. Then 4-5 dark figures appeared and started circling the car. We were frozen with fear. I told the guys, “Recite prayers!” They only said “Bismillah.” I gathered myself and stepped on the gas. We fled from there so fast that we left behind the pickaxes, shovels, and camping gear; we left everything as it was.

With trembling hands and feet, we reached the main road. We composed ourselves a bit at a gas station on the way. We bought gas and headed towards Ankara. After arriving home, I wanted to rest a bit and get what happened out of my head. We didn’t see the friends for a few days. Then we contacted each other, got together, and assessed the situation. When I asked Orhan, “What does İsmail Abi say about this?” he said, “He said, ‘It’s possible; jinn can claim treasures. I should have realized, but how could I know? It never happened to me before.'” It didn’t sound convincing. I had a feeling inside, “It’s like İsmail Abi set us up.”

A few days passed, and strange things started happening at home. At night, I felt someone standing at the head of my bed; I could hear their breathing. I would jump out of bed in fear and turn on the light, but nobody was there. I started having strange dreams. Even though I tried to do things to distract myself, my mind became even more confused. I started seeing shadows in my room. I couldn’t sleep with the light off anymore. I get up to go to the toilet at night; as I walk down the corridor, noises come from the living room. I open the door asking, “Who’s there?” The shadow suddenly hides. I see it, but I can’t muster the courage to go near it. I started sleeping with the corridor light on as well. Of course, my father noticed this and got angry. “How old is this man, sleeping with the light on like a child! The electricity bill will be huge,” he complained to my mother. Because of this, I started wanting not to go home in the evenings.

I have a paralyzed uncle who has been bedridden for about 13 years. I thought I’d visit him and get away from home. After calling and finding out he was available, I went for an evening visit. Uncle asked, “Well Özkan, you finished university. What are you doing now, any job?” I replied, “I’m hustling, uncle, no permanent job, but I take day jobs.” He asked, “How are the jobs you take, do they pay well?” Since that day was always on my mind, I absentmindedly blurted out, “If we had found it, it would have paid very well…” My uncle got curious: “Found what? Did you get into treasure hunting?” While wondering how he knew about treasure, I tried to cover up, “No uncle, if we had found money…” but he didn’t believe me; it was too obvious. When he insisted, asking “Are you searching for treasure?” I explained the incident without going into detail.

My uncle said, “Son, this business is not child’s play! Why do you get into things you don’t know about? I’ve dug for a lot of treasure. Look, in the end, our health went too. If you look at the result, there’s nothing to show for it.” I was very surprised by what my uncle said. Moving to the armchair next to him, I asked, “I didn’t know you were involved in treasure hunting. Didn’t you become like this because of a brain hemorrhage?” My uncle sighed deeply and said, “No, son, what brain hemorrhage? We tell people that, but that’s not the real story.” “How did it happen then?” I asked, and he began to tell:

“A few friends and I used to search for treasure in the old days. Our intention was to get rich quick, but wherever we tried, it turned up empty. Then one day, one of the friends said he found a solid place, that we would definitely find it this time. We got excited, of course. Back then, there weren’t technological devices like today. Our work was done with Cinci Hodjas (jinn experts); we collaborated with a reliable hodja for both treasure detection and protection. We first went to the place we found with the hodja. After the hodja spoke with the jinn, he said, ‘There is a great treasure in this area.’ We said, ‘Then let’s secure it and dig, hodja.’ The hodja encircled the area with prayers. We started digging, but since the treasure was deep, we were digging horizontally, not vertically. We were progressing like digging a tunnel. Since the night digging took a long time, we rested in shifts. It didn’t finish in one day anyway; it took a few days. But as we dug, we unknowingly went outside the hodja’s circle. The hodja wasn’t going to wait for us every day, right? Sometimes he came, sometimes he didn’t. Digging and digging, at the end of the fourth day, we reached the treasure. I found a rather large pot. After cleaning around it, I fainted as soon as I grasped the pot with my hand. I opened my eyes in the hospital. My left side was paralyzed. Physical therapy and such didn’t help,” he said.

“So what happened to the treasure, uncle?” I asked. “The friends brought the hodja and took it. They gave me a small share, but it was little. When I asked, they said, ‘Not much came out.’ But it was a huge pot! How could I prove it? Besides, I was worried about my own life,” he said. Then he advised me, “Don’t you ever get involved in this business again! I fell into this state despite knowing.” I said, “No uncle, never! Treasure hunting is not for me anyway.”

It was night by then. Although I didn’t want to go, I returned home. As I walked down the corridor towards my room, I saw that the bathroom door was left open. Thinking, “I’ll brush my teeth and close the door,” I headed that way. When I reached the bathroom, inside there was an ugly thing about one and a half meters tall, misshapen, with big ears, looking at me! My heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest. I immediately turned back and headed to my room. Since I didn’t know many prayers, I just kept saying “Bismillah, Bismillah…”

This wasn’t my last encounter with that creature. In the following days, I saw it many more times. I open the toilet door, see a foot, and immediately close it. I couldn’t even use the toilet at home anymore. At night, I couldn’t sleep until the morning call to prayer sounded. Whenever I closed my eyes, it felt like someone was running around in the room. I was on the verge of going mad.

My mother had also noticed lately that I was afraid of everything. She took me aside and asked, “Son, what’s wrong? Something’s been up with you lately. You get startled by the slightest sound. You sleep with the lights on at night. Are they scaring you?” I couldn’t bear it anymore and said, “Yes, mom, they are scaring me a lot! I can’t even sleep!” My mother patted my back, saying, “Son, why didn’t you say so before? You used to get scared a lot when you were little too. I had an amulet made for you. You wore it until you were five, then it got lost. Since the fear passed, I didn’t have another one made. It seems it has started again. Let me have another one of those amulets made for you.” I couldn’t tell my mother about the treasure incident. “Who will you have it made by? Let me go get it made,” I said. My mother said, “Son, that hodja is in Kırıkkale. He doesn’t just make amulets for anyone. He’s old now, retired from that work, but your father solved a problem for him once. He likes your father; he wouldn’t refuse him. If your father calls, he’ll make one again. Just say he wants an amulet.”

Actually, I thought it would be good to meet with a hodja and explain the real situation to him. I told my mother, “You tell dad to call him. Our friend Orhan is also scared; let’s go together.” The next day, my father called and informed him we were coming. Our friends didn’t have as much trouble as I did, but they were also scared sometimes. The four of us got together again and headed to the hodja’s house.

We arrived at a detached house with a large garden in a village and knocked on the door. An uncle aged 75-80 opened the door. This must be the hodja they mentioned. When I said we came for the hodja, he said, “Come in, my son, that’s me.” When I conveyed my father’s greetings, he replied, “Welcome, children, come inside. Your father already called.” He led us to the living room, said, “Make yourselves comfortable, I’ll be right back,” and left us. After 2-3 minutes, an auntie came in with fruit juices and offered them to us. The uncle had also returned. He sat opposite us and said, “Well, what have you been up to? What’s your trouble, tell me.”

The friends spoke up: “Hodja, honestly, we just get scared at home for no reason,” they said. I took the floor and said, “Hodja, my situation is worse. They appear to me! I’m about to lose my mind!” I hadn’t told the guys, not wanting to scare them. They were surprised when they heard what I said. “What appearing, son? Who appears?” they asked. The hodja seemed to understand the situation. After nodding his head up and down, he said, “We’ll sort it out, God willing.” He stood up and took a few incense sticks from his drawer. He gave the incense to our friend Fatih and said, “Light these in those corners.” Then he took out a copper bowl and placed it on the coffee table. Turning to Mehmet, he said, “Son, tell your auntie to bring some water.” Our Mehmet dashed off, “Auntie, Hacı Amca wants water!” Two minutes later, she entered with a one-and-a-half-liter Şaşal bottle. Our Orhan, seeing the Abant brand water from BİM market, jokingly asked, “What’s up, hodja, does the branded water make the vision clearer?” trying to be funny. The hodja smiled and said, “Son, tap water is chlorinated; it doesn’t work with that. This is spring water; I fill it specially from the fountain.” Orhan had asked jokingly, but he got his answer.

After filling the bowl with water, the hodja began to read prayers and blew on the water. He started the session by asking us our mother’s and father’s names. After pausing for a bit, he asked, “Son, did you go digging for treasure?” Orhan panicked, “No hodja, what treasure?” Mehmet nudged Orhan, “Son, stop lying! It’s obvious the man sees everything like watching TV, what are you denying?” Interjecting, I said, “Yes hodja, we went to dig a treasure site in Çorum.” “Son, I understand you are ignorant, but are you out of your minds too? You went completely unprotected!” he said. “What protection, hodja?” asked our Fatih. The hodja said, “Look children, since you embarked on such a thing, you should have gone there with someone knowledgeable in havas ilm (esoteric knowledge). You should have encircled the treasure and driven away the jinn. Treasure business is not that easy. You started digging directly at a treasure claimed by jinn.”

“So hodja, are they haunting us?” I asked. The hodja said, “There are no entities with you right now. The three of you were only touched, but Özkan, you are not as lucky as them. Özkan my son, these things have claimed your house! These entities don’t claim just like that. Didn’t they make themselves known to you? Didn’t they warn you with something?” After thinking for a bit, I said, “Honestly hodja, I had a dream while digging for treasure. They told me, ‘This place is ours; if you don’t leave, your house will become ours too.’ I didn’t pay much attention, thinking it was just a dream.” The hodja said, “Özkan, let me explain it to you this way: Your letaif (subtle energy centers) are more open compared to your friends. They only give fear to them in their sleep, but they can appear to you even when you’re awake.” “Hodja, excuse me, but what are letaif?” I asked. The hodja said, “Never mind now; it takes a long time to explain. Let’s focus on our task.”

He wrote things down for my friends and gave each an amulet. As I waited, wondering if he wouldn’t write one for me, he said, “Özkan my son, your problem is significant. I will write something for you too, but this alone is not enough.” “What else is needed, hodja?” I asked. “Do you perform salat (prayer)?” he asked. A bit ashamed, I said, “Honestly hodja, I’ve been to Friday prayers once or twice, but that’s it.” “Okay, do you know the prayer surahs (chapters)?” he asked. I lowered my head and said, “I don’t know, hodja.”

“Özkan, now I will write an amulet for you too. I will also give you something for your house. You will follow these instructions for one month. During this time, you will learn the prayer surahs and start praying. You must not leave that house without worship. You must definitely perform tasbihat (post-prayer dhikr). Don’t forget Ayetel Kürsi in the tasbihat. When going to bed, you will recite the prayers Felak, Nas, Ayetel Kürsi. In fact, if you draw a circle around your bed while reciting Ayetel Kürsi before sleeping, God willing, they cannot approach you. You didn’t get the treasure anyway; they just scared you.”

“May Allah be pleased with you, hodja, I will do whatever you say,” I said. The hodja wrote what he needed to write and gave a few recipes made with herbs. “Give my regards to your father. Now, get well soon. Don’t tell anyone else, don’t bring shame upon yourselves or me,” he said and saw us off.

As soon as I returned to Ankara, I followed the hodja’s instructions. I memorized the surahs and started praying. As I read the surahs and performed the prayers, I began to feel relief. Especially when I recited Ayetel Kürsi, Felak, and Nas before sleeping, I slept like a baby. The noises inside the house stopped, and the apparitions ceased. I only felt something in my room, but it couldn’t approach me. It was as if it was waiting at the doorway, unable to enter. My self-confidence had significantly returned.

May Allah be pleased with our hodja. After three months, nothing was left with me. I went to visit the hodja. “My child, do not abandon your prayers. What protects you, by Allah’s permission, is the Quran you read and your prayers,” he said. “I am aware, hodja, may Allah be pleased with you,” I said. Thank God, I was saved from such a calamity in this way.",1,1743668485.0,ParanormalHorror,0,1.0,False

1jqcy1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1jqcy1l/what_are_the_benefits_of_lulutox_tea/,What are the benefits of Lulutox tea?,"I’ve been seeing **Lulutox tea** pop up more and more lately—on TikTok, in Reddit threads, even in casual convos with coworkers. People seem to be raving about it for everything from **bloating and weight loss to energy and digestion**. I wasn’t sold at first, but curiosity got the better of me. After using **Lulutox detox tea** consistently for a little over six weeks, I figured I’d share what I experienced and break down the potential benefits (and downsides) from someone who actually drank it daily.

So if you're looking for a **Lulutox tea review** that doesn't sound like it came straight from a sales page, here you go.

**Why I Decided to Try Lulutox Detox Tea**

I’ve struggled with sluggish digestion, low energy, and bloating for what feels like forever. I’m relatively active and eat clean most of the time, but my gut always seemed off, especially after heavier meals. I wasn’t expecting any miracle transformation, but if **Lulutox detox tea** could help me feel even slightly better, I figured it was worth a try.

What initially caught my attention was the ingredient list. I’d already heard about things like **Matcha Green Tea** and **Yerba Mate** for boosting metabolism and supporting digestion, and this tea combined those with others like **Sencha**, **Dandelion Leaf**, **Oolong Tea**, **Ginseng**, and **Milk Thistle**.

**Breaking Down the Lulutox Tea Ingredients**

I was honestly surprised at how solid the formula looked. It's not just some weak green tea blend. Here’s what stood out to me:

* **Matcha & Oolong Tea**: Known to support **calorie burning** and give clean energy without the jitters.
* **Dandelion Leaf & Milk Thistle**: Historically used for **liver support** and helping with detoxification.
* **Goji Berries & Lemongrass**: Included for their antioxidant properties and soothing effects on the stomach.
* **Ginseng & Yerba Mate**: For **mental clarity and sustained energy**, without the crash you get from coffee.

It’s also **vegan, gluten-free, soy-free**, and doesn't contain added sugar. Big plus.

**How I Used It**

I followed the basic instructions: steeped one tea bag in hot water for about 5 minutes and drank it either in the morning or early afternoon. Some days I had a second cup, usually iced. The taste is **surprisingly smooth with a light peach flavor**—not overly sweet, not too herbal.

**The Benefits I Noticed Over Six Weeks**

**1. Major bloating relief**  
Probably the most immediate difference I noticed was less bloating. Normally by evening, my stomach feels like a balloon—especially after lunch. By the end of week one, I already felt lighter. It wasn’t just visual, either. My clothes actually fit better around the waist.

**2. Better energy without coffee dependency**  
I didn’t completely quit coffee, but I went from three cups a day down to one, thanks to the subtle but steady energy I got from **Lulutox tea**. It’s not jittery like caffeine pills or espresso, but more like a clean, calm focus.

**3. Regular digestion**  
This was unexpected, but definitely appreciated. My digestion felt a lot more regular, without being overly stimulated like with other ""detox"" teas that act more like laxatives. I never felt crampy or rushed to the bathroom.

**4. Mild but consistent weight drop**  
I didn’t start this as a weight loss solution, but I did lose about five pounds over the six weeks. I was also walking daily and eating pretty well, but I do think **Lulutox detox tea** helped keep cravings down and made me feel fuller between meals.

**Any Side Effects?**

Not really. If you’re wondering about **Lulutox tea side effects**, the only thing I’d note is that I needed to drink more water while using it. I had one day where I felt a bit dehydrated because I wasn’t compensating for the extra fluid output. Also, if you're sensitive to caffeine—even in smaller doses—maybe start with just one cup per day.

**So… Does Lulutox Detox Tea Work?**

For me, **yes—but in a gradual, supportive way**. It’s not a quick-fix solution or some overnight fat burner. It seems to help your body do what it’s supposed to do more efficiently. It’s helped me reduce bloating, gain energy, and feel more balanced overall.

If you're searching for **lulutox detox tea does it work**, my experience says yes—**but only if you pair it with decent habits.**

**Where to Buy Lulutox Tea**

If you're curious and looking for **Lulutox tea where to buy**, don’t get it from sketchy third-party sites. The [**official website**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) is where I ordered mine, and they had a solid discount running.

Here’s the second link I saved for convenience too:

**Final Thoughts**

If you’re someone dealing with daily bloating, sluggish digestion, or energy dips—and you’re into natural remedies—**Lulutox detox tea** might be worth a shot. It’s not a magic pill, but it gave me enough of a positive experience that I’ll keep drinking it as part of my daily routine.

Would love to hear from others who've tried it. What was your **Lulutox tea review** like? Did you experience any changes or **Lulutox detox tea side effects**?",1,1743668469.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

1jqcwxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jqcwxt/its_been_about_3_years_now/,It’s been about 3 years now,"My oldest son (now 27) suddenly stopped communicating with me just before he moved into my older sister’s home. (He was living in his own prior to this). No idea as to why. And out of respect, I never pushed my older sister’s to find out why and tell me. My younger son (24) lives with me. 

One day my youngest tells me he’s going out for coffee with my older sister. This is not unusual. When he comes back, he tells me that, unknowingly, his aunt picked him up to take him to the airport so that he could say goodbye to his brother. That’s when I found out that my oldest son was moving to California!!! My older sister knew this and kept it from me because, according to her, it was not her responsibility to tell me. 

I lost it!! I mass texted the entire family that they could all go to hell and that there was no way that my older sister was the only one who knew about this move. 

We’ve always been a pretty close family (myself 58, older sister 70, younger sister 56, plus each of us has 2 kids). Every holiday we had a family gathering. Any special occasion was a family event. Now, they do their thing, I do mine. And I have never told my youngest that he couldn’t participate with the rest of the family. 

My youngest does communicate occasionally with my oldest via Discord as he doesn’t have his latest phone number. So this is the only way I know that my oldest is alive. 

Friends tell me that any one of my family who knew of my son’s plans should have told me and I agree. I should have been given a heads up. I would have been better prepared and would still have a relationship with the rest of my family. I know that I wouldn’t have tried to get him to change his mind. This was his decision and he’s an adult. 

I did try once to meet with my older sister to discuss this and hopefully end this rift. We met in a restaurant and the first thing she said was that it wasn’t her responsibility to tell me. No apology. No refection. I walked out and haven’t talked to her since. That was  early 2024. ",0,1743668341.0,AITAH,16,0.25,False

Will we feel it though?, because major things we export to US is tea maybe coffee. I think our major markets are the European countries. Of corse the impact will be there but maybe mild. 

This is not my major issue though. The one that I felt personally was the stoppage of USAID. I'm still in school and my primary provider( A single mother) used to work on a program in usaid before it stopped. After the trumps order with the help of Musk there were massive layoffs almost 85% of the projects worldwide stopped. 

Now I'm having a hard time in school since that (my mother's salary which was not even enough) was the only thing keeping me (us) and my siblings alive. Right now I barely have a meal a day just because of a signature signed by someone in oval office in a country I have never stepped in let alone see it.Rent arrears are killing me, no food , no gas no nothing. I'm thinking of differing and look for a hustle to sustain me and save some to complete my studies in future. I know most people are affected.

This shows the kind of power America has. I understand there doing it for their own good , but jizzz we (I) are feeling it.

Dating at 41 feels a bit daunting, and I’d love some insight from those who are out there meeting people.  

I'm not really into the typical bar/club scene, but I’d love to know where women in their 30s-40s like to hang out—whether it’s coffee shops, hobby groups, social events, or something else. What’s been your experience? Where would you go if you were looking to meet someone organically?  

Any advice is appreciated! ",4,1743668018.0,AskWomenOver30,11,0.75,False
