1jyozuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1jyozuc/hospice_thank_you_baskets/,Hospice thank you baskets.,"Hello, 
I’m writing to see what/ if any of the hospice nurses in here(or other nurses) have gotten thank you baskets from their patients family members. 

My grandmother is terminal and i would like to get some ideas for a care basket for their hard work taking care of my grandmother and her family while she is at the end. 

I assume things like: pens, notebooks, chocolate(or other various candies), coffee. Are ALWAYS welcomed. 

Thank you so much,

1jyoxps,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyoxps,How to rearrange/increase space in this area? 🙃,"We did have the small wooden shelf (on top of the microwave) on the wall like in the third pic, and that’s where we kept the coffee and some nice teas.
Command strips, no matter how many, aren’t holding anymore—the wall isn’t painted, it’s a weird plastic-y wallpaper thing that’s textured and they just won’t stay stuck to it. The house is very dated. 
I’m nervous to drill anything in even though we technically can, just don’t wanna cause any potential issues when we move out.

The kitchen isn’t very big and there’s not any extra storage, and the baking stuff/bulk reserves food (pasta etc) is in this wooden cabinet. 

Having the coffee right above the coffee maker is so nice! There’s no space in any of our other cabinets and we also like the way the glass jars look on display…

Anyway! Do y’all have any ideas for how we can improve space efficiency in this area? The appliances don’t fit anywhere else sadly. Next place is gonna have a bigger kitchen but that’s about 1.5-2 yrs away so might as well make this nice in the meantime.

It was the sweetest thing ever and the next morning how you made my coffee so perfect and I never once told you how I liked it. No one ever did that for me before you.

Back to the cuddles... I really miss how we would get in bed and then end up talking for hours with our bodies intertwined, you were so perfectly comfortable wrapped up with me. Kissing your cheek over and over and those perfect lips, running my fingers tips through your sexy short beard.  I haven't slept the same in six months. Can we just make up so we can cuddle and I can finally crawl into bed with you and fall asleep in your arms again.  Listen to your heartbeat, listen to our breathing fall into harmony. I remember when I fell asleep on you for the first time. Did you know that's when you finally had me wrapped around your finger? When I felt safe enough to pass out on you haha. I miss how safe you made me feel, like nothing could ever get to me as long as I was there with you, all wrapped up in you.

And as far as I could tell, she didn't have any romantic feelings for me. 

A year later, we see each other in NYC again for the same event. Now up until this point we had been periodically keeping in touch over text. She even sent me a picture of herself in Venice, to which I said she looked beautiful. 

But it's a year later and we're back in NYC. I text her to make plans to hangout and I tell her I want to take her to a speakeasy and get drinks, because she's finally able to drink in the states legally. 

It goes really well. We talk about the future, she tells me she got into Oxford and all these UK schools for her masters, I tell her I can't wait to visit her there, etc etc. I walk her back to her hotel and we say our goodbyes because at this point, we are both about to be graduated. And who knows when we'll be in the same city again. We hug and I tell her that I think she's really awesome, and that we'll keep in touch. 

And that's the last I see of her. Now at this point I've been really careful not to be direct in telling her how much I like her romantically. I've made it fairly obvious indirectly however and I wager that she knows I like her in that way.

But because we are separated by such long distance, telling her how I really felt would just make our situation so much worse. Because it's not like I can take her out on dates and we can actually explore the possibility of a relationship.

If our relationship is going to be purely over periodic texts and voice notes, it's better that we just remain friends, right? 

And again, I really really like this girl. But it seems to me that the only way we could actually have a relationship, is if either one of us coincidentally started living in the same 50 mile radius.

I’ve recently just got of a very toxic and abusive relationship and I really want to surround myself with good and positive energy. Friends that are real, and not flaky. It would be amazing to connect with somebody who is kind, enjoys music, is a foodie, and loves animals and also, can carry on a conversation. I’d like to describe myself as a very chill and kind person. I’m drug free, I don’t care for bars or drinking, definitely not one to follow the crowd. I just really appreciate a happy and healthy connection with a good friend. I also love a good laugh and to be goofy. Laughing a lot, is important to me. :) Doesn’t matter the sex. Do people like this still exist? Are you out there? If you’re on the west coast, that would be a big plus and if not, that’s okay too :)

Also, I’m stuck in the 90s, adore coffee, good dance music, and anything and everything to do with British culture, music, movies, you name it!

1jyoqnc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyoqnc,Filling is BRIGHT yellow??,"So I've been getting fillings over the past three months (had a period of bad illness a few years ago, and dental hygiene fell off for a while unfortunately). One of the ones that I got about a month ago has turned really bright yellow. Not just yellowing, like a corn yellow. 
None of the other fillings have done this! The other ones that I got in that same session are kinda visible in the photos, and they're a normal colour. The ones that I got on the other side of my mouth two months ago are also completely normal. It's just this one! 

What's going on? Should I be concerned?

I'm a medical cannabis patient, and I smoke once a day. I have coffee maybe once or twice a week, tea even less often, and I don't drink red wine.

You can match with a whole friend group or just one-on-one, depending on what you’re looking for — but the emphasis is on group connection.
It shows a map of people or events nearby, and if you’re up for it, it can even suggest random activities or adventures based on your area (or you can turn that off if spontaneity stresses you out).
You can create or join group activities — game nights, quiet coffee meetups, day trips, barbecues, etc.
No mandatory selfies, but optional if you want them.
Built-in verification to avoid creepy stuff.
You can skip small talk prompts entirely, or use them if they help.
A “Warm-Up Mode” helps ease into messaging with conversation starters and low-pressure suggestions for replies.
A “I’m nervous today” button tailors your experience when you're feeling socially drained or anxious.

There could even be a gamified system where you earn XP for social wins like saying hi, joining an event, or messaging someone. There could even be “boss fights” you earn experiences and clothes for your avatar and achievements and such by going out of your comfort zone.
Maybe even a chill social feed where people post what they’re doing through the app — no likes, no follower counts, just sharing your experience.
I know it sounds like a lot, but I’ve been curious about building something that puts neurodivergent and socially anxious people first — not an afterthought.

Is this actually a good idea? Would anyone want it?

We work together at a local coffee shop. I’ve found out recently she is into girls AHH. I had a feeling that she was but I didn’t know enough about her to confirm.

We tease each other A LOT. I never interact with other girls nor does she really talk to other girls at work like we talk and interact. It feels like very flirty banter. Anytime we walk by each other during our shift, we have to look at each other with like a face that’s meant to tease the other person. “Wow you are in my way” “Slacking off, I see?”. It’s that kind of interaction you have with someone you like but you’ll “make fun of them” or make silly jokes about each other. At least, it is what it feels like. She looks at me up and down often with that kind of sass we give each other. We smile and joke awkwardly and silently without saying anything whilst walking by each other during a busy day. She’ll sometimes try to include me in a funny conversations farther away from me, ask me questions with a big and sorta blushy shy smile on her face. 

My friend almost ratted me out to her that I had a little crush and she got very curious about who liked her (she said she thought she 100% knew who it was) I’m very curious to know if she knows it’s me. I can’t tell if she likes me omfg. I don’t know what to dooo.

1jyomxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigHomeProContractors/comments/1jyomxx/7_ways_ants_impact_agricultural_crops_for_better/,7 Ways Ants Impact Agricultural Crops for Better Yields,"Ants might seem like a nuisance, but they actually play a huge role in boosting agricultural productivity. Here are 7 Ways Ants Impact Agricultural Crops for Better Yields.



Number 1: Soil Conditioning

Ants are like tiny gardeners. They create tunnels as they dig, improving soil aeration and water infiltration, which helps plant roots access moisture and nutrients more easily.



Number 2: Nutrient Distribution

As ants forage, they gather organic matter and break it down, redistributing nutrients back into the soil. This process enriches the soil, promoting healthier plants and better crop yields.



Number 3: Biological Pest Management

Ants naturally control pest populations by preying on harmful insects like aphids. By attracting more ants to your farm, you can reduce the need for chemical pesticides while keeping crops safe from pests.



Number 4: Disease Reduction

Some ant species have antimicrobial properties that can lower the incidence of plant diseases. By fostering an ant-friendly environment, you can improve plant health and reduce crop losses due to diseases.



Number 5: Enhanced Biodiversity

Incorporating ants into your farming system boosts biodiversity, which is key for sustainable agriculture. They help maintain ecological balance by controlling pests and supporting beneficial insect populations.



Number 6: Increased Yield in Shaded Crops

Ants thrive in shaded crop systems, like coffee or cacao farms, where they help minimize damage from pests. The cooler microclimate allows ants to be more effective in their roles, leading to healthier crops and higher yields.



Number 7: Economic Benefits

Utilizing ants for pest control can save you money on pesticides and labor costs. With fewer chemicals needed, not only do you cut expenses, but you also support a healthier environment on your farm.

1jyomv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1jyomv4/i_feel_stuck_and_unable_to_have_a_real_career/,I feel stuck and unable to have a real career. Really need help with my nervous system,"Some background: I am a 30 y/o F went through a big trauma losing someone close in my final year of university (7 years ago). Had a breakdown 6 months later (nightly panic attacks, major physical anxiety symptoms) and started therapy which helped manage. However, it changed me entirely, I am now very highly strung and my nervous system has never quite regulated itself like it did before. The panic attacks have gone and I can handle daily life much better now however the anxiety has manifested itself very specifically into work related anxiety.

My nervous system fight or flight kicks in during meetings when I know I have to speak or when I am interviewing (anything along those lines- it's the build up and anticipation making it so awful for me) if I am just called upon suddenly I am fine. I am a confident outgoing very social person but I cannot describe the level of severity in the moment it's really bad to the point l've had to walk out of meetings feigning a phone call or personal emergency. It's honestly unbearable for me.

I have done CBT, hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, body work and breath work in the past but have never tackled this specific issue fully or properly.
I have tried cold showers, quit drinking coffee and exercise a lot more now to manage on a smaller scale but no matter how many meetings I sit through the severity persists. I've even left a job because I couldn't handle the amount of meetings we had as it was affecting my mental health so badly even though I was more than capable for the work itself. Would rather not take daily medication as it does not affect me every single day to this extent but open to anything at this point.

Im at a point where I am trying really hard to get on with it but not sure how to tackle this as it's so specific and everything l've tried so far has failed.
It's stopping me from pursuing the career and job that I want and I just really need some practical advice or tips. I am not currently in therapy but open to going back and not on any medication (would like to avoid if possible) and open to going back and have just moved to a new city.

I should also mention it's possible i have ADHD or some form of ADD as pointed out to me by a prior therapist and nurse separately that can contribute to maskina as anxietv incase that is relevant.

TLDR: struggling with work performance anxiety after trauma. Can't regulate nervous system looking for advice. Not currently in therapy ok taking medication.",2,1744598400.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

Today, after working my 6th day in a row, (as I do every week) I dropped my dinner on my carpet by accident. It was chili, and a can of coke. In that moment I absolutely did not want to exist. It was like the final straw (camels back?) 

I have these cycles. I get lonely, then I get depressed. Then I resort to unhealthy ways of coping with my emotions like drinking alcohol. I’m an alcoholic. It ALWAYS ends up worse for me when I relapse. But it’s all I know. I’ve been to treatment countless times. I’m not sure where else to turn. All I do is work but I’m constantly broke and having anxiety over bills.

I wish there was a website to apply to work for the Mexican cartel. Like I feel that might be my only option in life so I don’t feel like a depressed slave. Smh. I earn anywhere from 26/hr-35/hr depending on job, and more than 50 hours a week. Why is it so hard to even pay rent?! (Which is only $900/month, but the place is abysmal, like 100sq/ft max) I’m not eating avocado toast daily for breakfast and make my coffee at home. Idk wtf else to do. I was never good with money, but also never received any sorta guide on how to budget.

Please. Just tell me I’m right in wanting to just straight up send it. Or recommend a country to move to, or a career you think I can pursue. I’m in the US, and feel like I am living in Zimbabwe or something..",1,1744598205.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

I have been feeling a bit odd lately. You see, sometimes I feel a odd sense of pleasure when unfortunate things happen to me. I honestly think this stems from the fact that my parents never clearly sympathized with me. Whenever I'd try and share something that would bother me I'd be put down, ridiculed, made fun of, or be told that I'm overreacting. I guess that's why I enjoy situations where it can gain sympathy from others. I don't understand it though. For example, the other day I didn't know my church youth club was going to a coffee shop for bible study so I didn't bring any money. Everyone else did and my youth pastor and his wife were nice and bought me a drink. Even though I was thankful for some reason I wished that they never bought me anything. Also in a way I like to be left out by my friends, like it feels bad but for some reason it feels good.

there’s a possibility this fic is gone cause it’s been YEARS but I was going down memory lane and remembered a homestuck fic I wanted to revisit for giggles. I tried searching for it but no dice so I wanted to see if anyone else knew of it.

this was posted originally on deviantart and it had an intro/prologue post and then you could choose a character and read their story. 

so in the intro of the fic, I think it’s a bunch of the male characters and the plot idea is how they met their significant others. the fic then branches off into each one of their stories. 

I remember there was a john one where the reader was his neighbor. another was a karkat one where the reader works in a coffee shop and I think also a college au. it’s a modern setting on earth where trolls were still new to earth. that’s all I can remember :,)

if I had to guess timeline, it would be when I was a young teen so between 2013 and 2015 are my guesses. thanks in advance y’all!",2,1744597944.0,homestuck,0,1.0,False

I will release another portion of my first story each week. I have written out species specific with the assistance of ai. It has help me work out details and keep me true to the world I made.
I find most scifi stories focus on a human male. In beyond the Veil I hopefully brought many genres together. Scifi, erotica, and horror. 









BEYOND THE VEIL

1. THE FIRST CROSSING

Nyx-7 Research Station 
The central control center smelled of ozone and stale coffee. The curved monitors in the stretched floor to ceiling, revealing the inky blackness of space torn by a shimmering golden scar—the Veil. It pulsed like a living thing, casting liquid light across the faces of the assembled scientists.
Two distinct groups stood apart
The Terrans wore form-fitting gray uniforms with hexagonal insignias on their shoulders. Their skin ran the gamut from pale ivory to deep umber, their eyes squinting at screens filled with scrolling data. They moved with the clipped efficiency of military personnel, though their fingers trembled slightly as they worked.
The Qhelxians were nightmares of evolutionary elegance—tall, draconic humanoids with obsidian scales that drank in the light. Their elongated muzzles varied: some bore rows of needle-teeth behind lipless mouths, others had smooth, beak-like jaws. They wore layered armor reminiscent of ancient samurai, the lacquered plates breathing with biotech filaments that pulsed like veins
On the main display screen, the Terran research vessel Eidolon glided toward the anomaly. Its sleek, gunmetal-gray hull bristled with sensor arrays and dish antennae, giving it the appearance of some deep-sea creature evolved to navigate unseen pressures.  
“Threshold in thirty seconds,” announced a Terran woman with close-cropped black hair. Her nametag read Hansen.
One of the reptilian scientists made a chittering noise, its clawed fingers flying across a holographic interface. The Terran beside it—a young man with dark circles under his eyes—translated: “The Qhelxian science team is registering minor quantum fluctuations from the Veil’s surface.” 
No one breathed.  
Inside the Eidolon
The ship’s corridors were all sharp angles and pale blue lighting. Warning stripes marked the floors, leading to the reinforced observation blister at the bow. The air smelled of antiseptic and the faint electric tang of overworked machinery.  
Captain Elias Ryland gripped a handrail, his stocky frame blocking the main console. His salt-and-pepper beard twitched as he scowled. “Get her out of here,” he barked
Two crewmen in gray jumpsuits struggled with a thrashing blue figure. She stood nearly seven feet tall, long black hair, her skin the color of deep ocean water, glowing traces of veins visible beneath its surface. Her face was terran like, with luminous blue eyes that burned with panic.
“You don’t understand!” The alien’s voice was melodic but raw with terror. “They see everything that crosses! They’ll take you!”  
The blue woman lashed out, her elongated fingers ending in delicate claws. “Fools! You think this is exploration? This is trespass!” 
“move, get her out of here!” he commanded his men 
On the main viewer, the Veil filled the screen. Golden light pulsed through the observation blister, casting everyone’s shadow in sharp relief against the walls
Contact.
The Eidolon pierced the surface. 
Like a ripple in a magical gold mirror. There was no sound. No shockwave.  
Just silence.
Nyx-7 – control center
The monitors erupted in chaos. Information flodding the system. The data dissolved into static.
“Sensors overloading!” someone yelled.  Then—  
-everything went dark.
The station’s emergency lights flared to life—strobing red, casting the observation deck in jagged, hellish flashes. The screens crackled back to life as the Eidolon finished passing into the veil.
Three heart beats later.
The Veil went dark. It rippled as a tendril of smoke, darker than the surrounding blackness, peeled away from the Veil. It moved wrong—not drifting like gas would in zero-G, but with purpose, with hunger. 
It reached the bioship first—an organic-looking vessel covered in spiraling silver script that hurt the eyes to focus on. The smoke passed through its hull like water through a sieve.
The bioship convulsed. Its fleshy outer layer blackened, shriveled, then burst outward in a cloud of frozen viscera.  
The shadow kept coming.  

Toward the station. 
Panic set in on all the stations ocupants. Running for the nearest escape pod or transport that would never launch.
”Gods below—“ a Qhelxian researcher choked out.   
The shadow swelled.  
Two red eyes ignited in its depths.  
Then—hands. Long, clawed, forming from the smoke, reaching. 
Impact 
The wraith slammed into Nyx-7. The entire structure shuddered. Metal screamed as four molten gashes tore across the hull.  
Then—  
The wraith melted, dissolving into the station’s own shadows. 
The sound hit first.  
A screeching whisper, slithering through the walls. The Qhelxians collapsed, hands clamped over their ears, black blood trickling from their nostrils and eyes. The Terrans ran, some screaming, others frozen in place.  
A shadow swelled on the bulkhead.  
Eyes opened.  
Hands clawed free of the walls shadow, smoke-solidifying into talons.  
The first crewman died mid-scream, his body yanked into the wall.
Others were struck down with scalding claws of rage..
A Qhelxian resercher crouched in a corner, his beak cracked, black blood oozing down his chestplate. His biotech armor was peeling away in ribbons, trying to escape his body. The recording was shaky, the image distorted. His face was half-shadowed, his left eye burst, weeping black fluid.  
”The shadow moves,” he rasped. ”It’s in the walls. It’s alive. It took them. The Eidolon. It took them. It’s here for us. The blue one...”  
A noise—scraping metal.  
His remaining eye flicked to something off-screen.  
”The red eyes—“   
Behind him, the bulkhead breathed.
Then, a whisper, barely audible:  
”They’re in the walls. They don’t need doors. They don’t need air. They just…”  
The feed died.  
Outside the station
Silence
Metal and bio debree floating freely. The station, a glimor of light flickered through its windows. Sparrks pulsing from its wounds. 
The Veil hung placid once more, its golden surface undisturbed.  Not yet at its original brightness.   
Then—   
With a ripple like disturbed mercury, the Eidolon slid back into normal space. Its running lights flickered weakly. No signs of life. No distress calls sounded.  
Inside, the ship was empty. 
No crew. No bodies.  
Just the quiet hum of reactivating systems.  
”Auto-recall initiated,” the AI intoned. ”Destination: Terra. Estimated arrival: Fifteen years.”  
The engines flared.  
The ship vanished.  
Inside the Eidolon.
A cryopod, its display counting down.  
Inside, glowing blue eyes flickered.

He buys me random gifts when he thinks of me. He brushes my hair when I’m too sick.

The reviews are kind of vague and not very helpful lol, but I love reading these kinds of posts so maybe some of you will too.
My favourite notes are iris, violet, fig, vanilla, caramel, honey, cherry and cacao, which is why my collection is mostly made up of sweet scents. I am 38/F and have always loved gourmands! 

I've given them all a rating between 1 and 5 -
5 - LOVE it, would repurchase
4 - love it but don't NEED it
3 - like it but am happy to slowly use it up
2 - don't mind it but I'm keen to get it out of my collection so will use up /sell/give away asap
1 - do not like it, sell or donate asap

 This has made me realise that I'm far less picky than what I thought I was haha, although I'm pretty good with only buying scents that I love! I am not a collector in any way though, as I do use all of my perfumes.

**Burberry - Goddess Intense**: melted cough lollies doused in honey and dry lavender sprigs  

**Carolina Herrera - Good Girl Supreme**: dark forest berry chocolate cake 

**Chloé - Chloé EDP Lumineuse**: buttery vanilla and powdery florals, it's an easy, pretty scent  

**Chloé - Orchidée de Minuit**: I can't really pick out any notes and I genuinely don't know how to describe this besides vintagey vanilla-amber?
  
**Chloé - Violette**: bright, airy violet with lots of crisp greenness 
**Dior Poison Girl EDP**: lemony almonds with a hint of rose and powdery vanilla

**Givenchy - Ange Ou Demon Le Secret**: sweet cranberry iced tea with slices of lemon 

**Glossier - You Fleur**: iris followed by warm cashmere, dry down is warm, salty skin after a day at the beach 

**Gucci - Gorgeous Orchid**: green banana scent mixed with vanilla, it smells v similar to my beloved Chloe Planifolia!

**Guerlain - Tobacco Honey**: insanely strong and thick honey scent mixed with spicy tobacco, can only be used in cold weather and even then only 1 spray is enough 

**JPG - Scandal Absolu**: creamy tuberose with honeyed figs and a warm nuttiness. Super strong on me so I can only do 1 spray!  

**Kayali - Vanilla Royale Sugared Patchouli**: patchouli comes out really strong at first, but 10 minutes later it's thick crème brulee that is slightly burnt yet super sweet 

**Kayali - Wedding Velvet Santal**: soft, powdery amber and milky sandalwood with faint tea in the background  

**Miller Harris - Violet Ida**: carroty, powdery iris in an expensive, soft leather handbag  

**MMM - Matcha Meditation**: strong, hot matcha tea made with a shot of white chocolate  

**Paco Rabanne - Fame Couture**: powdery iris slowly taken over by a smoky vanilla. Smells nothing like original Fame to me, it's much better 
  
**Prada - Candy Night**: powdery cacao scent, not chocolate but dry dusty cacao  

**Sabrina Carpenter - Sweet Tooth**: sweet marshmallow fluff in the opening, drydown is soft musk  

**Sabrina Carpenter - Sweet Tooth Caramel Dream**: melted white chocolate block with caramel drizzled over it 

**Valentino - Pink PP**: sweet orange blossom mixed with melted marshmallows, such a pretty girl scent  

**Viktor&Rolf - Flowerbomb**: feminine florals with a dusting of icing sugar on top 

**Viktor&Rolf - Flowerbomb Tiger Lily**: creamy mango with tropical coconut, very nice but also very strong - I feel like this is suited well to late spring or early summer  

**Xerjoff - Bouquet Ideale**: this somehow has no fruit listed but I get warm, dark berry compote or even mulled wine with cinnamon sticks in it 

**Xerjoff - Gran Ballo**: caramel and vanilla coated gardenia, it smells like a prettier, more grown up version of VLJ 

**YSL - Black Opium Le Parfum**: rich, deep, dark vanilla coffee, it's very well blended!  

**2/5**  
**Ariana Grande - Ari**: sticky raspberry-marshmallow popsicle  

**Ariana Grande - Sweet Like Candy:**  juicy blackberries dusted with powdered sugar 

**Bond No 9 - Madison Square Park**: fake blueberry scent sprayed onto real grass. Nice but also smells very 'thin', it's more like cheap scent from the dollar store 

**Byron Parfums - Mula Mula**: thick caramel mixed with syrupy fruits, beautiful scent but sadly lasts less than half hour on my skin 

**Cacharel - Yes I Am Fabulous**: milky, sugary blackberry tea with some ginger stirred in  

**Carolina Herrera - Good Girl Sparkling Ice**: grown-up, sweet cocoa scent with masculine tonka in the dry down

**Coreterno - Mystic Sugar**: chocolate-covered baked pineapple, very thick and decadent but drydown is a touch too masculine

**Dior - Blooming Bouquet**: peony and sweet pea mixed together in a a very 'pretty girl' scent  

**ELDO - Sous Le Pont Mirabeau**: aquatic and green in a briny seaweed type of way

**Hermès - Un Jardin Sur Le Toit**: freshly cut grass is scattered around your picnic blanket that has apple slices and bunches of roses sitting on it

**Juicy Couture - Viva La Juicy Gold**: very sweet fake-caramel scent, I used to adore this a few years ago but now it's very cloying  

**Kayali - Capri in a Bottle Lemon Sugar**: sweet lemon coated in sugar with the standard kayali DNA. The size of these vacay bottles really bug me, if it was a 50ml bottle I'd repurchase 

**Kayali - Maldives in a Bottle Ylang Coco**: aromatic rosemary and creamy coconut with a hint of ylang, nice but nothing overly special**

**Kayali - Maui in a Bottle Sweet Banana**: strong jasmine with some coconut and the tiniest hints of banana in the drydown 

**Kayali - Utopia Vanilla Coco 21**: very elegant floral-tropical scent, makes me think of a boujee lady wearing heels and loads of jewellery by the hotel pool  

**Kayali - Wedding Silk Santal**: peachy, bubbly scent that dries down into musk. I don't love it but somehow it's very addictive 

**Lancôme - La Vie Est Belle Iris Absolu**: initial spray is beautiful thick iris, but the drydown is your standard LVEB scent   

**Lancôme - La Vie Est Belle Soleil Cristal**: powdery floral and dry coconut, very sweet and long lasting 

**Lush - Barbie:** smells like Snow Fairy shower gel poured into a bathtub that has at least 10 Lush bath bombs already dissolving in the tub

**YSL - Black Opium Neon**: a cup of very sweet coffee with dragonfruit as the garnish
 
**1/5**

**Guerlain - Pera Granita**: zingy grapefruit and lemon, very musky after 15 minutes  

**Hermès - Un Jardin à Cythère**: dry pistachio and citrus scent, it makes me think of hot summer days  

**Kayali - Oudgasm Vanilla Oud**: vintagey vanilla with a hint of oud sprayed all over clean nappies (or diapers for US)  

**Kayali - Sweet Diamond Pink Pepper**: perfect jammy rose opening, then the drydown is full of saffron and too much oud 

**MAC Turquatic**: basic 'blue' scent, I purchased this while on holidays in the US as it's not available in Australia but unfortunately I find it very boring and basic

**Mugler - Angel**: sweet praline overshadowed by patchouli with a hint of sweaty armpit  

**Sabrina Carpenter - Sweet Tooth Cherry Baby**: cherry candy, almost has a hint of wine in it. Its nice but I have other cherry scents I much prefer 

**Viktor&Rolf - Flowerbomb Ruby Orchid**: sweet, syrupy red scent, it's a mix between OG Flowerbomb and Nectar, yet Ruby Orchid is my least favourite 

**Zara - Supreme Vanilla**: literally makes me think of a puddle of thick black ink with vanilla essence mixed in, I've never smelled anything like this before",4,1744597817.0,fragrance,2,0.83,False

Now, it’s somehow a daily occurrence that someone compliments my appearance. My daily coffee gets comped by the cashiers at the very least once a week.

Go to close out my tab and lo and behold someone I didn’t even say a word to, had covered the entire thing. 
     
Long story short, it’s mind boggling how differently you’re treated and regarded. I understand confidence and styling has some impact but this is just kind of wild to me. It feels like a social experiment in some weird way. Just be ready for some wild social changes to occur if and when you lose a significant amount of weight.

Became friends with this guy through work. Didnt know him super long but we got close, he was getting evicted and already had another place lined up but couldnt move for a few weeks. 

It started out as 3 weeks but then became 4. Whatever no problem. I helped him load and unload his entire one bedroom apartment into our house and up to our guest room. I made it very clear that my partner and I didnt like the idea of roommates bc we are very specific about our routines and the cleanliness of our home and that it was really important that things stayed the way we had them (aka, we dont mind sharing common spaces but keep your stuff clean to the point we dont know that youre living here). He was agreeable and so thankful to the point of tears, we were happy to be able to help him out. 

Well, I had to ask him multiple times to rinse his dishes as we dont want bugs, to put his teabags in the trash when hes done drinking his tea, to put his dishes in the dishwasher if the sign said dirty (he never did but washed his own dishes sometimes), used our small convection oven/airfryer for 40 plus mins at a time to reheat already cooked food on top of the energy his deep freezer took up. He would leave his blunt wrap trash on our coffee table along with his nasty tissues that he would twist into his nose. We gave up the upstairs bathroom because he would blow it up and close the door without a fan (he has stomach issues to add on top of it), his shit stains would be underneath the toilet seat and never cleaned it, would ask us for some of our weed and made us remind him to pay us back for the portions he took acting as if he forgot. He told us he planned on helping with some of our bills after he moved bc he had to save up for the uhaul and moving expenses yet was buying doordash and $30+ meals every other night yet only working 1-2 shifts a week. The room we let him use was disgusting with trash and tissues while he was here. He would sit in our living room w his hand in his pants, he would ask us to change the channel if we were watching something he didnt like OR he would watch Baddies and other loud obnoxious shows on his phone WHILE my partner and I were trying to watch our own thing and yes he did have a pair of headphones to use but never used them.

By the time week 4 was coming around we were READY for him to go. He told me he was gonna get  a uhaul to pack his stuff the night before he was set to move. Well that Friday comes around, he made a comment about not hearing from his leasing office and that he might have to wait til Monday. Partner and I said fuck no. I told him he should contact the office and make sure hes set bc thats what was promised. He said he would email them, I had to tell him to call them on the phone. Sure enough he got in touch and he was still set for Saturday. We go to hangout for the day, I tell him I need to be home by 6 to work on some house stuff. We go, he buys a $35 breakfast, i bought a $10 coffee (maybe even less). Barista puts our orders together, it comes to $45 and hes baffled. He looks at me and asks how much my coffee was 😂😂 I gave my $10 ($6-$8+tip) knowing damn well it wasnt more than that. I take him to a lake park downtown to walk around since he hasnt been around our area much since moving here intially. Hes talking about something, im listening responding. I start talking and get the feeling to stop my sentence short bc hes on his phone and not even paying attention to me. Whatever. I close my eyes and enjoy my “alone time” in the sun. We get ready to leave and this mf has the AUDACITY to bring up his birthday and show me a $62 perfume gift suggestion in case i wanted to get him something AFTER asking me earlier in the week to make him a cake. Im fuming at the entitlement in my head and made a comment ab not having the budget for that bc even Im struggling w bills rn. We get on the way home, I ask him ab his Uhaul plans and he tells me he needs to book one and asks if I wanna take him around 8-9pm. I said uhh no we can go now before we get home as it was about 5:30pm. We got food otw around 6 make it to the one he picks around 6:30, 20 mins goes by i ask if i can leave and he comes out to tell me theyre all booked and have to find a new one. He wants me to look up places hes suggesting, the closest one is 7 mins the alternative is 20. I tell him to book it before we arrive bc im not wasting time. Sure enough theres none available. Its getting to be way later than I wanted to be home so I told him im going home. We park in front of my house and he asks me if we can go to the one 20mins away. I told him im done i need to be home and that this shouldve been planned and paid for already. He goes okay, so do you wanna go around 7-8am?? I said sir….you need to get an uber, I have helped enough! 

Saturday morning comes, what do you know he was able to get the uhaul and pack it up all by himself. Dipped out after thanking us for 2 secs after i cane downstairs from waking up. After he left we found two broken blinds and our garbage disposal blades werent moving anymore even though they were working perfectly fine before him moving in. He also was supposed to clean the bathroom before he left as we made that clear about his poop stains and surprise surprise he didnt.

1jyo6kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jyo6kc/long_post_advice_welcome_please/,"Long post, advice welcome (please)","This is going to be a long post about breaking up with my kinda-boyfriend so I’ll just jump right into it. 

I (F, 26)met my kinda-boyfriend, let’s call him J, (M, 43) at a park in July 2023. I was reading alone and he approached me, asked for my number, I agreed and we hit it off straight away: we got talking a lot, found we had many similar interests and were sending multi-paragraph messages back and forth all day. We spoke about our futures too and we both wanted kids, wanted to move away from the city to buy land and ultimately our values lined up. The next time I saw him, he came over to my house and we watched a movie, and that happened a few times, to the point I expressed that I enjoyed his company and would love to be taken out on a date. He agreed, and despite us talking every day (still long messages) and him visiting my house every week or two, we never went on a date. He was always ‘busy’, which given his job I of course accepted and was supportive of. My thinking was that it was just a busy time in his life and I can wait for a date. 

Jump forward a few months to around May/June 2024, we were still ‘stuck’ in this same place of long messages, him visiting me and me cooking him lunch or dinner. We spoke about ‘our’ future and having kids and moving. I told him I wanted to move forward and think about kids around 27-28 years old, and he agreed. And I mentioned to him often how I was so excited to go on a date with him (we still hadn’t been on a date), how I was excited for him to ask me to be his girlfriend (which felt a bit childish but I wanted a clear ‘yes you are my girlfriend’ type commitment from him so I mentioned it). I invited him throughout the year we were talking to my monthly friend catch ups to meet my friends, which he declined saying he was busy when we had plans, and to meet my parents, which he always said ‘I wanted to but I’m a bit busy this time’. 

Even just typing this I’m thinking ‘why did I not see this’, how he simply wouldn’t commit. I hadn’t even seen his house or know his address by this point. I wasn’t sure he told his family about me, but he would also tell me he struggled with social anxiety and depression, and he was going through a tough busy time at work, and honestly I just wanted to be there to support him and wait until he could give me what I needed. 

In June 2024, I told him I was celebrating my birthday by going camping for 3 days with my friends and family, and he FINALLY agreed to come. I was over the moon, bought a bigger tent and airbed, spare camp chair. Paid for his place camping and organised all of our food to include him. 
Jump to July 2024, 1 week before my birthday and camp trip, he texts me in the middle of the day saying that he wanted to just be friends, when I actually thought this was going to be the weekend (the camp trip) that he would finally ask me to be his girlfriend. I was of course upset, asked him if I could at least call if he didn’t want to see me in person because that’s a pretty big thing to drop by text, and he didn’t, he just texted me. I went quiet that afternoon (I was working from home and had meetings to focus on) and that night he was texting me long paragraphs about how he just needs to focus on himself, he wants to be with me still but just needs to be friends. 
I was thinking.. well shit, this sucks but he wants a future with me. I shouldn’t wait for him so I’m not going to, but when he says he’s ready if I’m not dating, I would just set firmer boundaries about taking me on dates and committing to me and meeting my family. 

Looking back, I think he did this to get out of the camping trip. 

We still spoke every day, although I was still hurt, mainly because he wanted to end things over text, he seemed like he didn’t want to lose me and it made me think that he really did want to work on himself to be better to me. After about another month of texting, I told him that I deserve to be loved loudly, the whole experience. Meeting each other’s families. Dating. And he agreed. And we fell back into what was comfortable, texting every day, seeing each other at my house on weekends. 
I should mention up to this point we haven’t actually slept together either. Which I used to think was his way of respecting me, but the longer it went on, the more it makes me feel unattractive to him. 

During the last year I think we both got comfortable with this. I stopped asking for him to give me, what in my opinion is the bare minimum (happy for opposing opinions). I stopped asking to meet his family and stopped inviting him to my friends monthly catch ups because he always said no. I’ve still remained supportive of him and trying to be the best ‘partner’ (I’m not sure what to call it) to him I can be. 

Something else that’s important for me to say is that when we first started talking, I had lost a bit of weight and I mentioned once that I would consider implants in the future, after kids. Over the last year he’s been sending me instagram models posts of women with insanely large implants, for ‘inspiration’ which I usually just like react, because I thought it was weird but whatever. And he asked me a few months ago if he sent too many ‘boob’ photos on instagram, to which I replied ‘I do get jealous that you’re looking at other women online’. And his response was ‘I’m just giving you inspiration, if you looked like that I wouldn’t be looking online”. Which I KNOW.. I know what you’re thinking. Why the f would I accept that. I honestly justified it by thinking ‘oh he doesn’t mean it like that, he just wants to support me’ … 

Another thing that I feel is important, is that he always says ‘it’s hard to find women who want to have kids now’ or ‘it’s hard to find women who want to move out to the country and away from the city’. And previously I thought that was just him expressing past experiences, but now I feel like he’s just keeping me around in case he doesn’t find anything better. 

Throughout the whole time we’ve been ‘talking’, two years, I’ve been honest with what I want, dates, him to commit to me, to meet my friend and family. And he always just says he’s sorry he’s so busy and ‘why is my life so busy’ but keeps telling me he wants kids and wants the same with me etc. which is why I think I’ve stayed so long. 

I thought maybe it was me, and I asked him one time when he visited if I could be supporting him better (I was always supportive of him, always telling him I’m proud of him, listening to him complain about things in his life and telling him I’m always here for him etc) or if there was any needs of his I’m not meeting. And he said no, I was ‘perfect’. I know relationships are two sided and I have really tried to take a look at myself and how I can be better in this ‘relationship’. 

Anywho, after a few weeks of being fed up with being strung along for almost two years, I decided I was going to end things with him. Which absolutely sucks because I am so in love with him and I don’t want to hurt myself or him. But I also realise that my future husband wouldn’t wait two years to commit to me or take me out on a date. 
He came over this weekend and I think he had a sense that I was going to end things, and he was extra attentive. Telling me he wants to plan a date suggestion (I tried to give him suggestions so he could use them for a date idea, things like the aquarium, a coffee date, picnic or reading at the beach etc) that I gave him after Easter, talking about what he wants to get me for my birthday in July, talking about ‘our’ kids etc. and when we sat down at my table I was just about to talk to him about it and he started talking about how he had a rough childhood and he thinks that’s why he has a hard time in romantic relationships, and he started crying. Which absolutely broke my heart so I of course couldn’t end things. 

I guess I just want to know if anyone has been in a similar situation. If I’m doing the right thing not waiting for him any longer. And… how do I end things? The thought of hurting him feels like a sucker punch to the gut, I just… I’m lost and I have nobody to talk to. Any advice would be appreciated.

Eventually, thankfully, that mostly faded and I was left with hardly any smell, with triggers like coffee [even though that’s been my career for 15 years!], mint, garlic, onions.. seemingly the usual suspects.

Well this previous Monday I had half a serving of Chaga in a coffee [which I have only been able to drink if it’s sweetened with certain sweeteners that sort of made it a slightly drinkable cup]. Then Tuesday morning, I had a full serving. By Tuesday afternoon I was DUMBFOUNDED because out of nowhere most of my smell came back! I ran around my cafe smelling and tasting everything I could.

So I’ve been on Vyvanse for two months now. 45/m, pretty sure I’ve been ADHD since childhood. But never thought I fit the mold (hell, never thought I fit any mold, really) for it. My own son getting diagnosed at age eight got me thinking. Did a few deep dives into symptoms in adults and it read like my autobiography. Right down to “not lazy, but not focused”, and then there was/is my alcoholism. But I digress.

My doctor started me on 20mg for a month. I took it just before breakfast (about 6:30am) on weekdays so that I was ready to go when I clock in at 7:30. Breakfast usually consists of high fiber and protein cereal w/banana and berries, cup of black coffee to follow. 

I found that in the morning, I was full of energy and focus. My coworkers noticed immediately. But then, like clockwork right after lunch (usually a salad or grilled chicken, or both), I would get tired, moody, unfocused, you name it. And then I bring that mentality home. Talked to my doctor about it and he recommended I go up to 30mg and take it a bit later. But I am still having that afternoon crash. 

I would appreciate any and all tips. I work  health care administration desk job by day, and then go home to help my kids with their homework and handle the usual laundry, cooking duties in the evening (wife owns a business, gets the kids up in the morning, gets them off to school and then usually works in the afternoon and evening).

Time for a quick check on your Aussie know-how. We're talking about a true blue Aussie ritual involving the legendary Tim Tam biscuit (cheers, Arnott's, since 1964!).

**The Question:** What exactly is the ""Tim Tam Slam""?

* A) A new footy tackling technique
* B) A dance move popular in the outback
* C) A bloody delicious way to eat a Tim Tam
* D) A craft beer from Tassie

**Need a hint? Fair dinkum:** It involves biting off opposite corners of the Tim Tam, using it like a straw for your hot cuppa (coffee, tea, Milo, hot choccy – your pick!), and then popping the melty, gooey goodness in your mouth before it collapses.

**Bonus Fun Fact:** Did you know Tim Tams were named after a racehorse? Yep, a horse that won the Kentucky Derby back in 1958! Mad.

we saw each other almost everyday and used to text about anything all day long. 
Untill january, when she reconnected with a boy and he broke her heart (I mean they went out like two times). since that happened she disappeared. I texted her every now and then, and when I asked she would go out for coffee with me, but after a month and a half I noticed that not a single text came from her first. 
I asked if everything was ok between us and she told me that she was just sad lately but it had nothing to do with me. 
I'm pretty sure it was about the guy I mentioned before. A month went by (no texts from her) and unfortunately her grandfather had a heart attack (he survived it luckily). I obviously put my ego aside and comforted her everyday for weeks. He is still recovering 'cause he is old so it takes time. 
But, idk, I know it probably sounds selfish but it's making me suffer to be ignored like this. I would never tell her anything right now bc of her grandfather but I can't bring myself to text her. I don't wanna hear from her because I have so much hurt inside of me. I genuinely can't comprehend her behavior because I'm the opposite (not saying my way is the right way). Nothing ever made me ghost my friends, I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for 8 years but I never acted like my friends didn't exist. I can kinda get it more because of the grandpa.. but for a boy? I have been broken too but I've always been there for her. when we see each other she only talks about how much her life sucks and doesn't even ask how I've been. 
I feel really alone, I feel like anything that comes into her life makes her forget about me (good or bad). I have no friends so I barely go out and I'm going crazy not talking to anyone. I've spent the last two days in the hospital for my mother, my aunt and other relatives (bad luck is thriving right now) and she doesn't even know because she still hasn't texted me once. I somehow still managed to ask my bf and my other bfs about their day! Idk I feel like I'm too harsh but at the same time I always put her feelings above mine. I'm sure that even if a boy dumps you, it's wrong to disappear from your bfs. am I insane? ",1,1744596382.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

I’d prefer it to just be the white haired version of her on the art , also would prefer it to not be too busy with too many bodies. And it can have text if you think it’ll look good 

And if possible I know she isn’t from a manga but if there’s a way to add b&w manga style panel art of her in some sections of the art that’d be awesome but if you can’t it’s ok

After the first 2 dishes were both a crit, I went ""well dang, might as well finish it."" Bought a couple whistles with sleep points so I could cook dinner and take it over the edge.

GCT, 2 whistles (no whistles on other islands, with a bit more prep wouldn't have needed them here, just took the opportunity when luck struck). No berry bombs on any island. Desserts, electric steel and psychic berries this week. My base team with desserts and psychic berries is very strong, and grepa happens to have my strongest berry specialists (at least level-wise) since OGPP was on my list to aim for soon. My coffee farmer also is steel, so wasn't mad about that.

Last week I hit just under 6mil. Had worse berries that didn't help at all, so I saved a bit of my ingredients for this week and sure glad I did. Ran dedenne for 2 to 3 triggers for a mostly permanent cooking bonus, tons of Extra Tasty, and making Eclairs or Zap Cola for every meal (both level 60). Golduck is always a beast during the day, Espeon was absolutely crushing it with the 1.5x triggers though. Gardevoir, Golduck, and Espeon were my backbone for every single M20 run, with the last 2 slots generally being a berry specialist and 1 ingredient specialist cycling to keep from falling behind on the stock too much. Golduck generally swapped out at night for whichever ingredient specialist has Inv L (like venasaur). The extra ingredients from Espeon. Gardevoir really helped for supplementary milk/cocoa/leeks/apples. I do swap around a decent bit, just like to micromanage.

Here's hoping with 2x drowsy power I see something decent. Using Crasselio \[edit for automod\] and luck incense, and going to move a couple Dream Shard Bonus onto the team.

Sometimes it feels like there's this huge pressure to make grand gestures or spend hours every week ""working on"" our relationships. We see curated perfection online and it can feel overwhelming, right? Like, who has the time or energy to add *another* complicated thing to their plate?

Life is already busy enough! Between work, family, chores and trying to squeeze in some downtime, adding elaborate relationship-building strategies can feel impossible.

But here's the thing I keep reminding myself: **strengthening connections doesn't have to be complicated.** Often, it's the small, consistent things that make the biggest difference over time.

Here are a few ideas for nurturing relationships *without* turning your life upside down:

*   **Focus on micro-connections:** A quick ""thinking of you"" text, sharing a relevant article or funny meme, leaving a thoughtful comment on their post (beyond just a 'like'). These take seconds but show you care.
*   **Piggyback on existing routines:** Can you call a friend during your commute instead of listening to a podcast? Can you schedule a quick coffee catch-up before your weekly grocery run? Fit connection into the cracks of your existing schedule.
*   **Remember the little things:** Jotting down a note when someone mentions an upcoming event, a favourite coffee order or something they're struggling with can make future interactions much more meaningful. Remembering shows you *listen*. (You don't need a fancy system, even a note on your phone works!)
*   **Be present when you *are* together:** Put the phone away during conversations. Really listen. Quality of time often matters more than sheer quantity. Even 15 minutes of focused conversation can be more impactful than an hour of distracted hanging out.
*   **Lower the bar for reaching out:** It doesn't always have to be a deep, hour-long call. A simple ""Hey, how have you been?"" is often enough to keep the connection warm.

It's about finding sustainable ways to show up for people that fit *your* life. Small, genuine efforts compound.",1,1744595552.0,TouchBase,0,1.0,False

I feel like im getting mixed signals?,"I 21M met 25F at college orientation. We have a shared interest in high fashion. We have hung out three times so far.

We have hung out twice during the weekends. Our first hangout, outside of school lasted about 7 hours. Only expected it to last four. We went to a museum and got dinner. During out hangout She gave me very specific compliments like how I know how to set boundaries and I am very observant and how I have a good sense of direction (which she doesn't have lol) We were talking almost the entire time. We chilled at a viewpoint in my car and talked for a while. I called her beautiful and she thanked me and giggled. After that I offered to drop her off and she said she didn't mind and we hung out a little more. Dropped her off and she wished me good luck this quarter and a safe drive home.

2 weeks go by and we hangout again. This time only for 6 hours but I felt like it went well. She met my parents as we came across them at the event we were at. She was engaging with them asking them questions and thanked me as they were very ""knowledgeable"" We left a little early to go to a clothing store. She sent me two classes related to my culture over text and in person she told me she emailed both professors asking if there was availability which I thought was really sweet of her to do. She also brought me a snack.

During out hangout walking back to my car I said she looked good today and she giggled again and downplayed saying she just rolled out of bed. I asked her about her schedule during out hangout and she asked about mine and turns out we have a break at the same time and I offered to get coffee with her and she agreed and put it in her schedule. I asked for her number as I dropped her off and she gave it to me.

I feel like there's potential here. While talking we make a lot of eye contact and during out hangouts she is barley on her phone and present. Carrying the conversations, asking me questions, opening up about her personal life and family. But at the same time since I'm insecure I'm thinking she's just being friendly.

I'm super excited to announce our new Moderators-in-Training ('MiTs') for our community! Thank you all for your patience despite the delay in announcements, we are extremely grateful for it.

Although we may not have had as many applications as last time, it was still great to read through them and evaluate your applications and evaluate them. As stated in the [delay announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdoptMeRBX/comments/1juxwki/୨_mod_post_modintraining_announcement_delays_୧/) post, we have chosen >!four!< applicants to add as MiTs. Thank you all so much to those who applied, again, we encourage you to apply again if you didn't get in this time :)

On a personal note, I am disappointed by those who didn't reach out requirements and didn't ask to be exempt.

This section is for transparency on how our process works regarding choosing to promote our Mod Trainees.

Not all MiTs will be promoted to moderators at the same time. We will have a 1-4 week period of surveillance, where they'll be monitored on how they handle ModMails, how they use moderating tools, interact with users, general activity, and more.

Once all four weeks are up, all the MiTs who will be moderators should be promoted by then. If they do not pass training, they will be let go of the team, and will always have an opportunity to re-apply in the future!

We're looking forward to walking with all of the new mods! 👀🫶

Yesterday, I went to visit my grandmother who was in hospice because she seemed to have less than a week to live. I witnessed her take her last breath which was unexpected. As soon as my grandfather noticed, he was bawling. I felt disconnected with how other family members were expressing their grief because I'm autistic and not religious. I wanted to comfort my grandfather, but I did not know what know what to say at that moment and could only offer him a firm hug and felt bad about myself.

Today, I tried asking one of my friends from last semester if she wanted to hang out and get some coffee sometime during the summer to kick it off with a nice start. She previously said she was busy for much of this semester, so I figured she would want to hang out during the summer since she saved a similar message months ago. I was NOT looking for a relationship with her and just wanted to hang out as friends. Right after she read the message, she blocked me on every single social media platform. I'm assuming she thought I was secretly pursuing a relationship with her. Now I'm scared of messaging anyone with good intentions just to get completely cut off again. I do not know if it was because I never messaged during this semester due I how busy I was. I admit that I had somewhat of the ""nice guy"" mindset during late high school, but I snapped out of it. I have no idea if I am still being that terrible person.

I hate how this type of pattern keeps on repeating. Any time I try to deepen a connection it disappears. I feel closer with my friends than my family because my family keeps pressuring to conform to their religion. I do not want to keep losing my friends because my friends are the only ones who I relate to. I sometimes think that my friends are secretly annoyed by me. It's already difficult for me to make friends, so how can I even expect a relationship?

I'm so sick and tired of this pattern, and I do not know what to do because my family's advice/solutions are not applicable.

What did I do wrong? What should I improve on? Should I still look for a relationship? If so, how can I do so without pushing people away from me?",7,1744595143.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

1jynmh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausadhd/comments/1jynmh5/anyone_else_sick_of_being_messed_around_and/,Anyone else sick of being messed around and considering ditching the stimulants?,"I’ve been diagnosed and medicated with Concerta and Ritalin boosters for a little under a year at 38 yo. (I previously took vyvanse which was terrible for me for multiple reasons)

After months of trial and error I finally found my sweet spot in terms of dose (concerta 36 mg and Ritalin boosters during luteal phase) only for concerta 36 being out of stock everywhere a few months in.

I have been getting by on 27mg with more boosters but it’s not been ideal due to the inconsistency throughout the day. I don’t want to think and wonder about the next top up all day long and don’t like the rush and jitters from boosters. 

I’ve added 1mg guanfacine about a month ago. The first couple of days were amazingly calm, focused and generally happy- followed by a week of rage and out of control RSD, headaches and insomnia. The emotional issues settled about 10 days in and I’ve managed to control the sleeping issues by taking the guanfacine at midday (again after 3 weeks of trial and error). 

In the last month, due to a lucky fluke, I was able to get 36mg concerta again and the combo with guanfacine worked really well - but of course now that dose is unavailable again.

Reading about the upcoming shortages for all dosages of concerta and even Ritalin IR I’m getting over the constant “tight rope walk” off trying to balance my medication - on top of hormonal imbalances throughout the month - while also trying to manage full time study and raising a young family. 

I want to ditch the stimulants completely. 

I’m sick of being dependent on a substance that is not readily available and so vilified that you’re being treated as a drug seeker when you’re simply trying to be organised so you don’t run out of the medication - that makes you function like a normal human being-  in the middle of writing your thesis or sitting exams!!!

I’ve been finding that guanfacine alone is great with controlling my moods and RSD, and it also helps with concentration a ton. However, a month in I’m still feeling tried (especially in the morning before my daily midday dose).  That, combined with my lack of anxiety induced urgency, is messing with my motivation a lot. I’ve been procrastinating a lot more recently, especially on days when I didn’t take any stimulants.

So after all this backstory, my question is: 

Is anyone finding success with guanfacine alone? 

- Has the general low energy and motivation settled for anyone? 
- Has anyone found those effects to lessen with a higher dose? 

Are there any natural stimulants that helped with energy levels and motivation? I don’t drink coffee and am trying to limit black tea as I’m chronically low on iron. I’ve recently started drinking yerba mate tea which helps somewhat but not as much as concerta obviously. I’m considering trying guarana.

- any success stories or alternative suggestions ? 

Anyone else sick of bei being messed around with stimulants? How are you planning to navigate the shortage?

1jynmfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1jynmfi/adderall_xr_hell/,Adderall XR hell,"Hi friends- I’m a relatively newly diagnosed adult and have been playing around with adderall dosages with my psychiatrist.

I started off with the “tolerance test” for a little over a month with 2 IRs a day (20 each, occasionally split in half to take 10-20 or 20-10 or 10-10 depending on day). 

It was fine, but I mentioned that I must metabolize it quickly because midday and evening crashes were hard. For added context, I’m being tested for other disorders that would call for stimulants so that’s why we started decently high. My exhaustion is life-ruining. 

She then decided to go ahead and prescribe me a couple weeks of 30mg XR plus some IR if I needed a “boost”. Well, turns out my pharmacy was out of XR for a couple of weeks. In that time, I started taking my IR 3x a day as 10-20-10 in order to fight off crashes. It worked perfectly! My mood was stabilized but not numbed/blunted, my focus was easy, I could control dosing, my schedule was predictable, I cut coffee, I was able to live my life for once. And I could sleep!

Then my 30 mg XR was filled. I HATE it. I have a bad crash within 3 hours, and the second “extended release” dose doesn’t even touch me. I’m irritable, emotional, and just generally exhausted and grumpy. Nothing helps. I go running, come back in same mood. I try to meditate/yoga- well, actually, barely, because I’m so exhausted and irritable that I get mad halfway through. I physically feel weird. Not dangerous or bad, but just weird. And my sleep isn’t great. With the IR boost, without it… doesn’t matter. I feel like crap.

I have a check in appt on Wednesday, but my gosh, I don’t know if I can make it until then. I’m gonna ask about staying on IR. I’ve never felt better and more stable in my life than being on that dosing plan. 

Anyone else go through similar? Is this normal on XR?",3,1744595102.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False
1jynlhm,https://i.redd.it/uoyui4bngpue1.png,Late Night Delivery,"Alya’s eyes were glued to the glowing screen of her phone, her thumb scrolling absentmindedly through TikTok. She wasn’t even really watching anymore—the catchy tunes, the voiceovers, the lip-syncing influencers—all of it had faded into white noise. The blue light from the phone reflected off her tired face as she mindlessly scrolled, waiting for the next video to distract her. It was well past midnight, and her stomach had been growling for hours.

Her apartment was quiet, save for the soft hum of her phone and the occasional click of the cooling fan in the corner. She felt the hunger pangs gnawing at her stomach, and her mind started to wander to the one thing she knew would satisfy it: fast food.

The clock in the corner of the screen flashed: 1:42 AM. She needed something—something greasy, salty, and warm. McDonald's? No, she was tired of that. KFC? Maybe, but it was late. Fast Guys? They closed at 11. She sighed, reluctantly grabbing her phone to check the app.

As she scrolled through, her finger stopped at an unfamiliar banner. It was black with simple white text:

""Midnight Meals - Available from 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM Only. Discreet. No questions asked.""

Alya blinked. She had never seen this option before. No logos, no restaurant name—just a minimalist text box with the words Chef’s Choice - RM15. Curiosity got the best of her. Her finger hovered over the Order Now button, then tapped it without a second thought. It was just food, after all, right? What could go wrong?


---

Within ten minutes, there was a knock at the door. Fast delivery. Too fast.

Alya was still distracted by her phone, too focused on some random TikTok trend she was half-watching, half-skirting, when she opened the door. A tall man stood there, holding the bag of food. He wore a black jacket, a dark cap that shadowed his eyes, and a smile.

Not just any smile.

A wide, unsettling smile that didn’t move. It was too still, too perfect. It looked almost fake—like someone had painted it on his face. His eyes, hidden in shadow, didn’t meet hers as he passed the bag over, nodding once before turning and walking away without a word.

She didn’t think much of it. Maybe it was just some late-night driver, probably tired, probably just doing his job.

Alya closed the door, shaking off the unease, and returned to her couch. Still engrossed in her phone, she placed the bag on the coffee table and opened it. She didn’t even look at the food as she pulled out the box, still scrolling through her feed.

The smell hit her first—rich, savory, yet slightly metallic. It wasn’t the usual fried chicken scent she expected, but it was undeniably appetizing. She shrugged and dug in, still distracted by the screen in her hand. She grabbed a fork, stabbed a piece of meat, and shoved it into her mouth without hesitation.

The texture was soft, almost spongy. It didn’t taste like chicken—at least, not like any chicken she had ever had. It was rich and slightly sweet, with a meaty undertone that lingered on her tongue in an unsettling way. But it was good. So good. She didn’t stop eating. She didn’t even care that it didn’t taste like KFC.

“This is weird,” she mumbled to herself, her mouth full of food. She glanced down at the meat, but only for a moment. Something about it felt off, but the hunger in her gut overpowered her caution. She kept eating.

The entire meal was consumed within minutes, gone before she could really pay attention to what she had eaten. The box was empty, the meat gone, the strange aftertaste lingering on her tongue. She barely even looked at what she had just devoured.

“Whatever,” she muttered, tossing the box aside. She scrolled through another few TikTok videos, completely unaware of how deeply the meal had already begun to affect her.


---

The next night, Alya was back on the app, fingers itching for another fix. Midnight Meals appeared again—always the same option, always available. She ordered again. She had no idea why. She hadn’t really thought about it. Maybe she was just craving more of the weirdly satisfying meal.

The delivery came in less than ten minutes. Same delivery guy, same eerie, frozen smile. The bag was handed to her without a word, and he was gone before she could even thank him.

She didn’t care. She grabbed the bag, opened it, and ate.

The same meat. The same strange texture. But now, it wasn’t just satisfying. It felt necessary. She needed it. Her body craved it.


---

For the next few weeks, Alya’s routine stayed the same. She ordered the “Midnight Meals” every night. Each night, the delivery came just as fast, with the same unnerving delivery guy, his smile never changing. She never paid attention to the food beyond the first bite. Her phone was always there, her eyes glued to the screen, her mind distracted by whatever nonsense TikTok was offering.

But it was becoming a problem. A craving was taking root inside her, deep in her gut, and it grew with each passing day. She didn’t want anything else. She didn’t need anything else. Just the food. Every night.

She started noticing things—small things, unsettling things. Her skin was growing paler, her appetite for regular food was waning. She no longer found joy in eating anything else. It was as if the food was the only thing that could fill the hollow space inside her.


---

One night, after weeks of this strange obsession, Alya sat down to her usual meal. She had been scrolling through TikTok again, but tonight something was different. She felt… off.

Maybe it was the constant cravings. Maybe it was the nagging feeling that she hadn’t really been paying attention to what she was eating. She stared at the food on her plate, her stomach still hungry, but now her curiosity was gnawing at her.

She set the phone aside. For the first time in weeks, she put it down. She wanted to look at the food. Really look at it.

She slowly opened the box.

A gasp escaped her lips.

There, sitting on the plastic tray, was a bloody, raw lung. The crimson, fleshy organ was still twitching slightly, the veins running through it visible under the pale light. Alya recoiled in horror, her stomach flipping in disgust. She blinked, rubbed her eyes, but it was still there. Still real.

Her phone buzzed on the table beside her, and for a moment, she almost reached for it. To distract herself, to pull herself away from the nightmare she was seeing. But something stopped her. She stared at the lung. The blood. The meat.

The craving.

She reached out, her hand shaking. It was almost compulsive. She had to eat it. She didn’t know why. She couldn’t explain it.

Alya dug her fork into the flesh of the organ. It was tender. It was delicious.

She couldn’t stop.

---

The next night, Alya wasn’t hungry anymore. She was starving.

Now I know why the following is so important:

1. LOVING yourself or at least respecting yourself more than you'll ever love anyone.

2. Building relations primarily not out of emotion (even the good ones) but LOGIC (60:40 logic to emotion ratio).

3. Don't romanticize giving your all for someone who doesn't deserve even 1% of it. ""I'll love as much as I can"" no dude, get a fucking job instead of getting on that loser bs.

If there's a lesson for any readers in this who certainly are thinking this guy is crashing out right now, it's to not expect anything from the closest of people and not rely too much on anyone EVER but yourself, whether emotionally or some other way.

I’ve been messing with my Barista Pro for the last 5 hours and… I’m at my wits’ end. I bought it brand new about a month ago during an Amazon sale, and this is only my second day actually using it. I haven’t been able to pull a single good shot.

I’ve tried beans roasted on 2/27, 3/27, and most recently 4/9 — so relatively fresh. Keep in mind, I just opened the machine a week ago. The *closest* I’ve come to a decent shot is with the inner grind set to 2 and the outer at 1. And by “closest,” I mean something *barely* passable as a drink. If not in this setting, there is splashing EVERYWHERE.

I’ve been chatting with a super helpful member here for the past 5 hours — sending videos, photos, explaining my workflow, etc. After all that, we both came to the same conclusion: something’s off with my grinder. He mentioned there’s no reason I should need to grind *this* fine on a brand-new machine just to get *barely* decent results. He even sent me a video of him pulling a great shot with Amazon beans that weren’t super fresh — and he was using a coarser setting than I am.

I reached out to Amazon, and they said they’d refund me if I return the machine — which is great. The thing is, I actually really *like* the machine. It’s beautiful. But I’m torn on what to do next.

Here are the options I’m weighing:

1. **Buy a separate grinder** and test it out. If it works, then great — I know it was the built-in grinder. If I still get the same bad shots (which I doubt), then maybe it’s something I’m doing wrong. But I’ve been super meticulous — I used to work in a coffee shop, so I’m not new to espresso.
2. **Return the Barista Pro**, get my refund, and invest in a separate grinder and espresso machine. But that opens up a whole new can of worms: *what do I get next?*

If anyone has any thoughts, suggestions, or recommendations, I’d seriously appreciate it. I’m feeling frustrated, annoyed, and a little defeated. Thanks in advance!",4,1744594269.0,espresso,18,0.83,False

1jynd13,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jynd13/there_is_something_stalking_the_village_of_nenana/,"There is something stalking the village of Nenana, Alaska (Part 1 and 2)","Hello all. My computer has just flickered on. The lights outside must be fucking with the power again. I’m typing this as fast as I can, so apologies for any misspellings. My hands are shaking. The fire went out hours ago and I’m too afraid to relight it—relight my humble beacon against the lights.

Those goddamn lights.

The village of Nenana is a peaceful place. Fewer than 50 of us. We live out in the bushes, central Alaska, north of any reasonable human, along the Sushana River. It’s quiet here. We hunt, fish, work the forest for timber, and keep to ourselves. Folks from Outside pass through sometimes, pause, marvel at the little log houses, and gawk as we go about our daily lives. I was born here. I was raised here. And from the looks of things, I’ll die here.

I’m a young man, 20 winters. Raised by my grandparents after my father passed in a blizzard while hunting. I still remember his frozen body as it was dragged on the sled behind the snowmachine. His face—blue-black, like the crimson dark of night. I remember his eyes. I remember the village gathering, a lone drumbeat echoing like the heartbeat of our community. I saw a raven fly. We laid him to rest—a whole day of mourning, and everyone came.

I saw it once. Before everything really started to go bad. I was out hunting caribou on the flats north of the river, a couple miles past the old trapper’s line. It was cold, late November. I had my .243 and a thermos of tea, and I’d been tracking a small herd that’d wandered down from the foothills. It was quiet—too quiet. No wind, no birds, not even the distant groan of ice shifting beneath the snow. Just me, the rifle, and my breath clouding the air.

I spotted the caribou standing still in a patch of stunted willows. I took a knee, lined up my shot, and then something made me stop. Not a sound. Not a movement. Just… a feeling. Like I wasn’t alone. Like something was watching me. I turned my head just a little—and that’s when I saw it.

It was standing at the tree line, maybe two hundred yards off. Tall. Too tall. Like a man, but stretched. Arms longer than they should’ve been, fingertips grazing its knees. Its head was wrong—like it was wearing something. At first I thought it was a caribou skull. But it moved. Antlers shifting, twitching like branches in a storm. No face. No features. Just those two pits of darkness where its eyes should’ve been, sucking in the light of day.

The caribou didn’t see it. Or maybe they did and froze. They’re prey animals—they know when a real predator’s near.

I didn’t take the shot. I don’t even remember lowering the rifle. Just that one second I looked, and then it was gone. Like it blinked out of existence.

I told myself it was a trick of the light. A shadow. Too much caffeine. But deep down, I knew better. That was no animal. That wasn’t anything I was meant to see.

It started months ago. Or was it weeks? Hell, it might’ve been yesterday. First, Old Isaiah didn’t stop in. I was working my incredibly boring job at our town’s only gas station and general store. Sitting behind my desk, I watched our people ebb and flow, tumbling through life like the river. Every day that man came in. He shuffled with a limp, walked like a just-born caribou calf. Lived on the edge of town, in a run-down cabin left behind when some family moved Outside. I found comfort in his visits—in our silent exchanges, in the same bag of coffee grounds, the same nod, the same mumble as I handed him his change.

Then one day he didn’t come.

I waited, drumming my fingers on the counter in time with the twangy country music on the radio. Zach Bryan, maybe? I always hated him. But Isaiah didn’t show. I brushed it off. Maybe his shitbox pickup finally died. Maybe he just didn’t want coffee. Maybe he was out of money. I passed it off. Continued my day.

Zero customers. New record.

A few days passed. Still no Isaiah. No one said anything, but I started noticing the way folks looked over their shoulders. It was like a quiet breath had passed through the village, taking something with it.

Then the dogs started acting strange. My neighbor, a crusty old man named Jimbo with a beard that looked like frostbite, came in one morning—eyes wide, skin pale like he’d seen something deep. He said all three of his sled dogs had broken their leads and run off in the night. “Tails tucked. Howlin’ like the spirits were on their asses.” That’s what he said. I laughed it off, but there was something in his voice. He wasn’t joking.

Jimbo don’t scare easy.

The air felt… wrong.

The lights started acting strange after that.

You hear stories, growing up here. How the northern lights are the spirits of the dead. That you should never whistle at them or wave, or they’ll come down and take you with them. I always thought that was just stuff my grandma said to keep me from playing outside too late.

But one night I looked up, and they were… pulsing. Not like normal. Not pretty or gentle. These twisted. Seethed. Like something alive. They weren’t green. They were red. Blood red, like an open wound across the sky.

And I swear to God, I heard something whisper my name.

That was the first time I dreamed of the thing. It stood just past the treeline behind my cabin. Seven feet tall. Blacker than shadow. Its arms were too long, and its eyes didn’t glow—they swallowed light. No face. No sound. Just... there. Watching. When I woke up, there were footprints in the snow. Big ones. Leading up to my window. Then stopping.

I told myself it was a moose. A weird dream. A dumb coincidence.

But I didn’t sleep the next night.

We’re Gwich’in here. Most of us. My family too, though we’ve got some Koyukon blood, way back. This land—it’s ours. Not just because we live here, but because it remembers us. Our stories are written in the rivers, in the bones buried beneath the permafrost. The ancestors are supposed to watch over us. Guide us.

But lately, it feels like they’ve turned their backs.

Then Isaiah’s cabin caught fire.

No one saw it happen. Just smoke in the morning and ash by noon. No body found. No tracks. Just scorched earth and twisted timber. Folks said he probably left town, took a lantern with him and knocked something over.

But I know Isaiah. The man could barely walk. He wouldn’t have gone anywhere.

After that, more people started disappearing. Not in crowds. Just one by one. Like the lights reached a little lower each night, and someone would vanish.

No one talked about it. Not directly. But you could feel it—like the whole village was holding its breath. Doors locked earlier. Radios went quiet. Everyone was watching the sky.

And I...

I started seeing things. Shapes. Movements in the trees. Reflections in the windows that weren’t mine. My own shadow stretching longer than it should. The lights got inside. Not the house. Inside me.

The elders used to talk about things—not to be spoken of after dark. Stories about creatures that live between worlds. The ones that come in winter, when the light hangs in the sky and the snow deadens all sound. My grandma used to say there were places the spirits never stopped walking. Places too old and too quiet for us to understand.

I never believed in those stories.

Until now.

Old Annie, one of the last true matriarchs in the village, started talking nonsense. Said she saw something with bone antlers and a stitched mouth walking along the ridgeline. Said it wore the skins of people it took. That it mimicked voices—called from the woods in the tones of lost loved ones. A trickster spirit. A hunter.

We didn’t believe her.

She froze to death on her porch the next night. Sitting straight up. Eyes open. Mouth slack—like she’d seen God and He’d walked past without noticing her.

After that, some of the Gwich’in packed up. Said they were heading Outside, or down to stay with relatives in another village. The old ways say to leave when the spirits get thick in the air. When the dogs refuse to go outside. When the ravens stop circling. I wanted to go too. But something kept me here.

Or maybe I just didn’t want to bring it with me.

It’s hard to explain the way the lights look now. They don’t shimmer. They crawl. Like they’re made of something solid, reaching down from the heavens. You stare too long and your thoughts turn inside out. You start remembering things you never lived. Blood in the snow. Screams that don’t belong to anyone you know. You forget where you are.

One night, I heard my dad’s voice outside the cabin. He’s been dead ten years.

“Open up, boy,” he said. Just like he used to when he’d get home from hunting. “It’s cold as a witch’s tit out here.”

I almost opened the door.

Almost.

Then I saw the shadow pass the window.

It wasn’t him.

Now it’s just me. Everyone’s gone. Or dead. I don’t know anymore.

The general store’s empty. The generator blew two nights ago. The river’s frozen stiff. No snowmachines. No dogs. No one.

I’m holed up in the old garage cabin now. Mine was too close to the treeline. Too exposed. I’ve boarded the windows. Blocked the chimney. I haven’t seen the stars in days—just the lights. Always the lights.

It stands outside now. I see it every night. Just past the trees. Antlers scraped raw. Eyes like holes in the world.

Waiting.

Watching.

Sometimes I think it is the lights. Or the lights are just the smoke it gives off. The radiation of its mind burning through the sky.

I don’t sleep anymore. I don’t eat much. I keep this computer warm in my sleeping bag just so I can write. Just so someone might know what happened here. Maybe if the next person reads this, they won’t make the same mistakes. Maybe they won’t whistle at the lights.

They never tell you that madness is gentle at first.

Just a flicker.

A whisper.

Then it opens its eyes.

**Part Two – Downriver**

My name’s Baptiste DuMont. I trap lines between Fairbanks and Nenana—mostly marten and fox this time of year, sometimes lynx if I’m lucky. I make my rounds late in the fall, head upriver before freeze-up, and paddle down after. I don’t rush. There’s no one waiting for me.

It was early December when I rounded the bend where the Sushana feeds into the Tanana. Ice was gathering at the edges, slow and stubborn, but the current still moved. It was too late for most folks to be out, but I’d gotten hung up in a snowstorm west of Manley and figured I’d swing by Nenana for fuel and dry socks before I pulled in for the season.

I’ve been going through Nenana for over twenty years. Always liked that village. Small, tight-knit. Mostly Gwich’in, some Koyukon families. Good people. The kids used to wave from the riverbank when I’d float by. Old folks would sometimes trade dry meat for pelts. There was a rhythm to the place. Like an old drumbeat you could count on.

But when I landed, the rhythm was gone.

The first thing I noticed was the silence. No smoke from chimneys. No barking dogs. No snowmachines rumbling in the distance. Just my paddle knocking ice chunks and the soft gurgle of the river dying for the season.

I pulled my canoe up near the old boat ramp and climbed the bank. Everything was still. Too still.

The houses stood like hollow bones—doors swinging open, windows boarded or broken. The general store was shuttered, the gas pumps iced over. I called out. No answer. Walked through the center of town, listening for a baby crying, a fire crackling, hell—even a raven. Nothing.

I found footprints, though. One set. Deep in the snow, heading out toward the far side of the village. Toward the tree line.

They were old. Week old, maybe more. Melted into the snow so much that they barely resembled boot tracks.

At first, I thought someone had stayed behind. Maybe sick or stuck or scared. But the longer I followed them, the more I realized something was wrong. They wandered. Back and forth. Looping around cabins. Stopping in the middle of the road like the person forgot where they were going. Like they were being hunted—or trying to decide whether to run.

Then I found the old garage cabin.

Door barricaded from the inside. Smoke-stained windows. A pile of wood chopped and stacked out back, long turned to ice. There were scratches in the siding—high up, maybe eight feet off the ground. Deep ones. Not from a bear.

I pried the door open with my axe. Took everything I had. The cold inside hit me like a wall. No heat. No fire.

The first thing that struck me was the axe. Slammed into the frame above the door. An old felling axe, its birch handle white against the smear of dried blood which ran down the handle like a open wound in the wood. 

I stepped over the broken door, moved under the axe. Shell casings littered the floor. Rifle rounds. I saw a hunting rifle, bent almost clean in half. The stock was splintered, barrel bent like it was made of plastic rather than steel. Dried blood littered the floor. Old. Not red enough to be fresh, but still red enough to be blood.

There was a cot. A sleeping bag. A laptop—dead now, screen cracked. Notebooks scattered around the floor. Drawings in charcoal and pen. Symbols I didn’t recognize. A figure sketched over and over—tall, antlers like driftwood, face a blur of black ink. Always standing. Always watching.

Blood covered the cot, plaid wool blanket ripped off as if its owner was torn out, ripped like the guts out of a fish. The blood led up to foot of a ladder, must go to the storage loft I figured. I told myself I’d check it out later.

I found the last page taped to the wall above the cot.

*""Don’t look at the lights. Don’t speak to the voice. Don’t leave the cabin.""*

Underneath, scratched in shaky handwriting: *“The river forgets, but the woods remember.”*

I was getting scared now. I hadn’t been that scared in years. My hands shook, I drew my knife. I don’t know why, but it made me feel more comfortable. I started to climb the ladder, it creaked under my weight. 

He sat curled in the loft. Back to the window. He was frozen. The cheery “Iditarod 2020 Team ReRun” t-shirt crusted with frost. Braids flopped lifeless against the floor, one covering his face. There was a pool of frozen blood beneath his head. A revolver lay next to his hand. A single hole in the side of his head showed as the only sign of death. I picked up the revolver, held it, spun the cilinder. One spent casing. 

That night, I stayed in the store. To tell you the truth, I was scared to leave. Lit a fire in the back room stove. Tried to sleep.

The lights came out around midnight.

I watched from under a blanket, through a crack in the door.

They didn’t dance. They spun, slow and heavy, like something breathing. Red and green and something deeper—colors I don’t have words for. And for a moment, I saw it.

On the ridge. Against the aurora.

Tall.

Still.

Head crowned in antlers that scraped the sky.

It didn’t move. But I swear it saw me.

I left at dawn. Didn’t take the time to grab more firewood or refill my lantern. Just pushed off from the bank and paddled hard until the village was a smudge behind me.

I won’t go back.

Not to Nenana.

Not to those woods.

Something’s out there.

And it’s waiting.

Here is the background - 

My husband's parents are deeply religious (christian) and just moved to America several years ago from South America. They don’t speak English very well (important context). When we met they seemed as though they liked me but made comments often about how I should dress more modestly, not wear makeup, not listen to certain music etc. So I have always felt a slight strain in our relationship but I always tried to be respectful and kind to them.  

About two years ago, I was due to give birth. My parents-in-law volunteered to help around the house while I was recovering in the hospital. I had to stay three days due to a complicated birth. When I got home, I noticed they changed so much in my home. There were new pictures on my walls, my cups and other dishes were moved as well as my coffee maker, even my clothes (under garments included) were re-organized. I was certainly annoyed but I was just happy to be home and healthy with my new baby. Honestly some days went by before I noticed it was missing. I have displayed in my back hallway a beautiful ouija board. But not just any ouija board, a hand-carved piece made from my great-grandfather. The piece and even the display case were missing. I checked everywhere I could possibly think of, but it was nowhere to be found. I immediately demanded my husband call his parents and question its whereabouts. They of course claimed they had no clue to what he was referring to but did offer some scripture on occult items. 

This ouija board was very special to me. In my family we don't have any family heirlooms but we have this ouija board. My ancestors settled in the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina. Not much is known about them, as they lacked documentation and a lot of the stories about them have become more fiction than truth. The story says that my great grandfather wished to speak to someone he loved who passed away. One night a storm came and lightning struck a tree and he used that wood to craft the ouija board. I have no way of telling if that is fact or fiction. 
 
However, I know my grandmother was a spiritualist and did make use of the ouija board. And because she died on the day I was born my Aunts decided I should take possession of the board. Ever since I was old enough to take care of it I have. I don’t know if I believe in the use of the ouija board, but I know not to play with it. 
	
With that being said, that is the issue I have with them. They threw away a priceless family heirloom in the trash (I assume that's where they put it). They have tried on occasion to reach out to me and “get the family together” but I don’t want to until they at the very least admit to what they did. My husband thinks I should move on. But it still upsets me. Am I wrong?

To give back story, I was in a very bad relationship a few months prior to when we got together and it had really messed me up. To be honest I was already dealing with resurfaced depression and I had very low self worth. I made some mistakes in the last relationship and do acknowledge I was a big part of the problem to, and since been on a war path of self improvement. 

When I met my current bf he was so sweet and positive and just over all a kid person. He still to this day always takes my trash out and roomates does all of our dishes and no matter time will get fully dressed and go down to get me full meals or drinks. Our relationship at the beginning was rocky because he wanted to be with me asap but I wanted to slow into it and try not to rush things (this was a big issue on my end with my last relationship). Well… I messed up and told parents early and told them he was Muslim (I’m catholic). They told me they don’t think it will last but can’t control me and to just respect their wishes and not “rub him in their faces”. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST WITH BF. About this, and my depression, and about little about my last bf/ old friendships that left me traumatized, and about anything I could think of that could potentially come up in our relationship. He took it fine at first and said he was chill but than started getting sad and bringing my family up when we fought. This was all past stuff that has calmed down in the last 5/6 months. 

Now onto the real topic. Ik I can pick dumb frights and at first I would and he would just call me out and than we would move on. Very direct no arguing just facts. But than he started on this “I’m sorry, but excuses excuses” and these excuses where usually him blaming me for not “knowing his mind/what he was thinking” or random things like “I didn’t make you coffee because it’s raining” like what does rain have to do with an indoor task? Ik my fault lies in where if he apologizes immediately I will know he has no idea why I’m mad or Im not satisfied by how quick the argument ended and still have girl rage and I will keep saying things like “no you always do this you never listen to me”. But AS SOON AS THIS MAN BRINGS AN EXCUSE OUT my rage intensifies and red flags go off because it makes me feel like I am being gas lit. I start calling out the excuses and he will defend and even leave and sleep in his car coming in and out sulking to get me to cave.  He will eventually get really mad and say “I hate I ruined your day we were so close” and I will reassure him that I had a great day but want to address the continuous pattern of making excuses. And he will ignore me and go back to a different issue about me saying how what I’m mad about was nothing compared to things I have done and he doesn’t care about. (Ex be fight over cup on coaster, I say smt he throws excuse I double down he than doubles down than we fight I call out pattern he brings up different story and blames me as reasoning, than mention how it got so intense over a cup and I will say it’s not about cup but the patter of excuses. If it’s not that deep than why defend it?” AND THIS IS TRUE WHY DEFEND IT? He will say he doesn’t care or that he is not in the wrong and make these slugs about my character, family, political party, or race( I’m white and will say things like “ik ur a white girl but stop cring” or “ofc you think that way your whole family is white” but like… if anything I acknowledge that my parents have a like that white people racist fear towards other ethnicities but my sisters uncles grandparents all are very different. 

Whenever he says these things I tell him he knows I don’t have the same views and he is aware that I have fought about him and even has my collage fund treated if I stayed with him, yet in times of anger accuses me of not doing enough because he hasn’t met them. 

Now things are coming to ahead. We are both transferring to the same school and currently will spend 5-6 days together. The issue is as soon as he leaves he will instantly no longer want to come back and see me like he boasts and talks about leading up to his departure and will call me 20 min after saying he wants to say home to play video games. I don’t care if this is what he wants but will than stay home for about 4-5 days before coming back to me. This has given me huge separation anxiety and i literally can’t be happy or I feel like I can’t breath and my heart is tight until I see him. It doesn’t help that when I express to him how I feel when he makes a big talk of things only to cancel and not only that but not text or respond as much and be more indifferent to me is what bothers me not that he wants to stay home. His words cause excitement only for him to crush it. He seems to be getting more and more frustrated with our quips and at this point I feel like he only likes my face/ body and not me anymore. I think he thinks I’m too much and hope I leave him. I just miss my old happy/ overly positive and optimistic bf that always tried to make good a situation. How he just says “I’m sry you feel that way but I don’t think I’m in the wrong” 

Psa: I forgot to add in here that yes, my depression gets worst when we fight whitch is constantly but I purposefully would not bring it up because I felt like that was manipulative and I wanted him to be honest and express himself. But he told me to no matter what but now when I do weather it’s ab him or not he doesn’t hold me or say it’s okay instead just says I should talk about my self like that till he gets mad and says I shouldn’t cry this much. Plz help idk how to fix this relationship. Ik how toxic it sounds but I want him to feel like he can express himself but I also want him to grow back into the man who would listen and try and find compromises and understanding.",2,1744593522.0,AITAH,7,0.75,False

1jyn37t,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1jyn37t/reese_loses_more_subscribers_and_some_of_her/,Reese loses more subscribers and some of her chatters get into an argument,"Relatable Reese has lost even more subscribers. Her channel is down to 19.4K now. One of Reese Quibell's top-tier members says that she needs some hair-styling advice on their next Zoom call. Reese says she'll bring her hair products out and they'll do that.   
  
Reese says she took H to a rec center where he enjoys working out. Her chat should take notice that Reese has still not said one word about H starting the baseball lessons that her fans donated thousands of dollars for him to take. Then they went to eat at Cracker Barrel. Reese says she doesn't really like that restaurant, but she loves the store inside of it. Reese shows a Fleetwood Mac coffee mug that she bought there today and then she says that she doesn't want any more coffee mugs. She claims she only spent $2 on it and that she also found a gift for her mom there that was 50 percent off.   
  
Reese claims she doesn't shop nearly as much as she used to. If that's true, I can't imagine how much stuff she used to bring home when she was married to Jeff.   
  
She says she's loving her new Facebook group and that some people who have written hateful things about Reese in other places are already trying to get in there and her mods are banning and blocking them immediately. She asks why anybody would want to be part of a group they don't like. It's rich that Reese is saying that after she bragged about going into private Facebook groups for Scientology moms, taking tons of screenshots and then doxxing and making fun of a lot of Scientologists on her channel. She did that on Aaron's channel and Natalie's channel too. She's such a hypocrite.   
  
Reese says a lot of people are posting their own pictures and pictures of their kids in her new Facebook group. A chatter asks if she posts a picture of her nieces and nephews in that group if Reese can guarantee that the picture won't get leaked somehow. She says her brother and sister in law don't want pictures of their kids on social media.

Reese tells her she can't guarantee that anything in her Facebook group will stay private because some people have leaked screenshots from her first Facebook group. Reese warns her chat that if they write anything in a text message or say something on a phone call, they should be prepared for it to go public. ""Don't trust anybody,"" she says. Again, Reese was the one in SPTV who started the trend of playing secret recordings and showing private screenshots. Reese's former friends and former mods understand very well how dangerous and manipulative Reese is with private information.   
  
Reese says something awful happened this morning and she put her life in danger to save someone else's life. She says she looked across a field and saw her cat Moose chasing a chipmunk. There was an electric fence between Reese and Moose and she says she was screaming at him in just a T-shirt and underwear. Reese says she has new neighbors who saw her dressed like that. She claims there was a gap in the electric fence so she laid on the ground to slide under the fence. Then she runs across the field that had a lot of bulls.   
  
""I'm an altercation addict,"" she says. Then she claims that her critics make up all kinds of crazy shit about her and some people believe it.   
  
She says she got Moose away from the chipmunk and her neighbors saw her ""with my FUPA flapping in the wind."" She claims she dragged Moose back through the gap in the electric fence with her. Reese says she's a hero and a true country girl now. Then she starts looking for security camera footage of her squeezing under the fence and running through the field. She says it bothers her that she has seven security cameras around her house but that none of the cameras caught her heroics this morning.

Then she shows a couple of very short, blurry clips that look very boring of her just carrying Moose wearing long boyshorts. ""They almost look like shorts,"" she says. She says those clips are proof that her story is true. She thinks the chipmunk died later anyway.   
  
Some of her chatters get into an argument because one of them accuses another of being in someone else's chat shit-talking Reese. Reese says people are free to watch other channels ""and this is not a cult."" She claims that people can come into her chat and challenge her and that her mods won't ban chatters like that. Reese says people are allowed to be in her chat and be friendly toward her and then go into someone else's chat and call Reese a piece of shit.   
  
Reese says her mom has often told her that she's not going to be for everyone. She says her mom told her today ""Wasn't I right?"" and that she told her mom that no, she wasn't right and that no one is right for everyone. Reese says she's learned to let people be wrong about her and that's life-changing.   
  
She claims she doesn't pay attention to any criticism about her but that she's heard a few things this week about people who have whole storylines about how certain things happened with her. Reese says those storylines are not true but she can't do anything to change what people are saying. She's trying to undermine the video that Chabbi's did without pointing her fans directly to it.   
  
Reese claims that talking about her haters helps other people. She reads part of an email from a fan who says if she ever gets friends again, she hopes they will be like Reese. The fan says she has been abused by people and she cares too much about what others think and Reese helps her with that. Reese says people try to gain control over others by being mean and she's speaking out against that.

Reese says Jeff's ex-wife posted in her new Facebook group that three blessings came out of her marriage to Jeff and they are her two daughters and Reese. Wanda thanks people in Reese's Facebook group for being so supportive of Reese because she says Reese has gone through a lot of trauma.   
  
Someone claiming to be an ex-Scientologist sends Reese a superchat and says that Reese's channel is the only ex-Scientologist's channel they want to be a part of. Reese says that's such an honor. Reese cries reading the comment of another fan who says that Reese's community has helped her through chemotherapy, her son's death and other hardships. ""That's what this community is,"" Reese says.   
  
Reese holds Moose up and says he's a criminal ""just like his father."" She's talking about Tommy and says he should reach out and give her child support. Tommy wanted to take Moose to Arizona and Reese wanted to give Moose away for a long time but as soon as Tommy broke up with her, she refused to give Moose to him. She tells Moose that Tommy doesn't give a shit about him.   
  
She says she wants her chatters to help her pick a city so they can all do a meet-up.",2,1744593341.0,OT42,0,0.67,False

What am I to do now?,"I came from Delta, doing the 1K status match from Diamond.   The Delta plebs (/s) over at r/delta said I would be back.  They were wrong.  United has won me over.  The only thing that I wish I could do is add the miles I earned on other airlines to my United Million Miler status.   How cool would it be to celebrate that?   

United Clubs are on par with Skyclubs, outside a few things missing like snacks like chips, ice cream, and the custom meals, but overall isn't much different when you shake it out.   I wish the Coffee had the flavors but it's all good.   

United does the grab-and-go stuff way better.  I love the fact that at IAH, I can get warm food made.  The pretzels are a hit with me just need Chicago-style Polish/German beer cheese.  The space at IAH grab and go is fantastic and what Delta should have rolled out with instead of the closet at ATL B terminal.  

United has better quality flights and times, but the internet can be hit or miss, and hopefully, with Starlink this year, that will drastically improve over the next 90 days and beyond.   Non-Skywest flights have the best internet and Skywest continues to show they don't care with 56K modem service on the majority of their flights.   (It was the same with Delta) 

Delta makes itself out to be the premium carrier, but I don't really see it.  United is absolutely on par with Delta in my opinion.   United has won me over, and I'm happy I made the move as I have more flexibility.  

I hope to take my wife to Paris sometime this summer or in the fall.   I hope to give Polaris a shot then.   I got upgraded to Delta One and that was fantastic, from JFK to LAX.   

Now I have to figure out what to do with my Delta Skypesos and what I am going to use those on.   I have a lot of points I need to use up and probably won't use it for airfare.  Disney Tickets? Hotel for Disney Land for a few days?   I got to figure that out.   Thank you, United for the great experience!  ",16,1744593193.0,unitedairlines,1,0.81,False

* Allergic to small talk. It's a special kind of hell. Phone calls, too. Shoot me now. I'm happy to send voice messages on occasion though. It's actually preferred when I'm in the middle of things.

* I love to read. I'm currently reading the 48 laws of power, and a thieves world novel. I have books all over the place and I'll read almost anything. My to-read pile is over 200 books and counting, because I'll probably add more tomorrow. I usually do. It's almost as tall as me (I'm 6'2"") and I affectionately call it Book Mountain(tm). Yes, it's a problem. No, I'm not stopping. Books are life. And coffee.

* I love writing code and collect old programming books, particularly ones related to games and graphics. I feel like I'm in my element when I'm creating something and watching it evolve over time, especially if it's for a retro system. There are moments when I'll stop and think just how happy I am, while feeling a sense of euphoria and belonging, which I don't really get doing anything else. I haven't done it for a while and I really miss it. I feel out of touch with an important part of me.

* Trying to learn German and Arabic on Duolingo. Failing. Hard.

* I experience social anxiety and sometimes depression. I'm a big fan of exposures and not hiding from how I feel, despite the intense need to sometimes; we don't grow if we don't face ourselves. I think I'm my biggest obstacle in life purely because of some patterns I'm stuck in, but I also think I'm my best asset, purely because I recognize I can change things if I really want to. I try to be responsible for how I feel.

* I love art, Zdzislaw Beksinski and H.R. Giger are favourites. Street and ANSI art, too. Life is art.

* Big fan of 90s and 80s games. C64 anyone? If it was released in the past 10 years, I probably haven't played it.

* I'm not into manga, anime, super hero movies, comics, Disney or JavaScript. It's cool if you are though, you do you. Recommend me a manga and I'll try it when I'm feeling adventurous. Maybe :P. I did go through a kdrama period though, so there's that.

* I hike and I'm one of those people that take random photos during my day; flowers, fungi, books etc. If we hit it off, be prepared for photos :D I like sharing, it's fun. You're more than welcome to share too, though it's not expected.

* I'm a quiet idealist (and dreamer) who's usually lost in the idea of what could be, instead of being down in reality because reality sucks. I want to aim high and strive for what could be. I usually fail or when I get there it doesn't quite look how I envisioned it to be, but I have no regrets.

* I write on occasion (doesn't everyone?). Usually bad poetry, flash fiction or smut.

* Lover of clouds & sunsets, the shadows cast by leaves during the evening sun, people watching, petrichor, birds, and the euphoria of doing something I love. Summer storms are pretty great too.

I was at my local coffee shop, just hanging out and doing my thing. While chatting with the barista, she mentioned that her boyfriend had tried to join the Air Force but got denied because he has braces. I honestly didn’t know that was even a disqualifier, but I shrugged and replied, “Yeah, fuck that—right now’s a horrible time to join the service anyway.”

Well, there was this dude in his early sixties standing behind someone in line, just waiting. When it was his turn to order, he glanced over at me and said, “Are you a veteran?”

Let me give you a little context here—I’m a heavily tattooed veteran, with ink that makes my military affiliation pretty damn obvious, all the way down to my knuckles.

So I said, “Yes sir.”

Then, with this smug little tone, he asks, “Oh yeah? What did you serve in?”

I replied, “I was green-side Navy, sir. What about yourself?”

He lit up and proudly said, “I was in the Air Force. That’s why I asked—because you were talking shit about the Air Force.”

I immediately corrected him:
“Sir, you weren’t part of the entire conversation, so you wouldn’t know—but I was *not* talking shit about the (ch)Air Force. I was pointing out that *right now*, given the political climate, enlisting in the military is a really volatile choice.”

Trying to ease the tension, I asked what he did. He replied in this agitated tone, “I was a loadmaster for 17 years. In the ’90s. Probably before you were even born.”

I said, “Well, I was born in ’93—so not really.”

As he walked out, he muttered, “Yeah, so stop talking shit about the Air Force.”

I just laughed and said, “Yeah buddy, okay.”

The whole thing was just bizarre. This old man felt the need—*and somehow the right*—to weigh the value of his service (during peacetime, no less) over mine. But whatever. I didn’t respond like an asshole, even though I wanted to. What I *wanted* to say was:
**“Buddy, I’ve had to do things for this country that you only have wet dreams about from your fucking office.”**

But I didn’t. Time’s on my side. Fuck him.",361,1744592792.0,BoomersBeingFools,46,0.98,False
1jymx27,https://i.redd.it/cb5xcyhx2pue1.jpeg,How a Trip to Italy Brewed an Obsession,"Earlier this year, we traveled to Italy, spending five days in Florence and Tuscany, followed by five days in Campobasso, where my family is from. We enjoyed some incredible coffee throughout the trip, but Anima Caffè in Campobasso stood out as something truly special. When we returned home to Texas, we ditched our K-Cup machine and picked up a De'Longhi 3630 along with a J-Ultra hand grinder.

Four months later, here's where we are. Last week, we upgraded the De'longhi to an ECM Classika. I still love and use the J-Ultra, but my fiancée was not enjoying the effort required for hand grinding, so we decided to get a Specialita.

We have only been using this setup for a week, but I can say we are pulling some amazing shots. The ECM has exceeded expectations, both in performance and in aesthetics. It is just as much a piece of art on the counter as it is a great espresso machine.

If I had to mention one downside, it would be that the built-in shot timer disappears faster than you can look at it after pulling your shot. 

I am using the stock bottomless portafilter and baskets, Nicoletti beans from Brooklyn, and some ANCAP cups I found secondhand, still in their original boxes.

On a side note, A few days after setting up our new gear, I had a conversation with my father. He told me that my Nonno (my grandfather) was crazy about his espresso. Growing up, the only time I ever had espresso was during visits to my grandparents, but I was too young to really appreciate it. I’d usually drown it in sugar just to get through it. We lost my grandfather during the COVID pandemic, but that conversation with my dad made me reflect on how much we take for granted as kids. I found myself wishing I could go back, taste one of my grandfathers shots, and truly enjoy it with him.",9,1744592785.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I think I accidentally did this to myself and it is less pleasant than you might imagine (as did I). Nonetheless, it could be a legitimate path for some who can't control their eating.

I've been living the nomad lifestyle on a tight budget without many amenities which lead to drinking a lot of milk (which I love) and a lot of Starbucks visits (and I love coffee). It turns out that milk is full of iodine (the precursor for T3 and T4) and caffeine stimulates the thyroid gland. I still need to get blood work to confirm, but regardless, it is a biohacking conversation. Can you induce hyperthyroidism by diet?

After experiencing all the symptoms, I tell you I'd rather be fasting to lose weight; however, I know many would not agree. That said, after reaching my goal weight hyperthyroidism really sucks IMHO.

So half a gallon of milk a day and other iodine sources (300+ mcg/d) plus 1,500 mg caffeine a day for several months... What are the odds this induces hyperthyroidism? Or is this coincidental? And how realistic is it this can be controlled and is temporary if a path to induce it? And am I f****d?",0,1744592691.0,Biohackers,44,0.25,False

Not because I’m picky in the usual way, but because I notice the smallest behaviors and start connecting dots before there are even lines. I don’t mean to. It just happens. And once I see something that feels like it could become a pattern, I can’t unsee it.

There’s this guy I’ve been spending time with. He’s sweet, gentle, and easy to talk to. But he does this thing—I don’t even think he realizes it—where he subtly pushes discomfort onto me. One time, the coffee machine wasn’t working and he went, ‘You should tell the manager :)’ Another time, people were being loud in the study room, and he turned to me and said, ‘It's bothering me as well. You’re a teacher, go tell them.’ When we passed a man with a dog I’d seen locked up, he asked, ‘Why didn’t you say something to him?’

It’s small, I know. But my brain registers it like a red flag waving quietly. If he always expects someone else to take responsibility for uncomfortable situations—even tiny ones—what would that look like in a relationship? In conflict? In crisis?

I wish I could ignore things like this. I wish I could lean into the softness and connection instead of constantly scanning for signs that something will one day feel heavy or unbalanced. But I do. I overthink. I zoom in. I calculate emotional labor before it’s even mine.

And maybe that keeps me safe. But it also keeps me alone.",1,1744592618.0,self,4,0.6,False
