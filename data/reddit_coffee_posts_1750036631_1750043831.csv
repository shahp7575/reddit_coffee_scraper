1lcijxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1lcijxu/eating_soyyay_or_nay/,Eating soy-yay or nay?,"Hi everyone. 

I’m trying to really start looking into my diet and cleaning up things that aren’t the best for PCOS. I do love a lot of soy based products (tofu, soymilk, edamame) and I thought the estrogen produced by soy would be good for us, but I went on google to check and there seems to be mixed opinions. 

Mostly I like to use organic soymilk in my coffee (Malk brand, just soy, water, and salt) and sometimes snack on roasted edamame (not organic but nongmo certified). 

Is this okay or should I switch to a different milk? ",1,1750043766.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False
1lcij3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1lcij3w/customer_decided_to_complain_for_15_minutes_about/,Customer decided to complain for 15 minutes about sugar,"This customer comes in with an aluminium keep cup, asking for a large flat white with two raw sugars. I was taking his order, and at first he was a but condescending, saying, “I have to keep on top of you guys…this NEEDS to be preheated.”

I assured him we would preheat his cup. I always preheat keep cups, but I can’t speak for my coworkers’ practices. Anyway, there were only three of us on FOH at the time. My other two coworkers I was with speak English as a second language, so they can hold a conversation just fine, but occasionally, there are some misunderstandings.

Anyway, the barista on bar was making his drink, I went off to polish glasses which is close to the machine and where we call out drinks. The man is standing there and stops her as she’s putting in two sugar sachets. He starts questioning her about why she’s using that instead of our usual syrup pump. I didn’t know this at the time, and this was my first time meeting this customer, but he’s a regular that’s been coming for the past two years, and so the barista had been taught by someone else to use sugar sachets in his coffee. Clearly, this was his first time picking up on it, so whatever problem he had was just made up in his head cause he wanted something to complain about.

My coworker starts getting nervous and tries to go back to the machine and keep her distance as the man was being quite confrontational. Eventually, he turns to me and starts complaining about his coffee and asks why she put sachets in instead of the cane sugar syrup. I said, “I put the order through as a flat white with two sugars.”

He then goes on to rant about how it isn’t the same sweetness and how one sugar sachet isn’t equivalent to one pump of our sugar syrup and that he’s observed us use the sugar syrup so why are we changing it now… Said it wasn’t sweet enough. I told him that there were sugar sachets sitting on the bench there if he wanted to add a bit more. Throughout his rant, he was constantly sighing, rolling his eyes, would pause for a few moments here and there and give me this stare like he was expecting something from me. He replied that the sugar needed to be dissolved in the espresso as it has a different flavour as opposed to being dissolved afterwards. Right, because apparently an old man like him can tell the difference when he’s having two sugars in his coffee.

So, naturally, I offered to remake it for him if that was the case. He then said no because he didn’t want to be wasteful. But then he continued to complain about the sugar and asked me if I’d ever measured a level teaspoon compared to one of the sugar sachets, blah blah blah. He asked, “But why did she suddenly use the sachets instead?”

I genuinely didn’t know, because I didn’t know that’s what she had been taught to do for this guy. I didn’t want to bring her into it, though, because she and our other coworker kept looking over at me concerned because this guy kept on trying to have a go at us through me. I said, “I think there was just a misunderstanding, but we’re more than happy to fix it up for you. Otherwise, I can refund your drink. Or if you don’t want to be as wasteful, I can dissolved some sugar in espresso, tip out a bit of your drink and add that with some more milk.”

I provided this man with more solutions than I thought I could come up with. One of them should have been to tell him to just piss off home. He keeps going on about how we’re “supposed to know good coffee”, and I just repeated that we made a mistake, many of our staff are new and still in training. He then called out the she wasn’t new here and that she wasn’t in training because he’d seen her before. Yeah, OK, because you’ve clearly worked hospitality before and know what our training period is. Shut the f*ck up. Obviously not something I said. Wish I did. At this point, I wasn’t smiling, but I didn’t want to just walk off in the middle of a customer complaint, because I didn’t want that to come back on me from management if this guy made a complaint about me later on.

He continues complaining and eventually says, “Look, we’re just wasting time. Could you just remake it?”
I was in genuine disbelief. I grabbed the cup from him and said, “Yeah, mate, we are wasting time. You just wasted fifteen minutes of my time after I offered multiple times to remake your drink.”

The barista then comes up to me as I’m washing out his cup at the sink and apologises. And I told her, “No, don’t apologise, you haven’t done anything wrong. He’s the one with problems.”

I was very surprised when he actually thanked me afterwards. Fast forward about ten minutes, one of the warehouse workers comes to me and enlightens me a bit on the situation about how they’ve been trying to jump on the chance to get rid of this customer because he’s a nuisance that only harasses women. Was nice to hear him and the coffee techs come to me and tell me that they’ll back me up if I tell this guy to get lost; if management were to try to get on my ass about it.

TLDR: Sexist asshole spent 15 minutes complaining about nothing and refused all solutions given to him so that he could continue to complain about nothing.",1,1750043692.0,barista,0,1.0,False

1lcihtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1lcihtm/have_you_thought_about_leaving_my_son/,Have you thought about leaving my son?,"He looked at me for all of ten seconds before he knew. Not the surface kind of knowing—the polite head tilt, the concerned murmur. This was the kind that comes from years of quietly watching someone unravel thread by thread while others pretended not to see it. This time, he didn't look away, though. 

Every muscle in my body froze.
Heart thudding, blood rushing in my ears. 
Eyes locked on the man across from me - the father of the man who had slowly, methodically erased me. 
Shock, grief, and relief tangled in my throat like barbed wire. Shock because what do you do when someone finally sees the pain written all over your face, without asking to see proof of the lashes and bruises? Grief for the years I'd lost to silence. Relief that someone had finally dared to say out loud and name what I had lived. Relief that came too late to undo the damage, but just in time to save the sliver of what little was left of me, like a flickering flame close to being extinguished. 

Sometimes, a single question drops into your life like the crackle of thunder shattering the silence of darkness. No amount of preparation prepares you for the impact of such a question. Two years ago, across a table weight down by fear and silence, this question was launched into the world like a grenade into the life I was suffocating in, detonating the existence that sought to destroy me. Two years ago, sitting across from a man I now simply call Dad, these words came out and changed everything. 

Say it out loud and feel the world tilt—because it's not just any man asking: it's his own father. A father-in-law asking his daughter-in-law to abandon his own blood—an act so rare it burns with defiance and truth. Everything in me shattered—not because I hadn't thought about it, but because someone finally said it out loud. And not just someone: ***his own father.***

There was no judgment, no preamble. Just that. He didn't blink, nor walk it back. Just let the silence stretch—honest, steady, brutal in its clarity, spoken with such poise that all the noise inside my head finally stilled. There was no defense of his son. No minimizing. No hollow excuses about stress or upbringing or the complexities of marriage. 
Just truth spoken with quiet courage—
That I deserved love that didn't hurt. A home that didn't feel like a battlefield. Peace that didn't have to be earned through suffering. 

Two years ago, this question crashed through silence like a grenade launched into a room stacked with broken bones. Tears came—unbidden and fierce—the kind that spill when the heart, long burdened, finally finds a voice. A voice that sees the hidden wounds, the silent battles fought behind closed doors. 
Tears fell before words could form and without permission — not from weakness, but from the unbearable release of years spent bleeding in silence, bruised by love turned violent, terror chained deep inside flesh and soul. Not from fear—but from the overwhelming relief of finally being seen, understood, and believed. That moment detonated the world I was suffocating in. Instead of turning away, he reached out—telling me I deserved better—love, respect, peace. A story of watching from the sidelines—witnessing hurt and neglect, and choosing to reach out with compassion and truth.

Living that nightmare alone was torture slow enough to kill you piece by piece—a poison seeping through every waking second. Living with him was slow, methodical murder - every day another piece chipped away, every night another scream swallowed in darkness, a nightmare so suffocating it carved hollows in my soul. To hear those words from the father of the man who shattered me was nothing less than violent grace—a savage rescue in the middle of a war I thought I'd already lost. And then, that voice - unexpected, fierce, real - the father of the man who broke me. His words slammed into my chest, ripping open wounds and healing them all at once. Just a blazing, savage fire tearing down the walls of my prison. 

How many families can survive fracture like that? How many men can stand in the rubble of their son's cruelty and still say: ***she is my daughter.***

The question wasn't betrayal, though. It was salvation that wrecked me in the best way possible, and the most painful, beautiful, and kindest mercy I had ever been gifted. And in that moment, something inside me—something buried under years of gaslight and grit—began to breathe again. It was the most painful mercy I'd ever been gifted, and cracked something open within me that I didn't even know was still alive inside me. 

And then came the promise—the shock of it, dark, fierce, and ironclad: an offer to stand with me in a courtroom, against his own son. To claim me as his own daughter, no matter the blood spilled between us. No hesitation, no denial, just a roaring, unforgiving love that tore apart the cage I'd been trapped in. 
The moment detonated my world. A love so wild, so utterly unexpected, it ripped apart the twisted script of family loyalty and rewrote it in fire. 

That night was more than just a conversation,
And more than just a simple meal and ordinary dinner. It was a battle cry and lifeline—an invitation to step into the light, to reclaim a story stolen by silence and fear. From drowning in shadows and silence, to clawing for every ragged breath. From being erased to burning bright with the first flare of freedom. From suffocation to raw, gasping breaths. From invisibility to a screaming blaze of recognition. From a nightmare that almost swallowed me whole to the first fierce pulse of freedom. From being buried alive in silence to clawing out of the grave with raw, bleeding hands. From shadow to fierce light. 
It was reckoning and resurrection—a brutal birth of a life clawed back from the edge. That night gave me permission to choose myself. To find strength when I thought none was left. To believe in a future where I could heal and be whole again.  

Because of him, survival became a roar, not just a whisper. Because of him, love became rebellion. Because of him, scars turned into armor. In a world that demanded silence, he gave me permission to speak. In a family that expected loyalty, he gave me freedom. In a moment that could have shattered me, he became my shield. This kind of love is a revolution - a father who chooses truth over tradition, courage over comfort, justice over bloodline. A love so wild, so utterly unexpected, it ripped apart the twisted script of family loyalty and rewrote it in fire. 

Because of him, a soul that should have been crushed roars alive with defiance. Because of him, survival became a roar, not just a whisper. Because of him, love became rebellion. Because of him, scars turned into armor. Every step forward is a war carved into the earth. Because of him, the spirit meant to be crushed roars alive. Every step forward is carved from the wreckage in a war for life. This life is mine - raw, bleeding, savage, reclaimed from the ruins of nightmare. Nobody expects to find safety in the father of the man who hurt them. Yet, that is what I found. But it wasn't just safety, not just understanding, but something fiercer: 

Allegiance.

Since then, his presence has been a quiet flame—warming my courage and resolve, steadying and guiding my steps forward, shaping the woman I am becoming—stronger, braver, whole. This man—who once had every reason to walk away—stayed. And not only stayed—but stood beside me with open arms and an unwavering heart. This man not only loved me through the unraveling, but into the rebuilding. This man chose to love me not as his son's wife, but as his daughter in his own right. My father's love reminds me that love doesn't need permission, that family can be chosen, and that healing begins with being seen.

These words rage like fire beneath my skin. A lifeline when the ghosts of history try to claw me back beneath the surface again. A wary cry shattering the silence trying to drag me under again and kill me. A brutal, bleeding reminder that love - wild, merciless, unyielding - can shatter every chain and forge a throne from ashes. A brutal, bleeding reminder that love - fierce, relentless, merciless - can break every chain and build a kingdom from the wreckage. 

Several months later, 
When the separation came,
Once the rings had come off,
And once the settlement agreement was signed, 
I walked into his home alone,
Without a husband in tow,
Nor any accompanied shame or guilt. 
He hadn't disappeared,
And instead, he opened the door like nothing had changed,
Just a quiet welcome and a cup of coffee,
Like it was the most natural thing to love someone after they'd left your own child. 
Because some people understand what love really is.
It isn't blind.
It isn't tribal.
It isn't afraid to sever blood to protect the innocent. 

Not every rescuer wears a uniform. 
Sometimes, he wears a baseball hat,
Drinking his coffee in silence, 
Carrying the quiet sadness only a father who sees his son clearly can,
Choosing truth over silence,
Choosing decency over denial. 
And that kind of love - the fierce, bone-deep, world-turning kind that comes when you've given up hope that anyone is coming -
That's the kind that shapes the rest of your life. 

To the man who saw the monster lurking behind closed doors and chose to fight for me: Thank you.
For tearing apart the silence that sought to bury me alive. For standing in the storm when everyone else fled. For not flinching. For staying. For throwing me a rope when I was drowning in a house everything else thought was just fine. The one who didn't flinch. The only one who stayed.

People think family is who you're born to.
Who you stay loyal to.
Who you protect at all costs. 
But blood doesn't make someone family. 
Decency does.
Courage does.
Love that tells the truth, even when it costs everything, does.
And when I needed a father most,
Not to walk me down an aisle,
But to walk me OUT,
He showed up.
Not with a speech,
But with just one question. 
And it saved my life. 

THIS is what fatherhood represents. 
Thank you for choosing me—not out of obligation, but by choice and heart. 
You will always be my dad. 
And I will always, always be your daughter. 
And I'll carry that gift with me, always. ",0,1750043577.0,TwoXChromosomes,0,0.5,False

1lcifu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lcifu9/i_m_tried_to_assert_a_boundary_with_a_friend_f_in/,"I [M] tried to assert a boundary with a friend [F] in a public space, and it ended our friendship. How could I have handled this better?","I know smoking isn’t popular, but this post isn’t really about that. It’s about a breakdown in communication, autonomy, and boundaries between me and a close friend (F), and I want to understand where I might have gone wrong and how to do better next time.

Over the weekend, my girlfriend and I were staying with a friend (I’ll call her Lena). The night before, I mentioned, clearly, that I like to have a cigarette with my coffee in the morning, and my girlfriend concurred that is her favorite breakfast equally. My friend acknowledged this.

The next morning, I asked Lena for a Cafe with a patio. I am not American and most Cafes where I am from allow you to smoke inside. I thought by asking for a cafe with a patio, I made sure I will be able to smoke. Lena took us to a café with a patio. After ordering, we sat outside and only then noticed ""No Smoking"" signs. I expressed that I still wanted to smoke, there was only one other customer, seated far away, and we were outdoors. I said I doubted anyone would care.

They both objected strongly. I didn’t want to cause a scene, so I compromised by moving to a different table, a few steps away from them, and explained that I’d take full responsibility. I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful, I genuinely thought this would separate my actions from them socially. I emphasized that the sign is the café’s rule to enforce, not theirs, and that I’d handle any consequences.

Instead of backing off, both Lena and my girlfriend got up, walked over, and told me again not to smoke. My girlfriend said she’d physically put it out if I lit it. That made me feel extremely parented, humiliated, and micromanaged in public. I felt like a child being disciplined.

I did light the cigarette. But after one puff, I felt so embarrassed by the pressure and how much of a scene it had become that I walked away. They followed, and I asked them to leave me alone. I ended up throwing away the cigarette and the coffee, and I walked back in to ask staff directly. They said they didn’t care at all whether I smoked or not and they mostly enforced the rule when it was busy and they had many regulars who smoked on the patio.

When I returned to the car, I told Lena what the staff had to say about the rule. I told her that I respected her house rules the night before (she told me her landlord is a cop and that it would be disrespectful of me to smoke a cigarette inside or in front of the house and so I had to take a walk for my cigarette), but a public café isn’t her space to govern. She told me she doesn’t want friends who disregard her feelings. I said, bluntly, that I already have three mother figures (adoptive mother, biological and stepmother) in my life, none of which would try to correct me the same way she did so I don’t need a fourth. She cut me off.

Later, she texted my girlfriend saying ""I really hope you are okay. I mean it. If you need anything let me know"", which both of us let like it was a jab at me.

To be clear:

* I **acknowledge** I lit a cigarette in a no-smoking zone, which makes me the AH **on paper**, but this is really not what this post is about.
* This post is really about: Was I an AH for how I stood my ground in that moment?
* Did I mishandle the boundary conversation?
* Should I have prioritized their discomfort even in a public space where I wasn’t putting them in direct harm or breaking a law that anyone cared to enforce?

I want to be better about handling conflicts like this in the future. Where did I fail? Where did Lena overstep, if at all? What would you have done?

1lciezb,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1lciezb/the_voice_in_the_woods/,The voice in the woods.,"We live tucked deep in the Southern Appalachian mountains, in a holler no GPS will find and no outsider wants to stumble into after dark. The kind of place where the woods don’t end—they swallow. There’s a hush to the land out here. The kind of quiet that doesn’t feel empty, just watchful.

It was just past midnight when it happened. A Thursday, I think. The air was still, heavy with the scent of moss and pine, the kind of thick silence that settles over everything once the cicadas burn out. The kids were asleep. My wife had gone to bed an hour earlier, and I stayed behind in the kitchen, sipping bad coffee and scrolling through nothing.

Then I heard her call my name—sharp, afraid.

I moved fast. That’s not how she calls unless something’s wrong. I bolted down the hall toward our bedroom—only to find it empty. The covers pulled back, the lamp still on. My stomach dropped.

Out the window, I spotted her—sitting in our old Jeep, parked just beyond the porch light’s reach. The moon was bright enough to cast everything in silver, and I could see her clearly, wide-eyed, staring out across the yard toward the woods.

That’s when John ran.

He came tearing down the gravel drive barefoot, shirtless, wild-eyed. He didn’t even look at me. Just hit the treeline and vanished into the dark like something was chasing him, or like he was running straight into hell to avoid it.

Then I heard it.

“Hello?”

A child’s voice. Small. Lost. A little girl—no older than six. It floated out from the black edge of the woods, just beyond the first row of trees.

There was something about it—the way it held my name without saying it. The way it cracked just a little at the end, like she was trying not to cry.

I called back, “Hey! Who’s out there?”

The voice answered, same tone. Same softness.
“Hello?”

It wasn’t just an answer. It was an echo—but not mine. It didn’t sound like something trying to be a kid. It sounded like something pretending. And doing it too well.

My wife hadn’t moved. Still frozen in the car, but now she was staring at me. I saw it in her face—the shift. From fear to real fear. Whatever was in those woods, she felt it too.

I motioned her toward the house, and she moved fast. She left the car door open as she sprinted. The moment she passed me, I turned to follow.

That’s when it called again.

“Hello?”

Closer now. Same voice. Too close.

Every inch of my body tightened. My skin knew before my brain did: this wasn’t some lost child. This was a trap. Something trying to get close enough for something worse.

I broke into a sprint. Feet hitting the porch hard, the wood creaking under me. I slammed the front door shut and threw the deadbolt. My wife collapsed against the hallway wall, breathing fast. I didn’t ask questions—I didn’t need to.

We both knew.

Silence. Then—

Scratch.
Low. Deliberate. A slow drag of nails—not fingertips—across the wood just beneath the handle.

Then the voice again. Just on the other side.

“Hello?”

The scratching stopped.

No footsteps. No rustling. Just that brutal silence the mountains keep like a secret. You could’ve heard a mouse shift in the walls—or your own heartbeat cracking in your ears.

We stood still. My wife slid down the wall and curled her knees to her chest. I placed one hand on the doorframe like I was holding it closed with more than just the lock. Truth was, I didn’t trust the bolt. Not with that voice out there.

Out here in the deep woods, you learn to respect what doesn’t make sense.

I checked the time. 1:03 a.m. That meant we had hours before dawn. Hours of shadow. Of not knowing. Of that thing waiting out there. Or worse—circling.

“Should we call someone?” she whispered.

Call who? The county sheriff lives forty minutes away. Cell signal’s a rumor this deep in the holler. Even if we got a bar, what do I say?
“Something’s scratching my door and pretending to be a lost little girl”?

She knew the answer already. She didn’t ask again.

I walked to the back window and peered through the blinds. The treeline lay still. The moon lit up the yard like frost, but past the first dozen trees, it was all ink. That kind of dark where your eyes never adjust. Like the woods weren’t empty—just full of something that knew how to hold still.

And that voice…

It wasn’t gone. Not really. I could feel it, just past the light. Like someone watching you from a place they’ve already memorized.

That’s the thing about these mountains: they know how to listen. They soak up sound. They let your screams die in the hollows and come back to you as whispers. They don’t care if you’re scared.

I pulled the shotgun from above the fireplace. It was loaded. It wouldn’t help.

“Maybe it’s gone,” my wife said. But she didn’t believe it. Her voice was just one more thing to keep the quiet from swallowing us.

I don’t know what time I fell asleep, but I remember the last thing I heard before I did.

A soft tap. Not a knock. Just a test. Like a finger running along glass.

From the kitchen window this time.

Then—

“Hello?”
They say the mountains have rules.

Old ones. Not written down, not spoken often. Just known. If you grow up in these woods—or stay long enough—you learn to keep your porch light on, your curtains closed, and your door locked tight after sunset. You don’t whistle at night. You don’t call back when something calls your name. And above all, you don’t open the door.

We didn’t open the door.

But that thing didn’t leave.

The next few hours blurred into a long, breathless stretch of waiting. The tapping moved—sometimes on the front door, sometimes the windows. Sometimes it circled the house in long, dragging loops. I’d hear it at the kitchen glass…then five seconds later, at the back porch…then, nothing.

Then—

“Hello?”

My wife clutched my hand tight whenever it came close. She didn’t ask what it was. She knew. It wasn’t a child. It wasn’t lost. It was inviting itself in.

At 2:27 a.m., it found the kids’ window.

The first tap was light—like a moth against the glass. Then another. Then three in a row. Rhythmic.

My daughter’s voice floated down the hall. “Daddy?”

I was already moving.

I slipped into the room. She and her younger brother sat up in bed, their eyes wide but calm. They didn’t cry. Didn’t scream. Mountain kids. They’d been raised to respect the dark.

“There’s someone at the window,” she said. “She keeps saying hello.”

I looked. The curtains were drawn. But I felt it. Right there, on the other side.

I motioned them out of the room silently, guiding them to the couch in the living room where my wife had pulled blankets and cushions into a quiet nest.

We didn’t speak. Not because we were afraid to—but because it was listening.

For the next hour, it danced around the house. The voice would disappear, and in its place—silence so loud you could feel it vibrating inside your chest. The kind of quiet that doesn't bring peace. The kind that tells you something's thinking.

Then, around 4:00 a.m., it changed.

No more tapping.

No more “Hello?”

Just a thump. A weight. Something leaning against the front door.

Then—

“Joe.”

The voice didn’t belong to a child anymore.

It was John.

“Joe—man, it’s me. Please. I didn’t know where else to go.”
His voice cracked like a branch splitting under pressure. “Please open the door.”

My hands went numb.

He said my name again. And again. Always with the same rhythm. Same crack. Same tone.

“Please. Please open the door.”

I stared at the deadbolt.

My wife sat upright, her hand trembling now. She shook her head, just once. Hard.

“Joe—I think it broke my leg,” the voice said next. “I think it’s out there somewhere. Please.”

But he didn’t knock.

And he didn’t move.

And that’s how I knew.

Whatever was out there, whatever had chased John into those woods—it didn’t need to find him. It had learned him. Learned his panic, his words, his voice, his fear.

Now it was wearing him.

The kids stared at me, silent. Their faces pale in the candlelight. The tapping had stopped completely.

The voice spoke again.

“Joe?”

It said my name in the same tone the girl had used.

The exact same tone.
Around 4:45 a.m., the woods changed.

Not the way city folks mean when they talk about sunrise—no birdsong, no golden sky. In these mountains, dawn doesn’t arrive. It climbs. It crawls its way up the ridges and slips through the trees like a ghost. And until it crests the ridge behind our house, it’s still night.

The voice hadn’t spoken in half an hour.

That silence was the worst part.

We all sat in the living room, blankets wrapped tight, the kids drowsy but too afraid to sleep. My wife had one hand on my son’s shoulder, her eyes on the door. I hadn’t moved in twenty minutes. Didn’t breathe right. Couldn’t.

It was waiting.

That much I knew in my bones. Not gone. Not walking away. Just waiting for the right shape to wear. The right voice. The final thread.

Then came the whisper.

Not at the window. Not the door. It came from inside.

From the hallway.

Soft. Measured.

“…Daddy?”

My heart stopped.

It wasn’t my daughter.

It sounded like her. But she was asleep, her head in my wife’s lap. I looked down at her—heard the shallow, panicked breath of a child pretending not to be awake.

Another whisper. From deeper down the hall, just around the corner.
“Daddy… can you help me?”

I stood slowly. My wife shook her head again, her grip tightening on the kids.

“I’m stuck,” the voice said. Higher now. Fragile. “I can’t get out.”

I stepped toward the hall. My boots silent on the old pine floor.

“I’m scared.”

Three words. Just three. But they came too smooth. Too rehearsed. Like someone trying not to get the words wrong.

I crept down the hallway, hand tight on the shotgun. I passed the kids’ bedroom door. The sound came again.

“Daddy?”

From the basement door.

That door was always shut. Locked from the inside.

I stood there, breathing slow. My father’s words echoed from a time I hadn’t thought of in years.
""Don’t ever open a door just because something on the other side knows your name.""

I didn’t.

Instead, I dropped to my knees and pressed one ear to the wood.

It went quiet.

Then something scraped, slow and low, just beyond the frame.

Like fingernails on stone.

Then the voice spoke one more time.

“Help me daddy im stuck”
Pleading so close to my daughters voice. But not quite just enough off to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. 

I stood and backed away. Never turned my back on that door.

---

At 6:13 a.m., the first light broke the treetops.

The tapping never returned.

But the woods never went back to normal either.

In the last few months, I’ve created a sort of checklist in my head of things to do before a new week begins. Not all things contribute to making the upcoming week easier, but it just feels like when things are pre-organized or clean, everything else flows better. For example, I deep clean the house as best I can during the day - doing loads of laundry, cleaning floors, cabinets, backsplash, mirrors, bathrooms, taking out all the little trash bins around the house, etc. At night, I refill the coffee maker and tea kettle, put the kids backpacks and snack boxes in the trunk of my car, and load up my work bag and put that in the car too. 

There still seem to be voids. I feel like if I had an actual checklist to follow, it would take less time and I’d be more efficient because I wouldn’t keep trying to remember all the things I did the week before. Also, I want to think of ways to incorporate myself (mental and physical well-being) in this reset. I know I can shower/do my hair the night before and do a little skincare self-love stuff, but who actually has the energy at the end of the day? If you do, please tell me how!

TLDR: Working mom of 2. Wants a Sunday reset checklist to help make Monday start strong so the rest of the week flows better too.

We stood still. My wife slid down the wall and curled her knees to her chest. I placed one hand on the doorframe like I was holding it closed with more than just the lock. Truth was, I didn’t trust the bolt. Not with that voice out there.

Out here in the deep woods, you learn to respect what doesn’t make sense.

I checked the time. 1:03 a.m. That meant we had hours before dawn. Hours of shadow. Of not knowing. Of that thing waiting out there. Or worse—circling.

“Should we call someone?” she whispered.

Call who? The county sheriff lives forty minutes away. Cell signal’s a rumor this deep in the holler. Even if we got a bar, what do I say?
“Something’s scratching my door and pretending to be a lost little girl”?

She knew the answer already. She didn’t ask again.

I walked to the back window and peered through the blinds. The treeline lay still. The moon lit up the yard like frost, but past the first dozen trees, it was all ink. That kind of dark where your eyes never adjust. Like the woods weren’t empty—just full of something that knew how to hold still.

And that voice…

It wasn’t gone. Not really. I could feel it, just past the light. Like someone watching you from a place they’ve already memorized.

That’s the thing about these mountains: they know how to listen. They soak up sound. They let your screams die in the hollows and come back to you as whispers. They don’t care if you’re scared.

I pulled the shotgun from above the fireplace. It was loaded. It wouldn’t help.

“Maybe it’s gone,” my wife said. But she didn’t believe it. Her voice was just one more thing to keep the quiet from swallowing us.

I don’t know what time I fell asleep, but I remember the last thing I heard before I did.

A soft tap. Not a knock. Just a test. Like a finger running along glass.

From the kitchen window this time.

Then—

“Hello?”
They say the mountains have rules.

Old ones. Not written down, not spoken often. Just known. If you grow up in these woods—or stay long enough—you learn to keep your porch light on, your curtains closed, and your door locked tight after sunset. You don’t whistle at night. You don’t call back when something calls your name. And above all, you don’t open the door.

We didn’t open the door.

But that thing didn’t leave.

The next few hours blurred into a long, breathless stretch of waiting. The tapping moved—sometimes on the front door, sometimes the windows. Sometimes it circled the house in long, dragging loops. I’d hear it at the kitchen glass…then five seconds later, at the back porch…then, nothing.

Then—

“Hello?”

My wife clutched my hand tight whenever it came close. She didn’t ask what it was. She knew. It wasn’t a child. It wasn’t lost. It was inviting itself in.

At 2:27 a.m., it found the kids’ window.

The first tap was light—like a moth against the glass. Then another. Then three in a row. Rhythmic.

My daughter’s voice floated down the hall. “Daddy?”

I was already moving.

I slipped into the room. She and her younger brother sat up in bed, their eyes wide but calm. They didn’t cry. Didn’t scream. Mountain kids. They’d been raised to respect the dark.

“There’s someone at the window,” she said. “She keeps saying hello.”

I looked. The curtains were drawn. But I felt it. Right there, on the other side.

I motioned them out of the room silently, guiding them to the couch in the living room where my wife had pulled blankets and cushions into a quiet nest.

We didn’t speak. Not because we were afraid to—but because it was listening.

For the next hour, it danced around the house. The voice would disappear, and in its place—silence so loud you could feel it vibrating inside your chest. The kind of quiet that doesn't bring peace. The kind that tells you something's thinking.

Then, around 4:00 a.m., it changed.

No more tapping.

No more “Hello?”

Just a thump. A weight. Something leaning against the front door.

Then—

“Joe.”

The voice didn’t belong to a child anymore.

It was John.

“Joe—man, it’s me. Please. I didn’t know where else to go.”
His voice cracked like a branch splitting under pressure. “Please open the door.”

My hands went numb.

He said my name again. And again. Always with the same rhythm. Same crack. Same tone.

“Please. Please open the door.”

I stared at the deadbolt.

My wife sat upright, her hand trembling now. She shook her head, just once. Hard.

“Joe—I think it broke my leg,” the voice said next. “I think it’s out there somewhere. Please.”

But he didn’t knock.

And he didn’t move.

And that’s how I knew.

Whatever was out there, whatever had chased John into those woods—it didn’t need to find him. It had learned him. Learned his panic, his words, his voice, his fear.

Now it was wearing him.

The kids stared at me, silent. Their faces pale in the candlelight. The tapping had stopped completely.

The voice spoke again.

“Joe?”

It said my name in the same tone the girl had used.

The exact same tone.
Around 4:45 a.m., the woods changed.

Not the way city folks mean when they talk about sunrise—no birdsong, no golden sky. In these mountains, dawn doesn’t arrive. It climbs. It crawls its way up the ridges and slips through the trees like a ghost. And until it crests the ridge behind our house, it’s still night.

The voice hadn’t spoken in half an hour.

That silence was the worst part.

We all sat in the living room, blankets wrapped tight, the kids drowsy but too afraid to sleep. My wife had one hand on my son’s shoulder, her eyes on the door. I hadn’t moved in twenty minutes. Didn’t breathe right. Couldn’t.

It was waiting.

That much I knew in my bones. Not gone. Not walking away. Just waiting for the right shape to wear. The right voice. The final thread.

Then came the whisper.

Not at the window. Not the door. It came from inside.

From the hallway.

Soft. Measured.

“…Daddy?”

My heart stopped.

It wasn’t my daughter.

It sounded like her. But she was asleep, her head in my wife’s lap. I looked down at her—heard the shallow, panicked breath of a child pretending not to be awake.

Another whisper. From deeper down the hall, just around the corner.
“Daddy… can you help me?”

I stood slowly. My wife shook her head again, her grip tightening on the kids.

“I’m stuck,” the voice said. Higher now. Fragile. “I can’t get out.”

I stepped toward the hall. My boots silent on the old pine floor.

“I’m scared.”

Three words. Just three. But they came too smooth. Too rehearsed. Like someone trying not to get the words wrong.

I crept down the hallway, hand tight on the shotgun. I passed the kids’ bedroom door. The sound came again.

“Daddy?”

From the basement door.

That door was always shut. Locked from the inside.

I stood there, breathing slow. My father’s words echoed from a time I hadn’t thought of in years.
""Don’t ever open a door just because something on the other side knows your name.""

I didn’t.

Instead, I dropped to my knees and pressed one ear to the wood.

It went quiet.

Then something scraped, slow and low, just beyond the frame.

Like fingernails on stone.

Then the voice spoke one more time.

“Help me daddy im stuck”
Pleading so close to my daughters voice. But not quite just enough off to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. 

I stood and backed away. Never turned my back on that door.

---

At 6:13 a.m., the first light broke the treetops.

The tapping never returned.

But the woods never went back to normal either.

I met this girl through friends. It was a real raw spark.. We started bonding and casually planned for things later. There's a quick rapport with a mix of jokes, shared interests, lifestyle choices, and spontaneous humor, all blended in, all of which mix and go at a fast pace, making it wholesome and great.

As time progressed, the dialogue turned flirtatious. And explored personal boundaries, some sexual fantasies and even sensitive topics like kinks. (I'm trying to resume something so emotionally dense in few words that can't explain the connection).

So after waiting for a convenient time to visit each other (we live far from each other) It was due! to start our dating phase! with a first one, that seemed to go well, from planning a coffee and a walk, to hanging out for 6 hours & her wanting me to stay the whole night in her city.

Yet, the one thing that got me off guard, she unexpectedly she introduced me to her sister without prior notice before the date. I wasn’t comfortable with meeting family that early, so at the end of the date, I jokingly said, “I'll meet you in another city where your sister won't be around.”

Yet, as it simmered through next day, things backfired. I tried reaching out several times & got hard-walled. Got consufed. Got ghosted me for a month. Eventually, I spoke to a common friend who told me she took what I said as a very rude saying, and took it as I was only interested in her for sex & hooking up and didn’t care about her at all.

When I heard that, I tried to apologize, I felt guilty, but her response was, “What you said was horrible. I rarely see my family, ofc they are my priority. I completely lost interest.” she got so guarded and my friend told me that she was mad 10/10 on scale, and said “That was a date, the only date"" + ""I absolutely didn’t give a f\*ck about him, that the next day, I went on another date with another guy and I don’t give a single shit about him that he doesn’t even cross my mind.”

It sounds to me like someone mad and disgusted by who I was in their mind, rathen than indifferent. I tried again to express that I still cared, even if it was a short time we knew each other. But after that, she blocked me on 2 social medias that I tried to reach on (2 are open). Now the situation seems dead. I know.

But, I fucking.. can't.. get her.. off my mind.. 3rd month in right now.

The potential is so great that I just wanted to be raw on everything, be truthful rather than ""put my attitude with makeup on"", I didn't mean to offend, just to express a boundary in a playful way to keep it low.

WHAT CAN I DO, I feel so trapped in this.. If I visit her city, shall I try to send a message to just speak things out? Shall I give up? Shall I let time fix things if she felt exposed by my words?? Shall I ask our common friend if my name still triggers her??? What can I do????

PS: she's very attached to her sister, long context, but she got only her sister & mother in her life.",1,1750043089.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

1lciapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1lciapc/how_do_i_stop_being_frequently_bored/,How do I stop being frequently bored?,"Hi, I’m 25F and I have found that I am pretty bored with life. In more ways than one, but I will just keep it to a general boredness for this post.   

I have a variety of interests and hobbies, but I am so familiar with all of them that none of it brings a spark to my life anymore. When I’m at home, I find myself doing the same things that I have been doing since I was a teenager. I watch videos on things that interest me both educational and entertainment, I watch movies or shows that used to bring me joy. Video games sometimes do bring me an intense increase in excitement  when I find a new game to play, but then I end up overplaying it to where that excitement completely dies off and I don’t play it again.

I drink tea and coffee and go to cafes, I have many creative outlets that I actively do like drawing, writing, painting. I have a collection of plants outside that I tend to and garden that I plant flowers in. I used to spend a decent amount of time on social media and while that kept me occupied I’ve decided ultimately it brought me no actual value to my life and I’ve deleted all my social media off my phone so my consumption is way down. I try cooking and baking but I am really not good at it and I don’t find joy in it. I used to like watching things like movies and shows and videos but now it seems like I’ve done it so often throughout my life that it’s so accessible that I don’t even want to watch things anymore even if they’re new. I read books and do sudoku puzzles but they don’t bring me ‘excitement’. 

Ultimately, there’s so many things that I *could* do, but none of them make me feel actual joy or excitement anymore. The spark is completely gone. I go for walks and listen to music, I workout as well, I try journaling and planning things for my life in a healthy way. I am just questioning to myself, is this it? Is this all there is? I’ve done this for almost a decade. What’s next? More and more years of the same routine? I am grateful that I am able to do these things and even question this part of life, but also it’s not a somewhere that I want to be. I want to be able to do all these things again if it made me feel something.

I know probably the next steps would be talking with people and feeling connected with those around me. Well, I wish I could, but unfortunately that’s not really the life I was given nor do I have the skills to do so. I’m estranged from my family. I have one friend that’s been in my life for years and I’m glad I have her, she’s a great person, but I don’t feel that we are very close emotionally. We hangout and I like spending time with her but I don’t feel I can be truly myself around her, and I feel like our time is transactional, both of us are the type of people to be like ‘Oh look at the time, it’s 6 pm well I better get home to make dinner and take it easy’. And honestly, I am such a socially anxious person that even when I do have some chance for a ‘wild night out’ I just feel incomplete when I’m in the moment. It feels like a mask that’s on me and it’s not the real me having fun, just me acting like I’m having fun. It’s hard for me to find and make friends, especially today when so many people are homebodies (even me). I know I’m being hypocritical but I feel stuck in a cursed loop.

I would really love to travel, but modern day is difficult to find time and money for leisure, and someone else to find that time and money at the same time as well. I’ve gone traveling alone convinced nothing could stop me, and each time it was very strange, like I had no one to share these experiences with so it felt lonely.

I don’t mean to sound so pessimistic, I’m normally not a pessimistic person. I just keep catching myself in this state of not actually feeling something anymore, especially at nighttime when I have hours of time to do something anything and I end up not having a want to do any because I’m not excited to. All these hobbies and interests I have, and all these little things I do haven’t been able to bring it back. Any tips? Thanks.

1. Beg my friend (who has been trying to get us together) to set up another drinking occasion or something.
2. Add her to my snapchat contact list. I feel like that would be an easy way to start casually ""messaging""

Next step is EBRT, VMAT 16 sessions, 2.5Gy per fraction. I did the CT simulation about a week ago, they had me do an enema in the morning 2 hours beforehand and then drink 24oz of water 45 minutes before my appointment.

When I got to the appointment they said there was still fecal matter in my rectum and my bladder wasn’t full enough, had me put on a penile clamp and go push out as much poop as I could while holding the pee in using the clamp. It was fairly uncomfortable and I’d rather not repeat this experience. I pooped a little more and they said I was good to go for the sim.

So last week I started practicing my poop/pee schedule in the morning based on my radiation appointment times at 8:30AM. The problem is that I cant for the life of me seem to go poop by the time I need to, my body just will not cooperate. The things I would do to alleviate this normally would be to drink some more water or some coffee, neither of which I can do in this specific situation.

Hi r/espresso,

I never thought I'd get this deep into this world, but after having some insanely good espresso, I'm hooked and really wanna learn. I'm a complete beginner looking for guidance before I start bankrupting myself.

This is my current setup

* Bella Pro Series espresso machine (\~$50)
* Pre-ground Cafe Bustelo (lol)
* Basic tamper and needle distributor

I recently learned the single biggest upgrade I can make is using freshly roasted beans and grinding them right before brewing.

I want to get the 1Zpresso J-Ultra manual grinder ($200) and find quality freshly roasted beans (suggestions welcomed as well). My research suggests the conical burrs in the J-Ultra are great for the full-bodied, creamy, and rich flavors I love, as opposed to a brighter, more acidic taste from flat burrs.

I love that deep, earthy taste. I'm looking for classic, traditional espresso flavors. I definitely don't want beans with artificial flavors. At least I don't think, I honestly don't know what I don't know. But I'm not too big on sweet coffee, I prefer black coffee (if that helps).

* Is focusing on a quality grinder like the J-Ultra the right first move, even with my very basic machine?
* Is the J-Ultra reliable and worth the money?
* What else should I know that I don't know I don't know?

I can afford to invest in decent equipment and I don't mind the workflow of manual grinding. I understand my machine is the next bottleneck, but everyone says ""grinder first."" I just want to make sure I'm starting off on the right foot.

Thanks for any advice!",1,1750041913.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

We have a two year old girl who is awesome and great kid. We have a good marriage but when it comes to holidays I feel it’s lopsided. I always try to think of things outside the box and go above beyond for her when it comes to birthdays and Mother’s Day. I want to show my appreciation for how much she does. However for me it seems like a lack of effort,for example this Mother’s Day I completed a bathroom refresh(what she wanted) using my money. I gifted her a hand created drawing of her and our daughter and gift card to her favorite store. I got up early and let her sleep in, ran out to Starbucks for her(I don’t like coffee) I let her relax all day and took care of all of our toddlers needs so she didn’t have to lift a finger. I truly wanted her to relax. That night I bathed and put our daughter to bed (not unusual for me to do, we split these duties very often but wanted to make sure she could sit and lounge as it’s her day) once bed time was completed I made steak, asparagus, and baked potato. I served her dinner and we just watched a movie and relaxed till bed.

Today(Father’s Day) i get up with the family as normal no sleeping in, I get a few gifs in a target bag because she forgot to get gift bag( not a big deal but she always ensure she has one for everyone) forgot about another small gift until I found a box and asked what it was. my mother-in-law was invited over (not my choice) and comes over for 3 hours, then leaves right before nap time. Once my daughter wakes up we head over to my parents for a few hours, we get home and get our daughter ready for dinner/bath/bed. My wife did majority of it but after bed time, no dinner, no nothing we end up eating cereal and starting a show. 

Am I being ungrateful for the gifts? Am I the asshole for feeling like she didn’t really care? Do I feel this way because maybe I am not doing as much as I thought so she doesn’t actually appreciate me and I should change?",1,1750041591.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.66,False

I’m AJ. I’m 39, I live in Washington State, and I’m looking for someone who’s craving the same things I am: closeness, partnership, and that safe feeling of finally being seen, WITHOUT having to start from scratch.

Let me be upfront: I’m not rich. I’m not tall (5'6""). I live with my parents (I’m an only child, and they’re pretty elderly and require constant care) while also rebuilding after years of mental health struggles, career instability, and loss. I’ve also taken up a side gig as my friend’s personal driver (she’s a high-level flight attendant who doesn’t drive). I’ve been through some heavy things, and I’m still working through them. I don’t have a long dating history. I’ve never had that sweeping, mutual love I always believed I’d find. But I’m still here. Still trying. Still hoping.

I’ve been a musician since I was 16, teaching myself guitar and making beats on pirated software back in the early 2000s. Now I help run a small indie label with a friend. Over the past five years, I’ve released three albums with my current project, where I wrote, sang, and played nearly everything. One of my songs was featured in a short film at the 2022 Tacoma Film Festival. And when I was 18, a project of mine hit the front page of YouTube. (Nothing came of it, but hey, it happened.)

I’m an artist, a writer, a dreamer. I feel things deeply, probably too deeply. I care. I overthink. I love David Lynch films, My Bloody Valentine B-sides, late-night conversations, coffee shops, libraries, compact 35mm cameras, guitars, colognes/fragrances (Bleu De Chanel is my go-to but I never skip the chance to try out stuff I haven't smelled before), Square Enix games, Korean BBQ, diners, cats (I have 2, Max & Boris), and intense music of literally any genre that makes your heart swell. Playlists are sacred. I live about 45 minutes from North Bend, WA (where a lot of Twin Peaks was filmed), and it’s my favorite place in the world. I don’t drink (just weed for me, thanks) and I have a deep respect and reverence for psychedelic mushrooms. (Google Maria Sabina.)

I think a lot about healing — how to soften instead of harden, how to stay open in a world that keeps asking us to shut down. I try to meet life (and people) with curiosity and compassion, even when it’s hard.

Physically, aside from my height, I have long dark hair and blue eyes. I usually get described as “cute” more than “hot” or “handsome” (much to my chagrin). I’m not especially big, but I’ve put time into the gym and even worked at Planet Fitness for a bit (which is... narratively funny if nothing else). I try to dress with intention: think goth clubs, secondhand leather jackets, Nicolas Cage in Wild At Heart. I do my best to carry a vibe.

I’m not perfect, but I’m real. And I’m looking for someone real too: someone kind, open, emotionally present. Someone who values tenderness over polish. Someone who might also be wondering if there’s still time to find their person.

If that’s you, I’d love to hear from you. Tell me your favorite band. Tell me what makes you feel safe. Tell me what you miss.

I can share photos and the usual social media stuff, but I’d really prefer to use Discord (I used to play a lot of Final Fantasy XIV, and it just kind of stuck). Please don’t make me suffer through Reddit’s godforsaken internal messaging system for too long.

I, being a daughter mostly disconnected from her father nowadays, had procrastinated in avoidance of 
 the event and thought I might feel shameful if I didn’t at least turn up with a card. There are many pleasures in life, of the innumerable is any opportunity to order an iced coffee beverage of your choice and walk around the grocery store. 

While walking into the store I found my new shoes didn’t fit well, slipping from the heel on one foot. My gait would be awkwardly strained if I moved too briskly. I stride smoothly and carefully to order my coffee. Beverage in hand, I find myself in an aisle behind an older woman, perhaps in her 60s who was moving at a leisurely pace not conducive to my freshly caffeinated power walk. I felt immediate shame as I rounded past her, occasionally halfway losing a shoe, struggling to move past her in the traffic. 

Feeling humbled, I arrived in the card aisle and pointed my eye towards the picked through, mostly empty section dedicated on a rotating basis to Father’s Day. Feeling apathetic towards my relationship with this figure I wanted to be sure not to select a card that lays the gravy on particularly thick, not wanting him to take this card as some sign of reunification. After darting and later slowly dragging my eyes across the rows of colorful cards I had a disruptive realization; all the cards left are meant for exceptionally great fathers. 

Standing there wondering if I should just go to a different store to find a card the same woman I passed earlier is suddenly standing next to me. She smiled softly, I smiled back while suppressing the shame of my earlier haste. She joked that the picked through shelves were a just reward for daughters who waited so long. We agreed all the good ones must have been long gone. I stifled the impulse to say “it’s easier if you don’t like your father.” I hope she has a good relationship with her father.

## Key Features Analysis

A truly effective teacher survival kit isn’t just a collection of random items; it’s a carefully curated selection designed to address the specific needs of educators. Here's a breakdown of key features to consider when building or buying a kit:

**Hydration Hero:** A High-Quality Water Bottle.

staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining energy levels and overall well-being, something that's often overlooked amidst the classroom chaos. A durable, insulated water bottle that keeps drinks cold (or hot) for extended periods is essential. Look for options made from stainless steel, featuring leak-proof lids, and easy-to-clean designs. A capacity of at least 24 ounces is recommended for a full day of teaching.

**Caffeine Kickstart:** A Reliable Source of Energy.Whether it’s coffee, tea, or energy bars, having a go-to source of energy is a must for battling afternoon slumps. Consider including single-serve coffee pods, individually wrapped tea bags, or a selection of healthy granola bars and protein bites. Opt for options with low sugar content to avoid the dreaded sugar crash. Variety is key to cater to different preferences and dietary needs.

**Organization Oasis:** A Compact Planner or Notebook.

Staying organized is paramount for managing lesson plans, deadlines, and student information.A compact planner or notebook with a durable cover and clear layout can make all the difference. Look for options with monthly and weekly spreads, ample space for notes, and perhaps even sections for student contact information or grading. Digital planners are also a grate option for tech-savvy teachers.

**Sanity Saver:** A Mini Relaxation Station.

Teaching can be incredibly stressful, so incorporating items that promote relaxation and stress relief is crucial. consider including aromatherapy oils (like lavender or peppermint), a stress ball, a calming coloring book with colored pencils, or a small collection of inspiring quotes. These items provide a much-needed mental break during busy school days.

**Germ Warfare:** Hand Sanitizer and Disinfectant Wipes.

Classrooms are breeding grounds for germs.Keeping hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes readily available is essential for preventing illness. Opt for travel-sized hand sanitizer bottles with a high alcohol content and disinfectant wipes that are effective against common viruses and bacteria. Encourage students to use these items as well to create a healthier classroom habitat.

**Wardrobe Malfunction Mitigation:** A Basic Repair Kit.Unexpected wardrobe mishaps can occur at any time. A small repair kit containing safety pins, sewing needles, thread, buttons, and stain remover wipes can be a lifesaver. this allows teachers to quickly address minor clothing issues without disrupting their day or feeling self-conscious. Compact kits that can easily fit in a desk drawer or bag are ideal.Key features of a great teacher's survival kit include:

*   Practicality and usefulness

## Core Benefits

A well-thought-out teacher survival kit offers a multitude of benefits that extend beyond mere convenience. It directly impacts a teacher's well-being, productivity, and overall effectiveness in the classroom.**Reduced Stress and Anxiety:** Having essential items readily available eliminates the stress of scrambling for necessities during the workday. Knowing that solutions for common problems are at hand provides a sense of control and reduces anxiety.For example, having pain relievers for unexpected headaches or a change of clothes for spills eliminates small moments of panic during a chaotic day.

**Improved Time Management:** A kit stocked with organizational tools and readily accessible supplies saves valuable time. Instead of searching for a pen, tape, or stapler, these items are readily available, allowing teachers to focus on more important tasks like lesson planning and student interaction. This efficiency contributes to a more streamlined and productive workday.

**Enhanced Self-Care:** Including items that promote relaxation and well-being encourages teachers to prioritize self-care, even during busy school days. Taking a few minutes for aromatherapy or stress relief exercises can considerably improve mood and reduce burnout.These small acts of self-care can have a profound impact on overall mental and physical health.

**Increased Preparedness:** A comprehensive survival kit ensures that teachers are prepared for a wide range of unforeseen circumstances, from minor emergencies to unexpected challenges. Having items like first-aid supplies, spare snacks, and dialog tools readily available can make a significant difference in handling unexpected situations with confidence and competence.

**Boosted Morale and Confidence:** Knowing that you are well-prepared and have the necessary tools to handle your day-to-day challenges boosts confidence and morale. Showing that you've taken the time to assemble a comprehensive kit sends a message that you're invested in your well-being and dedicated to your profession. This can make a significant difference in job satisfaction and overall sense of purpose.

1lchmcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1lchmcm/is_it_normal_to_be_unemployed_a_month_after/,Is it normal to be unemployed a month after graduation from college?,"Hey everyone,

I graduated a little over a month ago with a Bachelor's in Applied Arts and Sciences, with concentrations in Cybersecurity, Cybercrime, and General Business. Since then, I’ve been actively job hunting, mainly focusing on entry-level roles in cybersecurity.

So far, I’ve applied to 30+ jobs through platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, Zip Recuiter and Handshake. I put effort into every applicatio. My resume and cover letters are tailored, and after applying, I usually cold email recruiters. I try to highlight my accomplishments, connect with the company’s values, mention something unique about their cybersecurity work, and kindly ask if they’d be open to a virtual coffee chat.

Out of all of that, only one recruiter responded and actually took time to give me valuable feedback. Aside from that, I’ve gotten 11 rejection emails, 2 canceled roles, and a lot of applications just sitting in the void. I’ve started filtering job listings by the past 24 hours so I can apply early, but still no interviews yet.

I’m starting to feel a bit lost and discouraged. I’m doing everything I can think of, but I’m wondering is this just how it goes when you’re starting out, or is there something I should be doing differently?

Would really appreciate any advice, encouragement, or even just hearing from people in the same boat.

Thanks in advance.

My friend and her date met on a cafe and yes, my friend said it's the real Bucky Barnes. She said that it made him seem a little nervous from my friend knowing who he is. She asked what's the matter and he said that not a lot of people seems to notice him til that point so he isn't completely expecting it her to know him. They talked for a bit about random topics and friend didn't pass up the chance to ask about Captain America somewhere in all that talk. It's going okay until things started to escalate.

See, the inhuman power of my friend is mentally heightening the negative effect of certain words she says to someone as long as it means something to them. She can just say ""kill self"" to a bad person and when they think about it even a little bit, they would have the strong desire to do it despite not wanting to just for slightly thinking of it. Well, after my friend mentioned the word ""homecoming,"" Bucky got noticeably so mad and held his head in pain for some reasons. Friend asked what's the matter, but instead of giving a normal answer, he slammed the table, causing it to be split in half and both their coffee mugs to fall to the floor. He repeatedly apologised and ran out immediately.

We still don't know what's that about, but he didn't return to the cafe, so my friend left. They messaged each other and my friend asked what happened? He said that he just isn't feeling well and didn't come back because he just heard that Sam Wilson, or the Falcon, gave Captain America's shield to the government. He said he's not in the right headspace for more dates with my friend and they stopped contacting each.

1lchlhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lchlhk/hr_voice_in_the_woods/,[HR] Voice in the woods,"HR We live tucked deep in the Southern Appalachian mountains, in a holler no GPS will find and no outsider wants to stumble into after dark. The kind of place where the woods don’t end—they swallow. There’s a hush to the land out here. The kind of quiet that doesn’t feel empty, just watchful.

It was just past midnight when it happened. A Thursday, I think. The air was still, heavy with the scent of moss and pine, the kind of thick silence that settles over everything once the cicadas burn out. The kids were asleep. My wife had gone to bed an hour earlier, and I stayed behind in the kitchen, sipping bad coffee and scrolling through nothing.

Then I heard her call my name—sharp, afraid.

I moved fast. That’s not how she calls unless something’s wrong. I bolted down the hall toward our bedroom—only to find it empty. The covers pulled back, the lamp still on. My stomach dropped.

Out the window, I spotted her—sitting in our old Jeep, parked just beyond the porch light’s reach. The moon was bright enough to cast everything in silver, and I could see her clearly, wide-eyed, staring out across the yard toward the woods.

That’s when John ran.

He came tearing down the gravel drive barefoot, shirtless, wild-eyed. He didn’t even look at me. Just hit the treeline and vanished into the dark like something was chasing him, or like he was running straight into hell to avoid it.

Then I heard it.

“Hello?”

A child’s voice. Small. Lost. A little girl—no older than six. It floated out from the black edge of the woods, just beyond the first row of trees.

There was something about it—the way it held my name without saying it. The way it cracked just a little at the end, like she was trying not to cry.

I called back, “Hey! Who’s out there?”

The voice answered, same tone. Same softness.
“Hello?”

It wasn’t just an answer. It was an echo—but not mine. It didn’t sound like something trying to be a kid. It sounded like something pretending. And doing it too well.

My wife hadn’t moved. Still frozen in the car, but now she was staring at me. I saw it in her face—the shift. From fear to real fear. Whatever was in those woods, she felt it too.

I motioned her toward the house, and she moved fast. She left the car door open as she sprinted. The moment she passed me, I turned to follow.

That’s when it called again.

“Hello?”

Closer now. Same voice. Too close.

Every inch of my body tightened. My skin knew before my brain did: this wasn’t some lost child. This was a trap. Something trying to get close enough for something worse.

I broke into a sprint. Feet hitting the porch hard, the wood creaking under me. I slammed the front door shut and threw the deadbolt. My wife collapsed against the hallway wall, breathing fast. I didn’t ask questions—I didn’t need to.

We both knew.

Silence. Then—

Scratch.
Low. Deliberate. A slow drag of nails—not fingertips—across the wood just beneath the handle.

Then the voice again. Just on the other side.

“Hello?”

The scratching stopped.

No footsteps. No rustling. Just that brutal silence the mountains keep like a secret. You could’ve heard a mouse shift in the walls—or your own heartbeat cracking in your ears.

We stood still. My wife slid down the wall and curled her knees to her chest. I placed one hand on the doorframe like I was holding it closed with more than just the lock. Truth was, I didn’t trust the bolt. Not with that voice out there.

Out here in the deep woods, you learn to respect what doesn’t make sense.

I checked the time. 1:03 a.m. That meant we had hours before dawn. Hours of shadow. Of not knowing. Of that thing waiting out there. Or worse—circling.

“Should we call someone?” she whispered.

Call who? The county sheriff lives forty minutes away. Cell signal’s a rumor this deep in the holler. Even if we got a bar, what do I say?
“Something’s scratching my door and pretending to be a lost little girl”?

She knew the answer already. She didn’t ask again.

I walked to the back window and peered through the blinds. The treeline lay still. The moon lit up the yard like frost, but past the first dozen trees, it was all ink. That kind of dark where your eyes never adjust. Like the woods weren’t empty—just full of something that knew how to hold still.

And that voice…

It wasn’t gone. Not really. I could feel it, just past the light. Like someone watching you from a place they’ve already memorized.

That’s the thing about these mountains: they know how to listen. They soak up sound. They let your screams die in the hollows and come back to you as whispers. They don’t care if you’re scared.

I pulled the shotgun from above the fireplace. It was loaded. It wouldn’t help.

“Maybe it’s gone,” my wife said. But she didn’t believe it. Her voice was just one more thing to keep the quiet from swallowing us.

I don’t know what time I fell asleep, but I remember the last thing I heard before I did.

A soft tap. Not a knock. Just a test. Like a finger running along glass.

From the kitchen window this time.

Then—

“Hello?”
They say the mountains have rules.

Old ones. Not written down, not spoken often. Just known. If you grow up in these woods—or stay long enough—you learn to keep your porch light on, your curtains closed, and your door locked tight after sunset. You don’t whistle at night. You don’t call back when something calls your name. And above all, you don’t open the door.

We didn’t open the door.

But that thing didn’t leave.

The next few hours blurred into a long, breathless stretch of waiting. The tapping moved—sometimes on the front door, sometimes the windows. Sometimes it circled the house in long, dragging loops. I’d hear it at the kitchen glass…then five seconds later, at the back porch…then, nothing.

Then—

“Hello?”

My wife clutched my hand tight whenever it came close. She didn’t ask what it was. She knew. It wasn’t a child. It wasn’t lost. It was inviting itself in.

At 2:27 a.m., it found the kids’ window.

The first tap was light—like a moth against the glass. Then another. Then three in a row. Rhythmic.

My daughter’s voice floated down the hall. “Daddy?”

I was already moving.

I slipped into the room. She and her younger brother sat up in bed, their eyes wide but calm. They didn’t cry. Didn’t scream. Mountain kids. They’d been raised to respect the dark.

“There’s someone at the window,” she said. “She keeps saying hello.”

I looked. The curtains were drawn. But I felt it. Right there, on the other side.

I motioned them out of the room silently, guiding them to the couch in the living room where my wife had pulled blankets and cushions into a quiet nest.

We didn’t speak. Not because we were afraid to—but because it was listening.

For the next hour, it danced around the house. The voice would disappear, and in its place—silence so loud you could feel it vibrating inside your chest. The kind of quiet that doesn't bring peace. The kind that tells you something's thinking.

Then, around 4:00 a.m., it changed.

No more tapping.

No more “Hello?”

Just a thump. A weight. Something leaning against the front door.

Then—

“Joe.”

The voice didn’t belong to a child anymore.

It was John.

“Joe—man, it’s me. Please. I didn’t know where else to go.”
His voice cracked like a branch splitting under pressure. “Please open the door.”

My hands went numb.

He said my name again. And again. Always with the same rhythm. Same crack. Same tone.

“Please. Please open the door.”

I stared at the deadbolt.

My wife sat upright, her hand trembling now. She shook her head, just once. Hard.

“Joe—I think it broke my leg,” the voice said next. “I think it’s out there somewhere. Please.”

But he didn’t knock.

And he didn’t move.

And that’s how I knew.

Whatever was out there, whatever had chased John into those woods—it didn’t need to find him. It had learned him. Learned his panic, his words, his voice, his fear.

Now it was wearing him.

The kids stared at me, silent. Their faces pale in the candlelight. The tapping had stopped completely.

The voice spoke again.

“Joe?”

It said my name in the same tone the girl had used.

The exact same tone.
Around 4:45 a.m., the woods changed.

Not the way city folks mean when they talk about sunrise—no birdsong, no golden sky. In these mountains, dawn doesn’t arrive. It climbs. It crawls its way up the ridges and slips through the trees like a ghost. And until it crests the ridge behind our house, it’s still night.

The voice hadn’t spoken in half an hour.

That silence was the worst part.

We all sat in the living room, blankets wrapped tight, the kids drowsy but too afraid to sleep. My wife had one hand on my son’s shoulder, her eyes on the door. I hadn’t moved in twenty minutes. Didn’t breathe right. Couldn’t.

It was waiting.

That much I knew in my bones. Not gone. Not walking away. Just waiting for the right shape to wear. The right voice. The final thread.

Then came the whisper.

Not at the window. Not the door. It came from inside.

From the hallway.

Soft. Measured.

“…Daddy?”

My heart stopped.

It wasn’t my daughter.

It sounded like her. But she was asleep, her head in my wife’s lap. I looked down at her—heard the shallow, panicked breath of a child pretending not to be awake.

Another whisper. From deeper down the hall, just around the corner.
“Daddy… can you help me?”

I stood slowly. My wife shook her head again, her grip tightening on the kids.

“I’m stuck,” the voice said. Higher now. Fragile. “I can’t get out.”

I stepped toward the hall. My boots silent on the old pine floor.

“I’m scared.”

Three words. Just three. But they came too smooth. Too rehearsed. Like someone trying not to get the words wrong.

I crept down the hallway, hand tight on the shotgun. I passed the kids’ bedroom door. The sound came again.

“Daddy?”

From the basement door.

That door was always shut. Locked from the inside.

I stood there, breathing slow. My father’s words echoed from a time I hadn’t thought of in years.
""Don’t ever open a door just because something on the other side knows your name.""

I didn’t.

Instead, I dropped to my knees and pressed one ear to the wood.

It went quiet.

Then something scraped, slow and low, just beyond the frame.

Like fingernails on stone.

Then the voice spoke one more time.

“Help me daddy im stuck”
Pleading so close to my daughters voice. But not quite just enough off to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. 

I stood and backed away. Never turned my back on that door.

---

At 6:13 a.m., the first light broke the treetops.

The tapping never returned.

But the woods never went back to normal either.

We didn’t open the door.

But that thing didn’t leave.

The next few hours blurred into a long, breathless stretch of waiting. The tapping moved—sometimes on the front door, sometimes the windows. Sometimes it circled the house in long, dragging loops. I’d hear it at the kitchen glass…then five seconds later, at the back porch…then, nothing.

Then—

“Hello?”

My wife clutched my hand tight whenever it came close. She didn’t ask what it was. She knew. It wasn’t a child. It wasn’t lost. It was inviting itself in.

At 2:27 a.m., it found the kids’ window.

The first tap was light—like a moth against the glass. Then another. Then three in a row. Rhythmic.

My daughter’s voice floated down the hall. “Daddy?”

I was already moving.

I slipped into the room. She and her younger brother sat up in bed, their eyes wide but calm. They didn’t cry. Didn’t scream. Mountain kids. They’d been raised to respect the dark.

“There’s someone at the window,” she said. “She keeps saying hello.”

I looked. The curtains were drawn. But I felt it. Right there, on the other side.

I motioned them out of the room silently, guiding them to the couch in the living room where my wife had pulled blankets and cushions into a quiet nest.

We didn’t speak. Not because we were afraid to—but because it was listening.

For the next hour, it danced around the house. The voice would disappear, and in its place—silence so loud you could feel it vibrating inside your chest. The kind of quiet that doesn't bring peace. The kind that tells you something's thinking.

Then, around 4:00 a.m., it changed.

No more tapping.

No more “Hello?”

Just a thump. A weight. Something leaning against the front door.

Then—

“Joe.”

The voice didn’t belong to a child anymore.

It was John.

“Joe—man, it’s me. Please. I didn’t know where else to go.”
His voice cracked like a branch splitting under pressure. “Please open the door.”

My hands went numb.

He said my name again. And again. Always with the same rhythm. Same crack. Same tone.

“Please. Please open the door.”

I stared at the deadbolt.

My wife sat upright, her hand trembling now. She shook her head, just once. Hard.

“Joe—I think it broke my leg,” the voice said next. “I think it’s out there somewhere. Please.”

But he didn’t knock.

And he didn’t move.

And that’s how I knew.

Whatever was out there, whatever had chased John into those woods—it didn’t need to find him. It had learned him. Learned his panic, his words, his voice, his fear.

Now it was wearing him.

The kids stared at me, silent. Their faces pale in the candlelight. The tapping had stopped completely.

The voice spoke again.

“Joe?”

It said my name in the same tone the girl had used.

The exact same tone.
Around 4:45 a.m., the woods changed.

Not the way city folks mean when they talk about sunrise—no birdsong, no golden sky. In these mountains, dawn doesn’t arrive. It climbs. It crawls its way up the ridges and slips through the trees like a ghost. And until it crests the ridge behind our house, it’s still night.

The voice hadn’t spoken in half an hour.

That silence was the worst part.

We all sat in the living room, blankets wrapped tight, the kids drowsy but too afraid to sleep. My wife had one hand on my son’s shoulder, her eyes on the door. I hadn’t moved in twenty minutes. Didn’t breathe right. Couldn’t.

It was waiting.

That much I knew in my bones. Not gone. Not walking away. Just waiting for the right shape to wear. The right voice. The final thread.

Then came the whisper.

Not at the window. Not the door. It came from inside.

From the hallway.

Soft. Measured.

“…Daddy?”

My heart stopped.

It wasn’t my daughter.

It sounded like her. But she was asleep, her head in my wife’s lap. I looked down at her—heard the shallow, panicked breath of a child pretending not to be awake.

Another whisper. From deeper down the hall, just around the corner.
“Daddy… can you help me?”

I stood slowly. My wife shook her head again, her grip tightening on the kids.

“I’m stuck,” the voice said. Higher now. Fragile. “I can’t get out.”

I stepped toward the hall. My boots silent on the old pine floor.

“I’m scared.”

Three words. Just three. But they came too smooth. Too rehearsed. Like someone trying not to get the words wrong.

I crept down the hallway, hand tight on the shotgun. I passed the kids’ bedroom door. The sound came again.

“Daddy?”

From the basement door.

That door was always shut. Locked from the inside.

I stood there, breathing slow. My father’s words echoed from a time I hadn’t thought of in years.
""Don’t ever open a door just because something on the other side knows your name.""

I didn’t.

Instead, I dropped to my knees and pressed one ear to the wood.

It went quiet.

Then something scraped, slow and low, just beyond the frame.

Like fingernails on stone.

Then the voice spoke one more time.

“Help me daddy im stuck”
Pleading so close to my daughters voice. But not quite just enough off to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. 

I stood and backed away. Never turned my back on that door.

---

At 6:13 a.m., the first light broke the treetops.

The tapping never returned.

But the woods never went back to normal either.

My sister Lisa and I used to go out for meals together pretty regularly but lately shes been making comments about every single thing I order. It started small but now its getting really annoying and making me not want to eat with her anymore.

Last month we went to brunch and I ordered pancakes with bacon and Lisa immediately said thats a lot of calories for one meal. When I pointed out that its brunch and Im allowed to enjoy myself she said she was just looking out for my health because she cares about me.

Then when we went to dinner a few weeks later I got a burger and fries and Lisa made this face like I had ordered something disgusting. She kept talking about how she read an article about processed meat being bad for you and suggesting I should try the salmon instead.

The worst part is that Lisa acts like shes being helpful but it just makes me feel judged and self conscious about eating. Yesterday we went to get coffee and I ordered a latte with whipped cream. Lisa said I should get almond milk instead of regular milk and skip the whipped cream to cut down on sugar.

I told Lisa that her constant food commentary was bothering me and asked her to stop. She got defensive and said she only makes suggestions because she wants me to be healthy and happy. She also said that as my sister shes allowed to care about what I put in my body.

Lisa pointed out that I used to make similar comments about her eating habits when we were younger. But that was like 10 years ago when we were teenagers and I grew out of that behavior. I dont understand why she thinks its okay to police my food choices now that were both adults.

When I said I might start avoiding eating out with her Lisa accused me of being oversensitive. She said that people who love you should be able to give honest feedback and that Im taking her comments too personally.

My mom thinks Lisa means well and that I should just ignore her suggestions if I dont want to follow them. But its hard to enjoy a meal when someone is constantly critiquing your choices and making you feel guilty about everything you order.

My friend has been trying to kinda get us together for the better part of half a year now. I like her but don't message, text or anything else. We just hang out in mutual settings. However, I want to figure out how to ask her out for some coffee or anything, but I don't have the current ability to because we only hang out when my friend invites us all for drinks. Problem is i'm way to afraid of women (that was a joke, I'm just introverted)

I have two ideas of what I can do.

1. Beg my friend (who has been trying to get us together) to set up another drinking occasion or something.
2. Add her to my snapchat contact list. I feel like that would be an easy way to start casually ""messaging""

Basically, that's the gist. I'm open for advice and whatnot, but also curious if it's fine to ask someone out over Snapchat (I also have her number and Instagram but we haven't messaged once on either of those).

OH, quick side note is that we work in adjacent buildings, so I feel like I could just ask her out for lunch on a whim if we were snapping",1,1750040384.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1lchhny,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lchhny/sf_i_hate_coffee_and_gas_stations/,[SF] I HATE Coffee... and Gas Stations,"Have you ever been to a gas station in the American Midwest? Have you ever needed to use the bathroom at said gas station? Surely you’ve passed the couple smoking, and as you walk through the doors, you wonder if they might share some weed with you. 

You decide they probably wouldn’t. Mostly because they think you look like a pervert with both of your hands covering your crotch, but also because they didn’t seem like the sharing type. 

You make your way past aisle after aisle of the same potato chips, the cheap beer calls you by name. One of the workers gives you a dirty look because you have a giant \**freaking\** coffee stain on the crotch area of your pants, and for some reason you think covering it with your hands would make it look better.

But it’s okay. Yeah, it’s all going to be fine. Because that worker hates her job, her boyfriend, and her life. She’s miserable, and that brings you a strange sense of joy even as you know this woman thinks you’re a creep reeking of coffee. 

You walk past the coffee machine as you continue the search for the bathroom. Your sight blurs and the gas station starts to spin. You have to lean against a rack of candy to stop yourself from falling onto an old lady. Gathering your senses, you return to the search, taking a second to glare at the coffee pots. After all, they did start this whole thing. 

You’re lost. Lost in the gas station. Lost in this hell of concrete flooring and fluorescent lighting, I’m going to die here, surrounded by thousands of potato-chip bags. 

My forehead cracked the bathroom mirror. 

I’m losing it.

Huh, odly I thought that’d take longer. 

As I tried to wash the blood and the pieces of glass off, I heared people behind me. 

A man, forty-five, cleared his throat as a white-man signal to move out of the way, while his kid stared at me. The kid celebrated his twelfth birthday just yesterday. How exciting!

I stood between the sink and their dirty, disgusting hands. I didn’t need to see them. If I focused for just a minute, I could see. Like a bat or a beluga whale, I ecolocated the man and his child. The man wore the exhausted look of someone currently losing a custody battle. Maybe this trip to Six Flags would give him an edge over Cheryl in the upcoming hearing.

My body’s shaking. My world spun faster the more I looked at this sad man and the child he was losing. 

The kid, bless his heart, didn’t understand all the yelling at home, but he was excited to ride *American Thunder.* 

My jaw clenched so hard I think I fractured a tooth. My world was spiraling like I had been pushed down three flights of stairs–I could focus for only a second. Only see bits and pieces.  

Like the water he needed to clean his vile hands with, fear washed over the kid; he thinks I’m on drugs. *I’m not.* The old man assessed the situation. Thinking I was on drugs, I’m not. He was torn between asking if I was okay and running away to the safety of the parking lot. He tried to piece together who I was, only coming up with two possibilities: I either escaped an asylum of some kind, or I was on more drugs than he could count. Both were close guesses. 

Both father and son decided that I was insane. The old man thought that, homeless or not, he was going to call the police on my ass. 

My left eye was the only thing that would listen to what I was saying; it opened, and blood dripped past my vision like rain. From the mirror, I stared into the man’s eyes as I willed my right eye to open– the twelve-year-old screamed when he saw my eyes, maybe it was because I lost my prosthetic one a few days ago, maybe it was the blood pouring down my face. Personally? I think it was the glass lodged in my forehead. 

They fled. 

The man pulled his phone out. The police would be here in ten minutes.

My head spun. I gotta get this power under control, and never drink coffee again. 

Between the cruel joke that was my depth perception and the overwhelming vertigo, courtesy of my powers, I could only make it a few steps away from the sinks before falling to my knees. 

An acidic smell filled the bathroom as I expelled the contents of my lunch. It joined the coffee and the blood on my pants. 

If my pants ever read this. . . I’m so, so sorry. 

There I was, on my hands and knees in a puddle of puke, in a shitty gas station bathroom, located next to the middle of nowhere. 

My body was telling me that I earned a break after all this hard work. So I rolled onto my back, inches away from lying in the urinal.

So, I (22f) have a friend, Ashley (22f). We have known each other since second grade (8y old) but we only became friends in highschool (9^(th) grade, 15y). Our friendship was rocky sometimes but we always cared about each other very much and we still love each other to this day. This happened in our first year of collage (19 and 20y old). We hit a rough patch in our friendship because she decided to move away from her dad (who lives really close to my home) and move in with her sister (who lives really far away, but still in the same city). We didn’t really know how to navigate the new things in front of us: college, me working, being far away from each other, family problems on her side, some shitty things I did (not to her or people close to her, my own personal bullshit), stress etc. It was frankly a shitty period for us individually and together.

In this period of time she started dating-ish this guy, Ted (22 at that time, 24 present time). They met each other because they were neighbors and hit it off because they both like photography. They decided at some point to go out in a park after talking for a little bit, and he made her wait for an hour and a half because he fell asleep. I need to mention that it was autumn at the time and it was chilly af outside. I asked why tf did she wait for more than, like, half an hour at best, in case something happened, like and accident or something, and she said that she didn’t mind that much because she just watched a show on her phone.

I hoped in that moment that she would not go out with him anymore. I even told her that at that time. But she started a friends with benefits thing with him. I told her that it was not really a good idea because I knew she would fall for him (spoiler she did), and he’s not really a great guy and she shouldn’t settle just because she’s not really over THE LOVE OF HER LIFE EX (another bitch ass man). She didn’t listen ofc and after like 3 months of being fwb they made the relationship official, and then it came the time for me to meet him. And ofc I didn’t like him one bit but that’s not really important. What is important is the fact that after he left, she came to me and asked me what I thought of him. I asked her if she really wanted me to be honest and she said yes (she didn’t really) and I told her that when friends present their partner, the thing that I look at is how that person looks at my friend. So I told her that he doesn’t look at u like he likes u, he doesn’t look at u like he’s falling for u, he doesn’t look like he has a massive crush on u or like he’s enamored with u, he looks at u like you’re just any other person in the room. She of course got defensive and said that I don’t know how he is when they are alone.

A month passes since they became official and all that time she kept complaining about him, such as him looking at other girls’ butts on the street when they are walking hand in hand. When she said that that’s not ok, he was all like “what’s beautiful even god admires”. He still had tinder on his phone because “he wanted to see which girls gave him likes, but he didn’t talk to anyone” but then he uninstalled it and suddenly she was all like “aight he uninstalled it”, even though that explanation was not ok. Bro u have a gf, why do u give a fuck which other girls give u a like on fucking tinder.

But the worst thing he did in that month was when they were supposed to go for a few days on a mountain trip with his friends. He didn’t fucking wake up (bro has a pattern). She went over to his place and tried to wake him up, AND HE FINALLY DID. She asked him to hurry and asked him if he needed help with anything to speed things up because they were already late for their train. He said no and started packing (he didn’t pack the night before) and started WASHING HIS CARPET (I cant make this shit up). She was fuming of course because they were already late because of him and he started doing dumb shit instead of hurrying tf up. And she told him that, and his reaction was: “well u could have helped”. SHE OFFERED HIM HELP AND HE SAID NO, and then acted like it was her fucking fault. And then they lost the train, got another and had to wait at the station for like an hour for it. And that also made his friends wait for him and also miss the train, AND THEN HE GAVE HER THE COLD SHOULDER FOR MOST OF THE TRIP, WITH HIS FRIENDS THAT SHE MET FOR THE FIRST TIME.

I was floored when she told me all that afterwards, and I told her straight up to break tf up with him. A person who doesn’t respect people’s time is a person who doesn’t respect them. And on top of that there was also all the shit that he had already done.

Oh, also, in regards the thing with him not waking up: it’s not because he is tired from working or things like that, because that would be somewhat understandable. But no, my guy just doesn’t fucking wake up for things. Ofc tho she doesn’t break up with him, because why have some self-respect?

After 4 months of being official she said to me that she sleeps at his place every day. Now, here is where “I lost my shit” because she had been really upset with me in the past when I did that with my last relationship, since it wasn’t ok doing so that soon (which she was right about). BUT then she goes and does the same exact thing, her reasoning being that during the day she goes home or does her thing, goes to collage etc. And in the evening she sleeps at his place.

Now, I knew she did that as an escapism from home because at her sister’s place everything was shit, and she went to sleep at his place because it was more peaceful. I told her that it was too soon and she shouldn’t be acting like a married couple, in the day at work and in the evenings at home, that she should and could sleep at home 2-3 nights per week, and that this way she wouldn’t form a codependent relationship with him, and that it was gonna be hard to get out of it if it became a necessity.

Also, I reiterated all the reasons that she should break up with him again and told her to not argue with me because I’m not gonna change any of my views about him or this relationship and just to read the paragraph with an open mind (I forgot to mention, the conversation happened over text). She read and didn’t argue with me but ofc she didn’t wanna understand anything I had said, even though I said that my concerns came from a place of love and it pained me to see her settle for someone who doesn’t treat her right, when I know that she deserves better than everything I have stated so far. And then to be codependent with a guy like that could only turn out badly for her (and oh it sure did).

After that we became cold with each other, because of the relationship (I frankly lost my respect for her for staying with him) and for other reasons from both parties (frankly we didn’t like each other anymore) and decided to part ways while we still loved each other because at that time we weren’t able to resolve our conflicts, and if we continued being friends we would keep bickering and maybe end up hating each other or not liking each other at all anymore, and we didn’t want that to happen. So we parted ways in amicable terms, with a lot of crying, and without talking through our issues. We just decided for a break, so that we could grow up a little in our separate ways, and then come back when the time was right.

The time came after a year (the start of 3^(rd) year of college, 21y old both). She got in touch with me and we decided to go out for coffee. We talked about everything for about 6 hours, she apologized for her wrongdoings, I apologized for mine, boundaries and insecurities discussed, how we wanted our friendship to be like moving forward etc. Everything was good until I asked her about Ted, the only “issue” that had not yet been addressed.

I asked first how it was going between them (we still had each other on socials of course, so I knew they were still together). And she told me a lot of stuff that was not good. She moved in with him because her sister moved out to the countryside and Ashley didn’t want to move back with her dad. And so she moved in with Ted, while being unemployed, and living in his house and on his money. And ofc things were fucking shit (and I won’t get into details about some because they are too personal). But things were also bad in regards to the house dynamic, and also emotionally, sexually. Basically, in her words nothing was working out between them (they had like 1 year and a half here of being in a relationship).

 I asked why she didn’t break up with him and move back in with her dad, and she told the reasons (again too personal to mention), and explained to me that she was basically stuck with him until the end collage this year, and then she would get a job and move out. I told her to get a part time job to save up money so she would have some months of rent already paid up when she moves out. She said that that was her plan.

Then she hit me with the following info: this guy violently shoved her 2 separate times. One time he told her to close the window because he was going to sleep. They were in bed, and she said “2 seconds” because she was playing on her phone at the moment. He got upset and got up and closed it himself. When he got back in bed HE PUSHED HER OUT, LIKE FULL ON SHOVED HER FORCEFULLY OUT OF THE BED AND SHE FELL ON THE GROUND.

The second time they were arguing in the kitchen in the morning and she raised her voice at him and they were both standing and he pushed her again, like full on he was so angry he pushed her with his hands. She tried to explain to him it was not ok both times and he doesn’t understand to this day that he scared her and why it’s not ok to get physical with your gf even if u don’t end up slapping or punching her (though she did get hurt a little when she fell out of bed).

When she told me this I cried. I was and still am heartbroken over this. I couldn’t imagine any of my friends going through a situation like this, having a man be aggressive towards them. I knew he was shitty, but I never expected this. I bawled my eyes out because I hated the fact that this happened to her, I hated the fact that my words came true, I hated that I was right that he was shit, I hated that she was stuck with him and actually formed that codependent relationship, as I warned it would happen, I hated everything in that moment and I hated her because she didn’t listen to me because I would have saved her a lot of heartbreak and a shitty situation that she couldn’t get out from at that moment.

I think I still resent her a little to this day because she was too stubborn and didn’t listen to fucking anyone (not just me) about him. One condition to us being friends again after she told me this (and maybe I was shitty with this) was that she leaves him. I told her: if u won’t get out while u can once we finish college and get a job, I will cut u out because I can’t watch u do this to yourself, I love u too much, I’m the type to be involved in my friends lives, and I can’t be a bridesmaid at your wedding with this man because I want him gone from the face of the earth. I don’t want to ever see him in front of me ever again. I can’t be friends with u if I can’t support your relationship and if I can’t fucking stand him breathing the same air as me and you. If by the end of college u don’t get a job and leave him I will cut u out because I can’t be worried about u getting beaten up or something worse. I told her that if she decides to stay we won’t speak anymore or see each other, but she would always be able to call me if something happens and she needs help, and she would forever have a safety net with me, but I will not be there, just in case of emergency (regarding him or other matters).

So now present day she stays with him because she needs to. Things are also still not working in the relationship. She got a part-time, well-paid job. But she didn’t save up because she of course had to pitch in for bills and food now that she got an income. And also I don’t see her determined to leave whenever I ask her about it. She seems still on the fence even though she comes to me and tells me that mostly things are not working (also he hadn’t been aggressive with her since).

 But things are still bad. They are more apartment colleagues than a couple, and he’s still a piece of shit with her (one instance was when she was grieving the death of a relative and he asked for a blowjob, and this being only one shitty thing that he did).

So, would I be the ahole if I wait for her to get a full time job, wait a few months (like, maybe 6 or so) after she gets the job, so she has time to save money, and if she doesn’t leave him after all that, to cut her off (with the mention that she can always come to me for help)?",1,1750040319.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

It's a colorful, cartoony hidden object books, except the objects are various people and characters in extremely crowded scenarios. Where's Waldo is easily the closest comparison, with an extremely similar art style and type of challenge, except that I am confident Waldo never made an appearance.

There are two major notable properties that seperate this book in my mind. The first is that it was huge. And I don’t mean it was thick like a phone book, I mean physically it was ginormous. Practically novelty-sized. It flipped up and down rather than side to side, and I would estimate its opened length to be about the same as a small coffee table.

The second was the scenarios. None were necessarily inappropiate, but I distinctly remember them being unusual. Hidden among the swaths of beachgoers you could find a hovel of sunburnt vampires. In the middle of the mall, a man is being haunted by a ghost and terrified. Weird things like that, and often they were not among the listed ""To Find"" objectives or characters. One of the setpieces is a military training obstacle course that progresses vertically, with more and more people dropping out as the path continues. One of the obstacles is a tunnel with monster eyes that’s labelled something like ""too horrible to show.""

Unfortunately, Googling this gets me nowhere. Every giant or large or enormous or whatever hidden object book that turns up is just really thick, not a novelty-sized flipbook. The cartoonish style is everywhere, but I've yet to recognize a single image. And to top it all off,  I am 95% sure the book was titled something quite generic.

If I saw a picture, I would recognize the book in a second. I just need some help tracking it down.",1,1750040185.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False

Even better, it transforms Asian models into Western-style looks, perfectly matching different markets! I found its images incredibly natural, with constantly updated poses and model bases—opening up so many creative options for my product visuals.

Looking back, That virtual try-on feature? Mind-blowing! It saved me a fortune on Western model shoots, sample shipping, and endless back-and-forth. Best part? I could pour all that saved energy into refining my products and nailing my marketing!

My Big Win: Pro Model Shots on a Budget
Now I create high-quality product images myself, and my store pages look sleek, professional, and totally on-brand. Every time I finish a set, I upload it and browse my store like a real customer—just to admire the view.
That feeling when you see the store you built—page by page—showcased to shoppers worldwide... and they actually hit 'buy'? Words can’t describe it!
Virtual Try-On is an efficiency beast. It whips up multi-angle model shots in seconds, making product pages pop while slashing editing time. I’m also blown away by how it handles details—folds and lines flow naturally, making my garments look authentic and premium.
Three months ago, I couldn’t even ace a white-background shot. Today? I run my own cross-border brand with confidence. Finding smart tools and staying hungry for innovation—that’s been my rocket fuel.

My friend has been trying to kinda get us together for the better part of half a year now. I like her but don't message, text or anything else. We just hang out in mutual settings. However, I want to figure out how to ask her out for some coffee or anything, but I don't have the current ability to because we only hang out when my friend invites us all for drinks. Problem is i'm way to afraid of women (that was a joke, I'm just introverted)

I have two ideas of what I can do. 

1. Beg my friend (who has been trying to get us together) to set up another drinking occasion or something.

2. Add her to my snapchat contact list. I feel like that would be an easy way to start casually ""messaging"" 

  
Basically, that's the gist. I'm open for advice and whatnot, but also curious if it's fine to ask someone out over Snapchat (I also have her number and Instagram but we haven't messaged once on either of those).

  
OH, quick side note is that we work in adjacent buildings, so I feel like I could just ask her out for lunch on a whim if we were snapping",1,1750040180.0,Crushes,2,1.0,False

It’s been hard learning to live without them again. Quiet, heavy, and kind of hollow. But today felt different.

I had a nice cup of coffee, read a few short stories, took myself out for a walk in the afternoon, and found some fig jam at the farmer’s market — just like the kind my grandma used to make when I was little. Now I'm having tea and toast with the jam, and I almost feel like my younger, lighter self again — back at my grandma’s cottage during summer holidays, no obligations, just love all around and endless time to enjoy the sunshine.

I hope this feeling lasts. I hope the little joys are starting to return, slowly but surely.

I drink water. I sleep regularly. My blood levels are all in normal range. No vitamin deficiencies, iron is fine. 

So I stopped having coffee 7 months ago. Had the worst withdrawals, like every other time I tried to quit. Two weeks of deep depression, physical pain, feeling like I had the flu, rage at the world. That has happened every time I quit coffee. This time I got through it. 

But I never “felt better” like everyone said. A month? No. Two months? No. Four? Five? No! 

Still tired, still foggy headed, still had the same anxiety levels. I had a stint of a mental health episode at the beginning of the year, but that calmed down and I didn’t need to change my medication. This feeling wasn’t depression, either. It was like my brain didn’t have enough battery to work right. My thoughts were slow, I was sluggish, it sucked. And it never got better. I never started feeling more “alert” naturally. My sleep didn’t change. Nothing changed except I couldn’t think.

Then I had coffee again, and everything was fine. No jitters, no sleep issues, no anxiety, no racing thoughts. Just able to think. Like I finally plugged into the right power source and my brain could charge properly. 

At this point I’m like, why even bother quitting when after OVER HALF A YEAR the only change was 2 weeks of being sick, then being basically the same as always but unable to function right? 

I kept reading that people went through this period and then started feeling more naturally clear headed and alert. Well after 7 months I didn’t have any improvement, and so I’m just saying “screw it” and sticking with coffee. 

I don’t get it. Am I supposed to be brain dead for a year? Two years? I saw posts of people feeling better after just a month or two. Is my brain just not wired to work without caffeine? Ugh. ",1,1750040163.0,CaffeineFreeLife,0,1.0,False

So, I (22f) have a friend, Ashley (22f). We have known each other since second grade (8y old) but we only became friends in highschool (9^(th) grade, 15y). Our friendship was rocky sometimes but we always cared about each other very much and we still love each other to this day. This happened in our first year of collage (19 and 20y old). We hit a rough patch in our friendship because she decided to move away from her dad (who lives really close to my home) and move in with her sister (who lives really far away, but still in the same city). We didn’t really know how to navigate the new things in front of us: college, me working, being far away from each other, family problems on her side, some shitty things I did (not to her or people close to her, my own personal bullshit), stress etc. It was frankly a shitty period for us individually and together.

In this period of time she started dating-ish this guy, Ted (22 at that time, 24 present time). They met each other because they were neighbors and hit it off because they both like photography. They decided at some point to go out in a park after talking for a little bit, and he made her wait for an hour and a half because he fell asleep. I need to mention that it was autumn at the time and it was chilly af outside. I asked why tf did she wait for more than, like, half an hour at best, in case something happened, like and accident or something, and she said that she didn’t mind that much because she just watched a show on her phone.

I hoped in that moment that she would not go out with him anymore. I even told her that at that time. But she started a friends with benefits thing with him. I told her that it was not really a good idea because I knew she would fall for him (spoiler she did), and he’s not really a great guy and she shouldn’t settle just because she’s not really over THE LOVE OF HER LIFE EX (another bitch ass man). She didn’t listen ofc and after like 3 months of being fwb they made the relationship official, and then it came the time for me to meet him. And ofc I didn’t like him one bit but that’s not really important. What is important is the fact that after he left, she came to me and asked me what I thought of him. I asked her if she really wanted me to be honest and she said yes (she didn’t really) and I told her that when friends present their partner, the thing that I look at is how that person looks at my friend. So I told her that he doesn’t look at u like he likes u, he doesn’t look at u like he’s falling for u, he doesn’t look like he has a massive crush on u or like he’s enamored with u, he looks at u like you’re just any other person in the room. She of course got defensive and said that I don’t know how he is when they are alone.

A month passes since they became official and all that time she kept complaining about him, such as him looking at other girls’ butts on the street when they are walking hand in hand. When she said that that’s not ok, he was all like “what’s beautiful even god admires”. He still had tinder on his phone because “he wanted to see which girls gave him likes, but he didn’t talk to anyone” but then he uninstalled it and suddenly she was all like “aight he uninstalled it”, even though that explanation was not ok. Bro u have a gf, why do u give a fuck which other girls give u a like on fucking tinder.

But the worst thing he did in that month was when they were supposed to go for a few days on a mountain trip with his friends. He didn’t fucking wake up (bro has a pattern). She went over to his place and tried to wake him up, AND HE FINALLY DID. She asked him to hurry and asked him if he needed help with anything to speed things up because they were already late for their train. He said no and started packing (he didn’t pack the night before) and started WASHING HIS CARPET (I cant make this shit up). She was fuming of course because they were already late because of him and he started doing dumb shit instead of hurrying tf up. And she told him that, and his reaction was: “well u could have helped”. SHE OFFERED HIM HELP AND HE SAID NO, and then acted like it was her fucking fault. And then they lost the train, got another and had to wait at the station for like an hour for it. And that also made his friends wait for him and also miss the train, AND THEN HE GAVE HER THE COLD SHOULDER FOR MOST OF THE TRIP, WITH HIS FRIENDS THAT SHE MET FOR THE FIRST TIME.

I was floored when she told me all that afterwards, and I told her straight up to break tf up with him. A person who doesn’t respect people’s time is a person who doesn’t respect them. And on top of that there was also all the shit that he had already done.

Oh, also, in regards the thing with him not waking up: it’s not because he is tired from working or things like that, because that would be somewhat understandable. But no, my guy just doesn’t fucking wake up for things. Ofc tho she doesn’t break up with him, because why have some self-respect?

After 4 months of being official she said to me that she sleeps at his place every day. Now, here is where “I lost my shit” because she had been really upset with me in the past when I did that with my last relationship, since it wasn’t ok doing so that soon (which she was right about). BUT then she goes and does the same exact thing, her reasoning being that during the day she goes home or does her thing, goes to collage etc. And in the evening she sleeps at his place.

Now, I knew she did that as an escapism from home because at her sister’s place everything was shit, and she went to sleep at his place because it was more peaceful. I told her that it was too soon and she shouldn’t be acting like a married couple, in the day at work and in the evenings at home, that she should and could sleep at home 2-3 nights per week, and that this way she wouldn’t form a codependent relationship with him, and that it was gonna be hard to get out of it if it became a necessity.

Also, I reiterated all the reasons that she should break up with him again and told her to not argue with me because I’m not gonna change any of my views about him or this relationship and just to read the paragraph with an open mind (I forgot to mention, the conversation happened over text). She read and didn’t argue with me but ofc she didn’t wanna understand anything I had said, even though I said that my concerns came from a place of love and it pained me to see her settle for someone who doesn’t treat her right, when I know that she deserves better than everything I have stated so far. And then to be codependent with a guy like that could only turn out badly for her (and oh it sure did).

After that we became cold with each other, because of the relationship (I frankly lost my respect for her for staying with him) and for other reasons from both parties (frankly we didn’t like each other anymore) and decided to part ways while we still loved each other because at that time we weren’t able to resolve our conflicts, and if we continued being friends we would keep bickering and maybe end up hating each other or not liking each other at all anymore, and we didn’t want that to happen. So we parted ways in amicable terms, with a lot of crying, and without talking through our issues. We just decided for a break, so that we could grow up a little in our separate ways, and then come back when the time was right.

The time came after a year (the start of 3^(rd) year of college, 21y old both). She got in touch with me and we decided to go out for coffee. We talked about everything for about 6 hours, she apologized for her wrongdoings, I apologized for mine, boundaries and insecurities discussed, how we wanted our friendship to be like moving forward etc. Everything was good until I asked her about Ted, the only “issue” that had not yet been addressed.

I asked first how it was going between them (we still had each other on socials of course, so I knew they were still together). And she told me a lot of stuff that was not good. She moved in with him because her sister moved out to the countryside and Ashley didn’t want to move back with her dad. And so she moved in with Ted, while being unemployed, and living in his house and on his money. And ofc things were fucking shit (and I won’t get into details about some because they are too personal). But things were also bad in regards to the house dynamic, and also emotionally, sexually. Basically, in her words nothing was working out between them (they had like 1 year and a half here of being in a relationship).

 I asked why she didn’t break up with him and move back in with her dad, and she told the reasons (again too personal to mention), and explained to me that she was basically stuck with him until the end collage this year, and then she would get a job and move out. I told her to get a part time job to save up money so she would have some months of rent already paid up when she moves out. She said that that was her plan.

Then she hit me with the following info: this guy violently shoved her 2 separate times. One time he told her to close the window because he was going to sleep. They were in bed, and she said “2 seconds” because she was playing on her phone at the moment. He got upset and got up and closed it himself. When he got back in bed HE PUSHED HER OUT, LIKE FULL ON SHOVED HER FORCEFULLY OUT OF THE BED AND SHE FELL ON THE GROUND.

The second time they were arguing in the kitchen in the morning and she raised her voice at him and they were both standing and he pushed her again, like full on he was so angry he pushed her with his hands. She tried to explain to him it was not ok both times and he doesn’t understand to this day that he scared her and why it’s not ok to get physical with your gf even if u don’t end up slapping or punching her (though she did get hurt a little when she fell out of bed).

When she told me this I cried. I was and still am heartbroken over this. I couldn’t imagine any of my friends going through a situation like this, having a man be aggressive towards them. I knew he was shitty, but I never expected this. I bawled my eyes out because I hated the fact that this happened to her, I hated the fact that my words came true, I hated that I was right that he was shit, I hated that she was stuck with him and actually formed that codependent relationship, as I warned it would happen, I hated everything in that moment and I hated her because she didn’t listen to me because I would have saved her a lot of heartbreak and a shitty situation that she couldn’t get out from at that moment.

I think I still resent her a little to this day because she was too stubborn and didn’t listen to fucking anyone (not just me) about him. One condition to us being friends again after she told me this (and maybe I was shitty with this) was that she leaves him. I told her: if u won’t get out while u can once we finish college and get a job, I will cut u out because I can’t watch u do this to yourself, I love u too much, I’m the type to be involved in my friends lives, and I can’t be a bridesmaid at your wedding with this man because I want him gone from the face of the earth. I don’t want to ever see him in front of me ever again. I can’t be friends with u if I can’t support your relationship and if I can’t fucking stand him breathing the same air as me and you. If by the end of college u don’t get a job and leave him I will cut u out because I can’t be worried about u getting beaten up or something worse. I told her that if she decides to stay we won’t speak anymore or see each other, but she would always be able to call me if something happens and she needs help, and she would forever have a safety net with me, but I will not be there, just in case of emergency (regarding him or other matters).

So now present day she stays with him because she needs to. Things are also still not working in the relationship. She got a part-time, well-paid job. But she didn’t save up because she of course had to pitch in for bills and food now that she got an income. And also I don’t see her determined to leave whenever I ask her about it. She seems still on the fence even though she comes to me and tells me that mostly things are not working (also he hadn’t been aggressive with her since).

 But things are still bad. They are more apartment colleagues than a couple, and he’s still a piece of shit with her (one instance was when she was grieving the death of a relative and he asked for a blowjob, and this being only one shitty thing that he did).

So, would I be the asshole if I wait for her to get a full time job, wait a few months (like, maybe 6 or so) after she gets the job, so she has time to save money, and if she doesn’t leave him after all that, to cut her off (with the mention that she can always come to me for help)?",2,1750040150.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,0,1.0,False

Thanks for pointing out the typo everyone). I grew up in the 80s listening to post-punk, New Wave, Goth, New Romantics . . . all the alternative bands from the UK, US, Canada. A lot of it is in minor key, heavy on the bass and drums, wailing synths, crusty, distorted guitars. You get the picture.

Today, Sunday, at around 10am I went out to the backyard with my bluetooth speaker, a book and a coffee to enjoy a beautiful spring morning. I placed my speaker on the table next to me, cued up my favourite playlist, settled in, and started to read. 

My next door neighbours, with whom I have a very friendly and positive relationship, hired a contractor to replace their gutters. This contractor is, apparently, a family friend as he arrived on Friday and stayed for the weekend. They had a couple of nice evenings in the backyard, grilling up steaks and ribs, having drinks, and swimming. I should also mention that they are Evangelical Christians only because it is relevant to what happened next. I have nothing against them. I myself am Catholic and fully respect others' religious beliefs.

My neighbours left early to attend their regular Sunday church service leaving the contractor, his wife/assistant and teenaged daughter to finish the work on the gutters. As it happened, they were working just over the fence from me, maybe 10 meters away. My speaker, not particularly loud as it was right next to my head, began playing a song by The Cure (The Walk (IYKYK)). Unexpectedly, I heard a voice.

""Excuse me.""

I looked over at the fence to see a man's looking at me.

""Hey how are you,"" I said. ""Great job on the eavestroughs (the Canadian word for gutter).""

""Yeah thanks,"" he said. ""Listen, can you turn that music off?""

""I - what? I didn't think it was very loud, sorry,"" I said, taken aback.

""No it's the music -- we don't appreciate that godless music. It's all about death and violence,"" he said.

I was speechless. I gawped at him for another moment. The song was still playing, heading into the final chords. 

""Look, I'm not trying to be a jerk. That music doesn't go with my Christian beliefs and I don't want to hear it or my daughter listening to it,"" he said. Neither his wife nor daughter were nearby.

""Well, sorry, but I'm in my yard listening to my music. There's no rule against that unless it's after 11pm,"" I said. ""I'm sorry you don't like it but that's not my problem.""

""Life During Wartime"" started playing, as poppy and danceable a tune as ever came out of the 80s.

""It's Sunday and like I said it is seriously against my Christian beliefs to listen to that music,"" he said. 

""Well, again, I'm sorry you don't like it but it's my business what I do in my yard,"" I said. ""If you don't like it put in earplugs or something.""

""You're not being very Christian,"" he snapped. ""I shouldn't have to listen to it, especially on a Sunday."" Then he quoted something from the Bible about the wicked and God making them cry and gnash their teeth.

I looked at him for a long moment then shook my head.

""Whatever happened to 'Honour the sabbath and keep it holy'?"" I said. ""Shouldn't you not be working today?""

Looking for a semi-automatic machine. Ideally it grinds the beans and tamps them (or assists with the tamping) so I don’t have to deal with the mess of external grinder/tamper.

The r/superautomatic people sent me over here because I want a Portafilter.

This is for my mom’s house so has to be incredibly user friendly and especially easy to clean. I don’t necessarily want a superautomatic because of the cleaning of internal parts.

Usually we’re drinking americanos (so need a hot water dispenser) but occasionally do lattes or ice lattes. I think cold brew capabilities would be a plus but not necessarily required.

Want to be able to bust out lots of coffees in a row for when entertaining guests.

I have an Breville oracle touch that’s a few years old that I love. I’m looking for similar features/ease of use but not as high of a price point.

Located in the US and Budget is around $1200  (looking at the delonghi specialista maestro or the Breville barista touch impressa) but I could be flexible on this and wanted to ask you guys in case there might be some great machines that I have overlooked.

I want great coffee but don’t necessarily want to do the whole rigamarole of weighing beans/grinding/tamping outside of the machine and the mess that goes along with that",0,1750039403.0,espresso,6,0.25,False

I went to a pride event the other night and I ended up going home with a girl. she’s hot and sweet and we had a great time. she offered for me to stay the night but i headed home a little after 3am.

In hindsight I obviously should’ve checked in about what we were both looking for BEFORE going home with her, and will do that in any future scenarios, but tbh this was my first time hooking up with a complete stranger. 

we’ve texted a couple times since then, not a lot, rn she’s texting me about what kind of coffee she likes. it doesn’t exactly feel flirty, it’s basic getting to know you stuff and that could be 100% non-romantic but it’s hard to tell over text. (also my ex was so forward and confident that I’m not used to anything else lol). I’m sorta taking my time replying and deliberately not flirting in my responses, I really don’t want to lead her on but i am also not going to be a jerk and ghost her. I think she’s really cute and fun and probably an awesome person, and I’d be happy to be friends or friendly with her, but I know I can’t date right now… if that’s even what she wants, which I don’t know !!

so how do i bring this up? It feels weird to suddenly make the conversation serious, but I don’t want to waste her time! and i don’t want to make her feel bad but idk how to word it in a way that wouldn’t sound shitty",1,1750039305.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

After church, my girlfriend took us, and her girls to a local park for a picnic lunch. The kids played, and another dad came over to tell us how wonderful our kids are. She gave me some incredibly thoughtful gifts, and her kids did too. They said they thought of me as their dad, and were glad to have me in their lives.     

Then we all hiked to a waterfall, and got pictures together as a family. There was laughter, and exploring, and fun. There were also wet shoes and socks. We climbed down an escarpment, found some cool snakes, and petted lots of other people's dogs.     

Then we headed to my brother's house for a picnic. The kids played with their cousins, throwing Frisbees, playing corn hole, and badminton, while the adults enjoyed some beverages. Dinner was a cookout put on by my mom, and while we ate we played trivia.

1lch1d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1lch1d0/where_have_all_the_cute_girls_gone_abq/,Where have all the cute girls gone? (ABQ),"I’m a 21-year-old (male) college student in Albuquerque for a month for work (gov/mil stuff, nothing crazy). The only people in the city that I know are my colleagues, who I've had some nice hikes with, but I'd like to meet and hang out with someone my age, so I tried all the recommended things: dinner and live music in Old Town Plaza, summer music festival in Baloon Fiesta Park then hit some of the bars downtown that night, Salsa dance class, minor league baseball game, and shopping/reading in Nob Hill shops. 

Had fun and it's a cool way to see the city, but all the girls I talked to were either much older than I am (fun conservations, but not into that romantically) or just not very attractive (city tends on the heavy side). 

I get that most of the local college students went home for the summer, but I feel like there's gotta be something else going on, and you guys have a much better pulse on the cultural environment than I do - is there somewhere all the cute girls are hiding or something they're all doing that I just don't know about??

Other things I'll try (cause they're still fun anyway) are joining a climbing gym, going to movies (love a good local cinema), and just spending time reading at cute places like parks and coffee shops. Gyms are places where I've had lots of success in the past, but I workout at the on-base one so that probably won't be the case here. I I know my best odds are probably to try all the bars each weekend , but
1. I don’t drink or smoke or anything - that’s not a problem, I still like the dancing and talking but I wouldn’t do it for myself and 
2.  Based on what I saw last night there’s nothing there
 
I refuse to use a dating app out of principal, and think asking the city subreddit would be worse than picking a random point on the map and going there. 

In high school and college classes/clubs/sports it was always so easy because you’re thrust into situations with tons of girls your age, but it’s like they’ve all gone to hide away or something. I'm not asking for dating advice (though that's welcome if you'd like), just confused on how I can be in the prime of my life in a new city and somehow not even see a chick that it'd be fun to flirt and hang out with - not even anything serious, just a classic summer fling. 

Would love relevant takes for Albuquerque specifically, but I assume this is a widespread phenomenon, so tell me about your town too. Give me some hope.

To answer your preliminary questions:
No I’m not gay.
No I’m not fat.
No I’m not ugly.
No I’m not socially awkward.
No I’m not a gooner.",0,1750038932.0,redscarepod,5,0.2,False

Watching younger guys make the same mistakes I did, so here's what I wish someone had told me before I learned it the expensive way:

1. Your appearance matters way more than you think. Used to think ""looks don't matter, personality is everything."" That's half true but personality matters, but nobody gets close enough to see your personality if you look like you don't care about yourself. Started lifting weights, buying clothes that fit, and getting decent haircuts. People treat you completely differently. Not fair honestly but I had to live with it.
2. Most career advice is terrible. ""Follow your passion"" and ""do what you love"" sounds nice but pays terribly. Better advice: get good at something valuable, then find ways to enjoy it. Your dream job might be a nightmare with a boss and deadlines. Build skills that pay well first, then pursue passion projects on the side with actual money in the bank.
3. Networking isn't about using people. Spent years thinking networking was fake and sleazy. Turns out it's just being genuinely helpful to people in your field. Answer questions, share opportunities, make introductions. Most good jobs come through connections, not job boards. The guy who helped me get my current role? Met him in a random conversation at a coffee shop.
4. You can't negotiate from a position of weakness. Whether it's salary, relationships, or business deals - you need options to have leverage. Stay in shape so you're not desperate for any relationship. Keep your skills sharp so you're not desperate for any job. Save money so you're not desperate for any paycheck. Desperation kills your negotiating power.
5. Clean eating changes everything .Used to live on pizza, energy drinks, and whatever was convenient. Thought food was just fuel. Started eating actual meals with vegetables and protein. Energy levels stabilized, sleep improved, mood got better, even thinking got clearer. You literally are what you eat - choose accordingly.
6. Your 20s are for building, not consuming. Watched friends blow money on cars, clothes, and experiences while I was learning skills and saving. They looked cooler at 25, I look better at 32. Your 20s are when you have energy but no money. Use that energy to build skills, relationships, and savings. The fancy stuff can wait.
7. Most people don't think about you as much as you think Spent years worried about what others thought of my choices. Turns out most people are too busy worrying about their own stuff to judge yours. That embarrassing thing you did last week? They already forgot. Make decisions based on what's good for you, not what looks good to people who aren't living your life.
8. Confidence comes from competence. ""Just be confident"" is useless advice. Confidence comes from knowing you can handle what comes up. Get good at things that matter fixing problems, making money, staying healthy, building relationships. When you know you can figure stuff out, confidence becomes automatic.
9. Your mental health affects everything else. Used to think therapy was for ""weak"" people and just powered through stress and anxiety. Finally got help at 29. Wish I'd done it at 19. Your brain is like any other part of your body sometimes it needs maintenance. Taking care of your mental health isn't weakness but maintenance.
10. Quality beats quantity in almost everything Better to have 3 close friends than 30 acquaintances. Better to own 5 high-quality items than 50 cheap ones. Better to be great at 2 skills than mediocre at 10. Better to have one meaningful relationship than a bunch of casual ones. Focus your energy on fewer things and do them well. I realized this after how my friend who hone his skill for a decade got a into a big internship after I have applied for it a lot of times.

I hope this helps. I just wanted you guys to learn this lessons. Took me so long and I want to preach it more. So you guys don't go through what I did.

What should I do?,"26F 5’7 sw: 190lbs cw: 171lbs So I’ve been on a weight loss journey for about a year with a personalized plan by a cert nutritionist, I started off strong and started to lose weight right away, then things in my personal life happened that made me lose track for a couple of months.

After I decided to get back on track but I found myself on a weight/gain monthly cycle of just 2lbs (I wasn’t following the diet correctly and I over ate during the weekend).

I got really impatient and decided to cut back on my calories myself (didn’t notify or talked at all with my nutritionist), of around 1200 calories and 30 minutes workouts everyday, it worked great!! And I feel so much better about myself, but I can’t help but notice some symptoms that worry me for example, I feel so sleepy all the time, even after drinking coffee, and it just feels dangerous to keep going with this regime not knowing if I’m putting myself at risk of developing other health issues.

Even tho I’ve struggled a lot physiologically with issues related to body image and keeping this regime has helped a lot, I’m not willing to put my physical health at risk. 

So first of all, am I exaggerating? Are 1200 calories and day with 30 minutes of workout not that low? lol

Do you have any tips so I don’t bounce back after I come back to the calorie deficit set by my nutritionist?",0,1750038191.0,loseit,3,0.5,False

I tried to call ahead around February, but I was told by customer service they don't currently do/schedule tours.  So, we took our chances and just popped in.

While the coffee shop is open, THE GEAR SHOP IS CLOSED INDEFINATLEY.  We spoke with one of the supervisors who talked to their marketing/shop person, and they said that the shop was closed and there were no plans to re-open it.  We were told all sales will be online going forward - which is a real bummer because I wanted a t-shirt, and my wife wanted a Gary.  

They did tell me, however, that we *can* schedule a tour.  They couldn't do one on the spot, but I guess they recently changed their rules, and you can schedule one in advance by going to [rivian.com/support](http://rivian.com/support) and filling out the form, using the chat, or calling.

I'm 26 years old. I work full time ( about 30 hours a week) at a coffee shop. My hours are awful. I work the closing shift 1-10 pm and honestly it takes me almost an hour to an hour and a half to close up properly. I've been working here for about 2 years and still haven't gotten the hang of it. I have an anxious personality so I think that's a part of the problem, but also being a closer is just a lot of work. There is another coworker who she always gets out at exactly 10 and I was going to ask her how she gets done on time, but I just found out there have been complaints about her not doing all her tasks. Whereas no one complains about me but the reality is its taking me way too long to close and I'm annoyed and tired. Even now as I type this 

I have been trying to find a job that like 7-3, 8-5 so I could go to uni after my classes but the reality Is no one is hiring. I had chronic health issues which is whyb I needed to work full time so I could pay for things like physio, massge, etc. However I am getting better now. 

I have an emergency fund of $2000 now as well I saved up from tax refund. 

If I go down to 15 hours a week ( there is an 11-5 shift), I would make $960 a month, after rent I would have $310 left. 

If I work 18 hours a week, then I would have $1152, after rent I would have $502 left. 

There's a part of me that's scared because I know that even with bursaries, money would still be very tight. But i feel like at this point this job is draining and i cannot balance working a closing shift and going to uni. Also I just feel like I am locked out of everything socially. Not like you can have much of a social life with little money lol but I feel like for the past 2 years I haven't had a life. I cannot balance uni with work and I cannot find another job so I have to work within the confines of this one. 

Anyways i feel like I know what I need to do I just needed to type it out. I wanted to work so I could keep saving for my emergency savings fund or maybe even start putting money in a retirement account but I feel like it's not worth it anymore.

Lunch - Chicken breast - pan fried with minimal oil 250gms, sometimes boiled carrots

Dinner - eggs (2 whole + 9 whites), one scoop whey sometimes one/two banana or some watermelon

Two - 3 cups of black coffee per day One scoop or 3gms of creat ( from past 6 months)

On most days, maybe once a month one cheat day if I’m going out with friends where also I try to eat some chicken snacks only and even then I don’t consume any sugar.

Ive progressed well in the gym Started with being not able to bench the bar to 40kg( 20,20)+ bar now

Used to fall when I tried to squat to squatting 70kg + bar

Again had difficult lifting 20kgs deadlift on bar in form to PR of 130kg

He didn't spend fathers day with the twins because he didn't want to bring them to his house (he lives with his parents and he always says his parents are too sick for them to come over) and I didn't want him hanging around my house all day.

He and the twins took a walk this evening after dinner. They decided to go pick up ice cream and bring some back home to me and my oldest son (17M), which was a nice gesture. 

The twins called and asked what kind of ice cream we wanted and if we wanted any mix-ins. My son ordered his. I said chocolate with brownies, as I love brownie sundaes. 

My son's order was perfect. They returned with coffee ice cream with strawberries mixed in for me.
 
I was picking at it while they told me about their walk. They asked what was wrong and told them I guess they misunderstood me because I said chocolate with brownies. 

They told me my ex ordered it and he said it would be fine because I like coffee and strawberries. 
While I do love coffee, I don't like cold coffee in any form. (This isn't something new as I have always disliked cold coffee.)

They put the ice cream in the freezer and said they'll eat it later since I don't like it. 
This feels so deliberate because I refused to let him spend the whole day at my house. It feels like he's trying to make the twins think I'm horrible toward him for no reason. 

AITA for telling them i didn't like the ice cream they brought me? Should I have just eaten it and pretended that I loved it? Am I reading too far into this?",976,1750036986.0,AmItheAsshole,126,0.93,False

When I graduated with my design degree, I thought I’d walk into some artsy startup and build apps that change the world. Spoiler: that didn’t happen.

Instead, I worked at a small marketing firm as a glorified intern. My title was “Marketing Assistant” but I mostly made coffee, fixed PowerPoints, and photoshopped acne off client headshots. It paid $16.25/hrm, barely enough to survive in a city like San Diego. And to make it worse, I lived over an hour away with my mom and two younger siblings. Every day, it was a two-hour commute both ways. Gas, time, energy, I was draining all of it.

I was too tired to apply for better jobs, too broke to move closer, and too embarrassed to admit how stuck I felt. Every night I told myself: ""Just get through this week."" That week turned into five months.

Then one day, I stayed late working on a campaign with the team. Around 2 a.m., I was about to leave when I passed our “Wellness Room”, a space with a couch, dim lighting, even a diffuser and blanket. That night, I was too exhausted to drive. So I closed the door, curled up on the couch, and passed out.

And that gave me an idea.

For the next five months, I secretly lived at my job during the weekdays.

I brought a suitcase and left it in a locked cabinet. I prepped meals, kept a blanket and pillow in the Wellness Room, and used the shower at the gym next door (we had a corporate deal with them). I arrived early, left late, and started using my nights to take free UX design courses online. No commute meant more energy, and actual time, to level up.

No one suspected a thing.

I started building a portfolio. I redesigned a client’s mobile site just for practice, and the creative director was so impressed she let me pitch it. Suddenly I wasn’t just “the assistant”, I was part of the conversation.

Three months later, I landed a freelance gig. Then another. Then I got hired full-time at a design agency. Salary? $70k. Fully remote. I moved into my own place in downtown. Now I light candles in my own living room and laugh thinking about the peppermint diffuser I used to sleep next to at work.

I never told anyone until now. It wasn’t glamorous. It was lonely, sometimes scary, and always weird. But it was mine.

I don’t recommend it. But I understand if someone does something similar. Because when you’re broke and ambitious with no safety net, you get creative. Sometimes rock bottom gives you the clearest view of the ladder you need to build yourself.",2160,1750036920.0,confession,66,0.98,False

Talking to someone new, instantly hitting it off, and then a 3 minute conversation quickly turns into a 3 hour long conversation. It seems that that’s what everyone wants but can’t seemingly find.

But I know I’m not the only one who feels this way.

I don’t want to be the one asking all the questions and putting in all the effort. I just wanna have a good time, share some laughter, and make a friend along the way. Someone to teach me how to play new games, to talk about what are dreams are, and to lend a shoulder during hard times. Something that might stick with me for a while. Where we can eventually meet up and reflect on our journey over a cup of iced coffee and some pastries.

1lcgc96,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lcgc96/im_a_marine_ecologist_and_i_found_something/,I’m a marine ecologist and I found something terrifying in the Pacific,"I’m not a big poster here and mostly stick to my little corners of the internet, but this is something I just need to share. This all happened to me about a year ago and since then, it has completely taken over my life. I hope my message can be spread here, as I’m not sure where else to put it. 

I’m a student at a small college on the Pacific coast. I’ve been aiming for a masters in marine ecology. But due to the college’s size, let’s just say options for apprenticeship were rather scarce for my field. The marine ecology I was studying mainly focused on the impact that pollution had on the ocean and how this affected local wildlife. 

So you can imagine my surprise when my professor called me to his desk after class. He told me a group of ecologists approached him looking for students to help with a research project. He explained that I seemed like a good fit. He said I was motivated, had good grades, and took my studies seriously. He explained that he forwarded my email address to them and that I should expect a message by that evening. 

Sure enough, later that night, an email had arrived in my inbox. “Good day Miss Kern, we’ve heard from Professor Du Page that you are the top of your class and a highly active advocate for ocean conservation. We humbly invite you to accompany us on an expedition to the North Pacific to observe the effect pollution has on the gyres in the area. This trip will be in three weeks time, so make preparations accordingly. 

The three weeks seemed to drag by, until finally the date approached and I packed my bags. Strangely, they only give me the address two nights before the day we were supposed to cast off. With my suitcase and food in my trunk, I headed off to the boat docks. It was early, about 6 am and the fog was just beginning to retreat into the shelter of the dark forested hills above the city. As I arrived at the harbor parking lot, I saw three men standing beside a silver truck. The shortest of the men, with a white beard, swept back hair and glasses gave a large sweeping wave as he spotted me. As I pulled into the spot next to them, the other two men watched me coldly. 

“Ah, look at you so timely!” The short bearded man flashed a smile at me and  stuck out his hand. “I’m Doctor Krutchek, but you can just call me Dan.”

I learned that Doctor Krutchek was a marine ecologist like myself and was the one who had talked to my professor. He then introduced me to the other two. 

“Guys, I’d like you to meet Jennifer Kern!”

“Just Jenn is fine…”

“Ah well I see. Anyway, Jenn, this is our Captain Charlie Blake.”

“Pleasure to meet you Miss Kern.” Charlie smiled thinly. Charlie LOOKED like a captain. Medium stocky build, a short black beard with some silver peaking through, and a brow that seemed to be in a permanent furrow, his pale blue eyes barely shining through. 

“And this is Mr. Hayes and Mr. Edwards. They’re actually the one who helped finance this operation. Department of the Interior! Wouldn’t have been able to do this without them!” 

“A pleasure Miss Kern.” Mr. Hayes was a tall skinny man with perfectly combed hair. He had a skinny face and what can best be described as a resting annoyed face. Mr. Edwards simply nodded. He looked almost identical to Mr Hayes save a mole on his left cheek. 

“Well, let’s get your luggage on board! We want to be at least 7 miles from the coast within the next 3 hours.”

Captain Blake helped carry my luggage out to the dock where our vessel awaited. The boat was about the size of a small fishing trawler, with a cabin above, a below deck with sleeping bunks and a small lab room at the back for analysis. On the side of the boat in faded blue font was the name Monsoon. 

“Before I bought her, she was a mere fishing trawler,” explained Dan. 

“Yeah, I could tell,” I said looking at the rust stains running down the white sides of the cabin from even rustier bolts. 

Charlie took my bags down to the bunk room. The space was surprisingly roomy considering the canon size and you could stretch your arms wide and still have a foot of space between the walls. 

With a growl of the old diesel engine (counterintuitive to our cause I know), we pulled away from the dock to begin our journey. The sun was just starting to rise above the ocean as we officially entered open water. Our destination, the middle of the North Pacific gyre. In this gyre is what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. If garbage makes it’s way into the Pacific, chances are it’ll wind up there. As Dr Krutchek explained, “Our mission here will be to assess the effect the garbage mass has had on the local wildlife. Then Mr. Hayes and Mr. Edwards can report back on what can be done.” 

I nodded along to what he said but kept looking over at the two agents. Something about them gave me an upset feeling in my gut. They seemed cold, and calculated. Yeah Charlie seemed tough, but he had a genuine quality to him. The two DOI men lacked both of those qualities.

We had spent the  whole day out at sea and I can already feel the boredom creeping in. Not even a gaggle of mystery books and old marine biology textbooks could satiate me. According to the Captain, we would be arriving within the other reaches of the patch by tomorrow afternoon. 


Despite it being my first time sleeping on a boat, the waves were gentle enough to lull me to sleep. I was awoken by faint conversation coming from the small kitchenette to the left of the bunk room. I clearly heard Dr Krutchek’s voice and one of the agents. They sounded the damn same. “Listen agent, be reasonable, we’re going at the best pace we can. It takes time to truly analyze these areas.”

“Our superiors need a report immediately, Dr. If we don't, we won’t think twice about cutting all funding to your research.”

“Fine. We should be nearing the area soon.” I heard Dan stomp up the steps to the main deck. I quietly slipped out of my bunk and got dressed. Due to the cramped quarters, I’d take all the privacy I could get. The thought of being the only woman on a boat of men was still playing at the back of my mind. 

I got a cup of coffee from the old Keurig machine in the kitchenette before heading up after the doctor. He was leaning against the railing, stewing to himself. I leaned on the deck next to him. “I heard you guys talking.”

Dan looked up, his brow furrowing in concern. “Oh, sorry you had to hear that Jenn.” He sighed. It’s just, I’ve been trying to do some more research in that area and now that I have the chance, I have the fucking government breathing down my back. I feel stuck.” 

I put a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Well, it sucks they’re breathing down your neck, but at least they’re showing interest in us, eh?” 

“Yeah Jenn, I suppose you’re right.”

While I was trying to keep the doctor upbeat, this just further stoked my suspicions and anger towards the agents aboard with us. 

I wandered into the cab to see Captain Charlie puzzling over some instruments and then looking to the horizon ahead. “The fuck?.” I asked him what the matter was and he pointed to his instruments. It was then I noticed that they were all going ballistic. Gauge needles flicking two and fro. “I’m not sure what’s happening, it’s like someone is waving a big magnet over the controls.” 

Just as he said that, a huge jolt hit the ship, what sounded like metal against metal scraping from below. The whole boat felt like it jolted up, as if it went over a speed bump. “The Hell was that!?” The Professor ran into the doorway, holding the frame in case another tremor shook the boat. 

“I don’t know, I didn’t see anything on the radar, but, well, look at it.” Sure enough, the radar seemed to be glitching in and out. Almost completing a rotation and then fading out. “I’ve never seen anything like it.” Charlie sounded worried and this worried me. If our captain didn’t know what was happening, we were screwed. 

Something else I noticed was that the sun was getting low on the horizon. Strange, it felt like it was just noon a half hour ago.

 “Well folks, looks like we’re gonna have to stop here for the night.” Charlie shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t want to push forward at all while the instruments are all fuddled. Especially since we’re losing daylight.”

 It was disappointing to hear, but Dan and I agreed that would be for the best. As I went out on the deck, I saw the two agents quietly talking to each other. I couldn’t make out much but something did stick out to me. Something something “Zone T.”

My sleep was rough that night. I kept having dreams about walking through the lab at my school. Shelves lined with specimens in formaldehyde, all of them screaming…

When I woke up, it was barely light out. Something felt off but I couldn’t quite place it. As if something was out of place. Looking at the small glass of water by my bedside, I realized what it was. The water was NOT moving. For the last couple of days, everything on the boat had a constant sway and bob, even at the waters calmest. But that’s not the case now. Confused, I made my way to the kitchenette and out the door to the deck. I was surprised to see everyone…including the captain, out on the deck. I paced out onto the deck to ask what was going on, then I looked for myself. We were no longer on water. But we weren’t on land either. 

As far as the eye could see on all sides was a sprawling landscape made of waste. A flat plain of garbage, and out on that plain, the rusted hulls of ocean freighters lay, like beached whales. “Where the fuck are we,” I muttered almost to myself. 

I felt a hand pat my shoulder and I whirled around to see one of the agents. He was smiling. “Welcome to Zone T.”


I looked over at the doctor who looked just as dumbfounded as me. The captain, on the other hand, had a neutral expression on his face. 

“We needed some seasoned marine biologists to assist us in research of this area, but no one who would be missed or have the notoriety to tell. No offense.”

The Doctor's mouth opened and closed as he processed the information, scouring the landscape. “This…this is impossible. Something like this should have shown up on satellites, and been recorded long before. How can this place exist.”

“We’ve made great effort to make sure people don’t enter this area doctor, and as for satellite imagery, we still don’t know why it doesn’t show up there. 

As I wandered aimlessly along the deck, the smell hit me. It was unlike the normal sea smell you imagine. It smelled like pure rot, like the gunk you pull out of a drain when you unclog it. There was a denseness to the air, almost muggy. 

It’s hard to think just hours before we were in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The captain and the two agents were yelling on the other end of the deck. 

“I didn’t fucking sign up for this! Listen you suits, I don’t know what you’re pulling but I demand some damned answers!”

Mr. Edwards regarded him coolly, a faint smirk of contempt crossing his face.  

“Legends have been told of this place for thousands of years. It was considered by various tribes to be the gates of the underworld, or a place so evil the water refused to touch it. But it’s not an island, it’s a place simply with an absence of water.”

“The hell does that even mean?”

“You’ve heard of the Bermuda Triangle? Well this is the real one. We weren’t sure if it existed until about 70 years ago. Only through some advanced coordination methods were we able to find it.” 

“Why has it been kept secret for so long?” I asked. 

“Because people keep disappearing. Things in this place behave strangely as you can see.” He nodded towards the cabin and instruments that were presumably still going haywire. 

“As I said, it doesn’t appear on satellite maps and only seems accessible at certain times of the year. Normally the area around it is closely guarded by a periphery of our ships. But they let us through of course.”

Dan stepped forward. “Then why us? What makes us so special?”

“You’re expendable.” Hayes smiled thinly. 

I felt like my intestines punched my stomach. 

“Excuse me!?” Dan stared agape at the two men. 

“If we got the nation's top marine biologists, ecologists, and captains, they’d be missed. We’ve checked all your records. Most of you are completely alone.”

Captain Charlie made a dash at Hayes. In an instant, Hayes whirled around pulling out a 9 mm and shot him in the foot. Charlie cried in agony and tumbled to the floor, clutching his foot. I rushed into the cabin, rummaging through the aging first aid kit to retrieve a pack of gauze. I helped pull Charlie’s shoe off to reveal his blood soaked sock. Fortunately it had just grazed the top of his foot but it had still cut deep. Charlie winced as I wrapped the gauze around his foot while Dan held him up. 

I wanted to yell at the two men in suits, but I had a man’s safety to focus on. And I was scared shitless. Considering I’m the shut in nerd that I am, I never thought I would witness someone get shot. 

“Even if you did succeed at overtaking us, we not only have our colleagues surrounding you, you are currently in one of the most uncharted and hostile places on the globe.” Hayes loomed over us smugly. 

We helped Charlie to his feet and hobbled him over to the cabin wall. He glared like a cornered animal at the two agents. 

“So what do you want us to do here?” Dan said, shifting uncomfortably next to us. 

“When we arranged this mission we said everything would be provided and we did not lie. You will find wetsuits, boots, autopsy tools and preservation containers. You will also be provided with weapons.” 

Dan turned his head to the agents. “Weapons?”

“It’s just a precaution,” agent  Edwards said matter-of-factly. 

At that point, the place we found ourselves in truly began to sink in. Sure we were scientists but to be one of a few people in a place beyond understanding? It genuinely frightened me. Ancient maps with sea monsters at their edges labeled “there be monsters here” flashed through my head. 

The agents led us to the back, presenting us with everything you might possibly need in a place in the middle of the ocean that defied the laws of physics. Once we were suited up in our gear, the agents opened up a lock box with 5 strange looking devices in them. They were long black poles, about the width of a can and they had a two pronged end that made it look like a spear that a little imp would flail around. 

“These are your weapons. Enough electricity in them to render a rhino unconscious. It should help at least ward off anything that comes your way.”

“Yeah, well what is it?” Charlie asked, limping over to us. 

The agents remained silent, passing the stun spears to us. 

“Fucking alright then.” Charlie grumbled, hobbling back to his folding chair brought from below. 

Edwards tossed Charlie a cane. “You’ll be our guard considering your recent…incapacitation.”

Charlie glared up at him but said nothing. The agents unhinged the gangway and it fell heavily to the “floor” with a squelching sound. With a grim nod from the agents, we stepped down the gangway and into the wilderness before us. 
 
The ground below us was semi soft and fibery. Like we were walking on a giant wicker chair. Parts of rusted shapes and masses of garbage stuck out of the ground. All while a faint rumbling permeated the air. We approached the rusted bow of one ship which was covered in some sort of vine. I took out a scalpel to cut a piece off, and as I did, the vine(?) made a hissing sound and zipped away. With a rumble, the whole mass of vines began moving, like a giant slithering tumbleweed, and it moved like a caterpillar over the bow of the ship and disappeared into a hole in the ground.

“Those things are harmless, unless you stay still too long,” Edwards remarked emotionlessly. 

I looked down at the little piece of tendril, wriggling around on its own at our feet. I picked it up gingerly and placed it quickly into one of the sample cases, where it wriggled as if objecting to its imprisonment. The vine reminded me of a certain kind of plant I saw when I was a kid when my family visited my grandma in Georgia. The plant was called kudzu. It grew over anything, choking the life out of other plants. It also grew incredibly fast. This stuff was faster. 

With a new sense of unease among our group, we kept moving further in. The structures around us seemed to decay further. Some of them didn’t even look like any sort of structural design built by man, let alone a boat. Dan and I collected a few more samples before Edwards directed us to head back towards camp.

As we approached the boat, I became aware of a strange sound. It was like grinding, but wet. As if someone were running a semi-picked over chicken bone on a picket fence. It wouldn’t take long  to learn what the noise was. 

On the deck of the ship was what was left of Captain Charlie. Towering over him was a beast the likes of which I had ever seen. Had it not been moving, it looked like something that could never have been alive. Its “skin” was made of what looked like wet cloth or plastic, stretched raggedly over its frame. Bits of metal stuck out from this covering, acting like its bones. It stood on all fours, made of what looked like harpoons. I happened to look to my left to see a bloodied Agent Hayes, clutching his gun tightly and looking at me desperately. He crept over to me silently.

“That…thing came out of nowhere. He didn’t stand a chance. I didn’t even have time to get to the radio. It-it didn’t even react to my bullets. It just fucking stared at me.”

The being turned slightly making us both crouch down. We ducked behind a rusted piece of metal, seeing the other two a further way off. I was able to see its face. Part of it looked like a shark skull, the right half of its jaw hanging limp. Most of it was covered in moss, as if it had been around for a long time. I saw what was making the grinding sound. Sticking out of the skull was a rusted and freshly bloodied saw blade, which it was currently using to saw into the captain's face. 

Quietly, Hayes and I backtracked to the others, only to have my blood run cold as I accidentally kicked a shred of scrap metal that sounded like nails on a chalkboard. The beast spun its “head” around with a sort of clanking sound, like a roller coaster going up it's hill, and although it didn’t have visible eyes, I knew it saw us.
 
It dropped what was left of the captain's head, looking now more like a squashed watermelon and leapt over the deck toward us. 

“Fucking run for it!!!” Hayes yelled. 

The beast sprinted forward on its harpoon legs at a terrifying speed. It’s buzzsaw mouth spinning menacingly. A shrill scream broke out behind us. Against my better judgement I looked behind me. It was Hayes who screamed. Wrapped around his leg was a black tendril that looked like a steel cable. The cable led to the mouth of the beast, which now seemed to be drooling a black oily substance. Hayes screamed in horror as the beast began reeling him in like a fish on a line. 

While Edwards and I stared frozen in shock, I saw a blur run between us over to Hayes. With a yell, Dan brought his stun sword onto the tendril. The beast let out a garbled screech and the tendril rapidly retracted. Hayes fell away scrambling backwards as Dan stood his ground. 

Dan and the beast stood about 10 feet apart, him holding the stun cane in front of him like a lion tamer. The beast seemed confused by this, its blade now twitching back and forth in a way that seemed almost hesitant. Just as it seemed like the beast was ready to turn tail, I heard a clunking sound from somewhere above us. 

Descending from one of the cliff-like shipwrecks was a giant spider-like creature. It looked familiar then I realized it looked like a giant bacteriophage virus. Spider legs, a body like a screw, and a diamond shaped head. Before we had time to react it pounced onto Hayes, pinning him with two of its legs. A long hose extended from its middle and I saw the glint of a long needle at the end. 

The needle shot down, injecting itself into Hayes’ stomach. He howled with pain and Edwards threw up next to me. After a few agonizing seconds the giant virus pulled out the needle and  toddled its way toward Dan and the beast. Dan quickly ducked out of the way and the bacteriophage and the beast began fighting, slashing metal limbs at each other. As before, the virus pinned one of the creature's legs and injected it the same way it had Hayes. 

As I had apparently become the nurse of this operation, I began inspecting Hayes’ injury. It was shockingly clean. 

“How much pain are you feeling?”

“I don’t know. Not that much actually. I feel fine actually.” 

It was then that he started laughing. Not a good natured laugh but a strange, forced, almost pained laugh. 

“It tickles!!! It tickles!!!!” 

He began burping loudly, although they sounded more like gasps between his mad cackling. I also noticed his eyes were practically bulging out of their sockets. And then they did…

I screamed as his eyeballs ruptured spraying fluid over me and Edwards. Hayes’ laughter turned to screaming as he continued burping. As he burped, long wriggling silver things came out of his mouth, wriggling down his body and onto the ground like silvery living shoelaces. He abruptly stopped screaming and gained a peaceful expression on his face. 

Out of his eye sockets came two thicker versions of the worms slithering out of his mouth. I could see now that most of his visible skin seemed to be wriggling. The worm's heads ballooned into black orbs and I realized they had effectively become eye stalks. 

A deep garbled voice issued from the stained black mouth of the former Agent Hayes. 

“ Your friend is no more, for his body has become our nutrients and outlet.”

I heard a crash as the beast fell over sideways and began to spasm on the ground. More of the little worms began to crawl out of its joints. It then stood up, eerily calm as if in a trance. 

“Call your people for backup.” Not Hayes looked over at a mortified Edwards. “I am satiated for now. You may only contact them because I permit it. This is not a land for you. If you stay, you shall become muck, as you were all before. Behind every clock are fine tuned gears, and if you poke into those gears too much, you may get pinched. It is in your nature as scientists to question, but stay back for now. You may retrieve your answer at some point, but not now. Now go.”

Edwards walkie emitted a high pitched screeching sound. Not Hayes scampered away in a way no humans’ joints should be capable of. The saw faced creature followed behind, almost like some sort of loyal guardian. I heard a helicopter approaching in the distance. 

Everything moved super fast from there. I’d like to say Dan Krutchek and I kept in touch, but that would be a lie. I never saw him again.  I never really learned what branch of the government was responsible for this. I’m beginning to think it wasn’t even the government.  

I just remember people dressed in tactical gear helping to board the chopper, but not before gathering up our samples and putting them in a steel chest. I remember Dan shooting me a glance as they drove me home from the port when we made landfall. I wish I stayed with him. 

I’ve been studying the Pacific ever since. Going onto conspiracy sites no self respecting scientist would ever humor looking at. Eventually I was able to piece together a mosaic of sources. A Polynesian mythology site here, a ship triangulation log there, until I was fairly certain of the coordinates. 

I was somehow able to convince the school to give me a small grant for my research. I somehow knew if I showed up, whatever those forces that were there wouldn’t stop me. As I set about packing my things, I now had one goal. I wished not to stick my fingers in the gears of the world but become them. I shall become muck, as I was before. I’m looking at my arm now as I watch it writhe and twitch. 

To whoever reads this, lmk, and I’ll get you the coordinates. We all deserve to return to the machine, to the muck. Hopefully this is your call.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I wasn’t planning to post again unless something changed. I figured I’d just wait it out, maybe talk to her again when I had the nerve. But today’s Father’s Day, and I’ve been out at my dad’s place most of the day. Just the two of us. We talked a little about everything that’s been going on—I didn’t go into full detail, but enough that he could tell something wasn’t sitting right with me.

He doesn’t think she’s cheating either. But he didn’t really have an explanation for the rest of it. Just told me to trust my gut and don’t let myself get talked out of what I know I saw.

Emily was out too—said she was visiting a coworker. I didn’t ask questions. I just needed space.

The truth is, more things have happened over the past few days. I’ve been trying to stay calm, trying not to read too much into every little thing. But it’s getting harder to explain some of this away. None of it’s huge on its own—but put together, it’s getting hard to ignore.

1. A package showed up yesterday morning.
It wasn’t addressed to Emily, but to E. Marlowe. Even though it wasn’t in her name, she snatched it the second it landed on the porch and said, “Oh, that’s just something I ordered under an old account.”

Weird part? There was no postal barcode, no shipping label. Just a return address:
Div 7B—Clearance Verified
Portland, OR
And instead of a stamp, it had what looked like a black wax seal, already cracked open. I found the torn label in the trash under coffee grounds.

2. Her journal moved again.
She always locks it. I’ve never touched it. But this morning, I woke up and it was sitting on my desk. Open. When I walked over, she came out of the bathroom and immediately closed it. Said she’d been “writing and forgot to put it away.”

Thing is—it was sitting on top of a drawer where I keep personal letters. One envelope looked like it had been opened and resealed with tape—sloppily, like someone was in a hurry.

3. The phone thing (again).
I mentioned this before, but that same app—the one with no name, just a black background and a white dot in the middle—popped up again. This time I actually saw it open when she picked up her phone. The screen was nearly black, just a spinning icon in the center and a faint countdown ticking at the bottom.

When she noticed me looking, she tilted the screen away and said it was “just part of her meditation timer,” then closed it. I didn’t push, but when I checked later (I know, I know), it was gone, just like last time. Not minimized. Not in her app list. Just… gone.

Whatever it is, it only ever shows up when she thinks I’m not looking. I still haven’t found anything like it online.

4. The mirror thing.
This morning, while brushing my teeth, I saw her in the mirror—standing behind me in the hallway. Clear as day. I turned around immediately… but no one was there. Not in the bedroom. Not in the bathroom. Nowhere.

She was in the kitchen. Said she’d been there for ten minutes. When I told her what I saw, she just smiled and said, “I guess you’re starting to see me the way I really am,” then laughed like it was a joke.

I didn’t laugh.

5. The voicemail.
This one might just be a glitch, but… I got a missed call this afternoon from a blocked number. The voicemail was just static and this faint, whispery voice that I swear sounded like her. I couldn’t make out what it said. I played it twice. Then when I went back later—it was gone. Just shows up now as a 0:00 blank message.

I know how all of this sounds. I’ve been trying to write it out just to convince myself I’m not imagining things. I’ve been double-checking everything, rereading messages, re-checking times. I’ve even started sleeping worse, like my brain won’t let go of the feeling that something’s off in ways I can’t explain.

I told my dad some of it, but I left out the mirror thing. I don’t know why—it just felt like saying it out loud would make it real in a way I’m not ready for.

It’s not just one lie anymore. It’s like I’m living with someone I don’t recognize—but she still smiles the same, talks the same, laughs at my jokes.

And I don’t know what’s scarier, the idea that she’s hiding something from me…

…or that the person I’m living with isn’t the same one I fell for.

I keep telling myself I’m overreacting. But what if I’m not?

My dad said I should give it a little more time—maybe a week—but that I can’t keep avoiding the conversation. If she still can’t give me a straight answer after that, I need to seriously consider whether I can stay in this relationship. And he’s right. Whatever this is… it can’t keep going like this.",1,1750036715.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

I got the couch since thats the best I could find in my budget. Now I need help decorating the rest of the living room around it. I have added decoration inspo as well. The vibe I am looking for is I NEED good balance of colors! I want to add tons of paintings. I want to add books, a vinyl player, I have some antique chinaware from japan to decorate. And really blend antique pieces in a modern layout. I am also planning to add tons of plants for greenery. Most of the things I have bought and added is vintage/second hand.

My plan so far is to hang the TV and add frames around it. Have a console just below the tv. Add vinyl player the corner next to tv. Replace the working desk with a small breakfast nook with a table and two chairs. I want to add 2 accent chairs(want a rocking chair too😁), a vintage coffee table and a good persian style rug.

1lcgbcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/1lcgbcp/talking_on_the_phone_in_public_isnt_annoying/,Talking on the phone in public isn’t annoying,"Oftentimes someone talking on the phone is seen rude and a disturbance especially on speakerphone but I don’t see why. Phone calls in general are seen as a hassle when compared to a quick message but disagree. 

Whether it’s the airport, at a restaurant, or coffee, or even outside it’s something that can be easily ignored and overlooked. Conversations between two happen all the time and their convo isn’t any different from 2 people talking IRL. Hell, I’d say the 2 people IRL are more of a disturbance than the one person on their phone. 

And as a bonus those phone calls are usually talking about some out of pocket subjects I find hilarious and relatable. I’m not an eavesdropper but when I do hear things I can’t help but laugh. People tend to censor themselves more face to face so you won’t be hearing the lady behind you at the store and how her son broke the TV with a “hidden” sex toy. 

I just think people find a problem with others for the simplest things. I say this as a student who moved away for college and calls family on a daily basis but also as an advocate for more calling instead of texting. It’s easier and you don’t feel the pressure to answer messages when you don’t have the time to. ",25,1750036668.0,The10thDentist,50,0.58,False
