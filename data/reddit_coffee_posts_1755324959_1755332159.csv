**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.


---

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Extra Step That Helped

Reviewed all wrong answers in ChatGPT (compared against SH’s “suggested correct answer”):
	•	If there was a mismatch, I asked ChatGPT to explain why SH’s answer might be more appropriate.
	•	Realized both SH & ChatGPT can be wrong at times, but the combo really helped me understand the logic + PMI mindset.
	•	Made quick notes from these reviews for last-minute brush-up. I also used chat got to dive deeper into topics to understand them properly( had uploaded pmbok7 and process guide as knowledge base)

Timeline & Reality
	•	Initially planned exam for Aug 12, but couldn’t study for 3 days before that due to personal reasons, so postponed to Aug 15.
	•	Booked the exam on the night before (Aug 14).
	•	Didn’t wear blue.
	•	Unlike the plan, spent the whole day before the exam studying and revising.
	•	Took the second mock with earplugs, realized it improved focus, so used them in the exam center too.
	•	Had coffee and water during the breaks. Used eye drops frequently at my desk and anti-glare glasses helped.
	•	No formula or drag-and-drop questions appeared in my exam — it was heavily mindset + situational focused.
	•	Booked an afternoon slot since I’d been waking up late every day during prep, and I didn’t want to force an early schedule on exam day.",1,1755331748.0,pmp,0,1.0,False

1mron7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamIntentionAcademy/comments/1mron7m/day_18100_coffee/,Day 18/100 • Coffee,"Don’t underestimate caffeine. Coffee has several well-documented benefits for your brain when consumed in moderate amounts. Just remember not to drink it late into the day or at night unless you want to be up for hours - which is what has happened to me tonight 🫠

Seriously though, there are great benefits to getting your dreams on course with a good cup of joe. I make a good cup every morning just right with a special recipe that was inspired by a friend on a camping trip out in Polihale on Kauai in Hawaii. It involves cinnamon, fresh turmeric, black pepper, pink sea salt, honey - and I just started adding shilajit and a mixture of all the good powdered mushrooms. You can look up all the benefits of all these other goodies or maybe I will post about them later, here’s the skinny on just good ol’ coffee:

### Cognitive & Mental Benefits

> Improved Alertness & Focus - Caffeine blocks adenosine (a neurotransmitter that promotes sleepiness), helping you feel more awake and attentive.

> Enhanced Memory & Learning - Some studies suggest caffeine may temporarily boost short-term memory and learning capacity, particularly for tasks that require focus.

> Better Reaction Time - Coffee can sharpen your reflexes and decision-making speed, which is why many people rely on it in demanding situations.

⸻

### Brain Health & Protection

> Neuroprotective Effects - Long-term coffee drinkers show a lower risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, likely due to caffeine’s effect on brain signaling and antioxidants in coffee.

> Mood Regulation - Caffeine increases dopamine and serotonin activity, which can lift mood and reduce the risk of depression in some people.

⸻

### Energy & Productivity

> Boosted Motivation - By stimulating dopamine pathways, coffee can make tasks feel more rewarding, which helps with motivation and productivity.

> Supports Endurance for Mental Work - Like for physical exercise, caffeine can help sustain mental energy for long study or work sessions.

1mroh2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpeculativeFictionHub/comments/1mroh2e/the_era_of_interfaces/,The Era of Interfaces,"They kissed for the first time in silence. Not because there were no words, but because in their time words were optional. A thought could become a print, a print could be sent, and the other could feel it as if it were their own. Lira could have shown Kai exactly what trembled inside her chest — the pull of desire, the flicker of fear, the strange calm beneath it. He could have returned his own storm in kind. But they chose the old way, mouths meeting in the half-dark, the print withheld.

And even then, something fractured.  
For Lira, the kiss was belonging, a home opening. For Kai, it was vertigo, a cliff’s edge. Both felt the same emotions — heat, urgency, trembling — yet their feelings diverged the moment they filtered them.

That was the paradox everyone lived with in the age of the Absolute Atomic Language: **emotions traveled perfectly, but feelings did not**.

Later, in bed, they sent prints. Pleasure, desire, exhaustion, intimacy. The exchange was flawless; the fidelity undeniable. And yet, the results were irreconcilable. Lira received communion; Kai received doubt. Lira felt a wholeness spreading through her; Kai felt power shading into loneliness.

This was the truth of their time: the Language could transmit the raw universals — joy, fear, anger, desire, sorrow, surprise — but once those universals passed through the prism of a person, they fractured into feelings. And those prisms could not be erased.

Some philosophers had concluded that love itself did not exist. It was only a word, a mask for different storms. One person’s “love” was tenderness and admiration; another’s was jealousy, drama, domination; another’s pure pain. The only thing that unified them were the outcomes: closeness, sacrifice, possession, grief. Love was not a thing, they said, but a convenient illusion, and the word ""love"" is just a placeholder.

Lira hated this theory. She told Kai once, over coffee: “If love doesn’t exist, then what do I feel for you?” He looked down at his cup. He had received her print — every joy and every tremor — but in his prism it had become vertigo.

Scientists meanwhile studied the voids, the silences. They devised a scale: intentional silences —a rest in music, a pause in poetry, a chosen quiet in intimacy— tended to harmony. Accidental silences —misunderstandings, rejections, awkward gaps— leaned toward chaos.

But even science betrayed itself. Lira once lay beside him after sex, offering only silence. Measured in a lab, it would have been harmonic, ordered. In Kai’s chest it was chaos, a black hole.

Art had once seemed different, a domain apart. But people came to see that art, too, was an interface. Artists had always been proto-engineers of ambiguity, designing gateways where universal emotions passed into individual feelings. A brushstroke, a blank page, a pause between notes — these were early languages, long before the Atomic one.

And now, the boundaries dissolved. A parent’s print of hearing their baby sing for the first time could be as moving as a music masterpiece. Art hadn’t vanished, but its definition had collapsed. The interface had spread everywhere. Life itself was art, because life itself was an endless interface of universality and individuality.

One evening, walking under a neon sign, Lira stopped and sent Kai everything. Her devotion, her fear, her longing, her pain. He received it all, and in her prism it was love. In his, it was vertigo.

And yet, he didn’t turn away. In their era, people had grown used to these collisions. Prints of strangers poured into them daily — storms of otherness so different they were at times incomprehensible. Exposure had made them more open to difference, more willing to dwell in the foreignness of another’s storm.

But openness was not always enough. Some prints overwhelmed, left wounds, carved absences that no harmony could soothe. What you felt from another might be impossible to carry, impossible to reconcile with your own.

Lira and Kai stood in the glow of the sign, joined and divided at once. Neither harmony nor chaos, but something in between, a resonance that shifted each time they breathed.

And in that silence —not quite chosen, not quite accidental— it seemed to both that another dimension pressed close, whispering through the voids, reminding them that what made them human was not what they shared, but what they could never make the same.",1,1755330419.0,SpeculativeFictionHub,0,1.0,False

1mrogvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mrogvl/a_lost_chance_at_love/,A Lost Chance At Love?,"So the other night, I was chilling downstairs in the living room watching a series. There was a scene where this one character kissed another character's hand and in that moment, seeing that randomly reminded me of a memory which was suppresed in my brain for so long. Something similar that happened to me, a while back. 

It took me back to years ago, when I was still in college. I knew a guy (He was my senior) and he was quite friendly with me. He was very sweet, kind and gentlemanly 🥺. However, we were never like 'actual' friends or anything (Heck, I never even had his number either) and he was someone who I would often see around in campus and chat with, if I came across him. 

On this particular day, I was dressed for a college function and was waiting around the coffee corner area for some friends. The guy sees me from afar, and comes over to greet me. He also noticed that i was dolled up and then he did the most unexpected thing; He gently took my hand... ..kissed it..and said, ""Ohh you look really pretty. ☺️"" 

I stood there, frozen. My mind went blank, I felt like I short-circuited. I was blushing so hard. From the outside I looked fine, but internally I was freaking out being like ""Um..u-uh..um..um.😳"" I  was going crazy! 

The problem is...when that happened..I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!😭. Didn't even say a word to him, because I was so shocked! And fast-forward to the present, it's now years and the guy is already gone, wherever he is right now. He could be dating someone, or married, I don't even know! 

I told a friend of mine about this, and she straight up said to me, ""This is some Old Disney level stuff!!🥰 He clearly had a thing for you, flirted with you and YOU DIDN'T EVEN catch the hint!!!"" And now that I look back at it upon realisation; It's true, I was so dumb back then. 🥲

Now i have no recollection of who he was, nor his face or name. All I can remember is how he was as a person. And how I missed out on a HUGE opportunity at getting with him. Feeling extremely bummed out about it, currently :,D

1mroczz,https://www.reddit.com/r/OverexplainedEmotions/comments/1mroczz/if_youve_ever_experienced_slight_disappointment/,"If You've Ever Experienced Slight Disappointment from a Coffee Shop Visit, Read This","Upon engaging in my routine morning pilgrimage to the neighborhood coffee establishment, I encountered a stimulus-event that precipitated an emoitonal wave of nebulous, low-intensity disappointmennt. This emotional response, which I have taken the liberty of categorizing as a 'micro-disconance', unfollded following an interaction with the menu board—an interaction brimming with expectation, only to culminate in a muted acknowledgment of reality's divergence from my annticipatory model.

The catalyst for this experience aroe when a glance at the board registered with my pre-caffeine visual receptors. I had—based on prior cognitive schema—anticipated the prominent 'Pumpikn Spice Latte' (PSL) highlight. To my mild chagrin, this anticipation was met with the stark absecne of the sezsonal beverage. Instead, its usual emplacement had been overtaken by a more mundane 'Hazelnut Joy'.

This sequence of events initiated a multi-step cognitive appraisal process: initially, there was a rapid, subconacious recall of past taste stimuuli associated with PSL, followed by a tangential neural activation of 'autumnal coziness'. The absence of expected stimuli triggered a reevaluation of sensory input, causing a recalibration of hedonic expectations, temporarily registering as discontent.

The physiological markers accompanying this emotional state were subttle but idenntifiable—a slight, but discernible drop in the corners of the lips, paired with a near-imperceptible sigh that likely altered diaphragm pressure parameters. Interestingly, the autonomic nervous system involvement was minimal, as evidenced by the lack of significant heart rate fluctuation, suggestnig the disappointing factor was indeed of low intensity.

This exploratory documentation serves as an archetype of cauaslity within micro-emotional landscapes, emphasizing how minuscule variances between expectation and reaity can tip the sclae ever so slightly towards disappointment. While this emotional encounter was short-lived, it compels one to consider the profound complexity underpinning even our seemingly trivial affective experiences. Is it truly the missing PSL causing the dissonance, or is this a metaphor for unmet life expectations? 🤔",7,1755330042.0,OverexplainedEmotions,0,1.0,False
1mroc33,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mroc33/i_might_have_seen_the_most_beautiful_girl_ive/,"I might have seen the most beautiful girl I've ever laid my eyes upon, now I don't know what to think.","My family decided to plan a 2-Week trip across Europe, as of writing we are on our 11th day on on a Train to Paris, I wasn't exactly thrilled about the timeframe but what can you do?

We were set to spend our 7th to 10th days in Munich, Germany. It was delightful, with our fourth day having no scheduled tours, so we just went where we pleased. I proposed to go to the English Garden, as one of our tour guides suggested it to us the day prior.

I was sort of surprised to discover that the hot weather, combined with the raging rapid river all around the park, this park was basically treated like a beach, people in swimwear, sunbathing, playing volleyball, swimming in the river, heck, at the very entrance of the park is a bump in the water with a full line and audience standing, watching people absolutely shred the water with their surf boards, you could tell who was a tourist and who was a local solely based on who came with or without beachwear. We continued our stroll through the garden when a sign caught our eye, it had two symbols on it, a ""No swimming"", and the other with a literal Skull on it, all this with the river in the back just full of people enjoying themselves in the water, my family and I found this funny so we stopped to watch a bit.

Here's when it happened.

As I was chuckling at the sheer absurdity of what was going on, I heard another family next to us also chuckling, guessing they also found it funny, I turned to look, which is when I saw her. Before I saw anything else, I laid my eyes on the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. Long blonde hair, dashing brown eyes, wearing a stunning white floral dress, looked about my height and age, it was indescribable, it was as if everything else just became slightly darker and quieter for about 3 seconds. I quickly looked away since I didn't want to make anything weird.

A bit of context about me. I don't expect many, if any of you to believe me when I say this, but every single one of my past crushes has been solely because of personality, not once have I been attracted to someone because of their physical, in fact, I always found the whole concept of being interested in someone solely because of the way they looked to be simply immoral, how ""Love at first sight"" was just another name for being creepy. But right now? In that moment? God. I can't even describe it.

I was telling myself about how ""You can't feel that way!"" ""You don't even know her!"" ""Stop being creepy!""

But what I was feeling at that moment wasn't Lust. I had no ill intention in me. All I wanted to do at that moment was talk to her. Take her out to coffee. Hold her hand. SOMETHING.

My family eventually decided to keep moving, and that was the last time I saw her. I've been thinking about that ever since it happened, wishing we could had crossed paths under more solid circumstances.

**Durable construction:** A good 6-cup coffee pot should be built to last, with high-quality materials that can withstand daily use. Look for models with stainless steel components, durable glass carafes, and robust plastic housings.

**Pause-and-Serve Feature:** For those impatient mornings,the pause-and-serve feature allows you to pour a cup of coffee mid-brew without making a mess. this cleverly designed mechanism temporarily stops the brewing process when the carafe is removed, preventing drips onto the hot plate.

This feature typically involves a one-way valve that seals the brewing chamber when the carafe is lifted. The pause duration is enough to pour a cup, avoiding the mess associated with impatient pouring. This feature is a practical convenience for busy coffee lovers.

Crack! 

My fiancé hit me.

Three minutes ago, I had been daydreaming about how to decorate our ridiculously expensive penthouse apartment, where every corner looked like it belonged on the cover of a magazine.

Two minutes ago, I accidentally broke a mug.

Then, Rhys slapped me across the face-hard.

My cheek burned like it had been seared by fire.

It took a full thirty seconds before my brain restarted, slowly piecing reality back together.

""Are you f**king insane?"" I gritted my teeth, forcing the words through the cracks of my jaw.

Rhys's lips were pressed into a cold, tight line, his expression dark and resolute. 

""It was just a mug with Catherine's face on it,"" he said, as if my reaction was an overblown performance, not the result of something horrifying he had just done.

""You have got to be f**king kidding me."" I stared at him in disbelief, my ch**t heaving as rage and humiliation churned violently inside me, ready to explode.

For half a second-just half-something like guilt flickered across his face. Then it vanished, consumed by a storm of fury.

""No, you're the insane one!"" he roared. ""I already agreed to marry you-what more do you want? Catherine's gone, but you still broke that mug on purpose!""

His voice trembled with anger. ""She was your sister! She had to leave because of you! And now you're jealous of her? You won't rest until every trace of her is erased, will you?""

The hatred in his eyes cut deeper than the s**p.

My cheek throbbed. My hand was still bl**ding. But nothing hurt more than my heart.

I forced myself to unclench my jaw and made one last attempt to explain. ""It wasn't me. I never asked her to leave.""

Technically speaking, I understood why someone might say that. Catherine had left behind a letter. 

In it, she said she'd seen my diary, realized I had a crush on Rhys, and decided to ""let go,"" to ""let him be yours.""

I don't think she ever understood that a diary meant privacy. I never meant for anyone to read it, but not only did she read it-she told everyone.

No one cared about the pain I felt when my secret was exposed. I was dragged out, nailed to a pillar of shame, forced to pay for her so-called noble sacrifice.

To my family, it was like I'd been bumped up to the starting lineup out of nowhere, replacing the golden girl-I should've been grateful. 

Even if Rhys had st**bed me in the gut, they'd still find a way to excuse it.

It was as if my parents had always hated me. No matter how much better I did than Catherine, they always saw me as bitter, as someone who couldn't protect her fragile pride.

The searing pain on my cheek intensified.

My fingers clenched tightly around the engagement ring. A wave of heat-anger, humiliation, resentment-rose in my throat.

Hot tears welled in my eyes, blurring my vision. I blinked fast, wiping them away before they could fall.

I would not cry. I would never show weakness in front of him.

I took a heavy step toward the door, struggling to move. I had to get out of there, or I would completely fall apart. 

Whatever shred of dignity I had left-I couldn't let it be destroyed in front of this man.

Rhys suddenly grabbed my wrist and yanked me back. ""Clean it up.""

I looked up at him in disbelief, needing to confirm I'd heard him right.

""You broke the mug. You clean up the pieces."" His voice was icy, absolute.

He had to be insane.

""No."" I lifted my chin and spat the word without an ounce of compromise.

His face tightened, jaw clenched. ""You sure you want to do this?""

""Yes. I said no."" My eyes were red, but they blazed with defiance as I stared him down without flinching.

If love meant I had to grind my self-respect into the dirt, then it was worthless to me.

The air between us was taut enough to snap. I could almost hear it crackling. The fury in his eyes was an uncontrollable blaze, threatening to consume me. 

And beneath that fire, I saw something else-disbelief. The once docile little lamb had bared her fangs.

He took a step closer, menace radiating from him. ""Last chance. If you don't obey me, then we-""

""-are over,"" I finished for him, cold and final.

Shock froze his face. For a moment, the air went still. He hadn't expected me to actually say it.

While he was caught in that moment of confusion, I wrenched my arm free from his grip. 

The taste of freedom hadn't yet bloomed in my ch**t when he snapped back to life, grabbing my arm again with brutal force.

Now.

I spun around without hesitation and raised my hand-sm**k! A resounding s**p landed hard across Rhys's handsome, arrogant face.

The air froze again, thick with silence.

My palm tingled slightly, but it brought a rush of fierce, unprecedented satisfaction.

Rhys staggered back a few steps, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief-not from the pain, but from a world turned upside down.

He never thought I would dare. After all, I had once loved him so deeply.

I lowered my hand, lifted my chin, and looked calmly at his stunned expression. I gave him a faint smile. ""Now we're even.""

Without waiting another moment, I dragged my feet away from that suffocating h**l.

If I stayed even one more second, I would break down. I'd rather choke on my own tears than let him see them fall.

Then-thud-I fell.

High heels and emotional chaos are a terrible match.

Pain shot through my palms and knees as they scraped against the hard marble. Bl**d surged out instantly, but I barely felt it.

I got up, grabbed my purse, and kept walking.

Home. I just wanted to go home. Away from all of this. Away from him.

Like a woman fleeing the scene of a crime, I burst out of the building-only to slam into a wall of mu**le and the in**xicating scent of expensive cologne.

I looked up-and saw sharp, sculpted features with an aura so commanding it could silence a room. 

He looked like the kind of man who, if you pissed him off, wouldn't just ruin your life-he'd erase your entire existence.

Unfortunately, that only made him more attractive.

For a second, I wished he would throw me over his shoulder and carry me to his lair-my face flushed red instantly. 

I snapped myself back to reality.

""Sorry,"" I mumbled and rushed into the elevator of my apartment building.

Back upstairs, I rummaged through my bag. My heart sank.

No keys.

Of course. The universe had clearly declared today The End of Mira Day.

Frustration and helplessness surged in my ch**t. I kicked off my heels and shook the doorknob violently. It didn't help-but I needed to let it out. 

Why did everyone always choose Catherine?! Hadn't I done enough?

I collapsed against the wall, sliding down to the cold floor as sobs tore from my throat. The tears came in a flood, impossible to stop.

Just as I was nearly choking on my own cries, a voice-low, smooth, like black velvet-cut through the air behind me.

""Your key.""

Fury sparked in my veins. Why did someone always interrupt me just when I was about to get it all out?

Annoyed, I turned, ready to glare-only to freeze.

Through tear-blurred eyes, I saw him again. The man I had bumped into downstairs-the one who looked like he had stepped out of a Renaissance painting.

""Your key fell,"" he said, raising an eyebrow as his gaze landed on the scattered contents of my purse. ""That's probably why you couldn't find it.""

I stared at the key resting in his elegant hand, my face flushing so hot it could've lit a match.

I snatched it from him and fumbled to unlock the door, stumbling inside without a word.

It wasn't until my back hit the door that I realized-I hadn't even thanked him.

Great job, Mira. You absolute id**t.

Hesitating, I crept toward the peephole. Through that tiny lens, I saw him calmly turn, unlock the door directly across the hall, and stroll inside.

He lived across from me?

He must have just moved in. With a face like that-and that aura-there's no way I wouldn't have noticed before.

Wait, Mira. What are you doing? You're seriously letting a hot new neighbor make you forget the h**l Rhys just put you through?

No. Absolutely not. All men are tr**h. Always.

I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to steady my racing heartbeat, reminding myself not to be so st**id again. 

But no matter how hard I tried, that sculpted face kept flashing through my mind.

I needed ice-for my racing pulse, and more urgently, for the stinging pain on my cheek.

Just as I forced myself up to head to the kitchen, my phone rang, shrill and sharp.

One glance at the screen made my whole body go cold.

Mom.

I couldn't ignore the call. If I did, she would destroy my career without hesitation. She was absolutely capable of it.

The moment I picked up, her voice sliced through the air-cold and merciless.

""Mira, you must be insane! How dare you do something so disgraceful to Rhys! You apologize to him right now, or you're no longer our daughter!""

I opened my mouth to explain, stunned-but she hung up before I could get a single word out.

I gripped my phone tightly. Why was it that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn't earn even a sliver of their love? 

And Catherine-she never had to do anything, yet she was their perfect, precious jewel.

Enough.

I thought if I worked hard enough, my family, my fiancé-they would love me.

But that's never going to happen.

I have to reclaim the self-respect I lost long ago.

I have to break off this engagement with Rhys-no matter the consequences.


Chapter 2 Plan B
For the next forty-eight hours, I became one with my bed.

No calls. No outside world. Just me, a pile of blankets, and the crushing weight of humiliation.

That s**p from Rhys wasn't just a blow to the face. In so many ways, it was a s**p across my entire life-one steeped in desperation, delusion, and pathetic longing. 

It forced me awake. It made me look back on everything I'd ever done to make him notice me, everything I'd done for a fantasy called ""us"" that had never truly existed.

God, where do I even begin?

Like the time he casually mentioned he liked girls with smooth, silky hair. That night, I ordered three bottles of the shampoo he'd once praised. 

My scalp broke out in hives. I smiled through the pain and said, ""It's fine-some allergic reactions are worth it.""

Or when he told me he was too busy with work to grab dinner, so I stayed up learning how to bake and brought him a box of pastries in the rain. 

He didn't even open the door-just had the receptionist tell me, ""Don't bother next time. I don't like sweets.""

Then there was that night at his friend's dinner party. I forced down oysters-my most hated food-just to seem ""graceful and agreeable."" 

I spent the entire night crouched over a toilet, writhing in pain until 3 a.m. He didn't ask if I was okay. He laughed and said, ""Can't even handle seafood? That's just dramatic.""

But the worst?

That time he quoted a line from The Godfather he liked. I stayed up all night reading film essays just to casually drop the quote at a party.

I got it wrong. He corrected me in front of everyone, sneering, ""Don't pretend to like things you clearly don't understand.""

And I laughed. I laughed and said, ""You've got such a good memory.""

What a joke. I never realized I was never the person he wanted.

He never really saw me. To him, I was nothing more than a low-rent version of the ""perfect and untouchable"" Catherine. A cheap stand-in.

I wasn't her, but I could offer him the faint illusion of having her again. That was all I was good for.

I buried my face in the pillow and laughed until I shook. Not because it was funny-but because the pain had gone too deep for tears.

Thankfully, after my parents delivered their final ultimatum two days ago, they hadn't contacted me again.

A small part of me wondered-did Rhys intervene? Did he finally realize what he'd done?

Suddenly, the doorbell rang.

And it didn't stop ringing.

For a full five minutes.

I gr**ned into my pillow. Oh god. Social interaction.

Dragging my exhausted body to the door, I opened it.

Yvaine Carlisle-my best friend and the only person who had the legal right to yell at me-stood on the other side, hands on hips. Then her eyes landed on my face.

Her expression froze. The light in her eyes dimmed. ""What the h**l happened to you?""

""I'm fine,"" I said, trying to sound casual. She wasn't buying it.

She reached out, gently tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. Her jaw clenched.

Then-silence.

Not the awkward kind. The dangerous kind. The kind that comes right before something explodes.

""Who hit you?""

""Come inside,"" I muttered quickly, trying not to draw the neighbors' attention. That would be mortifying.

Yvaine didn't move. She gripped my arm and spoke through gritted teeth. ""Mira. Who. Hit. You?""

As soon as the door clicked shut, I collapsed into her arms. My face buried in her sweater, and within seconds, the fabric was soaked.

She didn't flinch. She just held me, her hand moving in calm, soothing circles across my back.

I didn't know how long I cried. Long enough for my throat to burn and my nose to turn bright red like Rudolph. Eventually, I managed to force out a single word.

""Rhys.""

Yvaine didn't move.

Everyone in Skyline City knew that name. Rhys Granger wasn't the kind of man who needed to throw punches to destroy someone.

One phone call to the right person, and your life would be over. Reputation, money, status-he had it all.

Every move he made was deliberate, timed to perfection-like the ticking of a Rolex. 

When he chose to go to war, he was a nobleman wielding cruelty like fine art, probably with a glass of aged Sc**ch in hand.

People called him arrogant. No one ever called him vi**ent.

That's why, when Yvaine processed what I'd just said, I could practically hear the gears in her brain screaming in protest.

""No way,"" she muttered under her breath, as if denying it out loud might somehow make it untrue. ""Rhys? Your Rhys? He couldn't have...""

I got it. I really did. Rhys was supposed to be the gentleman. The golden boy. The flawless, elegant, untouchable good guy.

""It was him,"" I said quietly.

She exhaled sharply, then started rubbing my back again, this time slower. ""Tell me what happened.""

I swallowed. ""I was at his place. I, uh... accidentally broke a mug.""

Her entire body tensed. ""Just a mug?""

I nodded.

Silence. Then she clenched her jaw and said, ""I swear to God, if you tell me it was some priceless, hand-crafted, one-of-a-kind family heirloom-""

""It was Catherine's mug.""

Yvaine's hand froze mid-pat.

Everything shifted. One second, she was my concerned best friend. The next, she was a woman plotting mu**er.

I grabbed her wrist before she could get ahold of something worse. ""It's over between Rhys and me.""

""Really?""

""Really. Even if the earth split in two and Skyline City sank into the ocean, I wouldn't marry him.""

That stopped her from storming out to commit ho**cide.

""Catherine. That venomous snake-"" Yvaine spat the name like it physically hurt her. 

""She's not even here anymore and she's still managing to wreck your life! And your parents? They just stand there watching! I swear, they could watch her light your house on fire and they'd hand her the matches. It's unbelievable!""

I felt like a balloon someone had just popped-deflated, exhausted. That all-too-familiar ache settled deep in my ch**t.

I knew some parents would always love their firstborn more. And there was nothing I could do about it.

""I'm sorry, Mira.""

Yvaine sat down beside me and gave my head a firm push toward her shoulder. I pulled away and managed a weak smile. 

""Actually, I think it's a good thing. At least I found out what kind of man he is before we got married. Better now than after the vows, right?""

She let out a long sigh, her eyes softening. ""Mira, you know no matter what happens, I've got your back.""

Right then, my stomach growled loud enough to interrupt the moment. Loudly.

Like a magician, Yvaine reached behind her and pulled out a takeout bag, giving me a look that practically screamed: I knew you'd be like this.

I wanted to hug her, but I was too busy eating like a ravenous little goblin.

After dinner, she pushed me into the bedroom and went off to clean up. I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling, drained and overwhelmed. What now?

Through the half-open door, I heard her on the phone. I didn't catch every word, but the ones I did hear... were iconic.

""A pile of s**t.""

""Total f**king psycho.""

""Oh, you think that's bad? Wait till I tell you what this vi**ent ba**ard actually did-""

She was probably talking to Zane Hasterton. And unlike Rhys, Zane would never raise a hand to her.

The way Yvaine so instantly, so fiercely chose me-without hesitation, without question-made my throat tighten. She believed me. No one else did. But she did.

This wasn't something she did lightly. Rhys's family sat at the very top of the food chain-untouchable. And I had no doubt her parents wouldn't be thrilled to see her go up against them.

I curled deeper under the blanket and let out a slow breath.

Why couldn't my parents love me like that?

Ever since their favorite daughter Houdini'd her way out of their master plan, I became Plan B. But that didn't mean they forgave my existence.

Let's be honest: the only reason they'd stopped actively berating me was because I got engaged to Rhys. 

That little arrangement somehow elevated me from ""irreparable family di**race"" to ""potential saving grace.""

Part of the reason I agreed to the engagement-and I know how pathetic this sounds-was because I thought maybe I could finally get something Catherine had: a sliver of parental affection. 

A crumb of approval.

But now that the engagement was off?

I was disposable again.

Last I heard, they were boxing up my things, ready to ship me off to some remote jungle where I'd spend the rest of my life befriending anacondas and repenting for my sins.

They were absolutely capable of that.

I gr**ned into my pillow. What the h**l do I do now?

Unless... I married someone more powerful than Rhys.

The idea was so ridiculous I snorted. Right. Because billionaires are just wandering around Skyline City hoping to marry a 23-year-old orphan with no patience for their bullshit.

And yet-

A face flashed in my mind.

Three days ago. My new neighbor.

I remembered, quite inappropriately, thinking I wouldn't mind being alone with him in his apartment where he could do all sorts of rated-R things to me.

I shook my head, quickly banishing the thought. I didn't even know his name. Just that he had the kind of aura that could slice a person in half.

No. Way too dangerous.

I gr**ned again.

If I hadn't broken that st**id mug, everything might've been okay.

But it wasn't. And it's not. And there's no going back.

F**k! Why am I the one trying to fix this when I wasn't even the one who messed it up?! I sat up-and bam, the door burst open.

Yvaine marched in. ""Sl**p is just going to make you feel worse. We're getting up, and we're going to find a d**k worth loving-one that's better than Rhys's.""

WHAT?!

While I gaped, she had already changed me into a new outfit.

Just like that, we were off to Skyline City's most exclusive club-members only.


Chapter 3 Rebound Night
""Is this really necessary?"" I stood at the end of the line, shivering, tugging desperately at the hem of my tragically short skirt. 

I could practically feel it-if I opened my mouth to speak, my un**rwear would be on full display.

""Sweetheart, we paid a fortune to get into this place. Of course we're going all in. Do you not get it?"" 

Yvaine declared like a mafia queen, standing tall against the icy wind in her five-inch heels without the slightest trace of fear.

""But isn't this a little too-"" I didn't even get to finish before a brutal gust of wind slapped me across the face like it had a personal vendetta. 

I immediately zipped up my puffer jacket and curled into myself like a frozen shrimp.

Yvaine let out a dramatic gr**an. ""Mira, come on. We're going to a b*r, not an Arctic expedition.""

""I'm just glad I won't be hospitalized for hypothermia tonight, thanks,"" I snapped back.

She rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might fall out, gave me a once-over full of disappointment-but said nothing more. Small victory. My puffer jacket was safe-for now.

I'd thought we'd have to wait in line like everyone else. That was the whole reason I wore this thermal fortress of a coat. But clearly, I had underestimated Yvaine.

She had zero plans to follow the rules.

With the ease of someone who'd done this a thousand times, she slipped a rolled-up bill into the bouncer's hand, her palm casually grazing his rock-hard ch**t like a Bond girl who'd forgotten her martini.

Ten seconds. That's all it took. We were in.

Yvaine was the kind of beautiful that made men forget protocol-and ethics-in an instant.

And just like that, we breezed into Roxanne.

The place was thick with heat, perfume, and the effervescent scent of ch**pagne. 

I ripped off my coat the second we stepped inside, only to be met with an are-you-trying-to-embarrass-me glare from Yvaine.

She handed her coat off to a passing server with a flick of her fingers, like she'd personally hired the man. Regal, effortless, born for this.

I tried to copy her moves. Failed miserably. Nearly dropped my purse and stumbled like a hamster who'd just woken up from a freezer nap.

Graceful? No. I looked like roadkill in Gucci heels.

If I hadn't known each co**tail here cost about the same as my checking account balance, I might've even convinced myself I was pulling it off.

""Jesus Christ!"" I gasped, eyes glued to the menu like it had just in**lted my entire bloodline.

Yvaine gave me a sideways glance and scoffed. ""Relax. Tonight's on me.""

I exhaled with something dangerously close to gratitude.

Considering I'd nearly broken off an engagement, risked being exiled to some remote tropical island by my parents, and needed to budget for anti-snake spray, I needed all the charity I could get.

Price tags aside, the view was elite: ambitious young actors, outrageously good-looking models, and a legion of finance bros who looked like they gave TED talks while wearing Burberry.

It was a glittering buffet of vanity and hormones, wrapped in velvet lighting and the illusion of power.

We found a table near the b*r and hadn't even ordered drinks when a bartender locked eyes on us.

Well. He was hard to miss-tall, sculpted features, sleeves rolled to the elbows just enough to show off well-trained forearms.

He shouldn't be mixing drinks-he should be in the Louvre. Or at the very least starring in Dior's newest fragrance campaign. 

Maybe that's why this club was so expensive: even the staff had to be perfect.

""Two 75s, French br**dy,"" Before I could even locate the cheapest drink on the menu, Yvaine had already tossed her order at the ba**ender. ""Make it strong.""

And of course, she didn't forget to flash her signature smile-the one that balanced perfectly between s**y and innocent, chin tilted just enough to say ""Oops, didn't mean to flirt.""

The ba**ender reached effortlessly for the g*n, giving her a half-smile. ""Rough night?""

""More like an engagement-level disaster,"" she said, casually pointing her thumb at me. ""And it's wrapping up real soon.""

I glanced at her. ""Thrilled that my personal life is now public broadcast.""

She patted my hand with mock sympathy. ""Sweetie, this place runs on romantic catastrophes. Without bad decisions, no one would be buying drinks.""

Then she turned away and melted into the crowd, flipping into Social Queen Mode like someone had hit a switch.

In under ten seconds, she completed a visual sweep-like a hawk zeroing in on prey-before spinning back around and pointing her perfectly manicured finger toward the edge of the dance floor.

""Okay, listen. You need a rebound. Exhibit A: Six-foot-two, hair neater than your ex-fiancé's moral compass, shirt unbuttoned just enough to scream s**y without slipping into cheap. He either owns a yacht or, at the very least, a VIP card.""

I shook my head. ""Nope.""

Her eyes flicked to a new direction. ""Exhibit B: struggling musician. Dressed like payday hasn't happened yet, but he's hot enough you'd forgive him. You'd fund his next album and still sl**p like a baby.""

""Pass.""

She sighed, then pointed again. ""Fine. Exhibit C: total dad vibes-but the good kind. Like 'books your doctor's appointment and your breakfast' dad, not 'calls the waitress 'sweetheart' and thinks climate change is a myth' dad.""

I gr**ned into my hands. ""Yvaine, please.""

She didn't back down. ""Mira, you cannot sit here like a decorative wall gecko. Tonight is about rebooting your life, not stitching up emotional wounds.""

Just as she geared up for a fourth round of rebound recommendations, she suddenly froze. It was like someone had hit mute on her entire system.

Then, far too casually, she said, ""Hey, want to hit the bathroom?""

I narrowed my eyes. ""No?""

""...Or maybe let's move tables? The vibe here's weird."" Her smile was tight, and her voice cracked like a pair of worn-out heels.

Weird vibe? We'd only been sitting for ten minutes, and we just ordered drinks. By Yvaine's standards, we hadn't even made it past the opening credits.

Then I followed her gaze.

A half-private booth.

Rhys.

He had his arm draped around a woman. Her head rested on his shoulder, makeup flawless, smile polished and effortless.

I didn't need more details.

That face-I would never forget it.

Four years ago, a girl vanished under mysterious circumstances. 

I, in all my na?ve glory, believed she had simply ""stepped aside,"" choosing to selflessly walk away from a future with Rhys.

And now, here was Catherine-perched on my ex-fiancé's lap, locked in a pose so in**mate.

I had told myself I was over it. Over him. We'd broken up. It was done. Time to move on.

Until I heard what came next.

""Honestly, I didn't think she'd fall apart over a coffee mug.""

Catherine's voice was soft, full of false pity-the kind that sounded like she'd just k**led someone and was now gently tucking a blanket over the body.

She gently swirled the w**e in her glass, her lips curling into a near-perfect smile. 

""Of course I put that mug somewhere obvious. I wanted her to notice. After all, she still doesn't know you've been seeing me behind her back. It was time she caught a little hint, wasn't it?""

She looked up at Rhys, eyes glowing with admiration. 

""Honestly though, darling, your performance was spot-on. Even I almost believed you were worried she'd find out about us, instead of just helping me pull off the scene.""

""She's so st**id-of course she thought you were upset about the mug, not terrified of exposing your af**ir.""

Rhys chuckled softly, smug and relaxed. ""I had to act like I cared. She spends every day trying to be the perfect girlfriend. If she found out all her effort still couldn't compete with you, she'd lose it.""

Catherine laughed under her breath and patted his ch**t.

""Don't worry. Knowing Mira, she's probably still scrambling to fix things. She's the type who always believes that if she just tries hard enough, people will finally see her worth.""

Her laugh turned soft, laced with pity so sharp it felt like a bl**e.

""But the harder she tries, the more pathetic she looks. And me? I just 'happened' to return home. Her parents don't know a thing. They didn't even get the chance to stop me. Tomorrow, I'll be seeing them in broad daylight-because she gave up the engagement herself, and you, dear, are blameless.""

Catherine leaned back with a triumphant sigh. ""Isn't this the best ending? I never gave up on you. I was just waiting for her to step aside.""

Rhys nodded slowly, a small smirk on his lips. ""You're right. You always are.""

A loud roar rang in my ears, and my heartbeat pounded against my skull like a war drum.

Yvaine must've been saying something-pleading with me to stay calm, not to do anything st**id-but I didn't hear a word.

I wasn't the same Mira who swallowed her pride for praise anymore.

I slipped free from Yvaine's grip and turned to the bartender. ""Your best red. Put it on Rhys Granger's tab.""

The ba**ender-bless his beautiful, rule-breaking soul-didn't even flinch. He handed me the bottle like I'd just ordered mineral water.

With the bottle in hand, I had a mission. A singular, burning purpose.

The bouncer moved to stop me, but one look at my face-like a vengeful goddess straight from h**l-made him wisely back off, hands raised in surrender.

I marched straight toward Rhys and Catherine. They were lip-locked in some dramatic, second-rate soap opera make-out scene.

I raised the bottle-and smashed it, with all my strength.

Glass shattered with a sharp crack, spraying across the table. Rhys's forehead split instantly, a trail of bl**d beginning to drip down between his brows.

Catherine screamed and leapt off his lap. ""Mirabelle?! Are you insane?! What are you doing here?!""

She scrambled to find a lie, panic rising in her voice. ""You're misunderstanding, it's not what you think-""

Rhys cut her off, his hand gripping her arm, his gaze dark and cold. ""Don't bother explaining, Catherine. It doesn't matter. My parents will take your side, no matter what. We're just correcting an old mistake.""

Catherine's panic twisted into smugness in an instant. She curled into his side with sickening sweetness and cooed, ""Oh, honey, your head's bl**ding. We have to get to the hospital.""

Before I could say anything, Yvaine rushed to my side, fury radiating from every pore. 

She raised her hand, ready to s**p Catherine straight back to whatever pit she'd crawled out of. ""You disgusting, two-faced bi**h-!""

I grabbed her wrist, steady and cold. ""Yvaine, let them go. If they stay here one more second, I might lose my appetite permanently.""

I locked eyes with Catherine's smug little face and raised my voice deliberately. ""After all, the theme of this place is premium taste, not some clearance aisle for secondhand tr**h.""

Catherine's smile froze on her lips. Rhys's face darkened, but they had no chance to respond.

Yvaine, emboldened, lifted her chin and sneered at the bouncers. ""Well? What are you waiting for? Kindly es**rt these two walking health code violations off the premises.""


Chapter 4 Key Guy
As soon as they were gone, Yvaine dragged me out of the club.

D**n it. I hated that Catherine had predicted every single thought running through my mind.

Yes, I was still considering salvaging my relationship with Rhys.

But now? The truth was right there, unmistakable and r*w-they'd been sl**ping together behind my back all along. 

And me? I was just the fo**ish, unnecessary third wheel in their twisted little story.

What I couldn't figure out was-why had Catherine faked her disappearance four years ago? What exactly had she been hiding? And why come back now?

My eyes stung. I tilted my head toward the sky, forcing the tears back.

Fine. Catherine's back. Perfect. Now they could all reunite like a happy little four-piece family?, and I... I was finally free.

""Mira... I'm so sorry. I had no idea they'd be there tonight. I didn't even know Catherine was back."" Yvaine's eyes were full of regret.

I gave a bitter laugh and shook my head. ""Neither did I. But I heard it loud and clear-they've been screwing around for a while. To them, I was just in the way.""

""Those godd**n as**oles!"" Yvaine hissed through clenched teeth. 

""You should tell your parents. Let them know Catherine's not the perfect angel they think she is. What about Rhys's parents? No way they'll tolerate a scandal like this.

I was quiet for a moment. Yvaine had a point-Rhys's parents were the only people who had supported me. 

But he was their son. They wouldn't choose me over him. Not in the end.

And my parents? I let out a breath, heavy and tired. ""You know better than anyone-they only care about Catherine. No matter what I do, I'll never replace her.""

Yvaine grabbed my shoulders, worry darkening her gaze. ""So what now? You're just going to let them humiliate you?""

""Maybe."" My voice dropped to a whisper, a weariness weighing it down. ""Maybe if I accept it, it'll finally be over.""

Suddenly, Yvaine's phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen, her brows knitting in frustration. 

""Mira, my agent just called. There's a last-minute ad shoot-I have to go now. Can you get home on your own?""

I nodded, managing a faint smile. ""Go. Don't worry about me. I'll call when I get back.""

After she left, I hailed a cab. Instinctively, I gave the driver my home address. But barely two minutes into the ride, a wave of suffocating pressure settled over me.

""No, wait,"" I said quickly. ""Take me to a b*r. Any bar. Just... far away from Roxanne.""

The driver didn't blink-clearly used to the erratic demands of Skyline City's broken-hearted.

We eventually pulled up outside some unfamiliar ni**tclub. Velvet ropes. A crowd of influencer-types wielding selfie sticks. 

I didn't bother checking the name. I handed the bouncer some bills and strode inside.

Straight to the b*r.

""Wh**key sour. Large. Keep them coming.""

""Ma'am, maybe you should slow down,"" the ba**ender said gently, concern in his voice.

I slammed my empty glass on the counter and shoved my card across. ""Did I stutter? Top me off.""

The ba**ender sighed but obliged.

""That guy's right,"" a smooth, magnetic voice murmured beside me.

""Too much al**hol can impair cognitive function and judgment. Unless you want to wake up in a stranger's b*d tonight-""

I turned, irritated-then froze.

It was him.

The man from last night. My new neighbor. The one who'd handed me my keys with all the casual elegance of a Renaissance statue.

""Well, well. You again."" I raised an eyebrow, a teasing smile tugging at my lips. ""You really can't resist other people's business, huh?""

He chuckled softly, completely unfazed. ""Think of it as a well-developed instinct for being helpful.""

I gave an exaggerated sigh. ""You're a hero, truly. But I don't need saving, Mr. Key Man.""

""I know,"" he said calmly, lifting his glass and taking a slow sip. His eyes were clear and sharp. ""But you do seem in desperate need of clarity.""

I frowned. ""Is this how you treat all your neighbors? First their keys, then their dignity?""

He laughed-a low, rich sound. ""Only when the neighbor looks like she's on the verge of self-destruction.""

""...But I am always self-destructing,"" I muttered, suddenly quieter. ""Doesn't it seem kind of pathetic? Like my whole life is just one mess after another?""

He didn't laugh. He didn't rush to reassure me, either. He didn't even deny what I'd just said.

He just looked at me. Calm. Quiet. Like he was watching a slow-motion disaster unfold-but had no intention of stopping it.

""You're not wrong,"" he finally said, his voice low and steady. 

""You are pretty good at making a mess of things. Like right now-you can't even stand properly and you're still demanding more al**hol.""

I froze, frowning instinctively.

But he went on, his tone unhurried-like he was flipping through a book and had landed on a sentence he already knew by heart:

""But strangely, you always seem to meet someone who refuses to walk away... right before everything falls apart.""

I stared at him, half in shock, half in suspicion. ""Are you... fl**ting with me?""

He gave me a slow smile, his eyes lazily curving with just the right amount of mischief. 

His voice came out smooth and provocative, like velvet wrapped around steel. ""Does it make you feel any better?""

His voice was low and warm, like wh**key being poured into a glass at midnight-just a little dizzying, just a little dangerous. 

He looked at me with an intensity that felt nearly uncontrollable, like he might lean in close and whisper things in the dark, on a b*d, asking if his to**h was hard enough.

My heart skipped a beat. My cheeks flushed instantly. My fingertips tightened against the edge of the b*r.

I had to look at him properly. Really see him.

That face-it wasn't just handsome. It had the kind of quiet, devastating maturity that no amount of cologne and hair gel could fake. 

Not the kind you'd find among the over-groomed boys who danced to house music like they were owed the world.

A wild, uninvited thought flashed through my mind.

If I let him walk away tonight, maybe I was rejecting one of those rare, merciful moments when fate offered a second chance.

Before I could stop myself, my hand wrapped around the sleeve of his suit jacket. I rose from the barstool, heart pounding.

""So, Mr. Keys,"" I said, my voice hoarse but firm, ""since you're so committed to helping... why not help all the way?""

He clearly hadn't expected that. His brow lifted slightly, surprise flickering across his face-but he didn't step back. 

He didn't laugh. He simply said, calm and steady: ""Of course. As long as this is something you won't deny when you're sober.""

""I'm sure."" I answered without hesitation.

Gripping his wrist tighter, I pulled him through the crowd and out of the b*r.

The night wind struck us like a cleansing slap, city lights flickering above.

I didn't let myself pause. No time to think, no space for regret.

We crossed the street. Entered the nearest ho**l lobby.

Because tonight, I needed to know if I had the courage to accept what fate had placed in front of me.

It must have been one h**l of a night, because when I woke up, sunlight was spilling through the curtains, and the red LED numbers of the digital clock blinked 10:07 AM at me with the judgmental smugness of a nun catching you sneaking out of the church.

The sh**ts still carried his scent-bergamot and sin-and my body buzzed from the lingering aftershocks of what we'd done.

I stared at the ceiling and thought: That was absolutely phenomenal s*x.

I ached everywhere-in the best, most regrettable way.

But my head... my head was a battlefield. It felt like a hundred tiny jackhammers were drilling through my skull.

The al**hol from last night had declared mutiny, and my brain was paying the price, like someone had jammed a red-hot poker through my temple.

I had no idea how much I drank-definitely more than I should've.

The details had vanished into a fog thicker than a London morning.

Gr**ning, I rolled out of bed. Gr**ned again. Began gathering the scattered pieces of my clothing.

The plan was simple: Get dressed. Sneak out. Pretend this never happened.

I had just picked up my skirt when a voice stopped me.

""Leaving so soon?""

S**it.

I turned-very slowly, thanks to the hangover and the shame-and saw him standing in the bathroom doorway, a towel slung low on his h**s.

I stared. Unashamed.

Images from the night before surged back into my brain. I suddenly felt... very, very thirsty.

""We need to talk,"" he said.

Chapter 1
After the SATs, Remy casually mentioned he'd bombed his score and suggested we apply to a smaller college in Chicago together. I fibbed to my parents, claiming I’d messed up my college preferences. But at the party, he had his arm draped around the prom queen and dropped the bombshell.
'Alessandra and I both got into the University of Virginia in Charlottesville—it’s the only prestigious university there,' he announced.
Someone piped up, 'What about Luisa?'
Remy shot me a teasing grin. 'Luisa, I was just kidding. You didn’t take it seriously, did you? If you want to go to the same school, just retake the exams. You’re the academic star, after all.'
Later, when I skipped the summer prep class, he seemed uneasy. 'Luisa, you’re not into going to the same school as me anymore?'
---
The day I got my acceptance letter, Remy called me out of the blue.
'You’re coming to the dinner tonight, right? I’ve got a surprise for you. You’ll be there?'
A warm flutter filled my chest. 'Yeah, should we go together?'
I couldn’t help but hope he’d finally confess. Everyone had always assumed we’d end up together. We’d been childhood friends, after all, and for three years, we’d worked tirelessly to get into the same school. It felt like the whole world was rooting for us.
Dinner was set for 7 p.m., but I was at the meeting spot by 6:40. I watched the clock nervously until 7:20 rolled around. Then, Remy’s voice echoed outside the private dining room.
I stood up instinctively, only to freeze when he walked in, hand in hand with Alessandra. My thigh hit the chair, my body stiffened, but no one seemed to notice. At the door, Remy laughed, carefree and bright. 'Sorry for being late, had to give someone a ride.'
A few suggestive chuckles rippled through the room, while others glanced at me curiously. He carried on, unfazed, his arm still around Alessandra. 'Perfect, everyone’s here. I’ve got an announcement.'
'Alessandra and I both got into the University of Virginia.'
My heart felt like it was being crushed, the ache making it hard to breathe. I tried to steady myself amidst the cheers, but the room’s energy was overwhelming.
'Never thought you’d make it to UVA!' someone exclaimed. 'You always seemed so laid-back.'
'Yeah,' another chimed in. 'We thought you were either sleeping or playing basketball. But you did it—chasing love all the way to success.'
Remy scratched the back of his head, sheepish. 'Alessandra said she likes guys with good grades, so I had to step up to win her over.'
A friend near me leaned in. 'What about Luisa? Weren’t you two planning to go to the same school?'
Remy glanced at me, his smirk playful, his eyes glinting with mischief. 'Luisa, I was just messing around. You didn’t take it seriously, did you? If you want to go to the same school, just retake the exams. You’re the top student, after all.'
I swallowed the bitterness rising in my throat, sipped some sparkling water, and forced a smile. 'I didn’t.'
I wanted to say I hadn’t taken it seriously, but my voice betrayed me. I drained the rest of the water, trying not to look pathetic.
My ears felt muffled, like I was underwater. Someone muttered uncomfortably, 'That’s a rough joke. What if she took it seriously?'
Remy waved it off, his usual laid-back self. 'We’ve known each other forever. She’ll be fine. Besides, I believe in Luisa. You’ll nail a retake, won’t you?' He winked at me.
My breathing grew heavy, his figure blurring in my vision. For the rest of the karaoke session, I made an excuse to leave.
But Remy cornered me at the hotel entrance.
He called my name repeatedly, but I ignored him until he stepped in front of me. 'Luisa, what’s up tonight? You didn’t even respond to Alessandra. I specifically ordered cheese puffs for you, and you didn’t touch them.'
I wanted to scream, to demand why he’d made such a cruel joke, if he had any idea I’d taken it seriously. If he knew… how much I liked him.
But the way he looked at me tonight, with Alessandra by his side, shattered my resolve. We were just neighbors, childhood friends. He’d never promised anything; it was my mistake to read too much into his casual words.
It was always one-sided.
I looked down, avoiding his gaze. 'I don’t feel well.'
Remy chuckled. 'Are you upset about the school? Or are you really not feeling well?'
I stayed silent.
He sighed. 'But you can’t ignore Alessandra. She kept telling me she’s worried you don’t like her, and now she’s upset because you wouldn’t talk to her.'
I looked up at him, my voice sharp. 'So what? Do I not have the right to feel unwell? Must I engage with her?'
His brows furrowed, his expression softening after a moment. He grinned, pointing at me. 'Oh, I get it. You really applied to a school in Chicago, didn’t you?'
I stayed silent. Our bond, forged since we were kids, made him read me like an open book.
His laughter grew. 'I knew you’d stick with me. Can’t believe you bought it. Why not retake and join us in Virginia as our junior? You definitely can do it. You scored high enough for Chicago’s top schools; a retake won’t be a problem.'
I fought back tears. 'Go comfort Alessandra. I’m heading home.'

Chapter 2
Remy was insistent, pulling me back. ""Luisa, just go have a quick word with Alessandra, then you can leave.""
I tried to shake him off a couple of times but was pulled back into the private room.
""Alessandra, I brought Luisa back. She wasn't feeling well earlier and wants to apologize.""
Alessandra smiled with a slightly flushed face. ""It's alright, Luisa. If you're not feeling well, you should rest.""
Remy gave my shoulder a gentle nudge, leaning in to whisper urgently, ""Come on, say something.""
My thoughts were a tangled mess, and his insistent prodding only irritated me more. I pinched him sharply to get free, then turned and walked out.
""Luisa!"" Remy called after me.
With a hint of tears in her voice, Alessandra asked, ""Remy, does Luisa dislike me?""
It seemed like Remy said something to comfort her, then he caught up with me and grabbed my arm again, sounding a bit frustrated, ""Luisa, Alessandra finally agreed to be with me. Why are you being like this?""
He frowned, looking upset. ""Come back and apologize to Alessandra.""
""It's just a university admission, is it worth all this fuss?""
I stopped and looked at him. He hesitated, and I asked, ""If I apologize, will you let me go?""
He didn't respond, so I went over to Alessandra, gave a slight nod, and said, ""I wasn't feeling well tonight and missed what you said. I'm sorry. Congratulations to you both. Goodbye.""
Returning to Remy, I asked without expression, ""Are we done here?""
His demeanor softened a bit, as if realizing something was off, and he spoke gently, ""Can I take you home? I'll have someone keep Alessandra company. You seem...""
""No need,"" I interrupted.
Suddenly, the whole situation seemed less dire.
At least the university agreed to waive all tuition fees and offered me a $10,000 scholarship annually.
This lesson is one I won't forget.

Chapter 3
When I arrived home, my parents immediately informed me that Remy had secured admission to a prestigious college in Seattle. They were astonished, remarking that they never imagined the rebellious boy would achieve something so impressive.
Honestly, I hadn’t anticipated it either. I thought he would end up in a lesser-known school, so I dedicated a lot of time to exploring better universities near those locales. But because he expressed his desire for me to be there with him, I adjusted my plans accordingly. I practically became his tutor during our senior year of high school. I knew his academic standing well, so his scores didn’t surprise me.
What I didn't realize was that he had understated his score by 90 points and even lied about the city.
I straightforwardly told my parents about the university I'd been accepted to. Initially, they were shocked but pretended to be pleased, though they couldn’t entirely mask their disappointment and sadness.
""It’s okay, Luisa is smart. Why not redo the year? It's just one more year, and we're confident in you,"" they advised.
I shook my head. ""No need. I’ll apply to grad school and return then.""
Just a couple of years delay. It’s not like I won’t have another chance, and I’m confident I can achieve it.
I forced a slightly wry smile. If they knew it was my own rashness that led to this result, they’d probably be quite angry with me.
When they saw me crying, they assumed I regretted it and started reassuring me, saying it was fine not to go and that I could immediately start preparing to redo the year.
I wiped my tears away and said resolutely, ""I won’t retake the year. I’ll manage on my own, trust me.""
The next morning, Remy’s parents came over to thank me. They were all smiles and kept showering me with praise when they saw me. Particularly Remy's mom, ""Oh, Luisa, you're incredible, helping Remy get into such a top-notch college.""
I forced a smile and gently withdrew my hand.
Remy raised an eyebrow at me, ""My mom wanted to visit you yesterday to express her gratitude, but I said you went to bed early.""
Cheyenne hesitated before finally asking, ""Luisa, I heard from your mom that you filled out the wrong application. Are you considering redoing the year?""
""Remy mentioned he tried to talk you into it. With your scores, attending such a school seems beneath you.""
My mom’s smile faded, and the warmth from earlier vanished. ""Cheyenne, she’s already distressed. There's no need to bring this up.""
My body tensed, and my fingers clenched subconsciously. ""It’s fine, Mom. It’s my own problem.""
It's my foolishness.
Remy frowned at my words.
When our parents settled down with their coffee, he pulled me aside. ""So you’re planning to head to New York and not redo the year?""
I nodded. ""Yes.""
""Why? Are you truly willing to leave me behind?""
I glanced at him and noticed he seemed uneasy. What was he worried about? Did he think I should always be by his side?
Looking him squarely in the eye, I said, ""Weren’t you the one who encouraged me to go?""
Remy appeared taken aback and averted his gaze. ""You should redo the year. With your grades, the top college in Seattle is within reach.""
""I’ll wait for you in Seattle. This time it was my fault. If you're ever with Alessandra, I’ll even order more of your favorite foods.""
I almost laughed at his words and gave him a pointed look before turning to leave.
""Oh, and regarding Alessandra, please don’t mention it to my parents. Her folks aren’t keen on her dating in college, and my parents always think you and I will eventually end up together. If something happens, she’ll be upset.""
""I don't have that much free time.""
I left him with that remark and walked away. In slightly over a month, I’d be heading to New York, and the time I had left to spend with my parents was quickly ticking away.

The first thing we discussed is the general vibe we want, so we can budget accordingly. Only problem is that we want completely different things, because, you know… opposites attract lol

She wants a beach wedding, it’s her lifelong dream. She wants seashell decor, lots of white, bridesmaids in blue, etc. I want a fall wedding, and I’ve always wanted to get married in a beautiful library. We can’t seem to compromise on this. I think I’m more willing to compromise, because in the bottom of my heart I know that a fall wedding isn’t really practical with the weather in my area. Think, sub tropical with reverse Canadian weather (unbearably hot for a good chunk of the year. Similar to southwestern US, but humid). 

Knowing all of this, I still would want some ideas in which I could incorporate my fall wedding ideas into the beach wedding without it looking disjointed.

If it helps, we both agree on a few things like how we would like a color scheme similar to the lesbian flag (we’re not fully set on it though), a chai cake as a wedding cake (our first date was a coffee date and I made her try chai! It’s now her favourite drink), and the type of ceremony we would like to have.

Even at 24g I will have enough room for an old school, thick, puck screen.   My daily regular is their Ethiopa Kercha; I only need about 23g. But that's still more than 10% above what I would expect from the basket label. 

Does anyone have any explanation into this phenomenon? Is anyone else experiencing it? Does your 20g basket seem full at 19? Or do you need to get up to 23, 24g to not have excessive headspace. Is it just my choice of beans?

1mrnv2m,https://i.redd.it/l50aei3j0cjf1.png,Finance Is Going Autonomous and I am Excited About It,"For decades, finance has been a slow-moving relay race. Procurement hands off to legal, legal to finance, finance to accounts payable—one step finishes before the next begins. It made sense when humans did all the work.

👉 But the rules are changing.

🔹 2025 marks the tipping point.

AI agents are no longer experiments—they’re in production, handling the grunt work: approving low-risk expenses, coding transactions, flagging outliers, and even updating policies on the fly. Once you’ve experienced an agent that rebooks your hotel when prices drop, you can’t imagine going back to email chains and manual approvals.

🔹 By 2026, the busywork is gone.

A $5 coffee shouldn’t trigger three approvals, fourteen minutes of collective time, and $20 in overhead. Automated finance agents can collapse that to seconds, slashing manual reviews by the majority and catching issues before humans ever see them.

🔹 By 2027, finance runs in parallel.

No more sequential bottlenecks. AI copilots in procurement, legal, risk, and finance review the same request at once, pre-negotiating, pre-approving, and reconciling in real time. Decisions that once took weeks happen in minutes.

🔹 By 2028, autonomy is here.

Expense agents clear 99% of transactions without a human touch. Treasury agents move idle cash into yield instantly. FP\\&A agents run live forecasts and scenario planning. Humans shift from clerks to strategists, guiding and governing fleets of specialized agents.

This isn’t about replacing people—it’s about redeploying them to the work only humans can do: judgment, creativity, and strategy.

Autonomous finance isn’t a future concept. It’s a present shift. The question is: will you adapt while the change is gradual, or only once it’s sudden?

1mrnurn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FloridaPanthers/comments/1mrnurn/question_about_panthers_plus_and_my_viewing/,Question about Panthers Plus and my viewing options.,"Hi, I have a question about my viewing options for Panthers games. I work nights and don’t have the opportunity to watch many Panthers games live on TV. I don’t have cable and don’t want it. I used NHL TV and ESPN Plus for years and the 48 hour blackout wasn’t a big problem because for years the team didn’t matter and no one talked about them, so I could live on my own little 48 hour delayed hockey world. Obviously, as the team has gotten extremely better it’s become much harder to live in that 48 hour delay without knowing results I truly enjoy watching the games after work with a couple beers or in the morning with a couple cups of coffee, but that’s becoming extremely difficult as my coworkers want to talk about games and results immediately the next day. So my question is what are my options to not have to wait 48 hours to watch a game, while I can’t watch it live? Does Panthers Plus have the games recorded after the fact, or is it only live broadcasts? I don’t want cable, it’s to expensive for how little I will use it. Just please let me know. Thank you in advance

Almost There, By Clayton Gunner

Book overview
""Almost There"" follows Ethan, a man caught in the grinding cycle of modern poverty, where every dollar has a job before it’s earned, and every small joy feels like a risk. Across twenty-nine vivid, self-contained chapters, we follow him through a year of survival—stretching groceries, juggling three jobs, selling prized possessions, and navigating a parade of unexpected expenses.

Told with empathy, grit, and moments of quiet humor, this isn’t just a story about financial hardship—it’s about resilience. It’s about the small victories that keep you going: a clean bank balance, a hot cup of coffee without guilt, a shared laugh in the middle of chaos. Readers will see the weight of scarcity, but also the light that breaks through: kindness from strangers, the warmth of family, the hope of “almost there.”

For anyone who’s ever tried to balance a budget with too little to go around, or dreamed of a life where breathing doesn’t cost extra, Ethan’s journey will feel both painfully familiar and deeply inspiring.",1,1755328341.0,booksuggestions,0,1.0,False

Think: virtual coffee shop + barkadahan + co-working tambayan ☕



It’s super casual, and you don’t need to be active all the time — kahit lurker ka lang, okay lang. We’ve got channels for:

✨ Coworking (voice channels where tahimik lang habang nagtatrabaho)

💬 Chika about remote life, hobbies, tools, and random kwentos

🎮 Shared interests like games, books, playlists, and productivity hacks

🌱 Community without pressure. No spam, no drama, just chill



Right now, I’m just inviting people slowly para intimate and safe yung space.

If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, let me know or **comment “Interested”** and I’ll share more info and see if it’s a good fit for you 💌

I often spend time at my Dads place (like several times a month) and he almost never has visitors and when he does it’s family or the few close friends he has. Yesterday morning my Dad went to get coffee before coming back and working from home and while he was gone a woman knocked on the door. Again this is super weird I’m at my dad’s place a lot and he does not get visitors and he does not go out much. Well this women around my Dads age was at the door and said she knew my dad from college and wanted to come in and surprise him. I told her I didn’t know who she was and she was not coming in. I said I would call my dad and let him know she was here. I asked for her number to call her after I notified my dad and maybe they could meet later. She said no she would just wait outside the door but asked me not to tell my dad she was here because she wanted it to be a surprise? So I shut the door and called my dad.  He didn’t know who she was when I described her but when I told him her name was P he said he thought he knows who she was. He said he knew her in college (my dad only went to his freshman year of college before dropping out) but had not talked to her since until last year. Apparently she had lost her husband 3 years ago and she had found my dad’s number and had texted him. My dad said they talked very infrequently no more than like twice a month, although she tried to reach out more, but my dad was going through several health issues and told her he wasn’t available and was just focusing on himself. The beginning of this year she told him she wanted to start a relationship and my dad told her no and that he only saw her as a friend. When she kept trying to reach out he blocked her, they have not spoken since until she showed up at his apartment. Apparently she traveled all this way from several states over with the hopes of starting a relationship with my dad. He has told her no but she insists on meeting again before she leaves town. My dad feels guilty and feels like he has to see her again. And as horrible as I know this sounds I know he is meeting her again because she is in a wheel chair. He says he will see her again tomorrow and make it clear he is not interested but I do not want him to see this woman ever again because this whole situation is creepy!

1mrnls4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/1mrnls4/built_a_little_app_to_actually_track_tethered/,Built a little app to actually track tethered swims — would love your thoughts,"Hey all,
I’m Patrick, a DIY Ironman finisher (https://www.patrickbiggin.com/blog/iron-resolve-the-road-to-a-self-made-ironman), long-distance runner, and occasional triathlete. When I’m not finding increasingly daft ways to test my endurance, I help people with tech and AI. This project though? Purely for fun (read: fuelled by stubbornness and coffee).

For months I’d been using my Apple watch in my 10ft Steelmax pool with a “creative” workaround: set the pool length to 200m and do a fake “turn” every 5 minutes to trick it into logging distance. It kind of worked… until the watch started ignoring my turns altogether. At that point I was basically swimming blind and just accepting whatever poultry number the app decided I swam that morning.

I'd already scoured the app store for actual apps for this and couldn't find anything so I built one.

It uses your actual stroke count and an estimated meters-per-stroke baseline (calculated from your real pool swims) to give a much closer guess of your distance, pace, and SWOLF. It also syncs with Strava if you want your friends to know you were definitely not just standing in your garage for 45 minutes.

I’m hoping it might be useful or at least interesting to others here. It’s just me building this, so if you spot something I’ve missed, think the calculations are off, or have ideas for making it better, I’d love to hear it. I had to tweak the sensitivity a bit as it wasn’t registering all my breaststroke strokes, happy to hear if its too much, etc.

If nothing else, maybe we can trade “weird swim hacks that stopped working” stories.

He doesn't want to touch any of us, because he's afraid of getting sued for sexual harassment. I think its the same for the editor who's a guy, so he's got a problem with men too. He's always been easy to talk to and easy going, online, and he's very complimentary about my art style, he fan-girls over it like a 15 yr old meeting an idol. 

Recently, I was in the area he lives in and asked to meet in person. He agreed, and was estatic to have a chance to meet me in person. We agreed to meet at starbucks, and when I got there, I saw him sitting at a table, playing a game on his phone. I walked up to him, he stood up and waved ""hi"", but I wanted more of a business greeting, so I held out my hand, and the dude literally froze! He wasn't moving so I grabbed his hand and pulled it to mine for a shake. Its not that hard, it doesn't have to be a thing...

But you know what, I thought it was kind of funny, so after we had coffee, I asked him if he wanted to hang with me and a friend I was staying with. I said we could swim or play games or something. He was all for it. So I texted her, let her know the plan, and told her about this prank I wanted to do with her on him. She LOVES reactions, and his are some of the best!

He can't drive due to some traumatic thing that happened to him as a kid, wouldn't say, so I took him in my rental to her place. First, we wanted to get her to shake him hand, then have her trip and stumble into him, my hopes were rewarded, because his hand ended up on her breast. She freaked out on him and threatened to call the police or to sue him, and called him a spineless pervert. 

Dude didn't get mad, but he looked like he was going to cry. He's a white dude, ain't no black dude acting like that! He is spineless! LOL He apologized a few times, and she forgave him. So we went inside and listened to music talked a bit. My friend wanted another go at him, so I sat next to him and she sat on the other side of him and we'd pass things to each other, occasionally rubbing against him, he tried to leave, but we over powered him. A normal black man, would love it, but his shrimpy dumb white gay ass was just being a prude.

Middle of the afternoon, he tells me he needs to go and was going to get an uber, so while he waited we wanted one final prank. Her bf was with his boys, but they were coming back and I got behind him and shoved and little while she was in front talking to him, and finally I got a shot of him holding her and it look sensual. I sent it to her bf, and he just got back to get in my boss's face. Dude didn't know what to do, and got himself backed into a corner. After Bill got in his face a little and shoved him, we told both of them it was just a prank, but I was a little, cause Bill punched him. Eh, boys will be boys right?

I haven't heard anything from him in a while and I know it was a little mean spirited, but cmon he's a man, and he was acting like a child. He almost cried, no normal guy would do that. I dun no why white gay guys are such babies. It could have gone differently if he acted like a fucking adult.

I tried to send him a I'm sorry graphic, but he's just not answering me at all.

Did I go to far? Am I the asshole here? Cause I don't really think so. He's a man, and acted like a cry baby over a few little harmless pranks. Like they say, ""its just a prank, bro"" Relax!",0,1755327409.0,AITAH,17,0.25,False

Chapter 1

The day Jared Hurlow's first love, Siena Lisburn, returned to the country, I decided to leave him.
In the three years of our marriage, he never stopped thinking about Siena—and I was exhausted, emotionally and mentally.
For the last three days, I'd stopped arguing with him.
I watched as he rented out an entire revolving restaurant to celebrate Siena's birthday and fasten around her neck the necklace I had designed.
Later, I destroyed Siena's engagement party.
Meeting Jared's furious gaze, I smiled. ""Congratulations, Jared.
""This is my gift to you two. Do you like it?""
***
Standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, I couldn't help but think about the phone call with my mom just a few minutes earlier.
She had seen the news and called me about Jared and Siena.
Jared still wasn't home.
Or maybe, he never planned to come home tonight.
On the front page, a photo of him and Siena walking side by side out of the airport glared back at me.
The headline read, ""Hurlow Group's CEO Welcomes First Love Siena Home in Person.""
Ten years ago, he was caught in a nightmare—his family went bankrupt, and his parents betrayed him.
I was there for him, fighting our way up from nothing.
I gave everything I had to pull him back from the brink.
I stayed by his side as he rebuilt his business empire.
I remember the night of his celebration party, when his eyes were fixed only on me.
That was when I fell for him.
I thought I'd made the right decision.
But reality hit me hard on our third wedding anniversary.
That was the first time Jared murmured Siena's name in a drunken haze.
His first love from youth drove a wedge between us.
Jared began staying out constantly.
There were unexplained property records under his name and encrypted, yet clearly suggestive, messages on his phone.
Each one stabbed at my heart like a sharp blade.
""I confronted him and fought with him, completely losing control.""
All I earned was his growing impatience and indifference.
""Amelia Kirwell, you've changed,"" he'd said, looking at me like I was a stranger.
He said I wasn't gentle or understanding anymore—that I'd become irritating.
I simply replied, ""The 72-hour countdown starts now.""
My voice trembled and cracked, but it was heavy with relief.

Chapter 2

The final three days.
I drifted through them like a soulless spectator.
Jared rented out the city's largest revolving restaurant to celebrate Siena's return.
Her massive portraits flashed across the giant LED screens.
Reporters swarmed the place, headlines screaming, ""Mr. Hurlow Spares No Expense for His Muse.""
I sat at home, quietly sorting through what was left of my life.
Clothes. Design sketches.
In the wedding photo on the wall, Jared had his arm around my waist, his smile genuine.
I reached up, took the frame down, and smashed it hard against the floor.
The glass shattered—just like our marriage had, long ago.
The wedding ring—supposedly the only one he'd ever given in his life.
I tossed it carelessly into the pile of broken glass.
Jared came home once, his clothes scented with another woman's perfume.
He noticed the empty spaces in the closet and the bare walls, his brow furrowing.
""What are you doing now?""
His tone was impatient. ""Siena just got back. There are a lot of events. I have to be with her—it's for work, you should understand.""
He tossed a velvet box onto the coffee table.
""Limited edition Van Cleef & Arpels. To make it up to you.""
I opened the box. Inside was a diamond necklace worth a small fortune.
It was worlds apart from the cheap silver chain he once gave me in that basement—the one he'd saved up for six months to buy, the one warmed by his hands.
""Thank you.""
I closed the lid, my voice flat. ""It's beautiful.""
He seemed surprised by my reaction, studying me for a few seconds.
Then his annoyance only deepened.
""As long as you like it.""
He loosened his tie, turned, and disappeared into the study. He never came out.
48 hours left on the countdown.
The doorbell rang.
Standing outside was Siena.
She wore a couture dress from this season, her smile gentle, but her eyes glittered with triumph.
""Ms. Kirwell, aren't you going to invite me in?""
She let herself in without waiting for an answer.
She looked around, taking in the home that once belonged to Jared and me.
Her gaze landed on the Van Cleef & Arpels box on the coffee table.
She laughed lightly. ""Oh, Jay gave me the same one. He said it suits me better.""
She came closer. ""Ms. Kirwell, I heard you helped Jay a lot in the past. That must have been tough. But now, I will take care of him.""
Her tone was cool, a declaration that she was the real mistress of this house.
""Jay says the place is too big, too cold. Once I move in, we'll redecorate, add some warmth.""
I watched her performance with a blank expression.
""Oh, right,"" she said, as if just remembering. She pulled an invitation from her purse.
""Tomorrow's my engagement party—top floor of the Four Seasons Hotel, the one owned by the Hurlow Group.
""Jay insisted you be there to witness our happiness.""
She pressed the invitation into my hand. ""Ms. Kirwell, you'll come, won't you?""
I took the glaring invitation, my voice even. ""Sure.""
Satisfied, Siena smiled and swept out the door.

Chapter 3

The final 24 hours of the countdown.
Jared came home, his face dark and stormy. ""Siena was here, wasn't she?""
There was a note of accusation in his voice.
""Yeah.""
""She invited you to the engagement party?""
He scrutinized me, his gaze sharp as a blade.
""Yeah.""
I didn't look up, just kept packing my things.
""Amelia.""
His tone was cold and sharp.
""Tomorrow's event is important. I don't want you showing up and causing a scene, making Siena uncomfortable.""
""Uncomfortable?""
I finally looked up at him, letting out a bitter laugh. ""Jared, do you really think I'm not humiliated enough already?""
His eyes flickered, but impatience quickly took over. ""Let the past stay in the past. Siena and I are serious.
""If you just behave, you'll keep your place as Mrs. Hurlow. You'll get everything you deserve.""
""My place as Mrs. Hurlow?""
I scoffed.
""What is that, exactly? An empty title? A prop? Just a backdrop to showcase your true love with Siena? Jared, what am I to you?!""
""Amelia!"" he snapped, voice low and harsh. ""Don't be ungrateful! I can give you a life of luxury, a status everyone envies—what more do you want?
""Siena... she's different. She understands me. She needs me.""
""She needs you?""
I stared at him, my face expressionless.
""Jared, when you had nothing, when you were beaten down and abandoned, who stood by you? Who needed you then?
""It was me!
""And where was Siena? When you hit rock bottom, she turned her back and ran straight into someone else's arms!
""And now that you've made it, now she's back, and suddenly she understands you? Suddenly she needs you?!""
""Shut up!""
He raised his hand, then slammed it down on the cabinet beside him, the crash echoing through the room.
His chest heaved, his face thunderous.
""Don't you dare insult Siena! She had her reasons back then—you wouldn't understand! All you ever do is nitpick, acting like some bitter shrew!""
""Fine, I don't understand.""
The last bit of warmth in my chest vanished for good.
I nodded, refusing to look at him again.
""Don't worry. I'll be there. After all, as Mrs. Hurlow, I have to keep up appearances, don't I?""
He eyed me suspiciously, then let out a cold snort and slammed the door on his way out.

Chapter 4

Top floor of the Four Seasons Hotel.
Siena was breathtaking in a custom-made wedding gown, her beauty almost unreal.
She clung to Jared's arm, her smile radiant as she basked in everyone's well wishes.
Jared wore a perfectly tailored black suit, tall and striking.
The way he looked at Siena—with that deep focus and tenderness—was once so familiar to me.
Now, that gaze was a dagger, stabbing straight into my numb heart.
I wore a simple slip dress, my face bare, utterly out of place in this glittering celebration.
Holding a glass of champagne, I stood in the farthest, darkest corner.
The emcee's voice rang out across the hall, ""Distinguished guests, let us witness together the engagement of Mr. Jared Hurlow and Ms. Siena Lisburn...""
Jared and Siena exchanged a smile so sweet it seemed to overflow from the giant screens.
""Mr. Hurlow, do you—""
A sudden surge of jealousy flared in my chest. Without thinking, I swung my arm and sent the towering champagne display crashing down!
Crash!
The shattering sound echoed through the entire ballroom.
Crystal flutes toppled and exploded, champagne cascading everywhere.
A torrent of wine splashed squarely onto Siena's priceless white dress, crimson liquid spreading like wildfire across the delicate fabric.
Siena's scream pierced the silence.
The room froze.
Every eye—shocked, appalled, judgmental, some even gloating—
All fixed on me.
The tenderness on Jared's face vanished in an instant, replaced by fury and disbelief.
He whipped his head around, his glare like a blade, zeroing in on me in the shadows.
He shoved Siena aside and stormed over, his anger radiating off him as he seized my wrist in a bruising grip.
""Amelia!""
He growled, ""Have you lost your mind? You just had to make a scene, humiliate us in front of everyone?!""
Pain shot through my arm, but I only frowned slightly.
Staring into his handsome face, twisted now with rage, I let a slow smile curve my lips.
Not in anger, not in sorrow, but in utter release.
I rose up on my toes, ignoring the suffocating tension rolling off him, and leaned close to his flushed ear.
My breath was warm against his skin; my voice was soft, eerily calm.
""Congratulations, Jared,"" I whispered.
""You finally get to marry your first love.""
I swept my gaze across the silent, stunned crowd, then back to his furious eyes.
""This is my wedding gift to you...
""Do you like it?""
Jared's pupils constricted, his grip on my wrist tightening painfully.
His lips parted, as if to roar something at me.
But in that instant—
""Countdown complete.
""Return protocol initiated.""
A cold, mechanical voice echoed in my mind—right on cue.
And as Jared stared at me as if he'd seen a ghost, my body began to dissolve, breaking apart into a thousand tiny, shimmering blue lights.
Like fireflies on a summer night, the lights slipped through his grasp and drifted upward, free at last.
My smile froze on my lips as I gazed into the void.
""I'm going home. Goodbye... forever.""
The rage on Jared's face shattered, replaced by pure terror and confusion.
He instinctively reached out, grabbing at the scattered lights.
But his hands closed on nothing but empty air.
""Amelia?!""
His voice cracked in panic, raw and desperate.
A second later—
The lights vanished completely, dissolving into the domed ceiling of the grand ballroom.
Gone like mist, without a trace.
All that remained was the stunned silence and the mess on the floor. And Jared stood frozen in place, hand outstretched, eyes hollow and empty.",2,1755327196.0,Novelnews,6,1.0,False
1mrnh0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/metro/comments/1mrnh0a/just_finished_the_game_trilogy_here_is_what_i/,Just finished the game trilogy. Here is what I think:,"Overall, really good. My favorite is probably last light because it has a defined villain for the story, and the story itself is really good.

If i were to rank them from best to worst (not necessarily worst, just weakest) i would say last light, exodus, 2033. Let me explain.

What i like about last light are the characters and story, i liked the addition of Anna, though her and artyom's romance is VERY rushed. The 4th(?) time you see interact with her (mind you they are still basically strangers), they are fucking in front of everyone in the quarantine. That is the really only gripe I have with the story, everything else is amazing. Pavel was a well done twist, and general korbut was a very well written villain. The final mission where you defend D6 was really fun (I got the destroy ending). The child dark one was a very interesting character inclusion because he gives you perspective into who the dark ones were and how they didn't mean any harm (more on that when I talk about 2033). 

Exodus was overall the best game in the trilogy, characters, gameplay, story were all very well done. BUT, it was incredibly disappointing. There are zero stakes in regards to Anna's health THROUGHOUT the game. She cannot die no matter how much time you take to save her and believe me, i took my sweet fucking time. the story doesn't allow her to die. Fake fucking tension. But you can die, and your friends. Duke survived, dimir left, Alyosha didn't get hurt and artyom survived. And getting dimir to stay with the group is incredibly annoying I hear. The story would have been elevated ten fold if Anna had to potential to die. The game cherry picks what choices matter and dont matter, and I found that to be very annoying. Other than that MASSIVE coffee stain on the story, it was fine. The overall goal to find someplace safe outside of Moscow is interesting and keeps you engaged the whole time.

Metro: 2033 was an amazing start to what would become the metro trilogy. I like how the dark ones are a very nuanced villain. And you can straight up find out they mean you no harm. The quest to find D6 was fun, fighting through the different political ideologies was interesting. I dont have very much to say about 2033 other than it was a good start to an amazing series.

One thing I think was a really bad decision was artyom being a silent protagonist. It didn't take too much away from the story, but it could have added so much more. Characters interact with artyom in a way where there needs to be a verbal answer from him, but there just isn't. I found it a bit funny in exodus where Miller (rip) brings attention to that with his line ""your silence is starting to make me mad"" or something like that. In the books artyom wasn't silent, so I dont understand why he was made silent in a game with a preset story. Baldur's gate 3 did a really good silent protagonist because it was an RPG with dialog options that you yourself could say out loud and envision yourself in that roll. But not metro. It was a very clunky story element that didn't make any sense. I also dont like how khan just doesn't exist in exodus. No mention of him. What happened? Artyom and Miller survived D6 (canonically) so what happened to khan? 

Well, I have to get into the shower now but this was a very good trilogy to play through and I'll pick it back up when im done with my 8372nd mass effect play through. Cheers!",6,1755327180.0,metro,0,1.0,False
1mrngiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Europetravel/comments/1mrngiw/trip_report_upper_middle_rhine_valley_moselle/,"Trip report: Upper Middle Rhine Valley & Moselle Valley based in Boppard, May 2025 (Solo, Public Transport)","Hello! I was in Boppard in early May 2025 (solo, fully by public transport) for 5 days, very early in the season and would like to share my trip for those who are planning to go to the Upper Middle Rhine Valley and the Moselle Valley!

**Traveller type/goal for this trip:** relax and chill, admire nice scenery on hikes, old town walks, some castles (I dont have to visit all).

**Base:** Boppard. It was in the middle of the places I wanted to go to, and it was eligible for the free [VRM region](https://www.vrminfo.de/fileadmin/data_vrminfo/PDF/Gaesteticket/Infoflyer/Flyer_GT_englisch_01.pdf) train ticket. I stayed at **Hotel garni Günther**, a balcony room with lovely views of the river. The room was a little dated but has all the essentials and was clean. Many evenings were spent chilling at the riverside and then walking 30 seconds back to the hotel where I chilled even more at the balcony till sunset. Note that you can hear the trains running at the opposite bank even at night, though it was not a big deal for me once I fell asleep.

**Meals**: Most lunches are nameless because I ate at random places that were open (too early in the season!) I ate all my dinners in Boppard. Not a lot of options.

* **Restaurant Keltenschmaus** was a popular steak restaurant, it was great but not spectacular. Had to make reservations (online).
* **Severus Stube** is another popular one serving local food that locals go to! I also made reservations (just walked in to reserve for the next night). Yummy.
* **Osteria In Piazza** \- I ate here twice just because I love Italian food haha.

**Mode of transport between towns:** Mainly train. I took the ferry to Koblenz because the Stolzenfels Castle was closed when I was there so I had some spare time. I used the DB app for train and bus connections.

**Top sites and general thoughts:** I think 3 days to capture the essence would be enough! Suggested days, ranked in order:

* 1 full day in **Bacharach** with hiking. If you are doing a day trip from Frankfurt/Bingen/Rudesheim and can only go to one town, it should be Bacharach!! Very beautiful town, and the views from the hike was spectacular.
* 1 day in the Moselle Valley region: **Burg Eltz and Cochem**. Burg Eltz (Moselle Valley): The hike/walk there was wonderful like all the reviews said. The castle and the English tour was really great! Cochem was a nice big old town that still retains its charm.
* 1 day for Stolzenfels Castle (though I didnt go!), Koblenz and **Braubach + Marksburg Castle**. Braubach & Marksburg Castle: The town was really quaint, and the English tour at Marksburg Castle was wonderful. It's a smaller castle than Burg Eltz which gave a more ""homely"" vibe :)

**Full Itinerary:**

* Day 1 (Sat): Boppard
   * Arrived in **Boppard** from Frankfurt, checked in hotel
   * Hiked to Boppard viewpoint (Vierseenblick) and took the **chairlift** down. The hike was strenous and steep for the first part, and I took lots of break. The view from Vierseenblick was ok, not very spectacular. But it was nice to just chill and watch people paraglide and fly the small planes.
   * Dinner in Boppard.
* Day 2 (Sun): Koblenz + Braubach (can go #3)
   * Original plan in the morning was: bus to Stolzenfels Castle but it was closed for maintenance (usually open on Thursday-Sunday).
   * Took the **KD ferry to Koblenz** instead (dock was right in front of the hotel!). It was a relaxing 2hour-ish (if I recall correctly) ride, very chill. You can order drinks and snacks on board, I didnt know so I already had coffee and pastry from a cafe before boarding, but got an apple strudel on board just to chill.
   * **Koblenz**: Spent the early afternoon there, walked from the dock to the older part. It is easily walkable and not much was open on Sunday. Had lunch at a random place, nothing amazing as it was the few that was open. I didnt visit the fortress but I saw many people at the cable car station area.
   * Took the train to reach **Braubach**. Wandered around the old town, very lovely and quaint, and it seems like I was the only tourist there. Made my way to the Rose Garden. Then, I hiked the Castle trail to **Marksburg Castle**, was too early for the 4pm English tour but they only had English tours at 1 and 4pm so I wanted to make sure I can make it on time! Loved the tour and the homely castle! Trail to Marksburg and back down is well marked.
   * Unfortunately I cannot remember how I got back to Boppard. I might have taken a train up to Koblenz then bus back down to Boppard, as Braubach was on the other side of the river. All covered by the VRM ticket.
   * Dinner in Boppard.
* Day 3 (Mon): Bacharach (must go! #1)
   * Took the train to **Bacharach** (note this is not in the VRM region so you have to purchase a ticket). I am not sure if it was the right way to do but I only purchased the ticket for the Oberwesel (last ""free"" station) to Bacharach and back
   * Wandered around the old town, loved the painter's corner **Malerwinkel** the most! Hiked to Burg Stahleck but note that it is a hotel/hostel now and there is no tour. Had lunch at a random place, nothing amazing as it was the few that was open.
   * Hiking highlight ([see route here](https://www.komoot.com/tour/2237717739)): Hiked up to the **Postenturm Bacharach**, continued through the Vineyards, open fields, then forest. The first part was steep but it was flat afterwards. Loved the view from the top, much more spectacular than the one from Boppard, and then the open fields were just so soothing. I didnt like the forest part as much so should have gone right where there were more fields as compared the the left, but it was still great overall! Komoot was great for planning hikes in Germany and you can see the topography to plan your hike based on your preference. The trails are wellmarked with different signs (chicken, goat, castle etc) for the different trails. I only saw maybe 1 other person walking and 1 person on a bike.
   * Dinner in Boppard.
* Day 4 (Tue): St Goar + Oberwsel (can be skipped if not enough time)
   * Train to **St Goar**, walked to **Rheinfels Castle**. Short hike was lovely. Unfortunately there was restoration going on so half of the place was covered in scaffolding. I can imagine how it looks and feels without the scaffolding, as it is more ""ruins"" type, would be lovely to visit once restoration is complete! They also have a small museum that was fun to read through.
   * Lunch was at this local place **Restaurant ""zur Krone""** \- loved the vibe, ran by an old couple and had schnitzel. It is the only lunch place that I can remember the name because it was the nicest :)
   * Had coffee at the old town strip.
   * Train to **Oberwesel**, did the city wall from one end to another. Then did a hike but gave up after half an hour as it was pretty much forested most of the way (but may open up to lovely views if I had persevered, but I was not in the mood. Ran for the train but missed by 1 minute (it was leaving but from the opposite platform that I had to go down and up the stairs for). So I just sat at the station for 1 hour lol.
   * All train rides covered by the VRM ticket.
   * Dinner at Boppard.
* Day 5 (Wed): Moselle Valley (must go! #2)
   * Took the train to Koblenz, changed train to Hatzenport (both covered by VRM ticket), then bus 365 to Burg Eltz. I dont think I paid for the bus, the driver might have waived it for me or it was covered by VRM ticket...
   * Hiked up to **Burg Eltz**, just follow the signs. I think I didnt even start my Komoot hike because it was well marked, but this was my [saved route](https://www.komoot.com/tour/2242247389).
   * When you buy the tickets, they will inform you where to queue for the English tour. Note that they only take 30 pax per tour as the rooms are small, so just stand in line when you reach! I went in the low season and many of us were sitting around until the guide came and we started to queue to get in, and thankfully I was the last few to be admitted! Lovely English tour.
   * Hiked back down, ran for the bus. You can get the bus timings on the DB app so just check it.
   * Took the train to **Cochem** (still covered by VRM ticket). I just walked around the town, it is the biggest old town I have been to so far, it's lovely to just walk around the alleys and streets, have afternoon tea etc. I hiked up to the viewpoint but didnt go to Reichsburg Cochem Castle as I've had my share of castles. Crossed the Skegerak bridge for nice views of Cochem and the hills.
   * Took train back to Koblenz then Boppard if I recall correctly.
* Day 6: Depart Boppard :)

Then we switch over to Mom and Pop Shop Collectibles fro a 'Combo' all games event. That's from 6pm until 10pm.  We've had an amazing week. Every venue was popping !!! Let's keep it going..

So far the weekend is off to a great start. A young member Cal came with his grandfather. I gave him a lesson. He's going to continue with his grandson. Then a big group of his family members showed up to eat, while he played chess. We had A LOT of kids Blitz Joe's. 

Then we had adults start coming in  Roman and Christian came from Jersey City. It was Christian's first time. He can play. Roman is an OG member.  

Then new member Aaron showed up. It was his second time. He also attended our event at Bruno's on Wednesday.  

Then we had random walk-in players Rachel, and her father Daniel.  The recently moved to Englewood from California. They're huge tournament tested chess players.  They were looking for a chess club to play in. Could only find the Jersey City club and ours.

They went to the Jersey City club first. It was dead. No one there. Then they came to Joe's. They're now members.  Helps that I beat the daughter in Blitz. I beat her dad with 4 seconds left on my clock. I also beat someone else with one second on the clock.  So, they know we can play.  They've played with the YouTube channel Coffee Chess...and Evergreen Chess. Now, they'll be on the east coast on the Bayonne Chess Society & Club YouTube channel. 

Finally Mynor showed up to get his games in. Overall, an excellent night at Joe's, as this fabulous week continues.  Chess is taking a foothold in Bayonne.  ",1,1755326948.0,BayonneChessSociety,0,1.0,False

My son is currently a single father (full custody) of his 4 year old son in Georgia. Child's mother and my son started having some real relationship problems during the pregnancy and after baby was born (they were fairly young and the pregnancy was accidental. Initially we had BM living at the house owned by my FIL because we were trying to help and support them however we could. (She stayed 2 years; 9 months while pregnant and about 1.4 years after baby was born).

At first, my son tried to get a really good job to support his gf and child but that wound up ending because of all the drama from baby mama (BM) who started off as a good/attentive mother but who got more and more frustrated at the situation and how being a mom was ""cramping her style when she wanted to go out and have a life"" 🙄 BM also has some emotional issues (I called manic depression and found out later I was correct.) Both were not being kind to each other whatsoever and both felt like each had the ""harder job"". Things worsened over time.

Eventually, both parents were occasionally smoking MJ on occasion (not while ""on duty"" but still, not smart.) CPS was called and they were both found after testing to have MJ in their system (& BM also had meth😳) Child was removed and placed with relatives who live nearby for a few months.

Our son IMMEDIATELY decided that would never happen again and *stopped* smoking MJ; BM decided that she wanted to party and do anything but be a mother so she slipped down a slope of harder drugs and heavy drinking with occasional almost-clean times but would slip again (heroin, Coke, meth... all bad.) I think she thought she could have fun for a while and then eventually just come back when she was ready; what wound up happening was that our son had ALL the hardest toddler years completely as a single parent 🥺

Fast forward, a court case was brought up for our son to get our grandchild/his son back. He was able to prove that he was completely clean and had undergone drug counseling. BM did not do either of those things.

Court decided to grant our son temporary custody of his son pending continued clean tests, positive home visits, etc. and our son has done it all. 

BM, however, took him to court AGAIN - and court decreed that she needed to undergo detox and hard core counseling before she could get supervised visitation because of her erratic behavior and unwillingness to get off drugs.

A few months later, after son and grandson had been doing well and passing all home inspections, BM sued again for joint custody; court denied this (though it did not re-demand she go through detox 🤬 & counseling) but said IF she could test clean (hair and urine) within 90 days that she could have supervised visitation which could eventually lead to joint custody one day with continued improvement - but, for the time being, our son has full custody.

Meanwhile, our son has a REALLY hard time being a single parent (we live 12 hours away & I'm stuck here caring for 2 elderly relatives daily. It's quite hard to get away) so after a while, he starts leaning on the maternal grandmother (BM's mom) who seems to be enthusiastic and loving (albeit a bit over-the-top when it comes to giving in to EVERY toddler's whim) For example, she feeds him basically junk food 98% of the time; one time when we were in town and stopped by to pick up the baby - now a toddler - and he was eating handfuls of M&M's and a Fruity Pebbles cereal snack bar with what he thought was ""coffee milk"" but was literally flavored coffee creamer in milk. That was what she fed him for breakfast 🤬🤬🤬 I couldn't believe it and our son was like, ""yeah, he loves to go over to her house because it's like that all the time. Then when I get him home, he doesn't want to eat ANYTHING healthy; just snacks/junk"" 😳😬 No duh!

So as time went on, the ONLY breaks he got - babysitting help - was from this other grandma who does love the baby (now a toddler) a lot... but isn't good at all about not overindulging, having rules, etc.

Our son tried to talk with her repeatedly about things and she'd always say she'd work on trying to do better - but things always went back to ""her way"". Eventually this got to be too much and when our son  expressed frustration with how hard she was making things for him because kiddo would come home jacked up on sugar, demanding junk, refusing time out, refusing healthy food and just generally misbehaving. 

To be fair, this kid is a HANDFUL *without* her making things harder; he's SO smart but also has some serious discipline issues and needs consistent parenting. He's already had SO much instability/change in his little life; taken away from mom & dad to live with cousins at age 18 mo-2yrs, kinda got used to that then went back and forth for a bit between them and dad, then with dad full time and couldn't see mom (court orders), then court said he could see mom - IF she'd do what she was ordered (but she didn't), etc.

Come to find out later that at LEAST a few times (& let's be honest: likely a lot), grandma was sneaking him to see her daughter/his momma against court orders.

That family 🤬 When mom (and even later, when grandma) got upset, they'd call and make accusations of abuse and/or neglect and CPS came out. SO MANY INVESTIGATIONS... and all but the very 1st proved to be baseless (but it looks bad to keep having to deal with that.)
Well, baby is now 4 and we have waited long enough for BM to get her act together. (I fully believe she LOVES this child - but she's unwilling to stay on mental health medications, unwilling to go to rehab/detox, unwilling to get counseling, unwilling to stay off drugs) 

I think it's time for our son and grandson to move down here. It's really far, I know - but here they'll have a support system. Here they have people who do NOT use drugs, don't even drink (not pious, just boring 😊). *We've* never had our kids taken away from us due to abuse, neglect or drugs (whereas other grandma HAS; she lost her girls for a year because she was neglecting them and using.) That family? Every one of them as far as I know has charges and/or has spent time in jail and/or has drug problems, etc. It's just horrifying how much they lie, abuse, cheat the system, etc.

I even got along with other grandma (despite being really concerned about how much she spoils him and the effects it has on his health and behavior) - but thought it best to try to stay friendly... it was fairly recently when our son told her, ""enough. You need to understand that he (kiddo) HAS to be disciplined when necessary, not allowed to do whatever he wants whenever he wants because it's turning him into a complete monster!"" It became a huge fight where grandma said, ""between the 2 of us only *I* have raised a child!"" (to which my son replied, ""yeah, and what a crackerjack job you did with her!"" 🙄and they left her house & stayed away.

Our son was so furious that he didn't speak to her for a week. Just when he was calming down and thinking maybe they could talk more rationally, there was a knock on the door; SHE had CALLED CPS on him alleging abuse and neglect 🤯🤬

CPS investigated and found no evidence but that was it - our son was DONE. He was not willing to deal with her anymore because he felt he obviously couldn't trust her in general or with the kiddo. So he continued to refuse her calls and did it all alone - no breaks. No financial support or help from BM who still was using occasionally and living in her car or on random guys' floors; she can't even be around kiddo safely.

Well, grandma took our kid to court. Again. Apparently thought she had a snowball's chance in hell to get FULL CUSTODY and went for it - only for the family court to look at her and say, ""um, we can't revoke dad's custody because you want your grandson; you can take this to a higher court and try to get mandated visitation but 🤷🏻‍♀️"" 

So at this point, we really wanted him to take kiddo (he has full custody) and get away from ""crazy town""... but he didn't get away fast enough (and I'm guessing he didn't think she'd go any further as money is not something she has a ton of - though to be fair, we have some but not endless lawyer funds either...! Already it's been $6K in fees and as of today, we just had to come up with $5K *more* because of grandma taking it to a higher freaking court.)

I don't know if our son and kiddo will ever be able to leave and move down here! They should be able to - but if the court mandates grandma gets to visit, how the hell do we navigate that? (Maybe through FaceTime??) Our son can't even work consistently because he's always ""on"" and kiddo has occupational therapy and behavioral therapy appointments during the week... Driving him to school (pre-K) is also a nightmare; the school is 35 mins away (plus waiting in long car line) which means our son is driving to or from school about 3-3.5 hours each day. Up and down a mountain. Gas money 💸💸 

I want to hire a PI to expose all the heinous stuff about this family; all the drugs, arrests, grandma getting pain meds and selling them every month, the mostly absent grandpa who has a bad meth addiction and once even left things where kiddo as a baby was in danger because there was a small fire; luckily nothing happened but what if it had???, (this grandpa has charges for exposing himself, trespassing, and drugs - he isn't even supposed to be allowed at grandma's house - but he still turns up there 😱), grandma claiming severe disability & getting $$ from SSDI but she works as a housecleaner for hire (so she double dips), her sneaking visits against court orders with kiddo and BM, her idea of healthy feeding, lack of discipline, etc... but I don't even know how to go about it (and can't imagine how much it will cost!) 

I do know that this is dragging out forever and in the meantime, there's a little kiddo confused about all the people he can see, then not see, how he has structure and rules (the way kids should; not overwhelmingly so!) at one place and then zero rules and all the junk you can eat at the other... this is really messing with him and we're seeing SUCH behavior issues. It's just awful. I heard he really misbehaved at pre-K this week 🫣

Any advice? Am I horrible for wanting to give up on that side of kiddo's family getting their acts together and acting like rational, reasonable adults who will get clean/stay clean/be responsible caretakers? Am I crazy for being so mad that we're now at $11K deep in lawyer's fees for mostly idiotic claims and cases?? Believe me, I UNDERSTAND that BM and her mom want to see this kiddo; he's **amazing** (SO much work and quite challenging - but just brilliant and clever and adorable!) But this has dragged on LONG enough and we want it to stop!!! My son wants to come down to a place where his mom, dad, sister, and other family members can support him and kiddo so that he has a village - not a circus 🎪!!

Advice? Insight? Experiences? Thank you.

For some context but not too many details because I don’t know if she’ll be on here. Even tho maybe she’ll read it and understand how she’s making me feel. I met this friend YEARS ago at the same job. Present day we do not work together anymore so we see each other when there’s free time plus she has a family and I do not. Since a few month ago when we didn’t work at the same job she would question me if we would still be friends. We still hung out and texted as friends do but she would continually ask if I’m going stay around or if we’re going to stay friends where it started to piss me off. So I would respond with telling her to stop asking me that or a thumbs down. 

Throughout the years of being friends we’ve done a lot together but she always makes it seem like I’ve done nothing with her. She’ll say things like “you never done that with me” or “you don’t go there with me.” Like I was telling her a story with another friend while we were at the mall and she mentioned I never went to the mall with her. Which isn’t true because a week or 2 before we did go to the mall and something funny happened to us. I brought that up to her but I don’t think she even responded when I said that because she was wrong.  

I feel like I’ve tried to be nothing but a supportive and a fun friend. Any time she asked me to go on a ride with her I’ve gone. I’ve gone to the emergency room when one of her kids were there, I’ve babysat every time she’s asked me, I’ve driven her places because she didn’t feel comfortable driving, I’ve brought her emergency stuff when she had a side job or to bring her a coffee because she couldn’t leave to get one, or the amount of nights I slept over to help her out, or going to every chorus concert her child has been in and most of the birthdays I’ve celebrated with them or going to the boardwalk/waterpark, or going trick or treating every Halloween together, coming over to celebrate holidays together. Not to mention normal stuff friends do together like go to the movies, go to the mall, gone on walks together, went to a concert, going shopping or out to eat, and the endless amount of times we hung out and just watched a good show or movie together, etc. 

Now with in the past 4 months I’ve had my own health issues come up that I’m dealing with and it’s made my life not as fun as used to be which comes around the same time we stopped working together. But this didn’t stop me from hanging out with her. I’ve spent so many times driving to her place to hang out even tho we don’t live close to each other. 

So last week she sent me a text saying something along the lines of “it seems like our friendship is over.” My heart just dropped and I thought like what are you talking about. So I asked her when did I ever say that and why would she think that. She said “no words are needed 🤣” So then I said to her “why would think that, I don’t understand.” She brought up how her other friend always invites her places but she wants to go out with me too. I just got so upset that I couldn’t even respond and still haven’t because I don’t know what to even say except that you’re making a mistake to think I don’t do stuff with you and you’re going to ruin a friendship. 

Now the weekend before this, Friday night I was supposed to go over there but I was just so tired and didn’t feel good I told her I thought it was best I stay home. She responded with I hope you’re not seeing your other friend. I just felt like wow no it’s okay or feel better. On Sunday there was a store she really wanted to go to and it was finally open. Even tho I still didn’t feel great I went because I felt like if I said I wasn’t feeling up for it she would claim I’m avoiding her. Then it was her child’s birthday and I asked multiple time what she was doing because to wanted to come over but when she finally answered she said “well we’re having cheesecake and I now you hate it so” that statement made me feel like she didn’t want me to come over so I gave up. A couple weeks before that it was Christmas in July and I thought it would be fun to do that. I brought over snacks, hot chocolate, cookies, soda, and popcorn to make it fun while watching a movie. Then 2 weeks before that I went with her while she ran errands. She also asked me to go with her to the movie but it was a last minute at 9:45 pm. I just knew I wasn’t going to make it through the movie but I guess she felt some kind of way, idk. 
 
All of this that has happened made me do some research deeper into friendship and had me thinking like I’m the only one putting in the effort. Most of the time I’m the one asking her do you want company, she never asks hey do you want to come over.  Or how I ask about how her new job is or how is she doing but it’s never back to me asking what I’ve been up to or how I’m doing. She’ll invite me when she doesn’t want to do something by herself. 

Do we talk everyday, no we don’t. Do we hang out every weekend, no we don’t. But how does that mean the friendship is over? I feel so confused and kind of used but mostly so hurt. ",1,1755326641.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best grape scrubs combine natural ingredients with effective exfoliation to deliver noticeable results. They also prioritize skin health and overall well-being.

**Grape Seed Extract:** Grape seed extract is a powerful antioxidant that helps to protect the skin from free radical damage, which can contribute to premature aging. It also contains compounds that can help to improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.

The inclusion of grape seed extract in grape scrubs provides an added layer of protection and rejuvenation. By neutralizing free radicals, this extract helps to maintain a youthful and healthy complexion, making it a crucial ingredient for anti-aging benefits.Many scrubs formulate grape seed extract by extracting it carefully at low temeratures to preserve the quality of the ingredient.

**Exfoliating Particles:** The best grape scrubs use gentle yet effective exfoliating particles, such as sugar, salt, or finely ground grape seeds. These particles help to remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and promote cell turnover.

The effectiveness of a grape scrub depends largely on the type and size of the exfoliating particles used. Sugar scrubs offer a gentler exfoliation, making them suitable for sensitive skin, while salt scrubs provide a more vigorous exfoliation. Finely ground grape seeds offer a natural and sustainable option that complements the grape-based formula, while other scrubs may have microplastic materials that are non-biodegradable which can harm the habitat.

**Hydrating Ingredients:** Many grape scrubs incorporate hydrating ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil, or aloe vera to replenish moisture and prevent dryness. This ensures that the skin remains soft and supple after exfoliation.

Hydration is just as important as exfoliation, which is why premier grape scrubs incorporate essential moisturizers to keep your skin hydrated. Shea butter is known for its rich emollient properties, while coconut oil provides deep hydration and a protective barrier. Aloe vera is a soothing ingredient that helps to calm inflammation and redness, leaving the skin feeling refreshed and balanced.

**Aromatic Blend:** A key component of top grape scrubs is the integration of calming and complementary aromatics. A complex aromatic blend is more than a scent; it contributes to the user's sensory experience in a manner that transforms and enriches the utility of a product.

Adding natural essential oils or fragrances deriving from fruit further enhance the sensory experience by promoting relaxation and a sense of well-being. Grapefruit, lemon, and lavender are popular choices that complement the grape scent and provide additional benefits, such as energizing or calming effects, so that users feel more refreshed. Top grade grape scrubs do not use harsh scents as they may irritate the skin, although such ingredients are more cost-effective.

Other critically important components of the best grape scrubs include:

*   Vitamin E for antioxidant protection
*   Glycerin for moisture retention
*   Plant-based oils for added nourishment
*   Essential oils for added sensory experiences

## Core Benefits

Grape scrubs offer a multitude of benefits for the skin, from exfoliation and hydration to antioxidant protection and overall rejuvenation.

**Improved Skin Texture:** The exfoliating particles in grape scrubs effectively remove dead skin cells, revealing smoother, more radiant skin underneath. Regular use can definitely help to reduce the appearance of rough patches and uneven skin tone.

By sloughing away dead skin cells, grape scrubs unveil a fresh layer of healthy skin, leading to a noticeably smoother and more refined texture. This not only improves the overall appearance of the skin but also enhances its ability to absorb other skincare products, maximizing their effectiveness. Some users have commented experiencing ""baby soft skin"" after their initial use.

**Enhanced Circulation:** The massaging action during application helps to improve blood circulation,promoting a healthy glow and stimulating collagen production. This can led to firmer, more youthful-looking skin.

Increased blood flow to the skin's surface delivers essential nutrients and oxygen, nourishing skin cells and promoting a healthy complexion. Regularly massaging grape scrubs into the skin can also help to reduce the appearance of cellulite and improve overall skin tone. Many grape scrubs go hand in hand with massage equipment such as jade rollers to magnify their core benefits.

**Antioxidant Protection:** Grape seed extract is a powerful antioxidant that helps to protect the skin from free radical damage, which can contribute to premature aging.This can help to reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots.

By neutralizing free radicals,grape seed extract helps to prevent oxidative stress,a major contributor to skin aging. This protective effect helps to maintain a youthful complexion and prevent the growth of age-related skin concerns, resulting in skin that looks young and healthy.

**Deep Cleansing:** Grape scrubs can effectively unclog pores and remove impurities, preventing breakouts and promoting clearer skin. This is especially beneficial for individuals with oily or acne-prone skin.

By removing excess oil, dirt, and debris from the pores, grape scrubs help to prevent the formation of blackheads, whiteheads, and acne. This deep cleansing action leaves the skin feeling refreshed and revitalized. Individuals with problematic skin report fewer breakouts after integrating grape scrubs into their skin routine.

## Key Features Analysis

The U Line ice maker boasts several advanced features that contribute to its superior performance and user satisfaction.

**Clear Ice Technology:** U Line's clear ice technology ensures the production of crystal-clear, virtually odorless, and tasteless ice cubes. This is achieved through a unique freezing process that removes impurities, resulting in ice that melts slower and enhances the flavor of beverages.

The clear ice technology uses a vertical evaporator that freezes water layer by layer, allowing impurities to settle out and be flushed away. This process results in ice that is significantly clearer and denser than standard ice, providing a premium ice experience. The system is designed to minimize air bubbles and mineral content, leading to exceptional ice quality.

**Digital Touchpad Control:** The digital touchpad control offers precise temperature management and allows users to easily adjust ice production settings. This intuitive interface provides real-time feedback on the unit's performance and allows for customized ice production based on specific needs.

The digital touchpad features a clear, easy-to-read display that shows the current temperature, ice production level, and any error messages. Users can adjust the ice thickness, set a timer for ice production, and even activate a cleaning cycle with just a few touches. The control panel is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring effortless operation.

**Built-In Pump:** Select U Line models feature a built-in drain pump, providing flexible installation options. This eliminates the need for a gravity drain, allowing the unit to be placed in locations where a traditional drain line is not readily available.

The built-in pump automatically removes melted ice water from the unit, ensuring continuous operation without manual draining. This feature is particularly useful in basements, home bars, or other areas where plumbing is limited. The pump is designed to be quiet and efficient, minimizing noise and energy consumption.

**Energy-Efficient Operation:** U Line ice makers are engineered for energy efficiency, minimizing power consumption without compromising ice production. These units are designed to meet or exceed industry standards for energy efficiency, helping to reduce operating costs and environmental impact.

U Line utilizes advanced insulation materials and efficient cooling systems to minimize energy waste. The units are designed to cycle on and off as needed, rather than running continuously, further reducing energy consumption. Many models are Energy Star certified, ensuring optimal energy performance.

Key features of the U Line ice maker include:
  * Clear ice technology
  * Digital touchpad control
  * Built-in pump (select models)
  * Energy-efficient operation

Hi folks — I’m a forestry engineer with 20 years under my belt. In forestry, you trip over these dusty old MapInfo files all the time. And they never use anything normal — it’s always some backyard, home-brewed CRS that makes WGS84 look like rocket science.

Custom CRS support (yes, you can hand-type that Franken-projection)

Batch conversion — because who’s got time to do 300 files one by one?

I didn’t think much of it at first. My mom was, weird. Not the fun kind of weird. The kind that makes you uneasy just by being in the room, like the floor might crack beneath you. When she was on hospice, she’d have her nurse cover every mirror. Every last one. I figured it was just her being difficult. People get strange at the end, right?

I took a couple of weeks off after she passed. I thought I’d clean the house, get it ready to sell, maybe donate some of her things. That’s when I noticed it.

Every mirror. Every shiny surface. Covered. And the canvases. Dozens of them, stacked in corners, leaning against walls, hidden behind furniture. Self-portraits. My mom. In oil, acrylic, charcoal, pastels. Some finished. Some, paused mid-stroke, as if they were waiting for answers.

I tried peeling one cloth back, just a sliver, to see. The instant I did, the air thickened, heavy, sluggish. Her face on the canvas didn’t look like her. Not really. The eyes, they weren’t hers.

I froze.

Not because of what I saw, but because of what it meant. How had she painted herself so many times without a single mirror in the house? And why so many abandoned mid-thought?

She’d always joked about her names. “Depends who I’m feeling today,” she said. Sometimes her middle name, sometimes her maiden, sometimes her first husband’s. I laughed along, but now it gnawed at me. Were these portraits fragments of who she’d been on different days? And if so, how recent? How many had been made in the last weeks, while I thought she was just resting?

I sank into a chair, shaking. Each canvas felt like a whisper. Each unfinished line a question I wasn’t meant to answer. The house wasn’t just a home, it was a record of her mind unraveling, painted layer by layer, secret by secret.

I needed coffee. The smell had always been grounding. But the kitchen had no modern maker, only that ancient percolator from the eighties, the kind with the tiny glass bubble on top.

I filled it, set it on the stove, and waited as the water gurgled. It should have been comforting, but the house felt heavier, like it was holding its breath.

On impulse, I peeled the sheet off the TV. Power on. Volume full blast. And my stomach dropped.

It was not the news.

It was us. My eleventh birthday. The living room. Cake. Balloons. Friends laughing. And her. My mom. But wrong. Movements deliberate, eyes darting where the camera didn’t follow. Too aware. Too present. And me, I remember noticing even then how different she was from other kids’ moms, how she spoke as if expecting me to notice things I shouldn’t.

I stumbled back. The coffee’s smell turned cloying. The percolator gurgled, wrong. Like it was straining to listen.

And the corners of the living room, on the TV, flickered with shadows. Small, fast, mimicking her. Not reflections, not real. Something between the room and the screen.

I ripped the cord. Darkness swallowed the living room. The percolator hissed, spilling a thin trail of coffee across the stove, as if it, too, had been watching.

I backed away, hands fumbling. The canvases loomed, whispering. For the first time, I realized, they weren’t half-finished. They were waiting. Waiting for me to see her, all the fragments she’d hidden.

I had to leave. Every step, every breath, I felt her watching. Not from the TV, not from the canvases, but from somewhere I hadn’t known existed.

I poured cold coffee and texted my wife I’d stay the night. I had to get a jump on cleaning, I told myself.

Morning came. Head pounding, weak, confused. I opened my eyes. The charcoal portrait was different. Finished.

Not completely, rough lines remained, but her face, younger. Decades younger, alive, mischievous.

I thought I’d imagined it. I poured a fresh coffee. Grounding. Then froze.

Charcoal smudges on the mug handle. Light, deliberate, like someone had pressed their fingers there while I wasn’t looking.

I hadn’t touched it. No one else had been here. And yet. There it was. Waiting.

1mrmwsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cognography/comments/1mrmwsq/cognography_faq_skimmable_version/,Cognography – FAQ (Skimmable Version),"# 1. “What even is Cognography?”

A Cognitive Positioning System (CPS) — like GPS, but for how you think. It maps Perception, Judgment, Structure into 27 coordinates. Cognition + Geography — mapping the mind in motion

[Image credit: Hans Holbein’s The Ambassadors — cropped](https://preview.redd.it/z3viigcfrbjf1.png?width=1212&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c93bf0696e3925b33bb0c96f991bca8a6bdf981)

# 2. “So… am I stuck in one box?”

No — think football formation.  
Before a match, you see the map of where players are. Skip that and go straight to the game, and you might not notice the structure — but it’s there.  
Every player knows their role, plays to their strengths. You won’t see a goalkeeper suddenly playing striker.  
I’ve just made that invisible structure visible.

https://preview.redd.it/remsn20iobjf1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=62e7abfe965e86e826bb19b7f2945aeb98c2159d

# 3. “What do you mean ‘where we sit in relation to one another’?”

It’s conceptual.  
That’s why all the conceptual types are at the top layer of the map — they tend to have more of a bird’s-eye view.  
Others are more concrete and detail-focused, working closer to the ground, seeing the texture and specifics up close. Both perspectives are essential — one provides the broad direction, the other ensures the details are solid.

# 4. “That’s not how I think.”

Some people say, “I don’t see my mind like a grid — it looks like a microchip.”  
That’s fine — it actually proves the system. Some of us think structurally, others don’t.

# 5. “Why would that prove the system?”

Because the way we organise our environment reflects how we think.  
Some people keep their room tidy without effort. Others need tools to help them organise. Neither is “wrong” — it’s all cognitive and structural.

When we drive, we follow roads. We don’t just go off-road in random directions, because it’s not efficient. This system is the same — it’s better than nothing. It’s simply a structured way to navigate thought.

# 6. “Why build it this way?”

I come from a creative background.  
When I studied art, we learned to draw the human form by starting with anatomy — the skeletal and muscular foundations — before breaking the rules.  
Cognography is the same: I’ve built an anatomical structure for the mind. Once you know it, you can apply or adapt it.

# 7. “What do you mean ‘map and map reader’?”

The system is intentionally clean and elegant — just a map (the 27 coordinates) and a map reader (BODIN).  
The next Cognography project will be completely different, but I want this one to remain minimal and timeless.

# 8. “Why use AI at all?”

Because cognition isn’t static. Neither is the world.  
I don’t believe the majority of people will be reading static text in 10 years — they’ll use dynamic systems that adapt to their exact situation.  
AI lets Cognography respond to your context instead of offering generic examples.

# 9. “Why is context so important?”

Everything in life is about context.  
If I did the test and it said “you like chaos,” but I don’t, that means I gave the wrong context.  
Online, context gets flattened — that’s why there’s so much division. Cognography restores enough context to understand where someone is coming from.

# 10. “So what does it actually map?”

Three core functions: Perception, Judgment, Structure.  
Like a shoulder muscle that looks like one lump, but is actually three parts — anterior, medial, posterior deltoid — each with a different role (pressing, raising, pulling).

# 11. The buckets analogy

Think of three buckets of different sizes:

* Pour a large bucket of water into a small bucket → it overflows.
* Pour too little into a large bucket → under-stimulation.

It’s about affordances — what a mind can actually process, not personality preferences.

# 12. “Why are all the coordinates the same colour?”

Because I believe in cognitive inclusivity.  
We often talk about inclusivity in terms of culture, background, or lifestyle — but rarely about how we think.

When driving, everyone follows the same road, but we all make different judgments and observations while doing it.  
This system shows those thinking differences without putting anyone “above” or “below” the rest.

# 13. “Why gold?”

Because I like golden retrievers.  
I want a physical model that blends high-tech AI with something natural, like wood grain.  
The gold is also a nod to valuing all cognitive types equally.

# 14. “Why did you build it?”

After learning about Carl Jung’s functions, I found I had Introverted Intuition + Extroverted Thinking.  
That means I naturally see patterns and organise them into systems — the same way some people organise tasks or people.

I’ve spent 20 years observing and organising patterns in my own life. Three years ago, I independently studied cognitive psychology every day until I saw the possibility to build something that wasn’t in a textbook — something reusable, visual, and easy to share.

# 15. “So AI is just the teacher?”

Exactly. The AI is there to help you learn the map until you can see the patterns yourself — like a sportsperson visualising a long jump before takeoff.

# 16. “Is this a Personality Quiz?”

No, this isn't personality typing.  
This is more like mirror–signal–maneuver in driving: a fixed sequence you follow, but applied to how your mind takes in, processes, and organises reality.

# 17. “Is it scientifically proven?”

Not directly. It’s rooted in 100 years of cognitive psychology — I just didn’t make a book.  
I made something you can look at and instantly see structure.

# 18. “How do I find my coordinate?”

Start with the three-question test. Then refine it like sculpting:

* Start with a big block of clay (your first result)
* Add more context — past experiences, creative work, decision patterns
* Keep refining until it feels right

It’s like cleaning dirty glasses — the more you polish, the clearer your vision. This system isn’t for skimmers; it’s for people who genuinely want to understand themselves.

# 19. “How accurate is it?”

As accurate as the effort you put in.  
I use it myself (my coordinate is CAS — Conceptual–Analytical–Scripted). I wouldn’t put out something I don’t trust.

It creates a landing strip for your thinking. Most of us fly without a flight path — we move towards destinations without clarity. That’s fine, but when problems arise, the interpretations multiply. Cognography shows the underlying structure for why things happen.

# 20. “What if I want evidence first?”

That’s fine — it reinforces your position in the system.  
Some of us want empirical evidence, some don’t. That’s one of the differences Cognography maps — the distance between two people looking at the same thing.

It’s like Van Gogh’s work: in his lifetime, few valued it. Now, it’s on coffee mugs everywhere, often without people knowing his struggles. Many only accept something once it gains social approval — and that’s fine. I’ve mapped that too: analytical types tend to approach from objectivity; sentient types seek human relatability first.

# 21. “Any real-world example of it aligning?”

Yes. 16 years ago, I created an album cover for The American Dollar (Atlas).  
On the inside, I drew an interpretation of multiple flight paths.  
For the actual cover, I used a photo I took flying over Switzerland — a bird’s-eye view of the Swiss Alps.

[The American Dollar - Atlas](https://preview.redd.it/lr61mazxmbjf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b656e4ccd49b9b8b94a26b3cb4d0db3b8be0d85d)

Looking back, I see I wasn’t just making art — I was visualising structure. Now I apply that same thinking to cognitive psychology, and it aligns perfectly.

If you have more questions, post them and I’ll add them to the FAQ.  
This is my interpretation of 100 years of cognitive psychology, distilled into something visual, reusable, and built to help people understand one another.

Final note:  
I come from a creative background. I spent the last 16–17 years making creative work — essentially content. Over time, I got tired of just making things to look at. I wanted to build something with utility, something that could genuinely help others.

After learning about cognitive psychology, everything fell into place. It felt like my previous work had always been trying to do this, but without any usable structure. That old work said, “Look at this cool artwork,” which is fun to a point — but eventually you want to do something more meaningful.

At the end of the day, this is just a guy who wanted to make something cool. We only have one life — let’s enjoy ourselves and build cool things. I finally feel like this is worth sharing, and I had fun building it. I just want to share that excitement with people who might connect with it… or not.",2,1755325425.0,Cognography,0,1.0,False

I wore a simple desi white top and jeans and then he shows up looking like a doberman-human hybrid—sharp jaw, built like THAT with broad shoulders, but cute face, bright smile, and kind eyes (Bumble, you really out here doing god’s work).

This man is not just attractive; he’s well-built, dressed so clean, smells suspiciously like earth and flowers, picked me up on a bike, and held my hand like I was about to fall into a canyon. Honestly, I was already emotionally committed. He rambled about nonsense but somehow we connected, then bought coffee without letting me see the bill.

The finale: he drops me home and hugs me like a literal human cage, and I cannot tell if I’m alive or in a Wattpad story. Also, I do not want to leave.

Then he texts me asking if I reached home safe (my apartment’s kinda huge), and then he says I’m an amazing person—obviously, I say the same. 

Next day, he asks to meet again because he wants to see me before his flight. But I’m such a wuss; I say no, like the protagonist who ruins all potential happily-ever-afters. Or maybe I avoided a red flag. I guess we’ll never know.

I’m just scared, ok? I have a hard time trusting people, but somehow… this will be memorable.

The Coffee Shop That Changed Everything ☕



There was once a young man named Arjun, who dreamed of owning a coffee shop in his small town. Everyone laughed at him.

They said,

""In our town? Nobody pays for expensive coffee!""



But Arjun had a belief — If you give people something extraordinary, they will come, no matter the place.



With little money, he rented a tiny corner shop.

He couldn’t afford fancy interiors, so he painted the walls himself, built tables from old wood, and learned latte art from free YouTube videos.



At first, sales were slow. Some days he sold just 2 cups. His friends advised him to quit.

But instead of giving up, Arjun talked to every customer. He remembered their names, their favorite drinks, even the days they came in.



Soon, people started visiting not just for coffee, but for Arjun’s smile and personal touch.



Within 2 years, the small corner shop grew into a franchise with 5 outlets.



When asked his secret, Arjun said:

""Don’t sell products, sell experiences.

And never wait for the perfect time — start with what you have, where you are.""





---



Business Lessons:



1. Start Small, Dream Big – Perfection is the enemy of progress.





2. Customer Experience Wins – People remember how you made them feel.





3. Consistency Beats Talent – Even the best ideas fail without persistence.",1,1755325415.0,InspirationBlog,0,1.0,False
