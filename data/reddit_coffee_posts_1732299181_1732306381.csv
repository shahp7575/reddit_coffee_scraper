1gxh00h,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenXWomen/comments/1gxh00h/colonoscopy_today_my_experience/,Colonoscopy today - my experience ,"I had my first colonoscopy today. I’m 53 and should have done it a few years ago but better late than never. 

I took the pills - 12, swallowed one a minute and washed down with 16 oz of water total. 

An hour later, 16 oz water over half an hour


30 minutes later, 16 oz water over half an hour


I repeated this again 4 hours later with 12 more pills + some more water. 

My tips I haven’t seen elsewhere:


If you tend toward being constipated, the day before you start your prep take some magnesium oxide - 400 to 800 mg. It’ll make you poop and make the later crapfest easier. I was coming off Wegovy and should have done this but I had an emergency and couldn’t and I regret it. It took 3 hours for the first set of pills to kick in and I wish I hadn’t vomited so many days of crap out of my butthole for 6 HOURS. 

If you take the pills and nothing happens after the 3rd round of water, drink hot clear chicken broth. Within 10 minutes of finishing it I started to go. 

Drink your water with a big fat boba straw. I could get 4-6 oz of it down at once and finished it really easily. I also took zofran 30 mins before each set of pills which helped. 

Diet Mountain Dew has caffeine for the morning when you can’t have coffee with cream. I drank it and tons of diet sprite and hot broth throughout the day and it got me through pretty easy, but I did have a decent headache from shitting out all my electrolytes. Next time I’ll drink more salty broth. 

The actual procedure - who knows how that went? I was out like a light and was dreaming intensely when they woke me with an all clear. I had just propofol and would recommend it. 

Try to get an experienced butt surgeon as your doctor for the procedure. My doc only refers people to them because they’re so busy and experienced and have seen it all vs someone who just does them but not cancer and more advanced surgery. ",1,1732305980.0,GenXWomen,0,0.67,False
1gxgzny,https://www.reddit.com/r/u__Nachtschleicher_/comments/1gxgzny/thank_you/,Thank you.,"I'm half in, half out these days.

I'm sure you have already noticed it.  You keep sending me encouragement over the chat line.  You've been through this before, haven't you?  What good would it do either of us to say anything about it, though?  It's not like it will fix anything, but I drink it up anyway.  The work still piles up and someone has to do it.

Calculated cells, policy drafts, letter drafts, report drafts, records requests, order requests, training presentations, performance checks, syntax checks, error code checks, background checks, signatures required, memorize those lines, re-write those manuals, convince them to do their work, build those bridges, connect those islands, research everything, interpret this, be a nag, we need a good shake-up, make those changes happen, but don't stir the pot, kill them with kindness, bridle and lead the cyclical hem-hawers, but don't be bossy, got to watch my back, mince my words, be political about it, don't let them see through this customer service smile, when's the next staff party?  Boss needs me.  Boss's boss needs me.  Really need to sit in on this meeting.  Last-minute meetings, emergency meetings, 4-hour meetings.  Don't forget to schedule more meetings.



Play the game, right?  My instincts are screaming.


What's the best burnout mitigation manual?  Because all I've got from my years of trauma is autopilot-mode, the million mile stare, dermatillomania, and workaholism.

Wake up before the alarm, search for your words that you've likely never had for me, go back to sleep, alarm goes off, struggle to get a grip, embrace in a hug, try not to break, chug black coffee, drive cross-county, unlock the doors, act like I know my day's schedule, stare at the screen.  Fuck around and find out.  Weaponize my encouragement toward those who weaponize incompetence.  Stare blankly some more. 

See the email auto-sort with the tedious rules I made to make everyone else's work easier.  Watch the numbers of unread messages tick up across the inboxes.  15...32...60...123...286...it's only been five hours.  Will I see you pop-up on my screen today?  Lock my door and hide for lunch.  Unlock the door before my allotted hour ends.  Keep going.  Answer questions of others welcomingly, beg for answers from the unbothered others.  Keep typing.  Ignore the lightning pain shooting down my arm.  Keep typing.  Lock the door.  Stay an hour more.

Let out a shaky breath.

Somehow I got things done.  How?  When?  Doesn't matter.  Hundreds of requests and questions have been, within a blur, whittled down to the teens.  And somehow I'm supposedly a leader?  How the hell dare I quantify how well my group performs their work when I'm barely functioning at what I do?  What am I even doing here?  Who the fuck do I think I'm fooling?

Go home.  Welcome home kiss.  I'm halfway in, halfway out, but you're happy and laughing, so that means I'm winning, right?  Am I doing this right?  You say I'm enough.  You're sure, right?  You're not just saying that because I asked you if I was the other night, right?  Why did I feel the need to even ask you?  Shouldn't I naturally feel like I'm enough with you?  I used to be so ballsy and confident.  Fridge is full;  Money's in the bank; so we should be okay, right?  Please?

Four hours before bedtime; make it count.  Stumble about, do some dishes.  I need to exercise...but the exhaustion hits.  The couch is so nice.  You made a lovely dinner.  I have no appetite.  Eat it anyway.  Scroll for a post I'll never find.  Keep refreshing the screen.  Try not to break.  Stare at the TV; a shared activity.  Half-hearted bonding.  More TV.  Nodding off...come back.  Time to go to bed.  Shower.  Brush teeth.  Take a melatonin.  Crash.  Hold the hand beside me.  Kiss.  Go to sleep.  Wake up.  2:00 AM.  Leave the bedroom.


Now, I can break.


Cry it out silently.  The animals come check on me.  Scroll, search, refresh, repeat, nothing's there.  Don't be so pathetic, I chastise myself.  I've had much worse.  Life is good.  I have no right to complain.  Get a grip.  The clock says I have two hours left.  Suck it up, buttercup.  Go to bed.  

Is there a hand beside you?  Yes?  Hold it.
No?  Then be the big spoon.  You've got to be bigger than this.  They're all depending on you, remember?  Drift off.

The alarm goes off.  Off I go, again.

Will there be a little light?  Am I really desperate enough to start a chat without a logical reason?  Will you pop-up on my screen today?  Then it gets harder to breathe...you showed up at my doorway.

You casually mention that you remembered...remembered that I like learning.  The word's straight from your lips.  I have to remember not to stare.  The link pops up in chat not long after.  Something lightens in me.  It's a free respite I can't afford...and as if you noticed the hesitation, it seemed like you went far beyond what I'd expect to pry a smile and a laugh out of me.  I think you saw that I need it more than I can admit.  I'll make it work.

Somehow, I manage to make it work.

I hope you realize that you're in that small group that makes my day brighter, just getting to see you.

I did two 72 and three 48h fasts this spring. I have been intermittent fasting for 2-3 years now a good part of the year except holiday months. Also, eating mostly low carb for the past 4 years or so. Switched from vegan into this due to my sugar spiking.

When I fast from a keto adopted state, I find it very easy to go to 72 hours. Only drinking black coffee. But at the 72 mark, I suddenly get very tired, sleepy and just super low energy. So I stopped both times.

Yesterday a friend mentioned that once you get through that, you can go on. I really would like to do a longer fast. One or maybe even two weeks if I can.

Any experiences with longer fasts and this 72h crash phenomena? How do you get through that?

I got one of them a personalized crewneck with pictures of his cat all over it but I'm not sure what to get for the other roommate, who admittedly is my favorite of the two by far so I'd like to get him something good.

He is a graphic designer with good style from Boston who loves consuming all Barstool sports media and thinks the Costco Boys and the Rizzler are hilarious. He's super Irish and visits his family in Ireland often. He's single but very independent in general. Loves to wake up on the weekends and go for long walks and get good coffee at new shops.

I have no idea what to get him. Last year I got him some air fryer liners, which I'll do again because he uses the airfryer most nights and blew through them all, and a robe that matched his comforter, that i've never really seen him use so must've not hit the vibe there.

1gxgsls,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildSupport4Men/comments/1gxgsls/mn_dad_with_child_support_concerns/,MN Dad with Child support concerns.,"Hello, 
I’ll give you a bit of context. Ten years ago I was a young 18 year old man that just graduation highschool. I met this wonderful 18 year old women that has also just graduated high school. We will call her B. Well B and I dated off and on for 10 years. It was more on than off though. It was only later in the relationship that we started having issues. We both came from not so great back grounds so we both didn’t really have any good role models in our lives. Three years into the relationship we found out B was  pregnant with a little boy. We were both young and scared but we had an idea on how to be good parents, just so the opposite of what our parents did and we should do just fine.
Seven years after our son was born, I came home from snowboarding to find her with a questionable look on her face. I asked about it and oddly enough we broke up. It wasn’t messy. We didn’t yell, fight, or scream. Because that’s what our parents would have done. She moved out shortly after that and we came up with a custody agreement that we both agreed upon mutually outside of court and went on with our lives. 
The agreement was that we would each have our son Monday through Sunday and then switch. In the late spring when I start work(I do road construction seasonally) B would take our son Sunday night- Friday afternoon and then I would have him for the weekend. Every weekend with the occasional sleep over during the week as our son requested. Also I offered for the time while I was working to send money for groceries, pay for sports, and summer care so she could continue to work during the summer months. B owns a small baking business that is ran out of my house and a small coffee shop in town. 
Fast forward to today when I got laid off from work. We can’t pour roads in the winter so now we wait jnt spring to start up again. I’ll get unemployment during the winter. B & I will also go back to our 50/50 custody agreement and I told her I won’t be sending money for groceries since we will be having him 50% of the time. 
Now let me be really really clear. I have no issue supporting my son. I have no issue making sure my son would ALWAYS be fed and have a roof over his head. I have zero issue with the idea of supporting him, but I do have an issue with the idea of supporting his mom while we’re not together. She is expecting me to send her 700-1199 a month or “we will go to court and this will get really messy”. As she claims at least. Now this is where my questions and concerns stem from.
1- From what I hear MN is really bad to dads and often favor the mother. Is that true?
2- As a father in Mn do I have any rights?
3- Would it be worth it for me to just fight it in court or would I be better off trying to settle outside of court? I feel pretty trapped honestly
4- Am I an asshole for contesting the child support payment to B? I feel like I’m being taking advantage of. I don’t feel as if I should have to support B. She’s an adult. 
Let me know any and all thoughts. If you read this, I appreciate you. Life hasn’t been easy with this lingering over me and honestly, if no one reads it. At least I got it out.

1gxgrvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerrunning/comments/1gxgrvm/getting_tired_at_40ish_minutes/,Getting tired at 40ish minutes ,"Hey guys!

I started running during summer only on the treadmill. Since the weather has cooled off I’ve been working on getting use to running outside. I run every other day with my “long” run still completed on the treadmill. I’m really slow at 14 minute miles but I’ve been focused more on endurance than speed so far. 

Anyway each week I’ve been adding one minute to my long runs. Earlier today was 47 minutes which I’m so happy I completed! But I’ve noticed once I hit about 40 minutes I start getting really tired and I have to dig deep to complete it. I really want to be able to run an hour or more once a week but I’m feeling discouraged. I’m only adding one minute a week and it doesn’t feel like it’s getting any easier. 

I have breakfast before I run. A cup of coffee and a glass of water. I sleep well 7-8 hours a night. I am in a slight calorie deficit of 250 calories because I want to lose a few pounds slowly (I’m super short).

Looking for top-notch noise-cancelling headphones? I've been trying out the Bose QC Ultra, and I'm impressed with what they offer.

These over-ear headphones pack a punch with their advanced features. I found the noise cancellation to be a step up from earlier models, creating a truly quiet environment. The spatial audio adds a new dimension to music listening, making songs feel more alive and immersive.

https://preview.redd.it/yf1pikozci2e1.jpg?width=905&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75fb68cb73b357aa7bd581ee5e12c0f8075da193

The sound quality is great, thanks to CustomTune technology that adapts to your ear shape. I noticed clear, crisp audio across different music genres. For calls, the mic system works well, focusing on my voice and reducing background noise.

Comfort-wise, these headphones shine. The soft ear cushions feel nice, and the headband spreads pressure evenly. I wore them for hours without discomfort. Battery life is solid too, lasting up to 24 hours - or 18 with spatial audio on.

One thing to note: while the touch controls are handy, they took some getting used to. The price tag is high, but the features match the cost.

# Bottom Line

The Bose QC Ultra headphones offer top-tier noise cancellation and sound quality. If you want a premium audio experience, these are worth checking out.



# Overview of Bose QuietComfort Ultra Bluetooth Headphones

I've been using these Bose headphones for a while now, and they're pretty impressive. The noise canceling is top-notch, making my surroundings super quiet. I love the spatial audio feature - it makes my music feel more immersive. The sound quality is great, and I can adjust it in the app.

Battery life is solid at up to 24 hours, but it drops to 18 with spatial audio on. They're comfy to wear, with soft ear cushions and a well-designed headband. Calls are clear too, as the mic picks up my voice well.

The touch controls work nicely, and I can pair them easily with my phone. While they're pricey, I think they're worth it for the features and sound quality. Just keep in mind they're a bit bulky for travel.

# Revolutionary Noise Cancellation Technology

I'm amazed by the noise cancellation on these headphones. The QuietComfort Ultra blocks out almost all outside sounds. I tested them on a noisy train and could barely hear anything except my music. There are three modes: Quiet, Aware, and Immersion. Quiet mode shuts out the world completely. Aware lets some sounds in, which is useful when walking around. Immersion mode combines noise cancelling with spatial audio for an incredible listening experience. The tech adjusts to fit your ears too. While they work great, the battery life takes a small hit when noise cancelling is on. Still, I got about 20 hours of use before needing to charge. For peace and quiet, these are hard to beat.

# Immersive Audio Experience

I was blown away by the QuietComfort Ultra's sound quality. The spatial audio feature creates a surprisingly realistic 3D soundstage. Music and movies feel more lifelike, as if I'm surrounded by the audio. The CustomTune technology adapts to my ears, making everything sound crisp and balanced. Bass is punchy without being overwhelming. Highs are clear but not harsh. I found the Immersive Audio mode especially impressive for music. It places sounds in front of me instead of feeling stuck inside my head. This works well for most genres, though I preferred it off for podcasts. Battery life takes a hit with this mode on, dropping from 24 to 18 hours. Still, the immersive experience is worth it for my favorite albums and films.

# Call Clarity with Advanced Microphone System

I was really impressed by the call quality on these headphones. The mic system did a great job focusing on my voice and filtering out background noise. I tested them in a busy coffee shop, and the person on the other end could hear me clearly without any distractions. The calls sounded crisp and natural, almost like I was talking face-to-face. It's a big step up from my old headphones where people often complained about echoes or muffled sound. The mic placement seems well-designed to pick up speech. I didn't have to repeat myself or speak loudly to be understood. For anyone who takes a lot of calls, these QC Ultras are a solid choice.

# Supreme Comfort for Extended Listening

I wore these headphones for hours without discomfort. The soft ear cushions feel great against my ears, and the headband spreads pressure evenly. I hardly noticed I was wearing them. The lightweight design didn't cause neck strain, even during long listening sessions. The over-ear style created a nice seal without squeezing too tight. I appreciated the premium materials used - they felt durable yet luxurious. While comfort is subjective, I found these to be some of the most comfortable headphones I've tried. They're well-suited for extended wear while working, traveling, or relaxing at home.

# Effortless Wireless Connectivity

I was impressed by how easy these headphones are to use wirelessly. They paired quickly with my phone using Bluetooth 5.3. The connection stays strong up to 30 feet away from my device. I can walk around my house without losing audio. The touch controls on the earcups make it simple to adjust volume, skip tracks, and take calls. Battery life is solid too - I get about 24 hours of listening time before needing to recharge. When I do need to plug in, it only takes 3 hours to fully charge back up. For TV watching, I like that I can sync these with a Bose soundbar to listen at my own volume without disturbing others.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using these QuietComfort Ultra headphones for a while now, and they've really impressed me in some ways, but also left me wanting in others. Let's break it down:

# Pros

* The noise cancellation is top-notch. I can barely hear anything around me when I turn it on.
* The sound quality is excellent, especially with the spatial audio feature. It makes my music feel more immersive.
* They're really comfortable. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort.
* The battery life is solid. I get about 24 hours of use before needing to recharge.
* The mic is clear for phone calls. People on the other end can hear me well, even in noisy places.

# Cons

* They're on the pricey side. The cost might be hard to justify for some.
* The touch controls can be a bit finicky. I sometimes activate them by accident when adjusting the headphones.
* They're not as compact as some other models. This makes them less ideal for travel.
* The app is needed for some features, which might be annoying for users who prefer a simpler setup.
* While the sound is great, bass lovers might find it lacking compared to some other brands.

I've found these Bose headphones to be a mixed bag. They excel in comfort and noise cancellation, but they're not perfect. The price and some minor usability issues hold them back from being a no-brainer choice for everyone. Still, for those who value sound quality and effective noise cancellation, they're worth considering.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using these QuietComfort Ultra headphones for a while now, and the feedback from other users seems to match my experience. Many people love the top-notch noise cancellation, which really stands out. The sound quality gets lots of praise too, especially in spatial audio mode. Comfort is a big plus for most users, with the headphones feeling good even during long listening sessions.

Battery life is solid, lasting through long days. Some folks have mixed feelings about the bass - it's good but not as deep as some rivals. A few users mention minor issues with the controls or fit. Overall though, most reviewers seem happy with their purchase, giving these Bose headphones high marks. The premium feel and looks are often noted as well.

# Conclusion

After spending time with these headphones, I'm impressed overall. The QuietComfort Ultras offer top-notch noise cancellation and great sound quality. I found the comfort level high for extended wear. Battery life is solid at up to 24 hours. While not perfect, they rank among the best wireless noise-cancelling options out there. The spatial audio feature adds an immersive touch. Some users may find the price steep, but the premium build and performance help justify it. If you prioritize sound quality and blocking out the world around you, these Bose cans are worth considering.",1,1732305296.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

1gxgmjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1gxgmjc/makeup_artist_made_me_feel_bad_on_and_after_my/,Makeup artist made me feel bad on and after my wedding day ,"I got married about 5 weeks ago, and reflecting on my wedding day has me mostly feeling happy thoughts overall! But my makeup artist made me feel kind of bad at several turns and I can’t help but feel sad about the service more than happy. The good news is that I loved the makeup. The bad news is that I’m very sensitive and the experience overall left me feeling sad.

To start out, I booked a highly reputable artist in Las Vegas where we got married. I was so excited looking at her Instagram for the last year since paying my deposit. I liked every single one of her posts and reels to show support. She presents herself on Instagram as basically a bad bitch, which I guess she is. And as someone who doesn’t tolerate BS. Sometimes she will post things on her stories to make a point about her makeup services, but it kind of comes across as shaming clients. For this reason, I was determined to be the perfect client and took in all the information possible in order to make her happy and have the best bridal makeup on my wedding day. She had posted something that suggested a lash lift for clients with straight or down pointing lashes. Noted. Suggested dermaplaning. Done. Posted about how great it is when clients offer food and coffee. My pleasure. The list goes on.

Well the morning started, and the makeup artist walks in and immediately starts talking shit about my hair extensions. They were a couple shades darker than my hair, but my stylist toned them and assured me they would blend (they did). She also kind of gave me a backhanded compliment saying I am so much more beautiful than she expected based off of my profile pic on Instagram. And she brought her preteen daughter with her who hung out in my hotel suite for the entire time my girls and I were getting ready. Afroman came on the Pandora station that my friend was playing that morning, and the makeup artist was upset and made us change the station when Crazy Rap came on since her daughter was in the room. At the time I felt really guilty and apologetic. But now I’m feeling annoyed that she brought her child to my bridal suite in VEGAS without asking to begin with… like what did she expect? Then when it came time to do my lashes, the MUA informed me my lash lift was over processed. I have never had one before and only did so at her recommendation. The MUA straight up told me I had fucked up by getting it done. Ultimately she decided maybe it was for the best that I had it done since I assured her my lashes are downward pointing dogs, but not before she told me I had fucked up several times. 
Before the makeup service ended, I asked her if she would mind touching up my fiancés forehead pimple that decided to grace us with its loud presence that morning. She made it seem like it wasn’t a problem, but I thought I sensed some annoyance there. Come to find out I was right about her being annoyed because last night she posted this on her Instagram story:
“A current trend that is happening...
I will be booked for a set of of makeups / services and I'm asked to do more then I'm contracted to do.
The answer is NO, I can't touch up your finances pimple, this is not respectful of me or my time”
I don’t know why but this really hurt my feelings. I’m a sensitive Sally for sureeee! But I tried so hard to not be made an example of on her stories, and I guess I had an oversight. What bride wouldn’t shoot her shot by asking the MUA to cover her soon to be husband’s giant red soon to be photographed in pictures that will last a lifetime pimple? She could have just said no, or said yes but it’ll cost ya. Either way, I tipped her $150 on the whole service which cost $270. Got her the oat milk shaken espresso thingy that she wanted. Continued to show support on her posts in the month since the wedding. And by the time she got to the pimple which took about 90 seconds of her time, she had already told me I would need to Venmo her $25 for another hour of parking since she had been there over the allotted 3 hours. Did I really do something highly offensive here? I can’t help but feel sad about being made an example of, even if she didn’t tag me in the post.

1gxglvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gxglvb/rant/,RANT!,"Today—today I’m losing it. I’m so fucking dysregulated I can barely think straight. I need to scream, I need to let this shit out before I explode. I didn’t sleep last night. At all. I was up all night, tossing and turning, spiraling around in my own head. And why? Because I feel completely lost. I feel like I’m drowning, and no matter how hard I try, I just can’t find a way out. I can’t find a fucking job. I’ve tried everything, I’ve done all the right things, but nothing’s sticking. Nothing’s fucking happening. I’m stuck.

I woke up at 5 am after a night of zero sleep, feeling like a zombie. I dragged myself out of bed, chugged three cups of coffee just to be able to move, and somehow managed to get a decent amount of work done. But none of it matters. NONE of it matters. I still don’t have a job. I still can’t figure out how to get back on my feet. And that’s all I fucking want. I need to find something, anything, that will give me some sense of stability. And I need to keep it. I can’t keep doing this cycle of hope, rejection, hope, rejection. I can’t.

Maybe—maybe I’ll just give up and be a stay-at-home mom. Is that so bad? Is it? To depend on someone else? A man? I don’t know. I don’t know what’s “right” anymore. I’ve been conditioned to think that’s the wrong choice, that it’s somehow weak. But isn’t that how it goes for some people? Some women? Can’t I just be happy in a different way? But then I think—no. No, I can’t. Because what if things go south? What if shit hits the fan? What if I’m left with nothing and no way to stand on my own? I don’t want to end up running back to my parents. I can’t do that. I won’t do that.

I am smart, goddammit. I know I’m smart. So why the fuck is this happening? Why does it feel like everything I try just slips right through my fingers? I’m giving it my all, I’m pushing harder than anyone knows, and it’s still not enough. I keep getting rejection after rejection, and every time I get up, try again, I just feel more drained, more hollow. I keep thinking maybe this time, maybe this one will be different, but it never is.

I can’t keep doing this. I’m reaching my limit. I’m running out of steam, and I’m running out of hope. I need sleep. I need real sleep, not this restless, broken, half-assed bullshit I’ve been getting. I need to reset, I need to feel like I’m not on the edge of fucking collapse every damn day. I need a fucking break.

I am so tired. I am so fucking tired. And I’m angry. Angry at myself for not being “normal.” Angry at my brain, my body, this damn ADHD that won’t leave me the hell alone. I can’t focus. I can’t get my shit together. I can’t fucking keep up. Why can’t I just be like everyone else? Why can’t I be the person who wakes up, does their thing, and just *succeeds*? Why do I have to feel like I’m clawing my way up a mountain every single goddamn day?

I hate this. I hate feeling this way. I hate this part of me. I hate that I have to fight so fucking hard just to stay afloat. And I hate that no one can see how hard I’m working, how much this is destroying me from the inside out. It’s like no one gets it, like I’m invisible. Like my struggle doesn’t count because it doesn’t fit into a neat little box. I am so fucking tired of it all. I’m so tired of fighting. I don’t know how much longer I can do this.

And I’m just… so fucking weepy. So tired and so broken, and I just want to curl up and disappear for a while. But I can’t. I can’t. Because the world doesn’t stop for me. It doesn’t care that I’m falling apart. It just keeps moving, and I’m supposed to keep up. But I can’t. Not today. Not anymore.",1,1732304989.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I've been testing out the Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, and I'm impressed with what these tiny earbuds can do. They're not just another set of wireless headphones - they pack some serious tech into a small package.

The first thing I noticed was how comfy they are. I wore them for hours and almost forgot they were there. The sound quality is excellent too. Music comes through crisp and clear, and I could pick up on little details I'd missed before.

https://preview.redd.it/kqt5yrgxbi2e1.jpg?width=1611&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5078f6c1f3c4ef8bb5fc22ba1e25ca26916c8934

The noise cancellation works great. It blocked out most of the noise around me, which was nice when I wanted to focus on my music or podcasts. But when I needed to hear what was going on, the ambient mode came in handy.

I liked the 360-degree audio feature. It made my music sound more immersive, like I was in the middle of it all. Calls sounded good too - the person on the other end said they could hear me clearly even when I was outside.

One cool thing is how the buds can sense when you're talking. They'll turn off noise cancellation and lower the volume so you can chat without taking them out. It's a small touch, but I found it really useful.

# Bottom Line

The Galaxy Buds2 Pro are solid earbuds that tick a lot of boxes. If you want good sound, comfy fit, and smart features, these are worth checking out.



# Unveiling the SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds2 Pro

I recently got my hands on the new Galaxy Buds2 Pro, and I'm impressed. These little earbuds pack a punch with their sound quality. The bass is rich and the highs are crisp, making my music sound great.

The active noise cancellation works well, blocking out most background noise. I can focus on my tunes without distractions. The fit is comfy too - I barely notice them in my ears.

One cool feature is the 360-degree audio. It makes music feel more immersive, like I'm surrounded by sound. The touch controls are handy for adjusting volume or skipping tracks.

Battery life is decent at about 4 hours per charge. The case gives extra juice when I'm on the go. While pricey, these buds offer solid performance for Samsung users wanting premium sound.

# Intelligent Active Noise Cancellation

I was really impressed with the Buds2 Pro's noise cancellation. The ANC does a great job blocking out background sounds, letting me focus on my music or calls. When I need to hear what's going on around me, I can easily switch to Ambient Mode. One cool feature is the Intelligent Conversation Mode. It turns off ANC and lowers the volume when it detects my voice, so I can chat without taking the earbuds out. This worked well in my tests, making it easy to order coffee or talk to coworkers. The ANC isn't perfect - some loud noises still sneak through - but it's very good for earbuds this size. I found it made a big difference on my commute and while working in noisy spaces.

# Hi-Fi Sound Quality for Audiophiles

I was blown away by the sound quality of the Galaxy Buds2 Pro. The rich bass and crisp highs really bring music to life. I noticed deep, punchy lows and clear, detailed highs across different genres. The buds use a dynamic driver that delivers studio-quality audio. I felt like I was hearing subtle nuances in my favorite songs that I'd never noticed before. The 360-degree audio feature adds an extra layer of immersion, making it feel like the music is all around you. While not quite on par with high-end over-ear headphones, these buds punch well above their weight for in-ears. Audiophiles will appreciate the balanced, accurate sound signature. The only minor downside is that the midrange can sometimes get slightly overshadowed by the bass.

# Immersive 360-Degree Audio Experience

I was blown away by the 360-degree audio on these Buds. The sound wraps around me, making music and podcasts more lifelike. It's like being in a concert hall or recording studio. Bass thumps with power, while highs sparkle clearly. I can pick out individual instruments and voices easily. The surround effect works great for movies too, putting me right in the action. It's not perfect though - sometimes the directional audio seems a bit artificial. Overall, this feature takes listening to a new level. It's hard to go back to regular earbuds after experiencing this immersive sound.

# Innovative Conversation Mode

I love how these Galaxy Buds make chatting easier. When I start talking, they automatically switch to a mode that lets me hear my surroundings. The music gets quieter and the noise canceling turns off. This means I can have quick chats without taking the buds out or fiddling with settings. It's really handy when someone asks me a question at work or while I'm out running errands. The buds pick up my voice clearly too, so the person I'm talking to can hear me well. This smart feature has made the Buds a big part of my daily routine.

# Comfort and Fit for All-Day Use

I found the Galaxy Buds2 Pro incredibly comfortable to wear. Their lightweight design and secure fit allowed me to use them for hours without discomfort. The earbuds come with different sized tips, making it easy to find the right fit for my ears. I barely noticed them during long listening sessions.

The snug fit also helped with noise isolation. Even without active noise cancellation turned on, they blocked out a good amount of background noise. This made them great for use in noisy environments.

One minor issue I noticed was that my ears got a bit sore after very long periods of use (6+ hours). But this is common with most in-ear headphones. Overall, the Buds2 Pro are some of the most comfortable earbuds I've tried.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using these Galaxy Buds2 Pro for a while now, and I've got a good feel for what works well and what could be better. Here's my take on the pros and cons:

# Pros

* Sound quality is top-notch. The bass is rich, and the highs are crisp.
* Active Noise Cancellation works great. It blocks out most background noise.
* They're super comfy. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort.
* The app is user-friendly on both phones and computers.
* 360 audio feature adds a new dimension to the listening experience.
* They're lightweight and small, making them easy to carry around.
* Battery life is solid for true wireless earbuds.

# Cons

* The touch controls can be a bit finicky at times.
* 360 audio only works with certain Samsung devices.
* The price is on the higher side compared to some competitors.
* The included instructions might be in Chinese, which could be a problem for some users.
* They don't have the best water resistance rating, so be careful during workouts.

I found these buds to be a big step up from cheaper options I've tried before. The sound quality and comfort are standout features. While they're not perfect, the pros definitely outweigh the cons for me. If you're looking for high-quality earbuds and don't mind spending a bit more, these are worth checking out.

# Examining Customer Feedback

I took a close look at what buyers are saying about the Galaxy Buds2 Pro. Most users praise the sound quality, noting rich bass and crisp highs. The active noise cancellation gets high marks for blocking out ambient sounds. Many find them comfortable to wear for long periods. The 360 audio feature is popular, creating an immersive listening experience.

Some users mention the buds fit securely during workouts. The companion app for mobile and PC gets positive feedback for its controls. A few buyers note the good value, especially when on sale.

There are some minor complaints. A few users wish for slightly better noise cancellation. One person mentioned receiving instructions in Chinese instead of English. Overall though, the feedback is very positive, with most users seeming happy with their purchase.

# Conclusion

After using the Galaxy Buds2 Pro for a while, I'm really impressed. They tick all the boxes for great earbuds. The sound is top-notch, with rich bass and clear highs. Noise cancellation works well to block out distractions. I found them comfy to wear for long periods. The app is easy to use on both phone and PC. While not perfect, they offer good value, especially if you catch them on sale. For Samsung users looking for quality wireless earbuds, these are a solid choice.

We met we discussed random things like what you do in your free time what does a day in your life looks like, i told him about one of my plans of going abroad for couple of months, he opposed so bad to the idea he was like no i want you to stay by my side, how am i going to see you ( like hell wtf is going on, am i skipping an episode or what, since when are we attached to each other ) we talked about marriage and everything 
When i got home i started thinking about the whole conversation, i found that he didn’t match my energy he was trying to act like we are the same, maybe cause he was charmed or something but i felt that we are not

I have 2 flights to get there. I just don’t want him to suspect anything bad, if he starts to suspect that I’m surprising him that’s fine, just not that I’m doing anything shady or cheating or whatever. so, basically, what can I say that sounds legit but not worrisome?

1gxghpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1gxghpe/the_personal_touch/,The Personal Touch,"I have a lot of friends.  Or, at least, that’s what my social media accounts tell me.  I would not recognize most of them by voice or by face, since I haven’t seen them, or spoken to them, in a long time.  Many of them have passed by my neck of the woods over the years, without giving a thought to reaching out and seeing if I’m around to get together.  I admit to the same; sometimes I feel “too busy”, sometimes I didn’t know that a friend lived near where I was traveling, and sometimes it just didn’t occur to me.  So much for being friends!  And this goes for family as well.  My only interaction with some of my friends and my family is by email or text.  Again: no face, no voice, no conversation.  Just words on a screen.

>Two are better than one: They get a good wage for their toil.  If the one falls, the other will help the fallen one.  – Ecclesiastes 4:9-10a

How wonderful it would be to greet these people face-to-face, or even voice-to-voice!  Whether they’re long-lost family members or old friends, there’s so much more of a connection when conversation happens in real-time.  Compare your reaction when you receive a message from one of them, vs. when they call you and speak to you directly; reading an email vs. meeting them over coffee.  I want to see them in person.  I want to hear everything they have to say.  I want to ask questions, get answers, and share what’s on my mind.

That’s how God feels about us!  Sometimes our conversations with Him can be superficial.  We’re not really in the moment, just sending up a few scripted words every now and then, and not really waiting around for a response.  What if we took the time to do it right, putting away our distractions and having a genuine conversation?  Wouldn’t that be a wonderful change?  Wouldn’t it be great to be friends with Him, and not just “friends”?

>Remain in me, as I remain in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own unless it remains on the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me.  – John 15:4

So we branches must remain connected to the vine.  Our friends and our family are also branches on that vine, and we must remain connected with them as well.  So I ask you: think of a family member or friend you haven’t spoken with in a long time, and reach out.  And do the same with the Lord.  He’d love to spend some quality time with you!  We pray:

>Lord, You traveled to visit your friends Mary and Martha in person.  Help us remember that the loved ones in our lives deserve our presence, and we theirs.  Help us remember that You also deserve our undivided attention.  Break down the walls that we build, which isolate us from each other, and from You.  Unite us again as one Body: Yours.  **AMEN.**",1,1732304682.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

The sound quality is crisp and clear, with natural vocals and balanced tuning. I was impressed by how well they blocked out background noise, thanks to their dual noise sensor tech.

Battery life is a strong point. I got about 35 hours of use on a single charge. When I did need to power up, a quick 3-minute charge gave me an extra hour of playback. The built-in mic works well for calls, picking up my voice clearly.

I liked being able to connect to two devices at once. It made switching between my phone and laptop easy. The headphones also have Alexa built-in, which I found handy for voice commands.

# Bottom Line

I think the Sony CH720N headphones are a solid choice for anyone wanting good sound and noise cancellation without breaking the bank. They're comfy, sound great, and have tons of useful features.



# Overview: Sony WH-CH720N Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones

I've been using these Sony headphones for a while now, and they're pretty good. They're super light - the lightest noise-canceling headphones Sony has made. This makes them comfy to wear for long periods. The noise canceling works well, blocking out most background sounds.

The sound quality is clear and balanced. I can hear vocals and instruments clearly. Battery life is great too - I get about 35 hours of use before needing to charge. A quick 3-minute charge gives me an hour of listening time, which is handy.

One cool feature is the ability to connect to two devices at once. I can easily switch between my phone and laptop. The built-in microphones pick up my voice well for calls.

While the lightweight design is nice, the headphones do feel a bit plastic-y. The padding also flattens out some over time. But for the price, the CH720N offers good value for noise-canceling headphones.

# Sony's Lightest Design

I was impressed by how light these headphones feel. At just 3.5 ounces, they're barely noticeable on my head. The over-ear cups are comfortable for long listening sessions. I wore them for hours without any discomfort. Sony used recycled plastic and metal to keep the weight down. This makes them great for travel or commuting. The sleek black design looks stylish too. While they're lightweight, they still feel well-made and durable. The built-in controls are easy to use. One downside is they don't fold up for compact storage. Overall, the CH720N strikes a nice balance between comfort and quality.

# Advanced Noise Cancellation

I was really impressed by the noise cancellation on these Sony headphones. The Dual Noise Sensor tech and special processor work together to block out most background sounds. I tried them in a busy coffee shop and could barely hear the chatter around me. They're not perfect - some loud noises still sneak through. But for the price, the noise canceling is very good. I like that I can adjust the level of cancellation or let in some ambient sound if I want to hear what's going on around me. It's a nice feature when I'm walking outside and need to stay aware of my surroundings. Overall, the noise cancellation helps me focus on my music or calls without distractions.

# Comfort for All-Day Wear

I found these Sony headphones surprisingly comfortable for long listening sessions. The lightweight design, at just 192 grams, made a big difference. I barely noticed them on my head after hours of use. The padding on the ear cups and headband felt soft and didn't cause any pressure points.

One small issue I noticed was that the padding flattened a bit over time. This didn't affect comfort much, but it's worth noting. The adjustable headband helped me get a good fit.

Overall, these are some of the most comfortable over-ear headphones I've tried. They're great for all-day wear at work or while traveling. The light weight and good padding make them easy to forget you're wearing.

# Impressive Battery Life

I was really impressed by how long these Sony headphones last on a single charge. I could use them for days without needing to plug them in. The 35-hour battery life is no joke - I wore them on a long flight and still had plenty of power left. Even better, a quick 3-minute charge gives about an hour of listening time in a pinch. This came in handy when I forgot to charge them before heading out. The USB-C charging is fast and convenient too. Overall, the battery performance on these headphones is a standout feature that makes them super practical for everyday use.

# Sound Quality and Features

I was impressed by the audio performance of these Sony headphones. The sound is clear and well-balanced, with crisp highs and deep bass. Music comes through exactly as the artists intended. Noise canceling works great, letting me focus on my tunes without distractions. I like being able to adjust the ambient sound mode to hear my surroundings when needed. The built-in mics pick up my voice well for calls. Battery life is excellent at up to 35 hours. Quick charging is handy - just 3 minutes gives an hour of playback. Multipoint connection lets me easily switch between my phone and laptop. The DSEE feature enhances compressed music files nicely. Overall, these deliver high-quality sound with useful smart features in a lightweight package.

# Pros and Cons

After spending some quality time with these Sony headphones, I've got a pretty good handle on what they bring to the table. Let's break down the good and not-so-good parts.

# Pros

* Super lightweight at just 192g, making them comfy for long listening sessions
* Great noise canceling thanks to the Dual Noise Sensor tech
* Long battery life - up to 35 hours on a single charge
* Quick charging feature is handy in a pinch
* Clear sound quality with natural vocals
* Easy switching between two devices with multipoint connection
* Hands-free calling works well with the beamforming mics

# Cons

* The lightweight design means they feel a bit plasticky
* Padding might flatten over time with regular use
* Some features require using the Sony app, which can be a hassle
* Bass could be stronger for those who like a punchier sound
* No option to use them wired when the battery dies

I found these Sony headphones to be a solid choice for everyday use. The light weight is a big plus - I barely noticed them on my head even after hours of wear. The noise canceling did a great job of blocking out background noise, letting me focus on my music or podcasts.

Sound quality is crisp and clear, though bass lovers might want a bit more oomph. The long battery life is a lifesaver, and the quick charge feature has saved me more than once when I forgot to plug them in overnight.

On the downside, the lightweight build does make them feel a little less premium than some other models. I've also noticed the ear cushions starting to flatten slightly after a few months of heavy use.

Despite these minor gripes, I think these headphones offer good value for the price. They're comfortable, sound great, and have some neat features that make daily use a breeze.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using these Sony headphones for a while now, and I'm not the only one impressed. With over 7,000 ratings on Amazon, they've earned a solid 4.4 out of 5 stars. Many users praise the clear sound quality and deep bass. The noise canceling gets lots of love too - it really helps block out distractions.

Comfort is a big plus for most people. The headphones are lightweight and don't squeeze too tight. Some folks mention the padding flattens over time, but it hasn't been a deal-breaker.

The Bluetooth connects easily to different devices, and the battery life is good. A few users wish they came with a carrying case. While some think they feel a bit plasticky, most agree they're well-made for the price.

Overall, customers seem happy with the value these Sony headphones offer. They're not perfect, but they tick a lot of boxes for everyday use.

# Conclusion

After using the Sony CH720N headphones for a while, I'm impressed with their performance. These lightweight wireless headphones offer good sound quality and effective noise cancellation at a reasonable price. The long battery life is a big plus, lasting through many listening sessions. While the build feels a bit plastic-like, they're still comfortable for extended wear. The app adds useful features, but some may find it tricky to use at first. Despite a few minor drawbacks, these headphones are a solid choice for everyday listeners who want a mix of features and value. They're not perfect, but they get the job done well for most people's needs.",1,1732304588.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False
1gxgg1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gxgg1a/am_i_actually_stupid/,Am I Actually Stupid?,"Hi all, great question, I know.  I am coming to you more as a way to vent but also looking for any sort of advice you may have. 

Long story short, I don't know if I am actually stupid or not.  I can prove on paper that I'm not - I have a high school and college degree, a decent job, I pay rent, I have a girlfriend, I moved across the country alone and am still making it alive.  I am competent is what I'm getting at here.  The stupidity that I am questioning is much smaller than that, however.  

A great example are two events that unfolded last night.  Rather harmless, tiny events that shouldn't matter, but somewhat knocked me on my rear.  Firstly, I was showering while my girlfriend was getting ready for a concert we were going to go to (she ended up not going as she wasn't in the mood).  I have super thick hair, so I have to use coco butter in my hair, which i had in a mason jar as that was how it was packaged.  The mason jar fell and shattered in the shower as it was an honest mistake.  My girlfriend was quick to have me turn off the water, pick up the big pieces, then she vacuumed up the small ones.  Normally, we would laugh at this, right?  Wrong.  She was already frustrated, and because of this instance, she didn't speak to me for the next hour, even though I asked if she was upset and apologized for my mistake.  I am not saying she did ANYTHING wrong, but why did that make me feel like such a fucking idiot???

Second, this morning, I was about to leave for work, and I leaned down to give her a kiss on the shoulder as she was sleeping and facing the other way.  I had just sipped my coffee (not real coffee, won't stain, it's okay) and planted a kiss on her shoulder, and left a wet spot from the coffee the size of a Lego stud.  She immediately whipped around and went, ""are you stupid??"" and somewhat ridiculed me for this.  Of course, it was an accident, and the small droplet of liquid on my lip that I was unaware of was under my radar.  I apologized to her for that, but she seemed to be kind of upset about it.  I left for work and have been stewing about this since. 

Both of these events are minor and no one was hurt.  I'm a grown man and I know that everything will be fine.  I just wonder, am I actually lacking brain cells?  Do normal people think of these things before they do them?  What's wrong with me?  Why are people so hard on me for what seems to be small mistakes?  Should I simply not make as many mistakes?  What do I do to feel more confident in my intelligence and competence?

After discussing buying a home together, I have been having serious second thoughts about our relationship and am having trouble giving it my all. 

As I mentioned, we briefly discussed buying a home together. I put an end to the house hunt after I had second thoughts that I was ready to settle down with her for my life, and since then I have been trying to pinpoint the exact reason why. 

Good things: We get along well, she understands my humor and we constantly are finishing eachothers sentences. It sometimes feels honestly crazy how in sync we are, and thats one of the main reasons I'm leaning toward staying in the relationship. We are both in good financial standing, we cohabitate well, she is reasonable and not irrational. In contrast, I did not cohabitate well with my ex, she was not reasonable and was irrational - always wanted things her way. I got away from that with my current girlfriend and I like this dynamic much better, but also leads me to what I believe the issue is.

Issue: While my GF is reasonable and rational, she is an anxious person, provides very little input, has little drive/ambition to improve herself, and feels more like a dependent than a partner. When we thought about buying a house, I started thinking about our future together - a home, kids, life partners. I am ambitious in terms of my job and self improvement. My GF considers her job just a source of income and often expresses how she would like to be a housewife (She has also expressed that she does not want kids for years, but when I told her I'm thinking I will want kids in the future, she claims to have changed her mind). I even helped her get out of her comfort zone and start working a ""passion"" side job as a fitness instructor. She enjoyed this for a bit which showed promise, but she has started to loathe it after \~6 months. I find myself working toward promotions/certifications, thinking about ways to develop financially (rental property, fixer upper, starting a business) and I can tell she is not truly interested in any of these things (except how me doing them can improve her financial position and she might not have to work anymore). 

If it was up to her, she would probably work part time at a coffee shop and spend her leisure time watching reality TV and scrolling TikTok while I work double time to support us and work toward my own goals. Not that that is unacceptable, but I constantly find myself wishing I had someone to push me to be better and think outside the box. Someone who shares this passion to be the best that we can be. Someone who wants to discuss things like current events or work every once in a while. I worry that her dependent approach to life might leave me always pushing us forward and making the more difficult decisions - where to buy a house, where to send our kid to school, how to parent our kid, etc. I want someone who will help me make these decisions and not just ask me the question and go with my answer.

All this to say, since I've realized this I've had real hesitancy moving forward in our relationship and giving it my all. I feel withdrawn almost like I am looking for a way out. I don't know how to discuss this with her without just insulting her, and I feel that forcing her to become this ""better"" person is really just forcing her to be how I want her to be. At some point when she realizes this, I think she'll become resentful that I didn't just let her be who she wants to be. I almost feel taken advantage of as if she has found someone who can provide for her and who she feels comfortable with. I also feel comfortable with her, but feel I want more.

**My question is:** How do I navigate the tension between wanting a partner who is more engaged and ambitious, without pushing her to change in a way that feels like I’m trying to force her into a mold that isn’t authentic to her? How can I have an open, honest conversation with her about my concerns without damaging our relationship or making her feel inadequate? Is it possible for us to find a balance between her more laid-back nature and my drive, or are we fundamentally incompatible in this regard?

TL;DR - I \[26M\] feel a fundamental difference in terms of intelligence/drive/ambition with my GF \[26F\] of 3 years.

So my Shiba has always had a swaying butt, which i learned today is pretty common for shibas.  
But she's been with my parents for the past couple days and they noticed that she had been limping a bit and was really lethargic. When I picked her up last night, they said had a really good day before and had no more troubles the night i picked her up.

Today, no problem going for a walk to the coffee shop but on the way back i noticed she was walking a lot slower and limping a bit which gradually turned to really limping by the time we got home.

We get inside, and shes perfectly normal with her walk. I thought maybe there was something in her paw, but nothing. I try moving her legs around a bit, no screams or crying. I called my vet, and the receptionist did recommend I bring her in..... but that's what they always say for everything tbh.

Currently going to monitor this through the weekend.

Anyone else experience this? And does everyone here recommend just taking her to the vet? (the reason why I ask is because the visit will cost about $500 if they include X-rays, and I'm currently unemployed so I would like to avoid the visit as much as possible)",1,1732304137.0,shiba,0,1.0,False

The foundation of Capitalism is property rights and what are property rights IRL? Pieces of paper that say, ""this belongs to me people better not touch it without my permission!"" The Capitalists are no different than the geeks in school who sat at their own geek-table in the cafeteria and spent most lunch periods talking about their favorite Collectible Card Games, except the papers they trade around represent property with more value than Pokemon Trading Cards.

If someone violates a Capitalist's precious sacrosanct property what does he do? He does nothing, except get the Police Pigs to threaten people and probably frame-up some poor black kid to scapegoat. Fuck with a Capitalist's property too much, or even instill the slightest perception of a threat in them and what do they do? Pick up their ball and run somewhere else! The quisling Media ran about a thousand stories on Walgreens shuttering stores over shoplifting. Not armed robbery where men with ski masks and rifle shoot up the place and then shove all the cash and drugs into a duffel bag, but homeless people stealing candy and aspirins. America also has a long history of White Flight which carries on today. Petit Bougie Whites are so terrified of living among racial minorities that they'll all run for the hills if they even get the idea minorities might soon be a significant part of their neighborhood's population.

It used to be that American Fascist media, like the Death Wish movies, would focus on White Vigilantes that got fed-up with the ineffectual Lib-coded Police and went on to deliver their own brand of brutal justice to thugs. Now American Fascist media is an even more pathetic fantasy than that: all the shows feature Police and Prosecutors as the heroes and anyone who isn't one of them is either a useless victim or depraved crook. The Vigilante movies were at least a Power Fantasy for ""normal"" White people, whereas this new Copaganda just lets the audience Hero-Worship for cops, who anyone who leaves their house can see are just fat, lazy, sacks of pigshit who spend 90% of their day sitting in their huge patrol SUVs sucking up free coffee.

America has the fattest population in history and the typical American spends 97% of their time sitting around and most have no hobbies unless you count watching a screen. Since so many Americans are simply too unhealthy to participate in physical activities that have been traditionally considered manly we get ridiculous performative masculinity instead. Remember when Bacon was a forced meme around 2010 and everywhere we saw ads about how awesome and manly eating bacon was? Yeah, congestive heart failure from stuffing your face with pigs is SO MANLY. It even became a culture war symbol for the far-right who decided that bacon is to Muslims what silver is to a vampire and used it as a socially-acceptable code for hating on Muslims.

He asked me recommendations. I told him I'm no expert but I like the one I grabbed. He grabbed a bottle and then non-chalantly invited me join him for a drink. I chuckled and pretended he was joking. Was he joking? I don't know, I left without a second glance.

Good ideas don’t come from staring at a blank screen waiting for inspiration to hit like lightning.

And the ones who consistently hit it big like Elon musk. They have a system for finding new ideas that actually work. And today, I’m handing you those tools which you can use.

Here are 2 techniques which can work for you guys:

1. Solve a real problem people Complain About

Where do you find problems? Everywhere. Pay attention to what people complain about:  
Maybe scroll through reddit threads or read the 1-star reviews on Amazon.

2. Also sometimes stealing a winning Idea but doing It smartly

For example, take an idea that’s already working somewhere else and make it better. Maybe look at what’s booming in another city, country, or industry. Add a twist. Simplify it. Niche it down. Examples? Uber didn’t invent taxis. Starbucks didn’t invent coffee. They just did it better.

Also spend some time checking Facebook groups, forums, or TikTok trends.

I also work out (well, at least until last month) twice a week (Pilates + strength training). I’m about to turn 40. I’m a bit lost. 🥲 Today I managed to stop the pain at the onset by taking 1 sumatriptan + 1 paracetamol with 30 mg codeine. A doctor prescribed me the cocodamol but I asked about triptans after reading some threads here. He reluctantly agreed to prescribe me sumatriptan, but only 6 pills as he didn’t think it’d help me. He also suggested the cocodamol?? Doesn’t make much sense. I don’t like the idea of using codeine unless sporadically. It’s been a heck of a year and I’m very resilient but this is next level. I’m also taking magnesium, omega3 and D3 for my other health issues, but never had any side effects. Any ideas? ☹️",1,1732302506.0,migraine,1,1.0,False

The Capitalists are no different than the geeks in school who sat at their own geek-table in the cafeteria and spent most lunch periods talking about their favorite Collectible Card Games, except the papers they trade around represent property with more value than Pokemon Trading Cards.

My father’s partner went to work today so that means I got to be there with my father. He probably doesn’t even need someone to be there with him at this point, but I don’t like to leave him alone either. 

I haven’t been having any work lately, so I’m able to be there for him. The lack of work does concern me somewhat. But it’s to be expected since it’s the holiday season. The banquet business is always slow during this time of year since everyone is in vacation. I can’t even find much jobs at the moment because of that. I think I’ll have to find another way to make cash. I might end up doing a Depop side gig.

Anyways, I mainly worked on my homework or wrote. My dad was still passed out, dude likes to stay up wake. He drinks a couple cups of coffee each day, and he is surprised when he isn’t able to sleep easily… It’s better than pounding down modelos or coronas like he used to do. 

He eventually got up, so I had to help him out of bed. That’s probably one of the few things he still needs assistance with. Gave him his meds. Ate some breakfast together. If I do move out, I’d be sad not having that company anymore. Also helps that our relationship is in a better place now. Used to be much rockier before, but we understand one another now.

I worked on this glossary type thing for my profile, [Journaling Highlights from 2023-2024](https://www.reddit.com/u/InTheSkyCity/s/VIZCyDO5lN). I had been wanting to do something like that for my profile for awhile now. I never didn’t because I figured it would take me quite a lot of time to do so… It barely even took me an hour to do. 

Well, setting it up took me that long, reading up my past entries took longer than that. 

God, it made me realize how much of a awful person I was. I clearly wasn’t in a good mental state. I know that isn’t an excuse, but damn, I was just messy more than I should’ve been. I’m embarrassed by some of the shit I wrote. I like to think I’m not that person anymore, but there’s only one way to find out. By not being that person.

Also made me realize how much of a shitty boyfriend I was. I considered that relationship I was in last year, the healthiest relationship I was in until the end of it. But after reading these entries… it was pretty clear that it wasn’t fucking sunshine and rainbows at all. I have no clue how I managed to think that it was. 

It was pretty stupid of me to get into a relationship when I was numbing myself with 10 edibles each day, and that doesn’t even include how I was beginning to smoke as well. It was pretty selfish of me to have not considered his feelings more at that time either. I’m surprised he stuck around for as long as he did. Yet I broke up with him to “better myself”. And did I do that? Sure as fuck didn’t. We still got back together anyway, I don’t know why we did, clearly wasn’t for the best looking back. And that isn’t mentioning how my manic behavior and low self esteem played a role in everything falling apart. 

I need to stop blocking the bad shit I’ve done or that’s happened to me, we have to use those moments as a reminder to ourselves to be better. 

Lately, I’ve been doing good. But I’m going to have to permanently keep it that way. I don’t want to have the same life that I was having then. I don’t want to be that kind of person anymore to those around me or to myself. If I really love or care for someone, why involve negativity? What good would that do? I did a lot of dumb shit. 

I need to be better. Not just by saying it, by being it. So I’ll be doing that. 

I also watched the Timberwolves game against the Raptors, damn, it’s hard to be a fan right now.

1gxfk7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gxfk7i/aita_for_telling_my_mom_and_boyfriend_their/,"AITA for telling my Mom and boyfriend their inheritance plan is off?
","I’ve been struggling with this as I don’t want to sound greedy, but it has more to do with issues we have with our stepsister. Anything we might inherent is a bonus, I did nothing to earn it, but it feels weird for someone else to receive it.



For context, my mom is 61, and her boyfriend, “Rob” is early 50’s. My sister, (F30) and I, (M28) don’t care for Rob’s daughter, Hannah (F22). Our mom and Rob bought a house together in another state when my mom retired; however, he is able to work from home and continues to work. The issue is this, our Mom paid for more than ¾ of the downpayment, as well as the monthly mortgage, however, they have stated that when it is passed along, Hannah will receive half, while my sister and I split the other half. This is where my sister and I took issue.This is where it feels uncomfortable, our mother pays for much more than half, so it is odd to my sister and I that Hannah will be getting the lion's share of the inheritance.   
  


For more context, Hannah works in a smoke shop, has no plans, no goals, spent 3 years lying about going to college and fleecing her mother and Rob of tuition money only for them to find out she never so much as even applied to a college let alone used any of that money for school expenses, and she downright refuses to attend family gatherings, events, holidays etc. Her and I even live in the same city, and she does not even reply when I have invited her to dinner, coffee, or anything. I see her about once a year when Rob is back in town and the 3 of us have dinner.



My sister and I have a great relationship with Rob, both of us independently going on trips with just him, events, etc. Conversely, our mom also strongly dislikes Hannah, to the point that my mom REFUSES TO LET HER VISIT. (They live on a beach now.)



When we brought up that we didn’t think it was a fair split, our mom was strangely quiet. It wouldn’t be like Rob to pressure her, but she kept saying this was how it was for now.



A touch more context: my sister and I both have careers, would like to start families, not really well off, but not doing poorly. Hannah constantly needs help with rent, car payments, and everyday bills. This girl was given over 30k in the last 2.5 years and spent ALL of it, from what we heard, she didn’t have any consequences for her little charade. Last bit, our mom and Rob have been together 13 years, so we’ve known her since she was young, and all known each other since high school.



Am I/my sister the a\*\*hole for thinking that if anything, we should have a split based on their split? Based on the house location and all the other factors, it would just be sold when our mom goes. I struggle very hard because it feels like I’m moral high roading, but it also feels just genuinely unfair that Hannah would be able to continue to do nothing with my mother’s money.

1gxfiw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gxfiw9/mf_beauty/,[MF] Beauty ,"(Content warning: discussions and thoughts about death, >!murder!<)

His eyes snapped open suddenly. He thought about the suddenness of death. How quickly it seemed to sneak up on those who were not prepared for it. The quickness with which it claimed its victims. Death, by nature, was unexpected. It didn't matter how long you knew about it or how much you thought you had prepared, in the end death came suddenly to everyone. He was more than acquainted with death, long ago he had banished the fear of death. Banished the fear of anything, most emotions actually. He still tried to think though, every day. He tried to think about death and life, and living and dying, and beauty, the beauty in the small things, and when he could, the beauty in the big things, the constants and unchangeable things of life. 
He woke up every morning suddenly, not out of fear or because something had startled him, he had long since removed those instincts from his mind. Rather, he awoke suddenly because it was morning now, time for him to get up and get on with his day. He never stayed in bed long anymore, the warmth and closeness never held any joy for him. Instead, he went into the bathroom to brush his teeth.
After he was done in the bathroom, he walked into the kitchen and paused. Golden sunlight mottled with the brilliant emerald of summer foliage was dancing on his floor. The colors seemed to play with each other as they traced their way across the kitchen. They kissed the edge of the countertop and froliced on the opening blooms of the orchid he had placed in his window a week ago. He walked over to the window, watching as the dappled sunlight ran over his body almost as if inviting him to join in the fun. He looked out the window, watching the sunlight peeking through the swaying branches. He, almost impulsively, opened the window and took a deep breath. The smell of the fresh leaves embraced him, and if he listened closely, the twitter, hum, and songs of the birds and bugs hidden deep within the foliage almost drowned out the sound of the morning street below him. 
He thought about the beauty of nature.

The closing of his apartment door behind him broke him out of his reverie. He thought about the closure of death. The seemingly utter finality of it. No one he’d ever met had ever come back once they’d truly died. Once death came for you, that was it, and no one seemed to know what to make of what came next. He thought one thing was for certain, death was final, a closing of the life you had lived.
He walked out of his building and onto the street. The building next door was having some renovations done on its face, so he stopped to watch the workers on the scaffolding for a minute. He observed the way that they seemed to work in complete harmony. There seemed to be no wasted motion as they toiled in the already hot sun, busy as a colony of ants. He watched the way the sheen of sweat across their faces and arms caught the sun in odd ways. The contentment on weathered unshaven faces as they called out to one another, exchanging information about the job here and a jest or two there. The satisfaction of work done correctly and efficiently. The symmetrical structure of the staging and the changes being done improving the overall appearance of the building. 
He thought about the beauty of labor.

The jets of air from above were cold as he walked into the supermarket. He thought about the coldness of death, the unfeeling, uncaring coldness of death. Death did not care who you were or what you were doing, it came for everyone when it was their time. It didn't care about your protests or vain supplications, you died, and death didn't care with a unique coldness.
He watched the people around him as he gathered his few small essentials; he didn't need much these days anyway. He watched as a young couple strolled by, both of them pushing their cart. The man's hand was around her waist and she was gazing up at his face, smiling at whatever he was quietly saying to her. He saw a middle aged mother cradling a child on her hip. The child was sleeping soundly on her shoulder with the safety of her arms around him. As he walked towards the registers he saw an elderly man reading a newspaper, his wife quietly tucked into his side watching him right back. He looked as she turned her head to watch a toddler stumbling by holding tightly to her father's finger. He saw the smile that lit up the old woman's face.
He thought about the beauty of love.

The plastic roof of the bus station mercifully protected him against the harshness of the sun's growing heat. Was it selfish to be sad about someone finding something that was by all appearances peaceful?
He sat and waited for his bus and watched the people around him. He saw a man sitting on another bench whose left leg was in a cast. He watched that man and started to notice things. He noticed the rhythmic tapping of the man's other foot. He noticed the muscles in the man's crossed forearms and how they moved and rolled under the skin, undulating in neverending waves. He watched the sheen of sweat on the man's forehead glistening in the sun as it bled through the semi-opaque roof. He watched the muscles near the man's mouth moving in and out, and the forced deep breaths that moved the man's shirt as it swayed in the slight breeze causing new patterns to play. The man sat up abruptly and reached into his pocket for an orange prescription bottle. He watched as the pill caused stillness in the man's movements, erasing the erratic patterns of before.
He thought about the beauty of pain. 

The quiet of the coffee shop was a relief after the business of the city streets. He thought about the quietness of death. No matter how much you railed ineffectually against the supposed wrongness of it all, once the true moment of death came, everyone was silent. Death was ushered in on the soundless sheets of the ghosts who had gone before and the mute wings of the one who brought it. No one screamed after the seeming peace of death took him.
He walked through the quiet of the coffee shop, around a lattice strung with fake ivy and to a booth set at a distance away from anyone else. He sat down in that booth across from a strange man. The man looked up in surprise, but before a word was spoken he struck. A quick stab to the throat was all it took and then the man could no longer scream. The man slumped forward into his newspaper and coffee.
He watched the man die without remorse. Death was the nature of things after all. This was the labor he had chosen, and while he felt no love for it, he did not feel any pain either. He watched as the man bled out in front of him. The blood pooled on the table and dripped onto the floor creating living, changing patterns that belied the death that was in the air. He ran his eyes over the mosaic of alabaster and beige and scarlet that the broken mug made on the table. He looked at the way the ruby ran up the ivory of the newspaper, deepening the ebony of the words. He observed the gentle slope of the man's shoulders, more relaxed than even during sleep. He listened as the patter and drip onto the floor created something close to music.
He thought about the beauty of death.

I will tell you some stuff he does in hope you tell if does were signs or am just in delusion.Firsst l gotta tell you that lgbt is not very acceptable in my country so it's quite hard situation. Whenever l try to give him ""signs"" some of our mutual friends tells me for example ""why are you putting you head on his armwrest"" or ""why are you holding his hand"" (and almost evryone in this country  is homophobic so coming out is not an option) so it is hard to flirt with him without someone noticing.
So these are the signs he gives me: he treats me different from other boys like he is more gentle and calm with me trying not to hurt me and offend me and whenever someone from our friend group hits me he defends me. I mean we can not flirt with each other too much because people are always around us like the best time we had to flirt was at a school trip because we were sitting next to each other and then he asked me if l wanted to sleep om his armwrest its okay l asked him if he was sure and he told me ""yes, whenever l go home with this one friend l sit next to a window on the bus and l put my head on the window and he puts his head on me"". I am very touchy like putting my arms around him, hugging him, leaning over on him putting my head on his armwrest, and l asked him if he doesn't mind that and he said no so... I think l noticed that he responds more to my touching when we are further away from other people like once we were sitting together in class and l touch his hand with my pinky like tinkled him and he did that to me too. Once when l didn't have a jacket and he had his he asked me if l wanted his jacket, he told me once that he was in love with a girl but he added that that girl was acting like a boy like in our language there is a word for those but ln English it doesn't exist it's like a girl who is acting like a boy. He really cares when l am angry at him he is going to apologize to me and give me attention even if he was right in argument. I know that he supports lgbt because l asked him, first time we got to this topic he was like ""you agree with what they are doing"" that was like a year ago and now the earliest conversation about this topic we had he accepted them too and agreed with me with everything l said like l told him that l wanted to get earpirsed and if he would support with that and he told me that he will support me but if was anyone else like our mutual friend he would laugh at them does are word he said. When we catch eye contact they are longer then normal but sometimes he turns his head away but still whenever he turns his head we have eye contact for a few seconds at least.We do not sit next to each other in class but whenever a sit opens next to him l try to sit there but whenever seat opens next to me he doesnt sit next to me he once said that it is because he doesn't want to be that leaves a person that is sitting next to him but that girl whenever a seat opens next to one of her friends she leaves him there alone(it's not very common for students in our class to miss school so there is not a lot of times where the seats open). But when l try to make a plans with him to go for coffee he wants to call someone from our friend group too but he treats me a lot better then our other friends like he never hits me he never says something bad to me, but he does that to our mutual friends and as l said when someone of does friend hits me or make fun of me je defends me. So l don't know if he is in love with me or he is being just a good friend or is he gay at all?

","When I stumbled across *Nagano Tonic*, I didn’t expect much. After trying countless wellness supplements that promised rapid weight loss and endless energy, it felt like I’d seen it all. But after reading up on *Nagano Tonic* and seeing its ingredient profile, I thought, “Why not give it one last shot?” What’s different about this tonic, I found, is its blend of ancient, natural ingredients that target weight management by addressing the root causes of weight gain: stress, metabolism, and even cravings.

Within the first week, I felt an unexpected surge of energy. Not the jittery, caffeinated kind, but a stable, steady stamina. I’d start my mornings with a glass of water mixed with *Nagano Tonic*, which easily became a refreshing part of my morning routine. That sense of sustained energy kept me productive throughout the day and helped me stay consistent with my goals without needing an afternoon nap or extra coffee.

By the second week, I noticed my cravings had mellowed out—a huge win for me. I didn’t have the usual urge to snack, especially on sugary treats, which had always been a struggle. This change wasn’t instant, but I realized I was naturally gravitating towards more balanced meals without forcing it. A blend of ingredients like ashwagandha and EGCG from green tea seemed to be doing their job, subtly supporting my body in ways I didn’t think were possible. My overall mood was better too, and that made sticking to healthier choices easier.

Then came the weight loss. After a month, my clothes started fitting better, and the scale showed I’d lost a noticeable amount of weight without a strict diet or grueling workouts. My body felt lighter, my digestion had improved, and I was even sleeping better—possibly thanks to the adaptogenic herbs that help regulate stress and cortisol. By month three, I had dropped nearly 20 pounds, a milestone I hadn’t reached in years, even when I was doing intensive workouts.

One thing I appreciated was that *Nagano Tonic* isn’t marketed as a miracle weight-loss solution. Instead, it targets sustainable health, blending natural superfoods like camu camu and mangosteen that work with the body to boost metabolism, lower inflammation, and support overall vitality. Unlike other products that left me feeling deprived or anxious, *Nagano Tonic* felt gentle but effective.

For me, *Nagano Tonic* has become more than a supplement. It’s a system that helped me restore balance in my body, naturally curb cravings, boost my energy, and support healthy weight loss. I didn’t have to make radical changes; I simply added this tonic into my routine. It’s safe to say that it’s been one of the best investments in my health journey.

# [👉Click here to visit Nagano Tonic's Official website](https://tinyurl.com/r8k7rx2n)

The science behind *Nagano Tonic* lies in its careful selection of natural ingredients, each chosen for its unique contribution to metabolism, energy, and weight management. This formula draws on traditional ingredients, blending them into a tonic that supports the body’s natural processes to promote a healthier, leaner physique without extreme diets or workouts. Let’s dive deeper into some of these powerful components and how they work together.

One of the standout ingredients is **Camu Camu**, a superfood high in vitamin C and antioxidants. Known for centuries in traditional medicine, camu camu works by boosting metabolism and offering a steady energy lift without caffeine. Its antioxidants also help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which are often underlying contributors to weight gain and sluggishness. This allows the body to process fats and sugars more efficiently, directly supporting weight loss efforts.

Then there’s **Mangosteen**, a nutrient-packed fruit rich in fiber, which aids in feeling full and supports a balanced digestive system. This natural fiber not only promotes satiety but also enhances digestion, helping the body process and eliminate waste effectively. Mangosteen is also noted for containing xanthones, which have anti-inflammatory properties. By reducing inflammation, mangosteen may help improve metabolic health, making it easier to shed excess weight and maintain energy.

**EGCG**, a catechin found in green tea, is one of the most well-documented antioxidants. EGCG boosts metabolism and aids in fat burning, as several studies have shown. By increasing the thermogenic effect (the rate at which the body burns calories to produce heat), EGCG can amplify calorie-burning even without exercise. Furthermore, it’s known to enhance the body’s resilience to oxidative stress, another factor in maintaining a healthy metabolism.

A unique aspect of *Nagano Tonic* is its use of **adaptogenic herbs** like **Ashwagandha** and **Panax Ginseng**. Adaptogens help the body adapt to stress by stabilizing cortisol levels, which are often elevated in response to stress and can lead to fat storage, particularly around the abdomen. Ashwagandha is especially beneficial in managing cortisol, which in turn can reduce stress-induced cravings. Panax Ginseng, on the other hand, enhances vitality and supports mental clarity by helping regulate blood sugar, which may reduce the likelihood of energy crashes and associated cravings.

Lastly, **Momordica Charantia**, commonly known as bitter melon, plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism. Bitter melon has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, allowing the body to use sugars more efficiently for energy instead of storing them as fat. This is particularly helpful for those who struggle with blood sugar management or experience sugar cravings.

*Nagano Tonic* isn’t just a weight loss supplement—it’s a multi-dimensional health tonic that supports the body’s metabolic and hormonal systems holistically. By integrating these scientifically backed ingredients, it offers a natural path to sustainable energy, effective metabolism, and balanced weight management.

It’s simple: mix one scoop with water or your favorite beverage, such as a smoothie, once a day. Most people prefer taking it in the morning to experience a sustained energy boost throughout the day.

Nagano Tonic is made from natural, non-GMO, and vegetarian ingredients, and it’s generally well-tolerated.

Some users report slight digestive adjustments during the first few days, but these typically subside.

**3. How soon can I expect results?**  
Many users start noticing increased energy and reduced cravings within the first week, with more visible weight loss typically occurring after a few weeks of consistent use. However, results vary depending on individual metabolism and lifestyle.

**4. Is it safe for long-term use?**

While *Nagano Tonic* is generally safe for most adults, it’s not recommended for pregnant or nursing women or anyone with serious health conditions unless approved by a doctor.

","When I stumbled across *Nagano Tonic*, I didn’t expect much. After trying countless wellness supplements that promised rapid weight loss and endless energy, it felt like I’d seen it all. But after reading up on *Nagano Tonic* and seeing its ingredient profile, I thought, “Why not give it one last shot?” What’s different about this tonic, I found, is its blend of ancient, natural ingredients that target weight management by addressing the root causes of weight gain: stress, metabolism, and even cravings.

Within the first week, I felt an unexpected surge of energy. Not the jittery, caffeinated kind, but a stable, steady stamina. I’d start my mornings with a glass of water mixed with *Nagano Tonic*, which easily became a refreshing part of my morning routine. That sense of sustained energy kept me productive throughout the day and helped me stay consistent with my goals without needing an afternoon nap or extra coffee.

By the second week, I noticed my cravings had mellowed out—a huge win for me. I didn’t have the usual urge to snack, especially on sugary treats, which had always been a struggle. This change wasn’t instant, but I realized I was naturally gravitating towards more balanced meals without forcing it. A blend of ingredients like ashwagandha and EGCG from green tea seemed to be doing their job, subtly supporting my body in ways I didn’t think were possible. My overall mood was better too, and that made sticking to healthier choices easier.

Then came the weight loss. After a month, my clothes started fitting better, and the scale showed I’d lost a noticeable amount of weight without a strict diet or grueling workouts. My body felt lighter, my digestion had improved, and I was even sleeping better—possibly thanks to the adaptogenic herbs that help regulate stress and cortisol. By month three, I had dropped nearly 20 pounds, a milestone I hadn’t reached in years, even when I was doing intensive workouts.

One thing I appreciated was that *Nagano Tonic* isn’t marketed as a miracle weight-loss solution. Instead, it targets sustainable health, blending natural superfoods like camu camu and mangosteen that work with the body to boost metabolism, lower inflammation, and support overall vitality. Unlike other products that left me feeling deprived or anxious, *Nagano Tonic* felt gentle but effective.

For me, *Nagano Tonic* has become more than a supplement. It’s a system that helped me restore balance in my body, naturally curb cravings, boost my energy, and support healthy weight loss. I didn’t have to make radical changes; I simply added this tonic into my routine. It’s safe to say that it’s been one of the best investments in my health journey.

**EGCG**, a catechin found in green tea, is one of the most well-documented antioxidants. EGCG boosts metabolism and aids in fat burning, as several studies have shown. By increasing the thermogenic effect (the rate at which the body burns calories to produce heat), EGCG can amplify calorie-burning even without exercise. Furthermore, it’s known to enhance the body’s resilience to oxidative stress, another factor in maintaining a healthy metabolism.

A unique aspect of *Nagano Tonic* is its use of **adaptogenic herbs** like **Ashwagandha** and **Panax Ginseng**. Adaptogens help the body adapt to stress by stabilizing cortisol levels, which are often elevated in response to stress and can lead to fat storage, particularly around the abdomen. Ashwagandha is especially beneficial in managing cortisol, which in turn can reduce stress-induced cravings. Panax Ginseng, on the other hand, enhances vitality and supports mental clarity by helping regulate blood sugar, which may reduce the likelihood of energy crashes and associated cravings.

Lastly, **Momordica Charantia**, commonly known as bitter melon, plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism. Bitter melon has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, allowing the body to use sugars more efficiently for energy instead of storing them as fat. This is particularly helpful for those who struggle with blood sugar management or experience sugar cravings.

*Nagano Tonic* isn’t just a weight loss supplement—it’s a multi-dimensional health tonic that supports the body’s metabolic and hormonal systems holistically. By integrating these scientifically backed ingredients, it offers a natural path to sustainable energy, effective metabolism, and balanced weight management.

**1. How do I take Nagano Tonic?**  
It’s simple: mix one scoop with water or your favorite beverage, such as a smoothie, once a day. Most people prefer taking it in the morning to experience a sustained energy boost throughout the day.

**2. Are there any side effects?**  
Nagano Tonic is made from natural, non-GMO, and vegetarian ingredients, and it’s generally well-tolerated.

Some users report slight digestive adjustments during the first few days, but these typically subside.

**4. Is it safe for long-term use?**  
Yes. *Nagano Tonic* is designed for sustainable, long-term use, combining ingredients that support general health, not just short-term weight loss. Its adaptogenic herbs, probiotics, and antioxidants contribute to ongoing well-being, which can be beneficial beyond weight management.

While *Nagano Tonic* is generally safe for most adults, it’s not recommended for pregnant or nursing women or anyone with serious health conditions unless approved by a doctor.

**8. How is it different from other weight loss supplements?**  
Unlike many weight loss products, *Nagano Tonic* targets root causes of weight gain, such as stress, metabolic health, and cravings. Its unique blend of adaptogens, probiotics, and antioxidants works synergistically, promoting a holistic approach to health.

","When I stumbled across *Nagano Tonic*, I didn’t expect much. After trying countless wellness supplements that promised rapid weight loss and endless energy, it felt like I’d seen it all. But after reading up on *Nagano Tonic* and seeing its ingredient profile, I thought, “Why not give it one last shot?” What’s different about this tonic, I found, is its blend of ancient, natural ingredients that target weight management by addressing the root causes of weight gain: stress, metabolism, and even cravings.

Within the first week, I felt an unexpected surge of energy. Not the jittery, caffeinated kind, but a stable, steady stamina. I’d start my mornings with a glass of water mixed with *Nagano Tonic*, which easily became a refreshing part of my morning routine. That sense of sustained energy kept me productive throughout the day and helped me stay consistent with my goals without needing an afternoon nap or extra coffee.

By the second week, I noticed my cravings had mellowed out—a huge win for me. I didn’t have the usual urge to snack, especially on sugary treats, which had always been a struggle. This change wasn’t instant, but I realized I was naturally gravitating towards more balanced meals without forcing it. A blend of ingredients like ashwagandha and EGCG from green tea seemed to be doing their job, subtly supporting my body in ways I didn’t think were possible. My overall mood was better too, and that made sticking to healthier choices easier.

Then came the weight loss. After a month, my clothes started fitting better, and the scale showed I’d lost a noticeable amount of weight without a strict diet or grueling workouts. My body felt lighter, my digestion had improved, and I was even sleeping better—possibly thanks to the adaptogenic herbs that help regulate stress and cortisol. By month three, I had dropped nearly 20 pounds, a milestone I hadn’t reached in years, even when I was doing intensive workouts.

One thing I appreciated was that *Nagano Tonic* isn’t marketed as a miracle weight-loss solution. Instead, it targets sustainable health, blending natural superfoods like camu camu and mangosteen that work with the body to boost metabolism, lower inflammation, and support overall vitality. Unlike other products that left me feeling deprived or anxious, *Nagano Tonic* felt gentle but effective.

For me, *Nagano Tonic* has become more than a supplement. It’s a system that helped me restore balance in my body, naturally curb cravings, boost my energy, and support healthy weight loss. I didn’t have to make radical changes; I simply added this tonic into my routine. It’s safe to say that it’s been one of the best investments in my health journey.

The science behind *Nagano Tonic* lies in its careful selection of natural ingredients, each chosen for its unique contribution to metabolism, energy, and weight management. This formula draws on traditional ingredients, blending them into a tonic that supports the body’s natural processes to promote a healthier, leaner physique without extreme diets or workouts. Let’s dive deeper into some of these powerful components and how they work together.

One of the standout ingredients is **Camu Camu**, a superfood high in vitamin C and antioxidants. Known for centuries in traditional medicine, camu camu works by boosting metabolism and offering a steady energy lift without caffeine. Its antioxidants also help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which are often underlying contributors to weight gain and sluggishness. This allows the body to process fats and sugars more efficiently, directly supporting weight loss efforts.

Then there’s **Mangosteen**, a nutrient-packed fruit rich in fiber, which aids in feeling full and supports a balanced digestive system. This natural fiber not only promotes satiety but also enhances digestion, helping the body process and eliminate waste effectively. Mangosteen is also noted for containing xanthones, which have anti-inflammatory properties. By reducing inflammation, mangosteen may help improve metabolic health, making it easier to shed excess weight and maintain energy.

**EGCG**, a catechin found in green tea, is one of the most well-documented antioxidants. EGCG boosts metabolism and aids in fat burning, as several studies have shown.

So I (M39) broke up with my gf (F34), of 4 years about a month and a half ago. It was very sad, as I loved her dearly but now i'm better, trying to improve myself, focused on my work and projects, you know the drill. I tried doing as much no contact as possible with her after the breakup, she has initiated contact several times.

We met up a couple of times later after the breakup, one to have a chat and grab a beer (ended basically in her shouting  at me about the issues of our breakup, etc. I was calm and once she finished venting I told her I think it's best if take you home). And second meeting, was similar, she was just picking up some stuff at my place that she forgot when she moved out, Both times I was calm, even trying to be nice and excited because I was seeing her again, but the second time she was even more mean and  started to accuse me of kicking her out of the house in a vulnerable state. (I was the main breadwinner in the home). Now she's basically sending nonstop dms demanding an apology in person for kicking her out in a vulnerable state. I'm not replying, because I already apologized to her several times in person about the specific issues of the breakup.

For more context: I consider I didn't kick her out, the thing is that I put my foot down on an issue that I felt was important and she refused to acknowledge, and she went with it. For the past year, if we had an argument for whatever reason she would decide to leave, and avoid talking about the issue afterwards. First time it happened she left the bed and slept in the couch. Second time she left the house and rented a hotel for the night. 3rd time she left 2-3 days to her mom's house. Next time she left 5 whole days to her mom's house. As you can see things escalated. After this told her that we weren't roommates, we were a couple that lived together, that if we had issues we needed to talk them out, that leaving like that is passive aggressive AF and that I wouldn't tolerate it any longer. So basically we broke up because after our last argument, she told me she was gonna leave for TWO WEEKS to a female friend's apartment. This was unacceptable. So immediately I told her, I won't accept this, if you want to leave for two weeks you have to take your things and go. So she accepted and left and later that week she moved out.

The day we had our final argument, it was a Sunday. The day before we had an amazing day, all 3 (me, my partner, and my daughter)of us, we had breakfast at a great restaurant, we went to the museum, later had dinner with my partners friends at our house, ended the night with a movie, slept cuddling each other, no issues whatsoever about my daughter's tech usage or her mom came up. We woke up early around 7am, and then she went to make some coffee she saw that my teenage daughter was already awake, sitting on my computer. She came back to bed, and told me 
- ""Your daughters awake and she's at the computer""
. And I was like ""Ok?"" 
She replied, ""Go do something about it"". 
""Babe, what do you want me to do?""
""Go talk to her""
""Babe what do you want me to talk to her about, she's just awake, is she playing games?""
""No""
""Then why are you making such a fuss about this, I don't understand.""
""It's not a fuss, and she's your daughter""
""I know she's my daughter, but your my partner, you can also tell her things if you aren't comfortable about something, also she's not doing anything wrong, and she has 3 hours of tech usage according to our house rules, and she can use it at whatever hour she wants to. Do you want me to tell her to go sleep again?""
""No""
""Then what's the issue babe?""
Discussion worsened after this...
.... After this point things escalated and I have to admit I eventually lost my cool, and told her to fuck off, something along those lines. I apologized for this of course, in person later that same day, but the damage was done.

What were we arguing about? Things related to my daughter's mother (she basically tells me that I live under her (my daughters' mom) control, because she travels a lot, and randomly, so sometimes I get less than a week's notice that I'll have to take care for my daughter for two weeks or more) things related about my teenage daughter and her technology usage (phone, tablets); she wanted me to be more strict , I was more lax about it, etc. Rules were in place, and enforced, but she was very particular about the details, on the other hand I was more laid back (?) So for example if my daughter had two of hours of gaming, if her gamematch still had 5 minutes left on the two hour mark I would let her finish it. My former partner would argue that I had to be strict and turn off the PS5 if necessary. Apart from that, we worked together on projects, we had a great sex life (several times or more per week, for 4 years, yes including the last week), we dated constantly, we cooked for each other regularly, we travelled together. I honestly thought we could work these other issues out, like a balancing act, but I guess I was wrong on my assessment.",1,1732301567.0,CoreyWayne,3,1.0,False

I got called into the high school for a disciplinary committee meeting. Something I wasn’t in the mood for since I had just had left a boring staff meeting and I only had one cup of coffee before I got the call. 

Well, I got to the meeting and heard something that just pissed me off. Two 10th grade boys decided that during their first period was the time to spout their racist political views. When their PE coach (a Latino male) blew his whistle and called the class to gather up for warm up, one of the boys yelled out “We don’t answer to wetbacks!”.

The coach was apparently stunned by this and ask the kid “What did you say to me?”. To which the other boy chimed in with “We tell you what to do. Like go mow my lawn.”

The coach then handed off the class to another PE teacher and escorted the two boys to the office. Apparently they told the coach that once Trump comes into power that he and the rest of the “wetbacks” will be thrown out of the country. 

The assistant principal interviewed the boys about what happened and they freely admitted saying those things. The disciplinary committee was then called to convene and the students parents were call. 

After hearing from the AP and the PE teacher, we decided that 3 days of OSS was called for. They will have after school detention for a week upon their return and have to write a two page (hand written and single spaced) letter of apology to their teacher and the class including why racism is wrong. In addition, they are also both on the basketball team. Now they are no longer on the team.  

I asked the PE teacher if he wanted them transfer to another PE coach and he said no. He said he can handle them once they return. 

I wasn’t there for one of the parent meetings, but the AP said that the mother showed up and seemed pissed and ashamed at how her son behaved and agreed to the punishments. The parent whose meeting I did attend didn’t seem to angry. Both the mother and father were there. They said that their son should have said those things to a teacher. 

Not that he shouldn’t have said those things or that they wrong to say/think. 

The father seemed more mad that his kid is off the basketball team. He said “How is my son supposed to get a scholarship if he doesn’t play? Can’t he just miss practices while he’s suspended?”

However she struggles immensely with relationships. She feels that she *needs* to be polygamous and have several ongoing relationships in addition to the one with her fiancé (22F). However she is so eager to build her polycule that she is frequently finding herself and her fiance emotionally and on occasion physically hurt. She has also lost many friendships because some of her friends care more about their lovers than they care about the friendship with her, wich makes her very jealous and on several occasions she has entered relationships with friends disregarding the friend’s lover or spouse. In addition to this she is constantly going on tinder dates seeking new members for her polycule but most of these people have turned out to be violent or simply there for a brief physical encounter.She is frequently left devastated by the constant conflict that arises from her polyamorous lifestyle. 

I personally cannot understand polyamory, and i have never seen such a relationship appear to be healthy, but i also understand that people need different things in life and what works for me(strict monogamy) absolutely wont work for her.  But it seems that every time we meet for coffee or video games, the conversation gets back to her relationship troubles and she becomes defensive and angry if i mention that maybe she should slow down with the polyamory especially because her fiancée was recently physically/sexually hurt by their last partner. Im not sure what i am supposed to do in the situation, i dont want to sound like an uptight biggot or a prude, but i dont see how i can help her heal if i am not able to question her lifestyle. And we have agreed that i should not be giving advice to her because she says that she only wants emotional support but it hurts me badly to see her continue to be hurt and sometimes ruin other people’s relationships and not be able to do anything besides affirm her. I feel like, by boosting her confidence and encouraging her to keep trying i am contributing to the worsening state of her mental health and the health of her lovers and fiancée.",3,1732301301.0,AITAH,12,1.0,False
1gxf5gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Special_Shirt5357/comments/1gxf5gy/its_a_day/,It’s a day,"We had a small catastrophe last night. His wound vac broke and when we called to get a replacement, we were told that he has to reverify eligibility through his doctor and this, they would not send replacement parts for the vac until his eligibility was reverified. Hiccups like this really upset him. He’s been going through this for so long already and these things keep happening and he feels like there is no end in sight. I really feel for him. I tried to remind him that if there is not anything we can do in the moment then we just have to do the “next right thing” and at that moment, the next right thing was for him to go to sleep and get some rest. I don’t think it helped at all but I know he appreciates it when I de-catastrophize these things. He had a doctor appointment this morning and that went well. We have wound care in the afternoon. Not sure what we are going to do the whole weekend without his vac but it doesn’t seem we have a choice. Luckily we have no major events planned this weekend. We can stay home and deal with it. 
Sleepy joe is using my blanket before it is ready. Silly goose. He’s cracking me up because he likes to sleep on my granny squares. I thought he was just sleeping on them because they were in his way but he is seeking the projects out to sleep on them and that softens my heart towards him a little. He hasn’t been as annoying as of late so that’s good. lol. Blueberry is especially needy these days. He follows me around the house mewing his little baby cry until I pet him. My whole day revolves around making sure the little baby has all of his pets in lol. So funny. 
I suspect it may be time to detox from coffee again. I had high BP at the chiropractor and then I woke up in the middle of the night with a racing heart that same night. I probably should see a doctor for this stuff. And lady stuff. Like I said the other day, I should start caring for my shit. 
I am always on mister to take care of himself but I don’t always take the best care of myself medically and that’s kind of hypocritical of me to do. I just hate going to the doctor so much. Though my experience with the chiropractor was awesome. So I should get over this. 
We are planning our Thanksgiving. We have to stay home because of his wound and since he was JW he has almost zero attachment to the holidays. Of course. I always wind up with people who don’t give af about the holidays lol. They mean something to me now because of everything that has happened in the last 10 years. Frankly, I used to be a real grinch about the holidays. I literally hated them. But as I have been on my own, It’s been important to me to take them back. For a lot of reasons. He was dead set on not celebrating holidays and I was like “hold on. We can make the holidays belong to us. We can celebrate them how we want to”. He was not convinced but then his doctor mentioned cooking for the holidays and then mister got excited. He’s been planning our thanksgiving meal and it makes me really happy. We are both going to cook it together. I’m a much better baker than him so I’ll be responsible for the breads. We are just going to do side dishes this year. 
Last night we talked about how exciting it will be to have a space where we can invite all of our friends over for dinner and board games. I don’t really care for board games but our friends do and he does. The last time the “six pack” had a board game night, I tagged along knowing I wasn’t super interested in playing the game. But m and b have an amazing porch and so I spent the night in their porch watching raccoons and swinging on their porch swing. It was an awesome night and I thanked them for not making my separation from the group an issue. I was “hanging out-adjacent” and that works for me. So anyway, the space we saw yesterday will be awesome for get togethers. I need to look at some barstools for the island in the kitchen. Exciting stuff . Lots to look forward to in the coming months.

“What? Spill the tea!” she urged, her eyes wide with curiosity.

“Well, you know how Tommy’s dad is super nice and always so friendly? He came home right as I was getting Tommy ready for bed. I thought he was just checking in or something, but then he… he leaned in for a kiss!”

“No way!” she gasped, covering her mouth. “Did you kiss him back?”

“Of course not! I was totally caught off guard. I took a step back and was like, ‘Whoa, Mr. Thompson!’ It was so awkward! I was scrambling to remind him I was just there to babysit.”

She laughed, shaking her head. “What did he say?”

“He quickly corrected himself, saying he got confused. I don’t know if he was joking or just completely misreading the situation! But I could tell he was embarrassed—his face turned bright red. I was so glad Tommy didn’t see it!”

“No kidding! You handled that like a pro,” she said, still chuckling. “So, what’s your plan now? Are you going to babysit again?”

“Definitely! I need to see what Mr. Thompson does next. But I’m keeping my distance for sure!” We both burst into laughter, the ridiculousness of it all swirling in the air between us.",2,1732301234.0,teenagers,1,1.0,False

1) It doesn't matter if it was 5 years ago, you are still the same nasty bitch you were in HS, what's your point?

2) I know you're lazy ass won't open another business again because you're a lazy bitch (IMO) who can't afford employees to run it for you and definitely can't afford jet setting vacations anymore and you would actually have to work it yourself 😱

3) I am SURE the CEO of Target doesn't talk shit about their customers. He's a multi millionaire and knows where his bread is buttered. But for a small business owner like yourself who begged customers to shop your cheap Zenana BS so you could pay your employees because you couldn't at the time, you probably should not have spoken like this about or to them. Its almost as if your rotting soul was detectable through your fake BS, especially when you told your customers to leave if they didn't like you. 

P.S. I was up at 430am for work, like you were up at 530am for work because you are a poor, just like me. I had 8 glorious hours of uninterrupted sleep and got up and had coffee and brekkie with my husband, whom I sleep in the same bed with (and is a total smoke show to boot. Right, Matt?)

Pam, there are wolves amoung you. Lmao. I love how you crop out context from my posts here to post on your personal page. I also love how youre not talking about the law suit with them either. People love to hate you, apparently.

I recently got my hands on the new Samsung Galaxy Buds 3, and I'm excited to share my thoughts. These sleek silver earbuds caught my eye with their open-type design. I was curious to see how they'd perform without the usual silicone tips.

After trying them out, I found the sound quality impressive. The bass is punchy, and voices come through crystal clear. I like that I can still hear what's going on around me while listening to music. It's great for staying aware when I'm out and about.

https://preview.redd.it/btow436dyh2e1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85290e4713d2159418955d9009dd7da2fe65d8d3

The active noise cancellation works well to block out unwanted noise. I tested it in a busy coffee shop, and it did a good job muffling the background chatter. The touch controls are handy for adjusting volume or skipping tracks without reaching for my phone.

One cool feature I tried is the real-time translator. It's neat for quick translations, though it's not perfect. The 360 audio is fun for watching movies, making me feel more immersed in the action.

Battery life seems solid. I've been using them for a few days without needing to charge. The case is compact and fits easily in my pocket.

The fit might be an issue for some. They stay in my ears fine, but I can see how they might not be secure for everyone. It's worth trying them on if you can before buying.

# Bottom Line

I'm happy with my Galaxy Buds 3. They sound great, have useful features, and look stylish. If you want earbuds that let you stay aware of your surroundings, these are worth checking out.



# Overview of SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds 3 AI

I recently tried out the new Galaxy Buds 3, and I have mixed feelings. These open-type earbuds let me stay aware of my surroundings, which is great for safety. The active noise cancellation works well to cut down unwanted noise. I like the personalized sound feature that adjusts based on how I wear them.

The translation and interpreter functions are neat ideas, but they didn't always work perfectly for me. The 360 Audio creates an immersive sound experience that I enjoyed while watching movies. Call quality is clear thanks to the wide-band speech technology.

Sadly, the fit isn't great for everyone. They kept falling out of my ears during exercise. The touch controls are finicky and took some getting used to. While the sound quality is good, it's not a huge leap from previous models.

These buds have some cool features, but the fit issues may be a dealbreaker for some users like me.

# All-New Open-Type Design

I really like the open-type fit of these Galaxy Buds 3. They don't have ear tips, which lets me stay aware of my surroundings. This is great when I'm walking around the city or working at my desk. I can hear my music clearly while still noticing if someone calls my name. The buds are comfortable for long wear too. I wore them for hours without any ear fatigue. One downside is that they might not block out as much noise as in-ear designs. But the active noise cancellation helps make up for this. Overall, the open design is a nice change from traditional earbuds.

I tried out the noise cancellation on these Galaxy Buds 3 and was impressed. They do a good job blocking out background sounds, letting me focus on my music or calls. It's not perfect - some noise still gets through, especially higher pitches. But overall it works well for everyday use. I like that I can turn it on and off easily with the touch controls. The open design means I stay aware of my surroundings even with ANC on, which is nice for safety. It's a solid feature that adds value, though folks wanting total silence might prefer in-ear buds instead.

# Adaptive Sound Optimization

I was impressed by the Galaxy Buds 3's adaptive sound features. The earbuds use AI to adjust the audio based on how they fit in my ears. This helped create a more personalized listening experience as I went about my day. Whether I was commuting to work or cooking dinner, the sound adapted nicely. The equalizer tweaks made music and podcasts clearer and more enjoyable. It's a smart feature that improves the overall audio quality. But keep in mind it only works with Galaxy devices. For non-Samsung users, this cool tech isn't available. Still, even without it, the Buds 3 produce good sound that most people will like.

# Cinematic Sound Experience

I was blown away by the immersive audio these buds deliver. The 360 Audio feature creates a personal theater-like experience, making me feel like I'm surrounded by sound. It's great for watching movies or TV shows at home. The boosted speaker produces rich bass and clear tones, bringing out details I hadn't noticed before. I can even play Ultra High Quality Audio with impressive sample rates. While the sound quality is top-notch, I found the fit a bit tricky. They sometimes rotate out of place during use, which can interrupt the cinematic experience. Still, when they stay put, the audio is truly impressive for such small earbuds.

# Ease of Connectivity and Sharing

Connecting these buds to my devices was a breeze. They paired quickly with my phone and laptop. I liked how easy it was to switch between devices without having to reconnect each time. The touch controls let me manage playback and calls right from the earbuds.

Sharing audio with friends is cool. We can connect multiple pairs of buds to one device for group listening. It's fun for quiet movie nights or sharing music. The Bluetooth range is good - I can walk around my home without losing connection.

One downside is the touch controls can be a bit touchy. I sometimes pause my music by accident when adjusting the fit. But overall, the connectivity features work well for everyday use.

# Pros and Cons

After using these Galaxy Buds 3 for a while, I've got some thoughts to share. They're not perfect, but they do have some strong points.

# Pros

* Great sound quality with deep bass
* Active noise cancellation works well
* Open design keeps you aware of surroundings
* Cool features like live translation and 360 audio
* Touch controls are handy
* Easy connection to Samsung devices

# Cons

* Fit issues for some users
* Can fall out easily during movement
* Touch controls can be finicky
* Translation feature isn't always effective
* Limited compatibility with non-Samsung phones

I found the sound to be really good, especially the bass. The active noise cancellation helped me focus when I needed to. I liked being able to hear what was going on around me with the open design.

The live translation seemed neat, but it didn't always work as well as I hoped. The 360 audio made movies more fun to watch. Touching the buds to control things was nice, though sometimes I accidentally changed things when adjusting them.

The biggest problem I had was keeping them in my ears. They stayed put when I was sitting still, but they'd slip out if I moved around too much. It seems like they fit some people great and others not at all.

For Samsung users, these buds connect fast and easy. If you use other phones, you might miss out on some features.

All in all, they're solid earbuds if they fit your ears well and you use a Samsung phone. But if they don't stay in or you want something for all devices, you might want to look at other options.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using these Galaxy Buds 3 for a while now, and I have mixed feelings. The sound quality is impressive, with clear audio and effective noise cancellation. I appreciate the quick connectivity and touch controls, though they can be a bit finicky at times.

The biggest issue I've noticed is the fit. For me, they stay in place well, but many users report problems with them falling out easily. This seems especially true for people with smaller ears. It's frustrating during activities or when you're on the go.

Some cool features like the real-time translator are neat ideas, but don't always work perfectly in practice. Battery life is solid, lasting through my workday without issue.

Overall, these buds have some great qualities, but the fit problems are a major drawback for many. If they sit comfortably in your ears, you'll likely enjoy them. But it's worth trying them on first if possible.

# Exclusive Offering and Warranty

I was pleased to find out that these Galaxy Buds come with a special Amazon deal. You get a 2-year limited warranty from Samsung, which is only available when you buy from Amazon. This extra year of coverage gives me more peace of mind about my purchase. It's nice to know that if anything goes wrong, I'm covered for longer than usual. This exclusive offering sets these Buds apart from other options and adds real value to the package.

# Conclusion

The Galaxy Buds 3 are a mixed bag. I liked the sound quality and noise cancellation, which were pretty good in my testing. The quick connection and touch controls worked well too. But the fit was a big problem. They kept falling out of my ears, especially during movement. This made me nervous about using them outside. The translator feature didn't work great either. While some users may find these buds comfortable, they weren't ideal for my ears. If you're considering these, try them on first if possible. The audio is solid, but comfort and stability are crucial for earbuds you'll wear daily.",1,1732300382.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

I recently got my hands on the Amazon Fire TV 75"" Omni QLED. This big-screen beauty has a lot to offer for TV lovers and tech fans alike.

The first thing that caught my eye was the stunning 4K display. The colors are rich and lifelike, making movies and shows pop off the screen. I was impressed by how well it handles bright and dark scenes, thanks to its local dimming feature. The TV also adjusts its brightness based on the room lighting, which is a nice touch.

https://preview.redd.it/9a5336u6yh2e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c4a0ea385b42a4a0844368af04a660d479383d3

I found the Fire TV interface easy to use, with access to tons of streaming options. The hands-free Alexa feature is handy for finding shows or adjusting settings without reaching for the remote. It's worth noting that the TV has built-in privacy controls, including a switch to turn off the microphones.

# Bottom Line

The Amazon Fire TV 75"" Omni QLED is a solid choice for anyone seeking a big, feature-packed smart TV. Its picture quality and smart features make it worth considering. 

# Amazon Fire TV 75"" Omni QLED Series Overview

I recently got my hands on the Fire TV 75"" Omni QLED, and I'm impressed. The picture quality is top-notch with its 4K Quantum Dot Display. Colors pop, and the HDR support makes scenes look lifelike. I like how it adjusts brightness based on my room's lighting.

The TV has some cool features. It can show artwork when not in use, which is neat. It also works with Alexa for hands-free control. I can ask it to turn on or find shows without reaching for the remote.

For connections, it has 4 HDMI ports. This is great for hooking up game consoles or a soundbar. The built-in speakers are okay, but I'd suggest adding external audio for better sound.

One thing to note: while it streams content well, some apps might need separate subscriptions. Overall, it's a solid TV with smart features that make watching easier and more enjoyable.

# Stunning 4K Quantum Dot Display

I was blown away by the picture quality on this TV. The 4K resolution is razor-sharp, making every detail pop. Quantum dot technology gives colors amazing vibrancy and depth. Blacks look inky dark thanks to the local dimming. HDR content really shines, with bright highlights and rich shadows.

The 75-inch screen size is perfect for my living room, creating an immersive viewing experience. Movies and shows look incredibly lifelike. Even in a bright room, the picture stays clear and vivid.

I love how the Fire TV Omni QLED adapts to different lighting conditions. The Dolby Vision IQ feature tweaks the picture to look its best whether I'm watching during the day or at night.

While the 60Hz refresh rate is fine for most content, fast-moving sports can look a bit blurry at times. But for movies and TV, the image quality is stellar.

# Advanced HDR

I was blown away by the HDR capabilities of this Fire TV. The Dolby Vision IQ and HDR10+ Adaptive really make scenes pop with rich, lifelike colors. Dark areas have deep blacks while bright highlights shine. I noticed the TV adjusts brightness based on my room lighting, which is a neat feature. The full array local dimming with 96 zones creates bold contrast. Whites look brighter and blacks look deeper compared to my old TV. Overall, the HDR performance brings movies and shows to life in a way that has to be seen to be believed.

# Adaptive Brightness Features

I was impressed by the Fire TV's adaptive brightness feature. It uses a built-in sensor to detect the lighting in my room and automatically adjusts the screen brightness. This made a big difference when watching movies in different lighting conditions. During the day, the TV boosted brightness to combat glare. At night, it dimmed to a comfortable level. I didn't have to mess with settings constantly. The TV did all the work to optimize picture quality as lighting changed. This smart feature enhanced my viewing experience and reduced eye strain.

# Full Array Local Dimming

I was impressed by the TV's full array local dimming feature. It uses 96 individual zones to control the backlight, creating deeper blacks and brighter whites. This enhances the contrast and makes images pop. I noticed improved shadow detail in dark scenes while watching movies. Bright objects in dark backgrounds had minimal blooming. The local dimming worked well with HDR content, bringing out highlights without washing out the rest of the image. It's not perfect - I saw some slight blooming around small bright objects occasionally. But overall, the feature significantly boosted picture quality compared to TVs without local dimming.

# Hands-Free TV with Alexa

I love being able to control my TV without searching for the remote. With this Fire TV, I simply say ""Alexa, turn on the TV"" or ""Alexa, play Stranger Things"" and it responds instantly. The built-in microphones pick up my voice clearly from across the room. I can adjust volume, change channels, and launch apps all by speaking.

While hands-free control is convenient, it's not perfect. Sometimes background noise interferes with voice commands. The TV also occasionally mishears me, especially for less common show titles. Still, I find myself using voice control more often than not.

One cool feature is pairing Echo speakers for better audio. I connected two Echo Dots for richer sound without extra wires. Overall, hands-free Alexa makes using this TV feel futuristic and effortless most of the time.

# Pros and Cons

After using this Fire TV for a while, I've gotten a good feel for its strengths and weaknesses. Here's what I found:

# Pros

* The 4K QLED display is stunning. Colors pop and look lifelike.
* HDR support is great. Dolby Vision IQ and HDR10+ Adaptive make scenes look amazing.
* Adaptive brightness works well, adjusting to my room lighting.
* Full array local dimming (96 zones) gives nice contrast.
* The Ambient Experience is cool for displaying art when not watching TV.
* Hands-free Alexa control is handy.
* Lots of streaming options available.

# Cons

* Built-in speakers are just okay. You'll want a soundbar for better audio.
* The Fire TV interface can feel a bit cluttered at times.
* Some users report occasional lag or slow response.
* Privacy concerns with built-in mics (though there is a disconnect switch).
* Price is higher than some comparable TVs.

I found the picture quality to be the standout feature. The QLED display with HDR support really makes content look amazing. Streaming was smooth, and I liked being able to control things with my voice. The Ambient Experience is a neat touch too.

On the downside, you'll want to budget for a soundbar to get the most out of this TV. And while the smart features are nice, the interface isn't always the snappiest.

For the price, I think it's a solid TV that will make most buyers happy, especially if you're already in the Amazon ecosystem. Just be aware of the audio limitations and occasional performance hiccups.

# Craftsmanship and Design

I'm really impressed with the build quality of this Fire TV. The 75-inch screen has a sleek gray metal finish that looks great in my living room. The bezel is super thin at just 1.2 mm, which makes the picture seem even bigger.

The TV feels solid and well-made. It weighs about 63.5 pounds without the stand, so it's sturdy but not too heavy to mount on a wall. The stand legs are spaced about 61 inches apart and keep the TV stable on my media console.

I like the clean, minimalist design. There are no buttons or logos cluttering up the front. All the ports are neatly arranged on the back panel. It has a nice mix of HDMI, USB, and Ethernet connections.

The built-in Alexa mics work well for hands-free control. There's also a physical switch to turn them off for privacy. Overall, Amazon did a great job with the look and build of this TV.

# Smart Home Integration

I found the Fire TV Omni QLED to be a great hub for my smart home devices. With Alexa built-in, I can control my lights, thermostat, and other compatible gadgets just by talking to my TV. It's really handy to check my security cameras or adjust the room temperature without reaching for my phone. The TV also works well with my Echo speakers for a wireless surround sound setup. I like how I can see Alexa widgets on screen, showing things like my smart home device status or calendar. While it's not perfect - sometimes Alexa mishears me - overall the smart features make my life easier.

# Privacy Features

I was impressed by the privacy protections built into this TV. It has a physical switch to electronically disconnect the microphones, which gave me peace of mind. This means I can easily turn off Alexa's listening ability when I want more privacy. The TV also gets regular software security updates for at least 4 years after it's last sold. This helps keep my data safe over time. While the hands-free Alexa features are useful, it's nice to have options to control my privacy when needed.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using this Fire TV for a few months now, and I'm impressed with its performance. The picture quality is stellar, with vibrant colors and deep blacks thanks to the QLED technology and local dimming. The 4K resolution really shines when streaming high-quality content.

Most buyers seem happy with their purchase, giving it a solid 4.1-star rating. Many praise the crisp image and user-friendly interface. The hands-free Alexa feature is a hit, making it easy to control the TV and smart home devices.

Some users noted occasional blooming issues, but it's not a deal-breaker for most. The built-in speakers are decent, but I'd recommend a soundbar for a more immersive experience.

While it's not perfect, the Fire TV Omni QLED offers great value for its price point. It's a solid choice for those wanting a feature-rich smart TV without breaking the bank.

# Conclusion

I'm really impressed with this Fire TV. The picture quality is top-notch, with QLED and local dimming delivering vivid colors and deep blacks. The Alexa integration is smooth, making it easy to control the TV hands-free. While the built-in audio is decent, I'd recommend a soundbar for the best experience. The Fire TV interface is user-friendly, though it can be a bit ad-heavy at times. Despite a few minor quirks, this TV offers great value for its price point. It's a solid choice for anyone looking for a large, feature-packed smart TV without breaking the bank.",1,1732300315.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

amazon is completely filled with copy/paste mdf cheapo wood and plastic nonsense, a thousand pages repeating the exact same models of tables and chairs and shelves with minute variations. overt lies in the descriptions (""made from solid wood!"") and in the reviews. absolutely garbage 90% of the time. edit: also is it just me or is the fake wood thing insane now?? literally every new building has it. my hairdresser got it installed. 80% of the homes for sale in the area have it for their flooring in that awful grey color. it's crazy how bad it looks.

ebay is a weird mix of all the above. boolean operators get rid of the dropshipping for me, but pricing and quality varies a lot and it can be tedious to sort through. i've found it much easier to buy vintage clothing on ebay than anything for the home.

etsy, despite being frequently overpriced, has been largely my best and most reliable source. despite dropshipping crowding the art and jewelry corners of the site, their furniture and home decor, especially if you're looking for bohemian or vintage shit, is largely untouched. i got a genuinely lovely rug from pakistan as well as a really nice coffee table and side table. i also got some (solid wood!) picture frames that look great.

do you guys have any sites or specific brand recs for furniture? i'm generally drawn to bohemian, mcm, and antique type stuff. i don't mind paying a little more if the quality's good.",7,1732300117.0,rs_x,2,0.89,False

\-Would prefer Fantasy, Space, or Post-Apocalyptic setting. I really dig RPG's / Dungeon Crawlers  
  
\-Would have to fit on a coffee table. Think Marvel Champions/Final Girl at the most.  
  
\-Not overly complex/thinky. No Spirit Island, Mage Knight, or Jaws of the Lion type stuff.   
  
\-I thought ODD would scratch the itch but found that I don't like that you just become more powerful after fighting something. I like to see artifact and armor upgrade cards (weird I know). It's why I love Munchkin or when I play Champions I'm drawn to upgrade or support cards (Iron Man). 

\-The closest thing I can find is Iron Helm. It looks to be up my alley but the poor instructions and spelling errors is such a turn off. I could probably get past it if the price was more reasonable. But since it's not, I decided to pass and wait for the next game he's making (cant remember the name).

What I offer: A whirlwind of chaos, laughter, and irony. A joyous journey through the dark tunnels of the human shell. A meticulous and strange deep dive into the messy mind that is not for the weak.

But also conversations about… coffee, books, art, travel. The reasons we hate small talk while actively engaging in it. The odd interactions with strangers at the grocery store or the clouded skies that hover around you. What is the life cycle of accomplishment, anyway?

You know. Usually.

I’m still working my way through all the recommendations, but so far, there hasn’t been a bad one in the bunch. Y’all know your coffee!

Now, since I’m here in NC, I feel like I can’t leave without diving into NC-style BBQ. A bit of background: I’m a So Cal native with Texas native mom, so BBQ purism runs deep in my veins (brisket or bust, right?). That said, I’ve given Memphis BBQ a fair shot and enjoyed it, so I’m ready to see what NC—or the Carolinas in general—has to offer.

In my research, I’ve noticed a few names that consistently pop up:

1. **Stamey’s Barbecue** – Seems like it has strong nostalgic ties for many, but I’m worried it might not live up to the hype in terms of flavor.
2. **Country BBQ** – Solid reputation for pork, but it doesn’t seem to get much buzz otherwise.
3. **Mac’s Speed Shop** – This one’s interesting. I’ve seen it highly rated on platforms like Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Google, but I don’t hear locals raving about it. Feels like it’s the outlier here.

Are these really the best options for NC BBQ? Or is there a hidden gem a bit farther out that I should try to experience BBQ nirvana?

I’m willing to make a drive if it means getting that unforgettable BBQ experience.

1gxegwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1gxegwq/doesnt_teaching_feel_rather_performative_at_times/,Doesn't teaching feel rather performative at times?,"I teach general English at a low-income high school in the Gulf Coast and sometimes I feel like this profession is one long con. The students get socially promoted through grades and are basically incapable of failing. If they do fail a course, they get credit recovery or night school, which is basically extremely basic remedial work where they can make up a year's class in a few weeks and all the work is essentially completion. Also, teachers that fail too many kids aren't seen as being ethical; they are seen as being a bad teacher not doing their job.

Our district has a ""no phone, earbud, hoodie"" policy that they trumpet to parents but, of course, there's no real consequence or true enforcement coming from the top down so it's left for teachers to enforce it as well as they can, which in high school means it's basically like pouring water out of the Titanic with a coffee cup.

Schools here celebrate that ""referrals are down"" and talk about how behavior is better but in reality, students only get any consequence for the most major of incidents (fights and drugs) and generally you have to go through about 20 steps as a teacher before a major referral gets accepted or enforced for anything less than that. Despite phones being banned, you really can't write students up for phone use. And, of course, as we all know, being a teacher that writes up a lot of students actually reflects poorly on the teacher because it reads as lack of classroom management as opposed to being someone holding the line.

Professional Developments meetings talk about bell-to-bell instruction and scaffolding and show us videos of perfectly cast classrooms with perfectly behaved students despite our day to day lives being nothing like that. We're given these model lesson plans that pivot from skill to skill that fit in about 8 things into a 50-minute class when in reality it takes about 15 minutes to get even a good class going on one activity and pivoting from activity to activity is just going to result in students being annoyed and them just checking out. Or we're told about effective small groups despite the fact that many of us spend our classes having to keep our eyes peeled that no one throws a chair or the five kids in the back don't start playing dice or play fighting or just being loud.

And yet we sit at faculty meetings and we nod our heads (""yes, call parents 12 times before a Dead will even deign to handle a problem,"" ""ah, yes try to work one on one with that troublesome student in my troublesome class of 30,"" ""ah, don't worry, kids will just do the work at home if they don't have enough time in class)"" and talk about these nonsensical ideas to improve behavior when in reality the best we can do is kick out the dead-end kids who have no hope of graduating and have an actual district enforced zero tolerance policy on these rules we're told.

It all just feels rather fraudulent. I don't know what this job is anymore. It's not really teaching. It's more management/supervision with occasional feedback for people who care. But yet we all pretend otherwise. We sit at meeting and use the pedagogical terms; the admin does walkthroughs and talk about engagement despite the kids not being engaged being on drugs or not having done any work since freshman year of 6th grade. And we do this for YEARS and YEARS with no pivot or change.

It seems a lot of our day is just managing behavior and assigning work (because keeping the gradebook updated  
and taking role is really the two most important things we do at this point). I wish this job required me to actually effectively teach, design lesson plans, engage in rigorous academic study and that students, no matter the level, were  
put in a position where they were held accountable and got the instruction they needed but those days are gone and they are never, ever coming back.

Anyway, hope everyone enjoy their Fall Break.

1gxefan,https://v.redd.it/cmy06s9jvh2e1,What does the Experienced say?,"I've had my Profitec Go for a week now. I went through the first bag of old coffee just to get the hang of it. Then I used a better and lighter roast for the next days, which got some good shots out of it until it was over. I felt confident that I had found the good grind spot for it.

Yesterday, I went back to a darker roast and it went downhill. I tried pulling 2 shots but after 10s of waiting, the water wouldn't go through. Today I tried to grind a little coarser and tamp it lighter. That's what I got in the video. It took 5sec for the coffee to start releasing, and it tasted bitter.
I've been trying the 1:2 ratio but decided to let it go a bit more just for the video purpose.

What am I missing? What should I do differently?",1,1732299423.0,espresso,7,0.67,False

So, I just casually decided to drop 140 pounds thanks to Mounjaro. Who knew all it took was a little magic shot to turn me into a walking, talking snack? 🍫💃 

Let me tell you, the transformation is *absolutely* real! I'm so hot now that my reflection keeps giving me compliments. Seriously, I have to fight off would-be lovers like I'm in an action movie. ""Back off, guys, I'm just trying to sip my iced coffee without someone proposing!""

But honestly, it’s tough being this fabulous! I've got so many admirers, I need a bodyguard just to grab groceries. The other day, I walked into a store, and the whole place went silent—you'd think I just starred in the hottest movie of the year! 🙌🔥 

So here I am, just trying to enjoy life when suddenly there’s a line of people ready to serenade me like I’m some kind of Greek goddess. Some even throw rose petals! 🌹

Honestly, I never signed up for this level of attention. Now, in maintenance, the toughest workout isn’t just hitting the gym; it’s trying to dodge all the compliments. Can someone send help before I trip over someone falling madly in love with me? 😂 

Anyway, here’s to Mounjaro and all the chaos it’s brought into my *stunningly good-looking* life! Stay fabulous, my friends! 💁‍♀️✨",0,1732299381.0,MounjaroMaintenance,7,0.37,False

The first month I was able to make 2 lattes for my wife and I consecutively, but just recently I have only been able to do 1. The first pull I get good espresso, the second one without changing any grind settings, coffee, etc. it struggles, and I get about 7 grams in 40 seconds. The 1st pull of espresso is about 35 grams of espresso in 25 seconds. Current grind setting is 5 on the inner burr, and outside it’s at 2. For pulling shots, the current setting is 10 seconds of pre infusion and 25 of extraction. I have light roast beans right now. BTW, I am using the steam wand after the 1st shot has been pulled.

Hello, informational thread ✨

Brief: I’m Kat, 30, but you’d never know it. Disney lover and aspiring nerd… introduce me to something new. I love to everyday cosplay. I’m a Kitty so I love wearing my ears to make sure you know who’s in charge around here.

I consider myself to be both an extreme domme and a nurturing domme. I don’t have many limits & I can do both. I’m very flexible with findom. This is your fantasy after all. 

I’m all in for the fun of humiliation within a session but outside the session I believe we’re both adults who can respect one another. 

Kink related: Hard limits- scat, urine, necrophilia, age, breath, blood 

Favorite Kinks: SPH, CEI, JOI, Key Holding, Ratings, Humiliation, Chastity, Orgasm Control, Praise, Micromanagement, Sissy, Public Humiliation, Tasks, Debt Contracts, Foot Worship, Cuckolding, Wallet Ownership, Human ATM

I use the stop light color system, Red, Yellow, Green, as safe words. 

Content: I don’t make content unless it is FEET content, don’t message me for nudes I don’t send those either. 

Payment Methods: Throne, Cash App, Buy me a Coffee 

My tribute is $50+, however I don’t make subs pay the tribute unless they want to continue after asking a few questions. 

Dream Sub: I am open to every sub except for my kink limit subs. However, I do like subs that I can have casual conversation with as it builds a connection if you decide you want me to be your long term domme. Preferably financially stable. 

My inbox is open to any questions that aren’t answered here ! ✨",1,1732299267.0,u_PrincessKatXoXo,0,1.0,False
