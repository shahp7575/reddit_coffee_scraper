1q7fxj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/kolkata/comments/1q7fxj8/the_industrial_scam_syndicate_a_masterclass_in/,The Industrial Scam Syndicate: A Masterclass in Industrial Intuition,"Note: Names have been changed to Vijay and Harshvardhan to protect identities. This is a true account of a high-stakes ""Bust-Out"" scam thwarted by industrial intuition.

The Bait:
It began with a cold lead that felt like a hot streak. A man named Vijay(Name Changed) reached out with a requirement that would make most manufacturers salivate: 43.5 Metric Tons of Virgin LDPE film. For a small unit, that’s a month of back-breaking labor. For my facility in Cossipore, it’s just a standard week’s production run.

I didn't know it yet, but I was being sized up as a mark.

The Set: 
Theatre in Sankrail
I drove to their ""unit"" in the Sankrail Industrial Park to finalize the deal. My suspicion began at the curb. The company’s nameplate wasn't metal or stone; it was a temporary flex board—the kind of signage you can rip down in five minutes and vanish.
Inside, the atmosphere was practiced. As I walked past a wooden partition into the employee bay, every head turned in a perfectly choreographed syncopation. They weren't working; they were watching. Suddenly, as if on cue, an employee began a loud, frantic phone call about ""HDPE granules"". It was a performance designed to make the room feel alive with trade.

The Inner Sanctum: 
I was led into the cabin to meet the ""Boss,"" Harshvardhan(Name Changed), and his ""Bauji"" (father). They played the role of an old-school industrial family, yet the props were all wrong. Harshvardhan was operating off a 2012 MacBook and a budget Oppo phone. His father tapped away at an ancient, battered HP laptop.

In a world where they claimed to move ₹8 Crores of plastics annually and call it a small part of their business, the tech was a decade out of date. Then came the coffee. It arrived in dirty, chipped, ancient cups. In the industrial culture of Kolkata, hospitality is a status symbol. Dirty cups aren't just a lapse in hygiene; they are the mark of a ""pop-up"" office with no permanent standards.

The Technical Duel:
They began to squeeze. They wanted credit—four weeks, then three. They claimed they were massive exporters to the USA.
I decided to run a ""Sting"" of my own. I leaned in and intentionally gave them blatantly wrong technical specifications for the material they supposedly needed for their high-end production lines. I waited for the MD to call my bluff. Instead, they nodded. They agreed. When I ""defended"" my fake specs with trick talk, they praised my expertise. They had no idea what they were buying. ### The Director Revealed.

The final mask fell when I asked about TReDS (bill discounting) to manage the cash flow. Harshvardhan looked blank—a supposed ""Big Exporter"" who didn't know the most basic financial tool in the Indian industrial sector.
Suddenly, the ""steward""—the peon who had served the dirty coffee—interrupted. He stepped out of his ""lower-class"" character and explained the financial concept to his own Boss in ""street hustle"" language: ""He's asking for cash if he gives a discount"". The steward wasn't the help; he was the director of the play.

The Escape:
I gave them nothing. No visiting card, no quotation, no samples. I kept my data locked in my bag like a weapon. As I called my driver to bring my car, I saw the steward outside, smoking. The moment he saw me on the phone, he panicked and rushed back inside to tell the ""actors"" the play was over or maybe he ran inside to alert them that i am calling someone.

The Final Twist: The Midnight Offer
I thought the game was over, but the scammers were desperate. I had locked the deal into a stalemate, refusing to budge on my terms: 50% Advance and 50% before dispatch.
The day after the meeting, Vijay called. He tried one last, desperate lure. He told me he could ""process the payment faster"" and bypassed the boss’s rigidity—if I gave him a personal ""cut"". He was trying to bribe me into a false sense of security, hoping the promise of a ""corrupt partner"" would convince me to finally release the material on credit.

The Aftermath:
I didn't bite. I pulled the final thread instead. I checked their GST number: zero filing history. No exports, no vendors, no history. Harshvardhan sent one last message: ""Suppliers already giving credit... why move to COD?"".

I didn't reply. You don't argue with a ghost. I didn't lose a deal that day; I saved Aman Plastics from a ₹1.5 Crore rolling debt trap.
The Moral: In business, if the order is in the millions but the coffee cups are dirty and the peon knows more about finance than the CEO—it's not a business. It's a stage play.

         Mira walks down the street in Seoul, her phone in her hand as she gives a sly grin to Zoey’s message, “Luvs u too pookie!” Looking up, Mira sees the apartment complex which is attached to the address her brother Jae gave her. She finds the fact that Jae lives with his family in an apartment and not some grand mansion, given their shared rich upbringing, very odd. Despite this, Mira reasons that, at the very least, Jae’s apartment must be large and lavish, perfectly accommodating for a family of virtually any size. Mira walks up the stairs to the third floor of the complex, eventually coming to a stop at Jae’s apartment door and knocking. After a few moments, Mira hears the unlocking of several deadbolt and latch locks, the door swinging open with a grungy woman in a slightly dirty bathrobe at the helm. Sounds of raucous commotion emanate from a fair distance inside the apartment behind the unkempt woman.

“Who are you?” the woman asks in a stern, matter of fact tone.

“I’m Mira Kwan,” answers Mira, tentative and now unsure if she has the right apartment, “is Jae Kwan here?”

“Mira!” shouts Jae’s voice from deep inside the flat. “Sorry! Hee, show her inside, please.”

“Yes, dear.” replies Hee, the woman in the bathrobe. Hee guides Mira inside, and what Mira sees completely shocks her. Jae’s apartment is a single bedroom flat, the living room consisting of a used convertible couch sofa, which Mira sees two little girls who she assumes are her nieces, maybe about nine or ten years old, sitting on and watching cartoons on a medium sized CRT TV propped up on a coffee table. Mira sees the kitchen Jae is laboring himself into, the area hardly more spacious than a prison cell. Several pans of hot, steaming food clutter the limited counter space, the kitchen practically turning into a makeshift sauna. The two girls look over to Mira, the slightly younger one greeting Mira with a chipper, “Hello!”

“Hey there,” Mira says with an awkward wave, the girls returning a wave of their own.

“Mira,” says Jae from the kitchen, a tinge of frenetic energy in his voice, “I should’ve remembered you were coming over earlier, I could’ve had dinner prepped and ready.”

Mira looks at the time on her phone, which reads a quarter past noon. “It’s a little early for dinner,” she says, “don’t you think?” Mira walks into the kitchen, the heat from all the cooking almost immediately flushing her skin red.

“Oh, no, this is just how I make food. I prepare around this time and then we eat what we can for lunch, then save what we can for later in the night.”

“If you two got this,” says Hee, pulling out a pack of Carnival Red cigarettes, “I’m gonna take a smoke.” Hee walks out the front door, slamming it shut as Jae says, “Sounds good, babe!”

“Here,” Mira says, reaching for a spatula to flip over steaks Jae has cooking on the stove, “let me help.”

“Don’t worry yourself,” says Jae insistingly, “I got the cooking part. If you wanna get plates out, that’d be great.”

Mira quickly flips over the steaks, having already been mid action, then looks up towards Jae’s visibly dusty cabinets above the stove. She opens all of them, only finding more jumbled together cooking utensils and half used paper towel rolls.

“Jae,” says Mira, “where’s your silverware cabinet?”

“It’s on the counter next to you.”

Mira looks over to her side to see a stack of value brand paper plates and plastic eating utensils, their contents still enveloped in half opened packaging. Mira internally sighs and grabs the plates, placing them down as Jae hovers over with piping hot pans of food. Jae scoops the heaps of hot, seasoned vegetables onto the plate, hurriedly placing the pans in the sink as he then jumps over to check on the steaks.

Throughout the relationship, she was very serious and often talked about wanting a future with me, including marriage. She said she only dates to marry, and I took that seriously as well I developed deep feelings for her.

She broke up with me after I recently started a new job following my college graduation. The stress from this transition really got to me and started to bleed into the relationship. I became more distant and irritable, not just with her but in other relationships too. I noticed this change in myself and started therapy to help manage it.

Before the breakup, she told me that for about a month she had been feeling lonely, unloved, and unseen, and that she wanted things to change. I listened, and we had a productive conversation about how to move forward. After that talk, things felt good.

Shortly after, an old female friend texted me, and my girlfriend asked who it was. I made the mistake of lying because I thought it would protect the progress we had just made. I later told her the truth that it was an old friend and nothing serious. She then privately messaged the girl, who told her that I had been semi-flirty. I can be overly nice and friendly at times, and I now understand how that could come across as flirting.

After that, she broke up with me. During the breakup, I told her I didn’t know if I could stay in contact because of how strongly I felt. She reacted very angrily to that.

Fast forward a month, and we are still in contact mostly casual conversations, sometimes deeper ones about family and the holidays. She tells me she misses me and loves me. Eventually, I told her I wanted to rekindle the relationship. She said that because of the distance, now wasn’t the right time, but that in five months when she finishes college and moves closer she would be open to it. She said she believes we could build something healthier and better then.

I should also mention that early on in our relationship, she hurt me badly in a similar way lying about specific guys and who they really were.

Later, we had another conversation where I told her that I didn’t want to be an option or wait around for five months living on false hope, and I asked if distance was truly the only issue. She then admitted that she’s scared I won’t change, that she’ll take me back, and everything will fall apart again. She also said she wants to enjoy her last five months with her friends and roommates. Part of her felt pressure when she went out with friends because she worried about how I would react. She mentioned one incident where she went to grab coffee with a girlfriend, and I was texting her so much that she felt she had to end the get-together early.

Now I feel stuck in limbo. I’m confused and hurt, and I don’t know where things truly stand. Do you think there is still a real chance for us, considering I still want to be with her?",0,1767888699.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

Vaughn has earned my trust in his recipes many times over and this one, for me personally, is something special. It's a very unique combination of a familiar flavor with a texture that puts it almost in its own category. 

High hydration, yeasted dough with a dense cake-like texture, just sweet enough to pair well with the crispy brown sugar and cinnamon topping. Calling it coffee cake or bread or even quick bread seems reductive compared to what comes out of that pan.

I'll be honest, the texture may not be for everyone - but I'm on my third pan this week and it's only Thursday. It's real good. No subs, no notes, do as Vaughn does and the results will be great. My best description of it, and I mean this in only positive way, is like biting into a delicate, sweet latex foam pillow 😅 Are there other desserts like this?

But that story ignores a reality of why men traditionally court and put effort into dating women, because it produces better results. 

Men and women tend to get horny differently. When men are bored, sex *is* the entertainment. For women, they generally need to already be having fun before they want to have sex. That's why coffee dates are often criticized over dinner and drinks--not just because its low effort,  Its just harder to feel sexual feelings towards someone after coffee than in a well lit chic restaurant with drinks flowing. 

This is also why the whole “why do I have to plan everything?” complaint misses the point. you’re doing it because being fun to be around makes women more open to you sexually in the first place. That’s the tradeoff men used to understand intuitively.

And yeah, you can insist on 50/50, low effort, no courting, no paying, no leading. You’re totally allowed to do that, it’s just harder to pull off if you actually want results.

There’s a reason less partying, less going out, and more homebody dating has coincided with less sex and fewer relationships. Removing fun from the equation removes a lot of what is fun about dating for women, which in turn makes them less interested in dating.

Since 16/17 or so, I have been very addicted to caffeine (mainly coffee) and nicotine (vaping). My life 'on' those things was pretty great, very focused at work, tons of energy to socialize, made time for my physically demanding hobbies, and in general high vitality.

I am 26 now and decided to quit those habits for my own health; that said every time I kicked them my withdrawal symptoms were extremely bad, could barely function. I got Wellbutrin from a doctor, and it was magic, was able to quit both with no withdrawals. I have to admit my 4-6 weeks on it was really good, my life brightened up.

I quit the Wellbutrin about 2 months ago and have been nicotine/caffeine free since but the urges are slowly creeping back. I notice that I have zero drive for anything that I once did - work, my side business, my hobbies, hanging out with my friends, dating. I find myself literally able to just sit on the couch and do nothing for multiple hours which has never happened to me. I just literally have no energy.

This is...probably weird to share but I have tried certain rec drugs and felt zero effect from them too. The times I actually feel amazing and myself again is after a night of heavy drinking with my mates but I believe this may be due to the social contact and endorphins of just having fun lol.

I will admit the one big upside of being fully free from stimulants is my sleep is consistently amazing with vivid dreams and I am way way more calm & chill, life moves a bit slower in general for me now.",1,1767888403.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

We were assigned to the same group for a project. We spent twelve weeks getting super close, there was a lot of sexual tension and chemistry. So I eventually asked her out to coffee and she told me she had a boyfriend. I was like cool I respect that so I pulled away.

Then after I pulled away she started acting weird, almost sabotaged our group project and did some other things i won't mention here. 

I was pretty sure she lied about the boyfriend but I never pushed.

I went home for summer, went out with others just focused on my life. Then I get back to campus and this is where the weirdness starts. I'm usually very private on socials but I kept getting fakes adding me almost weekly. I ignored them at first but I'll get back to this in a bit

We ended up in the same class again, and that's where this weirdness really took off. She noticed me and immediately began flirting again. I sensed she was trying to reset things and sweep it up der the rug so I didn't play along. We had a brief text exchange about last semester and I told her straight up that I didn't regret what happened and that there was no hard feelings. 

So after that text was sent she started skipping classes, once I said hi while walking past her desk and her legs shook uncontrollably for the entire class. She runs away when we get close to each other physically like if we are in the same space.

I've only talked to her twice the entire last semester and never texted her. I just keep to myself and that's when I notice her constantly checking me out. I was also getting close to another girl Kim and she kind of sabotaged that connection.

Kim told me that Ash mentioned that I was not available to date. This came up because Kim and I were getting close and she suddenly backed off so I confronted Kim about this. Kim basically said Ash told her to back off from me and she did because they do know each other. 

Kim also told me that she saw Ash snooping into my socials during another class they shared together and that's kind of how I linked the fakes back to her. There is another reason why I knew the fakes were her but yeah.

So the general advice is ignore get on with your life but everyone in our class notices the weirdness including the professor. We just started a new semester and she pulled the same run away thing again. 

I know the normal thing to do is to talk like adults but she seems incapable of a simple chat. She runs away instead and I don't know what to do.

I asked her if we were good, she said yes months ago then keeps running ejich is opposite of we are good.

I'm 5'0 and currently 125 lbs. Last year I went from 145 to 125 with CICO and exercise. My goal was 115 lbs but I never got there as I got a new job and moved and it was just a big period of adjustment.

Now I'm ready to start again and try to get down to 110-115 lbs, but I'm having a lot more trouble losing the weight. My activity level is as follows: 10-12K steps/day, bike 30 minutes (15 mins to and from work) x 5 days a week, and exercise 45 mins (HIIT or strength training) 4-5x per week. 

I am unsure if this qualifies as moderate or heavy activity. If moderate, my tdee is 1880 and if heavy it is 2093 cals/day. 

With my new job I'm off on the weekends most of the time and I find myself indulging in a cup of coffee, a meal out (where I am still conscious) or a glass of wine. This puts me at closer to maintenance on the weekends and the weight isn't coming off as easily as before. 

I'm currently eating 1350 cals/day on the weekday and about 1800 on the weekends. Is it worth cutting weekday calories down to 1200-1250 even if it makes me feel hungry? Or should I just accept slower weight loss? I'm finding it challenging to avoid social obligations on the weekend and realistically probably won't make a ton of sustainable change there right now.

I wanted to share mine which I consider largely positive.

First, I underestimated how limited I would be in terms of ache. The surgery impacts a lot of muscles in particularly around the belly button, and that alone makes it hard to even sit at  a computer for very long.  I thought I would be able to do computer work for my job at least and I was wrong.  I find I need to lay down even after sitting at a chair for awhile.

I was at the tail end of a cough before surgery, and surgery definitely exacerbated my throat irritation a bit more, and the coughing and clearing throat has added additional ache to belly.

I emphasize this part above mostly as a warning to people who work from home, the belly pain is no small thing.  If people are reading this who have a better timeline on belly muscle usage, i'd appreciate them giving a timeline.

\------------

The most surprisingly good thing to me has been my ability to eat food after this surgery.  I was given cheese, crackers, muffins coming out of surgery, and I have continued largely on a conservative version of my normal diet.  I've been doing well with coffee, mozzarella cheese, milk, small amounts of butter, chicken.  I've had zero diarrhea.

I'm being hesitant at calling this the end of my changes to my digestive system, I'm expecting i'll find some trigger and max limit, but i'm grateful and surprised i'm not on some spartan diet.

In all honesty: I should probably be eating how I am as a norm of life!

As per meds, I've been able to manage pain with largely just off the shelf medicines as per my doctors advice.  I agree with what i've been told that it's been super important to be regular and consistent about taking them. I expect to wean off of them even more after today to just one as per doctor suggestion.

Constipation hasn't been an issue, as I took some advice to begin a stool softener pills asap.

\-----------

The biggest benefit by far is just not feeling anything in gallbladder area. It's just total emptiness now when eating which is great.  No more worrying about ER trips.

Now i'm just focused on guarding belly muscles, keeping on walking, and being grateful for a stable digestive system in transition.",1,1767888076.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

And I forgot how bananas advantageous it is. 

I've had time to get everything together for the day's classes, straighten up my classroom, lay out supplies, write my objectives (super important, I guess), brew some coffee, enjoy said coffee, and write a drivel-y reddit post. And, unlike having a plan period later in the day, I have the energy and motivation to do it all.

Yes, I fully realize that psychologically well-adjusted adults can get these things done independent of when their plan occurs in the workday. Apparently, that requires a degree of executive functioning on which I'm still working. I was the student who always got my work done right before it was due, and not an hour earlier. And, because it always worked out, those habitual patterns were set. 

As a result, this first period plan just works for me. Having a plan later in the day just doesn't carry with it that sense of urgency enough to adequately motivate me. Mental note: I'll need to work on that - but, next semester. Because right now, I'm loving this first period plan.

All of them had high booth fees, sure, but not one of them was $2,500. And every single one offered perks: free coffee, donuts, water, lunch—something that showed they valued the artists. They gave us nothing, not even the cute bag the customers get.

This event packed in over 600 vendors, and while I originally thought being accepted meant they loved my designs and the show was fully juried, I found out they were still letting people apply the week before. That was disappointing, to say the least. They do not value the artists, they value the money they get from the artists booth fees.

I did well with the customers who actually made it back to the very last row—those who found me truly appreciated my work. Their comments were exactly what I hoped for. But here’s my honest question for those who do this show every year: why?

There’s simply no way to justify a $2,500 booth fee plus additional expenses like parking, hotel, food costs.

So I’m left wondering… is this show more about status than sales? A “Look, I’m in the One of a Kind Show!” kind of thing? Because from my experience, I’m honestly embarrassed to have done it. But I did walk away with a valuable lesson: I will never do this show again! It felt like an organized, somehow legal scam. There is so much more I can go into in full detail about this event but just know, it was not worth it!

I'll start off by saying that I am a V60 loyalist. I have used a V60 for a majority of the 12 years that I have been in this coffee rabbit hole. Kalita Wave is a close second, that I also love very dearly. Aside from that, I have tried and brewed with nearly every brewer out there. Unless it's obscure or not readily available, I have owned or tried.

The pulsar mini is, in my opinion, the best coffee brewer on the market and it's not particularly close. The level of coffee that comes out of this brewer truly is mind blowing. It takes little to no effort to produce nearly perfect coffee, with no ""dialing in"". I haven't changed my grind size or recipe on a single coffee that I have tried. The only variables I have changed is my ratio and temp on the funkier stuff, which so far has worked on the two ""funkier"" coffees I have tried. I don't even like heavily processed coffee, I only purchased to test out on this brewer, and I have enjoyed every single cup.

I use basically do the Rao/Gagne recipe with no wet wdt, just a little swirl in the beginning and end. 1 min bloom. TDT of 4-5 min. I really use the valve to achieve that rough drawdown time, it is never fully open, usually somewhere between 1-2 o'clock. Coffee still tastes good at the 3:30 and good even up to 6 min. I can't stress enough how hard it is to fuck up your brew on this.

I have the regular pulsar but went back to ol faithful (V60 01) because I just didn't love the cups I got with 15g, I don't like brewing 25g cups for myself, and the cleaning was a bit of a pain.

  
They alleviated all of that with this brewer. 15g is my personal sweet spot, I have found that doses as small as 10g and as high as 20g are great too. Cleaning is a breeze, maybe not as easy as a V60 but it's damn close. If the valve is open and you pull the chamber off from the base at and angle, the puck comes out cleanly every time. Quick rinse then done.

If you struggle with making pourover and often get frustrated about not getting the results you want, get a pulsar mini. If you want something that is reliable and makes the same quality of cup every time, get a pulsar mini. If you want to stop stressing over every small variable/mistake, get a pulsar mini.

I can clearly see reality TV shows based on Pakistani truck drivers, someone running a coffee shop, relationship based ones where OSPs come in to get married, a family with 8 sons and 8 bahus, etc etc. Sky is the limit with the scenarios that can happen in Pakistan.

1q7f5n1,https://i.redd.it/hbvtosz0c5cg1.jpeg,"Intersting autograph set, and family heirloom, from 1974","On August 12th 1974, my grandfather and my two uncles were headed back to Chicago from a trip to the Adirondack Mountains. Whether by chance, or my Grandpas guidance, they pulled over to spend the night in Cooperstown, NY. My Grandpa (RIP) always figured himself a bit of a big shot, so he attempted to get a room at the nicest hotel in town, the Otesaga Hotel.

He was told at the desk that, due to the 1974 Hall of Fame inductions and game that had occurred that day, they were fully booked, save one suite that was a last minute cancel. So he took it for him and his sons. 

That evening, they went down to the dining room for dinner, and found themselves surrounded by Hall of Fame players doing the same, after attending the induction and game that day. My youngest uncle was 12 years old, and grabbed the only thing he had, his menu (which is helpfully dated), and went around gathering autographs. 

This is who signed his menu, starting in the upper right and going clockwise:


Warren Spahn: 1942 to 1965, HOF 1973

Whitey Ford: 1950 to 1967, HOF 1974 (earlier that day) 

Rube Marquard: 1908 to 1925, HOF 1971 (Rube attempted to sign on the bottom left, however my uncle said his hand was too shaky, so he gave up, and handed him a pre-autographed card at the suggestion of his wife, which is in the bottom right of the frame) 

George Giles: 1927 to 1938, a Negro League player, all-star, and manager

Joe Medwick: 1932 to 1948, HOF 1968

Stan Musial: 1941 to 1963, HOF 1969

Stan Coveleski: 1912 to 1928, HOF 1969

Casey Stengel: 1912 to 1925, HOF 1966 as a manager


One last bit of trivia from the story. Notably absent is Mickey Mantle, who was inducted famously that day beside Whitey. Supposedly after the induction, he had to leave town for a family emergency, and that is whose suite my Grandfather was able to book and use. I’m told this info was provided by the front desk.

Apologies the photo isn’t 10/10, it was provided by my uncle, and the menu is still in his possession.

When I was called with my test results, they(the nurse) just told me “cut out beef and pork”. Thankfully I did my own research. I cut out everything, and waited for yesterday’s appointment with very low hopes since the phone call was very vague. Not only was my doctor extremely knowledgeable, she listened to me. I told her I thought a dry cough I had one morning/afternoon was an allergic reaction, and she agreed. I expressed how I was concerned that my reactions are getting worse(I usually just rash up), and how it makes myself and my husband nervous for me to be at home alone with the kids and me possibly go into anaphylaxis. She prescribed an EpiPen. We discussed foods, her experience with patients who have done acupuncture, and how it won’t always be THIS bad. I’m just in the thick of it. We discussed talking to the pharmacist about my meds I’m already on to make sure they’re safe. When I talked to the pharmacist, she was very kind and knowledgeable, and told me I couldn’t take one of my meds due to its ingredients(which I had already stopped). I was just extremely happy with how everything went. 

To top it all off, I’ve not had my fav local coffee shop since being diagnosed. I went in yesterday, explained I had an allergy and needed to know/check ingredients, along with no cross contamination. They were so helpful and fixed my favorite drink to be AGS safe and I didn’t have any reactions! 🥹❤️ 

This diagnosis has been a bummer and I’m realizing that just being heard when it comes to it makes a big impact. My husband has gone above and beyond to make sure I don’t have a reaction. My mother on the other hand doesn’t think AGS exists because she’s never heard of it and doesn’t care to educate herself which just upsets me when I’m telling her I can’t eat something. 

I’m so glad I have support where it counts to make this transition to the Alpha Gal lifestyle as easy as possible. ",5,1767887073.0,alphagal,0,1.0,False

I feel like in 3rd and 4th wave coffee culture, light roasts have become a bit of a fad. Coffee people (ugh, I’m one of them.

Sometimes, if done as just a shot, it can be alright, in the same way a floral tea is alright.

However, when coffee places and coffee people start defaulting to light roasts in \*lattes\*, they’ve gone too far! Light roasts get absolutely lost in a latte. It turns into a hot fruit smoothie with milk at that point. If I want a latte, I want the espresso to be \*bold\*. I want it to have that strong nutty dark chocolate punch that \*cuts through\* the milk! Please, please, if you like light roasts, fine, but keep that away from my latte.

Sophia Collins was Nordhaven's renowned top surgeon—her hands are insured for over ten million dollars. Those golden hands are a priceless national treasure!

Yet at this moment, her hands were being stomped on the ground down with force.

And the culprit was none other than her husband, the man at the top of Nordhaven's hierarchy: Aiden Blackwood.

Aiden just sat there quietly on a stool, impeccably dressed, his expression calm as ever.

On the large screen behind him, Sophia's sister was being dragged into a dim room by several strong men. Her sister's broken, helpless cries echoed out, wrenching Sophia's very heart.

""Sophia, either you operate on Isabella Vance's mother, or I'll spread these videos all over Nordhaven tomorrow!""

Sophia gritted her teeth, her eyes bloodshot as she stared at Aiden.

""Aiden, why are you doing this to me?""

""You know perfectly well it was Isabella who ran over and killed my mother!

Now her mother has a brain tumor, and that's just karma, yet you're forcing me to operate on my enemy?""

A month ago, Sophia's mother was out early to buy groceries when she was hit and killed by a drunk-driving Isabella.

She immediately took her to court.

But, in less than three days, someone else came forward to take the fall.

Seeing the real killer walk free, Sophia couldn't accept the outcome. She took the case to court again, only to be repeatedly rejected. Even her professorship was revoked by the hospital, followed by an indefinite suspension.

Just as she was despairing, Isabella's mother fell ill.

Because of the dangerous location of her tumor, no one in the entire city dared to take on the surgery except for Sophia.

Sophia's first reaction to the news was to refuse. The thought of operating on a murderer's mother was more agonizing to her than death itself.

But the next second, she found herself tied up in a basement.

It wasn't until she saw Aiden that she understood: her husband, who on the surface loved her more than life itself, had always held another person deep in his heart.

""Sophia, you're running out of time!""

Aiden's voice pulled Sophia back from her thoughts.

""I'll give you three more minutes. If you still refuse to operate on Isabella's mother, then I'll have no choice but to hit the 'go live' button and let all of Nordhaven, even the entire country, watch this little group film starring your sister!""

Her sister's heart-wrenching cries for help were like sharp arrows, piercing through Sophia's body and filling her with unbearable pain.

Sophia clenched her fists tightly, the metallic taste of blood filling her mouth. ""Aiden, have you forgotten the promise you made when you married me?""

On their wedding day, Aiden had knelt before Sophia and solemnly promised her: ""Sophia, from this day forward, your family is my family. I will protect them forever.""

Aiden acted as if he hadn't heard Sophia's hoarse voice, his gaze icy and indifferent.

""Sophia, one last minute. Your sister's fate is in your hands!""

The light in Sophia's eyes dimmed in that instant, leaving only despair. She gritted her teeth and, with a heart like dead ashes, uttered the words that would satisfy Aiden.

""I agree to operate on Isabella's mother.""

Hearing Sophia's answer, Aiden ruffled her hair, satisfied.

""Good girl.

When the surgery is over, I'll give you a villa as compensation!""

Looking at the smile on Aiden's face, Sophia found it incredibly ironic.

She was quickly sent into the operating room. The tumor removal surgery took a full twelve hours to complete.

Exhausted, Sophia walked out of the operating room. Before she could even catch her breath, her phone rang.

It was a call from her friend.

""Sophia, something's happened! A video of your sister being raped was live-streamed, and she can't handle the shock. She's about to jump off a building.""

With a clatter, Sophia's phone fell to the floor. She stumbled out, her voice trembling as she ran.

""How could this happen? Aiden, you promised me! You promised you'd leave Henrietta alone if I had the surgery.""

Sophia arrived at the rooftop. The fire department was already there. Her sister sat quietly on the ledge, like a broken porcelain doll.

Sophia looked at her sister in terror: ""Henrietta, your sister is here. Please don't do anything foolish, okay?

Everything will pass. Please, trust your sister, okay?""

Her sister slowly turned her head, and the moment she saw Sophia, a faint smile appeared: ""Sister, you're here!""

Sophia slowly walked forward.

""Henrietta, come down!

I'm begging you as your sister!

I can't lose you too!""

Henrietta's eyes were empty, her face devoid of any will to live.

""Sister, I'm sorry!

But I really don't have the courage to go on living!""

With that, her sister slowly stood up, a faint smile on her face as she looked at Sophia:

""Sister, I'm going to join Mom now!""

As the words fell, her sister leaned back without a moment's hesitation.

Sophia lunged forward like a madwoman, but her hands grasped at nothing.

""No, Henrietta, no!""

In an instant, all the firefighters rushed over, holding Sophia back with all their might.

Sophia struggled with all her might.

""Let me go! I have nothing left! I have no family anymore!""

Sophia felt her heart ache as if it were about to burst. Then, a mouthful of blood surged up, and her vision instantly faded to black.

When she woke again, the smell of hand sanitizer filled her nostrils. Sophia sat up like a walking corpse.

Then, she dialed a number that had lain dormant for five years.

""I accept your terms. I have only one condition: I want Aiden and Isabella to pay the price they deserve!""

There was a long silence on the other end of the line, followed by a deep voice.

""No problem. I'll come to pick you up in person in a month.""

After hanging up, Sophia sent a message to her lawyer.

\[Prepare a divorce decree for me immediately!\]

Chapter 2

Chapter 2

Just as the message was sent, the door to her hospital room was forcefully pushed open.

Before Sophia could see who it was, she was pulled into a familiar embrace.

""Sophia, I'm so sorry about your sister, but it was an accident. The equipment malfunctioned.""

Aiden's gentle voice sounded by her ear, but it only made Sophia feel utterly disgusted.

She pushed Aiden away, her face expressionless. The love in her eyes was long gone, replaced only by endless hatred.

Sensing Sophia's coldness, Aiden took her hand, his eyes full of tenderness, as if nothing had happened.

""Sophia, didn't you want your position back?

""I've already notified the hospital, and I'll even get you that professorship you've always wanted, okay?""

Sophia let out a cold laugh, shaking off Aiden's hand.

""Is this your idea of compensation?

Compensation bought with the lives of my mother and my sister?""

Sophia had never imagined they would one day end up like this.

Back then, when Aiden was ambushed, a bullet lodged between his ribs, and no surgeon in Nordhaven dared to perform the surgery.

It was she who stepped forward without hesitation. Under immense pressure, she successfully saved Aiden, and from that moment on, captured his heart.

From then on, Aiden began to pursue Sophia relentlessly, showering her with enough flowers and jewelry to fill a castle. He even transferred fifty percent of his company shares into her name before they were married, giving her a profound sense of security.

Everyone said Sophia was the luckiest person in Nordhaven, and for a time, she believed it too.

It wasn't until Aiden's first love returned to the country, and she saw Isabella's face—a face that bore a striking resemblance to her own—that she finally understood.

She was nothing more than a pitiful substitute.

Just then, a lawyer suddenly walked in holding a document, pulling Sophia from her thoughts.

The moment Aiden saw the lawyer, his face darkened, and a sinister glint flashed in his eyes as he looked at Sophia.

""You still haven't given up, have you?

You're actually thinking of suing Isabella?""

Sophia took the divorce agreement from the lawyer's hands and looked at Aiden with a mocking expression.

""Didn't you say you were going to compensate me with a villa?

Sign it!""

Hearing that she was only demanding compensation, Aiden breathed a sigh of relief. Just as he was about to open the document to look it over, the hospital room door was pushed open again.

Isabella rushed in, a panicked look on her face.

""Aiden, my mother suddenly says her chest hurts terribly. Did something go wrong with the surgery?""

Aiden's gaze darkened as he gripped Sophia's wrist tightly.

""Didn't you say the surgery on Isabella's mother was a success?

Why is this happening?

What exactly did you do?""

Sophia looked at Aiden's anxious expression, and the memory of his cold indifference on the day her own mother died made it all feel incredibly ironic.

""Post-operative complications are common!""

Isabella looked at Sophia desperately.

""Miss Collins, I know you don't like me. Please, direct all your resentment at me, okay?

I'm begging you, don't do anything to my mother!""

Aiden stared darkly at Sophia: ""Go and treat Isabella's mother right now. If anything else goes wrong, Sophia, you know what I'm capable of!""

But Sophia just looked coldly at the document in Aiden's hand.

""Sign it!

I'll go as soon as you do!""

Aiden looked at her, his expression sinister.

""Sophia, are you threatening me?""

""Aiden, this is what you owe me!""

Sophia's voice was icy, yet held a broken quality.

Aiden froze for a moment, then stepped forward and quickly signed his name.

""Are you satisfied now?""

Sophia took the signed divorce agreement and immediately handed it to the lawyer standing by her side.

""Get it done as soon as possible!""

The lawyer hurriedly placed the divorce agreement into his briefcase and nodded at Sophia.

""Miss Collins, the entire process can be completed in just thirty days!""

Watching Sophia speak with the lawyer, Aiden felt a strange flutter of panic and a faint, unsettling feeling.

After seeing the lawyer off, Sophia followed Isabella to the special care unit. The moment she stepped inside, a vase came flying violently at her forehead.

Chapter 3

Chapter 3

The vase shattered on the floor, and blood slowly trickled down Sophia's forehead.

Isabella's mother glared at her, her face contorted with rage.

""You little bitch, did you do something to me during the surgery?

Why does my chest hurt so much?""

Sophia clenched her fists tightly, her gaze cold as she stared at the woman in the bed.

The person she had spent twelve hours operating on, the person she had saved at the cost of losing her own sister, had woken up only to accuse her.

""Pain after surgery is completely normal. Since you still have the energy to yell, I'd say you're recovering just fine!""

As Sophia turned to leave, Isabella blocked her path.

""Miss Collins, if you don't check on my mother, I'm afraid it will be hard to explain to Aiden!""

Sophia didn't want to cause any more trouble before the divorce was finalized.

Suppressing the rage in her heart, she walked to the bedside. Just as she took out her stethoscope, Isabella's mother suddenly raised her hand and slapped Sophia across the face.

""Do you even know how to be a doctor?

Are you just trying to fob me off with a stethoscope?""

Sophia clutched her swollen cheek, her face filled with fury as she stared at the woman in the bed.

""Mrs. Vance, if you question my abilities, you can request a different doctor. But your repeated assaults have caused me physical harm.""

The words had barely left her mouth when another sharp 'smack' echoed.

Isabella's mother slapped her again.

""So what if I hit you?

Are you going to sue me or something?

Have you forgotten how your sister died?

Maybe next time, you'll be the one broadcast live to the world!""

Isabella's mother looked at Sophia with a triumphant smirk.

""I guess that fits right in with your family. Your mother was a scam artist who deserved to get hit by that car and die. And your sister is a shameless slut who sells herself out!!

So I imagine you're no good either!""

Hearing the very person responsible for her mother's and sister's deaths insult them, Sophia snapped and lunged, her hands wrapping around Isabella's mother's throat.

""You're the ones who killed them! What right do you have to insult them?!

I can save your life, and I can just as easily send you to hell!""

As soon as the words were out, a powerful force suddenly shoved her away. She slammed into the bedside cabinet, and an excruciating pain shot through her entire body.

Aiden stood in front of the hospital bed, shielding Isabella and her mother behind him, his expression one of disgust as he looked at her.

""Sophia, I thought you would have changed after what happened to your sister. I never expected you to become even worse, attacking a patient!

You are such a profound disappointment!""

Isabella threw herself into Aiden's arms, sobbing pitifully.

""Aiden, I don't know why Miss Collins suddenly went crazy, but my mother just had a major surgery. Her body can't take this kind of abuse!""

Aiden looked at the teary-eyed Isabella, his heart aching for her. He immediately pulled her into a tight embrace and glared coldly at Sophia.

""Sophia, apologize!""

Sophia clenched her fists, fighting to keep the tears from falling as she stared defiantly at Aiden.

""Why should I apologize?

Why should I apologize to the people who killed my family?""

Aiden watched Sophia with a dark expression, then gave a slight lift of his hand to the bodyguards behind him.

""Since my wife refuses to apologize, take her to the the family chapel to kneel. Don't let her out until she admits she was wrong.""

Hearing the words ""the family chapel,"" Sophia's pupils constricted.

The family chapel was a forbidden place for the Blackwood family. Aiden kept two Mastiffs there as guards.

The Mastiffs were incredibly fierce, and several people were bitten by them each year.

Sophia looked at Aiden in terror.

""Aiden, you can't send me to the family chapel!""

But Aiden didn't even spare her a glance.

Sophia was practically dragged to the family chapel.

The moment she entered, the two Mastiffs—starving like demons—fixed their eerie green eyes on Sophia.

Sophia turned to run, but the bodyguards shut the heavy doors of the family chapel without hesitation.

""Aiden, you can't do this to me! I can't stay in here, I'll die!""

The wound on Sophia's forehead hadn't been treated, and the scent of blood lingered. The instant the two dogs caught the smell, they lunged.

One dog clamped its jaws tightly around Sophia's right hand, while the other pinned her down, making it impossible for her to move. The Mastiff's weight of over 180 pounds nearly crushed the air from her lungs.

Enduring the pain, she fumbled for her phone and called Aiden.

The phone rang for a long time before it was answered.

""Aiden, save me!

The dogs have gone crazy!""

Aiden was stunned on the other end of the line, but before he could speak, Isabella's voice came through.

""Aiden, I remember how obedient those two dogs were when I gave them to you!

How could they possibly hurt anyone!""

Hearing Isabella say this, Aiden's voice grew cold.

""Sophia, stop playing games. I'll let you out when you realize you were wrong.""

Hearing Aiden's resolute words, Sophia felt as if she had been plunged into an icy abyss.

So, in his eyes, even her cry for help was just a manipulative trick.

A sharp crack cut through the air as the mastiff's teeth found her wrist. An excruciating, tearing pain ripped through her, so severe it brought a wave of nausea and near unconsciousness. The agony was absolute—it had stolen her voice, leaving her unable to even whimper.

Crimson blood flowed endlessly as Sophia's consciousness began to fade.

Before she passed out, she saw Aiden bursting in as if possessed, gathering her into his arms in a crushing embrace that defied the world.

""Sophia, I'm sorry!""

Chapter 4

Chapter 4

When she woke up again, Sophia found herself in a familiar hospital room.

An excruciating pain shot through her hand, and Sophia realized she couldn't lift it at all.

She sat up in a panic. Her right hand was nothing but pain; she couldn't exert any strength with it.

""How could this happen?""

Large tears streamed down Sophia's face. Panicked and helpless, she tried to get out of bed. Hearing the movement, Aiden immediately rushed over from the sofa and pulled her into a pained embrace.

""Sophia, I'm so sorry. The Mastiff severed the tendons in your hand... you won't be able to hold a scalpel anymore!""

Sophia stared down at her hand, her mouth opening and closing, but no words came out.

Her hand, the one she was most proud of, the hand that had established her in the medical world, was now ruined.

How could she accept this? How was she supposed to accept this?

For the next while, Aiden stayed by Sophia's side, personally taking care of everything for her, even helping her wash up.

Sophia spent a full week in the hospital before she was discharged.

On the way home, Sophia stared out the window without a word. Aiden reached out and took her hand, his face full of tenderness.

""Sophia, I've arranged a special wake ceremony for your mother and sister tomorrow. We'll give them a grand and proper send-off.""

Hearing about the wake ceremony, Sophia's expression softened slightly. But just as she was about to speak, Aiden's phone rang.

Sophia glanced at the caller ID. It was Isabella.

""Aiden, my mother's chest is hurting again. I don't know what to do. Can you come and be with me?""

Aiden slammed on the brakes and spoke reassuringly into the phone.

""Wait for me at the hospital. I'll be right there.""

After hanging up, Aiden looked at Sophia with a grave expression.

""Sophia, just take a taxi home yourself!

Isabella needs someone with her!""

Sophia let out a cold laugh.

""Are you a doctor?

Can you cure her mother just by going there?""

Aiden's face instantly darkened.

""Sophia, her mother has severe complications precisely because of your botched surgery. I'm just trying to help you atone for your guilt!""

After saying that, Aiden got out of the car and pulled Sophia's door open.

""Get out!""

Sophia looked at the man before her and found it laughable. So love really could be faked.

The moment Sophia got out, Aiden impatiently started the car and sped off, leaving her alone on an unfamiliar street.

This area was near the suburbs, deserted and desolate. She couldn't even hail a cab.

As dusk began to settle and the shadows grew longer, Sophia took a step forward. Suddenly, several large, imposing figures to emerge from the alley.

Sophia watched them warily, a bad feeling rising in her heart. She turned to run, but her path was blocked.

""Isn't this the sister of that 'action movie' star everyone's been talking about?

The little sister knows how to have fun, so I bet the older sister's skills aren't too bad either!""

One of them grabbed Sophia's arm. She tried to shake him off, but she couldn't summon any strength.

""Do you have any idea who I am?

If you dare touch me, I won't let you get away with it.""

Seeing her struggle, the men laughed even more wildly and began dragging Sophia deeper into the alley.

""Let's have some fun with her today, boys!""

Sophia screamed her lungs out, but her cries were only met with the men's excited laughter.

""You can scream your throat raw today, no one is coming to save you.""

One of them began forcefully tearing at her clothes. In desperation, Sophia bit down hard on one of their hands and then ran for it with all her might.

They scrambled to chase after her, but in the next second, their laughter grew even more smug.

""This is the suburbs. Behind you, there's nothing but Nordhaven Lake!""

Without a second thought, Sophia leaped over the railing and plunged into the lake.

The icy water instantly enveloped Sophia. She thought she could hear people arguing on the shore.

""The client just said to ruin her, not to kill her! If something happens, who's going to take the blame?""

Chapter 5

Chapter 5

When Sophia opened her eyes again, she was back at the Blackwood family mansion.

She had just tried to sit up when she heard a loud crash from the living room.

Aiden had violently smashed the vase in his hand onto the floor.

""No matter the cost, find those men. My wife was violated. If anyone dares to breathe a word of this, I'll kill them!""

Isabella leaned on Aiden's shoulder, gently stroking his back.

""Aiden, maybe Sophia is a victim in this too?""

At the mention of Sophia's name, Aiden's face turned terrifyingly dark, and he slammed his fist hard onto the glass coffee table.

""Whether she's a victim or not, what's done is done. How could I accept a tainted wife?""

""What's the difference between her and her sister now?""

Sophia stood in the corner, her hands clenched tightly together. Aiden's words were like a sharp blade, brutally carving the flesh from her heart, leaving her in agony, struggling to breathe.

He hadn't even asked her. He just assumed she was tainted!

The next morning, Sophia arrived at the wake ceremony. Aiden had arranged for her mother and sister.

In the main hall, the two people who had been so full of life sitting before her just a month ago were now just black-and-white memorial portraits displayed up front.

Sophia knelt on a kneeling cushion, continuously burning joss paper in the ritual brazier. It seemed only this could soothe her heart, even just a little.

From eight in the morning until noon, not a single person came to attend the wake ceremony.

Even Aiden, who had initially promised to give her mother and sister a grand send-off, was nowhere to be seen.

Sophia glanced at the time. It was almost the auspicious hour for the burial. She looked at the empty hall, then picked up her mother's and sister's urns and walked out alone.

Just as she stepped out of the wake hall, a crowd of reporters suddenly swarmed her.

""Miss Collins, we heard you were assaulted by several men in an alley yesterday. Does Mr. Blackwood know about this?""

""Miss Collins, were you assaulted, or were you a willing participant?

From what I saw in the video, you seemed to be enjoying it.

Could it be that you're just as promiscuous as your sister, deep down?""

""Miss Collins, first your mother gets herself killed staging an accident, then your sister dies by suicide out of shame from fooling around with men, and now you've been violated. Could it be your whole family is just that kind of people?""

Every sharp, sarcastic question was like a needle, piercing Sophia to the bone. Her eyes bloodshot with rage, she glared at the crowd.

""Shut up! My family is not for a bunch of people who can't tell right from wrong to judge!""

Sophia tried to escape, but someone yanked her back forcefully.

""Miss Collins, got a guilty conscience? The news of your secret rendezvous with a man is all over Nordhaven. You're just as cheap as your sister. Aren't you afraid the Blackwood family will kick you out?""

Sophia stumbled and fell to the ground, the urns flying from her hands.

In the chaos, someone stepped on an urn. It was kicked aside, and the ashes inside spilled all over the ground.

Like a madwoman, Sophia scrambled forward on her knees, her trembling hands trying to scoop the ashes back into her palms.

""Get away! All of you, get away from me!""

But the crowd, as if on purpose, kept trampling on her mother's and sister's ashes. Sophia completely broke down, consumed by despair and helplessness.

""Don't step on my mother's and sister's ashes, I'm begging you, please don't.""

But the reporters, as if they hadn't heard, aimed all their cameras at the disheveled Sophia.

Sophia tried to get up, but someone shoved her hard. She fell backward, a sharp pain piercing the back of her head.

Then, someone in the crowd let out a terrified scream: ""Blood, so much blood!""

The next second, a dozen Bentleys slowly pulled up. Before the cars had even come to a complete stop, Aiden threw open his door and rushed out.

""What are you all doing?""

Aiden looked with heartache at Sophia lying in a pool of blood. He was about to pull her into his arms, but his hands froze mid-air. Then he turned his head to his assistant.

""You take my wife to the hospital!""

The assistant looked at Aiden, troubled.

""Mr. Blackwood, I don't think that's a good idea.

You should be the one to carry your wife!""

But Aiden turned his back, not sparing Sophia another glance.

""I find her filthy!""

Those words were like a giant boulder, crushing Sophia's heart!

Chapter 6

Chapter 6

Just as Sophia was about to sit up in her hospital bed, her phone rang.

It was a text from the hospital.

\[Hello, Ms. Sophia Collins. Due to your moral misconduct, which has severely damaged the hospital's reputation, your employment is hereby terminated.\]

Sophia looked at the text and let out a self-mocking laugh.

When they needed her, they treated her like the moon in the sky. When they didn't, they cast her aside like a worn-out shoe!

Sophia was in the hospital for three whole days, and Aiden never once appeared.

After being discharged, she returned home. Just as Sophia was about to push the door open, she froze.

""I will not divorce Sophia!

Don't let me hear you say that again!""

Aiden slammed his fist viciously onto the table, and the glass top instantly shattered!

Madam Blackwood sat on the sofa, her face grim, her eyes filled with disgust and dissatisfaction for Sophia.

""A video of her being defiled by all those men has spread throughout Nordhaven. If you don't divorce her, are you going to wait for her to give you a bastard to be the Blackwood family heir?""

Aiden tore the divorce papers in front of him to shreds, his face terrifyingly dark.

""The day I found Sophia, I already forced a contraceptive pill down her throat. I will never touch her again, so she won't have a child. As for the heir, I will have Isabella bear the Blackwood family heir for me.""

Sophia stood outside the door, her hand clenched white-knuckled around the handle.

Aiden's so-called love was so twisted it made her skin crawl!

That night, the wind was biting cold. Sophia stood by the window and called her lawyer.

""Sell all of my shares in the Blackwood group.""

Although the lawyer on the other end of the line was confused, he didn't dare ask any questions.

""Understood. The proceedings for your divorce from Mr. Blackwood have also entered the final stages. You should be able to get the divorce decree in ten days at most!""

Sophia nodded.

""Please hurry. I have to leave in ten days!""

As soon as she finished speaking, the door was thrown open. Aiden stood in the doorway, his face ashen with fury.

""Where do you think you're going?""

Sophia's hand holding the phone tightened. Just as she was about to speak, a series of knocks echoed from downstairs.

The moment Aiden opened the door, Isabella threw herself into his arms, her face full of sorrow.

""Aiden, ever since my mother's surgery, she's been having frequent chest pains. What should I do!""

Aiden held her in his arms, comforting her softly, his gaze sweeping coldly over Sophia at his side.

""Why does Isabella's mother have such severe complications?

What exactly did you do during the surgery?""

Sophia looked at Isabella and scoffed.

""I operated on her mother's brain. As for why her chest hurts, you should ask her yourself.""

Hearing this, Isabella cried even more pitifully.

""Aiden, I heard that the Serpent’s Tongue from the deep sea can relieve all of a person's discomfort!""

""Since Sophia says my mother's discomfort has nothing to do with her, then I'll go to the bottom of the sea to find the herb myself!

She's the only mother I have. I can't bear to watch her suffer from this illness.""

Just as Isabella was about to leave, Aiden pulled her forcefully into his arms.

""You can't swim. You'll get hurt if you go down there.""

After speaking, Aiden turned his gaze to Sophia.

""Sophia, Isabella's mother's complications are your fault. You go find the Serpent’s Tongue.

Consider it your atonement.""

Chapter 7

Chapter 7

Sophia looked at Aiden in disbelief, her gaze icy.

""My greatest sin was saving her mother!""

Aiden's expression instantly darkened.

""Sophia, how have you become so vicious and unreasonable?""

Then, Aiden opened the photo gallery on his phone, showing a picture of two Sandalwood Urns.

""I had my men gather the rest of your mother's and Henrietta's ashes. Whether you get them back is up to you!""

Sophia's eyes filled with tears as she clenched her jaw, staring at Aiden.

""Even if Isabella's mother is unwell, the hospital has doctors, nurses, and the most advanced medical equipment, yet you absurdly believe Isabella about some Serpent’s Tongue?

Aiden, don't you find that ridiculous?""

Aiden's expression remained cold: ""Sophia, I don't want to say the same thing twice!""

Sophia looked at Aiden, utterly hopeless, and nodded in desolate agreement.

""Fine, I'll go!""

Soon, Sophia was taken out to sea on a yacht.

This area of the sea wasn't deep, its deepest point no more than a hundred meters, but it was still a diver's limit!

Fully geared up, Sophia watched Aiden sitting in the cabin, sipping red wine with Isabella, her heart turning to ash.

Isabella brought the wine glass she had been drinking from to Aiden's lips.

""Aiden, letting Sophia go into the water on such a cold day... won't something happen?""

Aiden tilted his head back and drained the wine, a faint smile playing on his lips.

""Sophia used to love diving when she was stressed. She was even the champion of the swim team in college. Don't worry!""

The cold sea wind whipped across Sophia's face, and she subconsciously clenched her right hand.

Aiden seemed to have forgotten that the tendons in her hand had been severed.

Bright lights shone on the surface of the sea as Sophia jumped in, the icy water instantly submerging her.

At night, even with the lights, visibility under the sea was less than a meter.

Sophia swam relentlessly toward the seabed. Only by retrieving the item as quickly as possible could she ensure her own safety.

Just as she reached the seabed, a hundred meters deep, she suddenly saw a school of fish swimming rapidly toward her.

Before Sophia could react, she was knocked aside by a giant devil ray.

A sharp pain shot through her abdomen. Sophia ignored the tearing wound, flailing her arms just to keep herself upright.

But in the next instant, Sophia saw that behind the school of fish was a massive shark.

A jolt of alarm shot through Sophia. Just as she was about to swim upward, she caught sight of the Serpent’s Tongue, drifting right below her.

Sophia glanced at the approaching shark. The image of the ashes—trampled underfoot by those people—flashed through her mind. Gritting her teeth, she lunged downward, snatched the Serpent’s Tongue, and immediately shot upward with all her speed.

But in the next instant, the shark lunged forward, its cavernous jaws snapping at Sophia.

Sophia didn't dare hesitate. She unstrapped her oxygen tank and hurled it at the beast, buying herself a precious second.

Just as she was about to break the surface, a tearing pain shot through Sophia's wrist, leaving her without the strength to even move her arms.

Starved of oxygen, her mind went blank, and her consciousness began to fade.

Just as she was sinking toward the shark's gaping maw, the surface of the sea erupted, and a figure swam frantically toward her.

Sophia looked at Aiden's frantic, panicked face and found it utterly ridiculous.

Aiden, if I could, I wish I had never met you!

Chapter 8

Chapter 8

The night she returned to the Blackwood mansion, Sophia came down with a high fever. She burned for days before she was finally able to manage a little porridge.

One day, as Sophia was packing her belongings into a suitcase, the door was suddenly thrown open.

Aiden stormed in, his face livid, and violently grabbed Sophia's hand.

""What did you do to the Serpent’s Tongue?

Why did Isabella's mother start vomiting and having diarrhea after taking it? Her condition has gotten even worse!""

Sophia tried to wrench her hand free from Aiden's grasp, but she had no strength.

""You took the Serpent’s Tongue yourself. Now that something's wrong, you come blaming me?""

Aiden's eyes were dark as he glared at her.

""Sophia, your methods are as filthy as you are. You'd better pray nothing happens to Isabella's mother, or I swear I won't let you off.""

Sophia froze. Aiden's look of disgust was a sharp blade, carving her up a thousand times over.

Aiden raised a hand, and two bodyguards immediately rushed in.

His gaze on Sophia was glacial.

""Since you still refuse to repent, you will go kneel at the hospital entrance. Kneel until Isabella's mother is out of danger!""

Sophia raised her head and looked at him in disbelief.

""Aiden, you're making me kneel for a murderer's mother?""

Aiden's expression was icy.

""It's time you learned to pay the price for your mistakes!""

Sophia's fists clenched tightly.

""The biggest mistake I ever made was marrying you!""

Aiden froze, his expression darkening instantly.

""Take her away. She is not to get up without my permission!""

Sophia was dragged to the hospital entrance like a criminal. When she refused to kneel, a bodyguard kicked her hard in the back of the leg.

With a heavy thud, Sophia collapsed to her knees at the hospital entrance, the mocking gazes of the crowd burning into her.

""Isn't that the famous genius doctor, Sophia?

So why is she kneeling here like a criminal?""

""They say she was meeting a man in secret, and abused her position, causing severe post-op complications for a patient. She deserves to die!""

The crowd milled about, their mocking gazes like sharp swords, slowly carving into Sophia.

Sophia had been kneeling from morning until night when Isabella finally emerged slowly from the hospital entrance.

""Miss Collins, my mother is out of danger. I specially pleaded with Aiden to let you go back and rest!""

As her voice fell, the phone in Sophia's pocket vibrated.

It was a message from her lawyer.

\[Miss Collins, your divorce proceedings with Mr. Blackwood are all complete. I've sent the divorce decree to you by courier. The shares have also been settled, and the funds have been transferred to your account. Please check for them.\]

Reading the message, Sophia let out a sigh of relief. She could finally leave.

Then, Sophia struggled to her feet, her gaze sharp as she looked at Isabella.

""Isabella, I'll be waiting to see what becomes of you.""

With that, she straightened her back and walked, step by step, into the darkness of the night.

After leaving the hospital, Sophia went straight home.

She pulled her luggage, took one last look at the house that had imprisoned her for five years, and walked out of the gates of the Blackwood mansion without a shred of reluctance.

Just as she reached the main gate, a Maybach pulled to a steady stop in front of Sophia.

The car window slowly rolled down, revealing a chiseled, cold face.

""Sophia, long time no see!""

·············

The hospital.

Aiden was sitting in the hallway when Isabella's attending physician walked over with a test report.

""Mr. Blackwood, according to the patient's test results, Isabella's mother developed gastroenteritis because she ignored medical advice and consumed a large amount of greasy dishes. It's nothing serious. There were no issues with Dr. Collins' surgery.""

Aiden's hand, holding the report, froze. Just as he was about to speak, his phone suddenly rang.

It was a call from Madam Blackwood.

""Aiden, something's happened. Your father was in a car accident. A piece of glass is lodged in his heart. He needs emergency surgery, but the location of the glass is too dangerous. Not a single doctor in Nordhaven dares to take the case.""

A flicker of panic crossed Aiden's eyes, but the doctor standing beside him suddenly spoke up.

""Of all the surgeons in Nordhaven, I reckon only Dr. Collins would dare to perform this surgery. It's a pity her hand is ruined, but we could have Dr. Collins guide from the side. There might be a sliver of hope!""

The moment Aiden heard this, he immediately dialed Sophia's number.

But the next second, Aiden's expression instantly darkened.

He gripped the phone tightly as a robotic female voice droned on.

**TLDR:** Here's what's happened:

* I'm a small creator with about a year on MakerWorld, with 2-3 models that have some popularity.
* I recently learnt how to make flexible objects, and made flexible flags which gained traction and started taking requests from the community.
* I uploaded the 4th batch of flags, which included Taiwan.
* Woke up the next morning with a full account suspension;
   * Reason: ""Potentially Controversial Content""
   * All models removed.
   * All points I've ever earned being removed from my account, putting me in a negative balance.
   * That makes a fine of about 10,000 points (\~£650 in vouchers).
   * No activity allowed for 1 year.



I now need some advice on moving forward.

The reasons I used MakerWorld, especially starting as a beginner, was for the following reason:

* The 3mf files make it super easy to use with Bambu printers, especially when you have modifications in the slicer (layer height, speed, colour, etc).
* The community is amazing.
* Coming from an AnkerMake before, both ""it just works"" and the pricing was attractive.

I know Printables and a few other places exist, but I did like earning points/vouchers with MakerWorld.

What would you all do? 

Because I'm a developer and designer anyway, I'm probably going to create a portfolio website with my STL and 3MF files, and some sort of ""buy me a coffee"" or Patreon, but keep everything free. This will be my fallback in any case, because I've had people asking me to send them models directly since the ban.

But what (other) online platform should I use? Shall I just create a new MakerWorld account and start afresh?",0,1767886830.0,3Dprinting,19,0.5,False

So I enrolled in an MBA thinking I’d become a future CEO, wear sharp suits, speak fluent “strategy”, and casually say things like “Let’s circle back” without irony.

Reality check:
I became a PPT-making machine, caffeine-dependent philosopher, and a professional deadline negotiator.

Week 1:
“Networking is key 🤝”
Week 3:
Avoiding eye contact so no one adds me to another group project.

Classes taught me many important life lessons like:
	•	8 AM classes are a crime against humanity
	•	90% attendance is a suggestion, not a lifestyle
	•	One person does the work, three give “inputs”, one disappears like a startup founder after funding

MBA curriculum highlights:
	•	Subjects I’ll never use but must memorize
	•	Case studies where companies earn ₹10,000 crore and still need my opinion
	•	Exams where the answer is always “It depends”

Internship season?
A spiritual journey of rejection emails that start with “We appreciate your interest…”
No bro, you don’t. Just say no.

Placements be like:
	•	Expectations: ₹15 LPA
	•	Reality: “Great exposure and learning opportunity”

Somehow, despite all this:
	•	I learned to survive on 4 hours of sleep
	•	I can make a presentation on any topic in 30 minutes
	•	I now say “stakeholder” at least 5 times a day

MBA didn’t make me rich.
MBA made me resilient, sarcastic, and dangerously confident in group discussions.

I built this distraction-free environment inspired by the minimalist design of Notion, specifically for people who value intentional writing and deep connection.

### A Clean Foundation for Quality Interaction

**Minimalist Design:** Episto uses a property-based system for profiles and communities. It is organized, aesthetic, and free of the algorithmic noise and flashy notifications found on mainstream platforms.

**Extreme Interest Matching:** The interest system I built is granular. Whether you are into specific music sub-genres, specialty coffee brewing, or niche tech stacks, you can find people who share your exact passions.

**Integrated Social Presence:** Connect your Spotify or Last.fm profiles to share your current listening habits automatically, or display your Duolingo progress to others in the community.

**Interactive Mapping:** Track your travels and see where other members are located on a global, interactive map. It is designed to help you make connections before you even reach your next destination.

### Learning and Growing Together

Episto is built as a home for language learners and cultural exchange. I included dedicated tools to help you improve while you socialize:

**Social Corrections:** The platform includes a native correction system. You can help your partners by providing friendly corrections to their messages or posts, making it a practical tool for language acquisition.

**Top 3 Lists:** Share your personality through curated ""Top 3"" lists of your favorite books, movies, or hobbies, displayed directly on your profile in a clean, interactive grid.

**Streaks and Recognition:** I use a streak and badge system to reward genuine, consistent engagement. It is not about likes; it is about the frequency and quality of your interactions.

### Join the Ground Floor: Open Beta

We are currently in **Open Beta**. This means the community is still small and the culture is being shaped right now. If you join today, you aren't just a user; you are a pioneer helping us decide what Episto will become.

If you are tired of the speed and drama of traditional social media and want a space where you can actually think and write, I would love to have you.

The next morning, Sarah approached the large dog crate at the foot of their bed with a key in hand, her silk robe loosely tied around her naked form. Emily had barely slept, her body sore from the previous night's degradations, the welts on her skin throbbing faintly under the thin blanket. The click of the padlock echoed in the quiet room as Sarah swung the door open. ""Out, slave,"" she commanded sharply, her voice brooking no delay. Emily crawled out stiffly, her joints aching, naked and marked, blinking against the morning light filtering through the curtains.

""Put on your new clothes,"" Sarah ordered, pointing to a neatly folded pile on the dresser. Emily's hands shook as she dressed: first, the black leather collar, thick and unyielding, with ""SLAVE"" embossed in silver letters across the front—a constant reminder of her status. It buckled snugly around her neck, the D-ring at the front dangling like a promise of restraint. Next came the leather full-body harness, intricate straps crisscrossing her torso, framing her perky breasts and dipping between her legs to accentuate her smooth pussy, adorned with multiple D-rings for attachments. Wrist and ankle cuffs followed, black leather with sturdy metal rings, clicking into place. Finally, sheer fishnet stockings that hugged her legs from thigh to toe, the mesh digging slightly into her skin. Fully attired, Emily looked like a vision of submission—vulnerable, erotic, utterly owned.

She descended the stairs slowly, the harness shifting with each step, the collar a weighty collar around her throat. In the dining room, Sarah and Mark sat side by side at the table, dressed in casual morning attire—Mark in boxers and a t-shirt, Sarah in her robe. Emily's phone lay in Sarah's hand, the screen glowing faintly.

Sarah glanced up with a satisfied smirk. ""Good morning, pet. I took the liberty of texting your parents as you last night. Told them you hate them, cursed them out for being controlling pricks, said you've run away and won't be coming back. Blocked their numbers too."" She slid the phone across the table, showing the sent messages—harsh words Emily would never have uttered, but now etched into permanence. ""No one's looking for you anymore. This way, no one will ever want to. You're erased from your old life.""

Emily's stomach dropped, tears pricking her eyes, but she bit her lip, knowing resistance was futile. Sarah continued, ""Besides sexually pleasing us whenever we demand it, you'll be our housemaid. Clean, cook, serve—whatever we say. Start now: make us coffee. Black for me, cream and sugar for Mark. Bring it here.""

Emily hurried to the kitchen, her fishnet-clad feet padding softly on the tile. She prepared the mugs carefully, the aroma filling the air, then carried them back on a tray, kneeling submissively at their feet to present them.

Sarah took a sip, nodding approval. ""Good. Now, on your knees properly. Open Mark's robe and blow him while he drinks his coffee.""

Emily obeyed, parting Mark's robe to reveal his morning erection, thick and veined. She leaned in, her collared neck brushing his thigh, and took him into her mouth—lips wrapping around the head, tongue swirling tentatively at first, then deeper. Mark groaned softly, sipping his coffee casually as if this were routine.

""As you're sucking him,"" Sarah added nonchalantly, ""open my robe and rub my pussy. Make me feel good while I enjoy my coffee.""

Emily's free hand reached up, parting Sarah's robe to expose her shaved mound. Her fingers found the warm, slick folds, rubbing in slow circles over the clit, dipping inside occasionally. Sarah leaned back in her chair, legs spreading wider, sipping her coffee with a contented sigh. ""That's it, slave. Serve us like the whore you are.""

Emily worked them both rhythmically—bobbing her head on Mark's cock, taking him deeper, gagging softly as she forced more in, her saliva coating him. Her fingers pumped Sarah's pussy, thumb circling the clit. The harness straps dug into her skin with her movements, heightening her awareness of her submission. Mark's breaths grew ragged; Emily sucked harder, deeper, hollowing her cheeks until he tensed and came with a low grunt, flooding her mouth with thick, salty cum. She swallowed instinctively, a forbidden thrill at the taste despite everything.

Sarah set her mug down abruptly, grabbing a fistful of Emily's blonde hair and yanking her face from Mark's softening cock straight into her own dripping pussy. ""I told you he can't cum inside you anymore, and here you are enjoying his load like a greedy slut. That's not allowed."" She ground Emily's face against her mound, smearing wetness. ""Eat me now—and spit his cum out onto my pussy. Use it as lube.""

Emily complied, her anger and hunger mixing in a frenzy. She shoved the remnants of Mark's cum from her mouth onto Sarah's clit, then dove in—tongue lapping hungrily at the folds, sucking the nub, probing deep. Sarah moaned, hips bucking, her grip tightening in Emily's hair. The taste was a humiliating cocktail—Mark's semen mingling with Sarah's juices—but Emily ate angrily, desperately, until Sarah arched and came hard, flooding her mouth with release.

Sarah and Mark finished their coffee leisurely, then rose to dress for work—professional attire for their offices. ""Eat something quick yourself,"" Sarah said dismissively. ""Then clean the entire house. Spotless by the time we get home, or else. Dinner on the table, hot and ready."" Before leaving, she produced a thick butt plug from her pocket, lubed it quickly, and shoved it into Emily's ass with a firm push. Emily gasped at the intrusion, clenching around it. ""Don't take it out. We're preparing you for tonight.""

The door shut behind them, leaving Emily alone. She ate a hasty breakfast, the plug shifting with every movement, a constant pressure that made her pussy throb unwillingly. Cleaning was arduous—the harness and stockings restricting slightly, the collar chafing, the plug rubbing her insides with each bend and stretch. She vacuumed, dusted, scrubbed counters, her body hyper-aware, arousal building shamefully from the fullness.

When Sarah and Mark returned that evening, the house gleamed immaculately, dinner—roast chicken, vegetables, wine—steaming on the table. Sarah inspected briefly, her expression softening almost to niceness. ""Not bad, pet. Almost impressed.""

They sat at opposite ends of the long dining table. ""You can eat too,"" Mark said gruffly, but added, ""Quickly—you have work."" Emily scarfed her plate standing, then Sarah commanded, ""Under the table now. On all fours, ass facing Mark, face toward me.""

Emily crawled beneath, the wood above her head, positioning as ordered. Mark unzipped, his cock hardening as he positioned it at her exposed pussy, the harness framing it perfectly. Sarah hiked her dress, pulling panties aside. ""Eat me and fuck him—rock back and forth like the slutty pendulum you are.""

Emily rocked, impaling herself on Mark's cock while tonguing Sarah's pussy—deep licks, clit suction. Above, they ate dinner casually, chatting about work—Mark's project delays, Sarah's client meetings—mostly ignoring the girl servicing them. Emily's moans were muffled, her body straining in the confined space, the plug amplifying every thrust.

Dinner finished, Sarah yanked Emily out by the leash clipped to her collar, leading her to the living room like a dog. Sarah's eyes narrowed at a faint stain on the carpet. ""What is that?"" she yelled.

""I... spilled a drink earlier,"" Emily stammered. ""It wouldn't come out completely.""

Fury ignited Sarah's face. She threw Emily to the floor, shoving her face into the carpet, fist in hair grinding her down. ""You disobedient bitch!""

Sarah's palm came down like thunder on Emily's exposed ass, the first smack echoing through the room like a gunshot, the fishnet stockings offering no protection as her flesh jiggled and reddened instantly under the force. Emily yelped, her cheek pressed hard into the rough carpet fibers, which scraped her skin raw with each grind of Sarah's grip in her hair. Another blow landed on the back of her thigh, the sting blooming into a deep burn that made her legs kick involuntarily, her harness straps digging into her hips as she squirmed. Sarah didn't stop—rain after rain of open-handed slaps assaulted her ass and thighs, turning the pale skin a mottled crimson, welts rising in angry ridges that throbbed with her racing heartbeat. Each impact sent shockwaves through her body, the butt plug shifting deeper inside her ass, pressing against her inner walls in a way that blurred pain and unwelcome arousal. Emily sobbed openly, tears soaking the carpet beneath her face, her freckled cheeks flushed with humiliation as snot dripped from her nose.

Not content with just spanking, Sarah's free hand snaked between Emily's trembling thighs, fingers roughly parting her slick pussy lips—already traitorously wet from the day's constant stimulation. She plunged two fingers inside without warning, the intrusion brutal and deep, curling them to hook against Emily's G-spot as she thrust in and out with punishing speed. Emily's walls clenched around the digits, juices coating Sarah's hand in glistening strings, the wet squelching sounds obscene in the quiet room. ""You think you can defy me?"" Sarah growled, adding a third finger to stretch her wider, pumping harder, her nails scraping lightly against sensitive flesh. Emily's hips bucked despite herself, a strangled moan escaping as pleasure coiled tight amid the agony.

Sarah hauled her up roughly by the hair, spinning her around and grabbing her throat from behind with one vise-like hand, squeezing just enough to make Emily's breath hitch, her collared neck straining against the leather. With her other hand, Sarah yanked out the butt plug in one swift pull, eliciting a sharp cry from Emily as her ass gaped momentarily, empty and aching. Then, without lube or mercy, Sarah shoved a single finger deep into the puckered hole, twisting it roughly, the dry friction burning as she probed and scissored. ""I told you to have the house spotless!"" Sarah hissed, her breath hot against Emily's ear. ""You've made it dirtier with your incompetence. I won't tolerate disobedience—not from a worthless cum rag like you."" Emily whimpered, her body arching, toes curling in her fishnets as the finger invaded deeper, hooking inside to press against nerves that sent conflicting sparks through her core.

Releasing her throat, Sarah pushed Emily back down onto the floor, flat on her back, the carpet rough against her welted skin. Sarah straddled her face in a reverse position, lowering her bare ass and pussy onto Emily's mouth with deliberate slowness, grinding down until her full weight smothered the girl. Emily's nose was buried in Sarah's crack, inhaling the musky scent as Sarah rubbed her dripping pussy and tight asshole back and forth across her lips, tongue, and nose—smearing sticky arousal in thick trails, coating her freckled face in glistening fluids. Emily gasped for air in stolen moments, her tongue forced to lap desperately at whatever was presented, tasting the salty tang of Sarah's excitement mixed with her own humiliation.

Grabbing the leather flogger from the nearby box, Sarah swung it with vicious precision, the suede tails cracking against Emily's exposed breasts first—the impact making her perky tits bounce and redden, nipples hardening painfully under the assault. Welts crisscrossed her pale skin, each lash drawing a muffled scream from beneath Sarah's grinding hips. The flogger moved lower, whipping her flat stomach, the strikes leaving red stripes that burned like fire, her abs contracting involuntarily. Then to her pussy—sharp cracks against the sensitive folds, the tails stinging her clit and lips, making her thighs clench and her juices flow even more copiously. Finally, the thighs, already sore from earlier spanks, now lashed until they glowed crimson, the fishnets tearing slightly under the force. ""Apologize, you filthy slut!"" Sarah demanded, her voice a whip itself.

Emily tried to cry out apologies, her words garbled and muffled by Sarah's smothering cheeks and slick pussy lips, vibrations from her pleas only heightening Sarah's pleasure. Sarah lifted her ass just enough for Emily to gasp air and speak, her face slick and shiny. ""I'm sorry... please, I'm so sorry..."" Emily sobbed, voice breaking.

Sarah's eyes gleamed with dark satisfaction. ""You'll be sorry when we're through with you."" She called over her shoulder, ""Mark, get over here. Mount this bitch and fuck her pussy—hard and deep, no holding back.""

Mark approached, shedding his clothes quickly, his cock already throbbing hard from watching the scene. He knelt between Emily's spread legs, gripping her harness for leverage, and slammed into her sopping pussy in one brutal thrust, burying himself to the hilt. Emily arched with a wail, her walls stretching around his thickness, the intrusion amplified by the day's teasing. He pounded relentlessly—deep, forceful strokes that made her breasts jiggle with each impact, his balls slapping wetly against her ass. Sarah leaned back on her hands for balance, her pussy hovering just above Emily's mouth, allowing the girl to tongue her butthole deeply—probing the tight ring, circling and sucking as ordered. Meanwhile, Mark leaned forward, his tongue lapping at Sarah's exposed pussy, flicking her clit and delving into her folds while he fucked Emily below.

Emily's body betrayed her utterly, pleasure building like a storm despite the degradation. She came hard mid-thrust, her pussy clenching rhythmically around Mark's cock, legs shaking uncontrollably, juices squirting in small gushes that soaked his shaft and dripped onto the carpet. But she didn't stop—her tongue continued rimming Sarah's ass through the waves, the overstimulation making her whimper and twitch.

Sarah threw her head back, moaning loudly as her own orgasm built from Mark's tongue and Emily's efforts, her body shuddering as she came, grinding down harder to flood Emily's face anew. But then she felt a shift—the air changed—and she looked down to see Mark and Emily's eyes locked in a moment of unintended connection? No—worse: Mark had paused slightly, his lips brushing Sarah's thigh, but his gaze was soft on Emily. Rage exploded in Sarah; she snatched the flogger and whipped Mark's back sharply, the tails cracking against his skin and leaving red marks. ""Stop that! She's not yours to pity or kiss—you fuck her like the toy she is!""

They disentangled quickly, Mark pulling out with a wet pop, his cock glistening. Sarah, still buzzing from her climax, used the D-rings on Emily's cuffs to link her wrists and ankles together with short chains, hoisting her arms and legs high in the air, her body folded and exposed in a helpless, immobilizing position on her back. She then forced a large red ball gag between Emily's lips, buckling it tightly, the glossy sphere stretching her jaw wide and muffling her whimpers into pathetic, drooling hums. ""Fuck her ass now,"" Sarah snarled at Mark, her voice dripping with venom. ""Make her feel it—every inch, no mercy.""

Mark knelt there, his throbbing cock slick and ready, gazing down at Emily's upturned face. Her wide blue eyes pleaded up at him, shimmering with fear and desperation, freckles stark against her flushed skin, the ball gag distorting her pretty features into something vulnerable and broken. Pity twisted in his gut at first, a fleeting ache for the girl he'd once whispered sweet nothings to in stolen moments. But then darker thoughts flooded in, hardening his resolve. This slut had almost ruined his marriage, her innocent smiles and teasing touches seducing him away from his vows. He'd promised to love Sarah forever, to be faithful through every trial, and this conniving bitch had made him forget that sacred oath. It was his duty now—to side with his wife always, to punish this homewrecker if that's what Sarah demanded. With a low growl, he positioned himself and slid deep into her tight ass in one unyielding thrust, her body jerking as she gasped sharply around the gag, the sound muffled into a wet, garbled cry.

He didn't hold back. His hips snapped forward with brutal force, speeding up into a relentless rhythm—harder, faster, over and over, each plunge stretching her puckered ring around his thick shaft, the friction burning hot and unforgiving. He grasped the straps of her harness like reins, yanking her bound form deeper onto him, then off, then deeper again, her body rocking violently in the chains, fishnets tearing further against the carpet. Emily's screams vibrated through the ball gag, saliva bubbling and dripping from the corners of her stretched mouth, trailing down her chin in glistening strings as she was pounded back and forth like a ragdoll. Her eyes rolled back in her head from the searing pain, white-hot and overwhelming, every thrust sending shockwaves through her core. Time blurred into an endless haze of agony; it felt like forever, her mind fracturing under the assault. Yet her traitorous body responded in waves—orgasms crashing over her unbidden, mostly as a desperate coping mechanism against the torment, her walls clenching spasmodically, juices leaking from her untouched pussy in shameful spurts.

Sarah watched from the side, her mouth falling open in surprise and awe, eyes wide as she took in this new, ferocious side of her husband. Emotions swirled chaotically in her head: excitement at his raw power, surprise at the intensity he'd never shown her before, deep impression at his unbridled ferocity. But jealousy gnawed too—that he was unleashing this savage passion on Emily, when Sarah secretly craved it for herself, her own body aching for such dominance. And beneath it all, a hint of shame flickered; had they gone too far, turning so rough and hateful toward this young woman caught in their web? Maybe, but the thought only fueled her arousal further. She couldn't help it—her hand slipped between her thighs, fingers rubbing her slick clit frantically as she watched, her breaths coming in ragged gasps until she shattered in a shuddering orgasm, juices coating her hand while Mark continued his merciless rhythm.

Meanwhile, Emily's shock pierced through the pain like a knife; the man she had loved, who had once held her tenderly, had transformed into this cruel force. Betrayal mixed with the intense agony, her body betraying her again and again in unwanted climaxes. Finally, after what seemed an eternity, Mark slowed his punishing pace, his groans deepening as he pulled out with a slick pop, leaving Emily's butthole gaping obscenely, red and abused, a thin trail of her own arousal dripping from it. Sarah leaned in, unbuckling the ball gag with a satisfied smirk, Emily's jaw aching as she gasped for air, drool-smeared and tear-streaked. Without a word, Sarah retrieved a large vibrating dildo—thick, veined, humming with power—and a matching vibrating butt plug from the box. She coated them roughly with lube from Emily's own dripping pussy, then shoved the dildo deep into the girl's sopping cunt, twisting it until it seated fully, the ridges dragging against her oversensitive walls. Emily gasped, hips bucking as Sarah turned it on high, the vibrations humming through her core like an earthquake. Next, the butt plug—wider than the previous one—rammed into her still-gaping ass, stretching the ring painfully before popping in, its buzz syncing with the dildo to create a relentless dual assault that made Emily's toes curl and her clit throb visibly.

The toys buzzed mercilessly inside her, building another orgasm already.

For the final humiliation, Sarah orchestrated the positions carefully. Mark knelt above Emily's head, his balls and ass hovering directly over her mouth, the musky scent filling her nostrils. Sarah lay on her back perpendicular, her legs spread wide, her crotch positioned just over the top of Emily's forehead, her pussy inches from the girl's hairline. Mark entered Sarah slowly at first, then with building rhythm—thrusting deep into her wet heat, his body rocking back and forth. Emily's tongue was forced into action: lapping at his heavy balls as they swung forward, sucking them gently, then darting up to rim his ass on the backstroke, her tongue sliding along the perineum and occasionally brushing the base of his shaft where it plunged into Sarah. The motion was hypnotic, degrading—Emily's face a mere accessory to their fucking.

Sarah's pussy juices and Mark's precum dripped copiously from their union, splattering into Emily's blonde hair, matting it in sticky, messy strands that clung to her forehead and temples. The scent was overwhelming—salty, musky, arousal-thick—mixing with the vibrations tearing through her own body. Emily burned with disgust and humiliation, her cheeks flaming as she tasted the intimate flavors of their coupling, ashamed that this had become her life: reduced to a living sex toy, saddened by how the man she once loved now treated her with such casual cruelty. Yet, beneath the shame, arousal surged uncontrollably—the freedom of having no choice, the complete submission to her masters intoxicating her. She orgasmed hard in relentless waves, her pussy and ass clenching around the buzzing toys, juices squirting in arcs that soaked her thighs and the carpet below, her muffled moans vibrating against Mark's skin.

Mark's thrusts grew erratic, his groans deepening. Suddenly, he pulled out of Sarah, pivoting slightly to shove his slick cock—all coated in her juices—straight down Emily's throat. He put his full weight on her head, hands pinning either side of her face to the floor, forcing every inch past her lips deep into her throat. Emily choked violently, gagging as the thick shaft blocked her airway, her throat convulsing around him in desperate spasms. Lightheadedness set in quickly, stars dancing in her vision, her body squirming futilely against the cuffs, chains rattling as she strained, the vibrating toys amplifying the sensory overload into a dizzying haze. Panic rose, but so did a twisted thrill; she felt utterly owned, broken.

Finally, Mark came with a guttural roar, flooding her throat deep with hot, thick ropes of cum that she swallowed desperately amid her choking, some bubbling back up through her nose in messy strands. He held there for agonizing seconds, then pulled out quickly. Emily coughed and gagged explosively, spitting up loads of cum that dribbled from her mouth and nose, mixing with tears and saliva on her chin, her chest heaving as she gasped for air.

Sarah laughed cruelly, watching the spectacle. ""I said before that Mark isn't allowed to cum in you anymore, but throats seem like a good exception—deep enough to choke on your punishment.""

Exhausted and wrecked, Emily was told to go clean up and get ready for bed in her cage. She stumbled to the bathroom, scrubbing the sticky mess from her face and hair under scalding water, her body still buzzing faintly from the toys she'd removed. Back in the bedroom, she crawled into the crate, curling up tightly, her legs shaking and the heat between her thighs a persistent ache. Apprehension and curiosity swirled in her mind—what horrors or twisted pleasures awaited tomorrow? As she drifted toward uneasy sleep, she heard Sarah and Mark in bed above, their voices low and intimate, whispering their plans for her—dark promises of more degradation, more breaking, more ways to use their new pet.",1,1767886413.0,u_jl5879,0,1.0,False

I asked why she called me that and she said ""I just wanted to remind you who was in charge."" So I said ""Oh does that mean I'm in charge now?"" She actually laughed with a real laugh and said ""No, it just means you're in charge in the bedroom.""

If all I am interested in is espresso, should I just go for a lever machine?

As I'm currently exploring a place to visit this summer, Jordan came across the posibilities. I'd love to get some insights from you guys :)!

First of all, to give some context, I'm a mid-twenties male from Western Europe, reverted to Islam a few years ago. Limited solo-travel experience outside of Europe, frequent traveler to Morocco.

  
To start off with maybe the most important question: how is the weather around early july (first week or two)?

  
Also, if I were to visit for about a week, would you recommend visiting multiple cities? Or would a stay in Amman (for example) and maybe one or two daytrips to different areas or cities around the country be sufficient to spend the week? I'm not the most 'active' traveller, I love to just explore the cities a little bit but spend the most of my time chilling, hopping from mosque to mosque for prayers and especially enjoy the local food, culture and tea/coffee facilities. 

  
Lastly, how is the current political/safety situation in the country?

  
Thank you in advance!

I decided to clean up the dollhouse my mom built for me from a kit in the 1990s. The plan was to give it away, maybe to a friend's kid who wanted it, but there was no interest there. But in preparation for that, I started cleaning up the dollhouse and all the furniture and accessories. 

And then I decided to set it up for one last time ™️

... oh no it has reawakened something in me.

Some notes to go with the photos: 

* While this was (according to my mom, at least) supposed to be a Victorian dollhouse, a 10-12 year old kid doesn't have a great idea of what ""Victorian"" is, plus I was happy to take what furniture and accessories were given to me. 
* Same with scale: I believe it is supposed to be 1:12, but I would take what was given to me! So in some places it kinda looks like Alice in Wonderland lives there.
* I borrowed a lot of stuff from other toy sets I had, and I also got pretty ingenious with making stuff with trash I found laying around. There are mattresses made with Harry & David foam packaging covered with scraps of unbleached muslin in the shape of coffee filters (my mom made reusable coffee filters at the time). There are paintings made out of postage stamps (acquired thanks to a grandmother who worked for an international accounting firm), with paper frames hand-decorated with my colored pencil art. There are side tables made from those round plastic pizza box supports. I used upholstery fabric samples for bedding and for rugs, and hand-sewed tiny dresses to fit in tiny matchboxes.

And some questions:

* Anyone know what kit this is supposed to be? My mom is sadly deceased, and all the packaging for it was long ago thrown out. 
* I'm not sure what the top floor is supposed to be. It was never finished, if it's meant to be. (Sounds like my mom -- she probably rushed to finish it before Christmas). Why are there no stairs to that floor? Should it be divided into rooms? 
* It has electric, but it seems to be wired up to have these tiny 1:12 outlets made by Cir-Kit (ck1004) rather than the standard size dollhouse electric plug. And unfortunately most of the lamp cords have either decayed over the years, or been chewed through by mice. So it seems like if I want to renovate the lighting, I'm going to need to get some new lamp cords + convert the base plugs to the ck1004 style (which seems reasonable, and no soldering required!) Any insight on that? Would it be better to just use the LED 3V battery lights?
* How does one remove wallpaper from a dollhouse wall?

Welp, my plans to give this away have evaporated, and I'm now considering renovating it to be a 19th century lady botanist's house. So, uh, hi. And thanks in advance for your help. ",30,1767885778.0,Dollhouses,2,1.0,False
1q7ekjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1q7ekjv/after_years_of_my_experience_this_one_problem_is/,After years of my experience (this one problem is stopping you from manifesting your sp),"This is the most relatable challange with most of the people while manifesting sp.When you are aligned perfectly with visualization,feelings etc then sometimes suddenly everything feels like falling apart ...like your sp suddenly blocks you,something goes wrong,3p enters and many more and then doubts creeps in and we question our manifestation and then blame our ability to manifest and declare that manifestation doesnt work ....
After working with the people who were lacking deep love from within due to hidden limiting beliefs ,here is my experience on why things tears /falls apart and why its a perfect sign that you are aligned to manifest your sp.

The only time we experience and feel things going opposite to what we want is when we are doing manifestation stuff.

Basically our subconscious mind is programmed for safety and familiarity and subconscious does whatever it takes to maintain and magnify the identity and assumptions existing within.So it doesnt care about your sp at all ,it just amplifies what already exist in it .

For example:If you want your sp consciously but if there is a programs like love is hard to attract and deep love will hurt me at the end,men/women are cheaters then you will get more of those subconscious programs or so called beliefs.

Why things falls apart?
.Let us understand with an example.If a girl  wants to manifest his sp and she is trying different manifestation techniques and assumptions and suddenly she got something which is opposite to what she wants like for example suddenly her sp posts a pic with somebody else then what happens is that she will react and get triggered and doubt her manifestation and blame that manifestation isnt working but that is exactly what subconscious wants from you....your reaction .

When you are aligned to new self concept to manifest your sp then what happens is that your old self concept that sticked  with you like a glue gets frightened and it craves for the reaction to remain alive so it will create the illusion and stories and assumptions in your head and reality to make you react so that it can stay alive ...but the thing is mastering responding instead of reaction .Its like the hidden junks is getting revealed before getting cleaned up permanently .Like if there is a glass full of coffee and if we want to make it crystal clear then we have to put water in it consistently and at the same time ..the junk is getting onto the surface ..i am giving an analogy of a video where a person consistently fills water into a cup of coffee to make it crystal clear.

So basically when you are doing those inner work and suddenly everythings feels off then know that your old subconscious identity is tricking you to react to protect itself ...so instead of reacting ..respond and you will master it overtime .Calibrate adversity as opportunity.",5,1767885755.0,manifestingSP,1,1.0,False

Let’s consider this an exercise in acceptance. You will read some bad ideas, a lot of repetition, typos, and grammatical errors. Are you going to be okay with that? I would love to have my posts (and book) be a treasure-trove of witty epithets and pithy words that I could look so smart to espouse, but let’s get one thing straight, I am not going to waste my time. “Perfect” is the enemy of “good enough.” And that’s what these messages (and book) are aiming for. ~~Don’t forget to rate and review!~~

**Reflections**

Are you the type of person who won’t start something unless you know you can do it “perfectly?” Do you get paralysis when it comes to things you’ve never done before? How will you ever get better? How about spilling coffee on a white shirt on the way to work? Do you leave it? And if you do, do you think about it all day and let it steal your happiness?

**Daily Challenge**

Don’t wash the car. Don’t change shirts. Don’t pick it up (let someone else do it, for once). Try something new. Be unsure. Be messy. Be uneasy with being uneasy.

=======

I used to be so particular about things. Especially stains on my clothes. Trying to hold that perfect image. So afraid to let people see the ""messy me"". All the while, I was shitting blood and getting drunk every night in isolation. Also, I loved to write, but was too afraid to show anyone my work for fear that they might criticise me, or worse, see a fucking typo! Oh no! Eight years into soriety, I was writing a book, I had to remind myself that it was not going to be perfect and it would have to be ""ok""... and that I would be ""ok"" if it wasn't. I self-published with many typos and some mistakes, and every time I catch one, I smile, just a little.",2,1767885463.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False
1q7efxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Express-Ad-1903/comments/1q7efxs/my_dilaw/,MY DILAW 💛,"Hi! i met this guy sa online dating app. He reacted to my post and nagstart sya na kulitin ako sa chat. Actually, yung dating app kase na yun is may featured na pwedeng mag post ng pictures and thoughts para syang Twitter.

Hindi talaga ako tambay sa dating app na yun talagang na eenjoy ko lang na magpost ng mga pictures don. Di ko din hilig magreply sa mga nagchachat don kasi nga karamihan don is pervert and maniac talaga hahhaa lol. 😂

Pero ayun nga may isang guy na nag chat sakin at na caught talaga yung attention ko sa unang chat nya pa lang. ""Hi Burger buns!"" nagtaka ako nung una bat ganon ung tawidag nya sakin. Hanggang sa nagreply na ko at tinanong ""Y burger buns?""

Sabi nya; wala ang cute mo kasi tapos napansin ko na fave pose mo ung burger sign kaya ayun Burger buns ung tinawag ko sayo.

Actually napangiti talaga ako that time, wala lang parang first time kase na may bumanat sakin ng ganyang words e hahaha.

Nagtagal ung usapan ng halos 1hr  at surprisingly napalipat nya ko sa private socmeds ko. Haha madalang kase ako lumipat ng socmeds pag sa dating app galing yung kausap. Pero ayun na nga napalipat ako 😂

Hanggang yung simpleng usap nauwi sa confession! Aba realquick biglang crush nya na ako agad hahaha. Ang gaan lang ng usapan para lang kaming magtropa na nag ge-gay lingua pa. Simpleng kwentuhan na di na namin namamalayan umabot na ng higit dalawang oras yung video call.

Natutuwa ako sa kanya kase parehas kami ng mga trip sa buhay lalo na yung pag hahike. Mga dream place to visit, mga pagkaing gustong tikman. At kahit yung maliliit na bagay  talagang magkasundo.

""Meet half way tara Tagaytay!"" spontaneous na aya ko sa kanya kase i'm from Qc at sya naman ay taga Batangas. Haha di ko alam bat yan yung half way na nasabe ko haha siguro gusto ko lang din talaga sa tagaytay pumunta that time.

Sabe naman nya; Gusto nya kaso nga lang di pa mangyayare.

Nagtaka ko why! Ayun pala wala sya dito sa pinas. Nasa South korea pala sya kaya di pa kami makakapagkita.

Nagpatuloy lang yung usapan sa mga nagdaang araw. May Goodmorning - Goodnight thing, Kamusta araw mo, Kumain ka na ba, may update-tan din kung anong ginagawa at kung anong ulam ng. Umagahan, tanghalian, meryenda at hapunan.

Dumating din yung time na nagset na ng nicknames sa conversation. Syempre ako yung ""Burger Buns nya."" habang sya naman yung ""Cinnamon danish ko."" haha same kase kami ng favorite bread sa SB kaya ayan na lang yung ginamit kong nickname sa kanya.

Nung una naman normalan lang. Hanggang sa dumating na din sa point na parang nasa relationship na kami. Wala nga lang label hahaha

We do dating yung tipong nasa coffee shop ako at sya din sa korea nasa coffee shop habang magka videocall kami. 3-4hours lagi yung time pag magka VC kami at parang di kami nauubusan ng topic lalo na pagdating sa life perspectives. Sobrang effort din nya to the point na bawal talaga yung magphone sa oras ng duty nya pero he always find a ways para macontact ako every breaktime nya. Imagine 10mins yung 1st break tatakbo pa sya ng locker para magbukas ng phone at para mainform ako na 1st break sya. Next is 1hr break which is yung lunch nya, bibilisan nya kumain 5-10mins tas the rest nung oras nung 1hr break itatawag nya pa sakin para mangamusta if ano ba nangyare sa buong araw ko and to say goodnight. Then lastly, yung last 10mins break ulit nya itatakbo nya ulit ng locker nya para iupdate ako na last break na sya. Kahit tulog naman na ako non dito sa pinas haha. Hindi naman naging mahirap yung time adjustment namin kase 1hr advance lang naman yung Korea sa oras ng Pinas e.

Tinotour din nya ako sa Korea habang mag kavideocall at ganon din ako dito sa pinas sa mga ginagalaan ko kasama din sya haha (amg weird pero ansaya sa feeling)

Dumating pa ako sa time na naging impulsive decision maker na biglang naisipang mag enrolled sa isang Korean Class para mag aral ng Hangul at para makapag exam ng EPS topik at don na lang mag work sa korea para syempre makita sya at makasama. Haha pero ayun nga dahil impulsive di ko din tinuloy kase ang hirap talaga aralin ng korean language..

Hanggang sa unti unti naramdaman kong gusto ko na sya. ""Happy Crush ko na sya."" haha

Sinabe ko sa kanya un nag confess din ako that time. Nung una okay pa kinikilig kami parehas e hahaha kase syempre crush nya ko tas nacrush back ko sya. Mapalad sya hahhaa de joke!

Pero habang tumatagal lumalalim yung attachment. Dun na nagsimulang magbago. Bigla syang nag stepback. Di ko maintindihan nung una kase nga andon na e. Kumbaga next level na haha tas bigla syang nag laylow.

Nung una may reply pa. Hanggang sa parang biglang nawala na totally.

Nasaktan ako that time at kase feeling ko ghinost ako bigla e. Pero ayun nga life goes on di naman ako pwedeng magmukmok na lang at maiwan sa tanong na ""Bakit at ano nangyare.""

Nag move on ako kahit di naman naging kami. Bumalik ulit ako sa dating app at may nakilala nanaman ako kaso ayun nga kahit may bago akong kausap. Sya pa din talaga yung gusto kong makausap. Hanggang sa dumating yung point na nagstaycation ako sa tagaytay at sya ung naiisip ko na gusto ko pa ding makasama don.

Hindi din ako nagtagal sa bago kong kausap hanggang sa biglaan kong chinat si Cinnamon danish. ""Hi busy ka? I really need a friend, a kausap.""

After nung nag cut sya ng connection sakin hindi na talaga sya nagrereply sa kahit anong message ko. But surprisingly bigla sya nag reply.

""Why what happened?"" pasagot pa lang sana ako bigla naman syang tumawag.

Pagsagot ko kumawala na ung luha sa mata ko. Wala syang ginawa pinakinggan nya lang yung mga rant ko sa buhay. Pilit na pinapakalma at sinasabihang ""wag kang umiyak.""

Sobra ko syang na appreciate that time

Matagal ulit bago nasundan ung convo na un kase nahiya ako bigla sa kanya after non. Haha ewan parang na feel bad ako na isiningit nya pa ako sa 1hr breaktime nya para lang pakinggan ako umiyak.

Hanggang sa eto last month nagkaron ako ng malaking prob sa work at sya at sya ung unang taong nakinig sakin ng walang pag aalinlangan at walang panghuhusga. Pinahiram nya din ako ng money pang start ng new journey at 100% talaga yung emotional, mental at financial support na binigay nya ng walang pag dadalawang isip.

Last 2weeks bigla syang tumawag. Saying that ""namiss ko kase yung boses mo, kamusta ka na ba Burger buns."" bigla nanaman akong nakaramdam ng tuwa at the same time kiligs hahaha kaso short lang ung convo namin non kasi na timing naman na paalis ako at magkakape mag isa. Gusto ko kase ng me time that time. Pag uwi ko ng bahay agad ko naman syang tinawagan kaso di na nya nasagot.

Hanggang eto nung sunday. Nag sscroll ako sa socmeds tas napunta ako sa convo naming dalawa. Nag backread ako from the start so ang haba non haha tas nakaramdam ako ng pagkamiss sa kanya. Kaya sinubukan ko syang tawagan. 10pm na dito sa pinas so 11pm na sa korea. Agad naman nya sinagot pero halatadong nagising lang sya sa ring ng tawag ko. Ang low din kase ng voice nya.

Ayun tamang kamustahan ng mga ganaps sa buhay, para kaming mga batang nagsusumbong ng pagod ng isat isa sa mga kanya kanyang buhay, napag usapan din namin ung biglang pag cut off ng communication namin. And according to him ""Ginawa ko yun kase gusto ko pag uwi ko ng pinas may friendship pa din akong mauuwian.""

Naguluhan ako pero nung naipaliwanag nya naintindihan ko naman.

""Look burger buns, i really like you. Kung andyan lang siguro ako sa pinas, sigurado ako tayo na e. Kaso andito kasi ako. Nung nalaman ko na nahulog ka na din bigla akong napaisip na gusto kita ikeep, gusto ko pag uwi ko ng pinas meron akong ikaw na kikitain ko at magagawa natin ung mga plans natin na place to visit, adventure to experience, foodtrips at kung ano ano pang napag usapan natin. Natatakot ako isugal ung attachment na meron tayo kasi baka pag nag next level tayo di lang mag work e. Pwedeng ako yung magloko or pwedeng ikaw din ang magloko. Ayoko na magkakasakitan tayo kaya ayun mas pinili kong isave yung friendship over don sa Long distance relationship na pwede naman talaga.""

Unti unti ko naman syang naintindihan at nabibilib pa ko sa choice na ginawa nya. Sobrang wholesome lang din talaga ng connections at attachment namin. Ang unique lang ng bond para makita namin ung same color ng mundo.

Na kahit di kami into relationship may friendship kaming pinanghahawakan na every time na need namin ung isa't isa laging andyan naman na handang makinig at handang eextend ung support in all ways.

To my Cinnamon danish,I know we are in our ""Dilaw era"" but i can't help but wonder what it would be like someone's dilaw. To have that special connection, that unique bond with someone who sees the world through similar color.

Thank you for being my crying shoulder when the world gets too heavy. Even when you're far away. Distance has never been easy, but you make it worth it. I can't really wait to finally see you. Mag ingats ikaw palagi dyan, see you very soon malay mo sa pag uwi mo magbukas na din yung Mt. Maculot! 😊 Aakyatin pa natin ng sabay yun e ✨

1q7efs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1q7efs9/was_it_a_buttplug/,Was it a buttplug?,"Hey guys. I am on my 4 year of IBS-M after the surgery where I got a cyst removed from one of my ovaries and subsequently was put on 5 shots of antibiotics during post-operation (horse dose as i was told by a bunch of doctors later on). Obviously my empty head thought i can have a buldak ramen on my 5th day of recovery and so it went...

I tried everything. **Diet, probiotics, herbs, massages, meditation, breathing, essentiall oils, antibiotics, pure aloe juice, coconut oil, black cumin seed oil** (btw, i think rifaximin would always help me the most but never fully bring me to the state of full recovery which chatgpt claims is normal, since i dont have a sibo but rather IBS-M, so it would just alleviate symptoms short-term). Fastforward to 2025 I went through some tests and it stated I'm overall fine apart from the exccessive amount of **Klebsiella**. I took another dose of rifaximin and assumed it should be gone. 

I finally got to the point where I kind of sort of feel good. Only big issues that I was left with were morning subtle gassiness, 2-3 poops a day (which i wanted to be 1), occasional noise from going to the restroom and big but only 1-day lasting flare ups from overindulging. I would have coffee every day and still feel completely fine. Sometimes i could eat whatever i wanted without regretting it but it would always be a short phase that later on would turn into a mildly unpleasant one again. But all of it was bearable. As I said, I got really close to full recovery. But during 4 days of being at my boyfriends after new years eve, I ate whatever I wanted and felt almost amazing. **Odd innit?** 

Saturday we had **sex** and I used a buttplug (sorry for the gruesome details) that was overly big for me to the point I almost screamed and cried. Whatever, right? Sunday was normal. I came back home in the evening and overindulged (as per usual Sunday ritual). Starting from Monday up until present moment (Thursday) I've been in agony. Gassiness, that is hard to tolerate since the gas comes out loudly and in small portions but a lot. Mornings are obviously the worst. Constipation upon awakening followed by mucusy, foamy and loud stools that carry no full emptying. Subsequently I'd sit through the shift at work constantly going to the bathroom and it would be the same story as in the morning. Then after lunch I'd have a loud an explosive poop as if its pushed out with a lot of force all at once, somewhat upset. Not sure what is going on, but funny enough, I'm on my 2 week of no-coffee and trying to eat better and somehow I feel worse. I didn't have these after-lunch urgencies for over a year and it was my worst symptom. Now it's back and I'm utterly confused. 

The reason why I'm saying it is because I'm hoping to get some answers. Maybe some of you had similar experiences, patterns or simply have advises? Please :(

We’re both in therapy and working on our individual issues though! This was my first time in a healthy relationship with someone who genuinely liked me, and it was weirdly hard to navigate 🥲

My ex and I met on Bumble over summer, she broke up with me in November because of her depression and overwhelm (more context on my profile, we’re both women in our mid/late 20s doing postgrad degrees and also both very fearful avoidant when it comes to relationships 🙈).

I texted her last week asking if we could go for coffee or generally talk before we go back to our postgrads. It turned out that she’s extended her trip so she’s still in Australia, but she was happy to talk and offered to FaceTime. I didn’t want to take away from her family time, so we agreed to talk when she’s back in the country in a couple of weeks.

The purpose of this (for me) is to open up about my avoidant behaviour during the relationship (it’s not like I’d shut her down, I just never opened up in return) and to see if we can move forward together with the added context of neither of us being ready for the intensity we had. 

I don’t know if I’ve done this right? And I don’t know how to read if she’s seeing this as closure or not, she was kind and said she hoped I’d had a nice Christmas but no questions or anything (in fairness, I also didn’t ask any questions beyond asking to have a quick chat and she hates texting at the best of times). I’m really panicking, I didn’t expect her to say yes and I’m so insanely stressed  about actually having to be vulnerable even though this is what I wanted 🙈

I had a nice routine in my mornings before work I'd get a solid 1.5hrs in chugging coffee. It's kind of funny cuz my first playthrough took me probably a year as I was playing around once a week. My NG+ playthrough lasted maybe a month. The game really took off for me and became an obsession. 

What do I do now? I bought Hogwarts legacy for my GF cuz she loves HP and I've put like 6hrs into it so far. It's ok but just want to play TW3. Start over again fresh?",5,1767885078.0,Witcher3,22,1.0,False
1q7e9ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1q7e9ic/36m_doesnt_believe_the_mental_load_complaints_of/,36M doesn’t believe the “Mental Load” complaints of 35F wife.,"I’m trying to understand if I am underestimating the mental load burden of my wife or if she is inflating her level of burden. 

I know that many women complain about carrying the hidden mental and emotional load in relationships and my wife is no different in voicing this complaint. A recent example: her family visited over Christmas and after they left she asked me to fold up the futon and clean sheets in guest room. I did not do it until she asked me again the other day. To be clear, she was never going to be the one who did the task as she is pregnant and would not be folding up this futon (it’s quite heavy to operate). Also this room is only used for guests and nothing else. I also do all the laundry so she would never be responsible for it. I simply didn’t do the task earlier because it was low on my priority list. 

What are my priorities you may ask? Here is a snapshot of a regular day:

Early morning: wake up and make coffee and small breakfast for my wife (like egg and toast). Take dogs outside. Wife usually leaves around 6 am for work. I will do other chores in morning typically like dishes or Laundry (I do all of these). 

Morning (before 7:30), wake up toddler, pack her lunch, get her ready for school, drop her off at school (she gets breakfast there), and then drive to work.

After work: pick up toddler, make her snack, try to get any chores done during snack or play with her. Decide on dinner plan. I’m either reheating leftovers or ordering take out. I do all the cooking and will cook on weekends. Wife might be home at 6 pm right in time for dinner but could be home later. I will eat with toddler around 6 no matter what and then reheat dinner for wife while she is on way home. After 7:30, I’ll do bath time with LO and get her ready for bed (PJ’s, milk, brush teeth). Wife will then read with her for 30 mins or so and then I will actually put our toddler to bed around 9 pm. 

On the weekend I take our daughter to gym and swim classes, which we have regularly scheduled but if make ups are needed I schedule on own. If LO doesn’t nap on weekends (common occurrence), I stay up and play with her while wife naps. I also do all doctor appts for LO. If she is sick, I take off and watch her.

So what is this mental burden that my wife takes on? Does she actually have any standing that she is doing unseen work that I don’t see and that I don’t do enough? I’m really asking from a point of curiosity and understanding here. 

Edit: I appreciated all the responses. It’s fair criticism to say I’m downplaying her pregnancy combined with working long hours.

If you have a pug (or any small dog that gets along well with them!) and want to socialize, grab some chai/coffee, and let the dogs cause some chaos together, let’s make it happen. So if you’re nearby and interested, drop a comment or DM me!

If you find yourself in the holy city of Madinah and you’re looking for more than just a quick caffeine fix, you have to check out **Tyam Cafe (تيام كافيه)**. It’s one of those spots that perfectly blends local heritage with a high-end specialty coffee experience.

The Story Behind the Name

What makes Tyam unique is its deep connection to the geography of Madinah. The cafe is named after Mount Tyam, which stands proudly near the historic Mount Uhud. Even their logo tells a story—it’s inspired by a specific flower that blooms on the slopes of Uhud and Tyam during the spring. This flower is a local icon in the Madinah region, and seeing it in their branding adds a beautiful, authentic touch.

The Coffee Craft

For the coffee nerds out there, they don't take shortcuts. Tyam is meticulous about their process:

* **Sourcing:** They are highly selective about the beans they ""pick up,"" ensuring they only work with top-tier crops.
* **Roasting:** They handle their own roasting to bring out the specific profiles of the beans, ensuring every cup—from a flat white to a V60—is fresh and balanced.

The Menu (Don't skip the sweets!)

While the coffee is the star, the food menu is a serious contender. They have a mix of classic French pastry and local fusion:

* **Waffle with Ajwa Dates:** This is a must-try. Using the famous Ajwa dates of Madinah on a crisp waffle is a genius local twist. 🧇🌴
* **Madeleines & Cheesecake:** Their Madeleines are light and airy, and the cheesecake is incredibly creamy.
* **Signature Ice Tea:** If you’re not in the mood for coffee, their Ice Tea is one of the most refreshing drinks in the city, especially given the Madinah heat.

The Vibe

It’s a great place for academics, professionals, or anyone who appreciates a thoughtful, quiet atmosphere. It feels like a space built by people who actually love coffee culture and their city’s history.

YellowSun Coffee: Sadly, it tasted too milky. Not enough coffee.

Headrest Coffee: Very nice coffee flavor and smooth. Nice food options to boot. Will return to test consistency.

rofaqaa: Flat white #1 was exactly what I was looking for, but I returned this morning and a different barista made me a milky dud. :(

Til Death: Experimented with a 4oz cortado and relished the intense coffee flavor. Will return for the 8oz. They don't name their sizes, so I am unsure of how they treat the milk. I'll ask next time.

IC Brooklyn Cafe: The barista gave me the impression espresso was not their passion, asked me what *size* I wanted and subsequently delivered me a cup of hot milk with the ghost of an espresso shot barely haunting it.

Labs so far here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hp8300MxYOUEo\_GjoI1Lfuf6cGI48bTW/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hp8300MxYOUEo_GjoI1Lfuf6cGI48bTW/view?usp=sharing)

Last year in September 2025 I had a normal day and shared a lovely meal with family in Peru. I ate a lot of bread, ham, cheese, avocado, you name it, it was like a brunch but around 7 pm. I had already felt my heart rate was kinda high that day which was weird for me since my heart rate and blood presure are usually low but I attributed it to stress. I go to bed and then jolt out of bed an hour or two into falling sleep feeling like my heart was going to explode out of my chest, it was beating so fast and loud. I basically couldn't sleep the entire night  as I kept trying manuvers to calm my heart and eventually fell asleep out of exhaustion. The morning after, I got my period, so I attributed the episode to it (even though I had never experienced something like that before unless I had had too many coffees or too much to drink). 

Fast forward a month and a half. I move from Peru to Europe to pursue my master's, something I had been looking forward to. I got sick with a bad cold and notice my heart rate elevating here and there randomly and then I start having episodes like the one in Peru again. It happened first after I had a big dinner at around 11 pm. Then same thing again after another big meal. Then it happened after I had a few drinks with a friend. This is insane to me because I have never had issues with drinking alcohol or even eating late dinners. I have always had a big apetite and enjoy occasional partying with friends and never had any issues with overeating or over drinking.

I went to a GP who took my blood pressure and did an EKG after the second bad episode (2 in a week was enough to scare me). Blood pressure slightly low, EKG completely normal. They sent me to get a complete bloodwork (which I am attaching here, sorry it's in German but it's understandable). I see another general doctor to follow up and he said the tachycardia is due to low ferritin (it was 13) and sends me home with a prescription for ferrugradumet tablets. I take them religiously, BUT the episodes keep happening, so after a month I go back to the Dr and he refers me to an internist to get a holter monitor and do a better scan of my heart. He did an EKG, EEG, ECO, and the holter monitor (results attached). He says my heart is healthy and he does observe the sinus tachycardia in the middle of the night in the monitor but says it's normal and sometimes this happens to people and that it is not a danger to me. Also, it should be noted that I triggered the episode by drinking some wine that night (I had cut out alcohol and heavy meals already to avoid bad episodes). Anyways, I beg him for more answers and I tell him that sometimes during the episodes my stomach burns and I feel super gassy and burp a lot and I have to walk around my room to kind of burp more because i feel like there is gas stuck in my chest and I can't bring myself to properly burp it all out. I ask if maybe I should see a gastro and if it could be related to episodes, he says no, and after basically begging for help send me home with a prescription for beta blockers. 

After reading online about beta blockers I decide not to get them. It's been around 3 months of many sleepless nights that are now taking a toll on my mental health. I feel like I can't live a normal life. I am young, I want to go out and drink with my friends, I want to eat mcdonalds at 2 am. I am going insane and I am terrified to go to bed. I have adjusted my life so drastically to avoid episodes and nothing helps. I sleep upright, avoid big meals, avoid alcohol, try to manage stress, and nothing helps. I recently had a conversation with a few friends who are doctos (cardiologist and ENT) and they checked my labs and concluded the same, that my heart is healthy and that maybe it's acid reflux which is triggering my episodes and that is better i stay away from beta blockers.

It's true I have always struggled with tummy issues but I always dismissed it as having a sensitive stomach or maybe IBS, and I didn't think it would be acid reflux bc I don't really feel acid coming out. Anyway, the last doctors/friends told me to take Esomeprazole before bed and that i could also try gaviscon. I did both like some nights the esomeprazole and some others gaviscon and I was sort of fine? but then I got sick this weekend, was diagnosed with tonsilits/pharyngitis and was prescribed Phenoxymethylpenicillin, 500 mg 4 times a day... and these last 3 nights I had mini episodes again but every night. I have a ringconn which tracks my heart rate and the crazy thing now is that my heart rate does not really elevate much, like is around 80 but I wake up with the same sensation of a tachycardia episode. I wake up terrified shortly after falling asleep, I feel like I am sinking and my chest feels heavy, my heartbeat feels too loud and I go into panic. I took gaviscon the last two nights so now I do not know if this is even acid reflux anymore. Also should be noted that mmy ringconn constantly tells me my HRV is usually very low and that is dangerously low during sleep. Also to be noted that my heart rate elevates sometimes during the day after eating meals and the ringconn says im 'stressed'.

I am afraid I am losing my mind because I am not strong enough mentally anymore to navigate the episodes. Now I just get desperate and I want to end it all. It feels like a sense of doom, like I am dying and then I can't go back to sleep. I have noticed my heart rate elevates if I lie down completely during these episodes and If I get up it sort of goes down, so it's awful because I try to go back to sleep and then it happens again and it's a horrible cycle. I am losing my sanity. If anyone knows what's wrong with me please help me. ",1,1767884761.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I say this as someone has has worked in social services in the US for over 10 years, and has lived experience: there are many ways to get food, and very few ways to get money.

Churches and shelters serve meals, there are food banks, social service organizations can help connect people with food stamps, dumpster diving is an option, sometimes restaurants will give out food that they would normally throw out at the end of the day. 

There are things that can only be purchased with money. Like medications, hygiene and first aid items, cold weather gear, a cheap prepaid cell phone plan, use of a laundromat, to name a few. Some people will pay for a cheap gym membership so they can shower. A pair of headphones from a dollar store can vastly improve your quality of life. A night at a motel can give people a break for a bit. Even a few dollars for a cup of coffee gives a person the right to sit indoors for a bit and get out of the cold.

Whether or not you give people money is entirely up to you, but please stop using food as the scale you use to judge how much someone needs help.

Hi Reddit, I, 27 F, have been in a serious relationship with my boyfriend, 30M, for almost 2 years officially. First some context

I was in an abusive relationship that thankfully ended partially because of the pandemic. That man was manipulative, emotionally inept, obsessive, and jealous, liked to play the victim, etc. Think 🍇 + emotional abusive and guilt-tripping asshole.

without giving too much away, the relationship finally ended when, during the pandemic, I decided to buy an apartment for myself in the capital of my country (I'm from latam), he didn't like that and tried to guilt-trip me into backing down (I used only my money, at the time he haven't even graduated college, while I was already working, had a major degree, and was doing my master's), I guess when he tried to take my finantial and professional growth from me, that was the last straw that broke the camel's back.

This context is important, because after that Ex my expectations on men where on the underground, I wanted nothing to do with anyone, and wanted to be alone for a while (if not forever), however, at the same time, I had recently reconected with 3 long time friends due to work, and one of those friends ended up being my current boyfriend.

Like I said, my expectations on men were on the underground, the bar was so freaking low I didn't expected even basic decency from any man, yet, after being 🍇 for so many years with the ex, and not feeling my body like my own, I wanted to recover power, so after I dumped ex, one of those friends (he was single) invited me to his place during valentine's weekend to eat some pizza, playing some videogames, and having some drinks (he was also hurt from a previous relationship, he was about to propose to his ex, and while it wasn't an ugly breakup like mine, he was still griefing that relationship). He told me he got what i was going through. We could drink together and let out all of those emotions about those relationships (he wasn't aware of the abusive extent of my relationship, he just thought I had the usual emotional hangover after a breakup, and wanted to be supportive while seeking company, his words, not mine).

with this I decided to take my chances, wore a mini skirt, a small blouse, heels, all that, and we started drinking and talking, he started asking how I was feeling, trying to be supportive, but I didn't feel bad about the breakup, on the contrary, I felt released, so I avoided the topic, just changed to fun small talk, until between whiskey drinks, I ended up sitting on his lap, he, while kinda surprised, didn't rejected me, and we ended up sleeping together.

We talked about what happened, the emotional state of mind of both of us, we agreed neither was ready, nor wanted a serious relationship, but the sexual chemestry was so good for both of us, that we decided to get into a FWB situation, and we stayed that way for 3 years, doing checkups every once in a while to see if any of us caught feelings (ergo, a sign to stop, take some distance and let the feelings die to resume the friendship) or wanted to persue a seriosu relationship with someone else

Then, on the second year of that FWB relationship, we went on vacation along with our friendgroup, a yearly tradition we created, he and I of course shared a bedroom and we actually arrived first to the vacation place, so we did our thing and then decided to wantch a movie, he feel sleep over my chest, and when I felt the pressure of his body over mine, it gave me a sudden flashback of the 🍇 with my ex, I tried to keep my cool but ended up in a panic attack that woke him up, he was of course, confused, but mostly worried, and I ended up confessing what happened to me, he was a good friend, supported me and consoled my while i calmed down, and that was the moment everything changed for me, I expected disgust, rejection, shame, but he gave me the opposite.

From that moment i started catching feelings without realizing it, and it didn't help the fact that he didn't take advantage of how low my bar on men was, but he actually raised up that bar, always being mindful about how I felt, being patient with my panic attacks, checking on me, reasuring me, letting me be independent without feeling gulthy, etc. Even when I questioned his actions, he would only say things like ""that's what a true men does"" ""you are my friend, of course I care"" and ""this is literally just being a decent human being, nothing special""

Then, when I realized what I was feeling (after a panic attack talking with my bestie, which he carried like a true MVP) I decided to check the terrain, to see if there was any possibility of him having the same feelings, or if I had to end up the FWB thing for both our sakes ultimately. long story short, he is now my boyfriend, so it all worked out lol, so we were FWB for 3 years, and together officially for almost 2

Now with that context, you can see why I love that man so much, he is truly amazing, understanding and supportive, he is super proud of my financial and professional growth and doesn't feel intimidated by it, he doesn't have a problem with a prenup (something myu ex did have a problem with), loves to spoil me and help me out on things i don't understand without being condesending, makes me laugh, we have the same taste in music and hobbies, etc. We overall have a great chemistry after 5 years together (yes, while we were FWB, we agreed we didn't have to be exclusive, but neither was with anyone else lol). 

I currently live in the apartment i brought back in the pandemic, an important part of this context is that one of the things i loved the most about the building complex was it's location, not only is near a mall and has great points for public transportation or just generally driving, it's also pretty close from my parents (15 min walk close), I have a great relationship with them, invite them often, I like to show them the things I've learned to cook since I started living alone, the building I live in has a gym as part of it's ammenities so I go 3 times a week with my mom, it also has a pool and a sauna, which my dad loves, so I invite him constantly to that; I also go to their house constantly, we play games and watch movies there. Like I said, we have overall a great relationship and wouldn't change it for the world!

My boyfriend also has a great relationship with his family, but in his case is his aunt, his grandma, his mom, and his sister (he has never lived with his dad, and it's basically the man of his household)

my BF and I have talked abou twhat we want for the future, we both want kids (min 1, max 2), but also agree that we need to be finantially stable first, we also agree on the kind of big apartment/house we'd like to have, how we would decorate, how we'd divide the house chores, what kind of educational/dicipline methods we'd like to use on kids, etc. Our vision aligns on all of this.

We even talked about starting to live together before getting married, we agreed it was necesary, but I placed one condition: He had to invest on an apartment of his own first; part of the finantial stability we want for a future family, is to have our butts covered in case any of us losses our jobs, while we would still need to budget in that situation, having an extra property or 2 to rent is a way to enssure we would still be able to eat, live, and provide for our kids, and I don't want to be the sole breadwinner, as I am attracted to professionally ambitious driven men, the same way he is attracted to professional driven and competent women, so he agreed, that way, we would both have some sort of financial stability before marriage and before kids. In the meantime, he stays with me on the weekends, as a way to light-test co-habitation. I also placed this condition because I know it's easier to invest/save for a house or apartment while he is living with her mom, because if he were to live with me, we would split expenses, and he would have less money avaliable, he also agreed to this point, and promised me he would invest on 2026.

During this conversation, we also agreed on eventually getting a place close to my parents and his mother and grandmother, a middle point between the two households (this is important, as he is aware of the kind of relationship I have and want to maintain with my parents, and I am aware he is the man of his family, ergo has an important role in his family dinamic and needs to be close)

Now with all this context (sorry, that was super long), here comes the problem: I believe that  we, as the young boyfriend and girlfriend, have to win over our in-laws; I have done my homework and all of my in-laws approve of me, I constantly send home made deserts to my mother in law, chat with his family whenever I'm with them, and make general, friendly conversation, and, as a result she invites me constantly to lunch, coffee, etc.

On the other hand, my boyfriend doesn't do the same thing with my parents, they have invited us to breakfast, lunch, and generally hang out (even spending 2024's christmass and 2025 new year with my family), but he doesn't do conversation with my parents, doesn't try to engage with them, is cold and distant, and doesn't even look at them in the eyes. I asked him why this was, and he just told me he didn't know what to talk about with them, so I gave him a few topics and even common interest between the 3, but nothing changed, I ended up asking if he didn't like my parents, and he assured me that wasn't the case.

Unfortunatly, my parents felt that coldness towards them, told me they feel rejected by my boyfriend, and even though he believed them to be inferior, as they didn't have the opportunity to study and be professionals like us (my dad is a cab driver, didn't even finish highschool because like is complicated, and my mom is a stayed at home mom, before that could only work as a secretary, whiile in contrast, my mother in law has a successfull carrer in a university), I assured them this wasn't the case, however, the damage was already done and they stopped taking initiative of inviting him to hang out.

I talked again with my boyfriend, and even expressed how my parents felt, he initially told me it just wasn't who he was, and even told me how his ex in-laws eventually learned he was the quiet type, but would always take care of their daughter and ended up accepting him because of it, however, I told him it was important for me they had a good relationship, and even explained how I was putting in the effort to win his family over, and I didn't feel that effort reciprocated. This aparently made him reflect and he told me he would try more.

He did! I asked my dad to invite him to dinner during a small local celebration, and he accepted (He was clearly doubtful, but decided to give it a chance), and my boyfriend, while still not super chatty, made small conversation with them, and even gifted them a security camera as an early christmass gift (someone recently broke into their house, and we were planning to travel for christmass, so they were nervious about leaving the house alone), so they were very thankful for the practical gift.

after that we all traveled to a vacational property my parents owned, 3 hours to the city we live in, with a hot climate, pool, bbq, all the vacational stuff. I adopted 2 cats when I started living alone, and my parents have their own two cats, and travelling in the same car with all the bags and the 4 cats was impossible, as my dad's taxi is a very small vehicle, so I asked my boyfriend if he could drive me (I don't have a car and don't know how to drive), and he agreed, and my parents invited him to stay during the weekend.

My BF behaved amazingly, this time he chatted more with my parents (still not a lot, but more than the previous time, so I saw it as progress and effort on his part, which I appreciated and told him as much), even helped out my dad with some small repairs he was doing, bought icream for all of us to share, thanked after every meal and helped my mom by washing the dishes after she cooked us breakfast, lunch and dinner; My parents really liked this attitude and told me as much after he left monday morning, they told me how they still feel unsure about the unbalance on the finantial security we have compared to each other (I'm in the process of buying my second apartment, and already paid of my first apartment being younger than him), but since he doesn't have a problem with a prenup, and promised to invest on 2026, they felt more at ease, admited his attitude improved a lot and were willing to give him a chance if I was truly happy, I thanked them for giving him back the opportunity, aknowledging the effort he is putting in, and assure them they wouldn't regret it. I even texted my boyfriend later, thanking him for the effort he put in, and told him which attitudes my parents liked the most, he seemed receptive to the feedback and even bragged to our friends in the group chat, about how he was ""scoring points with the in-laws like crazy""

fast-forward to new year, and my boyfriend went back to the vacational property of my parents, to both spend new years eve, and to drive me back and my cats to the city, and here's when everything fell apart: all the feedback I gave him? completly forgotten, it was like he decided to do all the contrary of what my parents liked and approved of, he behaved horribly! not only he ignored my parents all new year, but had a cranky look the whole time (which my parents took personally, and I don't blame him, even I felt horrible and felt that he was upset with me), did not lift a dish or a spoon (he literally sat at the table waiting for my parents to pass him his plate, which is very rude in latino households), didn't thanked for any meal provided, didn't even speak with my parents, barely greeted them when he arrived, and didn't thank my father during the delicious new year's dinner (my dad started cooking at 8am, and spent all the day cooking), I whisper him in the table while my parents got up for a second to make conversation with my parents, and he answered me in a horrible and very rude tone ""Don't nag me, what am I going to talk about with them"" (I have no Idea if my dad hear him, as he was off the table but really close), he also dismissed the new year traditions we had, which my mother hated, when midnight arrived, I huged my parents, I hugged him, and he just gave me a small kiss, nothing else, it was so unlike him I felt awful, and in one moment we went downstairs to walk the dinner of, I put him apart for a little and asked him what was wrong, he just dismissed me and told me he had a hard week at work and was tired (I get having a hard week, I get those too, but I have never take it out on him or his family), he then tried to make a small joke between the two of us (trying to defuse the situation I guess), but I was still upset, and told him I didn't want to start the new year by fighting, and that we would talk later after I calmed down (we both have strong personalities and can be very grumpy, so we agreed at the very begining of the relationship that we would never discuss while upset, we would calm down first and then talk it over, this to avoid hurtful comments towards each other)

That night we cuddled to sleep and he told me he loved me and was really comfortable and happy being by my side (like his usual self suddenly returned after an awful attitude the whole day).

The next day he was good as new, back to being chatty with my parents, had an amazing and playful attitude with me (which is how he usually is) and then later when we went to swim in the pool he reassured his promise of investing this year so we could start building our future together, I was happy to have him back, but confussed on the attitude of the previous day, and my parents were even more confused by the change of attitude, they now feel him as fake and a hypocrit, they felt disrespected in their own home (I agree with this)

This is so frustrating! all the progress he made, he ruined it in a day! he gave 1 step forward and 20 back and now the concept my parents have of him is horrible, and I can't even blame them! even I felt disrespected by his attitude, I feel ashamed by him, and now my mom even told me she doesn't want to spend another christmass or new year with him, asked me to consider if I truly wanna be with him, and now they even believe he is tacking advantage of me by staying during the weekends, my dad even told me ""sorry to tell u this, but You're giving him everything easy, he now has a woman that he visits during the weekend, you feed him, and he doesn't even have to pend money on the motel because you're giving him your body for free every week"" which he apologized for how rough it sounded, but that he was also legitimetly worried about me and this relationship.

I haven't talked with my boyfriend yet, as we just got back from the trip last weekend, and I didn't want to discuss while he was driving in the highway (that can be dangerous, and I put our safety first). I plan to talk about it during the weekend, but I don't even know how to bring it up, i am genuenly so confused I don't even know what to do or how to proceed, I'd like to know if I am overreacting to all this situation, I'd like to hear ideas on how to fix it and to try and come up with suggestions to my boyfriends on how to clean this mess and do damage control, as I truly don't want to break up over this, but at the same time, this disrespectful behavior towards me, my family and my traditions can't be ignored and I can't let it pass. How do I go about this?

IMPORTANT NOTES:  
\- my parents don't know about the context of the abuse with my ex, nor the FWB situation, nor how my boyfriend lifted the bar to hard for my standards in men, and i don't plan on ever telling them, (mainly because of the abuse) so giving them this context is off the table  
\- My boyfriend's family doesn't celebrate christmass or new year (weird, i know, specially when all of us are latinos), they don't even wait for midnight, however, I contextualized my boyfriend on what we did during the holidays, and even taught him some of the games we played so we could participate, but of course, with his attitute, there were no games this year

1q7e1yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/1q7e1yv/jackson_meets_lafitte_to_defend_new_orleans/,Jackson Meets Lafitte to defend New Orleans,"Since today is the ""Glorious Eighth of January,"" the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans in 1815, let's talk about one of the interesting backstories to the conflict.

With a Royal Navy squadron in the Gulf of Mexico, Andrew Jackson arrived in New Orleans from Mobile, on 1-December-1814. He immediately established a command center at the main house of the McCarty Plantation in Chalmette. From here, he and his staff developed a plan for the defense of the city. As his staff recruited men to bolster the ranks of local militia units, Jackson knew that seeking help from one group would require a personal touch: the pirates, led by the Lafitte brothers, Jean, Pierre, and Dominique Youx.

[1910s postcard of the \\""Old Absinthe House\\"" on Bourbon Street \(Detroit Publishing Company\)](https://preview.redd.it/fhg88vqf35cg1.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=e455d89235b944f6cab41903efe993b2a31e5b93)

There's no definitive documentation of when and where Jackson meets Lafitte. Two local restaurants whose buildings stood in 1814, claim the distinction. The building currently housing the ""Old Absinthe House"" at 238 Rue Bourbon opened as a grocery store in 1806.. So, their claim to the meeting can't be dismissed out of hand. The second claimant is the building at 440 Rue Chartres, corner Rue St. Louis. The building dates to just after the Great Fire of 1788. A local businessman, Pierre Maspero, operated a coffee house there. Maspero and other commercial brokers met with ship captains, buying and selling goods that came down the river from plantations, then sold to the captains of ocean-going ships heading up the Atlantic coast or across to Europe. By 1814, this trade made Maspero's coffee house quite the busy place.

# Why meet with pirates?

[1939 photo of the Maspero Coffee House \(WPA, photographer unidentified\)](https://preview.redd.it/4vxjf5gk35cg1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=02adcf4f1132e2cd324eeeb167c966bc652abae4)

Major General Jackson was in a bind. His force of less than 3,000 men would have to defend against an attack from the British Army units numbering between 7,000 and 10,000 men. Jackson wasn't in a position to reject help from any source. The Lafittes offered him a very useful asset--artillery gunners.

There were three possible approaches the British could take to approach and attack New Orleans. The first, an advance by ship directly up the Mississippi River, was impractical for them. The river below New Orleans was well-defended by Fort St. Phillip, in present-day Plaquemines Parish. The fort guarded a shallow section of the river that would force ships and boats to move slowly passed. The attackers would be easily picked off by the fort's guns. The second possible approach was from the Gulf of Mexico, to Lake Borgne, through Chef Menteur Pass, then into Lake Pontchartrain. Once in Lake Pontchartrain, the attackers would enter Bayou St. John, travel down the bayou to the Carondelet Canal, and attack the city from Faubourg Treme.

This is where Lafitte's gunners came into play. They were skilled at firing on ships and boats in open water like the lake. Additionally, they knew how to handle ""heated shot."" Shooting cannon balls heated in a furnace at wooden boats inflicted severe damage when fired from a fort. So, with the regular Army and militia units on the river, Jackson could put Lafitte's men on the bayou. That forced the British to land on the shore of Lake Borgne in St. Bernard Parish and march along the river to the city.

# Working out the plan

[Etoile Polaire Lodge No. 1. UNO photo. This is the 1840 lodge building that still stands.](https://preview.redd.it/cl4a4evs35cg1.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21d0707d3b14be22ee39f2deb47636620af30826)

So, where to meet? There are complications with the claims of each claimant to Jackson meets Lafitte. The grocery on Bourbon Street was on the Western side of the city, furthest away from Jackson's headquarters. The pirates were known for doing business at houses and establishments on the lower, Eastern side. Maspero's place was literally across the street from the residence of the city's mayor, Nicholas Girod, and just two blocks from the Cabildo building the city hall, and the Calabozo, the jail. That's a lot of government, military, and cops around. Considering the pirates already had major run-ins with the US Navy, it's hard to imagine they would want to be that close to the law.

# A third possibility

A more likely location for Jackson meets Lafitte is ""on the square."" That's a term used by Freemasons for a meeting where men met under the laws, customs and traditions of Freemasonry. Given that both Jackson and Lafitte were Freemasons and took their vows as such seriously, a Masonic lodge offers a logical location for a meeting. Etoile Polaire (""Polar Star"") Lodge built a meeting hall on N. Rampart Street, just down from Esplanade Avenue, in 1794. This location makes a lot of sense. Jackson could come up from Chalmette easily and Lafitte could emerge from the shadows to work out the details.

(thing to note is that his girlfriend got a kid with him on 30.12.2025. - like few weeks ago and my boyfriend is the godfather.... and to mention my boyfriend told me he wasnt too excited about him being the godfather cuz he doesnt like kids that much)

Towards me he simply never showed that hes happy that his best friend finally found someone that hes happy with where he once even told me that my boyfriend can also come without me or week ago i was at my boyfriends place and we were drinking coffee where the best friend called my boyfriend and via phone kept talking shit about our relationship saying stuff to my boyfriend like when you come alone its all okay but as soon as your boyfriend also comes theres complications etc etc and just basically talking out of his ass cuz me and my boyfriend are together for 3-4 months now and so far i havent heard a single positive thing about me come out of his mouth.

For example the first time i met my boyfriends best friend he made a whole drama because me and my boyfriend watched a movie without him and note it was like one of our first dates together where i asked my boyfriend if we should watch a specific movie together - AND NOTE this was like 30 minutes after i got to meet him, so yea.... Not a really good first impression i would say....

After few times my boyfriend was started getting pissed off at him as well and short after Christmas told him that the way hes been acting towards him and me really wasnt okay and not something hes gonna let slide anymore and that he doesnt wanna completely lose him as a friend which is why he said they need a break otherwise he sees the friendship breaking and coming to an end in the near future.

My boyfriend told me it was a long conversation where at one point the best friend even started crying and told him that he realizes he came off as an asshole and that hes gonna work on himself and that they can keep the break between their friendship but for him to still keep in contact with his girlfriend (since they are also good friends and my boyfriend is the godfather...)

After my boyfriend told me about the break i thought it was definetly something that would give both enough space to think about the friendship and benefit their relationship in the future but I also asked my boyfriend if hes sure cuz of the kid coming and him being the godfather, that it wont be easy - and he told me its all gonna work fine (this convo was a week before the kid was born), that this break is something they need now and if theres anything he needs to know about the kid etc etc that he can always just reach out to the girlfriend of the best friend....

fast forward to now 2-3 weeks later, the kid is already here in meanwhile for more than a week and ever since that convo between my boyfriend and best friend happened i have a feeling that they even keep more in contact now cuz i assume the best friend realized he acted like an asshole towards my boyfriend and my bf isnt putting up with it anymore...

So yea, have a feeling they write more and are more on calls.... my bf just mentioned he talked with him on the phone 2 days ago and stuff like that....

Here comes the part where im not sure if i should adress it or not cuz on one side i understand that his ebst friend got a kid but on the other hand i adressed this exact scenario and he said he doesnt care about anything that this break is something they need right now....
so.... how do I proceed with this?

*Rising geopolitical risk and direct government investment are elevating antimony and gold as strategic assets, creating policy-backed growth opportunities across the critical minerals value chain*

NEW YORK, Jan. 07, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Western world is entering a strategic race to secure domestic supplies of critical minerals, creating a compelling opportunity set for investors focused on resource security and long-term value for active miners that include **Military Metals Corp**. (OTCQB: MILIF) (CSE: MILI), **Perpetua Resources Corp.** (NASDAQ: PPTA) (TSX: PPTA), **United States Antimony Corporation** (NYSE American: UAMY), **MP Materials Corp.** (NYSE: MP), **Critical Metals Corp.** (NASDAQ: CRML). Antimony and gold are moving to the forefront as strategically vital materials: antimony for defense systems, semiconductors, and advanced energy applications, and gold for financial stability, electronics, and secure communications. With global supply highly concentrated outside the U.S. and its allies, these markets are increasingly shaped by geopolitical risk, positioning domestic producers as scarce, strategic assets with growing pricing power. Chinese export restrictions of metals such as antimony have further exposed the vulnerability of Western supply chains, reinforcing the urgency for domestically anchored alternatives. From a market value perspective, critical minerals represent a rapidly expanding investment theme measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars globally, with demand expected to accelerate through the next decade. Gold remains one of the largest and most liquid commodity markets in the world, valued in the trillions with consistent institutional demand, while antimony—though smaller in absolute size—commands premium pricing due to its limited supply base and lack of substitutes in many defense and industrial applications. As supply constraints tighten and governments prioritize secure sourcing, both metals are poised to benefit from structurally higher prices and long-term demand visibility, enhancing project economics for domestic producers. Securing domestic supply from allied jurisdictions has become a cornerstone of this strategy, reinforcing resilience by prioritizing production in politically stable, transparent, and defense-aligned countries.

For investors, the U.S. government’s evolving approach significantly improves the risk-reward profile of domestic critical minerals projects. Direct federal support—through grants, low-cost financing, offtake agreements, and potential equity participation—is reducing capital risk and accelerating development timelines. Complementary policies such as tax incentives, permitting reform, Defense Production Act funding, and strategic stockpiling are creating clearer demand signals and more predictable revenue frameworks. As capital increasingly flows toward assets aligned with national security and supply chain resilience, domestic antimony and gold projects offer investors exposure to policy-backed growth, downside protection, and the potential for premium valuations as strategic scarcity intensifies.

**Military Metals Drills 23.2 Meters of 2.22% Antimony including 7.9 Meters of 4.9% Antimony and 23.2 Meters of 1.27 g/t Gold Including 6.2 Meters of 3.17 g/t Gold at Flagship Trojarová Project** ***-*** Military Metals Corp. (CSE: MILI) (OTCQB: MILIF) (FSE: QN90) (the “Company” or “MILI”), is pleased to report the first analytical results of the Company’s definition drilling campaign at the 100% owned flagship Trojarová Antimony Gold Project (the “Project”) in Slovakia as announced on November 4, 2025. The holes were designed to confirm historical drilling results and to support SLR Consulting’s work towards establishing a current mineral resource estimate on the Project. These priority assay results represent the main mineralized zone from the first hole of the program, 25-TVA-001.

Highlights of the Results from hole 25-TVA-001 Include:

* 23.2 drilled meters (m) of 2.22 % Antimony (Sb) over a true width of 20.1m from 144.3m to 167.5m
   * Including: 7.9m of 4.9% Sb over a true width of 6.8m from 152.7m to 160.6m
* 23.2m of 1.27 g/t Gold (Au) over a true width of 20.1m from 144.3m to 167.5m
   * Including: 6.2m of 3.17 g/t Au over true width of 5.4m from 160.6m to 166.8m

Scott Eldridge, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, “We are thrilled by these first results from the Trojarová Antimony Gold Project confirmation drilling campaign. This validation of the quality and continuity of historical results provides crucial confidence as we proceed with the completion of the project’s first modern Mineral Resource Estimate which is expected to be completed by SLR Consulting this quarter. We are confirming that Trojarová hosts antimony mineralization consistent with earlier work but now supported by contemporary assays. In the context of Europe’s Critical Raw Materials Act, these results underscore Trojarová’s potential to become a strategically important antimony project for the European Union at a time when secure, domestic supply of critical minerals has never been more important. Trojarová stands out as the only known antimony project in Europe with extensive historical drilling that can now be supported by modern drilling and assays. This combination significantly enhances the project’s strategic relevance as the EU works to secure reliable, home-grown supply of critical minerals.”

The Company is working to complete the logging and sampling of the remaining drill core and to expedite the release of complete assay results as quickly as possible. Further details of the complete drill program will be included in future releases as the campaign’s data is verified and finalized including professional location surveys of final drillhole collar locations.

The complete results, (outlined in Table 1 to be viewed in actual [press release](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zf6fnzULYuqxzYbv-FcrhouH7uarvcS1qGQcpbwwLTRtfDE0rZlxvF1FVANke6PnYH6GIuhjgr5RLTXOnSxKgmI1AeRzWTyHvkGAXm5PLEY=)), show a distinct metal zonation within the main zone. Antimony and gold mineralization are consistently present throughout the main zone with a distinct 7.9m interval of Antimony enrichment from 152.7m to 160.6m immediately overlying a 6.2m interval of gold enrichment between 160.6m and 166.8m. Antimony values in the enriched interval range from 0.76% to 12.8%. Gold values in the enriched interval range from 1.26 g/t to 10.45 g/t.

**History of the Project and Historical Resource** \- Discovered nearly fifty years ago, Trojarová was the focus of extensive surface and underground exploration over 2km of strike length between 1983 and 1995, including 63 diamond drillholes totaling 14,330 meters, and 1.7 kilometers of underground workings. Historical exploration efforts culminated in a historical mineral resource estimate published by the Slovak Geological institute in 1992 (see ""Historical Resource Estimates"" in the press release issued today). Per this historical estimate, at a cut-off grade of 1.0% antimony, Trojarová hosts 2.46 million tonnes averaging 2.47% antimony and 0.635 grams per tonne gold in a mineralized zone averaging 3.32 meters wide, containing approximately 60,000 tonnes of antimony in situ.

The historical estimate at Trojarová was classified using the Slovak version of the newly post-Soviet Russian classification system, which uses categories not directly comparable to modern standards as defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy & Petroluem (""CIM"") Definition Standards for Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves. The Slovak Geological Institute, the State agency that carried out all exploration and underground development work at Trojarová, classified the resource as ""P1"" in the Slovak version of the Russian classification system. P1 is most comparable in CIM’s classification system to ""Inferred Mineral Resources,"" which is defined by the CIM as that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence gathered through appropriate sampling techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current, and the Company is not treating the historical estimate as current. For additional information relating to the historical estimate see below under the heading ""Historical Resource Estimates"".

The Company announced January 8th, 2025, that SLR Consulting had been engaged to complete a modern mineral resource estimate of the Trojarová Project. The current drill program supports this work by seeking to confirm historical results and validate preliminary resource models.

Preliminary modelling of historical data indicates the Trojarová deposit may display a trend of thickening and increasing antimony grades to the NW. The Company has targeted projected extensions of the deposit along this vector with 3 of the 7 planned drillholes with the aim to expand the current extents of the known deposit. ***Continued…*** **Read this full release and additional news for Military Metals by visiting:** [https://www.militarymetalscorp.com/news/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ePvKhYeOLKJ7Mgyk3XUqw59labGuefDA4NfrO3aLhpUpzCf8yTeEm9oiAdhQkTBvaRS-DnXB1UesvzDccWw4vvWAR72mR6kq4EgOPVnZnrXc3PLfMPz2AG2tymBABxzSTKclRH4fOXFj2fVmX1aLGw==)

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS AS ALWAYS:

The flood of critical-minerals headlines this week (Perpetua, MP Materials, U.S. Antimony, Military Metals, CRML) underscores one clear reality: **governments are no longer “studying” supply-chain risk — they are funding, contracting, and fast-tracking it.** What separates the winners from the noise is no longer geology alone, but *project maturity*: permitted status, validated metallurgy, financing pathways, and defense-aligned end markets. That’s exactly where NioCorp now sits as it approaches its long-awaited updated DFS.

Unlike many of the projects highlighted — which are still drilling, validating historical resources, or selecting EPCM partners — NioCorp is entering a **dual ramp phase**: (1) mine-level de-risking via a full, modern DFS and (2) downstream strategic relevance through scandium metal, Al-Sc alloys, titanium products, and REEs aligned with DoD, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing. The DFS isn’t just a cost update — it’s the document that converts years of metallurgy, permitting, and federal engagement into something banks, EXIM, and strategic partners can finally underwrite.

What makes this moment different from past cycles is policy. Perpetua is advancing with clear DoD backing, MP Materials is already operating inside a geopolitical framework, and antimony projects are being pulled forward explicitly due to Chinese export controls. **NioCorp fits squarely into this same policy-driven capital funnel**, but with a uniquely integrated profile: niobium + scandium + titanium + REEs, all from one carbonatite, with a bespoke, already-proven flowsheet. Once the DFS lands, NioCorp stops being “a story” and becomes a financeable, defense-relevant industrial asset.

That’s why upcoming 2026 milestones matter *after* the DFS, not before it: ScAl alloy validation with Lockheed, offtake discussions, anchor investors, EXIM/UKREF/German financing, ESIA completion, and early site work. These are not speculative hopes — they are **post-DFS consequences**. The market historically refuses to re-rate projects like NioCorp until that final technical keystone is in place. When it is, valuation frameworks change fast, because the remaining risks become executional, not existential.

**Bottom line:** while many critical-minerals companies are still proving *what they have*, NioCorp is on the verge of proving *how it gets built and paid for*. In a market now dominated by national-security capital, that distinction is everything. **2026 isn’t about hype — it’s about conversion**, and the DFS is the switch that finally turns NioCorp from “potential” into platform.

[NioCorp's Elk Creek mine will produce Niobium, Titanium & TiCl-4, Scandium & ScAl alloys, Terbium, Dysprosium, Neodymium & Praseodymium- SEVEN Critical Minerals on the USGS list with Three \(Nb, Tb, Dy\) in the Top 10!  All to make \\""STUFF\\""! Staying tuned with many... \\""2026 is the YEAR!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1q7dyq5/video/qtemdcda35cg1/player)

She’s also happens to be a bit thick, but not sloppy. She’s had a tough time lately meeting people, so I set her up with a guy I know who has a lot of the same interests. They went out and according to her had a GREAT time. He was very nice and gentlemanly and they clicked almost immediately. They talked and had fun and he never once disrespected her or did anything off putting. Then it comes to the end of the night and he takes her home and she invites him inside for ‘coffee’. She said he got this really sad, sympathetic look and grabbed her hand and patted it and said ‘oh, I am so sorry but I’m just not sexually attracted  to ‘big girls’, but you’re great to hang with.’ For clarity she’s is a bit big but not like TLC show big, but certainly not a fitness model. Now she is devastated. AITA  for setting them up with him without checking if he had a type first?

Edit: so this really blew up. I went over and asked the guy(I work with him, and he said he DID feel a romantic attraction, just not a sexual one. He had an amazing time and thought she was great and would love to go out with her again and even date her. Just not have sex with her. He said he said what he said in the way he said it because he was raised a little old fashioned and taught that a gentleman is honest with his intentions and direct with his delivery and does not lead girls on. He genuinely had a great time with her and wants to see her again and asked if I could talk to her to set up another date but I told him he needed to ask her himself and also do a little explaining to her.

I did workouts, i sat on his chair and even took a nap in there. this place feels better than my own office, matter fact better than my own home. my home sucks. it’s better here. i hope i don’t go home. i take naps in here, love the spot under the desk near his trashcan with paper airplanes and moldy cheesecake. it had a weird smell, I took a bite out of it. it tasted weird, i think i got sick. but it’s comfortable under there, like feels more heavenly than my own bed at home, even better than my office chair. sometimes i use his office phone to order pizzas under his name and card number. one time his bank called and said someone was buying stuff without permission. i said that the person with the card should keep buying stuff. they thought it was a prank so they freeze his savings account. it’s been a week since that incident. he doesn’t know it. I’m trying to convince the boss to give me that room. luckily he said it’s ok. everyone hates him anyways. he hates me also many times. like that one time i hit his car with my Sendal sopper. although i told to pay the damages I hadn’t since. it’s been 2 years since that incident. I did steal some coffee pods from his drawer and couple of snacks, the creamy coffee pod was my favorite, so so so good that I might have to ask where did he get it. his snacks were rancid. it’s just nut mix and chips, potato chips. who wants to eat nut mix in this time around? one time I needed to take a shit so I tried to go to the bathroom. but the plumbing doesn’t work for some reason idk why. somehow a big company like this, with the biggest and greatest technology ever to date, but they can’t maintain a plumbing system for the office building. my 65 year old house with plumbing that hadn’t been replaced for 20 years still works, while they replaced theirs 5 years ago. I originally thought of the idea to shit in the corner of the room. but I didn’t want it to stink there. so I took a bold idea of opening the window and just do my business there sitting on the window sill. it was diarrhea also, not little pebbles. it fell on the sidewalk, parked cars, and even on a stray cat, sorry little one. it had a stream of a waterfall. it kind of looks like a waterfall, but brown, stinky, and a little chunky. ever since boss gave me the office, I have two offices. my old office had a rancid smell of cat pee and bleach. sometimes the office cat sprays on the mop in the supply room which is right next to my old office. my office is smaller than my new one too. i was thinking about just destroying my old office and give it to him. either way he has to take that room. i also kept many of his stuff like the coffee pods, desk, plants etc. i really wanted to keep his computer but boss said that he needs it so i had to give it up. it’s right now 1/8/2026 and he’s angry at everything, at me, boss, co workers, and monogon. im so happy to get his room, i do not regret it. i think this is where ill been sleeping too. get myself a cozy blanket, mattress and pillow and I’ll feel amazing. my story ends here, bye now.",2,1767884095.0,BONELAB,2,1.0,False

Every day feels full in a way that’s hard to explain like I’m finally stepping into something I’ve wanted for a long time. What’s made it even better is being open to sharing it. I’ll check my phone hop on the Pangea app and end up meeting other travelers to explore with or just grab a coffee and talk.

Instead of chasing the next purchase, I started doing something that gives my collection clarity. I gave each bag a nickname and a personality based on how I use her, what she brings to my life, and where she sits in the capsule.

**The rule I set for myself:**

Two syllables + “Girl,” derived from the actual bag name.

**Here’s the current lineup:**

**Puffy Girl - YSL LouLou Puffy (small, beige)**

She’s soft-hearted, warm, and quietly grounding. Prefers cafés, park walks, and unhurried afternoons. Comfort-first, but always pulls an outfit together.

*Horoscope:* Cancer - loyal, gentle, slightly sentimental.

**Carry Girl - LV CarryAll PM (black empriente)**

She’s dependable and practical. Up early, coffee in hand, capable of managing classrooms, groceries, and a to-do list. If she had a job, it would involve clipboards and quiet competence.

*Horoscope:* Capricorn - gets it done without fuss.

**Bee Girl - YSL Bea Tote (Light Musk)**

She’s structured and focused. Thrives on routine and organization. Loves work days, meetings, and structured environments where she can be useful.

*Horoscope:* Virgo - detail-oriented and always prepared.

**Para Girl - BV Parachute (small, black)**

She’s relaxed elegance. Never overdressed, never underdressed. The friend with effortless taste who doesn’t need to try too hard.

*Horoscope:* Libra - balanced, composed, quietly stylish.

**Shopper Girl - Chanel Suede Shopper (brown)**

A little bohemian, a little artistic, she’s easygoing, and happiest wandering weekend markets or gallery halls. Low structure bag, low structure days.

*Horoscope:* Sagittarius - curious, spontaneous, collects stories.

**Classy Girl - Chanel 25 (small, black caviar)**

She’s polished, timeless, and subtly aspirational.

For evenings out, professional moments, or anytime I want to elevate my posture without thinking about it.

*Horoscope:* Leo - confident, poised, enjoys being admired.

**Envy Girl - YSL Envelope (black)**

She’s sleek, compact, and to the point. The “little black dress” of the group. A touch dramatic (by design), and that’s precisely her charm.

*Horoscope:* Scorpio - magnetic, mysterious, impactful.

**Flappy Girl - Celine Triomphe Double Flap**

She’s classic with personality. Versatile, reliable, and quietly interesting once you get to know her.

Moves easily through work days and dinners out.

*Horoscope*: Taurus - grounded, steady, appreciates the finer details.

**Puzzle Girl - Loewe Puzzle (small, vetiver green)**

She’s architectural, modern, and thoughtful. The creative in the group - a little unexpected, but always intentional. She pairs well with everything but never blends into the background.

*Horoscope*: Aquarius - intelligent, distinctive, marches to her own beat.

**Why this worked**

Giving each bag a persona did more for me than any spreadsheet:

\- it clarified what each bag actually contributes

\- it showed me where my capsule already covers everything

\- it helped me rotate more intentionally

\- it took the urgency out of acquiring something new

\- most importantly, it made me enjoy what I own more deeply

It turns out if every bag is already “a girl with a job,” there’s no need to keep hiring.

If you’ve named your bags (or secretly know their personalities), I’d love to hear them.

I am a huge OK story time fan. I have been so conflicted in the last month or two. I have been with my now fiancé, 35M since October 2024. He proposed in early May 2025. He works night shifts from ~8pm-8am and then sleeps til ~4pm. We would make the most of our time together on his days off. During wedding planning I started giving him tasks to do. Like do research on rental suits vs buy for his groomsmen. It would be months and he wouldn’t have done it yet. He would say he doesn’t know how to google and doesn’t know what to ask. Which WHO DOESN’T KNOW HOW TO GOOGLE? So I have been giving this man a step by step on what to Google and had to remind him then none of us know what we are doing since I am the first child to get married. So in the end my mom and I would do the assignments we gave him. After a few instances of this, I started to reflect on his lifestyle and started asking questions. I knew he was tired after work. He worked 5 days a week. So I knew he was constantly tired. But in my head that doesn’t give him an excuse to be in bed and sleep all day everyday. I knew he didn’t cook and would say “I could read instructions and follow a recipe” but hasn’t done one meal aside from breakfast one day. So I am very doubtful that he can cook at all or has ever. One day about a month ago I asked him what vegetables does he eat? The answer is basically none. He eats fast food everyday. No vitamins, no veggies no nothing. I started doing more reflecting he barely goes to a doctor. He doesn’t realize that he has health issues and was completely naive regarding that. Now that I light his ass on fire (figuratively) to see a doctor he finally got meds to help with a health issue he had and his livelihood is a lot better. Then Christmas happens, he got me everything I picked out for me with him. I spent over $100 on this man (I work retail) for Christmas and he did no shopping for me outside what I showed him. The only items he got me for Christmas was a cute ugly Christmas sweater and an ornament of HIS cat. (SUPER happy about that.) He has started helping more with wedding planning. However yesterday I found out he scheduled a meeting with our videographer just to meet with him. When I and my mother told him MULTIPLE times why we needed to meet with the videographer which was to look at areas near the church to take photos and videos for the wedding cause the videographer is from the area and attends the church CB we are getting married at. So it’s almost a waste of time for everyone. anywho between the lack of care for health, not helping with wedding planning and no home skills, I am HIGHLY considering cancelling it and writing off all men. Am I crazy? I could be. He gets me coffee every time we see each other but it’s like he’s incompetent and I’m at my breaking point. He’s really sweet but with all this I think I’m starting to resent him. I can’t marry a man that can’t even live on his own. Or are almost all 20-30 ish year old men like this? I am so lost.

With the machine have to have extra structural support from the inside? How insanely expensive would it be?

Of course the use for this machine would be relatively niche, considering you'd be making about 10 shots at a time, and a few had to make a couple batches to dial in your grind size, you'd be wasting a ton of coffee.

Enjoy !

—

  
The walk to Height's Alliance is uncomfortably silent. Kit is still in its containment—Takata can hear his Quirk's muttering from where it's locked in his backpack, so it was just him and.. *Eraserhead.*

He was still wrapping his head around the fact that this guy was a teacher, let alone a pro. He looked exhausted, and not to mention how *annoyed* he seemed to be about the entire program to begin with. He hasn't so much as given Takata a second glance since they'd gotten out of the HPSC's fancy cars to lead him towards his new temporary housing.

Takata wasn't entirely complaining about the silence, though. It gave him time to look around the walk towards campus, glancing at all of the identical buildings lining each other with the different class labels smacked onto them. UA loomed in the distance, and something dark twisted in Takata's stomach at the thought of going to school again.

Would it be like before? Where Kit was labeled a distraction, he'd be sent to the principal to be disciplined, and Kit would be—

His face bumps into Eraserhead's back, too distracted to notice the hero had stopped in front of their destination. Kit squawks in protest from where it gets jostled in his bag, and Takata quickly takes a step back with a muttered apology.

The man quirks an eyebrow, giving a long sideways glance towards Takata before gesturing with his head towards the dormitory in front of them. ""Villain Rehabilitation Building. There are others already waiting inside.""

Takata glances over towards the building, tilting his head to the side. It looks like every other one next to it, but he knows that it probably is layered in security underneath the harmless exterior. He sighs heavily through his nose, looking over to Eraserhead. ""Thought I was the first person approved for the program?""

Eraserhead exhales, long and slow, as he turns slightly towards Takata. His eyes are sharp, *assessing* as he looks over him—and it makes his skin crawl again. ""You were,"" he deadpans. ""The other participants had more.. *Lenient* overseers.""

Takata tilts his head slightly, raising an eyebrow. ""You mean not everyone had to go through three weeks of interrogation like I did?""

Eraserhead doesn't even blink. ""No.""

The two stare at each other for a long moment before Takata nods slowly, adjusting his backpack with another sigh. "".. Good to know.""

There's another tense moment of silence before Eraserhead turns on his heel and starts walking back the way they'd came. ""Go. Introduce yourself, get settled in. Don't be late tomorrow morning.""

Takata watches his retreating back for a few seconds before steadying himself, moving down the path towards the building. A few steps and the turning of a handle, and Takata peers inside the entrance to his new lodgings.

The first thing he's met with is a blast of warm air—a nice contrast to the chill outside. The second is the gathering of a few people sitting scattered among a few chairs and couching littering what seems to be some sort of open common living space.

As Takata steps inside, slowly toeing off his shoes, one of the figures lifts his head to observe him. He's lounging lazily back against one of the couches, feet kicked up on the coffee table in front of him with a notebook and pencil on his hands.. Or, rather, *claws*, Takata notes as he walks closer. Although that's hardly the first thing to notice about the other boy—he has long, jagged horns sprouting from dusty gray hair with soft rose fringes. A long, thin tail with a sharp tip is flicking lazily next to him.

As Takata meets his eyes, he smiles—showing sharp teeth with prominent fangs and an *infuriatingly* smug smile. ""Fresh meat already, huh?""

From beside him, a smaller girl with long, messy orange hair huffs softly. She was watching whatever the first boy was doing in his sketchbook before he'd set it down, and as Takata approaches she adjusts a bulky collar around her neck. ""Fresh meat, *really?* You're gonna scare him.""

The demon boy grins wider, twirling his pencil in his fingers. ""Ohh, *wolfie,* I *sincerely* doubt anyone who steps foot into this building will be scared off *that* easy.""

The girl shoots the boy a *look*—clearly unimpressed by the nickname—before turning towards Takata. ""Welcome in, I'm Hayashi Roku."" She taps her fingers against the collar again—seemingly a nervous tic. ""Nice to meet you""

""Arata Akamitsu,"" the other boy chimes in lazily, offering a two-fingered salute. ""Sitting in the corner over there,"" he gestures with his pencil towards a girl who Takata had *not* noticed staring at them the entire time, ""Is Yoriko Arai. Don't take it personally if she doesn't talk to 'ya—they kinda have a *thing* in her throat right now until they figure out how to deal with her Quirk."" He waggles his fingers in her direction.

Takata's gaze flicks over to Yoriko, who's almost entirely buried under a blanket in the crook of one of the chairs. She offers a small, timid wave, her gaze flicking uncertainty between the three of them. When Arata grins, winking at her she stiffens before turning away—her cheeks flushing. *Just shy,* Takata thinks to himself before turning back towards the other two. ""Takata Kisho. Is.. This everyone?""

Arata hums, nodding as he stretches back against the couch, arching his back like a cat with his arms raised above his head. ""All but one. You may or may not meet Kairi—she's a bit of a recluse. A cutie for sure, but she's more timid than that one over there."" He nods to Yoriko, who hasn't moved from her small bundle of blankets she'd retreated under.

Hayashi rolls her eyes, leaning back against the couch. ""She's not a *recluse*. She's afraid of hurting people until they figure out support gear for her.""

Takata nods slowly, carefully shrugging off his backpack and placing it on the coffee table. ""I have a feeling that'll be a theme,"" he murmurs as he pulls out the small cage from his bag.

Almost *immediately* Kit wraps its paws around the bars, its forehead pressing firmly against the cage. ""***TAKA!*** *Finally!* I thought you were going to leave me in here *forever—!""*

Arata blinks in surprise, leaning forward in his seat to get a better look at the small cage. ""Woah, newbie, you got to bring a pet?""

Kit *immediately* whirls around, ears flattening in offense as Takata flicks open the keypad on the side. ""*Excuse me!?* I'm not a—""

""This is Kit,"" Takata cuts in, inputting the combination with deft fingers. ""It's my Quirk."" The cage's top opens with an audible *click*, and Takata sighs wearily as he looks up to Arata with an exhausted expression. "".. Please don't antagonize it, *I'm* the one who has to put up with the aftermath.""

Kit launches itself out of the cage, zipping over to Arata with its paws on its hips. Arata grins lazily up at it as it scowls back at him. ""Wow, sentient Quirk, huh? Sounds fun.""

Takata shoves the cage back into his bag with a snort. ""That's a word for it.""

[Sage Barista Express, Comandante w Red Clix]","I've had a barista express for a few weeks. I managed to dial in 1 bag. Then I got a new bag. Since then, the machine...chokes ?   

Well, espresso does come out. But after a while, near the end of extraction (around 25 seconds), the pressure goes up, water comes out from the top of the portafilter and all goes to hell. 

Either way the coffee is too coarse and espresso comes out in 20-25 seconds, too acidic, or it does this if I go finer. 

I'm always going 16:32 with WDT and a normcore tamper, always the same pressure.

I've tried different grinds (I'm using comandante with red clix), using the range that worked with that previous bag from the same roaster. From 12 to 9 clicks (with red clix) it's too coarse and the espresso comes out too quickly (18-23 seconds). Under 9 clicks, it chokes. With my previous bag, 8-10 clicks was perfect. 

Current bag was 1 week off roast when I started dialing in. Now it's 3 weeks off roast.

I guess my questions are :  

\- is this what people call choking ? I thought it meant grind is too fine and coffee doesn't come out at all  

\- how can I solve this ? Is this from the grind or the machine or something else ?

1q7dldo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Shop/comments/1q7dldo/anyone_here_tried_touch_coffee_automated_coffee/,Anyone here tried Touch Coffee (automated coffee bars)? Legit or overhyped?,"So I keep seeing these Touch Coffee machines popping up in offices, condos, gyms, and even some airports. It’s basically a fully automated barista machine that makes espresso drinks, cappuccinos, lattes, etc., without staff.

I went down a rabbit hole and here’s what I’ve found so far, plus my honest thoughts.

What it is (from what I understand):

* Smart coffee bar with a touchscreen  
* Uses real beans and milk powder 
* 20–30 drink options  
* No barista, no tips, no staff needed
* Mostly placed in high-traffic locations (offices, residential buildings, clinics, gyms)  

What intrigued me:

* Machines run 24/7  
* Margins seem decent once placement is good  
* No payroll, no training, no “someone called in sick” stress  
* Looks way more premium than old vending machines  

But here’s where I’m skeptical:

* Upfront cost is not cheap  
* Placement seems to be EVERYTHING. Bad location = dead machine  
* Coffee snobs will obviously say “this isn’t a real coffee”  
* Maintenance and restocking still matters more than people admit  

Taste-wise:

Honestly? It’s better than I expected. Not third-wave hipster café level, but way better than Keurig, Nespresso, or gas-station coffee. For an office or condo, it’s a big upgrade.

Business model questions I still have:

* How consistent is daily volume per machine?  
* How much time does restocking actually take per week?  
* What % of locations fail or underperform?  
* Is this more passive income or “semi-passive but still annoying”?  

Who I think this is perfect for:

* Someone who already has access to locations  
* People tired of service businesses with staff  
* Operators who like systems and logistics  
* Anyone who wants recurring revenue without opening a café  

Who should probably avoid it:

* People expecting “set it and forget it”  
* Anyone without strong placement or sales skills  
* Coffee purists trying to build a brand story  
* Anyone allergic to operations and maintenance  

I’m not affiliated (yet), just genuinely curious and doing research.

Would love to hear from:

* Anyone who owns one  
* Anyone who’s tried and failed  
* Anyone who’s placed these in offices or condos  

Is this the future of coffee in non-retail spaces, or just a fancy vending machine with good marketing?

TL;DR:

This is the clear gasket that sits way down in the underside of the Flex Sip lid, not the red one you remove during cleaning.

The clear gasket falls out when removing the lid for cleaning. Often I don't know it's fallen out until my husband or I find it in the sink. In the case of the Oat 16 oz above, I unscrewed the lid to make coffee and the clear gasket was stuck to the top as seen in the photo.

  
This issue has occurred with all of my recent Hydro Flasks: Trillium, Aloe, Oat (20 oz and 16 oz), and Moonshadow.

I've been using Hydro Flasks for at least a decade or more. My original Hydro Flasks (Wide Mouth) had the flip top lid; more recently, the screw top with the handle. I've never had this issue until these recent releases.

I contacted Hydro Flask and sent photos and a video of the issue. They sent me three new Flex Sip lids to replace the ones that came with the Trillium, Aloe, and Oat flasks, but the new lids they sent did the same thing.

After some more back and forth, their response was: 

>""We have not had other reported issues of this happening and there have been no reported changes with the manufacturing of our gaskets."" 

So I came here to see if anyone else might be experiencing this issue.

I take fluoxetine, I’m on a three month medicine for toenail fungus called Terbinafine, I take vitamin d supplements. I also take a HIMS supplement blend (tadalafil, zinc sulfate, L-Arginine, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12.) Lately I’ve started taking magnesium glycinate (120mg) before bed. 


So, the past week - every time I’ve went to the bathroom I’ve noticed my urine has smelled very “nutty” pretty much like peanuts. Now I know coffee/caffeine messes with my urine smell when I drink it, but I haven’t drank any since a week ago. The only new thing in my diet/medication is that I’m taking magnesium glycinate at night.  Not sure what this could be, any insight is appreciated. Thanks!

By recent, it’s been a little over one month. And I’ve used ubereats countless times since at my new address. I even ordered the night before the incident with zero issues. 

Anyway, I was out of coffee and feeling lazy so I decided to order breakfast from McDonald’s. It was on the homepage as an option and so I clicked on it, placed my order and started my day. 

The order arrives and the courier is apparently at the door. Except they aren’t there, they’re at my old address. I’m cursing myself because I’m thinking how could I be so stupid. But then as I start to think about it, I begin to wonder how it even happened. I ordered from the correct address. The app has access to my location. But somehow I was recommended a restaurant 1.5 hours away?

So I go to ask for a refund because this is clearly an issue with the app, right? Because, like I said earlier, I’ve ordered from my new address several times with no issues. Not once since I moved has the app suggested a restaurant near my old address. 

Well, Uber decided that actually this is my fault for not checking the address before placing my order. Which, okay fair, I should have. But why didn’t the app warn me? Why did it suggest that McDonald’s in the first place? I’m still blown away at how this even happened.

Uber refusing to refund me the $30 after being a longtime loyal uber eats customer was the sign I needed to cancel my uber one membership and delete my account.

I (5’5”) started Zep in Nov 2024 at 212lbs. The first pic in shorts is two years before that at my highest weight at 230. That pic was actually my 31st birthday. I was so unhealthy. Miserable. Hated my job. I had two roommates who hated each other so I was constantly referee in my home. I had gained so much weight I could barely walk long distances, let alone workout. I ate constantly to fill a void of sadness and boredom.

(Second is July 2025 and last one is today)

2024 leading up to the choice to do Zep was still hard but things got better. New job (I’m still at) is a good job. I moved in with my now fiancé (who’s been with me since 2019 so any size- I love him so much). Could not kick the eating habits. Tried to work out but would get so tired. My best friend of 13 years, my cat, died pretty suddenly in Nov 2023 and it sent me into a deep deep spiraling depression. 

I got so tired of feeling bad for myself and I hate asking for help but I thought. F**k it I’ve tried everything else and if this doesn’t work at least I tried it.

I’ve lost 77 lbs but here is what I’ve gained:
- Self confidence
- Impulse control
- Loving my body for what she does. She walks, she stretches, she dances.. she can still get low to Lil Jon which is actually insane
- A life not surrounded by “what am I going to eat next” “when am I going to eat next” “I can’t believe I just ate all that”
- A better relationship with everyone around me due to no comparisons

I’m not saying zep automatically made me a better, happy person. I have depression in general but I’m very sunshine, drive with the windows down blasting good music with an ice coffee in my hand person. But I lost that girl for a long long looooong time and gave up on it. And zep helped take one big weight (lol) off my shoulders so I could shift some of my focus into finding myself again.

Don’t know if Wegovy will work or not work on top of the work I do myself. But I am so happy I went to the doctor in Nov 2024 and finally got over my fears and asked for help.

That day hit me like a punch in the gut.

 

I'm sitting in my Mumbai apartment, fan whirring overhead, the smell of coffee still lingering from breakfast, staring at my laptop screen.

 

As I observed my potential client’s post on r/SaaS, it had just 3 upvotes.

I thought there was some sort of lag.

 

Then I refreshed the subreddit and observed something even more shocking: their direct competitor's post had 2,000 upvotes.

 

It was the same day.

 

It was the same community.

 

But strikingly different results.

 

Looking at their face, I could almost sense the disappointment rising.

 

Then we decided to reverse engineer, the competitor’s post.

 

And this is what we found:

 

Their post title: ""How I automated customer onboarding in 10 minutes.""

 

My potential client’s post title: ""Excited to share our new automation tool!""

 

What do you think could have gone wrong here?

 

It wasn’t a completely salesy post.

 

And still, the result was equivalent to a difference between 2 galaxies.

 

My potential client was furious, roaming the room, muttering words (can’t be mentioned here), feeling that familiar sting of being outplayed again.

 

That’s when we forced ourselves to read the comments on competitor’s post.

 

47 people were asking, ""Dude, what tool did you use?"" He just dropped casual replies with his product link.

 

That’s when we realised that Reddit limited my potential client’s post because it didn’t add any value.

 

While rewarded the competitor for adding pure value through his engaging post.

 

That’s when we decided on our next content strategy.

(and of-course, I did sip my coffee at this point)

 

The results were something we were confidently hopeful about: ""The 3 onboarding emails that tripled our activation rate.""

 

No product is mentioned anywhere in the main post.

 

We just shared the exact email sequence and screenshots.

 

The next thing we saw with smiling faces:

\> Our post had 891 upvotes.

\> 34 DMs flooding in.

\> 8 paid customers by the end of the week.

 

The difference was the post's archetype.

 

We started being the friend the Redditors can resonate with, and not a sales guy.

 

Note: Reddit doesn’t hate promotion. It hates sellers.

 

Be the guy sharing wins, not the guy pushing links.

My biggest issue is gut health, always bloated with stomach pains, gassy, just never feeling well but most people when they see me assume I'm as healthy as can be when I feel the exact opposite.

  
My diet is shit and I know it, when it gets bad I complain to my fiancé and she'll ask what I ate and she'll have this look of like ""are you f'ing with me, anybody would feel terrible with that!""  In my mind its not bad but when I write it out I'm just like well damn.

My typical cycle is to cut out coffee and dairy (lactose intolerant) but I LOVE a bagel with cream cheese and coffee in the morning, and whatever unhealthy food I've been gorging on, start to feel better, have it again and realize I feel ok from it, then gorge again until I feel like I'm dying 🤷‍♂️

To make this longer than it needs to be, fast forward to this past holiday season, sugar, alcohol, fatty food galore and sure as hell, by New Years I'm hurting.  My sister in law challenged me to dry January and I decided it would be best to finally cut this vicious cycle.

I realize my mistakes after finding this sub - I went too hard too fast.  It seemed simple enough, no more sweets, keep added sugars below 25g, cut out refined carbs, and eat real food (my previous ""cleanups"" were just stopping the chips and other crappy snacks but still eating processed carbs).  All week I've made whole foods for every meal, drank lots of water, lots of fruits and veggies.  

Sounds good but its terrible 🤣.  My gut hates me, really bloated, stomach pain off and on, no real sugar cravings (especially those after meal must eat all the desert cravings), anxiety is through the roof, and at one point I thought i was having a mental breakdown (which brought me to this sub).  I do realize my salt intake is also low, had some cheese and added some salt to my protein smoothie and feel a bit better already.

On the positives - my sleep has already improved, since stopping sugars I'm not waking up 3-4 times a night.  My acid reflux has lessened by alot (waiting on the bloating to subside), and I have more sustained energy and not crashing throughout the day.

I figured I made it this far, its only going to get better and looking forward to a healthy and happy new year!

* Physical: My left arm often starts trembling or feels like ""ants are biting"" (tingling/numbness).
* Mental**:** I get sudden waves of irritability and tension.
* Cognitive**:** Severe brain fog. I can't think clearly or make fast decisions, which is a huge problem in my role.

I believe there are numerous homages to Twin Peaks in this show which may be deliberate, while others could be coincidental, but taken together they’re hard to ignore.
Below is a list of connections I noticed (Twin Peaks spoilers below).

Casting Kyle MacLachlan and having him appear in a coffee related scene with the same expression is obvious. 

There’s a striking visual parallel between Hank (Kyle) looking at himself in a bathroom mirror above a sink as he comes to terms with what he has done and Dale Cooper’s doppelganger doing the same in Twin Peaks, where Cooper (Kyle) confronts the evil now residing within him after being possessed by BOB.


Several character names also seem potentially linked:

Cooper Howard (Dale Cooper)

Janey (Janey-E)

Norm (Norma Jennings)

Chet (Chet Desmond)

Lucy (Lucy Moran)

Hank (Hank Jennings)

Betty (Betty Briggs)

Overseer Ben (Ben Horne)


Additionally, Stephanie’s eye patch and aggressive personality strongly recall Nadine Hurley.


For the future...
It will be interesting to see whether Cooper Howard follows a path similar to Dale Cooper’s. While Dale is a detective, Cooper Howard is also portrayed as playing a detective role. As he digs deeper into Vault-Tec and other shadowy systems, it’s possible a chain of events could unfold similar to Dale’s experience in the Red Room. Entering with imperfect courage and becoming overtaken by his shadow self. Cooper Howard may yet face a comparable transformation later in the series.

Everyone told me I’d be bored.
Everyone worried for me.
What was I going to do with all that time?

I understand the concern now.
For a lot of people, time only makes sense when it’s structured by work and responsibilities.

Without that structure, it can feel unsettling.
What I’ve learned is that time doesn’t need to be filled.  It just needs to be lived.

Now I do the things I love. Every day. I'm warm climates. Trying on many different places, communities and lifestyles.

I love music. I carry it with me, but I also seek it out.

Local musicians. Sitting on a patio in the sun, listening without watching the clock. Lunch doesn’t come with a countdown anymore.

If I linger, it’s because the moment is worth lingering in. Lunch turns into window shopping, a few errands, or meeting a friend. Nothing needs to be finished by a certain hour.

I love motorcycling. I love snorkeling. I love street art discover walks and photography.

Some days are active. Some days are slow.
Yesterday was a scooter ride, a workout at the gym, lingering over an iced coffee and an easy conversation with my husband.

Making our own meals is key. We limit eating out to social occasions.

We ended the day with a night snorkel — bioluminescence in the water, sea turtles, eels, octopus.

I’m healthier now than when I was working.
I move more. I feel better. Life feels quieter, but more present.

Retirement, I’ve found, isn’t about filling time.
It’s about releasing it.

We travel 6 months of the year. Slow living, lifestyle rich. Our budget is modest. We are frugal so we can afford to travel. 

Happy Canadians escaping the harsh winters. They made me SAD. Disconnected from friends and family. Winters for me we're very isolating. Now we are living our best lives!!",1,1767882642.0,u_Red_FlowerKitty,0,1.0,False

When i first  moved from instant to specialty coffee, i didnt know the grounds to water ratio. So when i bought the blue tokai medium dark coffee, it tasted bland because i was using very less. Then i started buying the dark roast and it tastes good by my measurement, so i thought that i like only dark roast coffee. And i have done this for 6 months now. Then i discovered James Hoffmann and get to know the water to grounds ratio which is 15-18 grams of coffee per 300 ml of water. Now , today i have bought the dark french roast from Farmers and Maverick. And now i have put the correct amount which is 15 grams of coffee per 300 ml of water and tastes beyond bitter, it was so strong. I got through it tho.

I work around IT Park and most days the commute feels… a little too boring when done solo. So thought I’d put this out here.

If you’re someone who goes to IT Park or anywhere nearby, and you also commute alone and get bored or maybe you just wanna join, maybe we could ride together or you can hop up with me. I’ve got a bike, so it’s easy to hop around, save some time, and make the daily routine a bit less dull.
Just genuinely looking to meet new people and make a friend or two. Most of my college friends have either left Dehradun or are caught up in their own schedules, so yeah…
