Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1761934698.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

I was a fresh-faced PM, barely a year into my first 'real' product job. My baby was a massive new feature we’d hyped for months. Marketing had the slick campaigns ready to go, the VPs were already patting themselves on the back in meetings, and the pressure was on.

About a week before launch, our lead engineer, a grizzled veteran who communicated mainly through grunts and pull requests, cornered me in the kitchen. 'It's not ready,' he said, staring into his coffee like it held the secrets of the universe. 'The foundation is shaky. It'll work for the demo, but it won't survive in the wild.' I heard him, but I didn't *listen*. I was blinded by the roadmap, the deadlines, and the pressure from above. I told him we had to launch and deal with the 'minor bugs' as they came up.

The day of the launch felt like a movie premiere. We were all huddled around a monitor watching the real-time usage stats. For the first five minutes, it was glorious. The numbers ticked up. People were using it! Then, the first Slack message hit our support channel. Then another. And another. It wasn't a trickle; it was a flood. The feature wasn't just buggy; it was actively corrupting user data. The whole site started groaning under the strain. We had built a beautiful, gleaming sports car on a chassis made of popsicle sticks and glue.

Making the call to roll it back was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. It felt like a personal failure. The team was demoralized, my boss was furious, and I spent the night convinced I’d be fired. But the next morning, we huddled up, no finger-pointing, just a shared mission: fix it. For two straight weeks, fueled by pizza and a humbling sense of purpose, we rebuilt the foundation. We relaunched quietly, with no fanfare. And it worked. Perfectly. It quickly became one of our most beloved features.

That disaster was the best thing that ever happened to my career. It taught me that my primary job isn't to ship features; it's to manage risk. It taught me to trust the quiet engineer in the corner over the loud executive in the boardroom. And it taught me that sometimes, the bravest product decision you can make is to have the courage to wait.

I have a limit on my caffeine intake. I also have unmedicated ADHD, for the same reason I can't have a lot of caffeine. So usually I'll brew a half-caf in my French press, or a decaf when I'm really just not feeling like risking it.

My problem is that most grocery stores will have coffee that looks really good, OR decaf that looks good, but never the same brand that provides both. And if I'm mixing them for half-caf it's pretty important that they're the same coffee.

It was only $28 but it hit me way harder than it should have. I thanked her about ten times, and she just smiled and left.

1ol2032,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1ol2032/wax_on_the_mantle/,Wax on the Mantle,"I washed the last of the cocktail glasses and let them dry by the sink,  
my hand hovering over the dishtowel first,  
as grenadine residue drips from the glass.  
The morning’s already half over;  
the room is dark except the light  
that leaks in sideways through the blinds.  
I open the curtains and let the daylight in.  

There are scattered papers all over the window seat,  
I haven’t written an un-plain syllable in days.  
Last night I sat by the window pouring line after line,  
watching streetlights flicker on, one after the other.  
The sun rose again.  
I mutter “fuck” under my breath  
as the light in the room has moved  
but I, somehow, have not.  

The paper basket swallows every balled-up page,  
overflowing with words unsaid.  
The house is quiet, except it’s not.  
The walls scream.  

I run my finger along the countertop,  
nails scraping through the film of dust  
forming around the calendar.  
My eyes graze a date circled,  
I let an anniversary go by without a word.  
My stomach knots.  
I want to flip the page over,  
but I freeze—  
my hands trace the teeth that bit  
the quivering tongue that remembers  
what my own iron tastes like.  

It’s easier to count the things I haven’t done  
than what I have.  

I open the window and the city’s noise filters in.  
The sea breeze wafts in.  
The dust doesn’t move.  
My phone buzzes in my pocket.  
I check it. Not you.  
Just another alert, a bill due,  
something else that wants my attention.  
I ignore it, except I can’t.  
I sigh, pocketing it, and turn back to the kitchen.  

I open the cupboard, close it again.  
Not hungry.  
My stomach backflips  
with that sickening feeling  
that comes too long after the fact.  

I’m mid-reach for a mug when my hand trembles  
and the mug falls to the counter,  
chipping the handle.  
I think about the angle of my hands  
reaching for the mug  
and the air quivers with the wrong words.  
I think about the mug’s weight in my hands.  
A high-pitched ringing rips through the tiles  
as I also drop a spoon.  
It echoes throughout the screaming walls.  
My vision blurs.  

“Enough,” I say,  
but there’s no one here to hear it.  
The room doesn’t answer.  
I stand, hands braced on the counter,  
the fog lingers, my ears ringing.  
I step back from the counter,  
catching my breath in the narrow hallway,  
scuffed baseboards holding their own temperature.  
I pass the wall clock, its tick indifferent.  
I rip it off the wall, whispering, “It’s your fault.”  
The clock lands facedown on the floorboards.  
The ticking doesn’t stop.  
Its laughter presses into the grain.  

I go to the bedroom.  
Your shirt is still on the end of the bed where you left it.  
I pick it up, gently folding it to my chest,  
before hanging it back up in the cupboard,  
the latch clicking as I close the door.  
My hand lingers on the handle.  
“It is safe,” I whisper to myself  
as I sit on the edge of the bed,  
exhaling, hands pressed to my brow,  
sticky under my fingers with last night’s foundation.  

I get up and remove last night’s smeared makeup,  
watching charcoal rings bleed into water.  
I look into the mirror while I remove the visage,  
my bare reflection staring at me, and I do not look away  
until my face is washed and dried,  
and the towel is hung back on the rack.  

The hallway is longer on the way back,  
the facedown clock echoing through the floorboards  
as my eyes gaze upward, tracing the hairline cracks  
branching from one corner, spidering horizontally,  
one crossing through the others.  
My footsteps follow the lines to the corner  
where the hallway opens back to the lounge.  
The candle from the night we signed the lease,  
while toasting with champagne in coffee mugs,  
still sits above the fireplace, wax pooled on the mantle.  
I run my finger through the wax, a smile tugging at the curve of my lips,  
warmth spreading through my chest, leaving the wax there.  
It stays because I do.  

I check my phone and see your message: “Still ok for lunch?”  
I grab my bag from the counter, typing, “I’m running late. Again. I’m sorry,”  
my shoes are leaning by the door. I put them on and step outside.

If you're googling ""get ex girlfriend back"" at 2 AM (guilty as charged), you're not alone – I did too, desperate for that one text that'd fix the ""space"" bomb she dropped. Spoiler: Begging flopped hard (blocks, silence, shame spiral). But 6 months of real no contact? She reached out, changed, and we talked – though I chose me first. The hard truth: Getting her back isn't about tricks; it's about becoming the guy she can't ignore. Here's what worked (and what didn't) from my mess.

**Step 1: Full No Contact – Your Power Move, Not Hers**  
Cut all lines – no ""checking in"" texts, no social peeks. It's not punishment; it's space to grieve and grow. I lasted 30 days before the itch hit, but pushing to 90? Magic. Why? It flips the dynamic – she sees your absence as strength, not weakness (psych backs it: scarcity boosts value). Pro tip: Delete her number; use a ""why list"" (her red flags) for weak moments.

**Step 2: Self-Upgrade – Become Unmissable**  
Exes return to the upgraded you, not the broken one. I hit walks (endorphins > rumination), therapy (unpacked my chase fears), and hobbies (woodworking turned isolation into flow). Track wins daily – ""crushed a project"" beats ""missed her laugh."" Result? When she pinged, I was steady, not starving. Your glow-up screams ""I don't need you"" – the ultimate pull.

**Step 3: If She Reaches Out, Vet the Vibe**  
She did at month 6 (rebound crash). Don't jump – ask: Is she owning her part? Therapy? Real change? I set boundaries: ""Show me actions, not words."" If it's crumbs, walk. If it's mutual growth? Test with coffee, not commitment. 70% of reconciliations fail without this (stats from breakup forums – patterns don't lie).

The myth? ""No contact guarantees she'll beg."" Nah – it guarantees *you* win, back or not. I chose forward (happily married now), but if it's her, you'll know because you're whole. You're not ""getting her back"" – you're getting *you* back first.

What's your biggest ""get ex back"" myth you're busting today? Share – let's swap real wins.

**TL;DR:** To get ex girlfriend back: 90-day no contact for reset, self-upgrade to unmissable, vet her return with boundaries. It's for you first – works if mutual.

One step stronger – thanks for this sub.",1,1761934430.0,TheAttractionSignal,0,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond..

But the truth is… it doesn’t happen in one big leap.

>

Maybe that decision is to get out of bed on time.  
Maybe it’s to drink water before coffee.  
Maybe it’s to open your notebook and write one line.

That’s where consistency begins — not in massive effort, but in small daily promises kept to yourself.

I used to think I needed motivation to get started. Now I know I just need movement — even tiny movement.  
Because every small action builds momentum.  
And every time you show up, even when it’s hard, you build trust with yourself.

That’s how progress grows — quietly, one day at a time.

To make it easier to stay consistent, I’ve shared a **free habit tracker** I built for myself.  
It’s simple but powerful — it helps you see those tiny wins stacking up even when you feel stuck.  
(You can find it in my profile if you want to use it.)

So here’s the challenge:  
Pick one small action. One step. One promise to yourself.  
Start today — and keep showing up.

1ol1p1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ol1p1t/oocs_of_dog_volpir_and_man_bk_8_ch_51/,"OOCS: Of Dog, Volpir, and Man - Bk 8 Ch 51","Cayenne

The original plan for her first (second?) date with Scotty Le Fae had started fairly simply. Skewers and drinks. A nice night at the Cannidor eatery on the ship, considered top tier casual dining for those who enjoyed animal protein in their diets. Over the following days of texting, one random per chance meeting in the hallway and an impromptu coffee together, it had turned into something a bit more... exciting. 

Scotty had invited her to go flying with him before dinner, and she’d said yes! 

Once she realized what she’d agreed to, Cayenne had asked what she was supposed to wear for going flying, and Scotty decided instead of just having her wear normal clothing, perfectly safe in a shuttle like they were going flying in today, he'd have the girls in Aircrew Flight Equipment get her suited up with a flight suit and harness of her own. No helmet or 'rig', the light armored shell that Undaunted combat pilots wore - those are a bit more expensive - but, still, a suit including a full set of patches for VSA-103, the 'Valkyries', for whom Scotty had just taken over as the executive officer. 

They’re pretty cool patches. 

Slightly less cool was Cayenne getting sized and fit for the flight suit. The item of clothing is comfortable, but just form-fitting enough to make her more than a bit self conscious about her figure. She doesn't want to look like she was trying to be too bold. This is just going flying, after all: something that matters a lot to Scotty. Not trying to... do. Something. 

Something she had the occasional idle fantasy or lewd dream about.

Something, indeed. 

Cayenne shakes her head and finishes zipping up the flight suit, with one of the girls giving her a knowing look before suggesting she zip it a bit lower with a motion of her hand. Mixed with a sports bra and the tank top the squadron usually wore underneath. Well. Cayenne’s certainly showing off more of her fluffy cleavage than she normally does, but it’s still... classy. Right? She doesn't look desperate, or like some Earth pin-up model, does she?

She checks a mirror after getting her boots on and suppresses a groan as she grabs her bag. She almost certainly is more on the pin up model side of things, presenting what to a Human was no doubt an absolutely gargantuan amount of her chest... Maybe next time, if there is a next time, she'll have the time to set up axiom pockets so she could present a more put-together, trimmer look than her current green-wrapped hour glass accented by red gold fur. 

He might like it, though. 

That puts a bit of a wag back in her tail as she thanks the AFE girls and heads down towards the hangar bays. Scotty had brought one of the shuttles up to the squadron hangar bay so he could give her a tour and make the walk a bit shorter. It’s him showing off a bit, but she likes it when he shows off, especially like this. 

He meets her in the passageway and escorts her into the hangar, telling her all sorts of interesting things she’s having trouble hearing with her pulse galloping in her ears. 

Is this a date? It seems like a lot of trouble to go to for just a friend. Neither she nor Scotty had clarified though. What does that mean? What could it mean? Does he not see her that way and he’s just really generous? Is this a prelude to being asked out? What if? What about? Had Scotty already asked her out in his opinion? Were they dating?

Does it matter?

The single clarion question shatters its way through Cayenne's anxieties and she almost instantly calms down as they approach the shuttlecraft 'Percheron', apparently named for some sort of Earth animal. It’s a pleasant looking craft, smaller than a lighter but larger than most pleasure crafts. It’s in the Undaunted's preferred shade of military gray for utility vessels, and someone had done some artful nose art of a Mrega-esque quadruped that Cayenne figures is a Percheron. Right under the cockpit on the pilot's side there’s also the black silhouette of some kind of other ship with a white skull and crossbones mark that she can't quite puzzle out.

She climbs in after Scotty and the hatch seals behind her, leaving her anxieties firmly trapped outside. 

This flight doesn't have to mean anything except having a fun time with someone she enjoys the company of. If it becomes more, she’ll deal with it then. She’s hardly a little girl. She’s a grown woman, and she'd even been married before! Surely she could handle spending time with a man! 

Before long she's comfortably installed in the co-pilot's chair as Scotty finishes explaining the controls and running the Percheron through her startup sequence. 

""Percheron to Tear Control. I have information yankee and my flight plan is on file. Requesting departure vectors from bay Victor One.""

""Control copies. Will you be utilizing a catapult assisted launch, Percheron?""

Scotty looks over at Cayenne and smiles. 

""Not today, Control. Just going out to keep my hands warm and see the sights."" 

""Control copies. Vectors flashed to your navi comp. Canis Prime orbital control's frequency is also in your comm unit... now. They have your flight plan, so you just need to check in.""

""Percheron copies all.""

""Clear to launch, have a good afternoon.""

""Clear to launch, Percheron from Victor One. Good afternoon.""

Scotty looks over at Cayenne and smiles again. 

""Alright. Here we go!""

Scotty switches the shuttle over to anti-grav, pulling in the landing struts all in smooth, practiced moments that Cayenne finds very admirable… and then he throws the throttle forward and the sleek form of the Percheron dives gracefully through the axiom field at the edge of the landing bay and slips into the void she'd been born to travel. 

There's ships, what Scotty called 'traffic', everywhere and Cayenne watches in breathless wonder as Scotty maneuvers them through the complex web of travel lanes, satellite and space station orbits that makes up the busiest space Cayenne's ever been in, at least with this kind of view. The capital world of the Cannidor Khannate is a busy one, even if they keep the population on their home world strictly controlled. Massive freighters, warships, cruise liners bringing tourists and immigrants from across the stars: a complex dance made of billions of lives. 

Before long, though, they're clear of Canis Prime, and Scotty sets their course to the asteroid belt that separates the Canis System's 'inner' and 'outer' worlds. An even split of five worlds apiece, with two of those ten worlds being habitable, along with some habitable moons and some massive space constructions to include huge orbiting habitats, shipyards, mining stations and, this being the Cannidor, defense stations. 

""So where are we going, Scotty? You've been very secretive.""

He smiles over at her again, making her pulse speed up slightly. 

""Well, there's apparently a really pretty visual effect that you can see from certain parts of this asteroid belt, kind of like an aurora but in space, so I figured that'd be something neat we could both see together that neither of us has seen before. You telling me all those stories about your travels has me wanting to make sure we get out there and see things, you know?""

Cayenne hears herself responding on autopilot as what might have been a very casual and not at all intimate thing to say hits her like a truck. Sure, the 'we' could mean a lot of groups of people, but the we before that had been the two of them. So it stands to reason that this 'we' also means the two of them. Which suddenly makes her very glad that Scotty can't easily see her tail. 

Before long they're cutting into the asteroid field with Scotty's hand firmly on the yoke, talking Cayenne through what he's doing and why, the play-by-play letting her relax almost completely as they move between rocks. Cayenne had been tasked to keep a sharp eye out for rogue asteroids, not uncommon in a place like this, and an organic back up to the ship's sensors and computer was, in Scotty's eye, very important. 

It’s only after they were about in position to start seeing the aurora that Cayenne spots something that drastically changes the tone of this particular date. 

""...Scotty, does it look like there's another ship out there to you?""

She points at a strangely moving 'asteroid' which suddenly lets out a slight red light. Nearby, another red light responds, and Scotty checks his controls intently. 

""...The hell? The sensors are calling those rocks, but they're ships for sure. Good eye, Cayenne. I don't like this at all..."" 

He murmurs to himself slightly while reaching slowly for the sensor controls, likely to cut them down to minimum power, and turn off their transponder… but before he can do anything, the comm unit pings with the tone of an incoming message. 

""Shit. Make sure you're strapped in tight, Cayenne. Just in case."" 

Scotty opens the voice channel. 

""The hell is an Undaunted shuttle doing out here? Beating up our girls on planet ain't enough for you fucks? Well, fuck it. Your corpse will make a fine message to your leaders to fuck off from where you ain't wanted. Sorry about the accident you're gonna officially suffer, though."" 

Scotty's hands tighten on the yoke as his eyes narrow. ""...You're welcome to try, Black Khans transport. Come and get me!"" 

""How'd he know we-"" 

Scotty cuts the transmission even as he dives the Percheron, throwing the throttle up to the max he’s willing to use in the asteroid field as he smacks the emergency signal button on the comm unit. It gives him static for a moment, making him swear under his breath.

""They're jamming us. No wonder they think they can actually get away with this. Unfortunately for them, the Percheron is far from a normal shuttle, and their jamming isn't going to cut it against military grade communications equipment.""

He flips another few switches, and there's another tone that signals connection.

""Percheron to Control. Omega signal. I'm under fire by what I believe to be Black Khans smugglers."" 

""...Control copies. Launching the alert five and getting them headed your way. We'll also get in touch with Systems Defense - they should have a corvette out your way. Is there anything else we can do for you, Commander?""

""Not at this time. Gotta start dancing now. Percheron out."" 

Scotty looks over at Cayenne with a reassuring smile. 

""Alright. We've got this. I'm gonna need your help, though. So I had you keeping an eye out for asteroids? I need you doing that with your eyes and the sensors, and if you see anything moving in at us from an angle I don't expect, call it out, and be ready to modulate the shields using that blue control panel in front of you. See the control with the two dials?""

""Ah, yes! I see it!""

""Okay. Press those three switches next to it... just like that, good. The dials will now put axiom energy towards different parts of the shield bubble on two different axes, repairing damage or strengthening the shield. You put them where I tell you to, or where the sensors suggest just as quick as you can, and adjust power levels to various systems with those levers to your left. Got it?""

Cayenne wants to stammer, wants to be scared, but for once in her life she's completely calm.

""Got it!"" 

""Thatta girl. Now hold on to your tail!""

The Percheron jerks violently around, the inertial compensator barely keeping Cayenne comfortable in her chair as she watches her newly assigned controls and panels like a hawk. The smugglers are moving fast now and the sensors have them firmly tagged as two red dots in the swirling chaos of the asteroid field. Focusing on the sensors means not looking out the window into the void and seeing exactly what Scotty’s doing… probably for the best, since looking out into the void would not be the thing to keep her calm as Scotty dances around various asteroids at all angles, the little shuttle seemingly responding to its pilot eagerly as he throws it through a series of violent maneuvers. 

It's only when the glow of an explosion blinks outside the window and Cayenne suddenly has to adjust the shields that she fully processes what the Black Khans are up to.

""They're shooting at us!""

""They have been for a while, actually. Pretty normal way to express you want to kill someone. Only lasers too, which I guess I'll call lucky.""

""Why us, though?""

""Dunno, but where I come from the rule is that if someone ever tries to kill you, you try to kill them right back. I can't have my manners be found wanting!""

She hears the sound of energy capacitors shifting and discharging as the Percheron's dorsal weapons begin to fire, their automated targeting systems letting them track even as Scotty and their targets continue their dance around the asteroids. 

""I'm surprised you can hit anything in all this mess.""

""Probably can't, honestly, but I don't need to hit them. I just need to make it harder for them to hit us."" 

Cayenne nods, focusing in tight on her assigned tasks; she’s just adjusting the shields when she notices a stray plasma blast detonate a small asteroid, the superheated rock exploding in a cloud of shrapnel.

""Scotty! The asteroids! Shoot them with the plasma guns!"" 

""What?""

""It'll make the rocks explode and the smugglers can't dodge everything!"" 

Scotty looks over at Cayenne for a second, eyes wide.

""Cayenne, I could kiss you! I didn't think of that! Not really an option we have back home. Hold on!"" 

Scotty throws them into another violent series of maneuvers, all while using his implant to mark a few asteroids as pre-set targets on the sensor package where Cayenne can see them. Another weave through a burst of pulse laser fire and the plasma guns open up with burning balls of star fire, superheating a few smaller asteroids around one of the smuggler ships and showering it with high speed rocks, damaging its shields enough to let Scotty score some hard hits with their own lasers and another burst of plasma fire. 

The lighter immediately begins lagging behind as her wingwoman breaks off from her, the two ships no doubt exchanging all sorts of charming communication... but it’s too late for them. An ominous shadow slides between the Canis system's sun and the asteroid belt, and a wide-band transmission cuts into their comm systems.

""This is the Systems Defense cutter Gnarlfang. Heave to, power down, and prepare to be boarded. Resistance means you will be fired upon.""

""Percheron to Gnarlfang, complying.""

Scotty responds immediately, already securing the weapons and bringing them about. Considering the Gnarlfang is a full size corvette interceptor, from what Cayenne knows of such things, trusting in their guns and the Percheron's shields probably isn't the worst idea in the world. 

A thought reinforced by the undamaged smuggler trying to run and having her engines shot out in a blinding burst of laser fire for her trouble! 

Scotty looks over at Cayenne with a frown.

""Well. Damn. This is probably gonna make us late for our dinner reservations."" 

Pulse still racing, Cayenne's mouth moves before her brain has a chance to catch up; ""Well. You. Could make it up to me... with what you mentioned earlier.""

""...What did I mention earlier?""

Cayenne ducks her head, ears flattening slightly, surely she'd just misheard him, but she was committed now! 

""A... A kiss.""

""Oh. Ooooh. Well. Uh. Yeah. I'd. Like that."" 

Cayenne suddenly sits stock up right, ears snapping up. Had she heard that right?

""Really?""

""Yeah. Really.""

Maybe waiting for the systems defense crew to clear them back to the Crimson Tear wouldn't be so boring after all.

1ol1oge,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningToBecome/comments/1ol1oge/advice_how_boring_people_become_magnetic_the/,[Advice] How boring people become magnetic: the underrated art of small talk (and how to master it),"Everyone lowkey hates small talk. It feels fake. It feels pointless. And most people either overdo it or avoid it completely. But here’s the thing — small talk isn’t small. It’s the gateway drug to deep connection, better jobs, new friends, dates, and straight-up social survival. The ability to casually talk to strangers is one of those cheat codes that makes life easier, yet no one teaches it properly.

If you feel awkward, freeze up, or blank out in conversations, you’re not broken or doomed. Most people were never taught how to talk in a natural, confident way. And honestly, a lot of the viral TikTok advice on “alpha energy” or “rizz tactics” is just performance. It doesn’t teach you how to be real or present.

This is a breakdown of actual methods that work, based on research, psychology, and painfully awkward trial and error. Sourced from books, podcasts, behavioral science labs, and social skills coaches — not influencers winging it for clout.

This post isn’t to turn you into a charismatic extrovert. It’s to help you become more socially fluent, even if you're quiet, analytical, or just tired of overthinking every word. 

Here’s what actually helps:

- **Ditch the goal of being interesting. Focus on being interested.** Harvard psychologist Dr. Zenger found that people rate conversations as “great” when *they themselves* do most of the talking. In other words, if you ask thoughtful questions and listen well, people walk away liking *you*. The book *Captivate* by Vanessa Van Edwards breaks this down — being curious makes you magnetic.

- **Use the FORD framework when stuck**: Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams. These are four safe zones for conversation. If you’re at a party or networking event, ask things like: “What’s keeping you busy lately?” or “How’d you get into that field?” or “Doing anything fun this weekend?” It gives people mental space to choose what they feel like talking about.

- **Open with observations, not questions.** Instead of jumping into “So what do you do?”, try saying something about the environment: “This place is louder than I expected.” or “Honestly, I came for the snacks.” This feels natural and lets them respond without pressure. Behavioral science expert Nick Morgan found that people connect faster when they feel like they’re “co-experiencing” something — even if it’s just bad coffee.

- **Don’t memorize lines. Memorize patterns.** The best conversationalists don’t rely on scripts. They notice social cues. The book *The Charisma Myth* by Olivia Fox Cabane explains that presence, warmth, and power are the real trifecta — not punchlines. So instead of trying to be funny, try to be fully *there*. Look at the person. React to what they say. Match their energy a bit. That’s what makes people relax.

- **Mirror their phrasing to build trust.** If someone says, “I’ve been swamped at work,” reply using their words: “Swamped sounds intense. What’s been going on?” Studies from the Journal of Language and Social Psychology show that subtle linguistic mimicry makes people feel heard and builds rapport.

- **Avoid rapid-fire questions. Make it a back-and-forth.** Think like jazz, not an interview. If someone says they like hiking, don’t just say “cool.” Say “Ever done anything sketchy like a climb you weren’t ready for?” or even share your own dumb nature story. That little bit of personal info invites mutual sharing.

- **Silence isn’t the enemy.** A 2021 study from the University of Groningen found that most people overestimate how awkward pauses are. In fact, slight silence actually gives weight to what you just said and gives the other person time to process. You don’t need to fill every second. Just breathe.

- **Practice “low-stakes reps” every day.** Say one sentence to your barista. Ask your coworker what they’re listening to. Compliment someone’s phone case. These tiny reps build fluency. Think of it like language immersion. You don’t get fluent by reading grammar books. You get fluent by talking — badly, then better.

- **Exit gracefully when it’s time.** You don’t owe people endless attention. If the convo stalls or you need to move on, say: “I’m gonna grab a drink, but I’m glad we got to chat,” or “I’m going to say hi to a friend, but it was nice meeting you!” It’s polite, clean, and totally normal.

And here’s what NOT to trust:

- **“Just fake confidence.”** This gets thrown around too much. It’s not about pretending. It’s about *shifting your attention away from yourself*. Confidence isn’t being loud. It’s being comfortable enough to let someone else be the main character for a bit.

- **“Alpha body language” hacks.** Standing with your shoulders back helps, sure. But none of that matters if your energy is off. People pick up on congruence. Be calm, be kind, be present. That wins every time.

- **“Talk about yourself more.”** This advice only works *after* trust is built. Oversharing too early can come off as odd. Instead, use the 40/60 rule. Let them talk 60% of the time. You talk 40%. Adjust as needed, depending on the flow.

If you want deeper sources, here’s what helped most:

- *The Like Switch* by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent who teaches how to build rapport fast)
- *Captivate* by Vanessa Van Edwards (social skills decoded through behavioral science)
- *The Art of Conversation* episode on the Hidden Brain podcast (breaks down why we misjudge our own communication skills)

Let’s be real — conversation isn’t always fun. Some people won’t vibe with you. Some chats just don’t click. That’s fine. The key is to keep showing up, stay curious, and not take social friction personally. Anyone can learn this stuff. It’s not charm. It’s just practice and pattern recognition.

And yeah, the more you talk, the easier it gets. Even if you’re bad at first.

That’s the cheat code most charismatic people won’t admit.

A €5 ticket grants access to the new bridge under **Jareb Mill** and the scenic paths descending into the **Korana canyon**. Tickets can be bought online or at web kiosks (card only) located at **Entrance 1** and **St. John Bridge (Most sv. Ivana)**. The walk takes around an hour, and there are plenty of viewpoints for photos.

For those who love small museums, visit **Slovin Unique Rastoke**, an estate showcasing historic tools, channels, and even a small cave. It’s independently managed (separate ticket) and closed on Tuesdays. Nearby, **Jareb Mill (OPG Jarebovi mlinovi)** occasionally demonstrates flour production using traditional methods.

Getting here is easy. By car, take the A1 motorway to Karlovac and continue along the D1 to Slunj (about 1h30). By bus, Zagreb–Slunj services run several times daily and drop you about a 10-minute walk from the village. If you’re staying in the area, combine Rastoke with **Plitvice Lakes** for an unforgettable day of turquoise water and lush scenery.

Parking can be confusing for first-timers. **Zone 1** (closest to the village) costs about €2/hour, while **Zones 2–3** are cheaper at €0.40/hour and only a short walk away. Pay by coin, card, or SMS if you have a Croatian number. During peak hours, arrive early or park farther out and walk.

Families should note: paths and bridges are uneven, and steps appear on the loop. Lightweight strollers can work in the upper lanes, but carriers are easier for toddlers. For swimmers, the Korana River near Slunj offers calm bathing spots in summer—locals love it!

For dining, local restaurants serve grilled trout, homemade soups, and fresh cheeses. Riverside terraces are perfect for a late lunch or coffee after your walk. If you’re staying overnight, choose between charming guesthouses in Rastoke, family-friendly stays in Slunj, or countryside farm stays nearby.

Rastoke is peaceful, compact, and magical in any season—lush in spring, golden in autumn, and quiet in winter. Whether you stop for two hours or spend the night, it’s a perfect escape into Croatia’s timeless river scenery and craftsmanship.

### Health and Wellness Devotional: Embracing the Quiet

#### Finding God’s Presence in Solitude

**Scripture Reading:** 1 Kings 19:11-12

*“And after the fire came a gentle whisper.”*

**Reflection:**

In our bustling world, it’s easy to become overwhelmed by noise—both external and internal. The demands of work, family, and social obligations can drown out the gentle whisper of God’s presence. Yet, Scripture teaches us that often, God speaks in the stillness.

Elijah, a great prophet, found himself despondent and weary. In his quest for direction, he sought God on Mount Horeb. There, God did not appear in the wind, earthquake, or fire, but in a **gentle whisper**. This moment illustrates an essential component of well-being: the power of solitude.

**The Importance of Solitude for Health:**

1. **Mental Clarity**: Taking time for quiet reflection allows our minds to settle, making space for clarity and focus. Research shows that moments of solitude can lead to improved decision-making and creativity. When we stop to listen, we often discover insights that were previously clouded by the noise surrounding us.
2. **Emotional Restoration**: Solitude offers a safe space to process our feelings. It allows us to confront our fears and anxieties in God’s presence, leading to emotional healing. Psalm 46:10 reminds us, *“Be still, and know that I am God.”* In stillness, we can unburden our hearts and find restoration.
3. **Spiritual Growth**: When we intentionally seek God in quiet moments, we cultivate a deeper relationship with Him. These moments become sacred, transforming our understanding of prayer from mere words to a profound dialogue.
4. **Physical Well-being**: Removing distractions and embracing solitude can lower stress levels, contributing to better physical health. Mindfulness and meditation, often practiced in quiet, have been linked to lower blood pressure, improved immunity, and increased feelings of well-being.

**Embracing the Quiet: Practical Steps**

1. **Schedule Solitude**: Just as we schedule meetings and obligations, carve out time exclusively for quiet moments with God. This could be as simple as a morning coffee alone or an evening walk free from distractions.
2. **Create a Sacred Space**: Designate an area in your home or find a natural space that invites peace. This could be a favorite chair, a garden bench, or a quiet room. Use this space for prayer, meditation, or simply being with God.
3. **Practice Mindfulness**: Engage in practices like deep breathing or meditation to help calm the mind. Focus on God’s promises as you breathe in and out, letting go of worries with each exhale.
4. **Listen for the Whisper**: In these moments of silence, intentionally listen. Journaling your thoughts, prayers, or insights can help you discern God’s guidance in your life.

**Prayer:**

Heavenly Father, help us to embrace moments of quiet and solitude in our busy lives. Teach us to listen for Your gentle whisper amid the chaos. May we find comfort, clarity, and connection in these sacred moments. Encourage us to seek Your presence and recognize that we are never alone. Amen.

**Closing Thought:**

As you embark on this journey of embracing quietness, remember that each moment spent in solitude brings you closer to God. Trust that He is there, waiting to meet you in the gentle whispers of your heart. Allow His presence to guide you toward a healthier, more fulfilling life.

This time I took my socially inept friend with me and did it. I was the one to walk in and talk to the barista, apparently my friend is even more anxious than me, but having \*someone\* by your side helps a ton. The barista was slightly friendly and made some jokes and I tried to do so too, but that didn't end up much of a conversation. We bought coffees then went and sat at a table and just talked between us two for a while, that's it.

Didn't interact with anyone else, basically it was like going to a cafe. Whereas everyone else already knew each other and were mingling at the bar chatting and a few were playing a board game.

1ol1j1t,https://www.rawstory.com/raw-investigates/cory-bowman,JD Vance’s half-brother suspected of voter fraud — the very thing the GOP rages against,"Republican mayoral candidate Cory Bowman, the half-brother of Vice President JD Vance, is facing a significant pre-election controversy regarding his residency and voting history—a core issue in a race where the GOP is attempting to ""Flip the 'Nati."" The questions raised by an Ohio newsletter suggest Bowman may have violated election laws he and his party have championed as crucial for ""election security.""

The central allegation, reported by The Rooster, is that Bowman may have cast a fraudulent vote on October 7 by utilizing a registered address where he no longer permanently resides.

**The Conflicting Addresses and Social Media Claims**

According to voting records reviewed on October 29, Bowman and his wife, Jordan, remain registered to vote at a property he owns in the College Hill neighborhood. It was this address that was used when Bowman cast his early ballot.

**However, several conflicting pieces of information muddy the picture of his actual residence**:

* **Mailing Address**: His official mailing address is listed as an apartment on West 4th Street, Downtown, which generally indicates a permanent residence change.

* **Candidate’s Statements**: Bowman made a series of social media posts claiming his family had ""decided to move everything back downtown"" after the May primary and that the West End had become his campaign's ""ground zero"" and ""our home."" Notably, the West End and the Downtown West 4th Street addresses are in distinct areas of the city.

The problem, according to critics, is that voting from the College Hill address, when he appears to be residing downtown, could mean he illegally voted in a specific judicial district he is no longer eligible for, thereby violating Ohio law regarding a voter's ""permanent"" place of habitation.

**A Vexing Question of Election Security**

The controversy places Bowman in a politically awkward position. Ohio Republicans, including his half-brother, have been vocal advocates for stricter voting regulations and have repeatedly stressed that using an out-of-date address constitutes voter fraud.

Bowman, a pastor and co-owner of a local coffee shop, entered the race citing a need for ""real change"" and promising to restore Cincinnati to a city with ""clean, safe, and prosperous streets."" His connection to Vice President Vance has given the campaign a national profile, though Vance has been notably quiet on the campaign since the primary.

As of the current date, the Bowman campaign has not responded to requests for comment regarding his residency or whether his early ballot was cast provisionally. Furthermore, the Ohio Secretary of State's office confirmed to Raw Story that no official complaint regarding the voter fraud allegation has been filed with the Hamilton County Board of Elections or their public integrity unit.

The confusion over where the mayoral hopeful permanently resides—and whether that fact led to an unlawful vote—is set to loom over the campaign as the election against incumbent Democrat Aftab Pureval approaches.

The general election results for the Cincinnati mayoral race, which took place shortly after the publication of the article, and information regarding an official investigation are as follows:

**1. Cincinnati Mayoral Election Outcome**

The incumbent Democratic Mayor Aftab Pureval won re-election against Republican challenger Cory Bowman.

* **Aftab Pureval, Democrat**: Won Re-election. Pureval secured a comfortable victory, consistent with Cincinnati's long-standing preference for Democratic leadership

* **Cory Bowman, Republican**: Lost. Bowman advanced to the general election after placing a distant second in the nonpartisan primary, with only about 13% of the vote compared to Pureval's 83%.

* **Context of the Race**: Cincinnati is a strongly Democratic city, and Mayor Pureval was widely expected to win. The election marked the first time in 16 years that a Republican (Bowman) made it to the general mayoral ballot.

**2. Official Investigation Status**

As of the available information, there appears to have been no official investigation launched into the voter fraud allegation against Cory Bowman.

* The initial article noted that the Ohio Secretary of State's Public Integrity Unit had not received a complaint regarding the matter, nor were they aware of any complaints made to the Hamilton County Board of Elections.

* Searches for subsequent reports do not indicate that a formal investigation was initiated by state or county election officials following the publication of the article.

* The political impact of the allegation appears to have remained largely confined to media coverage and political commentary during the final days of the campaign, rather than resulting in a formal legal challenge or inquiry.",1,1761933363.0,politics_NOW,0,1.0,False

Coffee, nutmeg, cinnamon, saffron tease.  
Yuyuko’s—like a bloated belly.  
Hina’s—laden with curses, heavy.

Suika’s fanny reeks of beer,  
The three fairies’ smell playful and clear.  
Prismriver’s—of song and dance,  
Remilia’s—of bloody romance.

Freedom’s scent clings to Clownpiece’s drawers,  
Yukari’s boomer vag drops sand from its pores.  
The shrine maiden China smells of toil,  
Yuki’s—like a fighting youkai’s spoil.

Suwako’s reeks of frogs all through,  
Kanako’s smells old too.  
Yamame’s gives off foul miasma,  
Youmu’s panties reek of ectoplasm.

Sakuya’s coochie—of knives and a loo,  
Kaguya’s—of the lunar view.  
Mokou’s flares with fiery spite,  
Alice’s minge—her dolls hold tight.

And then beneath that thieving hat,  
A witch’s boldness, human brat—  
You’ve guessed it,  
Marisa’s here,  
Her hoo-ha stinking of mushrooms, dear.

Of unwashed flesh, of shit, of booze,  
Of smoke, decay, rot’s foul hues,  
Of death and blood, the mugger’s prize...  
What reeks so strong?  
The shrine maiden’s shrussy lies.",14,1761933317.0,2hujerk,2,1.0,False

I had three credit cards, nothing crazy, all paid on time, but I thought having multiple accounts was unnecessary. I kept seeing posts about “simplifying your finances” and “cutting out unused cards,” so I figured I’d do the smart thing and close the one I barely used. It was my first card, opened when I was 19. I didn’t even think twice about it.

Fast forward to last month, I checked my credit score and nearly spat out my coffee. It had dropped by like 40 points for no apparent reason. I panicked, went down a Reddit rabbit hole, and learned that closing your oldest credit card can hurt your score because it shortens your credit history and messes with your utilization ratio. Basically, I punished myself for trying to be responsible. Love that for me.

Now I’m slowly trying to fix it. I reopened one card, set small recurring charges on it, and started using tools that actually help build credit without adding more debt stress. I even started using debit cards that report to the credit bureaus, so I can build credit just by spending my own money.

I’ve been a beekeeper for about **12 years**, but I’m also a software developer.  
And for the past decade, I’ve been carrying one unfinished idea in my head — a proper **digital beekeeping diary**.

Back in **2014**, when I was still in high school, I created my first-ever Android app called *Deník včelaře* (“Beekeeper’s Diary”).  
It was terrible by today’s standards 😅 — but it worked: it let me record basic hive inspections, feedings, and treatments.

Fast forward a few years → I got into professional software development, learned better practices, and decided to rebuild the idea properly — this time as a **cross-platform mobile app** using **.NET MAUI + Firebase**.

After many late nights, side-project weekends, and one too many cups of coffee ☕, I finally released:

* **ApiNote for Android (2023)**
* **ApiNote for iOS (this week!) 🎉**

The app helps beekeepers:

* Record inspections, honey harvests, feedings & treatments
* See local weather per apiary
* Visualize bee flight range on a map
* Store notes & photos for each hive
* Analyze seasonal productivity via stats

I built everything myself — backend, design, translations, UI/UX.  
If you’re into indie devs, side projects, or nature/tech mashups, I’d really appreciate your **feedback** or a **rating** 🙏

👉 [https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/v%C4%8Dela%C5%99sk%C3%BD-den%C3%ADk-apinote/id6752503587?platform=iphone](https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/v%C4%8Dela%C5%99sk%C3%BD-den%C3%ADk-apinote/id6752503587?platform=iphone)

**Tech stack:**

* .NET MAUI (cross-platform)
* Firebase Firestore + Crashlytics
* C# async binding between app and JS (for web integration)
* Native features: camera, maps, weather API

App is free to use - for beekeepers with 5+ hives, there is subscription (3.99$) ApiNote Pro.

Happy to answer any technical questions — this project taught me a ton about managing long-term ideas, motivation, and polishing something until it actually feels “done” (spoiler: it never is 😅).

She constantly messages me random stuff like: I just got home, I got coffee, I got Pizza, going for a run, etc. Small little micro updates on what she's doing. Maybe it's because I'm a guy, but I don't really understand why she does this constantly and daily.

I'm not trying to badmouth, just trying to understand. And we do have full conversations, usually when we're both free, but between those full conversations she does this. I almost never know what to reply with, and whenever I do reply, it's always something short. Like ""I got coffee"" ""Ooo did you get something fancy or something basic?"" ""Mocha latte"". Like I don't understand why you tell me these things if you aren't looking to talk?",1,1761933060.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1ol1dnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1ol1dnv/i_finally_turned_my_10yearold_beekeeping_app_idea/,I finally turned my 10-year-old beekeeping app idea into a real product 🐝📱,"Hey everyone,  
I’ve been a beekeeper for about **12 years**, but I’m also a software developer.  
And for the past decade, I’ve been carrying one unfinished idea in my head — a proper **digital beekeeping diary**.

Back in **2014**, when I was still in high school, I created my first-ever Android app called *Deník včelaře* (“Beekeeper’s Diary”).  
It was terrible by today’s standards 😅 — but it worked: it let me record basic hive inspections, feedings, and treatments.

Fast forward a few years → I got into professional software development, learned better practices, and decided to rebuild the idea properly — this time as a **cross-platform mobile app** using **.NET MAUI + Firebase**.

After many late nights, side-project weekends, and one too many cups of coffee ☕, I finally released:

* **ApiNote for Android (2023)**
* **ApiNote for iOS (this week!) 🎉**

The app helps beekeepers:

* Record inspections, honey harvests, feedings & treatments
* See local weather per apiary
* Visualize bee flight range on a map
* Store notes & photos for each hive
* Analyze seasonal productivity via stats

I built everything myself — backend, design, translations, UI/UX.  
If you’re into indie devs, side projects, or nature/tech mashups, I’d really appreciate your **feedback** or a **rating** 🙏

👉 [beekeeperdiary.com](https://beekeeperdiary.com)

**Tech stack:**

* .NET MAUI (cross-platform)
* Firebase Firestore + Crashlytics
* Native features: camera, maps, weather API

Happy to answer any technical questions — this project taught me a ton about managing long-term ideas, motivation, and polishing something until it actually feels “done” (spoiler: it never is 😅).

Anyway, I was putting away coffee mugs the other weekend where I accidentally broke a limited edition Morbid coffee mug my girlfriend bought back in about 2022 if I can remember. We have since replaced her glass coffee mug, but it was one of her favorites! If any Morbid fans happen to have that mug, and are open to selling, I’d love to buy it again and surprise her with the original. Unfortunately, I can’t find it on Facebook marketplace or eBay (which makes sense). Please let me know in the comments if anyone has a lead on this mug! ",3,1761933021.0,MorbidPodcast,0,0.8,False

I've only gotten to visit a few times. The first time was after a class one day at Academy, the instructor suddenly led us several blocks away to his studio. There were these massive realist paintings, some in progress, that were breathtaking, but he said that we couldn't take any photos. He does works like [this](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/578d12388419c22d66362393/1724279591836-EHZWEOITG7ISZIVORBTA/DSC09315CircleofLife.jpg). The second time was when I was doing a workshop at the artist's residence/studio. There were dozens of books around, as well as several drawings/paintings. I really liked [this painting](https://i.postimg.cc/kJz1G4JY/20160814-184936.jpg) in particular, of a cup from a local coffee place.

1ol1aun,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ol1aun,Behold!  The ugliest thing I have ever created!,"And I do not mean the ugliest thing I have ever crocheted.  I mean ever CREATED.  I think my first hobby was making hook rugs when I was 10.  I did embroidery, crewel work, counted cross stitch, quilting, crochet, knitting, baking, and other miscellaneous craft projects.  And in 53 years of crafting and baking this scarf set is without a doubt the ugliest thing I have ever made.

The project was cursed from the start.  I got a three-cake multi pack of this wool blend yarn on clearance for $9.  When I started to use it I realized I hated the abrupt color changes.  I thought color controlling the color changes would help.  It did- but only marginally.  The colors looked good together in the yarn cake.  Not so much in the scarf.  I abandoned this WIP for a month and a half.  I decided to finish it because I was sick and tired of looking at the project bag under the coffee table.  I adapted the free Arden Throw pattern from Premier.  I do like the pattern with the cluster of three DC TOG.  It is a wonderful, mindless pattern.  And that is the only positive thing I can say about this project.

Then came the nightmare of the hat.  I followed a tutorial to make a very basic double crochet beanie.  It is not the first time I have tried a hat like that.  And every time it looks like I am making a flat bottomed, round basket rather than a hat.  This time I decided to keep going to see what happened.  In the end I abandoned the tutorial and went rogue and winged it.  My beanie ended up becoming a tam.  It would have been rather cute if not for the grey circle of color in the center of the hat.  It looked like a giant bald spot in the mirror. 😩. I figured that traditional tams have pom poms so while it wasn’t in the plan, I figured a pom pom would at least cover some of the “bald spot”.  Even a happy pom pom could not save this hat.

This project is one of the donation hat and scarf sets I will soon donate to a local shelter.  I am honestly embarrassed to include this set.  It will certainly help keep someone warn.  But it is just so damn ugly.

And to make matters worse: I bought FIVE more multi packs of this same yarn in different colors.  If anyone has any ideas what I can do with these yarn cakes please let me know.  I love variegated yarns that have those subtle color transitions.  I really do not know how to approach these cakes with the abrupt color changes.  

So this disaster marks the completion of the last WIP.  At this point I can turn my attention to the blanket using the Wool of the Andes yarn.  I bought two afghan kits to make a larger blanket and bought additional colors.  This will be my most expensive project.  The kits were on sale, I used a Welcome promo code, and the individual skeins were on sale.  And with all that I still spent a fortune.  ",2,1761932844.0,crochet,3,1.0,False

— Had a phone screen with recruiter last week. 

— Hiring manager reached out this week to schedule a coffee chat for next week. They stated they had not connected with the recruiter about any candidates. 

— I haven’t heard back from the recruiter yet about next steps, but that wasn’t unexpected as they had interviews scheduled throughout this whole week.

I’ve been having some issues with my mouth and throat the past few weeks. It started with a burning tongue after acidic foods (tomato sauce, coffee, etc.) and now it leads to a tingling sensation at the back of my throat. It’s worse with acidic foods and drinks, but it seems random as to when it happens. Sometimes coffee won’t trigger it at all, or sometimes a “safe” food that hasn’t bothered me one day will bother me the next.

I will also randomly sometimes get a burning sensation on my tongue, the roof of my mouth, and/or my gums. I have been trying saline rinsed and gargling which helps a little, and chewing sugar free gum seems to help the sensation lessen, I’m guessing from the increased saliva.

For the last few days I’ve hand random itching in my inner ears that I can sometimes feel on one side of my throat. Today I looked in my throat and found these bumps above my tonsils. Any idea as to what they are?

Note: I saw an ENT a few years back who noted that my tonsils have some scar tissue, they haven’t changed in size.",1,1761932658.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

- chocolate zucchini bread, strawberry cream cheese 
- lemon blueberry loaf slices, ricotta cheese 
- banana nut bread, cottage cheese 
- apple bread, cheddar cheese 
- coffee chocolate chip bread, mascarpone cheese 
- pear bread, blue cheese 

and then instead of pairing that with a savoury warm soup, you can pair it with a cosy beverage like a cup of hot chocolate, a vanilla matcha latte, a caramel latte, a masala chai, honey chamomile tea, hot apple cider

i personally don't think it would break the 'rules' of grilled cheese i think it fits the basic criteria. bread, cheese, cooking fat. pan fried. just a sweet version of it. i don't know if anyone has already done this before but if not i think we should give it a try before forming any strong judgements or opinions.",6,1761932426.0,grilledcheese,3,0.88,False

1ol0zim,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ol0zim/i_got_revenge_on_my_best_friends_roommate/,I got revenge on my best friend's roommate,"About 10 years ago, I was going between freelance and part time work at an animal shelter. I had an opportunity to be a production assistant on a small indie flick in a town about an hour and a half from my house. Kicker was, housing wasn't going to be available for me for the first week while a production team member was doing their part for the film. Most set days are 12-16 hours, and it's grueling to drive that long for only a couple hours of sleep. My best friend offered her place for me to crash that week because she was about 15 minutes from the set location. I went to her house the day before and settled in, and noticed that in the back yard there was a camping tent set up. Mind you we live in the South -- this was March and we have cold nights and chilly days. I didn't ask about it, and went in. Her roommate (let's call her Karen) was unconcerned with me being there, so much that when I came in she gave me a meager ""oh hey"" and went outside. It was evidently Karen's tent, because she went inside and zipped it shut. I asked my friend about it and she said, ""Oh, Karen literally always is out there watching The Office on her iPad or listening to the Harry Potter books on audio-- loudly."" And she wasn't lying. I could hear Dwight Schrute from through the closed door. Weird flex but okay. So that night, the temps dropped into the 20s. The house they were renting was old, so the insulation was lacking. I was so cold, in fact, I couldn't sleep. I was shivering to the point it felt like my body was caving in. I finally asked my friend why the heat wasn't on, and she said, ""Oh, Karen won't let me cut on the heat. She starts yelling and screaming. It's not worth it."" I was shocked. Because not only was it 20 degrees, but my best friend is diabetic and has neuropathy. Cold isn't good for that, and she was in bed in so many layers it was like looking at a mummy in a fluffy sarcophagus. I decided that I'd just ask Karen myself, and I went to knock on her door. After a few minutes, no one answered, so I figured she was either being rude or slept like a hibernating bear. Instead, I decided to just drink hot coffee to warm up, since there was a maker in the kitchen and I brought my own K-Pods. I opened the machine to find green completely engulfing the pod holder, and I was floored. Not only that, I saw a instant pot in the sink that looked like a science experiment, and the Tupperware was there to match it. I thought I'd be nice and clean up this makeshift science lab, and about the time I started my best friend came into the kitchen to check on me. She goes, ""Oh, you found Karen's mess. Don't clean it, I don't. She's a slob."" And when I said it was no problem, my friend goes, ""No, but it will be."" 👀 Uh okay? No, she was right. The whole kitchen was pretty much Karen. The food, 90% of the fridge, the dirty dishes-- my friend had been allotted a tiny baker's rack in the corner of the dining room to hold everything she had for the kitchen, which was also sprinkled with Karen's shelf stable foods. I had brought my own bit of food, the most important thing the plant milk I had because I had just learned I was lactose intolerant. I decided I would get a glass, microwave it, then just make do with that instead of coffee.

Okay then, no cleaning. Got it. I turned to look in the fridge, and I see outside, Karen's tent is lit up like a Christmas tree and I can hear the audio books. At this point it's 12am and there's already ice crystals forming on the car outside. This girl was STRANGE. So I said, ""Isn't she cold? That tent is hardly warm. It's just nylon."" To which my friend replied, ""Not for her, she has a space heater on in there.""

🙃

At this point, I am tired, cold, and my tolerance for this chick is waning. I want to be a good guest, but this girl was making it hard. So she wants to be warm, but instead of cutting on the heat inside of a house where the heat stays in, and your roommate can be warm, you buy a space heater and stay outside in a tent? You can guess what I did next: I turned the heat on. My friend panicked, but I told her it was fine and there was 0 reason she was paying half the bills and getting no say in anything. That's when she told me she paid the whole utility bill. That was strike two.

There was no remark about the heat, but evidently my friend was taking the blame for it because she didn't tell me til later on. But on day 3, Karen wrote her on Facebook and told her that if I was going to be staying there longer than a day, I needed to pay 1/2 of all the bills, including utilities, and don't be drinking her milk because she saw the glass in the sink. She didn't tell ME, she told HER, which was absolutely the last straw. I tried to call Karen and ask her to talk about it, but she rejected my call. So I texted her, kindly, and said I was sorry if she was upset but it was so cold and we were cold, the heat just needed to be on for a while to break the chill. 

The message came back not sent. 

This cow had BLOCKED ME. 

I was on set, so I couldn't dedicate any time to this issue except deal with it when the day was over. Thankfully, we had a short day and I was able to leave and get back to my friend's house. When I arrived, Karen decided it was suddenly impurvious she had to go to Walmart when she saw me. I said nothing to her and stepped aside, but she grumbled at me as she slammed the door shut. 

I told my friend I appreciated her offer, but it was going to be best for me to leave. So I gathered my things and packed my bag. As I was leaving, I went to grab my milk and I saw Karen's on the door. Despite my judgement, I grabbed it, took a huge swig, swished it like mouthwash and spat it back in the jug. My friend was mortified, but also was excited because she isn't the type to try to piss someone off. I, on the other hand, didn't give a damn.

It was pure luck that that evening the team member left early. I had a condo to stay in 15 minutes from filming. The girl blocked me, but I have heard she moved to Orlando to try to turn her gay friend straight (she's extremely xenophobic and she's convinced she can make him that way.) I have dealt with a lot of people, but that entitled woman child has been the worst I've ever seen. ",1,1761932122.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Sometimes it’s the small, quiet things that mean the most.

A coworker who notices you’re off and brings you coffee without asking.  
A friend who texts, “Just checking in,” even when you haven’t replied for days.  
A parent who says, “Drive safe,” every single time you leave.

Those moments don’t go viral. They don’t look huge from the outside. But when you’re tired, or lonely, or just barely holding it together, those small acts hit different.

I used to overlook them because I thought gratitude had to be for big things, promotions, trips, milestones. But now I realize it’s these little, human moments that actually keep me going.

So today, I’m grateful for the quiet ones, the people who care without needing credit.",11,1761932101.0,gratitude,1,1.0,False

Some context:

— I applied for the role a couple weeks ago and messaged both the hiring manager and recruiter through LinkedIn when I submitted my application. 

— Had a phone screen with recruiter last week. 

— Hiring manager reached out this week to schedule a coffee chat for next week. They stated they had not connected with the recruiter about any candidates. 

— I haven’t heard back from the recruiter yet about next steps, but that wasn’t unexpected as they had interviews scheduled throughout this whole week. 

What should I expect from the coffee chat with the hiring manager? Is this a good sign about my prospects with this opportunity?

1ol0xxk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ol0xxk,[REVIEW]Helm Komodo vs Cadisen Aqua Diver,"I expect this one to be a bit divisive. When it comes to watches, I have my hands in a few communities, with the ones being  relevant to this review being r/chinesewatches and r/microbrandwatches. In the last decade, I've enjoyed watching both industries enjoy tremendous success and growth, carving out new spaces in the watch collecting world. Many Chinese watch companies have worked hard to shake off the reputation of Canal St. knockoffs and are producing compelling original designs with impressive finishing at multiple price points. The microbrand space has allowed smaller brands to establish more niche design languages and take more risks than legacy brands - as consumers, we are now spoiled for choice. 



Before I get further into this review, I’d like to share a bit about my entry to the hobby of watch collection (and obsession). At the time I was slinging lattes for a well known coffee chain. Thanks to a combination of Reddit, watchuseek forum posts, and Instagram, I began to develop a thirst for the finer things in the watch collecting world. A Tudor taste on a Timex budget, Panerai preference on a Pagani Design Paycheck. These were unobtainable, but I still needed a watch and it had to be an automatic. After much deliberation and advice from kind internet strangers, I made my first watch purchase - the venerable sxk007. I could wax poetic about how amazing the watch is, how it will never leave my collection, etc. but to put a point on it, I was a kid who had found a hobby they wanted to participate in and was able to do so because there was an affordable option, and a damn good one to boot. If the hobbies we love are to continue to grow, they need to remain accessible to the next generation. 



That kid also grew up burning CD’s with MP3s downloaded off Napster for his friends. Mixtapes with uncleared samples were popular, South Park, Professional Wrestling, and Punk Rock were all part of the cultural landscape that fostered a healthy disdain of authority. We were all laughing, because after all, we wouldn't download a car. IYKYK, you had to be for it. That latte slinging kid is older and debatably wiser, but there is still a streak of that punk rock ethos from his formative years.



And now we can move on to the recipe for grandma's secret cornbread. I mean the watches. 



Helm was founded in 2014 and has somewhat of a cult following. Initially stationed in the USA, they are now based in Hong Kong. Their unapologetically bulky design language and functional tool watch ethos isn't for everybody and that's ok - not everyone has to like everything. I’m a huge fan of the brand, and prior to the release of the three Togiak variants this August, I owned a variation of every watch in their lineup. Their watches are only available for purchase through a waitlist or lottery system - it is still a small operation and they produce a limited number of watches each month. Their watches also pop up on the secondary market, and trade at slightly above or below retail depending on condition. Depending on the model, they cost between $295-$375+ shipping, and if you want a massive slab of titanium or steel around your wrist, I don't think there is better value out there.. Despite being such a small company, Helms customer service is top tier, their QC is excellent, and they stand behind their products.



Cadisen was established in 2013 in Shenzhen, China, and other than that, I know next to nothing about the brand that isn't listed on their website. Their catalog consists mostly of homages with a few original designs sprinkled in, and they are on sale frequently on AliExpress for between $50-$100.



On to the specs: the Helm Komodo is 40mm in diameter, 45mm including the crown, and has a lug to lug of 47mm. The height, including the domed sapphire crystal, is a massive 15.5mm. The case is made of 316L steel and has a brushed finish. There is a signed screw down crown with crown guards that sweep gently out from the case. In my configuration, the dial is a matte white surrounded by a matching chapter ring. The indices, hands, and bezel are all a pale blue and color matched well. The 120 click bezel is lumed on all markers and turning it is stiff but not overly so; it requires intent to operate and feels like a true tool watch. From a tactile perspective, the clicks are snappy and loud.  Helm is well known for their lume and this watch is no exception: All lumed components glow brightly with BWG9 for hours and the lumed date wheel is a nice touch. It is powered by the NH35 movement and costs $295 + shipping. The watch is ISO 6425 compliant, meaning it meets certain durability criteria, and boasts a water resistance of 300m. The bracelet is in a simple single link style but is solid, articulates well, has snug fitting end links, and a milled clasp that balances the heft of the watch head and has 5 microadjust holes. 



The Cadisen Aqua Diver is 40mm in diameter, and has a lug to lug of 45mm. The height is 12.5mm including the flat sapphire crystal. The case is made of 316L steel and has a brushed finish. There is a signed screw down crown with crown guards that sweep gently out from the case. The dial and chapter ring on the Aqua Diver are a metallic white vs the matte of the Komodo. The blue color scheme of the Komodo is also present, but in a darker shade of blue. If you’re a F1 fan I’d say the bezel especially is fairly close to the Mercedes/Petronas livery. The 120 click bezel turns with very minimal resistance, and is much lighter both in terms of volume and operation. As for lume - only the 12-o-clock pip has any. The hands have decently bright blue lume but the indices only give the faintest suggestion of a glow. It is powered by the NH35 movement and I was able to snag it on sale for around $50. It claims a 100m water resistance.. The bracelet is in a simple single link style, articulates well, has snug fitting end links, and a milled clasp that is very light and has 3 microadjust holes.



To address the elephant in the room - the Cadisin is a near 1:1 copy of the Helm, and not having to do original designs allows them to sell their products significantly cheaper. This ethical discussion is not the intent of this discussion and I own both so I can't claim any moral high ground. To paraphrase the late Virgil Abloh, you know you’ve made it when they start counterfeiting your stuff. So as much as I hate to see one of my favorite microbrands get their design ripped wholesale, its a testament to their success and I’ll continue to support Helm as a brand.



On to the comparison - off the bat, I have to say the Cadisen Aqua diver is going to be the more wearable watch for most people. The 15.5mm height, especially with the stout diameter, gives the Helm a very hefty feel, whereas the Cadisen wears much more like a traditional 40mm dive watch. Dial is going to be subjective - the silver/white of the Cadisen is different from the Matte of the Helm, and they both look good. Lume is no contest, Helm by a mile and the pics will show why. Crystal on the Helm has better clarity and AR coating, but is part of the 15.5mm stack that is the Komodo. I prefer the bezel feel of the Helm, but some may enjoy the fidget factor of the light action of the Cadisen more. Bracelet and clasp again go to the Helm, they are well weighted and balance the heft of the watch head well. The Cadisen is lighter and just doesn’t have the solid feel of the Helm - it's also harder to dial in a good fit with the 3 microadjustments on the clasp. But credit where credit is due, the bracelet is perfectly wearable and the endlinks are solid and there's no rattle. 



They are both good watches at their price point and I think offer tremendous value. I’m not writing these reviews to give consumer advice because there are plenty of people who do that already; I’m here to share my thoughts on my collection journey and talk about watches I like. So, with that being said, I’ll close this piece with another story. I thought that when I got my hands on the Helm I would get rid of the Cadisen - I bought it as a place holder in my collection after all. But I have kids. And they already are picking up on the watch bug - they like helping dad pick out his watch of the day, picking out straps from the big box of NATOs, and they already have a few cheap kids watches. Eventually, if everything goes according to plan, they are going to want to wear a watch that matches dad’s. I’ll be holding on to this for that moment.

1ol0ww0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ol0ww0/aio_to_my_boyfriend_saying_he_doesnt_take_me_out/,AIO to my boyfriend saying he doesn’t take me out on dates because I have an eating disorder,"My boyfriend (m26) and I (f21) have been together for a year and a half but we have been in each others lives for about 2 and a half years. Throughout our relationship he has not been the best at planning dates or giving gifts, two things that are very important to me. 

We have discussed this multiple times, any of the important anniversaries, holidays etc I’m always giving more thoughtful gifts and planning dates, I often pay for most of our dates as well. 
 We almost broke up over the summer due to him not planning anything for my birthday 

Before I get accused of being materialistic I have verbally affirmed that free or low cost dates / gifts mean just as much if not more to me, it’s really about the thought and effort. 

He recently dropped the ball on him planning dates for us again, big time and we discussed, I think that I am considering breaking up, I love him so much but I can’t keep having the same conversations with no change, i feel very undervalued. He affirms me verbally very very  well but there is no action after that. 

His newest point was that he feels as if he cannot plan anything for us because lately I often decline/refuse going out to eat due to my ongoing battle with an eating disorder. 

I personally feel like this is incredibly insensitive and purposeful in trying to place blame on me. I have given many detailed examples of dates he could take me on, coffee shops I want to try, record stores, parks, seasonal festivals, eating out is not the only option for taking your girlfriend out on a date in my opinion, and he knows that because I often plan and pay for us to do similar things as I just listed. 

I want to revisit this conversation but I’m considering ending our relationship (which I really do not want to do) I just feel like I’ve tried everything to get a little effort but it doesn’t seem to work. 
Am I overreacting or is this a valid point for him to make? 


TLDR; my boyfriend refuses to plan any dates ever but when we recently discussed he said he won’t plan anything because I will decline going on dinner dates due to my eating disorder.

Before I get further into this review, I’d like to share a bit about my entry to the hobby of watch collection (and obsession). At the time I was slinging lattes for a well known coffee chain. Thanks to a combination of Reddit, watchuseek forum posts, and Instagram, I began to develop a thirst for the finer things in the watch collecting world. A Tudor taste on a Timex budget, Panerai preference on a Pagani Design Paycheck. These were unobtainable, but I still needed a watch and it had to be an automatic. After much deliberation and advice from kind internet strangers, I made my first watch purchase - the venerable sxk007. I could wax poetic about how amazing the watch is, how it will never leave my collection, etc. but to put a point on it, I was a kid who had found a hobby they wanted to participate in and was able to do so because there was an affordable option, and a damn good one to boot. If the hobbies we love are to continue to grow, they need to remain accessible to the next generation.

We were all laughing, because after all, we wouldn't download a car. IYKYK, you had to be for it. That latte slinging kid is older and debatably wiser, but there is still a streak of that punk rock ethos from his formative years.



And now we can move on to the recipe for grandma's secret cornbread. I mean the watches. 



Helm was founded in 2014 and has somewhat of a cult following. Initially stationed in the USA, they are now based in Hong Kong. Their unapologetically bulky design language and functional tool watch ethos isn't for everybody and that's ok - not everyone has to like everything. I’m a huge fan of the brand, and prior to the release of the three Togiak variants this August, I owned a variation of every watch in their lineup. Their watches are only available for purchase through a waitlist or lottery system - it is still a small operation and they produce a limited number of watches each month. Their watches also pop up on the secondary market, and trade at slightly above or below retail depending on condition. Depending on the model, they cost between $295-$375+ shipping, and if you want a massive slab of titanium or steel around your wrist, I don't think there is better value out there.. Despite being such a small company, Helms customer service is top tier, their QC is excellent, and they stand behind their products.



Cadisen was established in 2013 in Shenzhen, China, and other than that, I know next to nothing about the brand that isn't listed on their website. Their catalog consists mostly of homages with a few original designs sprinkled in, and they are on sale frequently on AliExpress for between $50-$100.



On to the specs: the Helm Komodo is 40mm in diameter, 45mm including the crown, and has a lug to lug of 47mm. The height, including the domed sapphire crystal, is a massive 15.5mm. The case is made of 316L steel and has a brushed finish. There is a signed screw down crown with crown guards that sweep gently out from the case. In my configuration, the dial is a matte white surrounded by a matching chapter ring. The indices, hands, and bezel are all a pale blue and color matched well. The 120 click bezel is lumed on all markers and turning it is stiff but not overly so; it requires intent to operate and feels like a true tool watch. From a tactile perspective, the clicks are snappy and loud.  Helm is well known for their lume and this watch is no exception: All lumed components glow brightly with BWG9 for hours and the lumed date wheel is a nice touch. It is powered by the NH35 movement and costs $295 + shipping. The watch is ISO 6425 compliant, meaning it meets certain durability criteria, and boasts a water resistance of 300m. The bracelet is in a simple single link style but is solid, articulates well, has snug fitting end links, and a milled clasp that balances the heft of the watch head and has 5 microadjust holes. 



The Cadisen Aqua Diver is 40mm in diameter, and has a lug to lug of 45mm. The height is 12.5mm including the flat sapphire crystal. The case is made of 316L steel and has a brushed finish. There is a signed screw down crown with crown guards that sweep gently out from the case. The dial and chapter ring on the Aqua Diver are a metallic white vs the matte of the Komodo. The blue color scheme of the Komodo is also present, but in a darker shade of blue. If you’re a F1 fan I’d say the bezel especially is fairly close to the Mercedes/Petronas livery. The 120 click bezel turns with very minimal resistance, and is much lighter both in terms of volume and operation. As for lume - only the 12-o-clock pip has any. The hands have decently bright blue lume but the indices only give the faintest suggestion of a glow. It is powered by the NH35 movement and I was able to snag it on sale for around $50. It claims a 100m water resistance.. The bracelet is in a simple single link style, articulates well, has snug fitting end links, and a milled clasp that is very light and has 3 microadjust holes.



To address the elephant in the room - the Cadisin is a near 1:1 copy of the Helm, and not having to do original designs allows them to sell their products significantly cheaper. This ethical discussion is not the intent of this discussion and I own both so I can't claim any moral high ground. To paraphrase the late Virgil Abloh, you know you’ve made it when they start counterfeiting your stuff. So as much as I hate to see one of my favorite microbrands get their design ripped wholesale, its a testament to their success and I’ll continue to support Helm as a brand.



On to the comparison - off the bat, I have to say the Cadisen Aqua diver is going to be the more wearable watch for most people. The 15.5mm height, especially with the stout diameter, gives the Helm a very hefty feel, whereas the Cadisen wears much more like a traditional 40mm dive watch. Dial is going to be subjective - the silver/white of the Cadisen is different from the Matte of the Helm, and they both look good. Lume is no contest, Helm by a mile and the pics will show why. Crystal on the Helm has better clarity and AR coating, but is part of the 15.5mm stack that is the Komodo. I prefer the bezel feel of the Helm, but some may enjoy the fidget factor of the light action of the Cadisen more. Bracelet and clasp again go to the Helm, they are well weighted and balance the heft of the watch head well. The Cadisen is lighter and just doesn’t have the solid feel of the Helm - it's also harder to dial in a good fit with the 3 microadjustments on the clasp. But credit where credit is due, the bracelet is perfectly wearable and the endlinks are solid and there's no rattle. 



They are both good watches at their price point and I think offer tremendous value. I’m not writing these reviews to give consumer advice because there are plenty of people who do that already; I’m here to share my thoughts on my collection journey and talk about watches I like. So, with that being said, I’ll close this piece with another story. I thought that when I got my hands on the Helm I would get rid of the Cadisen - I bought it as a place holder in my collection after all. But I have kids. And they already are picking up on the watch bug - they like helping dad pick out his watch of the day, picking out straps from the big box of NATOs, and they already have a few cheap kids watches. Eventually, if everything goes according to plan, they are going to want to wear a watch that matches dad’s. I’ll be holding on to this for that moment.

So as much as I hate to see one of my favorite microbrands get their design ripped wholesale, its a testament to their success and I’ll continue to support Helm as a brand.



On to the comparison - off the bat, I have to say the Cadisen Aqua diver is going to be the more wearable watch for most people. The 15.5mm height, especially with the stout diameter, gives the Helm a very hefty feel, whereas the Cadisen wears much more like a traditional 40mm dive watch. Dial is going to be subjective - the silver/white of the Cadisen is different from the Matte of the Helm, and they both look good. Lume is no contest, Helm by a mile and the pics will show why. Crystal on the Helm has better clarity and AR coating, but is part of the 15.5mm stack that is the Komodo. I prefer the bezel feel of the Helm, but some may enjoy the fidget factor of the light action of the Cadisen more. Bracelet and clasp again go to the Helm, they are well weighted and balance the heft of the watch head well. The Cadisen is lighter and just doesn’t have the solid feel of the Helm - it's also harder to dial in a good fit with the 3 microadjustments on the clasp. But credit where credit is due, the bracelet is perfectly wearable and the endlinks are solid and there's no rattle. 



They are both good watches at their price point and I think offer tremendous value. I’m not writing these reviews to give consumer advice because there are plenty of people who do that already; I’m here to share my thoughts on my collection journey and talk about watches I like. So, with that being said, I’ll close this piece with another story. I thought that when I got my hands on the Helm I would get rid of the Cadisen - I bought it as a place holder in my collection after all. But I have kids. And they already are picking up on the watch bug - they like helping dad pick out his watch of the day, picking out straps from the big box of NATOs, and they already have a few cheap kids watches. Eventually, if everything goes according to plan, they are going to want to wear a watch that matches dad’s. I’ll be holding on to this for that moment.

First round.

There was a jumper that I'd looked at a few days ago on AI (had to fiddle the DOM to be able to order because, fashion).

A bird feeder - I ordered a feeder pole a few days ago and commented in the review that it was a shame there was no feeder.

Walkie talkies for adults - I'd ordered ones for kids in the past.

There are also travel body wash sheets that might be quite nice (I'e ordered soap before), but I passed on those. Also a DP splitter, but I've enough of those.

Then I refreshed.

Coffee packets - not ordered coffee previously, but I've bought an aero press, and a while back ordered round filters on Vine.

Cat poo bags - it knows we have a cat, and I've ordered Vine dog bags before, useful for picking up daily presents from cat.

Ski goggles - I commented in a review a few days ago that I used ski goggles to protect from UV exposure related to a product. I've never given any hints of ski related activity before as we don't ski (goggles were for dog sledding in Norway a few years ago, and great for protection when using UV at home).

So now several RFY items that tie to review comments, as well as better targeting in general that some of us have been seeing. From comments it seems that people's experiences still vary significantly, but perhaps it gives some hope to those who are disillusioned in this regard.",2,1761931569.0,AmazonVineUK,2,0.75,False

A few highlights:

* **Texas Heritage Marketplace** — 165-acre development off I-10 & Texas Heritage Parkway, bringing restaurants, shops, trails, and outdoor green space. First openings expected 2026.
* **North Italia** — joining LaCenterra at Cinco Ranch early 2026 (handmade pasta, upscale-casual vibe).
* **Pappasito’s Cantina** — breaking ground late 2025 near I-10.
* **Whataburger + H-E-B** — coming to the Morton Ranch corridor.
* **Katy Asian Town** — adding new dessert and coffee cafés this fall.

It’s amazing to see Katy growing while still keeping that community feel that’s made it such a great place to live.

I hope I can rely on this subreddit for a moment to see if I'm losing it on this one. 

Today, on the way to work, my spouse (32nb) and I were talking about how a lot of teachers in the area where I work would be going to Dunkin for Munchkins, as it's Halloween. He was giving me a ride, since my car broke down in September, I'm stuck, pretty much, being given rides.  As a former employee, my partner was expressing frustration that people don't call ahead to set up things like that. I said that maybe more people would, if they knew that was polite/an option even. I used the example of cast dinners from when I had done theater, and that we had often arrived at restaurants with a large group without calling ahead and had next to no problems (the main example being a waiter who had talked poorly about my friends and I and refused to service because we were teens/kids, the biggest complaint being that my friend had asked for water, so she could take her meds). 

The conversation turned from how it would be difficult to try and go buy coffee to I personally was part of the problem.  I mentioned that I had not really had control over where we went, since most of my examples were from when I was in high school.  As their frustration seemed to ramp up, I made a mistake in trying to ask a hypothetical -- one using the plural ""you"" (as in people who are frustrated by people doing bulk orders or group tables without calling ahead).  They didn't let me finish and instead started growing angry with that, telling me that I was manipulating the conversation, particularly when I tried to clarify that I hadn't meant THEM in particular.  

  
This continued long enough that I got frustrated too and said that it was a good thing they knew me so well, they didn't even need me to be part of the conversation. (Note: I know this is a shitty thing to say, but it's also, unfortunately, true, so in my unfiltered state, I ended up saying it). They told me that I was throwing a fit and continued to accuse me of various problematic/abusive behaviors until we arrived at my job. I said that I'd prefer to talk about this later when we're calmer and started gathering my things. They said that I was sulking because I was letting my BPD take over (a common comment when I try to defuse the situation or stand up for myself). I said that I didn't feel that that was the case for me. I also said (and I know this was shitty), that maybe they should look into their own diagnosis. At this point, I shut the door and went into work. 

  
They texted me several times with various accusations, and since I have a pretty stressful job and I really didn't want to fight anymore, I set a boundary: I'd reach out in a few hours to see if they wanted to talk.  They weren't interested at first, telling me to take an Uber home/to come back down, and give back the costume they'd lent me, ETC. I googled how to de-escalate with a narcissist and pretty much included the recommended phrases word for word. They eventually calmed down (though not before making some comment about how they have a personality outside of me (unlike me, whose personality is reliant on their existence). 

I guess what I'm asking is (as a TL;DR) were they justified in being upset with how I addressed my initial question/ the conversation or is this problematic behavior?",1,1761931243.0,abusiverelationships,0,1.0,False

the reason this fucks with me however is there's not really any alternative to staying home for me
i did get invited & whatnot but i cant go

some context: i built up like a handful of friends in uni over the last year or so which is cool. up until my best friend decided to consistently attempt to manipulate my family & me to break up with my girlfriend because she wanted me, and after that didn't work she went around spreading rumors around me to everybody. im a grown ass 20 yr old man. my balls sag. i got chest hair and a job bro what is this middle school shit 
anyway one half of my friendgroup is completely losing their shit. hookups & coke w/ no future outlook genuinely just rotting i keep hearing rumors abt friend x and friend y waking up in the ER. the other half is being made to hate me because ms. idgafifhesmarriedimcrackingthat didn't know relationships r actually something ur supposed to gaf about.

i am so fucking alienated from everything man. i work a part time job in a tech firm whilst in university just trying to learn and grow, i got my parents depending on me. i had a semi-successful and fulfilling art and music thing going on. i want to read and learn about new things. i want to debate and read philosophers with friends that actually have their shit together. i dont care if that makes me an elitist i just want to not be the group therapist/only guy with any future prospects at this point. due to this shit i have spent the last 4-5 months of my life completely shut indoors. this is not a first either. i have high functioning autism, and so i am not very good at concealing my intent when i talk to people. so far every time i interact with another person i fall into three outcomes
1. the person listens to my blabbering with intent and interest and takes a liking to me until they fall for me, treat me like an older brother or father figure or therapist. just depending on me in any sort of way
2. the person uses me for their gain because i had the nerve to be honest and open
3. the person ignores me

for all my life loneliness has been the motor of my actions. all of my music and all of my art center around the feelings of loneliness, otherness and alienation. on paper i am doing wonderful and i have a bright future ahead of me. i just can't do it anymore. the only reason i keep myself going right now is because there's something human and real about this experience. it feels like surviving, like something real. 
i stand at the precipice of my own lonely little island looking into the far-away metropolis and sometimes boats from there will stop over. they offer to take me away into the drama and excitement of the big city. they tell me i will never have to think about tending to my island again. some come, fuel up and go. only my wife has so far actually cared for the island itself. if i could have one wish, it's to have a handful of visitors. a friendly greeting, a cup of coffee before i send them off into their own homes. they will return sometime after. we meet on equal footing. from human to human

You couldn’t help but feel how badass the Americans, British, French, even sometimes the Germans, all in their own unique ways. Each main fighter reflected the military culture well during that time period:

The main American character is a tough, loud-mouthed, hot-headed, salt-of-the-Earth man with a creative intuition beneath that, which if you read the testimonials of that time, is exactly who the British commonly described when fighting alongside Americans.

The main British character is another high-minded, mild-mannered, potentially giving off snobby, arrogant, or pretentious vibes to certain people, (“loquacious types”) who were seen as somewhat stuffy, and not at all what you’d expect from warriors, but when shit hit the fan they were surprisingly fierce, impressing The American soldiers according to *their* testimonials.

And the main French character is a solid representation of The French Resistance, the main fighting force left after the French Army crumbled: Desperate, fierce, creative, but exuding their dignified French civility in-front of The Enemy, not only showing that their spirit and culture remains unbroken even under Nazi occupation, but also perpetually throwing the Nazis off and leaving the Nazis unprepared for when a placcid frenchwoman might have just seduced you in a coffee shop to sink a knife in you at her house.

Meanwhile I think it’s cool that we get both perspectives of the Germans, especially between Landa and Bridget. One side represents the casual, cold, calculated barbarism of the Nazi regime. It poses as sophisticated and civilized, as well as intelligent and cunning, but is truly just the bloodiest, senseless, and opportunistic side of human nature incarnate. (The top Nazis even tried to kill/blow eachother up, like Landa did. There’s no honor amongst criminals.) While Bridget represents the Germans freed from the insane dogma of Nazism. Sophisticated, passionate, intelligent, and infinitely interesting just like many Germans of that time who were simply *acting* as pro-Nazi to avoid the wrath of Hitler’s police state.

There's a chalky sweetness clinging to the claws, cream gone cold and dusty, the chilled incense of snowy little footprints preserved in ice.

[**Interview with the Lovebat** ](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/bats-all-folks/interview-with-the-lovebat-perfume-oil/)(*pink strawberries floating in sparkling blood orange and French lime fizz, enveloped in a swooshy cape of black velvet plum*) Cartoon-bright citrus fizzing with fruit-punch pandemonium, the unhinged glee of Marge Simpson and Linda Belcher getting day drunk on gin-gimlets sprinkled with pop rocks and Nerds and deciding they're starting a cult or a band or maybe both, their vision board includes glitter, all the cutest pictures of Gene Wilder, and at least seven different shades of pink highlighter.

[**Hiss & Hearse**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/wild-hearses/hiss-hearse-perfume-oil/) (*a dribble of Dorian and a squiggle of Snake Oil, delicately stirred with a moss-crusted muddy shovel*) Sugar-cubed breakfast tea staining antique lace, a doily dropped and ground into cemetery mud, delicate embroidery work sodden with petrichor and root rot. Something powdery-sweet that should be refined and parlor-proper now caked in wet earth, the smell of a Victorian burial shroud exhumed after a heavy rain, still clinging to its faded elegance even as soil crusts the hems. Graveyard loam sweetened with the ghost of afternoon service, bone china teacups filled with dirt.

[**Witch Flash**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/halloween-flash-sheet/witch-flash-perfume-oil/) (*tattoo ink infused with sorcerous roots and heady incense*). The blackest black that light refuses to touch, proprietary darkness jealously guarded, Vantablack if it grew roots and got tangled in underground electrical wiring. Dank sour earth threaded with something chemical and adhesive, the smell of vinyl insulation wrapped around ancient woody resins, rubbery and sharp and deliberately strange. A color so black it's basically a monopoly, a void so deliberately crafted it feels witchy by sheer force of absorbing everything around it, turning incense smoke into something industrially arcane and territorially weird.

[**Skeleton Flash**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/halloween-flash-sheet/skeleton-flash-perfume-oil/) (polished bone shards, scorched sandalwood and tattoo ink) The other end of that proprietary spectrum, what happens when you develop the negative and all that jealously-guarded darkness flips to stark white light. Bare canvas stretched over scorched wood, primer coat before the ink goes in, the erasure that comes before creation. Bleached cotton, chalk dust, correction fluid painted over mistakes, clinical and clean. The empty space, the blank page, a more fraught and unforgiving reckoning than being lost in the dark, somehow more existentially annihilating than staring down the void.

[**I've Got Out At Last**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/the-yellow-wallpaper/ive-got-out-at-last-perfume-oil/) (*torn paper revealing scorched plaster embedded with bitter citron, yellow grapefruit, and damp white cedar)* Perfect citrus segments arranged on a plate you can only see through iron bars, the breezy morning light cruel in its beauty. Grapefruit pith papery and bitter, dried allium flowers, pale purple pompoms translucent and slightly vegetal and musky-sharp, the detritus of something once fresh now aged into brittleness. That texture of things left to desiccate in captivity, the ghost of brightness viewed through obstruction, just the bitter rind of it pressed against your tongue.

[**Batty Lace** ](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/bats-all-folks/batty-lace-2025-perfume-oil/)(*a leathered up, musky interpretation of Antique Lace*) Bela Lugosi's Dead run through a sticky-syruped tape deck, caramel-amber static, cotton candy spun through patchouli interference, sweet pop frequencies cutting to Motörhead grinding through blown speakers, then Sisters of Mercy cathedral-goth reverb deep and dark. Every time you think you've locked onto one signal, the transmission cuts out, and it shifts into something completely contradictory, soft Pink Pony Club sweetness short-circuits into something bass-heavy and shadowed and back again. \[*EDIT: Ha! I guess I reviewed this in 2023, too. Here is what I said, ""The caramel aspect of this blend is what I notice most, a buttery-milky brown sugar caramel that wants to ooze over vanilla ice cream rather than firm up into fudgy squares. Shifting beneath the caramel are those faint, faded attic-trunk florals and creamy cobwebby linens I recall from Antique Lace and a cracked leather buckle so ghostly and elusive I’m not sure if it was actually ever there at all.""\]*

[**Dead Leaves and Skin Musk**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/pile-of-leaves-2025/dead-leaves-and-skin-musk-perfume-oil/) *(no notes listed)* Soap bubbles catching October's dying light, the way autumn evenings used to stretch infinite even as they ended early, time moving differently when someone else kept track of it for you. Steam rising from water drawn by someone's hands you'll never see again in this lifetime, that drowsy warmth after hours spent kicking through leaf piles, the exhaustion of childhood translated through clean suds and amber dusk. Bath time as the day collapses into early darkness, warm and safe and somehow unbearably tender in retrospect.

[**Interminable Grotesques**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/the-yellow-wallpaper/interminable-grotesques-perfume-oil/) (*narcissus blooms lolling on broken stems, their buttery perfume swelling into a debased crescendo of honeyed heliotrope, toxic lily of the valley, almond blossom, and opium poppy*) Honeyed and narcotic, the kind of dizzying pareidolia where you keep almost seeing something recognizable before it dissolves back into confused blooms. Marzipan shaped into wedding cake flowers, perfect and poisonous, the immediate wrongness of food mimicking flora mimicking food. Almond ghost-flickering through a blanket of heavy white petals, there for a second, then gone, sweetness piled on sweetness until it becomes a hypnotic spiraling, beautiful in that specific way that makes you slightly sick.

[**Dia de los Muertos** ](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/in-memoriam/halloween/halloween-2023/ween-perfume-oil/)(*dry, crackling leaves, the incense smoke of altars honoring Death and the Dead, funeral bouquets, the candies, chocolates, foods and tobacco of the ofrenda, amaranth, sweet cactus blossom and desert cereus)* A dream, a classroom, you hear your name, but it's coming from both inside the lesson and outside the door. ""The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead/ Did squeak and gibber...were it not that I have bad dreams,"" intones a distant voice, fading. Death wrapped in vinyl, a smear in a shower curtain, a red, red hand pressed against the film. A trail of something slick and sticky, honeyed tobacco, a fruity resin, and sweet, grassy, dried blooms in its wake. A shape beckons through the barrier, a dread, phantom thing in wrapped plastic, calling from beyond the corner, and you're walking toward it —you can't stop walking toward it.

[**Cherry Cola Hearse**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/wild-hearses/cherry-cola-hearse-perfume-oil/) (*fizzy pop and a syrupy slick of motor oil splashed across disintegrating tan leather seat)* Waxy cherry candy stretched into ropes, dense chocolate-adjacent chew that's not quite chocolate, the slick pomade perfection of Kennickie's hair catching light in the rearview mirror (""A hickey from Kenickie is like a Hallmark card, when you only care enough to send the very best!"") Fake-fruit plasticky Twizzler sweetness, Tootsie Roll richness, everything polished with product and oily swagger, neon light shine and candy-slick confidence.

[**Hearse of Pancakes** ](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/wild-hearses/hearse-of-pancakes-perfume-oil/)(*black coffee, syrup-drenched buckwheat cakes, and a crusty cruller for the road*) One of my brothers-in-law is a bit of a coffee enthusiast (also a bit of a snob, but that's not important to the story) and he drags us to every cafe and coffeeshop he can find whenever the family is all together. This smells exactly like what he orders, or some version of it: cafe mocha and a pastry, bitter-chocolate darkness meeting sugar-glazed fried dough. He's Icelandic, so he usually goes for the cream cake option, but this is my rose-tinted glasses recollection of those afternoons I've spent at small tables while he evaluates the beans, the roast, the crema, and I just smell this exact combination over and over until it becomes the scent of family obligation turned oddly tender and sweet.

[**The Woman Behind it**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/the-yellow-wallpaper/the-woman-behind-it-perfume-oil/) (*silvered lavender and white iris shuddering like lamplight on stained plaster, ambergris frothing through vanilla husk, and the phantom outline of a rose-touched woman’s silhouette)* Sneaking into Deborah Turbeville's Unseen Versailles, elegant ghost stories and hazy hallucinations of antique decadence. A sliver of lavender soap worn translucent, the waxy trace of vintage lipstick on forgotten drinking glasses, pale powdery woods exhaling through dust-shrouded chambers. Those fleeting witnesses—hairpins, papers, cosmetics left in neglected storage rooms—so delicate an open window might blow them all away. The specific scent of beauty rituals frozen mid-performance, isolation and romanticism suspended in abandoned gilt, the haunting intimacy and immersion of faded grandeur where pristine splendor once might have kept you behind velvet ropes.

[**Dead Leaves and a Woolly Jumper.**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/pile-of-leaves-2025/dead-leaves-and-a-wooly-jumper-perfume-oil/) *(no notes listed)* The main character from some isekai anime I'm making, totally making up just for this perfume review, but if someone writes the screenplay, they'd better give me credit! ""I Died Choking on Strawberry Milk Pocky and Got Reincarnated as the Autumn Demon Queen."" Dead leaves crushed underfoot, meeting kawaii streetwear: the crunchy vegetation of seasonal decay paired with fuzzy pink cable-knit and cartoon-animal faces. She's supposed to preside over fall and mortality but shows up to every council meeting in a patchwork sweater with bunnies on it, strawberry milk powder dusting her sleeves, strawberry marshmallow mochi in her pockets, strawberry white choco latte in her baby pink Stanley cup, pastel in a world of russet and rot, autumn trying its best to be taken seriously while its demon queen insists on being adorable. (I'll be honest, [this sweater](https://myjapanclothes.com/cdn/shop/files/japanese-rabbit-pull_2_grande.jpg?v=1728904545) inspired this entire review.)

That chemical brightness that tastes nothing like actual limes but everything like the Platonic ideal of citrus translated through laboratory genius. An electric emerald conjuring that appears in jelly beans, gummy bears, snow cones, Jello molds, Freezee pops, a green that only exists in artificial form, nature could never! La fée verte viridian visions granted not through wormwood but through whatever makes lime lifesavers taste like that, like chartreuse and shamrock make you feel, impossibly, deliriously green.

This is the absolute, exquisite embodiment of the best Kool-Aid recipe ever, courtesy that one scene in *Slumber Party Massacre*: one package of Kool-Aid (ultra-pink, berried chaos, fruit-punch-adjacent) and seven heaping cups of sugar dissolved into a scant tablespoon of water.

Something sour and unwashed, cheesy and human, the physical cost of disappearing into your work. From across the room it's intriguing, that particular musk of someone deep in the zone, but up close it's almost repellent—the reality of bodies neglected in service of making something. Where do we go when we're like that? What liminal space swallows us whole, spits us out days later blinking and disoriented? You leave your body there, or it leaves you, time moves differently or doesn't move at all. You emerge with paint under your fingernails, ink stains blooming across your palms, the ghost of ideas still clinging to your hair. The work gets done but you can't remember eating, sleeping, the basic maintenance of being alive. You've been somewhere else entirely, some fevered creative underworld where the only thing that matters is finishing, completing, manifesting whatever's been clawing at your insides demanding to exist. This is what that place smells like—not the glossy fantasy of the tortured artist, but the actual funk of artistic sin. Stale breath and forgotten meals, skin gone sour from stress hormones and tunnel vision, clothes worn too many days in a row because changing them would mean acknowledging the outside world still exists. The sourness of someone who's been burning themselves as fuel, converting flesh and sleep and sanity into something tangible, something real. You bring back the work, yes, but also this smell, this evidence of the sacrifice, proof you went somewhere most people won't follow because it costs too much to stay there. The dry down smells like the finished work itself, an earthy elegance polished by multiple drafts and a diligent editor, refined into something presentable... but underneath runs an insistent current, the indelible signature of the creator's weird funk.",13,1761930672.0,Indiemakeupandmore,3,0.93,False

Before you sign a single legal document, split a single share of equity, or quit your day job, you put the cofounder relationship on a 90 day trial.

This isn’t about friendship or good vibes over coffee. That stuff is worthless under pressure. This is a deliberate stress test to see if you can actually build something together without killing each other.

I’ve seen best friends of 10 years start a company and become mortal enemies in 6 months. Why? Because the stress of a startup exposes every crack. Misaligned work ethics, terrible communication, different ideas of what “done” means. Your friendship chemistry means nothing when you’re about to miss payroll.

So here’s how you avoid the most common startup killer.

First, define a single, concrete goal for the next 90 days. Not “change the world.” Something real, like “build a functional prototype and get 10 paying users.” Then, write down who is responsible for what. Who is the final decision maker on product? On marketing? Have the uncomfortable conversation now.

Next, run a two week sprint on a tiny project. Build a landing page and run a fifty dollar ad campaign. The goal isn't the outcome. The goal is to see how you both handle a deadline. What happens when the ads don't convert? Does one person shut down? Do you start blaming each other? This tiny test will tell you more than a year of talking.

Then, you intentionally introduce conflict. I’m serious. Pick something you disagree on, like pricing strategy, and force a decision. The point isn’t to win the argument. The point is to see *how* you argue. Can you disagree respectfully and commit to a path forward, or does it become a passive aggressive nightmare? If you can’t survive a small, manufactured argument now, you are completely screwed when real money and pressure are involved.

At the end of the 90 days, you have a non emotional decision to make.

1.  Commit. Things worked. You survived the tests. Now you can talk equity and legal docs.
2.  Adjust. The core is good but there are issues. Redefine roles.
3.  Walk away. This is the most valuable outcome. You just saved yourself a year of your life, thousands in legal fees, and a broken friendship. Walking away is a win.

Stop listening to gurus who tell you to just ""find someone you vibe with."" That's how you end up with a 65% failure rate. Your startup isn't a friendship. It's a high stakes business partnership, and it should be treated like one from day one.

TBH, there’s more to HSF than their scholarships, and you’re leaving a ton of opportunities on the table if you don’t try to make the most of your designation as a scholar. I think these resources could 100% give someone an advantage within their career, and I’d hate for someone (who otherwise wouldn’t have access to such opportunities) to miss out on it because they saw people in this subreddit call HSF a “scam”

1) HSF hosts Summits dedicated to specialized career tracks (ex: finance, sports & media, etc). I applied to and attended a multitude of them. My flights and hotels were paid for by HSF, and at these summits I had access to fellow HSF scholars, mentors, and staff. Another major perk is how you get in-person networking opportunities with recruiters and executives from their corporate partners. It’s not rare for an HSF scholar to leave this conference with a direct path to an internship’s final interview, or even a formal offer. I typically would get applications to apply for these summits, but there were times where I’d message HSF staff via the “messaging center” in the HSF portal and they’d let me know when applications would go out / send me the application link

2) Hsf has newsletters filled with opportunities from their partners, and oftentimes HSF scholars get special access to these applications ahead of broader distribution. Don’t underestimate those newsletters!

3) The network you’re added into as a scholar is truly world class. My fondest memories from my time as a scholar came from the relationships I built with fellow scholars, mentors, alumni, and staff. As a scholar, I’d always reach out to HSF alumni on LinkedIn who were in careers I aspired to be in. Now, as an alumni, I’m always having coffee chats with the scholars who reach out to me with the questions I had before. You never know when someone you met at a summit, or even virtually on LinkedIn, is going to change your life!

4) I’ve been able to chat 1:1 with staff and they’re truly the most caring, dedicated individuals. Besides being accessible on LinkedIn, they’re also active in the “message center” of the HSF portal. I think this point is often forgotten about too: HSF has a team dedicated to all things career prep. If you message that team on the portal for questions regarding resumes, interviews, or just general questions on finding opportunities, they’ll get back to you. 

I was bummed the first time I didn’t receive a monetary scholarship, don’t get me wrong. However, I think their leadership / professional development opportunities is what made me a standout candidate for other scholarships within my university, as well as a standout candidate for the roles I applied to and eventually accepted.

This was long winded, but I hope no one feels discouraged about the program. If you were designated an HSF scholar, you might as well use that to your advantage 😁

I've been pulling espresso shots with my Gemilai Owl G3006 and Gemilai G9010B grinder for a month now. I've tried different beans, mainly medium roast at a traditional 18g/36g ratio in 25-30s, and after a few trail and error, now most of time it went well.

Today I was using a Brazilian single origin medium roast when I noticed the extraction was super slow: 18g in, only 10g out in 30s. I adjusted the grind size coarser - big jump from 360um to 460um and if improved a little bit but was still sluggish. Then i noticed small holes on the edge of the coffee pucks (see picture), suggesting uneven distribution, so I tried stirring and tamping carefully. However, it still kept channeling on the edge! I used a different medium roast bean with exactly the same parameters and it well perfectly fine!

Now I start to wonder whether this has something to do with the beans? or what might the reason it keeps channeling with small holes on the edge even though I tried to distribute and tamp as even as possible?

I had my first afib episode about 6 weeks ago at the age of 33 right after my wedding. I was on little sleep, high stress, untreated OSA, three redbulls and many old fashioneds. 

I was cardioverted back into sinus rhythm and have been that way since. My echocardiogram came back normal in every sense. I have normal blood pressure normally.

I was originally put on eliquis and metoprolol (25mg twice a day) but after meeting with my EP he suggested waning off the meoprolol and stopping eliquis immediately. I get the eliquis since I’m a 0 level stroke risk but I’ve seen some studies that suggest metoprolol can help keep you out of an episode?

Any reason to try to stay on it or is it better to get off?

Overall I’m still coming to grips with the concept of not being able to drink alcohol. We had to reschedule my honeymoon at an all inclusive resort and now it seems like I’ll have to be sober the whole time. 

I was also originally told to stay off caffeine by one cardiologist but my EP told me it didn’t matter and I could drink coffee and caffeine as I see fit (maybe not redbull) 

Any guidance on metoprolol, alcohol and caffeine would be appreciated. Any anything else you suggest.

So I decided to take a break and see if I could meet someone naturally instead.

Then this guy at work started noticing me. We began talking more often, and he’d ask if I was going into the office (we do WFH sometimes) so he could join too. Two weeks ago, he asked me out for lunch just the two of us and we went. I felt so happy it was refreshing to have someone reach out the old fashioned way. Our banter was great, and I genuinely enjoyed his presence.

After that, I asked if he wanted to grab coffee sometime, and he said yes. Again, I felt so happy! We’ve texted here and there maybe once or twice a week. The texts weren’t dry, but they often ended with “have a good day” or “goodnight,” which was fine with me until it takes days for him to message me again.

Most advice I see says “go talk to him,” and I do! But it’s been five days since we last spoke from our coffee date. For context, On our first lunch date, we hadn’t talked for a few days either, but I initiated the coffee meetup and he agreed. Now that that’s over, there’s been no follow up or message from him.

He did mention on our first date that texting can sometimes be fun, but meeting up might feel different or vice versa. He said sometimes texting is bad but the dates are great. It’s confusing!

So now I’m wondering… should I just cut my losses and move on? Or is it worth keeping hope that he’ll reach out again? I feel a bit crazy overthinking this and could really use some advice 🥹 i cant stop thinking about him!

i mean it like my brain actually stopped cooperating.

the first 8 hour shift was fine. great actually.

i was in that zone  tabs everywhere, caffeine on tap, little dopamine hits every time something worked.

half way through the 2nd 8 hour shift, i was starting to trip over myself.

rethinking the same thing twice. forgetting variable names.  
by hour 8, the text on my screen was moving even when it wasn’t.

i’d drink more coffee and tell myself i had to push through it.

that was not it.

around the end of my 3rd 8 hour shift i tried to write a commit message and couldn’t form a sentence.

that’s when it clicked im not tired i have fried my own brain.

for a while i thought burnout was about long hours.  
but it’s not.

it’s what happens when your brain stops trusting you.  
when you push through every warning signal until it just literally shuts down to survive.

anyways.

i took a few days off, thinking rest would fix it.  
it didn’t. i still felt foggy, slow, off. unsure and unconfident.

so i started tinkering, not with code, with sound.

Goal: never hit burnout without taking days off.

i wanted to know if i could design something that pulled my brain back online faster.  
not meditate, not vibe, not “breathe deeper.”  
just reset.

i started mapping what overload looked like: heart rate up, breath shallow, focus gone.

then i started building sound around that.  
layering frequencies, silence gaps, pacing like rhythm for the nervous system.  
testing it on myself in real time, mid spiral, mid fatigue.

it was weird at first.

then one night, after a long sprint, i ran one of the sound loops.  
ninety seconds later, i felt clarity snap back in.

my chest felt light almost like my lungs was breathing for the first time.  
not calm but like clear.

like the noise in my head just dropped out for a second and i could think again.

that moment changed how i build everything.

now when people ask what i’m working on, i tell them:  
i’m building reliefware, tools that get builders back online fast.

not wellness, not meditation.  
just systems that help you recover focus before burnout eats your progress.

because the internet loves to talk about output.  
but the real advantage isn’t speed.  
it’s recovery.

the founders who last aren’t the ones who grind hardest.  
they’re the ones who know how to come back quicker than they fall off.

if your brain’s been foggy lately, take it from me don’t wait for it to crash to learn how to reset.

Whole wheat bread was nowhere to be found. And worst of all, the coffee is prepared *torrefacto*, which basically means that the beans were roasted in sugar before being processed. That means that even if you ask for a coffee without sugar, there will still be some in it.

Here in the US, I have no problems finding healthy options at most restaurants or grocery stores. There is much lower temptation to buy freshly made pastries or fries snacks off the streets. And most of the big grocery stores serve fresh veggies and fruits year round.

Next, run a two week sprint on a tiny project. Build a landing page and run a fifty dollar ad campaign. The goal isn't the outcome. The goal is to see how you both handle a deadline. What happens when the ads don't convert? Does one person shut down? Do you start blaming each other? This tiny test will tell you more than a year of talking.

Then, you intentionally introduce conflict. I’m serious. Pick something you disagree on, like pricing strategy, and force a decision. The point isn’t to win the argument. The point is to see *how* you argue. Can you disagree respectfully and commit to a path forward, or does it become a passive aggressive nightmare? If you can’t survive a small, manufactured argument now, you are completely screwed when real money and pressure are involved.

At the end of the 90 days, you have a non emotional decision to make.

1.  Commit. Things worked. You survived the tests. Now you can talk equity and legal docs.
2.  Adjust. The core is good but there are issues. Redefine roles.
3.  Walk away. This is the most valuable outcome. You just saved yourself a year of your life, thousands in legal fees, and a broken friendship. Walking away is a win.

Stop listening to gurus who tell you to just ""find someone you vibe with."" That's how you end up with a 65% failure rate. Your startup isn't a friendship. It's a high stakes business partnership, and it should be treated like one from day one.

Ever wondered why some people effortlessly fly abroad while others stay rooted in their homeland?
Is it luck, karma, or cosmic geography?
Let’s decode this fascinating pattern — the astrological migration code.


✈️ 1️⃣ The 9th & 12th House Connection — The Cosmic Departure Gate

In Vedic astrology, the 9th house represents fortune, destiny, and long journeys.
The 12th house represents foreign lands, isolation, and liberation.
When these two connect through lords, aspects, or nakshatras, the chart whispers — “your soul will travel.”

For example:

Lagna lord in the 12th → native feels drawn to other cultures.
9th lord in the 12th → destiny opens through foreign experiences.
Jupiter or Venus influencing both → knowledge and love bloom abroad.
You can call it cosmic wanderlust.

🧭 2️⃣ Rahu — The Ultimate Foreigner

Rahu doesn’t understand borders.
Wherever Rahu touches, it dissolves limits — caste, country, or comfort zone.
If Rahu connects with your 9th, 10th, or 12th house, expect a life that moves beyond your postal code.
Rahu in the 9th gives the hunger to explore other ideologies;
Rahu in the 10th shifts your career across continents;
Rahu in the 12th creates fascination with life abroad — even if you never migrate physically, your mind always travels.
Rahu says: “Be more than where you were born.”


🌞 3️⃣ Sun, Mercury, and the “Recognition Factor”

Moving abroad isn’t just about distance — it’s about visibility.
When the Sun or Mercury rule or aspect the 9th/12th, the native’s recognition grows through communication, education, or professional excellence in a foreign setup.
Sun in the 9th or 12th → Government / multinational associations.
Mercury there → success through language, data, or negotiation skills.
Ever noticed how some Indians settle in UK or US and suddenly “shine”?
That’s Solar-Mercurial light finding a global stage.

💼 4️⃣ The 10th House Trigger — Career Abroad

The 10th is karmasthana — your workplace.
If the 10th lord joins or aspects 12th, your karma naturally flows to foreign lands.
Venus or Mercury as 10th lords often bring corporate or creative exposure abroad.

Example:
A Taurus ascendant with Saturn (career) in Pisces (12th) usually finds stability only after working in a structured system abroad — that’s karmic engineering at play.


💎 5️⃣ The Timing — When Planets Stamp Your Visa

You can have every “foreign combination” and still stay in Lucknow — until your dasha activates the promise.
Rahu–Venus or Rahu–Jupiter → travel / PR approvals / global projects.
Saturn–Jupiter → career relocation.
Mercury–Moon → short foreign stays for study or training.


Transit tip:
When Jupiter transits your 12th or aspects 9th/10th, your passport gets busy.
When Rahu transits 3rd/9th axis, opportunities knock from unexpected countries.


💫 6️⃣ But Not All Who Wander, Win

Here’s the twist most people miss:
Foreign stay isn’t always “progress.”
For some, it’s isolation, for others, evolution.
If the 12th lord is weak or afflicted, you may feel uprooted, not elevated.

Astrology doesn’t promise foreign success — it maps foreign experience. The outcome depends on your karmic maturity. That’s why two people go abroad one builds an empire, the other longs to come home.

🌙 7️⃣ The Emotional Migration — Moon’s Role

Moon decides how you “feel” about relocation.
Moon connected to Rahu, 9th or 12th makes you emotionally nomadic. You adapt quickly, love global diversity. But if Moon is afflicted or in fixed signs, your heart stays in the homeland even if you’re sipping coffee in London. Sometimes migration isn’t about place it’s about peace.


🔮 8️⃣ The Modern Karma: “Digital Abroad”

In this new age, even remote workers and digital creators live their 12th-house karma online. A person teaching astrology on Reddit from India but guiding clients in Europe?
That’s 12th house fulfilment in 5G form!
The universe doesn’t need airports anymore; only Wi-Fi and wisdom.


🕊️ 9️⃣ Remedies & Realignment

If your chart strongly points abroad but progress feels blocked:

1. Strengthen the 9th lord through donation and study.
2. Offer water to Sun for clarity in decision-making.
3. Travel East on Thursdays — symbolic activation of Jupiter’s expansion.
4. Keep learning foreign languages — Rahu loves adaptation.


Remember: destiny opens only when you prepare practically and spiritually.


✨ 10️⃣ Closing Thought

 “The stars don’t care for borders; they only care for evolution.” Some souls grow roots, others grow wings. If your chart whispers of motion, trust it. Lucknow or London — the destination doesn’t matter; the journey does. Because every mile you travel is a karmic classroom  and astrology, when read right, is the map of your soul’s passport.

1ol00v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1ol00v8/dont_forget_that_social_anxiety_is_your_chance/,Don't forget that social anxiety is your chance for a confidence win,"
Social anxiety isn’t rare. It’s everywhere. You see it in the person who overthinks what to say in a group chat, who replays every sentence said at yesterday’s coffee meetup, who walks into a room and immediately looks for the quietest corner. And yet, the internet is flooded with TikTok “confidence coaches” who scream “Just be confident!” like it's a light switch. Most of them have zero training in psychology. They just want views.

But social anxiety isn’t about being shy. It’s a neurobiological response tied to evolutionary survival systems. We’re wired to fear social rejection because, back in the day, being kicked out of the group literally meant death. Today it just feels like it. And while that sucks, here's the plot twist: social anxiety can be one of the most powerful tools for growth. If you learn to manage it right, it becomes a daily playground for leveling up confidence.

This isn’t from a single source. This is from peer-reviewed psych research, leading cognitive science books, and expert podcasts that break it all down. Here’s everything that actually helps ,  no BS, no generic “face your fears” advice.

Let’s dive in.

**Why social anxiety can actually be a superpower, if used right**

- People with social anxiety are often hyper-aware and observant. Dr. Ellen Hendriksen, author of *How to Be Yourself*, explains that socially anxious people tend to have high social intelligence,  they just overuse it.
- According to a meta-analysis published in *Current Psychiatry Reports*, those with social anxiety often score higher on traits like empathy and conscientiousness. That’s not a flaw. That’s a feature.
- This sensitivity means you're constantly scanning for patterns, energy shifts reactions. With training, that awareness can evolve into social mastery.

**Tools that actually work (and are backed by behavioral science)**

- *Cognitive defusion techniques*: From ACT therapy (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), this is about separating yourself from your thoughts. When your mind says “Everyone’s judging me,” you reply, “Thanks, brain. That’s a story you’re telling again.” It creates space so you’re not fused with that fear.
- *Exposure with intention*: Gradual, not forced. Stanford professor Dr. Philippe Goldin ran fMRI studies showing that repeated, structured exposure rewires the brain’s fear circuits. It’s not about flooding. It’s about micro-bravery moments,  small social risks you take daily, like asking for directions or making eye contact just 1 second longer.
- *Pre-event planning*: Social neuroscience researcher Matthew Lieberman found that when people write down their fears before a stressful event, their amygdala (fear center) calms down. Try journaling 5 minutes before a social scenario. It helps regulate your emotional response.

**Podcasts that go way deeper than surface confidence tips**

- *The Huberman Lab Podcast*: Dr. Andrew Huberman breaks down the neuroscience of fear, stress, and confidence. His episode on “How to rewire your brain for confidence” is packed with actionable biology-backed tips.
- *Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris*: Especially episodes with meditation teachers and psychologists who cover self-acceptance and fear of judgment. These aren't woo-woo. They’re practical and research-grounded.

**YouTube channels that don’t make you feel bad for being quiet**

- *Therapy in a Nutshell*: Run by a licensed therapist, this channel covers anxiety, self-worth, and how to reframe fear. Her videos on “What to do when you feel socially awkward” are gold.
- *Struthless*: A creative channel that covers identity, self-expression, and how to embrace your weird. Not made for extroverts. Made for real humans.

**Life-changing books for social anxiety and confidence building**

- *How to Be Yourself* by Ellen Hendriksen, PhD: This book made me angry I hadn’t read it sooner. She’s a clinical psychologist from Harvard Medical School and explains how social anxiety isn’t about being broken,  it’s about misinterpreting fear signals. This is hands-down the best book for anyone who wants to stop overanalyzing every interaction and actually show up. Feels like having a therapist in your pocket.
- *The Courage to Be Disliked* by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga: This bestseller from Japan (over 3.5 million copies sold) teaches Adlerian psychology through dialogues that make you question your need for approval. It’s deep, weird, and insanely good. This book will make you rethink every “what if they judge me?” thought.
- *Presence* by Amy Cuddy: Yes, she’s the “power pose” TED speaker. But the book goes way beyond that. It’s about how to embody confidence even when your brain is panicking. It’s rooted in behavioral science and social psychology. Not motivational fluff.

**Apps that help rewire your anxiety brain in small, daily ways**

- Insight Timer: A free meditation app with guided sessions specifically for social fear, self-compassion, and confidence. Great for pre-event calming and daily grounding work.
- BeFreed: This is an AI-powered learning app built by a Columbia University team. It turns expert-backed content,  books, psych research, interviews into a personalized audio learning plan based on your goals. You can choose your podcast length, tone, and even build your learning roadmap over time. It’s perfect if you’re working on overcoming social fears, building confidence, or just want to go deeper into behavioral psychology without reading 30 books. It also covers all the books and resources I mentioned above, so you can learn on the go.

**Quick daily practices that seriously build confidence**

- *The 3-second rule*: If you think about saying something or doing something socially, act within 3 seconds. Past that, your brain talks you out of it. This behavioral hack is used in exposure therapy for a reason.
- *Name it to tame it*: Label your anxiety out loud or in your head. “This is social fear kicking in.” Naming the emotion activates your prefrontal cortex and reduces the intensity. UCLA studies confirm this works.
- *Confidence journaling*: Write one social win per day, no matter how small. “I asked a follow-up question.” “I held eye contact.” Over time this creates a bank of proof that you are not socially broken,  you’re improving.

Social anxiety isn’t a flaw. It’s a nervous system doing its job a little too well. But when you learn to work with it, not against it, it becomes one of the best teachers for confidence, self-awareness, and emotional growth.

This is where the win happens.

1ol00f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ol00f9/her/,Her,"The fire cracked and split within the study. A warm room. Books nestled on oak shelves. Thick recliners with soft blankets. Two windows with healthy views of the trees and street below. The four men had paused their conversation. The fire did the talking now.

The youngest one stood to stare at the window, “We should tell someone. There has to be someone we can tell.”

The oldest one; a confident man who owned the home they know sat in shook his head, “We can’t. Who would we call? Who would believe us?”

The other two men nodded. All four men were respectable. Held prominent roles in business and leadership in the town. Laid claim to beautiful wives, pampered children and now grandchildren and elaborate homes. They wanted for nothing except tonight.

They wanted nothing more than tonight to be false. A trick. A coincidence. They wanted nothing more than tonight to be not be the night.

The fire cracked loudly. The younger man’s movement toward the window in the study stirred their conversation again. They felt confident in the study. Safe. Content from the outside. It was Halloween after all. The younger man watched the trees blow softly from a cool fall wind. Leaves changed and fell. A half moon glowed in and out of slow clouds.

The younger man noticed a fog rolling in the distance. Families were trick-or-treating in the posh neighborhood. He looked down on them from the second floor study with guilt. Fear.

“We could call the sheriff,” the younger man wouldn’t let it go.

“The Sheriff will be busy chasing teenagers and pranksters all night. And what we would we tell him? Evacuate the town? Say we are all in danger? Lay it out for him? At best he would laugh at us. At worst, he would put us in a psychiatric ward,” the oldest man groveled as he leaned by the brick fireplace. He poured several more fingers of whiskey.

One of the other men sitting chimed in, “We all knew this day would come. She said it would. We just didn’t know when. Hell, for a time we probably thought it wouldn’t happen. But here it is. We’ve done the best thing we can and brought our families here for a “party.” The rest will have to work itself out.”

The younger man shook his head as he talked. Frustrated. Anxious. Unyielding. We’re fools, he thought. Foolish to think we could get away with it. Fools to think we had power.

The last man who hadn’t spoken threw a question to the group, “Any chance there’s a coincidence? We are just reading into things? What happened at the Smith Farm could have been anyone. It doesn’t mean…”

The oldest man cut him off aggressively, “To hell with that. The Smith’s were good people. Old Man Smith taught us how to shoot when we were boys. Then that happens to them? Sheriff told me his deputies couldn’t process the scene. Disturbing is what he said. The sheriff! A man who has seen some things. Told me they were in pieces. All of them. No, that’s not a coincidence. And the others, too. Did we all forget that it happened on his land?”

They all nodded as the fire made a loud crack again. The soft burning providing welcome white noise to the scene. Four leaders of the town. Champions of the community. Now biding their time. Fearful. Their legacies, gains, success built from a single interaction. A deal. Had it been because of what they’d agreed with her? With it?

“Smith and his family were torn to pieces. Literally. Sheriff showed the district attorney the files and I saw ‘em. Nothing human could do that. And what about Miller’s horses? Half of them disappeared the other half mutilated? And the Kelly’s orchards and what happened down at the church over on North Street…”

The younger man cracked and smile and broke in, “You know what she’s doing don’t you?”

The men shook their heads. He continued, “Smith farm. Miller’s stables. Kelly Orchard. The church. Those are all on the outskirts of town but slowly getting closer to her. She’s circling the town. She’s circling us,”

The oldest man waved his hand in disgust but said nothing. They took up their preferred spots for staring; each with a freight train of thoughts, fears and sickening possibilities running through their mind.

“The church could be a coincidence…” One of the men sitting started but was cut off by the youngest one.

“Statutes like that don’t shatter into pieces. Animals don’t get pinned to the door outside like that. Hell, the old graveyard looked like a excavator tore threw there. No, it is connected.”

The calm fire and rustic library acted like armor for the men. A shield. A sanctuary. The study had always been a safe set of walls to discuss these matters. Even the smell of older books, pages and the fire seemed to be an unbreakable wall of protection.

One of the men sitting started to murmur, “At least she can’t get us here,” when the lights in the room flicked on and off four times before remaining on. The older men darted their eyes around. One of the men gripped the chair with white knuckles. The youngest man glanced out the window when a face appeared. He jerked back suddenly and looked away.

“She’s getting closer.” They stared at him and then the window. Silent. A more primal fear took hold of the study. The safety of the books and fireplace felt a little less comfortable. The men felt a little less sure.

“This is what she wants; for us to be afraid. Doubt. It’s not just that she puts bad thoughts in our minds. It’s that she stops good ones, too. Stops hope and belief and confidence. You’ve always been too close to her. I told you to not mess with that thing.” The oldest man directed his comments at the youngest of them near the window.

A knock at the door stopped them and one of their wives came in. After some small talk, the door shut and the men resumed with the younger man firing back, “It was a choice we all made. Four of us. I couldn’t help that I was connected to her. How could I have known? How could any of us?”

The younger one strolled to the whiskey bar as one of the seated men spoke, “We at least did what the fellow said. The guy from New Orleans. He got a way about him and seems to have seen some things. I think we’re safe here, regardless of what happens tonight.” The words were confident but felt hollow.

The other seated man spoke, “Why don’t we call him and see what else we can do? I’d feel better if he was here.”

The youngest and oldest man exchanged nervous glances to each other. The oldest man spoke first in between sips and crackles of the fire as he added two logs, “That isn’t possible.”

The men looked at him as the old man continued, “He’s dead. They found him this morning. Well, what was left of him.”

They all shared blank stares and said nothing. What was left to say. They had made a deal a long time ago. But they broke it decades ago. Fate had caught up with them. Or simply, their choices.

The power went out again. This time for good. Three of the men looked around nervously. The youngest shook his head and continued to gaze out the window, “Has anyone ever talked about it outside the four of us? Maybe after too many drinks? Have you told Beth? Sharon? Whomever you are with aside from Christy?” He looked at each of the men as he said their wives’ names.

The fireplace, the only light in the room now, darkened his comments and face as he spoke. The room would look cozy and comfortable any other night. A loud and illuminating fire, whiskey and a crisp Halloween evening outside. Walls of books. Four old friends deep in conversation.

Another knock a few of the wives came in; some talk about putting candles out and how exciting it felt on Halloween with no power. They said everyone was in good spirits and handed the men some candles and flashlights.

All four men sat in anticipation of what was coming. A broken covenant. Threats ignored. They’d sat high and mighty for decades. Now she was coming. And who knew how many she would take with her. Who knew how many she would take because of them.

The youngest man smirked again. The whiskey and mood settling in on him. Like a warm blanket of confidence and the acceptance of an awful weight bearing down.

“We’re the horsemen, aren’t we? The four horsemen of the apocalypse. And the horses from Miller all messed up. They couldn’t find four of them, right? She’s messing with us. With our heads. Making us see awful things.” His demeanor had begun to alarm the men.

“Why are you so smug and glee?” He interrogated to the youngest man. His position by the fireplace and the soft light of the candles gave him a ghoulish glow. Half his face bathed in warm fire light; the rest of his form darker against the candles. “You’re smirking while we sit on death’s door step.”

The youngest man looked at the oldest, “That’s ironic coming from you. It was you that brought her back. Called her. Why don’t you tell the others? Tell them why she’s here.” The other men sitting looked bewildered at the older man.

“What are you talking about?”

The youngest man pressed, “About three months ago. Bridget Bishop. One of your late night work trips to her apartment. Christy things you’re networking with business leaders. Instead, you’re networking with Bridget. Alone. But a phrase slips out. A word. Then a story. Bridget doesn’t understand so she laughs. You both laugh. Hell, you probably thought about doing it a time or two in here with one of your other ‘friends.’”

The men stare back and forth between those standing. Like a tennis match. The words and reactions being served back and forth in a mixture of disbelief, resentment and fear. The oldest man dawns a look of curiosity and suspicion come over him as the youngest man continues his oratory rant. The faint candle light bounces of his face and demeanor. The window framing his figure in a brooding and malevolent outline.

“Bridget’s had a bit to drink. But you know what you’re saying. You feel safe saying it to her. Connected. Your night together goes on and so does the morning and you feel relief. Relief to get it out off your chest. Relief to share it. But you said the one thing you shouldn’t have. Her. Her name. And for whatever reason, it gave her enough power or intent to come back here.”

A heavy wind shook the window and home as he finished. A perfect creepy bookend to man’s startling diatribe. Details no one could no. Things no one could. The older man felt naked. Embarrassed. His thoughts were known. His intent. Things no human could understand because they had only been said in the safety of his mind.

“How could you know any of that?”

“She told me. In a dream but she told. Showed me actually. It didn’t make sense at first. I was going to call you and tell you about the strangest dream I had. But Christy asked me how your networking trip was. I knew you were here. Then I ran into Mrs. Claire at the coffee shop later that day. She’s going on and on about poor Bridget. And we all know what happened there. And we all know Bridget didn’t jump. She made her do it. We all knew that, even if we didn’t realize it at the time.”

“You felt safe and vulnerable with in your affair. Or maybe you were desperate to connect to something other than your own ambition and power. But you said the one thing we can’t. Bridget was the start. Now, it probably will end with us. Tonight. Your command center you have here where you’ve built privacy to hid the things you want to keep secret from Christy. It’s now a waiting room for us. A platter. For her.”

“Your connection with her is what’s the problem. You have always been drawn to her. Too close. And why didn’t you tell us then?”

“What was there to say? I don’t tell any of you for your protection. Safety. She’s never left my thoughts. There is always a faint whisper. A word. Something. It’s not my fault she singled me out. I’ve made peace with her thoughts in my head. Her influence always pulling at me. None of you have to bear that burden.”

The younger man took a big sip and tore a look out the window again. A thick fog rolled closer. Like a blanket. Or the noose of a rope.

“Do we think that guy from New Orleans did enough to help? Whatever the hell he did?”

“It’s why we brought everyone here and pretended to have a party. It’s why we followed the directions he gave us. It is all we can do. Jesus, we should have made our last stand in a church.” The older man brooded and took a drink.

The study’s demeanor continued to change. From comfortable to anxious and edgy. The younger man coughed a little but stared away from everyone out the window. The oldest man saw the fog was close. He could spy families trick-or-treating among the softly light street below and occasionally hear a knock downstairs amongst the noise of the party.

“What happened to the guy from New Orleans?”

“Sheriff said he thought he got attacked by animal. Bear. Mountain Lion. Like I said, they couldn’t tell much from what was left of him.”

One of the sitting men spoke in soft, more timid voice than before, “Why would she do this? Why wouldn’t she come after us?”

“Maybe it’s all the times we broke the deal. Broke our promise. Broke our oath. She promised us everything if we had just followed through.” The youngest man continued.

“But we didn’t. We thought we knew better. We thought we were smarter, stronger, better, more clever. We should have finished the deal. But we tore it up and laughed in her face. Maybe she’s tearing up things, and people, too.”

“Maybe she’s tearing up some people we know. We care about. Or just anything that happens to slow her down.”

They all jumped at a heavy knock on the door.

The knock at the study door took the men’s attention away from the younger man. One of the wives said a visitor had come by for the men. An old friend. Who, the oldest man asked?

“Mallory Valais.”

The oldest man nodded with a sickening look on his face as the door shut. The two men sitting stared at the oldest man with white faces. Sick-looking. Disgusted. One of them gulped before they heard a sneer from the window. A growl. The three men turned to see their friend, the youngest of the old men, standing. His head looking down but eyes staring intently at them. A strange animal sound came from his lips and mouth accompanied by a sickening grin. An impossibly large grin. Too big for his face.

He looked like their friend. But a sudden bolt of lightning shown and his form flashed for a few seconds. Flashed into her form. Mallory. They beamed at the three men.

A sickening, deep and guttural voice spoke from their friend, “Hello from the darkness my friends.”

The three men screamed as the backed toward the door. But there was no escape. The study had been built to reduce sound. In fact, barely any sound could be heard from anywhere else in the large home.

The oldest man had used the study to work. But also built it to be quiet for his other activities with women on the side. His private room. His area.

Now, his sanctuary was their tomb. No one downstairs heard the screaming. Or yells. Or inaudible moans. They breaking of shelves nor groans of dying men fell silent beyond the study walls.

The walls, built for terrible and sinful things, kept more terrible and sinful things in. The party was too loud, the Halloween music too noisy, and trick-or-treaters were yelling for candy at the front door and everyone felt safe and cozy and comfortable that Halloween. Everyone except for the men in the study. The men who went back on the deal. The men who tricked to trick her. ",2,1761929922.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

It's used 95% of the time for watching TV.

We just purchased a new couch off of marketplace, and now I'd like to be on the lookout for a new chairs and tables but need help sorting out what I'm looking for. I know the couch is not ""pretty"", we went for comfort and practicality over style.

A few notes:  
The bookshelves  have to stay

I know the scratching post is ugly, but I have 3 cats so it's needed

  
I would like to add a coffee table, ideally with storage as our current sectional has storage that we are losing  
I cross stitch so the chair area is currently cluttered, but I can move that to the corner space and sit on the new couch instead.



I'm considering a couple of options:

1. a large barrel chair / chair and a half to replace my current chair, or,
2. 2 chairs in that space instead, which would be nice if we have company over to be able to arrange them in a more conversational seating arrangement.  Should be comfortable enough to watch a movie on but wouldn't be frequently sat in.

Thoughts or ideas on tables and chairs to add to the space?  I'm also going to change out the curtains / curtain rod (it's currently in need of repair), and probably a new rug that is washable.",2,1761929767.0,HomeDecorating,0,1.0,False

I've only tried a few protein/ meal replacements powders and loathed them, mainly the Slim Fast powders and ISO Dunkin Iced Coffee flavor. I really want to try the Ghost and maybe Quest protein powders but not sure what everyone's experiences have been. I thought about getting sample packs, but by the time all is said and done I might as well get a tub for the price. Okay so premix drink wise, I like all the Atkins protein shakes (except the strawberry, dark chocolate, and root beer); Quest vanilla protein shakes and salted caramel; ALL Spylt Milk flavors (these are the GOAT, they have caffeine and flavor, but are like 35 bucks on Amazon with subscribe and save for a case of 12, well worth it but I need to budget better). I am mainly looking for a good vanilla and/or chocolate flavor, but I'm open to dessert flavors for overnight oats (I've seen marshmallow, cookies, and cinnamon bun flavors that sound good in theory). The requirements are that they taste good on their own mixed with liquid (should translate well to overnight oats if so), under $60 bucks for a tub, and lower in sugar or are sugar free, and are under 200 kcal per serving (I'm not trying to make a calorie bomb of overnight oats unless it's a straight meal replacement).

Thankfully in my driveway, so that I could wait for Hyundai roadside assistance in a warm house with a cup of coffee.

At the dealership, I overheard the mechanic who diagnosed my car say to the shop foreman that this one was weird: It *(my car)* didn't have had the recalls done to the ICCU, as opposed to another ioniq 5 in the shop with a dead ICCU. Foreman then replied if he could change the fuse, apply the recall and call it a day (???), of which the mechanic declined because it blew the fuse for a reason.

Anyways, they ordered a new ICCU which arrived the day after. They started replacing it Tuesday afternoon.  Wednesday morning I could pick up my car from the dealership. While a dead ICCU is by no means at all acceptable for a brand new car, it was overall a much faster process than I anticipated.

My aim with this post is to serve as both a PSA and a question...

PSA: Make sure that all recalls are applied during prep of the car before purchasing.

I received good comments, and the rest were like kenchi, ustara etc.

So, we are both girls. We met during our PG. I kind of liked her from the start. Eventually, we both became besties. We shared a lot of fond memories, thanks to her. She's the kindest soul. She always keeps a smile on her face.
Now, after our PG, we are doing our PhDs together, so we are living together in a rented place. Although our labs are different, our institute is the same. 

So, what happened was that two days ago it was raining, so we didn't go to the department. We both decided to stay home, watch a movie, and cook something nice. We started the movie, and after a while, I started feeling sleepy, so I asked her to turn the movie off. Then, after that, everything happened. We explored each other's bodies.

So, I was feeling awkward afterwards. She wasn't talking either, and we were both pretending to be busy. So, I posted here. Some people suggested that I should talk to her.


I gathered the courage and talked to her. She was like, I was about to talk to you. I asked her, Nothing wrong, right? She said no. After that, she hugged me (I cried a lil). I made coffee for her. We both drank it together. But she said I should have asked her before posting on Reddit. I apologized, and she said, It's okay, this much is fine. She's so cool 🥺

Now, we are going out to eat on Sunday. She will pay (I'm broke right now. I haven't received my fellowship 🥲)

1okzqs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1okzqs5/oneonly_palmilla_review/,One&Only Palmilla - Review,"**A Little History**

For those interested in these things, One&Only Palmilla has a genuinely fascinating backstory, and it's really the story of luxury tourism in Los Cabos itself.

Los Cabos as a tourist destination is surprisingly young. In 1951, when the first guesthouse opened in San José del Cabo, the town had a population of just a few thousand, while Cabo San Lucas had only 300 residents. Tourism was exceedingly modest and small-scale. Most early hotels had no more than two dozen rooms, and getting to Southern Baja required flying in supplies, equipment, and even manpower from the Mexican mainland. It wasn't until the Transpeninsular Highway was completed in 1973 and Los Cabos International Airport opened in 1977 that the region became accessible for large-scale tourism. Even then, the airport couldn't handle wide-body jets until a major expansion in 1992.

The property now known as One&Only Palmilla was one of the pioneers that started it all. Originally built in 1956 by Abelardo ""Rod"" Rodríguez Jr., the son of a former Mexican president, and his wife Lucille Bremer, a former actress who had shared screen time with Fred Astaire, it was called Hotel Las Cruces Palmilla. It opened on a beach where cattle were still being loaded onto offshore ships. The hotel had just 15 rooms.

When Conrad Hilton visited as a guest, he reportedly quipped to local hotel pioneer Luis Cóppola: ""For Christ's sake, that's a boarding house, not a hotel!"" But despite its modest size, Palmilla attracted a celebrity-rich clientele from the start: Hollywood royalty, heads of state, and those who valued discretion above all else. In its early years, it was accessible only by boat or small plane. There were no roads, no major airport. It was a true escape.

The resort changed hands over the decades. An American developer eventually bought the property and brought Jack Nicklaus to Los Cabos to design two signature golf courses, including Palmilla. When One&Only took over management in 2004, they expanded the room inventory, added a 25,000-square-foot spa, and brought the first celebrity chef (Charlie Trotter, RIP) to Los Cabos.

What makes Palmilla historically significant isn't just its Hollywood past, it's that it was one of the first luxury resorts in all of Baja California, opening decades before the major hospitality brands arrived. Long before Las Ventanas opened in the 1990s and properties like Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton arrived in the 2000s and beyond, Palmilla set the tone for what Los Cabos could be: a private sanctuary for those seeking natural beauty and world-class hospitality in a place that felt genuinely remote.

This isn't a resort that's trying to be all things to all people. Instead it embraces its position as a private, deeply rooted sanctuary that prioritizes warmth, privacy, and genuine hospitality over flash. And that identity, rooted in its history as Los Cabos' original luxury hideaway, remains intact today.

[Wonderful little secret gardens are all around the property ](https://preview.redd.it/mm9yjznz4hyf1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f64bcbe7597bada303ee17fb34163e571f41a3a)

**First Impressions**

The arrival experience set the tone. As we pulled up, a local shaman greeted us with copal smoke, a traditional Mayan blessing meant to cleanse and welcome. It's the kind of gesture that could feel woo-woo, but it didn't. It felt intentional and grounding, like the property was saying: you're not just checking into a hotel, you're entering a space that respects this place and its traditions.

The architecture is traditional hacienda style: whitewashed walls, terracotta tiles, hand-painted Talavera details, and lush, overgrown landscaping that gives the whole property a jungle-like privacy. There are 174 keys total, including two four-bedroom villas, and the scale never feels overwhelming.

Is everything brand new and cutting-edge? No. The aesthetic is more timeless than trendy, and some finishes show their age. But everything is immaculately maintained. If you need the latest in contemporary design, this probably isn't your place. If you want charm, character, and a sense of history, you'll love it here. I know some of you fellow redditors do not have high opinions of my photography and I will admit - the photos here don't do this resort justice - it's definitely the kind of place you have to experience yourself to see why it's magical.

**Service: The Real Star**

The service here is some of the best I've experienced anywhere.

There are over 1,000 staff members for 174 rooms. You feel it immediately. Every staff member we passed greeted us with their hand over their heart which is a small gesture that, over the course of a week, became deeply moving. It wasn't performative. It felt like genuine care, and my kids noticed it too.

We were assigned a butler, and I'll admit I was skeptical. I've had ""butlers"" at other resorts who you never see again after check-in. Not here. Our butler checked in daily, helped coordinate our dining plans every evening, and brought my kids coloring books after realizing I was traveling alone with 3 kids I needed a little extra distraction for my feral animals at dinner time. When we had an unexpected power outage (more on that in a moment), he helped us pack up our entire room, kept my kids entertained during the move, and made what could have been a stressful situation feel completely manageable.

That level of attentiveness extended to every interaction. At breakfast, staff remembered my kids' egg orders. At dinner, they went out of their way to accommodate my extremely picky eater with custom off-menu dishes that she would actually eat. They quickly figured out my deep love of churros.

[My son wants me to tell everyone they have a garden full of hammocks hidden here too](https://preview.redd.it/xyd3b6z67hyf1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d0a1afc3c9948808aea99c34c1a3049a27e89f0)

**The Power Outage (And How They Handled It)**

Midway through our stay, we had an electrical outage in our building. I expressed some concern to my butler about what I was going to do if we had no power at bedtime- within minutes, our butler was at the door with a plan. They proactively moved us to a building with full power, helped  pack up, manage my feral 4 year old son who didn't have a shirt or shoes on for the entire interaction, and transport everything, and had our new room completely set up before we even arrived. By the time we got there, the kids' stuffed animals were arranged on the beds, the bags were unpacked, and everything felt seamless.

The power in our original room came back on a few hours later, but I was grateful they didn't wait to see if it would. They anticipated the problem and solved it before it became one. That's the kind of service that makes you a repeat guest.

**Rooms**

We stayed in two different room categories: a Casita Junior Suite, oceanfront and an Oceanfront double queen.  The rooms were both spacious, traditionally decorated, and had traditional hacienda-style warmth: wooden beams, tile floors, and doors that opened directly onto a private terrace; there are no bad views here.

The rooms themselves had the essentials - blackout curtains, excellent air conditioning, and really comfortable beds. The bathroom was large, well-lit, and stocked with high-quality products. Everything worked. Everything was clean. 

Housekeeping was flawless. Turndown service included thoughtful touches like arranging the kids' toys and leaving small treats. Everything felt intentional and personal.

[Characterful bathrooms - my children were sad they looked out on the ocean so they couldn't moon anyone](https://preview.redd.it/aokp8b9m5hyf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=980de85d4ab0ac5c3510ef32acf0b8ded137acfd)

[I told you guys these rooms are not the epitome of contemporary glam - so Reddit haters don't @ me.

Zero dust anywhere.](https://preview.redd.it/3hduvc9m5hyf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c929f8a0bc770d9aa8a63b04fb1b98aae16af270)

**The Beach**

This is where Palmilla truly stands out. The beach is one of the few genuinely swimmable beaches along the Cabo Corridor. The water is calm, clear, and protected — perfect for families with young children. My kids spent hours playing in the gentle waves, and I actually felt relaxed watching them rather than constantly worried about undertow.

The beach was never crowded. There are plenty of comfortable loungers, and attentive staff.

For water activities, the resort offers complimentary kayaking, paddleboarding, and snorkeling equipment. 

[we had the beach to ourselves most days](https://preview.redd.it/3osafpph5hyf1.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ee34095a52723c12f7d1c0a263bdf2d4a44980e)

**Kids' Club**

The kids' club was legitimately excellent. My children are at the age where they can be brutally honest about whether they're having fun (usually they fight me on going and are happy to leave), and they loved it. The activities were varied, thoughtful, and well-supervised. The staff was warm and engaging, and my kids asked to go back every single day.

The club is currently in a temporary space while they build a new, expanded location that will double the size. It's scheduled to be finished before Thanksgiving, which is great timing for families planning winter trips.

What impressed me most was how the staff remembered details about each child, their interests, their preferences, what they'd enjoyed the day before. Parents are not supposed to hang out but I lingered a little bit in the hallway and heard them dealing with my son who was being kind of an a-hole about some perceived slight in a jump rope game, and I was really impressed with how quickly they got him to turn it around (he still legitimately sucks at jumprope, however - they're not miracle workers after all). It felt personal and genuinely caring, not just babysitting.

**Food**

We ate at several of the resort's restaurants, and the quality was consistently excellent. My favorite was Seared, the steakhouse. The food was outstanding, and the service was just awesome. They went above and beyond to accommodate my picky eater, creating custom dishes that weren't on the menu and presenting them beautifully. My one mild critique is that the food here is expensive. If you are going expecting cheap tacos, this is not your jam.

Every morning, we stopped by La Casa de Abuela, a charming little spot that serves coffee in the morning and refreshments in the afternoon. My kids went ham on the juices. The mexican coffee was top notch.

For breakfast the buffet is presented beautifully and my kids loved the magical pastry cabinet.

[Magic](https://preview.redd.it/b25b89wa6hyf1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9e22d9e6bf633069023e72a836871ffc5a47863)

**Spa & Wellness**

The One&Only Spa is exceptional. It has 13 treatment rooms, all designed to accommodate couples, and the atmosphere is serene and deeply spiritual. The highlight for me was the temazcal (sweat lodge), which is guided by a shaman. The temazcal is a traditional Mayan purification ceremony, and the experience is meant to represent the womb: you enter in darkness, sit in intense heat, and emerge feeling reborn. It's not for everyone, but if you're open to it, it's powerful.

The entire spa feels less like a hotel amenity and more like a true wellness sanctuary. Everything about it, from the design to the treatments to the rituals, is rooted in the culture and Mexican traditions.

The gym was well-equipped and had natural light, which I appreciated. It's not massive, but it has everything you need for a solid workout.

**Other Amenities**

The resort has a 27-hole golf course (18 holes private, 9 public), two tennis courts, two pickleball courts, and a new arcade that opens after 11 a.m. There's also a new social club, and the resort continues to add thoughtful amenities without losing its intimate feel.

The landscaping is lush, private, and gives the property a true jungle-meets-ocean vibe. You feel completely removed from the rest of Cabo, which is exactly the point.

There's also a chapel on the property, built in 1957, which is still used for weddings and private services. It's a beautiful piece of the resort's history and adds to the sense of place.

[Really dreamy kid pool - also they have kid sized loungers that are truly the cutest and my kids loved them](https://preview.redd.it/v6kvjsvi6hyf1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=282fa17c754abd1ead4b40eb6558fc2eec413919)

**Final Takeaways**

One&Only Palmilla is not the flashiest or the newest. Instead it distinguishes itself through thoughtful, rooted, and genuinely excellent hospitality. 

The service is some of the best I've experienced. The property is private, beautiful, and immaculately maintained. The food is excellent, the kids' club is top-tier, and the whole place feels like it genuinely cares about your experience.

I met and saw several ultra-high-net-worth guests during our stay, and it was clear why they chose Palmilla: discretion, privacy, and service that anticipates rather than reacts.

This is a place that earns its reputation every single day.

Families who want genuinely excellent kids' programming and attentive service

1okzq0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1okzq0n/the_kindness_of_strangers/,The kindness of strangers,"I went to breakfast today, to a place I've been often.  They know me there, although I don't go super frequently.  I like to sit at the counter and read a book while I eat breakfast.  There was another regular at the counter this morning, a guy who goes there most days just for coffee.  I don't really know him, but I see him there most of the time.  He was trying to get Cesar (the server) to give him change for a 20 dollar bill in order to pay for his coffee, but Cesar wouldn't give it to him because he wasn't charging the guy for his coffee.

Anyway, a lady walked in, kind of an older lady.  She had a loud voice.  She wasn't being noisy; she seemed very nice and cheerful.  She just had a loud voice.  Cesar seated her at a table behind me and brought her a water, and she wanted to know how much a single small pancake would cost.  When he told her it would be $6 and change, she said, ""Good!  I have enough for that.""  Later, I could hear the clink of coins from behind me as she must have been counting out money.

In the meantime, the other guy at the counter left, having a quick conversation with Cesar on the way out.  When Cesar brought me my food, I asked him, kind of sotto voce, ""Hey, can you put that lady's food on my tab?""  I'm not rich, but I figure $6 means more to her than it does to me.  I hate the thought that money's so tight you don't even know if you can get something to eat.

Cesar told me, ""No, man, that other guy already paid for her before he left.""  When he brought her her pancake, he told her it was already paid for, and she protested.  She wanted to pay for it.  When he insisted that it was already paid, she still wanted to leave him a tip, which he also declined.  You could tell she was a little embarrassed, maybe, or proud, but Cesar was very diplomatic and made her feel at ease accepting it.  She got her breakfast, and she still had that little money for something else later on.

In a world where I see too much selfishness, hatred, bigotry, and casual dismissal of others, I'm just glad there are people who are genuinely looking out for one another.  It gives me hope.  It's a rough old world, and it's good to know there are strong and kind souls out there for us to lean on sometimes.  Good work, fellas.",2,1761929239.0,offmychest,0,0.76,False

**Genre: Psychological Horror**

**Estimated year of release: between 2015-2023 maybe?**

**Graphics/art style: Low-Poly PS1 Style, rather colorful, definitely not bright**

**Notable characters: Player Character, NPC near a sidewalk**

**Notable gameplay mechanics: Walking, talking, using things**

**Other details:** Hi everyone, I'm trying to find a PC indie game I saw a video about (probably around 2022-2023) but I can't remember the name or the channel. The game had a very distinct low-poly, PS1-style aesthetic, and a surreal/experimental narrative. Here’s what I remember:

* The player is dropped off in front of a research facility (either by car or taxi).
* You sign a contract or NDA at the entrance.
* There’s a coffee machine near the door with a “special coffee” the game strongly encourages you to drink.
* If you **take the coffee**, you enter a room, and almost instantly (like within a fraction of a second in the game) you exit the facility a short time later (maybe 15-30 minutes in-game). You then meet a man sitting by the beach who talks about the people who participated in the research. This is one ending.
* If you **refuse the coffee**, you go to a designated room with a strange machine or “bed” that accelerates your perception of time. Inside, you see what looks like an infinite space filled with cubicles, each with a person answering questions on a computer. The computer holds something like **1 trillion yes/no questions**, and the player is trapped until all are answered. The coffee apparently neutralizes the time-perception effect. This is the second ending.
* The game explains the research as some kind of experiment with this time-perception technology.
* The vibe reminds me of “Tartarus Engine” by Mike Klubnika, but it’s definitely not that game.

I hope this is enough detail. I remember the game having a very unsettling but fascinating atmosphere, and the story stuck with me.

I've been trying to look for similar posts but I don't think I'm finding a very clear cut answer here. I'm hoping ya'll can help me. 

  
My goal: Let's say I'm running a campaign for a coffee shop. I would like to drive users to the physical location through actions related to the Google Business Profile (Get Directions clicks, call clicks, maybe online order clicks). Essentially I want the Google Maps Ad to appear in either the SERP on Google or in Google Maps. 

  
I'm having trouble figuring out how best to do that, I got guidance that PMAX was that way. I've got a PMAX campaign set up with a location extension but I'm finding that it's showing across multiple channels (Discover being the largest bucket)

  
I thought about trying to lump all of the conversion actions with ""Business Profile"" in the name into 1 conversion goal but they're not editable. Same thing with the conversion actions with ""local actions"" in the name, not editable. 

  
Does anyone have any guidance on how best to try to achieve this? I can settle for a PMAX campaign that optimizes for both web and Google Profile actions (thought I'd want to set values to get priorities).

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1761928688.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

For many hardworking contractors, the real horror story isn’t ghosts or goblins — it’s messy books, vanished profits, and tax-season chaos.

But here’s the truth:  
You don’t need to fear your finances. When you start tracking your job costs, staying on top of cash flow, and working with pros who understand the trades — you turn financial *fright* into financial *freedom.* 💪

This season, don’t let your books haunt you.  
Face your numbers with confidence and watch your business come alive again. ⚡

But then you realize you’ve got the same sense of humor, the same outlook on family, even the same sports team loyalty. You start grabbing a coffee after a meeting or catching up just to talk about life ,not the case.

I’ve had this happen more than once. In one case, a client referred by a colleague became a real friend. We both came from pretty dysfunctional families, had kids around the same age, and looked at the world in similar ways. When his case ended, the friendship didn’t and when I later found out he’d had a serious heart attack in another state, I drove 3 1/2 half hours to visit him in rehab.

That’s when it hit me how rare and meaningful those connections can be. Some clients just become part of your life not because of the fee, but because something real clicked.

I grabbed the nearest thing I had, a busted silver candlestick from last year’s decorations, and stepped outside. Big mistake.

The wolves came for me, but they didn’t stand a chance. I moved faster than I ever had, faster than I thought was possible. Claws and fangs, blood and moonlight. It was over in seconds.

I'm pretty picky with my matcha since I lived in Asia for most of my life. Most matcha I've had in the States just taste like cereal milk. But the matcha I like retains the richness and some bitterness of the matcha, with the sweetness only enhancing the flavor.

I should add a caveat that I've been meaning to try Kaizen's matcha, and I'm sure they do a great job since their coffee is amazing. It's just that whenever I want my matcha fix I stick with my go-to since I know it won't disappoint.

After I graduated, it seems that I got neither. They always told me that not everyone starts out with their dream job, and I finally understood that when I worked at my local grocery store for shit pay. I wasn’t ready to accept it then, even after 500 emails saying I didn’t fit the “matched” jobs, but I guess life had other options for me. The best I could ever do was land this one. Four years of earning my degree only to use my university level training in scanning products, weighting products, and dealing with customers. 

Things back home weren’t so good either. My parents got themselves into major financial debt just so that I could complete college. My dad was doing double shifts while my mom had to do three just to break even with the mortgage payments on top of it too. With me in that terrible job, it was the best I could do to contribute to them.

It wasn’t too bad though since I made a friend at the grocery store, his name was Victor. Loves Jesus as much as he loves horror movies. More than that, though, he was a beacon of hope to live on instead of just giving up. I even remembered speaking to my friend Victor about the latest movie we’d seen. It felt good to engage with him. It felt like a cushion to cope with the pandemonium of my post-college reality. Moreso by someone that understood me. The only warmth I felt in this dreary job was sharing a shift with him.

It was the day she showed up.

“So do you think that she got murdered in that shot?” he asked as he leaned over the checkout counter cross from me. From my perspective it felt like I was in a horror movie. The grocery store had a sickly yellowish white on the floors and everything else with build up of mildew seeping out of corners. The fluorescent lights buzzed and hummed as if they were a swarm of mosquitos. Yeah, I entertained the chances of this being my last shift.

“No way,” I replied. “I think it’s meant to leave people thinking.”

“Yeah that was what my girlfriend thought when we saw it.” He said as he scratched his chin hair. *My girlfriend*. My mind echoed those words. “So are you gonna go to that party I said about?”

“Oh yeah, that party. I’d be down!” I replied as I thought the idea of a fun, brief, nostalgic return to college life was helpful. I needed that return to something that made sense. Definitely better than being here for minimum wage. I didn’t notice that he was about to head out for the day.

When he clocked out and said his goodbye, my mind fell, again, into that familiar destitution. It was as if I was sinking deeper into an ocean of despair reaching conclusions like how I won’t be spending the rest of my life with someone *other* than my family. *My Girlfriend*. I had the notion that by sharing my life with someone I love and trust, things would be easier. I was naive to believe that, but I did back then. The congregation in my mind got into such heated feats of debate that I grew numb on the world around me. Eventually descending into despair. *How will this amount help my parents? Why can’t I just land a job that pays more? Why did Victor have to leave? Why am I so alone?* I wasn’t sure how long I was sinking like this. Minutes felt like hours here.

The remaining 30 minutes felt like I was in constant sleep paralysis. My eyes glazed and soggy as I got lost into the nihilistic nothingness that my mind could produce. All the while I heard the sounds of chattering customers whose breath smelled like what they ate, coworkers that were vexing imps, and a carousel of pop music that played over and over again. I heard the same 10 songs since the afternoon alongside the comforting smell of the store’s aroma of rotted vegetables and vinegar. David Bowie was singing for the 17th time before getting cut to another popular song reaching its own 17th.

While this was the most torturous amount of time spent that I’ll never recall the next day, it wasn't not all that bad. At this hour, the store would be barren of all the usual customers that you’d see. So, when a customer does show up, they'd tend to be the weirdest ones, and it was the most memorable part working late hours here for better or for worse. I felt the tapping of footsteps approaching my counter with their items of choice. I was about to open my mouth when the words got caught in my throat as the world disappeared when I saw … *her*.

I was not really that big into goth girls. I've only ever seen them online, so when I saw her, it really caught me off guard. She was a tall gothic princess; dominated in high heeled boots with silver strappings, making her about 6 ft tall. It led up to her long bluish-black dress that was only separated by both her snow white thighs and purple belt shaping her figure. Following up, her neck wore both a black choker and a silvery necklace that had a silver ankh attached to it. She also had some of those ankhs on her ear piercings, and it was only when I noticed her lip piercing did I get a good look at her face.

Her face was heart shaped with ivory soft skin, rosy cheeks, and maroon red lips which gave her look doll-like and innocent. She had her jet black hair tidied up to two high pigtails broken by strands of lavender to match her smell. Finally, I looked deep into her pale blue eyes that reminded me of the ocean. An endless sea crashing against the sand on a cloudy gray mourn. So hypnotic to just forget about all the dumb problems that anyone had to deal with in the cruel things life had to offer. A feeling so true to anyone in a grocery store uniform and apron.

I snapped back into reality as I was rushing to scan all of her items as she was just looking at me curiously. She didn’t say anything at all, just looked at me. It was kinda freaky, and it made me more nervous than I should. I never got that kind of attention at all. Especially from someone this beautiful.

“S-Shit, s-sorry ma’am. U-uuh, how was your night? Did anything interesting happen?” I asked as I was shoving an eggplant into a bag. Usually, I’d wait for other items that match its type for neatness. She didn’t respond. She had a solemn expression which made her lips look pouty and plump. Her eyes, however, showed the most activity. She kept looking at the groceries and mostly at me. Those pale blue eyes moved precisely like crashing waves; was she analyzing me? What was she trying to find in me?

It was hard not to look, but I had to focus on my job even as I felt the heat on my face and her stare when typing up the total. The store was spinning all around me, and I kept miscalculating the total and the cash she was giving me. I cursed when I dropped a dollar as I went to pick it up, I hastily opened the till and gave her her change as I met her pale beauty again.

I wanted to say something. Anything to make her say something. But I didn’t. I felt frozen there with the change in my hand as she took it, nodded and left. My eyes followed her until she was gone. I was allowed to breathe again as my heart was racing miles and my mind was running marathons with thoughts. *Who was she? I didn’t get time to get to know her. Is she single? Obviously she was not, since she looks gorgeous! BRO JUST LEAVE HER ALONE, she just wanted groceries.* I was able to clock out after 30 minutes, but she was long gone by then. I thought that I wouldn’t see her again. The notion left me wilted and went back to my car morosely. At the very least, I got something to talk about at that house party, I guess.

\*\*\*

Victor and I parked over to the house in some suburban place, and man, was this guy throwing a party. It was like a frat party. There was toilet paper thrown over the house and tree branches as if they were party ribbons and disco colors flashing on hues in cue with the pulsing, booming music that made anyone on a 20 mile radius want to call the police. People on the porch were either leaving because they were done or just puking up their drinks, and entering would walk slowly to record those puking. Me and Victor didn’t do it out of pity.

As if the outdoors wasn’t ravenous enough, it was truly a jungle when we entered inside. People were bouncing to the beat of the music blaring somewhere in this two story house. Guys laughing in friend groups and some trying to hit on some girls there. Some were even doing a drinking game with beer pong. Toilet paper around the ceiling fans and stair railings as it was outside, and a banquet of various chips and drinks. I helped myself with a drink and filled it with some soda - never get punch in parties - and it reminded me a bit about college life seeping in. My sinking mind was sidelined when Victor was shouting at me about something.

“What?” I shouted over the music.

“I said ‘so she just looked at you?” he replied.

“Jeez man, I didn’t know what to say at the moment,” I said as I sipped the last of my drink.

“I mean it’s okay man, people usually mess up at first,” he said as he took a swig. “But if you ever see her, just ask her out for some coffee! I mean who knows, \*hic\* maybe she’ll be here? This house seems big enough to fit the city in, so I guess she’d be here?”

“I don’t know man,” I said pensively, staring deep into the empty cup. I have seen other people say that that’s a good way to start. Maybe I’ll give it a try if I ever get that chance.

“Nah,” he said, putting a hand on my shoulder. “I’m sure she’ll show. Maybe someday, you’ll get to talk to her! Just ask her about a coffee date thing. Ya know? Anyway, \*hic\* I’m gonna find Lucy, she said she got in the house.” I ended up alone again as I looked around the room. As much as I wanted to, I couldn’t get her off my mind since that day.

*Maybe Victor was right. Maybe that goth girl would show up here*. I thought. Scoffing at the idea, I went to get more to drink my problems away. While I was pouring it in, I heard a husky  voice behind me say, “Hey, I’ve seen you before.” I turned around and my heart stopped. Paralyzed and clutching at the table, I looked and was petrified.

*Holy shit*. 

She no longer looked like a princess but she definitely dressed more for party fashion. Same boots but now with the addition of fishnet leggings to match her dark micro short jeans, a crop top, some band called TOOL. on it, and those same piercings on her ear and lip. She had her hair fixed in an updo which made her look a bit regal with loose lavender strands\*.\* She looked at me with those eyes that lit up in all colors from the party lights and the warm glow of the lights gave a magical touch in the air as I got my second chance. Her eyes widened to match mine, maybe a bit too playfully as her black lips formed a smile.

My mind was having a heated debate again, much to my exhaustion. *Yo, you gotta talk to her this time! No, leave her be, might be taken already! But why would she show up to him, again?!* The internal congregation in my mind ceased when I decided that this was my only chance to talk to her. I drank my fears, swallowed, and began to speak. It felt like a century just to say hi. She smiled. It became harder to say anything at that point. The party music was drowning, the walls closing in and my mind struggling to grope for something, anything to say.

“Y-y-yeah, the cashier guy.” I drawled long with a nervous gaping smile. *God, I’m so lame.* She snorted and smiled that deadly smile as she hid her mouth to take a sip of her drink; she filled in the awkward silence that followed.

“So, like, how long have you been working there?” She asked.

“Uhh, about a year now."" I said without realizing the pain. A year of this bullshit.

“Do you … like it there?” She seemed like she didn’t want to insinuate anything, but my face must have given her the answer. “Well, uhh, have you considered doing something else? A side hustle?"" She said as she smiled again. Teeth and all; Her canines were as perfect as she was.

“What are you getting at? I don’t even… ahh crap,” I said before realizing. I gave out my hand to her. “I’m Damian. Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.” I said as she took it. I didn’t expect her hand to be so cold. Maybe it was the AC in the party house.

“Madeline. But you can call me Maddy,” she said as she locked eyes on mine and said, “Damian.” The way she said it gave me a deeply bubbly feeling from my nave to my chest. I felt a bit better. I knew that she was trying to seduce me, but I guess not enough to pull me over.

“So, *Maddy*, what concert have you been to?” I said as suave as I can be. I guess talking about this TOOL band would be the best way to avoid the subject of my crashing career. She got deep into thought, as if to dig deep into her memory.

“Uhh, I have been to, I think, the one in Detroit, Michigan. I don’t remember the type of concert but it was when they weren’t as big as they are now. I haven’t been into concerts as much though.” She said.

“Have you been to Detroit? You moved in?” I said.

“Yeah, I thought I could start a new life here. Too hot over there, you know?.” She said as she fixed a part of her shirt. 

“I’m pretty sure Detroit was just as cold as here” I said.

She looked back at me. “Yeah it was to me at least. So how about you? Have you been to a concert?”

“Oh umm,” I thought hard. I rubbed the back of my neck while thinking about something to say. I didn’t know much about this band at all, but I didn’t want to sound like a wimp either. As I was thinking of something to say, I spotted both Victor and Lucy as they were watching me, Lucy giggling while Victory nodding his head with a grin of approval before waving at me. I turned to Madeline. “Uh Hey, I spotted my friends spying on us, you want to meet them?”

She snorted. “Sure, weirdo.”

I went over to where Victor and Lucy were. I introduced them to Madeline and likewise as we discussed further about metal bands. I shouldn’t be surprised that she was into horror movies to which Victor interrogated her about what her favorite scary movie was. She got us to talk about that movie again. Her take was interesting. She mentioned how the girl's wounds left untreated would cause her to die by exsanguination. I looked puzzled a bit.

“Since when did you take medical school?” Victor asked.

“I just think it's good to know the human body and how to treat it. You know?” Madeline replied. “My family and I work with blood donations and since my parents needed someone that can take up the day shift, I was the perfect choice. Say that reminds me,” She turned over to me. “We’re looking for someone to fill in a vacancy, and I was wondering if you’d like to sign up?”

I looked at her with shock. A job? Right, that side hustle she mentioned earlier. The more she described the role and benefits, the more I wanted to apply. It was definitely better than being just a grocery clerk. I thought of the potential amount of cash flowing in to help my aging parents. How proud they’d be of me that their son got a role that pays better.

“So where can I sign?” Victor added jokingly before I got to ask.

“Oh sorry, it’s only for one,” She said as she looked at me and gave me a business card. “I’d like to meet you at the bus’ location. I think you’d be a great fit for the role.”

I took the card she gave me as we continued talking. My head was in the sky amidst the noise as I held onto her card. This girl and her job offer lifted the gloom of my hometown as I realized that I can have my cake and eat it too. It came to an end as Victor shook me back to earth.

“Hey man come on now. We got work tomorrow, and I got to do something with my dad.” Shit, I forgot about that throughout all of this. So we were on our way out of the party, not nauseous at all, and as we did, Madeline said something that I always wanted to hear, and something that sealed my fate forever.

“Hey so like, do you want my number?”

That was how I met my girlfriend. I wish I never had.",1,1761928234.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1okz9va,https://www.reddit.com/r/barstool/comments/1okz9va/ranking_barstool_employeespersonalities_2_ways/,Ranking Barstool Employees/Personalities (2 ways),"Ok, I know these rankings posts are kind of stupid and I fully acknowledge that I'm a loser for making this post and putting as much thought and detail into it as I have. But let's be real, I work a boring ass 8-5 office job sitting behind my computer all day. I work hard from 8-1 and then try to fill my time in the afternoon until the clock strikes 5 and I can go home. I'm pretty certain that 90% of stoolies can relate, so fucking sue me. Hadn't seen one of these rankings posted in a good 3-4 years (or one that made any waves at least) and felt like doing it. This is Reddit after all - isn't this supposed to be the place to post stupid shit like this?

Two lists:

* **Actual Value/History of the Company** \- Ranking employees based on their actual value to Barstool while also taking into consideration the long history of the stool and giving some credit to the OGs, even if their value isn't necessarily super high at the moment. Their contributions to Barstool lore have some value.
* **My Personal Favorites** \- Who I enjoy following on the day to day most + the content they create. Although they're just my personal favorites, I still take into consideration their value/overall history with the company.

**Actual Value/History of Barstool**

1. **Dave** \- I shouldn't have to elaborate much here. Founder. Needle mover of all needle movers. Love him or hate him, he's obviously #1 on any list without question.
2. **Big Cat** \- Main character/business owner of Barstool's most valuable brand, Pardon My Take. That alone is enough to take the top spot under Dave, but he obviously provides loads of value beyond that. Leader of Chicago Office. Leader/Business owner of The YAK. Stella Blue Coffee. The list goes on and on. He involves himself in as much other Barstool content possible to elevate other people's platforms. Easily the most beloved of the entire Barstool family. Not to mention, he's widely considered the hardest working employee at Barstool as well, even given his prominent stature/tenure. History? There from damn near the beginning - certainly considered an OG even if he wasn't one of the first 3 or 4 employees with Dave. Like Dave, he transcends Barstool on his own. Everyone in media knows Big Cat. And most people love him. Any list that doesn't have Dave & Dan 1/2 is invalid.
3. **Riggs** \- I'm actually laughing out loud as I list him as #3 knowing how hard people are going to come at me for this take hahahah. But humor me/hear me out. This list ranks value above history/lore although that is also taken into consideration. I'm pretty certain the machine Riggs created in Foreplay is the most valuable brand/business Barstool has after PMT - And in my opinion, it's the most impressive one. I'm not 100% it's more valuable than Chiclets, but I would guess it is, and Riggs built it himself from the start and it's still growing so much. Dave also never really cared for Riggs. Constantly referring to him as ""the cross-eyed fuck"" and generally considering him a loser - but that didn't stop Riggs and you rarely see Dave disparaging him nowadays because he's making Prez alottttttt of money. He never let that hold him back and now has an empire (maybe not quite an empire but it's a pretty damn successful business, so I'm going to refer to it as that) on his hands and golf content has never been more popular than it is now and will be going forward. Barstool Classics, top merch sales for the company, part of the ""legit"" media in golf. He and the Foreplay brand also transcend Barstool on their own - in the golf world at least. You won't see Riggs on my list below of personal favorites, but what he has built and the dream life he now lives (that you, me, and so many others are jealous of, let's be honest) because of it is one of the more impressive stories ever at Barstool and can't be understated. OK, I got that off my chest - feel free to come after me and the cross-eyed alcoholic now - I stand firmly by this take.
4. **Whit/Biz** \- Whit is the owner/founder of the next most valuable/profitable brand/business at Barstool in Spittin' Chiclets. While I think that Riggs deserves a spot on this list on his own, I really don't think Chiclets is what it is without Biz. Sure, Foreplay isn't the same without Frankie & Trent, but I would venture to guess that from a purely business perspective he is much more involved and responsible for the growth of that brand than Whit is on his own with Chiclets. That's not a knock on Whit - Some of the people on this list just deserve to be ranked as couples vs. solo and I think Whit/Biz are one of those. Another crazy impressive brand that generates a lot of revenue for the company and is capable of standing alone without Barstool as its own business. With Biz's spot on the nationally televised TNT NHL Panel, he brings even more visibility and notoriety to the Chiclets brand and Barstool as a whole.
5. **Rhea/Fran** \- Chicks in the Office is my guess as to what is next most valuable brand/business at Barstool. While I would guess it might not be quite as profitable as Foreplay or Chiclets, some might argue it's just as valuable because of the audience/demographic it brings to the stool. Tough to get women to follow the Barstool World, but CITO without a doubt has this demo. Want to talk history? Rhea and Fran are sort of OGs - they've been at Barstool for a long time - longer than several others on this list. They've been involved in a lot of all time content over the years, most notably the Rhea and Hank relationship lore stuff. The brand they built makes good money of the company and you really can't tell the history of Barstool without them.
6. **KFC/Feits** \- I struggled with this one because at this current moment in time, I'm not sure how much real value they provide to the company based on the content they produce. However, given their history at Barstool, it really wouldn't feel like a legit list without them on it. Two I would certainly consider as OGs. I'm not sure how the ""part ownership"" stakes shook out once Dave bought back the company from PENN, but at one point, KFC was one of those part owners, which should say enough in itself. Two guys I like but certainly wouldn't appear anywhere near the top 10 on my personal favorites list - I do respect their tenure with the company though and they've been involved in so much over the years that this spot feels right.
7. **Hank/Gaz** \- Another one where the OG status and overall history with the company are significant enough on their own for them to make this list. It's hard to say what their actual value is because they aren't really ""content personalities"" but they both have high ranking management positions within the company which obviously carry some weight and some value to the companies overall success, even if they aren't directly responsible for a particular brand or business. Not to mention Hank's direct involvement with PMT as half content half producer. Barstool guys thru and thru. Countless content stories with both of them involved over all the years even though they aren't really ""content"". If Barstool was the Mafia, these two would both be on the very short list of ""made men"", and for that reason alone, they deserve a spot.
8. **PFT** \- 8 - 11 is where things got a little tricky for me. But in reality, it's really more like 9-11, because even though he's not my favorite, PFT deserves a spot on his own. Dan's counterpart to Barstool most successful brand in PMT - from the start and still going strong. Liked by most everyone, been there a long time, part of a ton of different epic Barstool stories, PFT for sure makes the list I think. He hasn't really had any home runs in any of the content stuff he's done outside of PMT, but he involves himself in a bunch of other brands and content opportunities and is generally good and brings viewership to those things just based on his status as a prominent figure on PMT alone. That's how big the PMT influence is.
9. **Brandon Walker** \- Here's the next one after Riggs where I could potentially see people up in arms over their spot, but hey, we're getting to the last spots in the top 10. Love him or hate him, BFW is really fucking good at his job, man. He could be a sports analyst/podcaster/personality really anywhere in the media. He puts in the work and you can tell he's highly respected among his peers both above and below him in the pecking order. I don't think he's part of management in any way, but it does sort of have the feeling that he is at times. I guess in a way he is since he is the owner/business runner of the Mostly Sports brand. I'm not sure how profitable this brand is, but from what I've gathered, it does make money for the company and is on the up and up. His personality translates really well in all the other content he is a part of. He's a main character of the YAK, The Dozen (two more brands that make money for the company and wouldn't be the same without Brandon), and is always a strong contributor wherever else he appears (Fox Sports program contributor, Barstool CFB show etc.) I would guess that the amount of money Brandon makes would shock people. I don't know what it is, but I think it's probably higher than most would suspect. I think he's pretty valued by Dave & Dan - for this and for all the other reasons I just mentioned, Brandon grabs a spot on this list and impressively has the least tenure/history (I think) of anyone else on the list.
10. **Kirk** \- Fucking Kirk, lol. Look, I don't know how valuable Kirk actually is. I don't know if KMS makes money for the company or not (for the record, most Barstool pods and brands don't), and I really don't know if there's any other content out there that he's directly responsible for, but he certainly brings the views on anything and everything he involves himself in. He does host The Unnamed Show, which I think is profitable, so there's some tangible value there, but obviously that show works because Dave moves the needle. This spot is more earned based on history, legend status, and overall Barstool Lore. Kirk has been involved in countless major content stories over the years. He's a main character in the Barstool cast. He has probably the most rabid following of any Barstool personality. I think he takes the last spot on the list. Funny, I almost gave this spot to Kirk's good buddy Jeff D. Lowe. Man, people would've been pissed about that one lol. I actually think Jeff brings more tangible value to the company, but just the legend that Kirk is and his overall history with the company, I decided to give it to Kirk instead.

**Honorable Mentions**:

* **Jeff D. Lowe** \- I previewed this in the writeup of Kirk, but I think Jeff actually brings some really big time value to the company. I get it... a lot of people hate Jeff D. Lowe - I agree, he's not the most likeable guy in the world, that's for sure. But he's been treated that way by Dave, people of the internet, and even some of his coworkers for a long time, so I do find his success even more impressive. The Dozen IS a profitable brand for Barstool. Another one where Dave at first was on record talking about how stupid it was, but now you don't hear him saying shit. Live Shows, YouTube Viewership, Merch Sales - The Dozen is a really good product. And not an easy product to deliver, at all. A lot of hard work goes into that thing. It also provides a pretty big platform for other Barstool personalities to grow their own brands. He also is the maestro behind Surviving Barstool, which has been very successful for the company as well and is now an annual thing. You might not like Jeff D. but he's a pretty valuable part of Barstool at this point. The hard work he puts in to make those brands work, is wayyy harder to replace than people might think. Damn... maybe I should've given him that 10 spot - I'll let the mental head case buddies fight that one out.
* **Bri** \- Look, if I was making this list 2 years ago, Bri is for sure up there in the top 5. She had her run there with BFFs and her own personal brand/pod. It was clear she was bringing in a lot of money for the company. She's very clearly on the downswing now though - don't blame her - she's been thru some shit and needed to step away for a bit. I'm not sure she's going to be able to bounce back anywhere close to where she was though and I doubt she's bringing that much value to Barstool at this current moment in time.
* **Rone** \- I don't know when exactly Rone started at Barstool, but he sure does feel like somewhat of an OG. Not quite a made man, but he's been here for a minute. He and Caleb had a legendary run there for so long. Such a funny guy. And most people love him, whether it's his peers or the people of the internet. I know he's trying new things, but I'm just not sure how much business value he really brings to the table at the moment. If he were to make the list, it would have been on history and legend status alone. I thought about it for a second.
* **Rico** \- Lol. I'll save most of what I'm going to say about Rico in my personal favorites list below. While Rico brings some decent value to the company as well as history, I don't think either one is enough combined to make the list. Certainly has been a part of a lot of legendary moments over the years though. Worthy of an honorable mention for sure here.
* **Nate** \- I dk man... he's kind of an OG... I felt like I had to give him honorable mention. He had to show up somewhere. He sure as hell isn't showing up on the personal favorites list lol. And I dk what his exact job is now but I mean it's some sort of management role, so I guess there is some value there ha. The dog.

**My Personal Favorites**

1. **Dave** \- Look... we all have a love/hate relationship with Dave. But if you're really a stoolie, deep down, you know you love the guy. He is the pulse. The straw constantly stirring the drink. You're not going to agree with every take he has or every action he takes, and you'll even hate him at times, but you sure as hell are going to be interested and follow along. To love Barstool is to love Dave - And I really don't think that's that crazy of a take.
2. **Big Cat** \- Yes, #1 and #2 of my most valuable rankings as well as personal favorites are the same. Boring? I dk, maybe, but that's just the way it is. These two are the goats and without them, Barstool would be nothing. It's funny, I actually used to not like Dan all that much 6-7 years ago. Wasn't really all that into PMT and found him kind of annoying for whatever reason. Didn't get all the hype and why so many people love him. Over time, he's grown on me a lot. He's a real guy and you can tell he cares a lot about his coworkers and friends. I think it's pretty cool how much he's leaned into family and dad life. All this but he's still just a super relatable, funny ass dude at the end of the day. And one with a big heart. That's why we all love Big Cat.
3. **Rico** \- Fuckin a man... I can't get enough of Bosco lol. And I'm not even a Ryder, honestly. I mean I guess if he's my #1 most liked guy after Dave & Dan, that technically is the definition of a Ryder, but trust me, I'm still blocked by Rico on Instagram ha. I don't know what it is about certain people that just turn into content machines when they get their balls busted, but Barstool has several of them and Rico is the best of them all. I'm a big fan of Pickem - I totally acknowledge the show is way less about actual picks and way more about just funny stuff in the life of Rico and giving him a hard time, but quit lying to yourself - it works. It's funny as hell. It's amazing content. Sure, it can feel a bit too ""schtick-y"" at times, but I don't care, I love it and so many others do. I really don't even think Rico is all that talented or bright to be honest - quite the contrary. He's one of the rare few that is so psycho enough that when he's purely himself, that's good enough. For me, he elevates everything he's apart of - if Rico has a part in it, I'm tuning in. I will say - I think his new venture Bosco Industries has kind of sucked so far. But that's just because Rico is doing it on his own and he's a moron. It'll be a lot funnier once he gets outside of his comfort zone and starts really doing this with real companies and real people instead of just friends of him from back in the day and growing up. It's not real right now. Anyways, sue me, I love Rico - We Ryde.
4. **KB/Nick** \- KB gon' have that 4 spot man. These two are just so genuinely funny and talented. And I think a lot of us secretly love their friendship (no homo) - Just two peas in a pod. It's always the most random shit too - Just this morning I watched a clip of KB go off on a rant about The Rock and how he's just doing way too much. How he needs to just be on a Yacht in the middle of nowhere having a bunch of Brazilian models ""bounce on him"" 24/7 while his wife watches and applauds. Just go look it up. You can't not laugh. Dude is just so weird and so funny. Same for Nick. Nick's humor is different though. It's more calculated - which generally, I think people find less funny, but it's such a level of ""smart"" funny that you 1. find yourself appreciating how bright the guy actually is, and 2. find yourself laughing even harder because you're just so baffled by how the fuck this guy even thought of that lol. And their both good dudes too - that's clear. And I do have an appreciation for that when you get to see it because we so rarely do in the world of Barstool and constant schticks etc. Some of the times I've laughed the hardest at Barstool content has been because of these two - gotta love em.
5. **Dana Beers** \- LOL. Dude. Dana Beers - how is this guy real? Have you guys seen the new IG reel thing he's doing where he tries foods/drinks he's never tried before? So simple yet it's so funny because of how effortlessly retarded he is. And it's not a schtick. Don't you dare tell me it's a schtick. There's no way you can fake what he's doing dude. So fuckin funny. Guy tries cherry tomatoes for the first time - got a whole bowl of them in front of him. He doesn't pop one in his mouth like any normal human would do - no, he takes an entire fistful, just shoving about 7 or 8 of them in at one time as if they're tic tacs and proceeds to be shocked at how they explode in his mouth upon biting down. How about the Oklahoma drill against Max? Fucking died laughing. The case races. I mean I could go on forever. One of the guys where I feel I could just watch him talk about anything and you'd be guaranteed to laugh at least once ever 5 minutes and he wouldn't be trying to make you laugh at all. And even though he's dumb as a box of rocks, not gonna lie, kinda wanna hang out with the guy. Kinda wanna be friends with the guy. Just a dude. How can you not like this guy? Long history at Barstool too - Remember Zillion Beers? And by the way... ya'll seen this dudes wife? Congrats on the sex Dana, sheeeeesh. I'd make some joke about him ""outkicking his coverage"" or something along those lines, but nah - this is Dana Fucking Beers - he deserves everything he has. She is one lucky lady.
6. **Biz** \- Find me someone who doesn't like Biz. Not someone who thinks he's dumb or a jock or anything like that - someone that actually doesn't like him. That person can suck my dick and rot in hell. Biz is all time as a dude, as a friend, as an entertainer, as a protector - he is the definition of a ""Beauty"" as they like to reference in the hockey world. As if we all didn't love Biz enough before the Houstons/Irish Travelers debacle, man did he capture everyone's hearts and admiration after that. What a fucking champ. I mean seriously, what is there to knock on this guy? He's hilarious, clearly one of the nicest most genuine guys ever, total dude/type of guy everyone would want to hang with for a day or be lucky enough to be friends with. Oh and just as the cherry on top you know he's getting laid anytime anywhere by anyone of his choosing. And now he's made it big time outside the Barstool world with his big national TV gig on TNT - what can't this guy do? OK, enough of the glazing.. that got a little out of hand. But I guess that's the point of this list, isn't it? Biz is the man - anyone who says or thinks otherwise is a loser and a dweeb.
7. **Frankie** \- Alright, Frankie - one bite, everyone knows the rules. This might not be my most popular pick and one that may not show up on a lot of other peoples, but I dk... I've just really genuinely enjoyed following Frankie for a long time now. From being Dave's sidekick back in the day and doing all the pizza review videos to his spot now in Foreplay, I think Frankie is really funny, good at his job, and just a really good guy. I don't really have a whole lot else to say other than he's on this list because he's one of my favorites. Frankie, if you ever happen to see this, I just need you to know that I can't stop fucking say ""what're we doing, hittin' eggs?"". It's an actual problem. I say it after every putt I see. In person, on YouTube. Doesn't even have to be a soft putt. I just can't stop fuckin saying it lol. It's really not even that funny, honestly. Something's wrong with me. OK, I'm done - love Frankie - don't think he has many haters.
8. **Hank** \- I was about to type ""Hankyyyyyy"" in the Jerry O'Connell bing bong voice but then I remembered I fucking hate Jerry O'Connell. Weirdo. Too schticky for me. Anyways, this is about Hank lol. Hank is just a true guys guy. Lucky as hell to be in the spot he's in and certainly not all that talented. While some would maybe be jealous or despise that, I actually find myself liking him more for that. Sort of a fuck everybody mentality, i don't care what they think. I'm here because I'm an OG, I'm one of the guys, a made man, and you aren't gonna do anything about it haha. It's not like he acts that way - he's a nice enough guy, but I dk... in a day and age of political correctness and Barstool having to get a little more professional than how they used to be back in the day, it's nice having guys like Hank around in high ranking positions in the company for no other reason than just having been there for a long time and being one of the boys of everyone that matters. I enjoy the role he plays on PMT and for the most part enjoy any other content he decided to be a part of. Hank is just Hank and if you're an OG stoolie, odds are you ride with our boy.
9. **Max** \- Max really isn't even content but some of his content is the funniest out there ha. Everyone loves miserable Max after big losses of teams he loves, season ending games etc. And although it can feel like a bit of a schtick at times, it's more genuine and funny than it is schtick, for sure. When this dude gets fired up about something it can turn into some of the funniest shit ever. He's actually very similar to Rico in a sense. The more you bust this guys balls, the funnier he gets and the better for content he is. Oh, and don't let Max get drunk (but please actually do). Cockiest dude ever but honestly, in a funny way. Funny for us to be able to sit back and view, not so funny for him to have to watch back the next day lol. The guy that after 5 beers goes to 100% confidence and 10x speed with the yapper. Guy just won't stop talking but a lot of the time it's really funny. One of these times was something I mentioned before in the Dana writeup - Oklahoma drill... all time. Bunch of other content outside of this over the years too that has been epic. I like Max a lot - very entertaining to me.
10. **Tommy Smokes** \- Another guy with a ton of haters but cmon man... I had to give the OG Smokes a spot on the list. I'm a big time Tommy defender when it comes to people talking about how much they hate him. I know I've talked a lot in this post about ""schticks"". I generally hate these because it's way funnier/better to see people be authentic. But there are certain people capable of taking a schtick so far that it actually becomes one of the funniest things ever. People who appreciate humor recognize that, while others (all of Tommy's haters), just get hung up on the schtick and get pissed off. Dude, he's doing it on purpose... he's trolling lol. Tommy is so good at it and I find it hilarious. He's also just really good at stuff even when he's not trying to be funny - Tommy has depth. Survivor, The Dozen, a bunch of stuff. Fuck the haters, Team Tommy for life.

**Honorable Mentions**:

* Marty Mush - I actually think Marty is pretty funny. He's also a pretty strong athlete which most people don't realize. Also, how the fuck is Marty so connected with other athletes and celebrities? He's always getting the biggest pulls for the content he does. Anyways, this is more of a ""respect"" honorable mention than it is him actually being one of my favorites. When that entire Rhea/Hank/Marty thing went down, holy shit. I thought dude was absolutely cooked. And I was very much on the side of Hank, for the record (if you couldn't tell by my list of favorites). Like how is Marty still here? And doing decently well at that? All the most powerful and influential guys in the company hated his guts at the time and swore him off completely. That could not have been an easy 3-6 months for him, but somehow he's still here and he has Dave and Dan off his back. Oh, and he and Rhea are happily married. I dk, I didn't like him then, but I've gained a fuck ton of respect for the guy for pushing thru all of that, keep relationships on both sides of that fight and still being here today in plenty of different content.
* White Sox Dave - Haven't seen anything good out of WSD in a while, but a couple times a year you can guarantee there's going to be something funny as fuck stemming from something he did or said or is involved in. Just an all time character. That gum chewing video on the news? Holy shit lol. So funny. I like Eddie and Chief a bit too - no one from the Chicago crew good enough to make either of these lists though. Honorable mention, yes.
* Wonton Don - Gotta love this guy - another one with not many haters. Enjoyed the Turkey hair transplant series. Enjoy a lot of his travel stuff. I actually have yet to see the content he did with Biz... need to check that out.
* Daniella - Strictly a horny pick. Bonk etc. Real ones know. Been with the company a long time. Used to be Erika's assistant. Now Dave's personal assistant. I want to call her smoking hot (because she is) but that would almost be an insult because of how beautiful she is. And I'm not talking about today's day and age Instagram model bullshit looks/hotness. This is real woman beauty. What a gem. She has my heart.... and a lot of blood flowing to a particular part of my body.

**Notables left off either list** (if you're not here or above, you're kind of a 0 at Barstool to me):

* Francis
* Eddie
* Dante
* Frank the Tank
* Hannah Montoya
* Nicky Smokes
* Jersey Jerry
* Kayce
* Large
* Lil Sas
* Mintz
* Katic
* Robbie Fox
* Rudy
* Trent
* Moobie/Smelly

A couple of closing remarks:

* I'm not a fucking English major or author. I'm also not going to copy paste this thing into an AI chatbot and have it proofread - come at me for my takes, not my writing abilities and grammatical errors, please. Unless you're Francis - like actually Francis. Rip me to shreds in that case.
* I obviously don't know everything I said to be fact. I don't have any insiders at Barstool or anything like that. When I say that PMT, ForePlay, Chiclets are Barstools most valuable brands and in that order, it's just based off what I've gathered as a fan over the years.
* Embrace debate. I don't have a clue how Reddit fucking works. If I post this now, will it even be seen by anyone? Did I just waste an hour of my life typing this up for my own self? Lol, maybe, probably. Would I love for a lot of people to see it and debate it and comment on it and eventually make it's way into some piece of Barstool content? Nooooooooo, totally not why I did this man. Not at all, I don't care about Barstool. I don't watch any of their stuff. That would be super gay ha....................................",0,1761928210.0,barstool,1,0.5,False
1okz9o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1okz9o0/i_used_to_work_at_my_exgfs_blood_donorship_part/,I Used to Work at my Ex-GF's Blood Donorship (Part One of Three),"When I was in college, I only desired two things: a stable job in my field and a girlfriend. After I graduated, it seems that I got neither. They always told me that not everyone starts out with their dream job, and I finally understood that when I worked at my local grocery store for shit pay. I wasn’t ready to accept it then, even after 500 emails saying I didn’t fit the “matched” jobs, but I guess life had other plans for me. The best I could ever do was land this one. Four years of earning my degree only to use my university level training in scanning products, weighting products, and dealing with customers.


Things back home weren’t so good either. My parents got themselves into major financial debt just so that I could complete college. My dad was doing double shifts while my mom had to do three just to break even with the mortgage payments on top of it too. With me in that terrible job, it was the best I could do to contribute to them.



It wasn’t too bad though since I made a friend at the grocery store, his name was Victor. Loves Jesus as much as he loves horror movies. More than that, though, he was a beacon of hope to live on instead of just giving up. I even remembered speaking to my friend Victor about the latest movie we’d seen. It felt good to engage with him. It felt like a cushion to cope with the pandemonium of my post-college reality. Moreso by someone that understood me. The only warmth I felt in this dreary job was sharing a shift with him.



It was the day she showed up.
  


“So do you think that she got murdered in that shot?” he asked as he leaned over the checkout counter cross from me. From my perspective it felt like I was in a horror movie. The grocery store had a sickly yellowish white on the floors and everything else with build up of mildew seeping out of corners. The fluorescent lights buzzed and hummed as if they were a swarm of mosquitos. Yeah, I entertained the chances of this being my last shift.



“No way,” I replied. “I think it’s meant to leave people thinking.”



“Yeah that was what my girlfriend thought when we saw it.” He said as he scratched his chin hair. *My girlfriend*. My mind echoed those words. “So are you gonna go to that party I said about?”  
  
“Oh yeah, that party. I’d be down!” I replied as I thought the idea of a fun, brief, nostalgic return to college life was helpful. I needed that return to something that made sense. Definitely better than being here for minimum wage. I didn’t notice that he was about to head out for the day.



When he clocked out and said his goodbye, my mind fell, again, into that familiar destitution. It was as if I was sinking deeper into an ocean of despair reaching conclusions like how I won’t be spending the rest of my life with someone *other* than my family. *My Girlfriend*. I had the notion that by sharing my life with someone I love and trust, things would be easier. I was naive to believe that, but I did back then. The congregation in my mind got into such heated feats of debate that I grew numb on the world around me. Eventually descending into despair. *How will this amount help my parents? Why can’t I just land a job that pays more? Why did Victor have to leave? Why am I so alone?* I wasn’t sure how long I was sinking like this. Minutes felt like hours here.



The remaining 30 minutes felt like I was in constant sleep paralysis. My eyes glazed and soggy as I got lost into the nihilistic nothingness that my mind could produce. All the while I heard the sounds of chattering customers whose breath smelled like what they ate, coworkers that were vexing imps, and a carousel of pop music that played over and over again. I heard the same 10 songs since the afternoon alongside the comforting smell of the store’s aroma of rotted vegetables and vinegar. David Bowie was singing for the 17th time before getting cut to another popular song reaching its own 17th.



While this was the most torturous amount of time spent that I’ll never recall the next day, it wasn't not all that bad. At this hour, the store would be barren of all the usual customers that you’d see. So, when a customer does show up, they'd tend to be the weirdest ones, and it was the most memorable part working late hours here for better or for worse. I felt the tapping of footsteps approaching my counter with their items of choice. I was about to open my mouth when the words got caught in my throat as the world disappeared when I saw … *her*.



I was not really that big into goth girls. I've only ever seen them online, so when I saw her, it really caught me off guard. She was a tall gothic princess; dominated in high heeled boots with silver strappings, making her about 6 ft tall. It led up to her long bluish-black dress that was only separated by both her snow white thighs and purple belt shaping her figure. Following up, her neck wore both a black choker and a silvery necklace that had a silver ankh attached to it. She also had some of those ankhs on her ear piercings, and it was only when I noticed her lip piercing did I get a good look at her face.

  
  
Her face was heart shaped with ivory soft skin, rosy cheeks, and maroon red lips which gave her look doll-like and innocent. She had her jet black hair tidied up to two high pigtails broken by strands of lavender to match her smell. Finally, I looked deep into her pale blue eyes that reminded me of the ocean. An endless sea crashing against the sand on a cloudy gray mourn. So hypnotic to just forget about all the dumb problems that anyone had to deal with in the cruel things life had to offer. A feeling so true to anyone in a grocery store uniform and apron.



I snapped back into reality as I was rushing to scan all of her items as she was just looking at me curiously. She didn’t say anything at all, just looked at me. It was kinda freaky, and it made me more nervous than I should. I never got that kind of attention at all. Especially from someone this beautiful.



“S-Shit, s-sorry ma’am. U-uuh, how was your night? Did anything interesting happen?” I asked as I was shoving an eggplant into a bag. Usually, I’d wait for other items that match its type for neatness. She didn’t respond. She had a solemn expression which made her lips look pouty and plump. Her eyes, however, showed the most activity. She kept looking at the groceries and mostly at me. Those pale blue eyes moved precisely like crashing waves; was she analyzing me? What was she trying to find in me?



It was hard not to look, but I had to focus on my job even as I felt the heat on my face and her stare when typing up the total. The store was spinning all around me, and I kept miscalculating the total and the cash she was giving me. I cursed when I dropped a dollar as I went to pick it up, I hastily opened the till and gave her her change as I met her pale beauty again.



I wanted to say something. Anything to make her say something. But I didn’t. I felt frozen there with the change in my hand as she took it, nodded and left. My eyes followed her until she was gone. I was allowed to breathe again as my heart was racing miles and my mind was running marathons with thoughts. *Who was she? I didn’t get time to get to know her. Is she single? Obviously she was not, since she looks gorgeous! BRO JUST LEAVE HER ALONE, she just wanted groceries.* I was able to clock out after 30 minutes, but she was long gone by then. I thought that I wouldn’t see her again. The notion left me wilted and went back to my car morosely. At the very least, I got something to talk about at that house party, I guess.



\*\*\*



Victor and I parked over to the house in some suburban place, and man, was this guy throwing a party. It was like a frat party. There was toilet paper thrown over the house and tree branches as if they were party ribbons and disco colors flashing on hues in cue with the pulsing, booming music that made anyone on a 20 mile radius want to call the police. People on the porch were either leaving because they were done or just puking up their drinks, and entering would walk slowly to record those puking. Me and Victor didn’t do it out of pity.



As if the outdoors wasn’t ravenous enough, it was truly a jungle when we entered inside. People were bouncing to the beat of the music blaring somewhere in this two story house. Guys laughing in friend groups and some trying to hit on some girls there. Some were even doing a drinking game with beer pong. Toilet paper around the ceiling fans and stair railings as it was outside, and a banquet of various chips and drinks. I helped myself with a drink and filled it with some soda - never get punch in parties - and it reminded me a bit about college life seeping in. My sinking mind was sidelined when Victor was shouting at me about something.



“What?” I shouted over the music.



“I said ‘so she just looked at you?” he replied.



“Jeez man, I didn’t know what to say at the moment,” I said as I sipped the last of my drink.



“I mean it’s okay man, people usually mess up at first,” he said as he took a swig. “But if you ever see her, just ask her out for some coffee! I mean who knows, \*hic\* maybe she’ll be here? This house seems big enough to fit the city in, so I guess she’d be here?”



“I don’t know man,” I said pensively, staring deep into the empty cup. I have seen other people say that that’s a good way to start. Maybe I’ll give it a try if I ever get that chance.



“Nah,” he said, putting a hand on my shoulder. “I’m sure she’ll show. Maybe someday, you’ll get to talk to her! Just ask her about a coffee date thing. Ya know? Anyway, \*hic\* I’m gonna find Lucy, she said she got in the house.” I ended up alone again as I looked around the room. As much as I wanted to, I couldn’t get her off my mind since that day.



*Maybe Victor was right. Maybe that goth girl would show up here*. I thought. Scoffing at the idea, I went to get more to drink my problems away. While I was pouring it in, I heard a husky  voice behind me say, “Hey, I’ve seen you before.” I turned around and my heart stopped. Paralyzed and clutching at the table, I looked and was petrified.



*Holy shit*. 



She no longer looked like a princess but she definitely dressed more for party fashion. Same boots but now with the addition of fishnet leggings to match her dark micro short jeans, a crop top, some band called TOOL. on it, and those same piercings on her ear and lip. She had her hair fixed in an updo which made her look a bit regal with loose lavender strands*.* She looked at me with those eyes that lit up in all colors from the party lights and the warm glow of the lights gave a magical touch in the air as I got my second chance. Her eyes widened to match mine, maybe a bit too playfully as her black lips formed a smile.  
  


My mind was having a heated debate again, much to my exhaustion. *Yo, you gotta talk to her this time! No, leave her be, might be taken already! But why would she show up to him, again?!* The internal congregation in my mind ceased when I decided that this was my only chance to talk to her. I drank my fears, swallowed, and began to speak. It felt like a century just to say hi. She smiled. It became harder to say anything at that point. The party music was drowning, the walls closing in and my mind struggling to grope for something, anything to say.



“Y-y-yeah, the cashier guy.” I drawled long with a nervous gaping smile. *God, I’m so lame.* She snorted and smiled that deadly smile as she hid her mouth to take a sip of her drink; she filled in the awkward silence that followed.



“So, like, how long have you been working there?” She asked.



“Uhh, about a year now."" I said without realizing the pain. A year of this bullshit.



“Do you … like it there?” She seemed like she didn’t want to insinuate anything, but my face must have given her the answer. “Well, uhh, have you considered doing something else? A side hustle?"" She said as she smiled again. Teeth and all; Her canines were as perfect as she was.



“What are you getting at? I don’t even… ahh crap,” I said before realizing. I gave out my hand to her. “I’m Damian. Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.” I said as she took it. I didn’t expect her hand to be so cold. Maybe it was the AC in the party house.  
  


“Madeline. But you can call me Maddy,” she said as she locked eyes on mine and said, “Damian.” The way she said it gave me a deeply bubbly feeling from my nave to my chest. I felt a bit better. I knew that she was trying to seduce me, but I guess not enough to pull me over.



“So, *Maddy*, what concert have you been to?” I said as suave as I can be. I guess talking about this TOOL band would be the best way to avoid the subject of my crashing career. She got deep into thought, as if to dig deep into her memory.



“Uhh, I have been to, I think, the one in Detroit, Michigan. I don’t remember the type of concert but it was when they weren’t as big as they are now. I haven’t been into concerts as much though.” She said.



“Have you been to Detroit? You moved in?” I said.



“Yeah, I thought I could start a new life here. Too hot over there, you know?.” She said as she fixed a part of her shirt. 



“I’m pretty sure Detroit was just as cold as here” I said.



She looked back at me. “Yeah it was to me at least. So how about you? Have you been to a concert?”



“Oh umm,” I thought hard. I rubbed the back of my neck while thinking about something to say. I didn’t know much about this band at all, but I didn’t want to sound like a wimp either. As I was thinking of something to say, I spotted both Victor and Lucy as they were watching me, Lucy giggling while Victory nodding his head with a grin of approval before waving at me. I turned to Madeline. “Uh Hey, I spotted my friends spying on us, you want to meet them?”



She snorted. “Sure, weirdo.”



I went over to where Victor and Lucy were. I introduced them to Madeline and likewise as we discussed further about metal bands. I shouldn’t be surprised that she has another band called Deftones as well as horror movies to which Victor interrogated her about what her favorite scary movie was. She got us to talk about that movie again. Her take was interesting. She mentioned how the girl's wounds left untreated would cause her to die by exsanguination. I looked puzzled a bit.

  
“Since when did you take medical school?” Victor asked.



“I just think it's good to know the human body and how to treat it. You know?” Madeline replied. “My family and I work with blood donations and since my parents needed someone that can take up the day shift, I was the perfect choice. Say that reminds me,” She turned over to me. “We’re looking for someone to fill in a vacancy, and I was wondering if you’d like to sign up?”



I looked at her with shock. A job? Right, that side hustle she mentioned earlier. The more she described the role and benefits, the more I wanted to apply. It was definitely better than being just a grocery clerk. I thought of the potential amount of cash flowing in to help my aging parents. How proud they’d be of me that their son got a role that pays better.



“So where can I sign?” Victor added jokingly before I got to ask.



“Oh sorry, it’s only for one,” She said as she looked at me and gave me a business card. “I’d like to meet you at the bus’ location. I think you’d be a great fit for the role.”  
  


I took the card she gave me as we continued talking. My head was in the sky amidst the noise as I held onto her card. This girl and her job offer lifted the gloom of my hometown as I realized that I can have my cake and eat it too. It came to an end as Victor shook me back to earth.



“Hey man come on now. We got work tomorrow, and I got to do something with my dad.” Shit, I forgot about that throughout all of this. So we were on our way out of the party, not nauseous at all, and as we did, Madeline said something that I always wanted to hear, and something that sealed my fate forever.



“Hey so like, do you want my number?”  


That was how I met my girlfriend. I wish I never had.",3,1761928197.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Any ideas?","I’m learning French as a beginner, and I have conversation classes where we’re encouraged to talk freely… but sometimes I don’t want to go too personal. So I came up with this idea: why not invent completely absurd little stories or “lifestyle decisions” to talk about in French?

The goal is to:
	•	Practice speaking more fluently, using beginner vocab
	•	Avoid going too deep into personal stuff
	•	Keep it light, fun, weird, creative
	•	Give both me and my teacher something to laugh about! 😄

So far, here are a few ideas I’ve been working with, plus a little summary and some French vocabulary to go with them:


🛁 1. The Daily Shower Commitment

🗣️ “C’est difficile, mais je continue. C’est mon cadeau pour le monde.”
📘 Vocab: une douche, tous les jours, sacrifices, propre, le monde

⸻

🥤 2. The Morning Smoothie Philosopher

Story:
Each smoothie is a philosophical journey. Banana and spinach = inner conflict. Mango and coconut = harmony in chaos. You now refuse to drink smoothies without a life lesson attached. You’ve started a blog about it. It’s called “Blender de Vie.”

🗣️ “Chaque smoothie est une réflexion sur la vie.”
📘 Vocab: le smoothie, mélanger, la vie, les idées profondes, le goût

⸻

✍️ 3. Left-Handed Writing Challenge

🗣️ “C’est lent, c’est moche… mais je suis une nouvelle personne.”
📘 Vocab: la main gauche, écrire, lentement, changer, l’esprit

⸻

🥐 4. Breakfast All Day

Story:
You’ve decided that breakfast is the superior meal, so you eat it for every meal. You believe this lifestyle has improved your mood, digestion, and global peace. Croissants for dinner? Absolutely. Oats at midnight? Obviously. The movement is called “Petit-déj pour la paix.”

🗣️ “Le monde est meilleur avec des croissants le soir.”
📘 Vocab: le petit-déjeuner, manger, le dîner, les croissants, la paix

⸻

✒️ 5. Everyday Poet

Story:
You write daily poems about mundane things like brushing your teeth, waiting for the microwave, or missing a sock. You now see poetry everywhere and claim your life is a living haiku. Your next plan is to publish a book titled “Dentifrice et Destinée.”

🗣️ “Tout est poésie, même les chaussettes perdues.”
📘 Vocab: un poème, écrire, chaque jour, la beauté, le quotidien

⸻

🌱 6. Weather Forecast for Houseplants

Story:

📘 Vocab: les plantes, la météo, arroser, parler à, le soleil

⸻

☕ 7. The Traveling Mug

Story:
You believe your coffee mug has a secret life and a long past. It has been to Egypt, New York, and maybe the moon. You talk to it every morning and thank it for choosing you as its current human. You’re planning a documentary: “Tasse sans frontières.”

🗣️ “Elle a une âme. Et beaucoup d’histoires.”
📘 Vocab: une tasse, voyager, imaginer, ancienne, le destin

⸻

🧥 8. Shrunk Clothes Fashion Movement

Story:
You accidentally shrunk your clothes in the wash, but now you wear them as a statement. You call it “compression couture.” It’s fashion. It’s bold. It’s a little cold, but it’s worth it for the looks. People on the street stop you and say: “Wow, is that Paris?”

🗣️ “J’ai froid, oui. Mais je suis une icône.”
📘 Vocab: les vêtements rétrécis, la mode, avoir froid, stylé(e), oser

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1okz4dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalPiano/comments/1okz4dz/pianomotion_give_life_back_to_selfplaying_piano/,PianoMotion - Give Life Back To Self-Playing Piano,"Bonjour! I’m a piano and tech enthusiast, and I just finished developing **PianoMotion**, an Android app (totally free and free of ads!) that lets you play **any piano MIDI file wirelessly via Bluetooth** on your acoustic player piano (Yamaha Disklavier, Steinway Spirio, Bösendorfer CEUS, PianoDisc, QRS, …) no more need of DKC-900 or DKC-850...

📥 **Download the APK here:**https://github.com/KevinChopin/PianoMotion

How it works:

1. Plug a **Bluetooth MIDI adapter** (Yamaha MD-BT01, CME WIDI Master, or any compatible model) into your piano’s MIDI ports.
2. Connect your phone via Bluetooth.
3. Load any piano MIDI file.
4. Press **play** – watch your piano perform!

**Why I made it:**

There are very few accessible apps that truly unlock the magic of these instruments. I wanted to create something **simple, free, and ad-free**, so anyone could enjoy their piano, no matter its age.

I built **PianoMotion** because it was frustrating to see manufacturers either **offer only poor-quality apps** for their pianos or **abandon older instruments entirely**, pushing you to buy a new one without proper software support. With PianoMotion, you can **play your favorite MIDI tracks, record your own performances, revive old Disklavier floppy disks**, (and soon even **sing along while your piano plays the backing**!). NB: App is currently in French but English version is coming soon.

Features:

* 🎵 Play MIDI files wirelessly via Bluetooth
* 🎹 Record and replay your own performances
* 🔜 Soon: “Voice + MIDI” mode – sing while your piano plays + Spotify or Deezer auto convert stream to midi
* 💖 Completely free and ad-free

**Try it & Give Feedback**

I’d love for everyone to try PianoMotion. Your bug reports, suggestions, and feature ideas are what will help make this app better and more enjoyable for the piano community.

1okz2nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1okz2nn/looking_for_insight_help/,Looking for insight & Help,"Hello everyone 

I'm reaching out to possibly get some insight on schizophrenia. My cousin, Mandy (fake name) visited me a few months ago and I noticed some odd behavior with her. At the time I thought it was just anxiety manifesting because I have anxiety (diagnosed) and was seeing some of the symptoms of it in her behavior. 

However as her visit went on with me, her thinking and ideas became somewhat...out there and a little wild. She was talking about getting a large plot of land in the middle of America and building a 'doomsday farm' where all of our family could make it a self sufficient self sustainable place for us to all live and be around each other.  

She also has a paranoia going on of being tracked by her child's father (he is not tracking her and family keeps in touch with him) she is constantly on the 'run' from him. She called me at one point after she left and told me she thought a PI had found her in a coffee shop and David (fake name for child's father) had sent them to track her down so he could serve her. Shortly after this maybe a few days she called again and said she thought there was a tracker on her car and took it to an auto shop for them to look at it (it wasn't a tracker she told me). 

I'm not entirely sure of the timeline for the rest of this but talking with family members who have witnessed some of the behavior had these incidents to offer below.

Instance one:  her mother and her were walking a trail I believe and she went crying up to her mom saying that Ryan (fake name for her child) his soul had suffered thousands of years of pain and torture and that if anything happens her mom needs to love him and take care of him.

Instance two: she was getting into Tarot cards and told her mother that our deceased grandmother was talking to her

Instance three: she was staying with her mother and they were going to drive somewhere the car was filled to the roof almost with trash (rotting fruit, general trash) her mom couldn't get the car seat in properly and cleaned the car out because she didn't want her grandchild to be in that for the ride and it was difficult to place the seat in. Mandy came out and was hysterical and angry about her car being cleaned out.

Instance four: she sold her house and purchased a hitch up camper so she can travel around and live in RV parks while 'on the run'

Instance five:  she was talking to her mom and told her in a serious tone that, ""I know everything."" And when her mom asked again what she said, ""I KNOW everything""

Instance six:  she said and believes she is Lilith.( I'm not sure which Lilith she is referring to. )

Instance seven: while she was visiting I did bring up her possibly getting medication for anxiety (because this is what I thought was manifesting at the time) and she was adamant on natural cures etc such as essential oils and meditation.

Instance eight:  this instance won't help her with her paranoia but her mom and child's father were concerned for her and the kid they DID track her down to California and showed up to check on her as she has completely cut off ALL communication with family. They said when they showed up she was shaking in anger, screaming at them to get out and she was trying to get away from you! 



Family will be reading this post and replies



 we are concerned for her well-being and her kids well being. Any insight on this we would appreciate as we feel very lost right now and are truly unsure how to help her. She needs help and we are looking for some outsiders perspective on what may be going on with her, if this is possibly schizophrenia or something else we haven't thought about. Anything!   

Thank you for reading, and any insight you can provide. ",2,1761927751.0,schizophrenia,3,1.0,False

Thank you so much for all of the wonderful suggestions. I'm currently studying for an extremely important exam I'm taking tomorrow morning so trying to stay off my phone for the most part until after. I appreciate all the offers of peoples rewards it's incredibly kind and speaks volumes about people who have so little and are willing to share. I'm going to grab a bottle of caffeine pills
and I'll be right as rain. 

My coffee. I'm a mom with two kids and I'm in nursing 
school. I'm trying my fucking hardest to get myself out of poverty for my kids. The moment I found out I was pregnant I switched gears and went back to school but I can only go part time because of daycare costs so it's slow going but I'm making great progress and have a 4.0 gpa so far!

We're ""fine"" financially and will last several months with the food stamps we have. I immediately went into survival mode and stopped buying anything for myself that's a luxury like coffee but man it sucks. On the plus side I've lost 6lbs in two weeks forgoing breakfast and lunch so everything will stretch farther for my kiddos. 

Day 2 of no caffeine...can't wait for the migraines to stop. ",289,1761927669.0,povertyfinance,68,0.95,False
1okz12n,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1okz12n/i_drank_a_celsius_at_33_weeks_pregnant_im/,I drank a Celsius at 33 weeks pregnant. I’m freaking out.,"Just like the caption says, I drank a Celsius last week. I didn’t give it too much thought because I believed they only had 200mg of caffeine and didn’t contain anything harmful. 

We were on our way to a four day wedding and I needed a serious pick me up because I was so exhausted. 🤦🏻‍♀️

This morning I decided to do a Google search and turns out it has more caffeine than I thought and there are other ingredients that haven’t been tested with pregnant women. 

I normally drink around 1 cup of coffee a day, sometimes I don’t finish it. Other days I’ve had a latte with espresso. Never extreme amounts. Early on I did have a triple but this wasn’t something I did on a regular basis. 

I feel really bad after finding out about Celsius. This is also making me think about all the other times I may have over done it with caffeine. 

Anyone have any info on Celsius, caffeine intake, or drank Celsius and their baby turn out fine? I’m 34 weeks now and he’s bopping around in there. I love him so much. ",0,1761927650.0,pregnant,13,0.14,False
1okz101,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1okz101/question_about_daughters_sexuality_and/,Question about daughter's sexuality and relationship.,"My daughter is 9 and tells me when she thinks a boy is cute or has a crush, and has recently told me that she's kissed a girl and now she is dating another girl. I obviously have no problem, but I'm concerned about my daughter's welfare. The other girl Mom told her she had to break things off or she would be grounded, so my daughter said they are dating on the low. For background, my daughter has been going to pride since she was a baby and we've always taught her to be accepting and I'm very open about love is love and being accepting of others. My best friend is also a gay man and she spends a lot of time around him so this is completely normal to her.

So the dilemma, I was having coffee with a friend and she said she heard from a kid in my daughter's class that she's a lesbian with the other girl (it's a very small community). I laughed it off and said it's probably just a rumor, because this is not my secret to tell and I'm not going to out my daughter. But I do remember how difficult things were when I decided to come out and how other kids treated me. I know times have changed but I'm wondering what I should do for my daughter. I want her to be herself and feel accepted, but I also know that realistically people will have a problem with it. 

Any advice from other parents would be greatly appreciated. I just want what's best for daughter. And I'm not afraid at all of speaking up for her or defending her if anyone wants to talk shit.",6,1761927646.0,lgbt,0,0.88,False

Love photorealistic gourmand vanillas, but I am discovering I also like scents that lean into almond, tobacco, coffee, and leather. There seem to be plenty of options for these scents for colder months, but what do I wear in the summer?! (yes, I realize there is no hard or fast rule for scents and seasons, but I just want a reason to explore more!). 

A niche I could be interested in but don’t know too much about… nostalgic scents. (thinking… Steamed Rainbow? Annabel’s Birthday Cake- haven’t smelled them but have decants in my shopping cart).

I’m looking for a new pair of over-the-ear headphones that I can use for both work meetings and the gym. Ideally, something that works well in coffee shops and doesn’t pick up too much background noise during calls.

I know over-the-ear headphones aren’t the best choice for workouts, but I can’t wear earphones right now.

I’m also an iPhone user, so if anyone can share how well their headphones work within the Apple ecosystem, that would be super helpful.

She literally has empathy for everyone and everything except me. It's been like this since she was born like if I laughed she'd start wailing or yelling, I can be sitting quietly while she plays but the moment I make a phone call, or attempt to do a chore it's some emergency or another. Both of us her dad and I, are currently not working so it's not like she's not getting our undivided attention. This bleeds into her talking over me, telling me to be quiet and stop talking to dad. (Me and her dad have never told her to stop talking but her grandma has before which is where she got the phrase). Then she just f*cks off - its like any little thing that makes me happy she hates. She's a perfect angel for literally everyone but me  i hate it. I love her to the stars and beyond but my god is it frustrating, heartbreaking and exhausting. 

Today is day 3 of messed up sleep. I think I got 3.5 hours? My kid is 4 - there's absolutely no reason for her to be waking up at 4 am. She says ""I'm  hungry""  so I make her food which she then doesn't touch but heaven forbid I try and a make a coffee. Anyway I finally got fed up and said to her it hurts mommy's heart when you listen to everyone else except mum  you eat everything everywhere else except what I make at home and I frigging lost it and started crying. So what does she do? Fucking starts laughing at me. Like jfc, I get that kids lack that part of the brain but this is extreme. (And literally she is the sweetest most empathetic person to animals and kids, she loves to include everyone in her games like she's a wonderful kid...except to me. And we had a miscarriage in August and my dad died 2 weeks ago then she got the flu and now we're in no sleep mode and I think I'm just absolutely done.
