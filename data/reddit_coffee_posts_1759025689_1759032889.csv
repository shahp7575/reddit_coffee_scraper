1nsex34,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nsex34/the_footage/,The Footage,"We moved to the country for peace. At least, that’s what I thought.

The house was old. Two stories, white paint flaking off its sides like dried skin. The porch sagged. A single wind chime clinked even when there was no wind. Behind it, thirty feet of yard and then the woods—a wall of bark and shadow that swallowed the sun by afternoon.

May said it was nice and quiet.

She was a writer; she ate shit like this up.

It started with a fox. Late October. The leaves were bone-dry, and the sky looked peeled open.

May spotted it near the tree line. Limping, narrow as a branch, eyes hollow.

The next night she left out food scraps.

“Just in case she’s hungry,” May said, batting her baby blues at me. ""Just this once.""

This quickly became a daily ritual.

By November, she’d bought bulk dog food and stored it in a plastic container with a blue snap-tight lid.

Except she was always too busy to take it out herself. So, it became my responsibility.

Every night, I’d carry it out to this rotten stump and leave it with the lid off. By morning, something had knocked it over and picked it clean.

Routine.

Until the container started disappearing. I would walk out and find the lid and nothing else.

At first, it was rare. We would scratch our heads, and May would buy another one. We joked about it. Raccoons. Coyotes. A starving skinwalker.

But the more consistently it happened, the more annoyed May became. Her eyes lingered sometimes. On those woods.

“I want to know,” she said. “I gotta know.”

“Why?”

I was standing behind her while she worked on her laptop, fingers firing away at keys.

“I can’t focus,” May said. “Unless I figure this out.”

“Whatever floats your boat.”

She bought a trail camera. Cheap. Night vision, motion detection. She insisted it would pay for itself in satisfaction.

The first night we set it up, she asked me to seal the lid.

“If it’s shut, the thing’ll have to fumble it open. That’ll guarantee the camera picks it up.”

I didn’t like her referring to it as a ‘thing’.

“Animal,” I corrected as she adjusted the angle of the camera.

“Whatever.”

I carried it out. Clicked the lid shut and left it there like bait.

The next morning, it was gone. And the camera was facing the sky.

“What?”

May stormed out into the yard. “What happened?”

“Maybe an owl hit it,” I suggested.

“No!” she snapped, fidgeting with her phone. “I’m checking the footage.”

I made coffee while May fast-forwarded through hours of footage on her phone.

“It just turns!” She shouted from the living room. “Over the course of an hour! It slowly turns up!”

I glanced out the kitchen window, swallowing the lump in my throat.

“I’ll buy another one!”

“Are you…” my voice faltered.

Through the window, I saw it.

The container was there on the edge of the woods. A twisted and broken piece of plastic.

It wasn’t there a moment ago. Something was out there.

“May,” I said. “Maybe we should stop putting food out.”

Silence.

I looked over my shoulder into the living room.

May was on the couch, staring at her phone. Her expression was blank.

“May?”

May straightened and looked up. “What are you talking about?”

“The container is out there.”

“Huh?”

She hurried into the kitchen when I didn’t answer, spotting the container.

“When did that get there?” She ran from the kitchen, appearing in the backyard a moment later. She ran across the open, ponytail bouncing.

I stared, something twisting in my stomach.

It was out there.

The thing.

She slowed to a stop, kneeling over the container. She picked it up and waved it in the air.

“Come back,” I whispered. “Hurry up.”

Behind May, the trees rustled.

She stood and ran back to the house, mangled container in hand.

Later that day, she went shopping. She came home with a new container and an extra camera.

This camera was more expensive. She didn’t tell me the specs of it.

“I’ll set it up so they’re within view of each other,” she said. “That way, whatever moved it last time can’t do it again without being seen.”

That night, May put the food out herself.

I sat on the couch, staring at the mangled container on the coffee table. It looked like it had been twisted until it simply came apart.

When May came inside, she looked content.

“I miss the city,” I said as she joined me on the couch.

“The city is for pussies,” May said, kicking the mangled container. “It’s too expensive.”

My gaze lingered on the container.

“What do you think did that?”

“I think it’s wolves.”

I peeled my eyes off the container and gawked at her.

“Wolves? May, you’re joking.”

“Nope. I think there are wolf people out there. They must be struggling to find game if they’re scrounging for dog food in people’s backyards.” She devolved into laughter as she said it.

I wasn’t even smiling.

May's brown eyes lit up. 

“Come on,” she said, taking my hand. “You want to sit out here and stew about torn-up plastic, or do you want to have sex?”

I let her lead me to the bedroom. But I couldn't get it out of my head. Were May's eyes always brown?

The next morning, May was gone when I woke up.

I found her in the backyard, standing over an empty container.

“May?” I lingered in the doorway, watching her.

She didn’t look up.

“What’s wrong?”

May’s head rose slowly, facing the woods. Her mouth was moving. Her hair shifted in a soft breeze.

The trees danced before her.

I stepped further out, squinting in the fresh daylight.

“Where are you going?” May popped out of the house behind me, holding her phone.

I jumped, whirling on her.

“May? But…” I looked back to the woods, finding nothing but an empty food container.

“It’s empty,” May said. “I already checked. Let’s see the footage.”

“May,” I said, injecting as much steel into my voice as I could manage. “I just saw you outside. Where have you been?”

May cocked an eyebrow at me. “I’ve been on the couch for ten minutes,” she said. “I literally watched you zombie walk to the door and stand there slack-jawed like an idiot.”

I stared at her. Was I half asleep?

No.

I knew what I saw.

Maybe it was someone who happened to look like May…. wearing the exact same outfit.

“Come on,” May groaned. “I want to see the footage. You coming or what?”

I stiffly followed her to the couch as she pulled up the camera app on her phone.

We watched the first camera’s footage first.

The video started ordinarily. A possum. Wind moving branches.

Then at 2:43 am the screen glitched. A splice. Like something had stitched itself into the feed.

Tall and thin. Arms that ended in stumps. Its body was static, as if the footage was being burned where he stood.

Where its head should’ve been, there was a fan—a wide, spiraling crest of human eyes, each moving on its own. Some bloodshot. Some glassy. Some wet and oozing pus.

Then, one by one, they turned. Each eye settled on the camera.

They stared.

We stared.

Neither of us spoke.

One of the eyes grew closer, the pupil splitting apart as it filled up the camera. 

It was familiar to me. I couldn't place how. 

Then the feed cut out.

A crack zipped across May’s phone. She yelped and dropped it.

I couldn’t speak.

May was grinning.

What was she grinning about?

“May.”

“We found it,” she said. “I got it on video!”

“May, what the fuck are you talking about?”

“It saw me. It saw us, don’t you understand?”

I stood slowly, backing away from her.

May barked a laugh, raising both hands to her face.

My blood ran cold.

“Now it’ll know. It’ll see us wherever we are. We’ll always be seen.”

There was a knock on the door, and I screamed.

May laughed again.

I looked from her to the door, trying to keep my breathing steady.

Another knock.

A shadow moved across the curtained window.

“Come on,” May said. “This is what I’ve been waiting for. We’ve been out here for months. Finally!”

“May, are you serious right now?”

“Shut up, the good parts happening!”

I was trembling where I stood.

The shadow returned to the window. Tall and shifting. The part that should be its head split, spreading out like a fan.

Another knock. The door rattled.

May stood and approached the window.

“Don’t you want to know?” She asked, peeling the curtain back. “Aren’t you curious?”

I closed my eyes. I couldn’t tell you why I did it; it was just a reflex. Like a child flinching when a parent shouts.

Silence.

A strange warmth.

Glass shattered.

When I opened my eyes, May was gone.

And a food container sat on the floor by the window.

1nsewqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1nsewqg/the_real_reason_you_crash_at_2_pm/,The real reason you crash at 2 pm,"For the longest time I thought there was something wrong with me because every single day, like clockwork, I’d completely crash between 1 and 3 pm. I’d open my laptop, stare at the screen, sip another coffee, maybe scroll a little “to get going,” and then suddenly it was 4:30 and I had nothing to show for it. I’d beat myself up, tell myself I was lazy or undisciplined, and then try again the next day… only for the same cycle to repeat.

Then I stumbled across a few articles on circadian rhythms. Apparently most people have a natural dip in alertness in the early afternoon. So I rebuilt my daily schedule around my energy instead of the clock. Roughly, this is how it looks now:

* **Morning (roughly 8–12):** This is when I’m sharpest, so I only do deep work here. Writing, coding, problem-solving, studying, whatever requires actual focus. I’ve gotten strict about blocking distractions during these hours, I use distraction blockers for this, mainly clearspace and Timeslicer, and it’s insane how much more I get done when I protect this window.
* **Afternoon (1–3):** I’ve stopped pretending this is a good time for anything ambitious. I use it for admin tasks, going to the gym, or sometimes even a quick nap. I used to feel guilty about that, but now I see it as using those hours the way they were meant to be used.
* **Late afternoon to early evening (4–7):** This is when I get a second wind, but it’s not as strong as the morning. I usually save brainstorming, calls, or lighter project work for this slot. It’s productive, but not “deep.”

What’s funny is that I’m not actually working more hours overall. I’m just matching the right type of work to the right energy window. That single shift made a bigger difference than all the productivity “hacks” I tried before. 

I’m curious if other people here have noticed the same thing. Do you feel that sharp crash around 2 pm? Have you tried restructuring your schedule instead of pushing through it?",1,1759032653.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1nseqdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nseqdk/the_great_toilet_paper_hoard_of_2024/,The Great Toilet Paper Hoard of 2024,"I honestly thought I’d seen it all when it came to shared living, but the Great Toilet Paper Hoard of 2024? That one still makes me laugh-cringe. It all started subtly. One roll in the bathroom, then two, then suddenly, the utility closet was *packed*. Not with communal rolls, mind you. No, each housemate had their own designated stack, clearly labeled with masking tape and varying levels of passive-aggressive sharpie declarations. ""MINE. DO NOT TOUCH. Seriously."" was my personal favorite, courtesy of Liam.

I mean, I get it. We've all been there – that desperate moment when you reach for the roll and it’s just… a cardboard tube. But this? This was next level. It was late autumn, and the supermarket sales on bulk TP had apparently unleashed some primal hoarding instinct in our little urban apartment. I usually just grabbed a pack when I was out, tossed it in the communal cabinet, and figured it'd balance out. Highkey, I thought everyone else did too. I was wrong. So, so wrong.

The tension started building, silent but palpable. Someone would finish their roll, only to find the ""communal"" cabinet empty. Then they’d eye Liam’s fort of Charmin, or Maya’s neatly stacked Scott, or even my own modest stash I'd just bought. You could feel the unspoken questions hanging in the air during our casual kitchen chats. “Anyone… seen any spare toilet paper?” Maya would ask, her voice a little too sweet. Liam would just grunt, staring pointedly at his phone. I’d just shrug, feeling guilty for not being more assertive about the shared supply. It was getting kinda ridiculous, honestly.

The breaking point came during our monthly house meeting, which usually devolved into a debate about who left their coffee cup on the counter the longest. ""Okay, but seriously,"" I started, taking a deep breath. ""The toilet paper situation is getting out of hand. We're literally hoarding rolls like it's the apocalypse, and then silently judging each other when someone runs out. This is not sustainable."" Everyone looked a bit sheepish. Liam, surprisingly, was the first to speak. ""Yeah, I get it. I just got tired of buying it and then finding it gone in a day. Felt like I was the only one restocking."" Maya nodded. ""Same, tbh. I thought I was being smart by buying my own.""

We ended up agreeing on a rota, like we should have done months ago. Each week, one person is responsible for checking the communal supply and buying more if needed, then adding it to a shared expense app. We even designated a single shelf for *all* the toilet paper, no individual stashes allowed. It felt like a weight had been lifted. The vibe in the apartment totally shifted. No more suspicious glances, no more passive-aggressive sharpie notes. We even started joking about ""TP Tuesday"" when it was someone's turn to restock. We all kinda learned that sometimes, what seems like a small, individual problem is actually just a communication breakdown waiting for a group chat resolution.

So she drinks the “decaffeinated” coffee and then says that she is on a roll with work, and she’s obviously very locked in and energized. That doesn’t make sense to me. Decaf doesn’t provide an energy boost so she probably drank regular coffee and so therefore the 4imprint employee was certainly incorrect! So the commercial does not rly show that they never get anything incorrect like… It’s so dumb and enraged me to the point that it literally made me want to join this subreddit and post about it.

Okay so, I (18F) recently cut things off with a woman I really really liked (26F). Now, when I first brought this to my friends they told me to go for it because they thought it would be something casual and fun. But I can’t do casual. 

So I met this lady at work. I was training to become a manager, and got transferred to the training cafe. This is where her and I met. Immediately there was a tension between us, and admittedly I was very flirty on accident. She wasn’t (as much) because she was being professional. I didn’t work with her much for the 3 weeks I was there. But the last week I was training I worked with her almost everyday. It slowly got more and more flirty, and we were just talking it up. We were the last ones to leave just because we were the managers, but we had the same route home. Until the interstate. So we would race at night and then we’d flip each other off, laughing, and then I’d take my exit. We didn’t start texting for real till my last time working with her. We were professional and didn’t act on anything while working together. The point is, we had a very movie like start, and it was very hard to deny my feelings for her. But I was conflicted with her age. I asked her to the fair (as friends) and we went and had a great time, we drove around and sang, then we went back to her place and we smoked. We didn’t touch really the whole night, but always were super close. Then she asked if I was staying, and I said yes because I was exhausted. She put a pillow on my lap and from there we both could tell the vibes. We obviously liked each other. We didn’t kiss, we didn’t make out, nothing sexual. We just talked and cuddled. 

I went over the next night, and the same thing happened. I stayed over, but this time I asked if I could kiss her. I initiated it, not her. We spent the next two weeks together, I stayed at her place every night, we’d wake up and we’d make breakfast and coffee, I’d make us dinner. We had work and split ways then got together after. We played card games to get to know each other, we watched movies. It was grown, mature, and the kind of love I want and need. For perspective, I’ve been paying bills since I was 12, I’ve worked full time through school since I was 14, I’ve always been known to be more mature for my age. I am. And my relationships never worked out because I wanted something grown and real. She gave the love that I gave others. I really liked her. We almost had sex but I pulled away because I was too scared to have sex before a relationship especially not knowing if her and I could really work. And she was sooo respectful and understanding. 

We connected so well, we gave each other the love we both wanted and craved. I ended things because a mixture of two things. One) I’m not ready for another relationship, my last one ended 6 months ago. I have an issue with guilt, and when I hurt people I bottle it up and condemn myself for it. Two) I was and am still unsure about the age gap. My mom and some of my friends are supportive because they’ve seen my past and they’ve met her etc. and then some of my friends are absolutely against it, and then many strangers are too. (Rightfully so). I felt too guilty continuing things with her when I wasn’t sure where it was going. She told me that I didn’t have to give up something good to heal, and that I deserve good love etc. I think I can get over the age gap, but that could be wishful thinking. I would be open to healing while talking to her, but the mixture of not being ready and not being sure about the age gap, makes it hard. I don’t want things to get too deep and then I pull out for the same reason and I hurt both of us even more. But a part of me feelings like I’m letting go of something that could be a one and only shot. She fit me perfectly, (very communicative, reassuring, funny, beautiful, and shared trauma, mature, ambitious, hard working, etc). 

I could write a bunch more about the experiences we had but, I should cut to the chase. Am I thinking too much about the age gap? Should I pursue this, or is that not smart?

Let me reiterate, she did not initiate ANYTHING. I pursued her.

TL:DR
I’m 18F and I really like this woman 26F. She likes me too, we have a great connection. I ended things because of two things, 1) not completely healed. 2) I’m still uneasy about the age gap. She’s not a weirdo, I promise lol. Anyway, is the age gap that big of a deal? Am I overthinking it? ",1,1759031761.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

This past week was the perfect mix of everything I love about living in the city - brunches and dinners with friends, booking a flight for an upcoming vacation, and even a third date with a promising guy!

# Assets and Debt

Total net worth: **$750k**

* Retirement: **$202k** combined ($58k Roth IRA, $130k 401k, $14k HSA)
* Savings: **$0**
* Checking: **$8k**
* Brokerage: **$540k**

I'm mostly invested in VOO, and I put on trades in my personal account for fun.

# Income

My yearly comp breakdown is **$250k base + $150k bonus**. Taxes take about 40%, so I **take home about $240k / year**.

# Money Diary

Total spend of the week: **$1101**, Sunday Sep 21, 2025 to Saturday Sep 27, 2025.

**Sunday ($557)**

I woke up and a strawberry and cream latte from Blank Street ($8). I had a celebratory birthday brunch with a few friends, and we covered the birthday girl's part ($79 for food, $24 for drinks). I’m planning a girls’ beach vacation in a couple months, and today I booked my plane ticket ($396). For dinner, I ordered delivery from a Korean spot I really like: pork bone broth and a seafood pancake ($50).

**Monday ($0)**

No spend day! I worked from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; breakfast and lunch were catered at the office, and my firm covers dinners when we work late.

**Tuesday ($6)**

I was automatically charged for monthly renters insurance ($6). Otherwise, this was another no-spend day, same as Monday.

**Wednesday ($44)**

I wrapped up work early, bought groceries ($44) and cooked myself a dinner of pan-seared branzino with garlic spinach and a few glasses of wine. I then put on some comfort TV at home to relax - my go to show is How I Met Your Mother!

**Thursday ($0)**

No-spend day. Same as Monday.

**Friday ($175)**

I left work early and had dinner at a Korean BBQ place with friends ($150) and a drink after ($25).

**Saturday ($319)**

I started the day with my typical weekend treat: a strawberry cream latte ($8)! In the early afternoon I went shopping in SoHo and found a new dress for my date that night ($261). I grabbed a quick late lunch ($50) before heading home to get ready.

I’ve only met this guy twice before, but it’s so easy to talk to him that it feels like I’ve known him much longer. He chose a lovely neighborhood Italian spot, and we sat together for hours talking over pasta and wine. He picked up the check (about $400). I really like him, he’s handsome, smart, ambitious, and fun, and it was such a great way to end the week.

# Reflection

I feel good about my spending this week! The plane ticket and the dress were large purchases, but they were for great causes: a beach trip with friends and a date I wanted to feel good for. Day-to-day, I don’t stress too much since work covers a lot of meals, and I’d rather spend freely on experiences and moments that make me happy.

I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I wrote here three weeks ago, back then I had been studying for a bit more than one month and was finding a bit difficult to deal with the teacher's tone sometimes.  Well, ever since I have been taking more lessons, dedicating a lot of time to improving and I'm happy to see even the most strict teacher complimenting me last night, as also finding different women wanting to dance with me during the social event. 

However,  I've got to mention that due to the kindness of the first lady that I met during the social events (two months ago),  I created for myself a whole trip and feelings started developing.  She's a student that has been studying since the beginning of the year and is much more advanced.  The combination of sweetness, kindness and curiosity were a bit difficult to resist, moreover we were dancing and speaking every week, mutually asking about our personal life and such.  Anyway, since I didn't want to be in the territory of suppositions any longer,  last night I decided to ask her out, and she declined in a very kind and respectful way  (upon asking her out for a coffee she said  ""hah you're so cute, but no.  Better,  I'll receive your invitiation for tequila another day"")  and then we went and danced for a while.  It was a soft and polite rejection and I totally get it.  My question is: 

Having to move on from these feelings that I had toward her, should I change my attitude with her at all?  during every social event I dance with many different women, and I greet them all warmly, with a kiss on cheek, and joke with them as it is the common thing in my country.

1nsegbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nsegbd/abusive_mom_gay_son/,"Abusive Mom, Gay son","I’ve really been struggling lately. So, I always feel like there isn’t a place for me to talk. A lot of the searches I do online talk about men with abusive mom’s growing up to abuse other women, but that isn’t my experience at all. My Mom even told me I would grow up to rape women. When she found a moldy sandwich in my bag because I forgot to eat it and it got lost in my bag, she stuffed it in my face screaming at me to smell it. She told me the five minutes of sex wasn’t worth the pain I gave her. I remember from childhood always being in fear for my life. I would be threatened to be kicked out on the streets regularly. Then when I ran away they called the cops. I told them they even told me to leave. My Mom told me I would never be as good as her because I would never make as much money as her. She almost ran me over with a car at one point and she’s an alcoholic. When she found out I was gay she told me the reason she drinks is because of how much of a wimp I am. My Dad was telling me since a young age I would grow up to be a garbage man. 

I didn’t do that well in Hs, but when I went to community college I had someone in my life who really stressed I needed to get good grades to become independent. And I did. But My Mom repeatedly claimed that I would’ve never gotten those grades if she didn’t wake me up every day, even though I would already be awake and she would bang on my door acting like she was the one who got me up. My Dad told me she drank because of me multiple times even though she’s been drinking since before I was born. I was constantly being screamed at and berated. 

When I did go away to School, my Mom told me the same thing that I only got there because of her. I explained I got good grades on my own and she wasn’t involved and she told me it was because College was easier than HS. 

I eventually cut my parents out of my life. At the time I was very interested in spirituality. I was doing Yoga. I had a Yoga teacher tell me (and I didn’t talk about this stuff often, but it came up) I just don’t think you can be a spiritual person unless you have a relationship with your Mom. Another spiritual teacher told me the same thing. And so did my boss at a feminist witchcraft cafe that I worked at. I swear I didn’t even talk about this stuff often or regularly. It’s just people ask about family so I told the truth. 

Fast forward I was in a relationship. My partner proposed to me, then he wouldn’t ever be intimate with me, and I found out first hand he was actively cheating on me. It’s COVID. We both were struggling with employment. He was telling me that I was going to be evicted. This wasn’t even true but I lost my temper and I hit him. Now I had never hit someone in my entire adult life, ever up until that point. Only reason I even phrase it that way is one time I shoved someone in HS, but that’s it. I’m not saying it was the right thing, but immediately cops were at my door and arrested me. At the time I had no one so I called my mom. She repeatedly told me to not worry about my stuff because it’s just stuff. I told her multiple times that I needed a police escort to get my stuff and she repeatedly told me to just get over it even though I had spent my entire life getting all of that stuff. I lost everything.

I ended up going home to my ex and begged him to let me stay because it was snowing outside. He said I could stay there, he even made me coffee, told me I could take a shower, let me play some music, but then cops showed up. And I know he called them and I ended up in jail for several months. When I got out it was January. It was in Denver. I was freezing sleeping under bridges. Eventually I met someone who offered me some money and I did the wrong thing and left the state on probation. My mom wouldn’t help at all, she wanted me institutionalized. When you’re homeless police really target you. I ended up getting arrested again, and I tried to escape, and they called it assault on a police officer even though I didn’t do anything to the police officer. 

I didn’t know where to go. My mom eventually reached out. Now I’m in a group home. With a felony on my record. And the group home it’s very conservative men in a very red town in Arizona. I’ve needed my parents help. Now I am working. I get I need to figure it out it’s just really fucking hard when you have DV on your record and you also have assault on a police officer on your record. I have a therapist but she doesn’t really say much about the abuse I went through. Nor does my care manager. I actually told him a lifetime of stories and his response was basically you need to not be triggered by your mom and that she loves you. 

I really want to get to Tucson, where rent is very affordable. But my parents are obsessed with keeping me in this red town. It’s so conservative here I don’t really feel safe at all. Anytime I talk about wanting to leave my parents keep trying to keep me here. And even when I talked about getting a place with a roommate it was “you don’t want to do that because you’ll have no idea who they are”

Even though I live in a place where random people move in and out all the time, where felons move in and out all the time, people who have been in shoot outs. Someone pulled a knife on someone here before. And they never listen. 

I get at the end of the day I might be able to move after I save up, but I just feel like I might need a co-signer. But I feel like I’m talking into the void no matter who I talk to about my situation.

I get my mom didn’t SA me. There was some physical abuse but nothing compared to other stories. And I feel like no one validates my pain. I know I’m an incredibly conscientious human being. I care a lot about world suffering. I just feel trapped. And like it makes people so uncomfortable if I ever talk about it. I’m also really smart, but I have so few people to talk to in this town. These people don’t even believe in science. I’ve met multiple people who are convinced the Earth is Flat. I just wish I had never hit my partner, but it feels so unfair that I lost everything over it. It’s taken my years to get anywhere close to my life getting back together. People regularly steal from me in this house too, and the housing costs here are outrageous. ",2,1759031169.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I just finished my latest original track called **“널 상상 (Imagine You)”**, and I’m excited to share it here.

It’s a **medium-tempo R&B pop song** with a bright K-pop vibe — smooth groove, uplifting mood, and clean male solo vocals. I wanted the song to feel like those little moments of daydreaming about someone special, when even simple things like sunlight or a cup of coffee make you think of them.

Musically, I focused on:

* A steady “boom-clap” rhythm with warm bass
* Light acoustic guitar strums and electric piano chords for a fresh texture
* Clear, emotional vocals that stay honest and heartfelt without too many vocal tricks

Lyrically, the song is about imagining a loved one’s daily life, hoping to be part of it, and sending unspoken feelings like a song carried in the wind. It’s dreamy but also a bit flirty, meant to leave listeners with a warm smile.

I’d really appreciate any feedback on the vibe, the mix, or even just how it makes you feel. Every comment helps me grow as an artist.

The whole way home had been a tirade of midnight orbit posters. The romance drama of the year according to every obnoxious magazine that had dethrowned any news of his new album. Worst of all was a big picture of kyoko leaning against the back of a blonde man with coffee ground eyes. The story  was a modern retelling of romeo and juliet, that revolved around two high schoolers caught in the forbidden love. The children of rival towns that were in fierce competition for eachother for the championship. Kyoko’s father the coach of her town’s baseball team, while the male league was the opposition’s ace. There wasn’t a single tv station or youtube channel without constant promotion. It was impossible not to be indoctinrated with the ads. He slammed his hand of the uppolsther seats



“Sho…” Shoko nervously begun to assure-



“I don’t care, its just getting annoying as hell seeing this all the time. Did they bribe the media companies or is this so crazy kyoko curse”



The car pulled into the parking garage below their building. Slamming the door and pacing towards the elevator he got lost in his thoughts. What was the leads name…Airzuma? What was she was gonna do for 12 episodes straight slobber, fawn, and wag her tail at some teen heart throb. He could see it now “Airzuma you’re the greatest baseball player ever! You’re practically the inventor of homeruns. Should I make sugared lemons for your game blah, blah, blah”. Where was the fun in watching something like that. He stepped into the elevator with shoko his foot tapping, tapping on the tile Shoko rigid as a streetlight.



“Shoko I’m staying at my place tonight” The door opened and he went home.



\~



He lay on the den floor, water sliding down his shoulders, a bath towel wrapped around his head, clutching the remote. the button on the channel guid was hovering over the title midnight orbit. He was gonna watch and have a laugh. She was kyoko, she had mastered the art of vengeance and darkness, the angel had shown that to him.She was unbelievable then but still, her in this….It was like asking a ghost from a haunted house to play a comedian in the circus. He knew kyoko in loved. He had lived kyoko in love. He had watched her pack lunches, craft compients, and laugh at joke. It didn’t give brooding forbidden desire. He clicked the tv onto the channel that was currently airing an episode.



As if sensing his agenda he had landed in the meat of an episode, on the bench of the dugout with a hat tilted over one eye laid Airzuma. At the other end of the dugout,  at the opening door leaning in was kyko with long brown hair and a baseball cap 



“Where is dad’s…” Her voice hitched in her throat and she looked at his sleep form. At first her eyes wide and then small and nervous. She went to turn and walk away when a quiet sleepy mumble left Airzuma’s lips



“No- I dont” His mumble got louder as he seemed to be fighting of a nightmare. Like she was lured to a siren’s call her head turned back and she swiftly walked to him and kneeled.



“Hey are you alright-” She whispered and then cut herself off sighing at her own impusliveness. His sleepy fingers grazed her knee as his arm rolled off the bench. She lit up red and then turned white as he begun his scared mumbles. Her eyes watched him as if she was trying to decode him, as if she could unlatch his mind, decode his nightmares and protect him from whatever he was fighting. While she played with the puzzle her hand floated above his heads, she hesitated and then gently brushed hair off his face. Sho watched, her fingers light like air tracing their way across his forehead. She tucked his hair behind his ear.



“You’re gonna be alright.” She said and brushed her finger through his hair again. They just stayed there for a little bit hand in hair sleeping and her watching again with those eyes, so quiet, that had their knowing. Quiet. He wanted to turn it off. But he couldn’t. Something was different. Something felt.. He didn’t have time to answer. The male lead Airzuma woke up.



“Rio?” He said surprised. She pulled her hand away. And went to step back but he grabbed it. The looked at eachother the silence so thick with tension. She looked down at his lips and then away surprised by herself. What the hell? What the hell??



“I shouldn’t have, we can’t. Our worlds are just too-”



He pulled her in and kissed her hard and then gentle, and she leaned in her hands back in hair and then the two pulled away laughing a little. And then she looked at him. Really looked at him. And sho slammed the tv off.



What the hell. 



He had kissed her plenty of times. Well maybe actually two. And none of them had ever been much of anything. Then he realized none of them had been anything. Had kyoko wanted to kiss him. That hadn’t mattered then and it didn’t now. There was no way he could hold her like that no matter how much he touched her. That stung. who could have that? Did this Ai-whatever have that. He had gotten that in this. Gross. Gross. And then he imagined himself sitting her and kissing her and her kissing him back it felt odd but what was it like to be wanted? Wait didn’t know what it was like to be wanted by her? hadn’t kyoko wanted him all those years. And then it hit him. He had never seen that kyoko. Who the hell was that kyoko. And who did she belong to? And then he realized that was a different kyoko in love and she was pulling from something that you couldn’t fake. His mind suddenly, like an unwanted gift imagine her and ren they way he saw them together at that hotel in guam, together in the tv show interview. he could imagine him. Ren,  laying on that bench instead of Air-whateever and kyoko and it all made sense. He could see her looking at him, with loose silent knowing eyes.  How the hell did they have that understanding between them?... andwhy the hell could he have her like that. What else had they done.

I’m a recent grad living in Detroit. I was hoping to move with my partner to LA when he finished school, but that relationship is no longer.

I originally always thought I’d end up in NYC, grew up visiting multiple times a year, and am a very blunt person. So people have always kind of associated me with that city.

But I actually lived there during an internship for 3 months and had a really hard time. I love NYC, the city itself is awesome, always something to do, but god was it hard and so lonely and intense. It felt like the highest highs and the lowest lows. My best friend lives in the city, but otherwise no meaningful relationships there.

I wanna work in entertainment (hence adamance about nyc/la), and most the people I know from school end up in LA, so I’d have community there. In my industry too. But it’s just never where I saw myself living until recently. Where I’ve been much more team NYC in the debate, but previously was hesitant because I thought the city was vapid. Maybe I’m misinformed!

All the online quizzes for LA & NYC are stupid and will determine which city based on if you answer smoothie or black coffee as your cafe order.

Any advice on how to actually figure out which city you’re more suited for living in??? Things beyond just traffic versus transit. I’ve lived in both car centric and subway centric. It’s not a dealbreaker either way. I’ve visited both LA & NYC and still feel torn!",0,1759030587.0,AskNYC,4,0.33,False

i'm gonna list the violations so far, and i guess im just wondering how serious this is? it seems minor on paper and several people are really frustrated with me for getting him arrested, but i'm terrified he's going to hurt me and I can't really shake the feeling.

\-used his mom as a 3rd party to tell me what he wanted from our former home

\-has posted things about our sex life, alluding to his ex but not mentioning me explicitly

\-saw me in town and stayed nearby for about an hour

\-saw me at a concert, walked near the concert to look at me, then went to a restaurant within radius of the venue. reported this, nothing done.

\-one week later, his friend saw me at an event in town, and then did a second pass I think to figure out where I was because he stopped after he saw me again and then disappeared. My ex showed up about 20 minutes later with a different friend, and noticed me from a ways away but walked past me anyway. closest he's been to me so far, got within about 10 feet and just stood there, staring at me. I got up and he didn't move, just watched, until he realized I got a photo. went to a bar within the radius after he walked away. reported this too, he was arrested and charged.

\-figured out I was going to be at another event, and chose to go to a concert venue just 10 feet outside the radius (i don't go to a lot of events, but he does, so it's just weird that every time I go to something big he seems to be near me). stopped reporting because it felt like i wasnt being taken seriously, and this seems smaller than standing and staring i guess.

\-using my cell number for rewards at a coffee place, so I get texts when he goes to it

\-has posted screenshots of conversations with coworkers that are very clearly about our sex life

i'm just so confused. i havent lost any friends, really, and i've gotten a lot of support from people i truly love. but we all just kind of sit there and wonder how the guy we knew could be capable of this? it's so hard to think that he's doing this intentionally but that's a lot of events, and it's been just over 6 months. and those things seem benign, especially since we are not together and he hasn't physically assaulted me since a couple months before we broke up. do i need to go to the police again or should I just assume it's accidental if I'm not getting hurt",2,1759029972.0,domesticviolence,4,1.0,False

Let's start with the dyeing differences. Imported Himalayan leather has the following characteristics: First, the pores are extremely obvious, the color transition of the coffee part is natural, and the texture is three-dimensional. Due to the high price of imported leather, the selected leather embryos are of excellent quality, so the water dyeing process can be used, and the effect is natural and realistic, with the middle white part being milky white.

In contrast, domestic Himalayan leather mostly uses inferior leather embryos that are leftover after being screened abroad and can only adopt the spraying process. As a result, the middle white part will have a slight bluish tint, and the pores in the coffee part are not so obvious. In addition, there is a difference in hand feel between the two. Domestic leather feels sandy to the touch, the leather quality is relatively loose, and it is extremely prone to wrinkling; while imported leather is relatively firm.

For Hermès, Himalayan leather represents the top quality. Therefore, if you want to make related products, I strongly recommend using high-quality imported leather.",2,1759029721.0,RepHermes,0,1.0,False

1nsdyrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1nsdyrx/options_drying_up/,Options drying up,"I’m having trouble meeting women, and I feel like I could go on forever about it but I’ll try to keep it concise. I’ve thought critically and come to alot of conclusions but idk if I could just be trapped in some sort of confirmation bias or just a situation that is prone to scarcity. 

First I’ll just tell you the main issue then I’ll describe the variables and scenario I’m actually in. The problem is I’m not meeting women in person that I’m attracted to anywhere. I see them on the street, but never anywhere that I could engage in a conversation and ask them out, or establish some sort of social proof to gain their attention. Dating apps have basically stopped working, and I have my theories about that. 

Irl component: I moved to Philly about a year and a half ago after a bad breakup. It was pretty traumatic because I was involved with a girl who was steeped in drug addiction and psychological problems and ran me through the ringer. I was pretty detached for the first time ever in life after this. Stopped being able to cry which is not like me at all. Before this I had back to back ltr relationships. I’m an artist and I’m well above average in looks, money isnt a problem for me, I work, have savings and never been in debt, have a car whatever I’m like pretty normal. I would meet people with a mix of irl chance meetings and apps. As I get older and have moved a couple times post pandemic, social networks are more difficult to piece together anymore and reliance on apps has grown. Here in Philly I worked in this little shop by myself and couldn’t meet anyone through that at all. Now I work from home so no improvement on that front for social growth. I go to events like this art collective and similar things like that weekly and try to find things on meetup, Eventbrite or the local bar that has an event calendar. Drinking at bars makes me feel shitty and never leads to anything. The events have made me a regular in some small environments but again I just don’t see anyone cute and interesting and single enough at these things. I’ve avowed to fill my calendar even more to expand my social network, but people seem different these days, like socially disjointed. And it really feels like attractive women now have become like legit in hiding. Like they don’t go anywhere except to and from their work school home and grocery store, are there secret clubs they go to to avoid men? because they ain’t at bars and events. I think the general malaise of our culture has led to women changing to a new low of openness. And I’m not going to put out some stupid color pill rhetoric here I think those rhetorics existing at all have become part of a volley of accusation on women and an overwhelm of unfair responsibility and shitty optionality that it’s just like short circuited dating at this point. 

App theory: I was getting matches for about a year after moving here. And going on dates about once a week sometimes. I got laid, had some situationships and was even juggling two at once at one point. None led to that feeling of let me make her my girl. Partly cause of the detached ruin of my soul partly bc these were matches that just didn’t really live up to my standard for that. However recently the apps just stopped giving results, hinge bumble tinder (never worked) coffee meets bagel, Feeld even.. all flatlined at the same time. I know what people will say I had a birthday and it went outside of many people’s age slider, but I’ve tried creating profiles where my age is scaled back a little and not the same results as before, still a radio silence. Maybe they just all got in a meeting were like let’s shadowban this guy. I believe that the apps have been in decline and their gatekeeping gambling addiction tactics are making a lot of people move away from it, but instead of them seeing their stock prices plummet and go hmm maybe we try to act in good faith and let people find matches to regain our reputation they go, no way we are just gonna starve out these people even more, give them no success so they are forced to buy the subscription. But I refuse because I’ve paid before and seen their game and I don’t like it. Paying them does nothing remarkably different. They literally stop you from meeting the right people so you stay addicted with the same intermittent reward system that addicts gamblers.

In conclusion after my casual phase when the apps were still working for that at least, I paused, took stock and returned galvanized to approach finding a real relationship or maybe just move to another city or country where I can have a better chance at meeting a woman who isn’t broken. I’m finding that right now I can’t even find a date. It’s sudden, it’s sad and desolate, and I feel more hopeless than ever before. Idk if there is some desperate frequency I’m putting out, if it’s just that Philly sucks, America, or 2025, is socializing and mating just coming to an end?. Are dating apps and social media ever going to release their destructive grip on the minds and dopaminergic systems of lovers? 

If anyone has insight or similar feelings please share.

I stumbled on the place by chance and then ended up going every weekend because I do really like the coffee there (I've also gone with different friends a couple of those times).

Your curiosity and my terror are stuck together like flesh to bandaid. I'm sure that by the time you read this, I will have shown you over and over how to nurse a bandaid off properly. But I can tell, even now, you’re going to be a bandaid ripper.

That’s the fun of this. I can tell you what I see of you and in you and you’ll understand when you read this. When we talk now, you smile, you toot, you crawl away. But you don’t understand. 

Well, you understand the important things, I guess — that you’re not hungry, not wet, not scared. You’re definitely not scared….

You’re not a lot of things. You'll see that soon enough — you have such beautiful, big, observant eyes. Bright green - not like ours….That’s the bandaid I’m afraid you’ll want to rip off first.

So, I had to beat you to the punch, just so that you don’t go and rip off old scabs with it. I’ll be straight with you. I was far less adventurous than I’m sure you will be and even I wanted to know.

—-

Dear Abila,

I had a favorite ruler as a kid. I used it to doodle.

I don't even know that you could call it doodling, actually, it was just drawing straight lines - one after the other after the other. I need you to know that I was the sort of kid who had a favorite ruler and a love of lines.

One particularly important year, the academy I attended gave the teachers permission to design their own classrooms. Our very young and very fashionable teacher had spent her own dime outfitting her small room with a thrifted vintage white pine table where we would all sit.  Now, in a classroom of gray cubby desks, you get a bottle of Lysol and wipe the desk clean at the end of the year for all the stray little marks and mini masterpieces drawn. But a wooden desk classroom was a bit different. And Miss Pickens realized, of course, that young children, bland as we were, could never appreciate the value of a beautiful, aesthetically pleasing white pine table.

All to say, it was covered with construction paper, so we felt free to draw.

Each piece of paper was a mural of flavor - the two other kids in her class would draw bubble letters and princesses and sheep and anime characters and hands and eyes — so many eyes. But me? Nothing but lines.

I took my favorite ruler and drew one straight line after another after another. So that, at the end of the year when Miss displayed our art, I did not have a beautiful collage to show. I did not have rainbows and gardens or capes or scribbles or that one random pointy s-shape that was everywhere for some reason. Instead, I had made my sheet graphite gray, filling it in one beautiful, perfect line at a time.

Lines gave me peace. They helped me to imagine my life moving in one — straight — perfect — line.

I know how that sounds. But, in my defense, I learned my love of lines.

Mother was a cleaner. I never actually saw her leave the house, I just imagined that was what she did for money. But our home was immaculate, almost clinically pristine. In imitation of her, I once got a report from school saying I was oddly neat. Which is, in and of itself, an odd thought to think, an odd comment to make, and an even odder report to get — but I digress.

Lines are everywhere in a really clean house. They're vacuumed into the carpet, cut into the grass, folded in the closets, pressed into the furniture, stacked on the bookshelf. If I didn't, at once, feel parallel to something, I knew something was off.

Yet, despite our love of lines, there were some, let's say circular, topics in life. For instance, Mother would often remind me that she was not, in fact, my mother.

I'd like to highlight for the record that this was without provocation, not spurred by frustration and overwhelm. Take the first time she told me. I was waiting for the sun to rise, forbidden from leaving my bed before the sun rose (which I realize now is also odd, but as a child who had never been anywhere else at night, I thought it was fairly standard procedure. Every once in a while, I'd comment on a screech of tires and stray light coming from my window at night and ask Mother why people were leaving their beds past bedtime. She brushed these people off as ""no-goods"" which was good enough for me). But I was waiting in bed for the sun to rise because mother would always come and wake me. She walked in in her apron - I never saw her in anything but - and she sat down on my bed. Which was also odd because she never sat on my bed before. She was meant to pick me up and take me to the shower.

Instead, she sat on my bed and said to me, plainly, ""I am not your mother."" Then she got up and left.

I showered myself from that time on. I guess this was my introduction into womanhood? I am not your mother, bathe yourself. But this was not one of those things I could brush off in the tub.

I mean, it seemed plain enough. It was a fact. Facts were always lines. But this was a bad line, which I had not known to exist. It was bad because it had all the trappings of a comfortable line, but it alley-ooped at the end - twisting nauseously into a question. Even worse than a question - an unanswered question. When I asked her over breakfast - a bowl of oatmeal arranged with two rows of almonds and two rows of raspberries - who my mother was, if not her, this was met with silence. A big, fat circle of silence.

I hated circles. Circles bred circles and left little room for much else. She drove me to school as my mind twisted in unnatural ways. Who is my mother? Where is she? Who are you? How did you get me? 

Who am I?

I pressed my hands to my head to try and contain the ever expanding bubbles blowing bigger in my brain. Not Mother slapped my hands away. I was messing my ponytail.

I stuck my finger in the biggest one, the one that had me cringing against the walls of my psyche, to see if I could make it go pop.

""Did you kidnap me,"" I asked. My heart was thrumming, the road ahead blurred by speed and threatening tears.

Mother's brow crumpled and she jutted her lip out, as if trying to understand. She shook her head. ""Non,"" she said. And to my delight, the bubble did pop - lying mercifully dead. I could breathe a little easier and tried for another.

""Is my mother dead?""

""Non.""

""Oh,"" I chuckled, pressing my hand to my chest to calm the flutters in my heart. ""You were only joking this morning.""

""Non,"" she said and slapped my hand away from my heart. I was messing my collar.

I did not have a good day that day. I barely remember it, I was so somewhere else. Miss must have sensed this, and so kindly let me lay my head down as she taught the two other children to play a game in our free period - 21 questions. The crux was that we couldn't ask questions that couldn't be answered with anything other than a yes or no, in order to guess the information.

My sort of game. I hoped it was Not Mother’s sort as well.

""Are you my mother,"" I asked the next morning. I told myself I was only testing, but in truth, I was hoping the answer would have changed. 

""Non,"" she said plainly, breaking my heart over breakfast - that day, a sausage link, an omelet cut in strips, and a dotted line of blueberries served with tea. I scribbled her answer in my notebook under the header, an angular and underlined stick pile of letters - 21 Questions.

""Will you tell me who is my mother?""

""Non,"" she sipped her tea. This was the closest thing to a game we ever played.

""Did my mother give you to me,"" I asked, tremorously.

""Non.""

""Is my real mother nearby?

Silence.

""That's a yes or *non* question,"" I screamed - whatever small version of a scream I was capable of then. She popped me on the mouth. I was messing my rank. ""Why even bring up that you're not my mother,"" I asked. She didn't answer, of course. It wasn't a yes or no question.

""Are we family?""

""Non.""

That day during break, my hands shook as I threw down line after line, desperately methodical. So much so, Miss Pickens and I had to have a little aside about the impressions I was putting into her table.

Much later, perhaps too late, I would have a little aside with Not Mother. She was lying on her bed, unexpectedly ill. She had never been sick before. I had never been in her room before. I glanced around.

It was clean.

""I'm sorry you're dying,"" I said. And I was. I loved her. Still, ""Who are you?""

Her final words to me were these: ""Don't get sad.""

Of course, I did. By then I was seventeen and had begun a bit of a rebellious streak - questioning things I ought not, thinking of things that should be avoided. I was only vacuuming my room twice a week, if you can imagine. I called 911. Then the funeral home. I tried to look very eighteen as they asked about her organs.

Then, the aside; a moment between us where I spoke my peace. Finally.

""You are my mother"" I told her grave, resolutely, ""Who even asked you?"" She was dead and she was my mother because I was choosing so. And that was that.

I got home from burying her and, after flipping through it, I left the ""I'm Dead, Now What? Organizer"" she had provided me lying on the coffee table instead of placed neatly on the shelf.

I ruled the roost, I decided. It is easy to rebel against the dead.

It lay there on the coffee table for fourteen, very itchy minutes. I placed it neatly back on the shelf because I ruled the roost. I decided. And that was that.",1,1759029234.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

I’m a recent grad living in Detroit. I was going to move with my partner to LA when he finished school, but that relationship is no longer. 

I originally always thought I’d prefer NYC, grew up visiting multiple times a year, and am a very blunt person. So people have always kind of associated me with that city.

But I actually lived there during an internship for 3 months and had a really hard time. I love NYC, the city itself is awesome, always something to do, but god was it hard and so lonely and intense. My best friend lives in the city, but otherwise no meaningful relationships there. 

I wanna work in entertainment (hence adamance about nyc/la), and most the people I know from school end up in LA, so I’d have community there. In my industry too. But it’s just never where I saw myself living until recently. Where I’ve been much more team NYC, but previously was hesitant because I thought the city was vapid. Maybe I’m misinformed!

All the online quizzes for LA & NYC are stupid and will determine which city based on if you answer smoothie or black coffee as your cafe order. 

Any advice on how to actually figure out which city you’re more suited for living in??? I’ve visited both and still feel torn!

I can't help but keep feeling like the trajectory of this game has gone too far off it's initial path, and too much is changing.

* I hate that the siblings are now going into the field, the entire reason I chose Wise was because of the man-in-the-chair aspect and I could live out a pathetic Charlies Angels fantasy by sending out a team of female agents to do my dirty work, and while the new format only cements that I made the right choice picking Wise it's not a scenario I want to embrace, **I loved working through Eous**, Bangboo's are adorable and he's basically been relegated to events or that boring platforming minigame they implemented as a result (The fall guys event it started in is fine though).
* I liked the HDD content, **it was far from perfect** and no substitute for an actual physical world to explore (which I'm glad they added), but there were some good instances of it like the classic RPG quest, the Golden Bangboo cash build up one, or that rogue-lite mode they added near the end of 1.XX run at the outpost, and it seems they've completely abandoned the concept rather than trying to fix the problem.
* I miss the coziness of 6th street, they seemed to really invest in wanting the players to get to know each NPC and flush them out, meanwhile I couldn't name a single one at Waifei, I legit refer to them as ""Chinese Dress Shortstack"", ""Wooden Douche"", and ""The Shihtzu"". Every store on 6th street had a functional **individual purpose**, arcade/ramen/bangboo/discs/engines/videostore/coffee, while all of Waifei's are in service to the temple mini-game, or lazy uninspired stalls to carry over the coffee/video so people don't have to go back to 6th St, making Waifei feel less like an inhabited city block and more like a empty world hub.
* Along with that they seem to have abandoned trying to come up with new arcade games for god finger, which was basically the only form of co-op/multiplayer the game had outside of the previously listed Fall Guys event.
* I despise the downgrade in titles, we went from ""Master Proxies"" Phaethon infamous white-hat criminals of the inter-knot to **Junior**'s Wise/Belle hired help at a rundown temple by incompetent monks, and personal gofers of an unseen mayor.
* And to add insult to injury, they double down on us being reduced to a lacky by sticking us in a gaudy-ass uniform that **despite being customizable shows none of the cosmetics in story mode** or character interactions, I get that it would be ridiculous to expect them to appear in pre-rendered cutscenes or illustrated splash pages, but seriously, you can't find a way to put them into the conversation scenes that are literally using the in-game models??
* Then, the worst offence you can commit in a gacha game, I've felt nothing for any of the designs since Mockingbird came onto the scene and that Vampire douche ruined the unbroken winning streak ZZZ was having with male designs, aside from those 2 blemishes **there wasn't a single 1.XX character I didn't immediately want to pull on**, but now...

1. I find the monks bland and rehashes of Ben/Nekomata, and only pulled Yixuan because of her tits and her being a new class.
2. I think the spook house girls were **purposely given bland designs** to motivate players to buy their swimsuits, and the cat(?) guy looks ridiculous and belongs in some bara bara chest yaoi manga.
3. I Legitimately hate EVERYTHING about Olphie and **the tail**, while not batting an eye at either Seed.
4. I feel nothing for Lucia (neither redesign nor original), while I haven't seen enough of the blonde wielding the hammer(?) to peak my interest
5. The pop(?) group that leaked over a year ago, and had 1 member show up in the summer patch just doesn't do anything for me, especially that medabots rip-off android one.
6. And the rabbit...if somehow some twisted chaos god floating out in the inky abyss of space decides that those **rumors** are to be true and makes it a reality that that cotton tailed puffball is the **void hunter** for the 2.XX run... I-I don't know what to say...

* I can't stand **miasmic shields** it's an artificial difficulty hurdle only implemented to combat the raise in the damage ceiling new characters have introduced, and already turns the **tedious stagger gauge system** into a bigger time sink, rendering many older characters completely useless. It was fine when it was just one or two bosses and had a reason to it story-wise, but now every single new boss can do it **even when outside miasma areas**
* And this is entirely on me, it may have been addressed in later external media, but I can't remember the last time Faerie was important to the plot, they seem to just be sitting on the character relegating it literally just being a personal assistant **which was only supposed to be a cover**, when this is supposed to be a revolutionary AI and part of a mysterious quartet of super AI's and a much deeper plot.

I think **the story is still good** and I'm eager to see how it unfolds, and **I'm happy actual hollow exploration has been introduced** (even though it was stuttery as hell on release and being able to swap out characters at any point is immersion breaking), but all this other stuff adding together is just making it harderer and harder to engage.  
I couldn't be bothered to even pick up and play this most recent patches story quest or events until the last day of Seeds banner run, and was more motivated to just get it **done and over with** than anything else, which sucks cause I liked Seeds story.",0,1759028988.0,ZZZ_Official,1,0.1,False

I found Treet Platinum blades on Amazon for $7 for 100. One blade = $0.07.

Good old AquaVelva 3.5oz aftershave was $3.33 at Walmart. I used about 1/8th in 7d. $0.19

I used my Yardley almond and oatmeal shower nubs in the shaving cup. $0

The brush is just a generic synthetic for $3 online. It's lasted months but we can say $0.25 a week for 12 weeks.

I found two razors for $18 on eBay. A Gillette SuperSpeed and a Schick Krona 1966. With delivery the Krona was $11.

My experience with The Blades Grim pre-shave oil was great. I found a bottle of food-grade Equate mineral oil for $2.50 at Walmart, 16oz. 7 shaves at .25oz per shave, (includes a few drops in the shaving soap) = $0.20.

Disposable twin blades at Walmart, $1/5. One razor = $0.20.

Krona $11/52 wks= $0.21
Any coffee mug = $1/52 = $0.02
Treet DE blade = $0.07
AquaVelva = $0.19
Brush use = $0.25
Mineral oil pre-shave = $0.20
Disposable twin ATG = $0.20.

49+65= $ 1.14 for 7 shaves.
Or $0.16 per shave.

I added oil to my face and cream cup and stirred up the lather while the water heated. 

I used a washcloth to warm my face between passes. 

I made 3 passes with the Krona WTG, and one pass ATG with the disposable twin. 

A few drops of AV wrapped it up.

1nsdr3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colognes/comments/1nsdr3c/review_brief_notes_of_50_fragrances/,"Review, Brief Notes of 50+ fragrances","For context, I began my fragrance journey roughly three (3) years ago when I finished college and began working an office job. With that, most of these experiences or memories are recent, though I acknowledge that some of these may have been reformulated or reworked.

I am currently 27(M) and married - most of my fragrance journey has involved looking for things that I like, not fragrances that are described as chick magnets. During my journey, I have found that I -

* Generally like the more mass-appealing, more simplistic fragrances. This typically means I am drawn to more design fragrances than niche fragrances;
* Stay away from overly sweet and/or youthful fragrances;
* Gravitate towards more bright, citrusy, or spicy fragrances more than I do the gourmands, leathers, or boozy; and
* Am not opposed to owning dupes or ""inspired by"" fragrances, especially those recreating exceptionally expensive fragrances. I think everyone should have access to great smelling fragrances, and if a fragrance house can do that for significantly less, count me in.

A majority of these fragrances I have owned in some capacity (full bottles or decants). None of the fragrances listed are fragrances that I wore or sampled at a department store (no one-and-dones). As mentioned, I have been at this for about three years, tracking fragrances I have tried along the way. With this, there may be some overlap or even conflicting ratings.

By no means is this meant to negatively affect anyone's feelings, opinions, or their views of their own collection. Fragrances are so subjective; wear what you like (or in my case, wear what you & your significant other like).

I’ve been at this coffee shop for almost a month — it’s my fave spot in town, I used to study there all the time, so I was super excited when the boss hired me on the spot. He seemed chill and nice at first.

But omg, since day one, he’s been watching my every move and commenting on literally everything I do. On my first shift, I worked basically alone for 4 hours during what he called the busiest Saturday of the summer. He was like ""you might think I'm not watching you but I see everything you do"". Then at the end, he gave me this whole speech like, “You gotta catch up and match our rhythm or you won’t like the job"". Like, dude, you’ve been here for 3 years, I’ve been here for 4 hours lol. I have barista experience but every place is different — I still gotta learn where stuff is and the whole menu.

Since then, it’s like nothing I do is right. He’s always watching me and finding little things to correct, stuff that honestly doesn’t even matter. He also corrects me on stuff that I didn't even do (I hate blaming others, even when it's not my fault, but it gets annoyting after a while). He gets frustrated when I don’t know how to do something but like… he never actually showed me? Sometimes I’m just walking to grab a towel or whatever and he’s like, “Uh, what are you doing?” Like mind your own business for 2 minutes please??

My ego is way too big to quit right now. I just feel like I *need* to prove him wrong, even if it’s draining as hell. Today was so exhausting, and honestly, I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this.

The old lamplight in the study flickered, casting long, dancing shadows that made the familiar room feel foreign. Outside, a late autumn storm raged, rattling the windows like a frantic beggar. I sat at my desk, a cup of lukewarm tea beside a stack of musty historical texts, but my eyes were fixed not on my research, but on a single, unsettling object: an old, leather-bound **ledger**.

It had appeared on my doorstep a week ago, without a note or a sender's address. It was heavy, and the leather felt disturbingly like a dry, shriveled skin. Curiosity, a vice that had always been my greatest strength and most dangerous weakness, had compelled me to open it. Inside, the pages were thick and yellowed, filled with a spidery, incomprehensible **script**. It was the handwriting of a madman, or something far worse.

I had tried to make sense of the gibberish, to find a pattern or a meaning in the chaotic scrawl. My work as a historian had always been about deciphering the past, but this was a language of pure nonsense, a testament to a mind that saw the world in a way I never could. I was about to close the book and throw it into the fireplace when I noticed it. A single page, different from the rest.

This page was not filled with the swirling madness of the alien script. It was a list, a terrifyingly simple **list of names**. My fingers trembled as I traced the familiar letters of my own tongue. The names were all people I knew, neighbors from my quiet suburban street, fellow historians from the local university, even the woman who ran the small cafe where I got my morning coffee. **The clock has no hands, but the time is known.**

A cold, creeping **dread** began to slither up my spine. This was a list of real people. A list of the living. I tried to dismiss it as a morbid joke, a prank by some twisted individual. But the feeling of the ledger in my hands, its unnatural weight and texture, made a joke seem impossible. This was something real. Something wrong.

And then I saw it. The most recent entry on the list, scrawled with a different kind of ink, a substance that seemed to absorb the light rather than reflect it. It was thick and viscous, with a sheen that was both greasy and unsettlingly bright. It was my name, **Elias Thorne**, written in a dark, clotted substance that looked and felt disturbingly like blood, but wasn't. It was **ichor**.

The sight of my name, scrawled in ichor on the list of those marked for **abduction**, was a visceral blow. The word 'abduction' was not written, but the horrifying implication was so clear it might as well have been. The other names on the list were people who had vanished without a trace in the past few months. Their disappearances had been attributed to everything from mysterious illnesses to impulsive vacations, but the truth, I now realized, was far more sinister. **The harvest is nigh.**

My mind raced, trying to find a logical explanation. A ritual? A cult? But the ledger felt older than any human belief. The language, the material, the very aura of the thing spoke of a power that was not of this Earth. This was not a human plot. This was an **extraterrestrial entity**, a cosmic horror, and the ledger was its logbook, a chilling record of its acquisitions.

I stood up, the old chair scraping against the hardwood floor. The dread was no longer a slithering thing, but a suffocating blanket. The storm outside seemed to howl in unison with the terror in my soul. I was on a list. And the thing that made the list was coming for me. It was not a matter of if, but of when. **The key is not where it seems.**

I looked at my desk, at the books and the laptop. The tools of a rational man, a man of science and history. They suddenly felt so small, so utterly useless against the cosmic dread that now filled the room. How could a man armed with logic and reason fight an entity that used ichor to write its ledger?

I thought of running, of calling the police, of shouting my discovery from the rooftops. But who would believe me? Who would listen to a frantic man babbling about an alien ledger and a list of the disappeared? They would lock me away, or worse, they would think I was part of the conspiracy. The truth, in this case, was more dangerous than any lie.

I was **alone**. Alone with the terrible knowledge that my time was limited, that my life was now just a line on a horrifying grocery list. The names scrawled above mine, those who had already gone, were a testament to the inescapable nature of my fate. There was **no escape**.

I felt a new kind of terror. Not of death, but of what came after. The list said ""abduction."" Not ""execution"" or ""annihilation."" What did an alien entity do with the humans it collected? What horrors lay beyond the threshold of its grasp? Was it a farm? A zoo? A laboratory? **The stars bleed crimson for a reason.**

I walked to the window, the thunder a low growl in the distance. The streetlights flickered in the storm, casting an eerie glow on the empty street. I saw a movement in the shadows, a fleeting glimpse of something that shouldn't be there, a shape that was too tall, too thin, too fluid to be human.

My breath hitched in my throat. It was **here**. The collector of names, the author of the list. It was a wraith, a shadow, a thing of pure terror. It was not bound by the storm, or the physical world. It was simply there, a silent, patient hunter.

I backed away from the window, my hands trembling. The ledger was still on the desk, its pages open to my name. The ichor seemed to pulse, a living, breathing thing. It was a beacon, a signal, a final, chilling **invitation**. **The last to know is always the first to go.**

The lights in the study flickered and died. The room was plunged into utter darkness, save for the faint, sickly glow of the ichor on the ledger page. In the sudden silence, I heard it. A faint scraping sound on the other side of the door. The sound of something impossibly long and thin, like a razor blade on old wood.

The dread became a primal, animalistic fear. It was no longer a realization; it was a **reality**. The sight of my name, scrawled in ichor on the list of those marked for abduction, was not a warning. It was a **summons**. And I had no choice but to answer.",1,1759028469.0,ldritchTales,0,1.0,False

Over the past three months, my authority has been systematically undermined. My company purchasing card was revoked, I am salaried but now required to clock in and out, my check-writing and security camera access have been removed, and the owner has stopped communicating with me. Despite these changes, my job title and salary have remained the same.

Yesterday, I learned that our most recent hire, Joe, has been telling another employee, Frank, that I'm being accused of embezzling $800 per month for the past 12 years to fund a personal website. This is a false and easily disprovable accusation. Frank has since shared this false information with two other employees.

I've also discovered that the owner has been discussing these false accusations with the owners of our local coffee shop. As this is a small town where I am well-known, this is severely damaging to my reputation.

This is a clear case of slander. The owner has not only undermined my professional authority but also is spreading defamatory lies to employees and members of the community. Is this actionable? I'm ready to leave this job, but I'm furious about the personal and professional damage being done.

I have decided that social media sucks and I am just completely breaking away. Uninstalling it all  tonight, facebook too.","A good rule in life is, If anything is that much of a hassle just don't use it. I like linux  but no one is making you use it. You don't like it? More power to you. Use something else

  
Linux is linux, it isn't supposed to be for everyone. Some people run around trying to sell it. I see posts in here an other reddit threads talking about ""what linux needs to do to be more popular"" so it can attract ""the casual user"".  That is just . . . stupid, because casual users don't belong here. That isn't gate keeping, it is just the reality of what Linux is. If you choose to use it as your desktop you have to be a little bit insane lol.  I have been since november 12th, 2010. It doesn't need to do or change anything, because the linux community . . . we aren't trying to compete . . .well, most of us don't give a shit lol. 

  
Windows and Mac are fine, use them if they work better for you. They are highly polished highly opinionated setups and they really do . . . ""just work"", they are also commercial and do their best to provide you with everything you need to use your system with as little learning as possible. If you are using windows or mac, you might be really good on your system, you might be great on computers, but you don't have to be. You can get by without being an expert. You can be an extremely casual user. How do you setup a printer on windows? Plug it in? isn't that about right? 

  
Linux . . . it simply doesn't work that way. It isn't commercial  . . . and that changes more than most people are willing to really sit back and consider. The commercial compainies have a pretty consistent unified vision. I have been to a couple of these massive corporate buildings. Apple headquarters near Santa Cruise . . . i foget the name of the town, Coopertino? something like that . . . its a great big flipping circle, and i mean BIG in the middle of a manicured forested town, fancy, kind of pretty . . . hell, the pixar offices in Silicon Valley . . .massive. Linux is being developed by random people in garages and home offices and coffee shops all around the world. There isn't one singular opinionated idea . . . it is fractured, with ""lots of different ways"" to do things, and it is beatiful . . .

  
but it isn't for the faint of heart. RTFM is the best advice you can get if you intend to keep using Linux. It isn't gatekeeping, or being an elitist. You really have to do it though. If you think you will survive with copy and paste and google searches and AI you are going to spend a lot more time in the end then if you just read teh fuckin manual to begin with.  You will NOT be catered to by a giant corporation. Your box, your choices . . . YOUR responsibility. Now, the community will help you, if you put an honest effort in . . . but there is no ""customer service"", because there are no ""customers"".

We’re leaving North Van because we’re tired of the bridge and want something a little less “cookie-cutter.” We’re looking for more interesting coffee shops, bars, and general character.

At first, we were pretty drawn to Mount Pleasant (around E 10th). But after viewing a few places up the street (near the Biltmore) — and after getting some crime intel on the area from a VPD officer — I’m feeling less inclined to move there.

We also looked at Olympic Village but have heard (and read here) some concerning things about the nearby SROs and associated crime. I’ve also read that many of the buildings were rushed for the Olympics and can have issues with plumbing/sewage systems.

That’s led me to start looking more seriously at Fairview — specifically the area between Burrard and Cambie, leaning closer to Cambie.

I’ve lived on the North Shore (Lower Lonsdale) for the past seven years, so although I travel to these areas on occasion, I’m not super familiar with these neighbourhoods. I’d love to hear your opinions on Mount Pleasant, Olympic Village, and Fairview — or if you think there’s another area we should be considering.

I know that crime — to some extent — is unavoidable, but I’m hoping to strike a balance between having a vibrant, interesting neighbourhood, feeling reasonably safe, and still having plenty of cafés, restaurants, and everyday essentials within easy walking distance.",1,1759027791.0,askvan,4,0.67,False

 If any of this catches your attention feel free to write me! If you don’t believe in a woman’s right to choose then I’m not the man for you. ",1,1759027581.0,R4R30Plus,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

In the early days I thought the cups were more dynamic, lively, and complex compared to my 078 cups, which I have used daily for a year. To make sure if that's the case, I decided to do some blind taste test with the Deep 27, keeping the brew time very close. I thought the difference would be marginal or I wouldn't be able to tell which is which. However, the result is striking: in 2 tests with 2 different coffees, I preferred the M01 cups without hesitation, from hot to room temp. This is surely not a perfect way and long-enough period to compare 2 grinders but considering my earlier judgment after several series of brews, this only confirms what I thought. Now I can see why a member here (Impossible Cow) said 6 out 7 prefer M01 over 078 too in a blind tasting.

So, I’ve been feeling a little sluggish lately. Anyone else? 😴 It’s that time of year where the days get darker earlier, and all I want to do is curl up on the couch with a movie (or maybe a nap... okay, definitely a nap). But let’s be real – who wants to feel tired all the time, especially after 50? 

I was chatting with some friends and we realized that there *are* ways to boost our energy that don’t involve downing cups of coffee or binge-watching our favorite shows until we zonk out. I mean, how about we channel that energy into something more exciting? Here’s what I found that’s helped me:

### 1. **Get Moving** 🕺
I know, I know. The last thing you want to do is jump into an intense workout, but hear me out. 
- A brisk 10-minute walk can work wonders. The fresh air practically yells “Wake up!” 
- Try some light stretching or yoga – you’ll feel like a brand-new person. Seriously, who wouldn’t want to feel rejuvenated?

### 2. **Time Your Meals** 🍽️
Let’s talk snacks. 
- Instead of sugary snacks that might make you crash harder than a toddler after a sugar rush, opt for protein-packed options. Think nuts, yogurt, or even some cheese.
- Have you tried eating smaller, more frequent meals? Keeps that energy stable, folks!

### 3. **Stay Hydrated** 💧
Alright, we’ve all heard this one a million times, but it’s for a reason: dehydration = sluggishness. 
- Aim for at least 8 glasses a day, and if plain water bores you, spice it up! Infuse it with fruits or herbs. Hello, fancy hydration!

### 4. **Snooze Smart** 😴
I’m not telling you to ditch naps altogether (because… naps), but how about limiting them? 
- A quick power nap of 20–30 minutes can actually recharge you. Longer than that and you might wake up feeling like a zombie. 

### 5. **Connect with Others** 🤝
We are social creatures, and a good chat or laugh can do wonders for your mood and energy. 
- Whether it’s an old friend or a family member, don’t underestimate the power of a good conversation! Have you ever noticed how talking with someone lifts your mood? 

These little shifts can really make a difference and breathe some new life into our days! Oh, and speaking of strong people, you can check out this cool community that believes in the *strongest people* and how we can boost our lives together: [We believe in strongest people.](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb).

Igarish Shnoswenkl

Character Overview

Race: Tabaxi–Goblin hybrid

Age: 20 (young adult)

Height: 1.5 feet tall

Build: Small, pot-bellied, digitigrade legs

Skin/Hair: Pale light-green skin, wiry orange mohawk

Voice: Raspy, feline-like

Alignment: Chaotic Neutral (leans toward good)


Appearance

Igarish is extraordinarily, almost comically, ugly — a jumble of features that don’t quite fit together. He has a catlike mouth, goblin-like eyes, and a nose that makes no anatomical sense. His head is crowned with a wiry orange mohawk, and his pale green skin stretches over a small, round, pot-bellied frame. His digitigrade, catlike legs keep his heels lifted, giving him an odd, animalistic stance.

Despite his awkward body, Igarish carries himself with an excitable energy that makes him oddly endearing, even if unsettling at first glance.


Backstory

Igarish was born in Baldur’s Gate to loving parents — a tabaxi mother (Mrs. Shnoswenkl) and goblin father (Mr. Shnoswenkl) — who ran a bakery and coffee shop called Winkie’s Bakery and Coffee Shop. Though surprised by their son’s unusual appearance, they were endlessly devoted to him and worked hard to raise him with love.

Growing up, Igarish expressed a love for engineering. His parents, supportive despite their modest means, even saved money to send him to school so he could study to become an engineer. He graduated successfully, but instead of pursuing steady work, he chose a chaotic path: inventing weapons and gadgets, much to his parents’ dismay.

Though they disapprove of his choice (especially his experiments with explosives), they still let him use a shed in the back as his personal workshop. There, Igarish has been tinkering constantly, creating dangerous but inventive contraptions — his pride and joy being a prototype hand cannon. He now seeks adventure, both as an excuse to test his inventions and to prove his genius to the world.


Personality

Igarish is brilliant but reckless, awkward yet oddly charming in his own eccentric way. He has a good heart, though he hides it under bravado. Endlessly excitable, he throws himself into his inventions with wild energy, even when they’re unstable or unfinished.


Strengths

Smart, college-educated

Naturally inventive and creative

Good at baking

Eccentric mind fuels his ideas


Weaknesses

Deeply sensitive about his looks and height

Socially awkward, especially around women

Can’t hold his liquor

Impulsive and reckless in his tinkering

Inventions are unpredictable and prone to misfire or explode


Quirks & Traits

Alignment: Chaotic Neutral (leans good)

Overconfident in his inventions

Excitable, eager to prove himself

Hides a genuinely kind heart under bravado


Likes & Dislikes

Likes: Inventing, puzzles, women (sometimes a creep), explosives, pumpkin pie
Dislikes: Comments about his appearance, swimming, the color green, boring conversations


Current Invention

Igarish’s pride and joy is his prototype hand cannon — a handheld weapon modeled after a traditional cannon. It fires small forged cannonballs powered by tweaked black powder, which is far more volatile than usual. In small bags, the powder can even be used as makeshift bombs.

Though it is still very much a work in progress — unpredictable, unstable, and prone to misfire or outright explosion — Igarish is constantly looking for excuses to test it.

1nscrrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/furnaces/comments/1nscrrl/mr_incredible_yourrere_fired_for_pouring_radium/,"Mr. Incredible, your're're fired for pouring Radium in my coffee!","It was a fucking 8 foot tall Deluxe double patty bacon cheeseburger. With raw hamburger meat legs, and French fry teeth. ""Dear god Capitalist, what did you DO!?"" I yelled over the sound of splintering wood and shattering glass as i took cover behind an overturned table and drew my shotgun. Eldrich and Pirate did the same. 

""The hell are we gonna do!?"" i shouted over to them before sending some buckshot in the Burger's direction. I got to keep that thing distracted! That youngster that i never got the name of is the only one here without a weapon! 

That same youngster was slowly backing up on his backside towards the wall as the giant burger tried munching on Capitalist. ""Everything is fi-"" Capitalist shouted over the noise before being sent out the nearest window by the burger. American was still screaming over his arm being missing, and Gool who at this point has held out surprisingly well, looked like he had some internal damage and was starting to slow down. He was NOT gonna last much longer. 

Suddenly, Pirate Air conditioner drew a flintlock and fired. the shot missed completely and buried itself in American's leg. ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA F\*CK!!!"" Screamed American as pain suddenly filled him from two directions. ""I hope you don't use a musket for home defense too Pirate,"" snickered Eldrich despite the situation. ""what you need is some magic in your life. Like this!"" He stood up, and suddenly there was silence. 

It was heard from all directions, felt like it was coming out of the fabric of reality itself. one word. ""FIREBALL!"" A sphere of blue fire flew from out of nowhere and enveloped the burger in flame. The roar that came out of that thing could make me vomit again if i wasn't already empty. ""Well, that should do it."" Smiled Eldrich as he approached the now still monster that was still burning. He turned around with a triumphant look on his face. and for a moment we all breathed a sigh of relief. except American. For all we knew American was dead or dying. 

And then the monster got up. All of your faces went white, as the monster rose back on its feet, which were now medium rare, and focused its sesame seed eyes on Eldrich who was oblivious to the situation. 

\*\*CHOMP.\*\* not even a scream. just the wet sounds of squishing, tearing metal. like a tin can full of tomato being crushed. Eldrich's lower half fell it its knees. there was no upper half anymore. I think i crapped myself. not before seeing a table fly up and hit me in the face. 

The battle resumed with me hitting the far wall, and everything went fuzzy. Pirate had picked up my shotgun had had begun unloading into the bun, while Gool continued his revolver fire. Everyone was running low on ammunition, and we are all but fallen. Except for Edrich. he was probably dead. I can't see American either. He had his eyes closed, hand on the stump that was his arm. That youngster was nowhere to be found, Gool was fortified behind a table, and Pirate AC was fortified behind another.

1nscrld,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1nscrld/day_4_post_op_feeling_back_to_normal_except_for/,Day 4 - Post Op (feeling back to normal except for gas),"I took a shower yesterday and today. I went to a mini concert just 3 minutes away from home with my husband and my daughter. I cooked food. I did some cleaning without lifting anything heavy. 

No more pain. Shoulder pain? Zero. Abdominal pain? Zero. 

No dizziness. No nausea. 

I'm still on a very low fat diet though. I haven't tried coffee or fried food in large or normal amounts.

Here are some foods/drinks that I tried in very small amounts (these are things I avoided while waiting for my surgery):
- cheese (1/2 teaspoon of parmesan)
- fried chicken (1 bite)
- choco chip cookie (1 piece)

And I felt fine.

I have 1 problem for now:
- my stomach still feels big
- there are times my stomach feels heavy and hard

But my incisions look normal, well, I expected them to look like this it's just the 4th day! They look and feel perfectly fine. 

I'm still waiting for my ERCP.

Same with the Space Dresser; I honestly hate the random orange furniture and I think the dresser would tie it in with the rest of the blue/purple tones of the theme! It’d be awesome if they could be a quest reward, or popped onto a wheel or something. 

I know there are tons of other cool items in the game I don’t even know about, so I’m super excited to hear people’s opinions on this!",3,1759025700.0,Webkinz,4,1.0,False
