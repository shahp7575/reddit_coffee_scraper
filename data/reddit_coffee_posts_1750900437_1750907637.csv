I can't take off my hijab at school anymore because it's a big uni and there's too many people from the community that know me and think I'm a hijabi.

I also see how many of my female family members are able to make friends with all the other muslim girls, I have no friends. I make friends with non muslims and I am not allowed to hang out with them, so I only see them at school and often end up in friendships where it's just a result of having class with the person. Most people are not interested if the friendship can't go past that.

I also don't connect with muslim girls, I tried but she was constantly ranting about Islam and I just didn't want to hear it so I distanced myself.  Being friends with muslims often means they will give you islamic ""advice"" or want to try to make each other better muslims which I am not interested in.

I also don't make friends with muslims because in the future when i take off my hijab and marry a non muslim guy and do all these things, they'd find out at some point and we would just stop being friends. They are nice now but if they find out you went down this path they would switch up so I see no reason in trying to build a community of friendships that I know I'm going to lose.

I have to ask my parents permission for the dumbest things, just to go get coffee with a friend, I feel ugly in modest clothing and hijab. I don't waste too much money on clothing because I can't buy the stuff I want and I don't really like islamically modest outfits on me.

Whenever I do go out, it's never what I want to do because my parents are texting and calling and checking my location. I always end up going to the mall or going out to eat, and its never with someone i truly enjoy being around because I can only go out with the very few people my parents approve of. I cannot travel with friends, I cant go further than the city, I cant go to the gym alone or with friends, I cant do activities at their house.

Im still in college and no part time job will allow for me to move out in this economy. all the money will go to rent and i cant go out anyway cause theres no money to. I want to study abroad for a semester but what will happen when I come back? This is so tiring.

  
I also get jealous of my cousins because their parents allowed them to dorm in college, study abroad, travel, have friends, didn't force them to wear hijab. I wish my mom didn't choose my dad, she didnt even wear a hijab until she was in her 30s. If she married someone else this would be so much easier.",2,1750907127.0,exmuslim,1,1.0,False

My child turns 3 this Saturday, and a myriad of life circumstances have left us without any plans in the world for her big day. A few weeks ago, we imagined a backyard party at our house, but then had some landscaping/outdoor issues that rendered our space a poor choice for that type of gathering. Then, I was laid off from my job of 6 years, and my brain semi-imploded for a while, leaving my executive functioning in shambles and unable to be cheerful enough to plan something fun. Now her birthday is in just a few days, and even though she's young enough that she's not going to necessarily remember a lackluster birthday, I'd still like to do some fun things with her, my husband, and her almost-5-year-old brother to celebrate the occasion. On weekends, we typically will do any combination of farmer's market, bike riding, coffee shop, outdoor play, maybe zoo/aquarium/nature center. We are in a midwest city with plenty of fun things to do.

[Part 1]","Have you ever been to a college town in the summer? It feels like the rapture happened overnight. One minute the streets are filled with graduates eager to start their vacation, the next they‚Äôre lifeless and empty. As a newcomer in this area, the silence is incredibly lonesome.

Don't get me wrong, the town itself is fine. It's one of those classic university communities where half the population turns over every semester and the other half has been here since the 1960s. Coffee shops on every corner, bookstores that smell like old paper and water damage, and so many bars that it makes you question how they can all stay in business at the same time. The kind of place that looks perfect in college brochures.

I can‚Äôt complain, especially since my mom agreed to cover my stay here if I promised to keep my GPA up. In fact, she was ecstatic when I proposed moving halfway across the country. Which, to be honest, was a bit of a surprise. Growing up, she‚Äôd always been more on the overprotective side. Constantly keeping track of my location and always checking the locks twice before we went to bed. To her credit, we‚Äôd had a pretty bad break-in when I was four years old. It messed her up for quite a while, but I was too young to remember much of what happened. Whenever I try to think about that night, it‚Äôs just distant, fuzzy images of the police dragging someone out of my bedroom and throwing them into a cop car.

The problem isn‚Äôt the town, the problem is me. Or more specifically, how hard it is for me to make friends.

Back home, I had a close knit group. Most of us had known each other since elementary school and spent every free second we had together. Nearly a decade of inside jokes, backyard concerts and video game tournaments had come to an end this summer. Now everyone's scattered across different states, different time zones. We try to stay in touch through group chats and video calls, but it's not the same. Jake's busy with his engineering program, Marcus is working two jobs to pay for school, and Sarah's three hours ahead on the East Coast. By the time I'm free to hang out, they're already asleep, studying or living their new lives without me.

Most days, the only person I actually talk to face-to-face is Bill, my mailman.

Bill's in his fifties and sports a pair of massive blue sunglasses that take up half of his face. He wears them every single day regardless of weather. His skin looks as though he was a surfer, leathery and thick after years of direct sun. Either that or he needed to cutback on the spray tans. He's friendly enough though, always asks how I'm settling in, if I need anything, the kind of small talk that makes you feel less invisible.

""Another package for you today."" Bill handed me the box, his massive sunglasses reflecting my disheveled appearance. ""You sure do order a lot of stuff online.""

""Easier than figuring out where all the stores are,"" I told him, which was partially true. The real truth was that ordering things online meant I had something to look forward to, even if it was just a new webcam I'd impulse-bought at 2 AM.

""I get it. If you ever need someone to show you around, just let me know."" His smile was genuine, and for a moment my loneliness subsided. If only for a moment. When your mailman is the closest thing you have to a regular social interaction, you know you're in trouble.

That's probably why I started streaming.

It seemed like the perfect solution for an introvert like myself. I could connect with people without having to navigate the awkward social dynamics of college parties or trying to insert myself into established friend groups.

My setup was pretty basic. A decent webcam, a microphone that didn't sound too terrible, and my gaming PC positioned so my bed wasn't visible in the background. I had to keep an air of professionalism somehow. I even bought a few LED strips to finish off my ‚ÄòCliche Streamer Starter Kit.‚Äô

For the first two weeks, my viewer count stayed at a solid zero. Occasionally someone would pop in, maybe say ""hi"" in chat, then disappear after a minute or two. I tried different games, different times of day, nothing seemed to work. I couldn‚Äôt help but think that at a certain point, I had gone from streaming to genuinely just talking to myself.

But I kept at it.

It was during this time that I started noticing small things around my apartment that seemed... wrong. Nothing dramatic, just tiny details that made me question my own memory. I'd leave a coffee mug on my desk and find it in the kitchen sink later‚Äîclean but still slightly warm, like it had been recently washed. Books on my shelf would be arranged differently. Nothing wildly out of order, just shifted enough that the spines didn't line up the way I remembered leaving them.

At first I chalked it up to stress. Moving to a new place, being isolated, spending too much time alone. My brain was playing tricks on me. Everyone misplaces things.

Then last week, something changed with my streams. I went live around 9 PM like usual, ready for another night of incessantly talking to myself while playing some indie horror game I'd picked up on sale. After about 20 minutes of radio silence, my viewer count showed 1 instead of 0.

Someone was actually watching.

I tried to play it cool, didn't want to scare them off by being too eager. ""Hey there, welcome to the stream,"" I said, trying to sound natural. ""Thanks for hanging out with me tonight.""

The viewer didn't say anything in chat. No introduction, no emoticons, nothing. But they stayed. For the entire two-hour stream, that little ""1"" never moved. Someone was genuinely watching me play, listening to me ramble about game mechanics and random thoughts that popped into my head.

It should have felt good. Finally, after weeks of streaming to an empty room, I had a viewer. But something about it made me uncomfortable. Maybe it was the complete silence on their end. I know it‚Äôs normal for someone to watch a stream passively, but I can‚Äôt shake the uncanny feeling that I was being‚Ä¶ observed.

Right before I was about to end the stream and log off for the night, a message finally appeared in chat.

**wx11flow3r\_75:**¬†‚ÄúI love watching you...‚Äù

Before I could respond, they left. The viewer count dropped back to 0, and I was left alone in my apartment again.

That night, I heard something in the walls behind my head.

I was lying in bed, scrolling through my phone and trying to wind down, when I heard a faint scratching sound. I wanted to believe it was just the building settling, but something about the noise felt purposeful. Like fingernails dragging slowly across wood.

The sound seemed to move around me toward the wall where my computer setup was. I followed it, crouching down under my desk to get closer to the baseboard. Whatever it was, it stopped moving. That's when I noticed a small hole in the wall. Fresh wood shavings littered the baseboard below it‚Äîthis wasn't here yesterday. It was barely visible, maybe half an inch wide with cracks spider-webbing outward behind my computer.

As I leaned closer to examine it, I felt a strange temperature change wash over me. A warm blast of air brushed against my skin before returning to normal. I leaned even closer. The scratching stopped.

Peering into the small hole, I saw the glossy shine of an eye staring back at me. It was pure black and unmoving. My muscles tensed as my body entered a state of fight-or-flight. I hurled myself backward out of instinct and let out a stifled scream. As I landed on the ground, I heard the scratching begin again, even more frantic. But this time, the scratching was accompanied by another sound: Squeaking.

*Jesus Christ, it was just a rat?*¬†I thought, as I sighed a long breath of equal relief and frustration. Of course it was a rat. This is an old building and the summer heat drives them inside. I'd dealt with mice in my bedroom growing up. This was essentially the same thing, just bigger.

I spent the rest of the night convincing myself there was nothing supernatural happening in my apartment, tossing and turning feverishly as the scratches intermittently returned.

Days passed without much excitement. I streamed every night and without fail, ‚Äò**wx11flow3r\_75**‚Äô was there. At least, I had to assume it was them. Even though a message rarely ever popped up in chat, my viewer count never wavered from 1. At times it felt voyeuristic, but in a way, I guess that‚Äôs the appeal of live streams. I grew to enjoy the company of that number ‚Äú1‚Äù some nights, knowing that at least someone was there with me.

Two days ago I ended my stream a little early to the disappointment of my ‚Äòfaithful viewer‚Äô.

‚ÄúAlright guys, I‚Äôm gonna end it here for the night. I have to clean up my place a little bit before bed, it‚Äôs a fucking mess.‚Äù I said, taking off my headphones and closing out of the game as I looked around the disheveled work station.

Just as I clicked ‚ÄòEnd Stream‚Äô, a message in the chat appeared.

**wx11flow3r\_75:**¬†‚Äòno, please! I barely get to see you anymore.‚Äô

I didn‚Äôt have time to respond before the live stream cut out. I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve even known how to respond. What could they have meant by barely got to see me anymore? I shook it off and stuck to my plan of tidying up the apartment. I loaded up empty cans of energy drinks and Styrofoam boxes of leftover fast food into a trash bag and made my way to the dumpsters.

As I walked around to the back of the building, I spotted movement in one of the second floor windows. I probably should have minded my own business, kept walking, thrown away my garbage and gone back inside. But something compelled me to stop and look.

It was a girl‚Äîroughly my age‚Äîwith dark red hair pulled back in a loose ponytail. She was in what looked like her bedroom, pulling off a paint splattered t-shirt and replacing it with a rather tight fitting sweater. The back light of her bedroom hugged the curves of her skin, making it seem like her form was glowing. For just a moment I stood there, gazing at her through the window. She moved around her room with effortless grace, completely unaware that anyone was observing her. She turned around and I caught a glimpse of her face as she scanned her bedroom. She was breath-taking. When I caught sight of her emerald green eyes, I realized those eyes were just as capable of seeing me back.

That‚Äôs when I caught myself.¬†*What the hell am I doing?*¬†I forced myself to look away and hurried toward the dumpster, my face burning with embarrassment.

But I couldn't stop thinking about her. The image of her beautiful auburn hair flowing against her back as she walked. I had barely even seen her face, but she was undoubtedly gorgeous.

That next morning when Bill showed up with my mail, I couldn‚Äôt help myself but ask him about the mysterious, alluring neighbor.

After a few pleasantries I took my chance, ""Hey, do you know the girl who lives on the second floor? Facing the back alley? Red hair, maybe an art student?""

The reflection in his glasses showed two of me staring back, eagerly waiting for a response. ""Oh, you mean Anna,"" he said after a moment. ""She's in 2B. Sweet girl, keeps to herself mostly. It‚Äôs her second year in this building. You thinking about introducing yourself?""

Anna. A palindrome. Even her name is poetic.

""Maybe,"" I said, trying to sound casual. ""Just wanted to get to know the neighbors, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, pal.‚Äù Bill smiled and gave me an awkward thumbs up before continuing down the block.

That evening, I found myself staring at my phone, debating whether or not to search for her. Just the name Anna wasn‚Äôt much to go off of, but with how small this town is, I could almost definitely find her on Instagram or Facebook.

I caved.

It started innocently enough. I was just curious to see if she had any public profiles online. I started by looking up ‚ÄúAnna‚Äù plus the name of our town. Then ‚ÄúAnna‚Äù plus the name of our college. It didn‚Äôt yield much, which wasn‚Äôt surprising. It was a Hail Mary in the first place with so little information. I was ready to put my phone away when I remembered the paint smeared on her shirt. It struck me,

*Maybe she‚Äôs an artist*...

It took a total of about twenty minutes but sure enough, there she was. Her business page on Instagram appeared. She apparently uses it to sell some of her art pieces around town. I thought that was about as far as I‚Äôd get before I noticed she tagged herself in one of the photos of a client holding her painting. I recognized the burnt orange hair in her profile picture immediately. I felt like a real Dick Tracy. Her Bio said she was a junior at the university, studying fine arts with a focus on 40‚Äôs Abstract Expressionism.

I scrolled through her profile. Pictures of her artwork featuring streaks of bold colors and unique textures. Photos of her out with friends at coffee shops and campus events. Her style was definitely more subdued, but I kind of liked that. She mostly opted for a pair of jeans and a graphic t-shirt. She also seemed to be fond of a particular dark green military jacket, most likely thrifted. It appeared in almost every other post. She seemed to save the dresses and jewelry for special occasions. I kept scrolling to find a few more selfies and even one with her wearing a Lou Reed shirt. The nineteen year-old version of me is currently a bit more rational, but a couple years ago I would have fallen head over heels for this girl in a heartbeat.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve changed as much as I like to think I have.

My eyes kept darting over my shoulder, as if someone was going to catch me in some perverted act. But I wasn‚Äôt necessarily doing anything wrong. At least I don‚Äôt think so. Her profile is public, so obviously she‚Äôs okay with people looking her up. Everyone searches their crushes on social media, right? It's practically expected these days.

As I pressed my thumb against the screen to swipe back, I must have held it just a second too long because I accidentally pressed a button on the top of her page. I followed her. My heart sank to my stomach as I quickly pressed the ‚ÄòUnfollow‚Äô prompt only a second after it had changed.

*Fuck‚Ä¶ you dumb ass.*¬†I thought to myself, taking a deep breath.¬†*It‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no way she saw it that quickly.*¬†I slammed my phone down on the side table and hoped a good night‚Äôs sleep would rid this embarrassment from my body.

That was when the scratching began again.

I woke up this morning in desperate need of caffeine, I opened my fridge to find an empty space where my energy drinks should‚Äôve been. I could‚Äôve swore I had at least two left, but between my lack of sleep and late night gaming binges, I didn‚Äôt put it past myself to have mindlessly finished them off. This meant a trip down to Mando‚Äôs, the small bodega just around the corner. Walking out, I reached for my keys on the hook behind the door and grasped at nothing but air.¬†*Damn it*, I thought. I left them in the kitchen the night before. But I told myself it was only a block away, and I'd be back in less than five minutes‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt need them.

Mando‚Äôs was one of those cramped little stores that still somehow manages to stock everything a drunk college student might need at 2AM. The clerk, a guy who looked to be in his forties with tired eyes, barely looked up from his phone when I walked in. His long brown hair hung like curtains, hiding most of his face. Multiple piercings and tattoos were scattered across his body without much cohesion.

""Just this,"" I said, placing two drinks on the counter.

He scanned them without enthusiasm. ""Six fifty.""

I handed him exact change and was heading for the door when he called after me.

""You live in the building on Maple Street, right? The brick one?""

I turned back, surprised. ""Yeah, how'd you know?""

""See you walking by sometimes. You're new, right?""

It was a bit unsettling to know someone was keeping tabs on me without my knowledge. I replied, ""Few months now.""

He nodded. ‚ÄúYou seen anything ‚Ä¶ strange since you‚Äôve moved in?‚Äù

I thought about the scratching in my walls. Part of me wanted to tell him, but the other, louder part, didn‚Äôt want to look like a raving lunatic. ‚ÄúNot really‚Ä¶‚Äù I responded. I knew it was probably just rats anyway.

His eyebrow raised. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was out of curiosity or judgment. ‚ÄúNothing? Damn.‚Äù His face shifted to disappointment. I‚Äôm assuming he saw the confusion on my face because he continued unprompted, ‚ÄúThat building used to be an old mental institution before they built the college here. The¬†*last*¬†guy who lived in your unit said he could still hear the screams of patients when he was trying to sleep.‚Äù He let out a light chuckle as he finished the sentence. An unsettling smile grew across his face. ‚ÄúSaid he could feel the eyes of the orderlies and doctors glaring at him from the dark corners of the room you don‚Äôt pay attention to. The sounds of patients desperately trying to claw their way out through the walls.‚Äù

I froze, t*he scratching‚Ä¶*¬†‚ÄúThe last guy?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYeah, haven‚Äôt seen him for a couple of months so I assume he must‚Äôve finally left. Dude seemed a little wacko, but hell if he didn‚Äôt come in here with some good stories.‚Äù The tone in his voice implied that I should come back with a better tale next time.

I hesitated to tell him about my experiences, how I had also heard the scratching sounds late at night. I quickly decided that it wasn‚Äôt worth the fifteen minute conversation it would turn into. At least not right now. ‚ÄúSorry. It‚Äôs been pretty quiet since I‚Äôve moved in.‚Äù

He shrugged and retreated back into his phone. I thanked him and headed outside, but his words stuck with me. The previous tenant had felt watched too...

As I approached my building, I spotted the silhouette of someone sitting on the steps leading up to the second floor apartments. I stepped closer and the figure became more clear. It was the girl from the window‚ÄîAnna. She was wearing that same green jacket I'd seen in her photos.

When she noticed me approaching, I felt this wave of embarrassment wash over me. I wanted to hurry past her without making eye contact, praying she hadn't somehow seen me looking at her the other night.

I was almost to my door when her voice stopped me.

""Are you the one who was peeping through my window the other night?""

I froze, the energy drinks suddenly feeling like they weighed a hundred pounds.

She was looking directly at me now, her expression more curious than angry. ""I live in 2B, second floor... Tuesday night, around eleven. You were by the dumpster and I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw you watching me.""

My face was burning. I wanted to deny it, to play dumb, to somehow make this conversation end. But she'd clearly seen me, and lying would only make it worse.

""I..."" I started, then stopped. How do you explain something like that without sounding like a complete creep? The honest answer felt impossible to say out loud.

""Well,"" I finally continued, ""your window was open.""

She stared at me for a moment, and I was sure she was about to tell me to stay away from her or threaten to call the cops. Instead, she started laughing.

""That's it? That's your excuse?""

""I mean, I stopped myself!"" I said quickly. ""I realized how weird it was and walked away. But yeah, for like ten seconds, I looked, and...‚Äù I trailed off, not sure how to finish that sentence without making it worse.

She laughed. ""At least you're honest,"" I was surprised to see she was still smiling. ""Most guys would have denied it completely or made up some dumb bull shit like ‚Äòoh I was admiring your posters‚Äô.

""There were posters?""

She shook her head and stood up, extending her hand toward me. ""I'm Anna, by the way.""

""Trevor. 1A."" I shook her hand, still not quite believing this conversation was happening. ""I'm really sorry about the... you know. Window thing. I swear I‚Äôm not normally like that. I haven‚Äôt made many friends since moving out here, and I think it‚Äôs messing with my head a little bit.""

""It's fine. Well, it's not really fine, but I appreciate the honesty. Just don‚Äôt do it again."" She smiled but her voice was stern. ‚ÄúAnd during the summer, this place really is a ghost town. I don‚Äôt blame you. I think we might be the only two people left in this building until August.‚Äù

We talked for a few more minutes and while most of it feels like a blur now, it must have went well because, before you know it, she had handed me her phone.

""Put your number in. I'm going out with some friends tomorrow night - nothing fancy, just this arcade downtown. You should come.""

I entered my contact information, still slightly stunned that being caught peeping had somehow led to getting an invitation out.

""I'll text you the details,"" she said, pocketing her phone. She flashed me a smile that could melt Mount Everest and headed back up the stairs. ""See you tomorrow, Trevor from 1A.""

I watched her disappear around the corner of the building before realizing that I was still holding my energy drinks. I headed toward my unit, feeling lighter than I had in weeks. An actual conversation with another human being. Plans for tomorrow night. The possibility of friends‚Ä¶ maybe even more.

Placing one of the drinks under my right arm, I reached to open the front door.

It was locked.

I stood still for a moment, confused.

I tried the handle again, then checked the apartment number to make sure I was at the right door. 1A, just like always.

""What the hell?"" I muttered, checking my pockets before remembering that my keys were sitting on the counter inside. I couldn't have locked the door.

I froze. Paranoia told me there was someone, or something, in my apartment. I stepped to the right and leaned in toward the window that looks into my kitchen. My mind was racing with possibilities. They ranged from the ‚Äòlikely‚Äô to the ‚Äòabsolutely insane‚Äô and everywhere in between.¬†*Did I close the door too hard and the bolt shut on it‚Äôs own? Did a homeless person get lucky checking door handles and is now holding himself up in my bedroom? Did one of the mental patients try to escape and the orderly locked the door before he reached it‚Ä¶?*¬†As I peered through the window, I saw nothing out of the ordinary. There were my keys splayed across the counter. With no other option, I had to call my landlord.

Carl, the maintenance man, showed up twenty minutes later with his master key. He looked mildly annoyed at being called out so early, but tried to hide it for me.

""Just glad it's something simple,"" he said as he unlocked my door. ""Could have been a lot worse.""

""Does this happen with a lot of units?"" I asked, genuinely confused about how a door could lock itself.

""Not recently,"" he paused. ""Actually, the guy who lived here before you was a real piece of work. Always complaining about weird stuff. Said he heard voices in the walls, kept talking about ghosts and people watching him. Kept calling about his door being locked when he swore he hadn't locked it. Not just the front door though. Bedroom, Bathroom, you name it.""

The mention of the previous tenant caught my attention. ""What happened to him?""

""Oh, he was a nightmare. Wouldn't pay rent on time, did all these modifications to the apartment without approval. Kept drilling holes in the walls, and claimed it helped stop the voices. I think he even had a special name for his paranormal friends‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWallflowers‚Äù, that's it. Guy basically squatted here for almost a year before we could get him evicted.""

Carl pushed open my door and stepped inside before grabbing my keys off of the hook and throwing them to me. ""One day I showed up with the landlord to serve him papers and he was just... gone. Left most of his stuff, never came back for his deposit. Probably moved on to terrorize some other building.""

""Did you ever find anything in the apartment‚Ä¶ in the walls?""

Carl shrugged. ""Nothing. Far as I could tell, he was just paranoid. Maybe doing too many drugs, you know? Started seeing things that weren't there. But he swore up and down that someone was watching him.‚Äù

We exchanged our goodbyes as he headed out and I thanked him again for the help. It wasn‚Äôt until the door was closed and he was gone that the realization struck me. A cold bead of sweat dripped down my spine as I looked down at the keys in my hand. I had just seen my keys on the kitchen counter less than 20 minutes ago. Why were they hanging on the hook when Carl grabbed them?

I spent the next several hours searching every corner of the house. The idea that someone made their way inside while I was gone wouldn‚Äôt leave me. Even after checking every room, I felt the need to check them again. I kept imagining I was playing a sick game of musical chairs‚Äîthe squatter following behind me as I checked each room and hiding out in the one I had only just cleared. I did one more sweep of the rooms, this time in a different order. They wouldn‚Äôt outsmart if that was the case.

I went Live about an hour later than usual tonight, finally convincing myself that I was home alone. Every room and closet was empty and every possible hiding spot was clear. But as soon as my stream started, something felt different.

I just went live and my viewer count is already at 1, like someone had been sitting there refreshing my page, waiting for me to start.

A notification was waiting for me in the chat.

1lkp5qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lkp5qe/i_have_one_new_follower_part_1/,I have one new follower. [Part 1],"Have you ever been to a college town in the summer? It feels like the rapture happened overnight. One minute the streets are filled with graduates eager to start their vacation, the next they‚Äôre lifeless and empty. As a newcomer in this area, the silence is incredibly lonesome.

Don't get me wrong, the town itself is fine. It's one of those classic university communities where half the population turns over every semester and the other half has been here since the 1960s. Coffee shops on every corner, bookstores that smell like old paper and water damage, and so many bars that it makes you question how they can all stay in business at the same time. The kind of place that looks perfect in college brochures.

I can‚Äôt complain, especially since my mom agreed to cover my stay here if I promised to keep my GPA up. In fact, she was ecstatic when I proposed moving halfway across the country. Which, to be honest, was a bit of a surprise. Growing up, she‚Äôd always been more on the overprotective side. Constantly keeping track of my location and always checking the locks twice before we went to bed. To her credit, we‚Äôd had a pretty bad break-in when I was four years old. It messed her up for quite a while, but I was too young to remember much of what happened. Whenever I try to think about that night, it‚Äôs just distant, fuzzy images of the police dragging someone out of my bedroom and throwing them into a cop car.

The problem isn‚Äôt the town, the problem is me. Or more specifically, how hard it is for me to make friends.

Back home, I had a close knit group. Most of us had known each other since elementary school and spent every free second we had together. Nearly a decade of inside jokes, backyard concerts and video game tournaments had come to an end this summer. Now everyone's scattered across different states, different time zones. We try to stay in touch through group chats and video calls, but it's not the same. Jake's busy with his engineering program, Marcus is working two jobs to pay for school, and Sarah's three hours ahead on the East Coast. By the time I'm free to hang out, they're already asleep, studying or living their new lives without me.

Most days, the only person I actually talk to face-to-face is Bill, my mailman.

Bill's in his fifties and sports a pair of massive blue sunglasses that take up half of his face. He wears them every single day regardless of weather. His skin looks as though he was a surfer, leathery and thick after years of direct sun. Either that or he needed to cutback on the spray tans. He's friendly enough though, always asks how I'm settling in, if I need anything, the kind of small talk that makes you feel less invisible.

""Another package for you today."" Bill handed me the box, his massive sunglasses reflecting my disheveled appearance. ""You sure do order a lot of stuff online.""

""Easier than figuring out where all the stores are,"" I told him, which was partially true. The real truth was that ordering things online meant I had something to look forward to, even if it was just a new webcam I'd impulse-bought at 2 AM.

""I get it. If you ever need someone to show you around, just let me know."" His smile was genuine, and for a moment my loneliness subsided. If only for a moment. When your mailman is the closest thing you have to a regular social interaction, you know you're in trouble.

That's probably why I started streaming.

It seemed like the perfect solution for an introvert like myself. I could connect with people without having to navigate the awkward social dynamics of college parties or trying to insert myself into established friend groups.

My setup was pretty basic. A decent webcam, a microphone that didn't sound too terrible, and my gaming PC positioned so my bed wasn't visible in the background. I had to keep an air of professionalism somehow. I even bought a few LED strips to finish off my ‚ÄòCliche Streamer Starter Kit.‚Äô

For the first two weeks, my viewer count stayed at a solid zero. Occasionally someone would pop in, maybe say ""hi"" in chat, then disappear after a minute or two. I tried different games, different times of day, nothing seemed to work. I couldn‚Äôt help but think that at a certain point, I had gone from streaming to genuinely just talking to myself.

But I kept at it.

It was during this time that I started noticing small things around my apartment that seemed... wrong. Nothing dramatic, just tiny details that made me question my own memory. I'd leave a coffee mug on my desk and find it in the kitchen sink later‚Äîclean but still slightly warm, like it had been recently washed. Books on my shelf would be arranged differently. Nothing wildly out of order, just shifted enough that the spines didn't line up the way I remembered leaving them.

At first I chalked it up to stress. Moving to a new place, being isolated, spending too much time alone. My brain was playing tricks on me. Everyone misplaces things.

Then last week, something changed with my streams. I went live around 9 PM like usual, ready for another night of incessantly talking to myself while playing some indie horror game I'd picked up on sale. After about 20 minutes of radio silence, my viewer count showed 1 instead of 0.

Someone was actually watching.

I tried to play it cool, didn't want to scare them off by being too eager. ""Hey there, welcome to the stream,"" I said, trying to sound natural. ""Thanks for hanging out with me tonight.""

The viewer didn't say anything in chat. No introduction, no emoticons, nothing. But they stayed. For the entire two-hour stream, that little ""1"" never moved. Someone was genuinely watching me play, listening to me ramble about game mechanics and random thoughts that popped into my head.

It should have felt good. Finally, after weeks of streaming to an empty room, I had a viewer. But something about it made me uncomfortable. Maybe it was the complete silence on their end. I know it‚Äôs normal for someone to watch a stream passively, but I can‚Äôt shake the uncanny feeling that I was being‚Ä¶ observed.

Right before I was about to end the stream and log off for the night, a message finally appeared in chat.

**wx11flow3r\_75:** ‚ÄúI love watching you...‚Äù

Before I could respond, they left. The viewer count dropped back to 0, and I was left alone in my apartment again.

That night, I heard something in the walls behind my head.

I was lying in bed, scrolling through my phone and trying to wind down, when I heard a faint scratching sound. I wanted to believe it was just the building settling, but something about the noise felt purposeful. Like fingernails dragging slowly across wood.

The sound seemed to move around me toward the wall where my computer setup was. I followed it, crouching down under my desk to get closer to the baseboard. Whatever it was, it stopped moving. That's when I noticed a small hole in the wall. Fresh wood shavings littered the baseboard below it‚Äîthis wasn't here yesterday. It was barely visible, maybe half an inch wide with cracks spider-webbing outward behind my computer.

As I leaned closer to examine it, I felt a strange temperature change wash over me. A warm blast of air brushed against my skin before returning to normal. I leaned even closer. The scratching stopped.

Peering into the small hole, I saw the glossy shine of an eye staring back at me. It was pure black and unmoving. My muscles tensed as my body entered a state of fight-or-flight. I hurled myself backward out of instinct and let out a stifled scream. As I landed on the ground, I heard the scratching begin again, even more frantic. But this time, the scratching was accompanied by another sound: Squeaking.  
  
*Jesus Christ, it was just a rat?* I thought, as I sighed a long breath of equal relief and frustration. Of course it was a rat. This is an old building and the summer heat drives them inside. I'd dealt with mice in my bedroom growing up. This was essentially the same thing, just bigger.

I spent the rest of the night convincing myself there was nothing supernatural happening in my apartment, tossing and turning feverishly as the scratches intermittently returned.

Days passed without much excitement. I streamed every night and without fail, ‚Äò**wx11flow3r\_75**‚Äô was there. At least, I had to assume it was them. Even though a message rarely ever popped up in chat, my viewer count never wavered from 1. At times it felt voyeuristic, but in a way, I guess that‚Äôs the appeal of live streams. I grew to enjoy the company of that number ‚Äú1‚Äù some nights, knowing that at least someone was there with me.

Two days ago I ended my stream a little early to the disappointment of my ‚Äòfaithful viewer‚Äô.  
  
‚ÄúAlright guys, I‚Äôm gonna end it here for the night. I have to clean up my place a little bit before bed, it‚Äôs a fucking mess.‚Äù I said, taking off my headphones and closing out of the game as I looked around the disheveled work station.  
  
Just as I clicked ‚ÄòEnd Stream‚Äô, a message in the chat appeared.  
  
**wx11flow3r\_75:** ‚Äòno, please! I barely get to see you anymore.‚Äô

I didn‚Äôt have time to respond before the live stream cut out. I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve even known how to respond. What could they have meant by barely got to see me anymore? I shook it off and stuck to my plan of tidying up the apartment. I loaded up empty cans of energy drinks and Styrofoam boxes of leftover fast food into a trash bag and made my way to the dumpsters.

As I walked around to the back of the building, I spotted movement in one of the second floor windows. I probably should have minded my own business, kept walking, thrown away my garbage and gone back inside. But something compelled me to stop and look.

It was a girl‚Äîroughly my age‚Äîwith dark red hair pulled back in a loose ponytail. She was in what looked like her bedroom, pulling off a paint splattered t-shirt and replacing it with a rather tight fitting sweater. The back light of her bedroom hugged the curves of her skin, making it seem like her form was glowing. For just a moment I stood there, gazing at her through the window. She moved around her room with effortless grace, completely unaware that anyone was observing her. She turned around and I caught a glimpse of her face as she scanned her bedroom. She was breath-taking. When I caught sight of her emerald green eyes, I realized those eyes were just as capable of seeing me back.

That‚Äôs when I caught myself. *What the hell am I doing?* I forced myself to look away and hurried toward the dumpster, my face burning with embarrassment.

But I couldn't stop thinking about her. The image of her beautiful auburn hair flowing against her back as she walked. I had barely even seen her face, but she was undoubtedly gorgeous.

That next morning when Bill showed up with my mail, I couldn‚Äôt help myself but ask him about the mysterious, alluring neighbor.

After a few pleasantries I took my chance, ""Hey, do you know the girl who lives on the second floor? Facing the back alley? Red hair, maybe an art student?""

The reflection in his glasses showed two of me staring back, eagerly waiting for a response. ""Oh, you mean Anna,"" he said after a moment. ""She's in 2B. Sweet girl, keeps to herself mostly. It‚Äôs her second year in this building. You thinking about introducing yourself?""

Anna. A palindrome. Even her name is poetic.

""Maybe,"" I said, trying to sound casual. ""Just wanted to get to know the neighbors, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, pal.‚Äù Bill smiled and gave me an awkward thumbs up before continuing down the block.

That evening, I found myself staring at my phone, debating whether or not to search for her. Just the name Anna wasn‚Äôt much to go off of, but with how small this town is, I could almost definitely find her on Instagram or Facebook.

I caved.

It started innocently enough. I was just curious to see if she had any public profiles online. I started by looking up ‚ÄúAnna‚Äù plus the name of our town. Then ‚ÄúAnna‚Äù plus the name of our college. It didn‚Äôt yield much, which wasn‚Äôt surprising. It was a Hail Mary in the first place with so little information. I was ready to put my phone away when I remembered the paint smeared on her shirt. It struck me,

*Maybe she‚Äôs an artist*...

It took a total of about twenty minutes but sure enough, there she was. Her business page on Instagram appeared. She apparently uses it sell some of her art pieces around town. I thought that was about as far as I‚Äôd get before I noticed she tagged herself in one of the photos of a client holding her painting. I recognized the burnt orange hair in her profile picture immediately. I felt like a real Dick Tracy. Her Bio said she was a junior at the university, studying fine arts with a focus on 40‚Äôs Abstract Expressionism.

I scrolled through her profile. Pictures of her artwork featuring streaks of bold colors and unique textures. Photos of her out with friends at coffee shops and campus events. Her style was definitely more subdued, but I kind of liked that. She mostly opted for a pair of jeans and a graphic t-shirt. She also seemed to be fond of a particular dark green military jacket, most likely thrifted. It appeared in almost every other post. She seemed to save the dresses and jewelry for special occasions. I kept scrolling to find a few more selfies and even one with her wearing a Lou Reed shirt. The nineteen year-old version of me is currently a bit more rational, but a couple years ago I would have fallen head over heels for this girl in a heartbeat.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve changed as much as I like to think I have.

My eyes kept darting over my shoulder, as if someone was going to catch me in some perverted act. But I wasn‚Äôt necessarily doing anything wrong. At least I don‚Äôt think so. Her profile is public, so obviously she‚Äôs okay with people looking her up. Everyone searches their crushes on social media, right? It's practically expected these days.

As I pressed my thumb against the screen to swipe back, I must have held it just a second too long because I accidentally pressed a button on the top of her page. I followed her. My heart sank to my stomach as I quickly pressed the ‚ÄòUnfollow‚Äô prompt only a second after it had changed.

*Fuck‚Ä¶ you dumb ass.* I thought to myself, taking a deep breath. *It‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no way she saw it that quickly.* I slammed my phone down on the side table and hoped a good night‚Äôs sleep would rid this embarrassment from my body.  
  
That was when the scratching began again.

I woke up this morning in desperate need of caffeine, I opened my fridge to find an empty space where my energy drinks should‚Äôve been. I could‚Äôve swore I had at least two left, but between my lack of sleep and late night gaming binges, I didn‚Äôt put it past myself to have mindlessly finished them off. This meant a trip down to Mando‚Äôs, the small bodega just around the corner. Walking out, I reached for my keys on the hook behind the door and grasped at nothing but air. *Damn it*, I thought. I left them in the kitchen the night before. But I told myself it was only a block away, and I'd be back in less than five minutes‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt need them.

Mando‚Äôs was one of those cramped little stores that still somehow manages to stock everything a drunk college student might need at 2AM. The clerk, a guy who looked to be in his forties with tired eyes, barely looked up from his phone when I walked in. His long brown hair hung like curtains, hiding most of his face. Multiple piercings and tattoos were scattered across his body without much cohesion.

""Just this,"" I said, placing two drinks on the counter.

He scanned them without enthusiasm. ""Six fifty.""

I handed him exact change and was heading for the door when he called after me.

""You live in the building on Maple Street, right? The brick one?""

I turned back, surprised. ""Yeah, how'd you know?""

""See you walking by sometimes. You're new, right?""

It was a bit unsettling to know someone was keeping tabs on me without my knowledge. I replied, ""Few months now.""

He nodded. ‚ÄúYou seen anything ‚Ä¶ strange since you‚Äôve moved in?‚Äù

I thought about the scratching in my walls. Part of me wanted to tell him, but the other, louder part, didn‚Äôt want to look like a raving lunatic. ‚ÄúNot really‚Ä¶‚Äù I responded. I knew it was probably just rats anyway.

His eyebrow raised. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was out of curiosity or judgment. ‚ÄúNothing? Damn.‚Äù His face shifted to disappointment. I‚Äôm assuming he saw the confusion on my face because he continued unprompted, ‚ÄúThat building used to be an old mental institution before they built the college here. The *last* guy who lived in your unit said he could still hear the screams of patients when he was trying to sleep.‚Äù He let out a light chuckle as he finished the sentence. An unsettling smile grew across his face. ‚ÄúSaid he could feel the eyes of the orderlies and doctors glaring at him from the dark corners of the room you don‚Äôt pay attention to. The sounds of patients desperately trying to claw their way out through the walls.‚Äù 

I froze, t*he scratching‚Ä¶* ‚ÄúThe last guy?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYeah, haven‚Äôt seen him for a couple of months so I assume he must‚Äôve finally left. Dude seemed a little wacko, but hell if he didn‚Äôt come in here with some good stories.‚Äù The tone in his voice implied that I should come back with a better tale next time.

  
I hesitated to tell him about my experiences, how I had also heard the scratching sounds late at night. I quickly decided that it wasn‚Äôt worth the fifteen minute conversation it would turn into. At least not right now. ‚ÄúSorry. It‚Äôs been pretty quiet since I‚Äôve moved in.‚Äù

He shrugged and retreated back into his phone. I thanked him and headed outside, but his words stuck with me. The previous tenant had felt watched too...

As I approached my building, I spotted the silhouette of someone sitting on the steps leading up to the second floor apartments. I stepped closer and the figure became more clear. It was the girl from the window‚ÄîAnna. She was wearing that same green jacket I'd seen in her photos.

When she noticed me approaching, I felt this wave of embarrassment wash over me. I wanted to hurry past her without making eye contact, praying she hadn't somehow seen me looking at her the other night.

I was almost to my door when her voice stopped me.

""Are you the one who was peeping through my window the other night?""

I froze, the energy drinks suddenly feeling like they weighed a hundred pounds.

She was looking directly at me now, her expression more curious than angry. ""I live in 2B, second floor... Tuesday night, around eleven. You were by the dumpster and I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw you watching me.""

My face was burning. I wanted to deny it, to play dumb, to somehow make this conversation end. But she'd clearly seen me, and lying would only make it worse.

""I..."" I started, then stopped. How do you explain something like that without sounding like a complete creep? The honest answer felt impossible to say out loud.

""Well,"" I finally continued, ""your window was open.""

She stared at me for a moment, and I was sure she was about to tell me to stay away from her or threaten to call the cops. Instead, she started laughing.

""That's it? That's your excuse?""

""I mean, I stopped myself!"" I said quickly. ""I realized how weird it was and walked away. But yeah, for like ten seconds, I looked, and...‚Äù I trailed off, not sure how to finish that sentence without making it worse.

She laughed. ""At least you're honest,"" I was surprised to see she was still smiling. ""Most guys would have denied it completely or made up some dumb bull shit like ‚Äòoh I was admiring your posters‚Äô.

""There were posters?""

She shook her head and stood up, extending her hand toward me. ""I'm Anna, by the way.""

""Trevor. 1A."" I shook her hand, still not quite believing this conversation was happening. ""I'm really sorry about the... you know. Window thing. I swear I‚Äôm not normally like that. I haven‚Äôt made many friends since moving out here, and I think it‚Äôs messing with my head a little bit.""

""It's fine. Well, it's not really fine, but I appreciate the honesty. Just don‚Äôt do it again."" She smiled but her voice was stern. ‚ÄúAnd during the summer, this place really is a ghost town. I don‚Äôt blame you. I think we might be the only two people left in this building until August.‚Äù

We talked for a few more minutes and while most of it feels like a blur now, it must have went well because, before you know it, she had handed me her phone.  
  
""Put your number in. I'm going out with some friends tomorrow night - nothing fancy, just this arcade downtown. You should come.""

I entered my contact information, still slightly stunned that being caught peeping had somehow led to getting an invitation out.

""I'll text you the details,"" she said, pocketing her phone. She flashed me a smile that could melt Mount Everest and headed back up the stairs. ""See you tomorrow, Trevor from 1A.""

I watched her disappear around the corner of the building before realizing that I was still holding my energy drinks. I headed toward my unit, feeling lighter than I had in weeks. An actual conversation with another human being. Plans for tomorrow night. The possibility of friends‚Ä¶ maybe even more.

Placing one of the drinks under my right arm, I reached to open the front door.

It was locked.

I stood still for a moment, confused.

I tried the handle again, then checked the apartment number to make sure I was at the right door. 1A, just like always.

""What the hell?"" I muttered, checking my pockets before remembering that my keys were sitting on the counter inside. I couldn't have locked the door.

I froze. Paranoia told me there was someone, or something, in my apartment. I stepped to the right and leaned in toward the window that looks into my kitchen. My mind was racing with possibilities. They ranged from the ‚Äòlikely‚Äô to the ‚Äòabsolutely insane‚Äô and everywhere in between. *Did I close the door too hard and the bolt shut on it‚Äôs own? Did a homeless person get lucky checking door handles and is now holding himself up in my bedroom? Did one of the mental patients try to escape and the orderly locked the door before he reached it‚Ä¶?* As I peered through the window, I saw nothing out of the ordinary. There were my keys splayed across the counter. With no other option, I had to call my landlord.

Carl, the maintenance man, showed up twenty minutes later with his master key. He looked mildly annoyed at being called out so early, but tried to hide it for me.

""Just glad it's something simple,"" he said as he unlocked my door. ""Could have been a lot worse.""

""Does this happen with a lot of units?"" I asked, genuinely confused about how a door could lock itself.

""Not recently,"" he paused. ""Actually, the guy who lived here before you was a real piece of work. Always complaining about weird stuff. Said he heard voices in the walls, kept talking about ghosts and people watching him. Kept calling about his door being locked when he swore he hadn't locked it. Not just the front door though. Bedroom, Bathroom, you name it.""

The mention of the previous tenant caught my attention. ""What happened to him?""

""Oh, he was a nightmare. Wouldn't pay rent on time, did all these modifications to the apartment without approval. Kept drilling holes in the walls, and claimed it helped stop the voices. I think he even had a special name for his paranormal friends‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWallflowers‚Äù, that's it. Guy basically squatted here for almost a year before we could get him evicted.""

Carl pushed open my door and stepped inside before grabbing my keys off of the hook and throwing them to me. ""One day I showed up with the landlord to serve him papers and he was just... gone. Left most of his stuff, never came back for his deposit. Probably moved on to terrorize some other building.""

""Did you ever find anything in the apartment‚Ä¶ in the walls?""

Carl shrugged. ""Nothing. Far as I could tell, he was just paranoid. Maybe doing too many drugs, you know? Started seeing things that weren't there. But he swore up and down that someone was watching him.‚Äù

We exchanged our goodbyes as he headed out and I thanked him again for the help. It wasn‚Äôt until the door was closed and he was gone that the realization struck me. A cold bead of sweat dripped down my spine as I looked down at the keys in my hand. I had just seen my keys on the kitchen counter less than 20 minutes ago. Why were they hanging on the hook when Carl grabbed them?

I spent the next several hours searching every corner of the house. The idea that someone made their way inside while I was gone wouldn‚Äôt leave me. Even after checking every room, I felt the need to check them again. I kept imagining I was playing a sick game of musical chairs‚Äîthe squatter following behind me as I checked each room and hiding out in the one I had only just cleared. I did one more sweep of the rooms, this time in a different order. They wouldn‚Äôt outsmart if that was the case.  
  
I went Live about an hour later than usual tonight, finally convincing myself that I was home alone. Every room and closet was empty and every possible hiding spot was clear. But as soon as my stream started, something felt different.

I just went live and my viewer count is already at 1, like someone had been sitting there refreshing my page, waiting for me to start.

A notification was waiting for me in the chat.

1lkp5k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cant_sleep/comments/1lkp5k2/a_notebook_found_in_vostok/,A Notebook Found in Vostok,"Before you read this post, I want to preface that this is NOT my story, so the things that happen didn‚Äôt happen to me personally. Me and a few buddies are urban explorers; something we enjoy doing a lot. We were exploring a rumored abandoned town in Russia. I don‚Äôt think it had a name, so it will be known as Vostok. Vostok is deep in the far east of Russia, nestled between large mountains and dense forestry. The closest city to it (which we were at previously to even get here) is 300km+ away; or 180 miles+.¬†

Being in subarctic conditions, suffice it to say; it was really flippin cold. Just landing in Vladivostok was enough for me to regret my decision to come. We heard about the town from a Russian internet friend. We had to pay some local to take us to the town, which was fine because he had us drink in his house and chat. We didn‚Äôt really have to pay him much, he was just happy to do something rather than sit around I suppose. He did question why we were heading there though, not sure why? We brushed him off.

Anyways, it actually was pretty difficult to get to the town. I know I haven‚Äôt really said everything or described why it was, but trust me, you‚Äôll find out why. When we got to the town, it was abandoned as we hoped. In fact, I didn‚Äôt believe anyone had lived there in decades. In our time exploring we found a notebook in a power station at the outskirts of the town. The door leading in the building was broken and, on the ground, with very large claw marks on it. I thought it was a bear, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I was wrong.¬†

We didn‚Äôt stay too long at the town as it had begun to blizzard.¬†*In hindsight, that was probably a good idea.*¬†I‚Äôll write down everything that is in the Notebook, from beginning to end. Maybe I'll give some thoughts during it, maybe not; there‚Äôs a lot to type, this might take me a few days to put together. Without saying too much, let‚Äôs just get into it.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Josef Markees. Me and some friends from my hometown got shit-faced and went for a late-night drive 3 moons ago. Our luck was not something we relied on. So, when our car broke down and we found ourselves stranded in the woods, surprise wasn't an emotion felt. John wanted to travel back to where we came from, but Alex, who wasn't entirely wasted (I blame him for our situation), said we were already too far out and would probably die trying.¬†

Whenever we all traveled, Alex liked being in tune with the locals. It was something he did so he could ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù or ‚Äútake in‚Äù the experience better. I'm sure it was just him trying to get laid. Having spoken a bit with the locals though, or, specifically one local, he heard about an abandoned town that shouldn‚Äôt be too far from where we were located. Apparently, he heard about it because of a local legend, I can‚Äôt recall what it was about. Something about Soviet Scientists & Military. I‚Äôm sure that the legends were mostly told by youth the more he talked about it.

We didn‚Äôt really have much of a choice since we were impaired and absolutely freezing. We brought clothes that would help us fight the bitter cold here, but the nighttime was a different story. We already had stuff in the back of the car. Some of it was rock climbing equipment (It was a fun hobby of mine), some of it was cave diving equipment from Jimmy and John, and the rest was different survival equipment since Ajax was deathly scared of dying out in the middle of nowhere‚Ä¶ like right now.

We couldn‚Äôt carry all of the equipment since there was a lot of it, but we grabbed enough. Alex and John lead the way with our half-charged flashlights. When I say it was painfully cold, it‚Äôs an understatement. Just the time it took to discuss what to do already left me numb and shaky. It only took a bit before reaching this secret. I didn‚Äôt even realize we arrived since it was so dark and there were zero lights on.¬†

Apparently, we had entered the building before I could think about how we were in the town.

I didn‚Äôt know until morning, but it was an old train station. I don‚Äôt know the last time it was in use; it doesn‚Äôt really matter. What did matter though was that the building had power. It was a very nice feeling to have. Inside was very dusty. Opening the door was very loud, I was glad there wasn't a crazy recluse waiting for someone to enter their abode and pounce. Alex and John quickly searched the building while the rest of us caught our breaths, disturbing the air to the brink of no recovery. After a bit, they came back and found an old heater that still worked in a break room.

The rest of the night was a blur, but we got through fine it seemed. In the morning, we all drank some water we had in the bags, which wasn't a lot, then discussed our plan. Brighton suggested that we could wait and wave someone down at the road, but Alex shut that idea down, saying there was only one road that led into the town and nobody drives over here. The group started trying to figure a way out. I couldn‚Äôt keep up since I drank so much last night and my head was killing me, so I went outside.

The sky was colorless and gray, like it has been since we got here. It was quite cold outside. Inside wasn't much better, but the old furnace sufficed. The town was very quiet. There was no smoke from any homes, no tracks on the ground, it snowed slightly over last night, but still. There isn‚Äôt even any birdsong or any sort of animals for that matter. Or people.

Before I could finish my thoughts that were running like a faucet, the group came outside. Alex said he and John were heading back to the car to check if it might be fixable, until then just stay about. Brighton warned them to be careful, that there might be some dangerous wildlife around. John jokingly said back ‚ÄúHe felt better in the wilderness than this town‚Äù, to Brighton's unamusement. Alex and John trekked their way back to the car, retracing their barely visible tracks. We all watched them vanish off in the distance before Jimmy turned and went back into the building, we soon followed as well.

For a bit, we all just sat in the lounge, Jimmy saying how insane all this is and Brighton talking about how stupid we were for getting ourselves in this situation. Me on the other hand, was still too tired to comprehend how boned we really were. After a while longer, Brighton suggested we all go out and explore this town. Everyone seemed fine with it, including me, but I stayed out to dance with sleep some more. They were ok with that and headed out, I went back into the break room where the heater was, and slept.

I woke up when the group came back, they weren‚Äôt exactly quiet. They told me about the town square, some houses, and a general store. It had some food in it, most of it was rotten, but there were frozen canned goods. Brighton described how most of the places were preserved pretty well, most of the houses were left like they had never been abandoned.¬†

Brighton began writing the layout on some old parchment paper while Jimmy rambled on about how uneasy he felt, like he was being watched. Druggies. Ajax was quiet mostly throughout our banter, like usual. A few minutes later, I stopped and realized that Alex and John hadn't returned yet. The rest of the group found it strange as well. I took a look outside and also realized that the sky was beginning to dark, how long was I out for?

We decided to wait longer inside the station, despite Jimmy‚Äôs protests. That was a good idea, because 30 or so minutes later, Alex and John did return. Alex had John's arm around his shoulder, John had twisted his ankle on the way back. He sat him down and relayed the info they got. ‚ÄúThe car's finished,‚Äù Alex said. ‚ÄúCompletely gone. Not just frozen, something's fried. Fuel‚Äôs no good either, thick, sludgy.‚Äù, ""Everything‚Äôs wrong with it,"" John added. ""It just... died\*.\* Like it wanted to.""¬†

Nightfall came quicker than expected, most of us remained quiet, with occasional suggestions of what to do, mostly shot down by rationality. We ate some protein bars and canned goods we had left over. It was a sad night. The Station grew darker and colder. The last thing I remember last night was Jimmy saying. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre stuck, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The night felt longer than the others. Maybe because the cold got worse.¬†

Maybe because of the footsteps.¬†

Around midnight, Brighton thought she heard someone walking outside. I also thought I heard it too. Slow steps, heavy. Crunching like someone dragging their boots deliberately. We checked the windows.¬†

No movement. No figures.¬†

I tried to laugh it off. It didn‚Äôt land. We waited longer, but heard nothing else. Brighton found a locked hatch in the main hallway. Steel and heavy. It was covered with a rug, one we definitely moved before, and somehow‚Ä¶ missed? Ajax said he didn‚Äôt like it. Kept saying it ‚Äúfelt off.‚Äù No one opened it. Not yet.

Something else happened.¬†

I haven‚Äôt told anyone.

I probably should‚Äôve.

I felt something. Tight. Heavy. Like someone was still standing just beyond the window outside.¬†

I had goosebumps all up and down my body, something I hadn‚Äôt noticed until Ajax pointed it out himself how he had some too.

I didn‚Äôt move. I just sat there, listening, barely breathing. Then I looked across the room. Alex was asleep. On the floor. His coat draped over him, hand tucked under his head. He didn‚Äôt move once. Brighton and Ajax were chilling together, drinking some hot drinks.

I didn‚Äôt dream of it. I don‚Äôt think I didn‚Äôt? Maybe sleep deprivation messes with you. Maybe the stress of the situation is getting to me a little bit. I feel too nauseous to think straight. I‚Äôm heading to bed again.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I woke up early again this morning. I think it‚Äôs 6 or 7 in the morning, can‚Äôt exactly tell. I wish we brung phones. Everyone was still asleep except Brighton. I checked the whole place and couldn‚Äôt find her. I went outside and past the hatch on the ground, it made my skin crawl like there were bugs in them. As I went to open the door, it opened itself. My heart flatlined for a few I‚Äôm pretty sure.¬†

It was Brighton.

She looked equally as scared by my presence. Laughing it off though, she mentioned how she had to use the bathroom. I noticed she had a nose bleed, and mentioned something about‚Ä¶ womanly things, she didn‚Äôt like that. She wiped the blood off her face with the hem of her sleeve, then walked into the Ticket Office. She called me into it and showed me a map on the wall.

She expressed her feeling of frustration working on the map outside while there was one in here the entire time. I laughed a little at that. The map on the wall looked pretty old and dated. It said some words in Russian, I don‚Äôt speak it, so much of it was just nonsense to me. It did have the date 1978 on it though. It clearly had the town's layout on it and some train routes.¬†

The train station had three tracks. One inbound that headed out to the West and East, the one East splitting into 2, one continuing East and one heading South. Under it it says something in Russia, then a date marked as 1986. I‚Äôm not sure what it is about. There is also a barely-visible overlay beneath the Station and extending East. More words I don‚Äôt understand, but there is an outline marked in red. One of the labels next to it was scratched out too.¬†

This definitely was not part of the Stations map, but later added or repurposed.

At the end of the rail lines, they all were marked with a red X. Two of them say something in Russian and one is marked with the number ‚Äú17‚Äù. In the top left corner of the map lay a faded railway seal. But in the bottom right, a smaller emblem, a five-pointed star with no text, almost like a branding mark. Possibly military, or internal security.

We stood side by side, studying that old diagram like it might change if we looked hard enough.

She pointed first, the red square beneath the eastern quarter of the town. No label, just thick lines, thicker than anything else on the map. Bold, permanent, like whoever drew it wanted to make sure no one accidentally missed it.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right under the station,‚Äù she said.

I added the fact that. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the one in the hallway, where we found the hatch.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

There was another silence. Comfortable, at first. Then not.

We compared the map to her sketches that she had drawn yesterday. At least two buildings marked didn‚Äôt exist anymore, she mentioned. One might have collapsed. One‚Äôs just... gone. Like it never was. The red square connects to a dozen smaller paths. One ends right beneath the administrative building. Another dives deep under the forest edge.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they built this town around the station,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúThey built it around whatever‚Äôs under it.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt talk after that. Just stood there, tracing lines with our eyes. Pretending as if we are uncovering something we‚Äôre not supposed to.

The others started to stir. The room was cold enough to see your breath again. I was still in the ticket office, Brighton leaning against the far wall. Neither of us had moved much. Ajax was first. Quiet, still bleary eyed. Jimmy sat up next, rubbing his face like he‚Äôd just had a nightmare he couldn‚Äôt remember. John didn‚Äôt say a word. Just checked his ankle, winced, and went back to pretending to be asleep. Alex met us in the hallway between the lounge and the ticket office. He could tell something had changed. Brighton gestured for him to come look.

We waited until they were all gathered. All of us stood around that aging map like we were reading a eulogy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more underneath,‚Äù Brighton said. ‚ÄúThe station, the town, it‚Äôs all built over something else.‚Äù ‚ÄúTunnels,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúStorage. Labs. Something marked in Russian\*.\* It‚Äôs all here.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt react at first.

Jimmy blinked hard. Ajax looked at the map, then at me, then back again, like he didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge it. John muttered something incoherent. Alex stayed quiet the longest. He kept glancing between the map and the hallway, like he was working through equations no one else could see.

‚ÄúYou think that hatch leads down into it?‚Äù he asked. Brighton nodded. ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why don‚Äôt we open it?‚Äù

No one answered.

Jimmy finally broke the silence with something that made everyone pause.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I think we‚Äôre not supposed to.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt being dramatic. His voice was low, resigned. Like he‚Äôd accepted it long ago and just hadn‚Äôt said it out loud yet. I looked back at the hallway. I couldn‚Äôt see the hatch from where I stood, but I swear I felt it. Like it was listening.

We didn‚Äôt open it today either.

But it‚Äôs there.

And it‚Äôs waiting.

The rest of the day was still. Strangely still. Like the town knew we‚Äôd found something and was giving us time to sit with it. No voices. No strange sounds. No shifting shadows or disappearing tools. Almost peaceful‚Ä¶ Almost.

We stayed indoors, rationed food, rotated who kept the fire stoked. Brighton redrew the tunnel map from memory. Ajax made tea that tasted like moldy cardboard, but no one complained. Alex spent a lot of time standing at the station‚Äôs front window, hands in his pockets, watching the sky. Late afternoon, he finally spoke up.¬†

‚ÄúThe pressure‚Äôs dropping fast,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTemperature too. We‚Äôre in for something bad. Maybe tonight. Maybe tomorrow.‚Äù No one questioned how he knew all this.

He didn‚Äôt say blizzard, but we all felt it behind his words.

Jimmy asked if we could hike out before it hit. Alex shook his head.

‚ÄúThe snow‚Äôs too deep now. Tracks are gone. Landmarks too.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what then?‚Äù John asked. ‚ÄúWait it out?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf it turns into whiteout conditions,‚Äù Alex said, ‚Äúthis station probably won‚Äôt hold enough heat to keep us alive.‚Äù

He looked at Brighton, then me.

‚ÄúThat hatch leads somewhere. If it‚Äôs insulated... shielded... it might be warmer below ground. At least long enough to survive the worst of it.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt want to say it. But he did.¬†

And for the first time, no one argued. We didn‚Äôt open it. Not yet. But we know now. If the storm comes, we‚Äôll go down.

God help us.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We left just before sunset. Ajax and me.

I didn‚Äôt ask for permission. Just told them we‚Äôd be back soon. Brighton looked up from her sketchbook and said nothing. John scoffed and tightened the blanket around his shoulders. Alex gave one of those long sighs that says more than words ever could. Jimmy actually said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù Twice.

I left anyway. I needed to move. Sitting too long with the same faces, in the same gray walls, breathing the same breath‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like the place itself starts to compress you. Ajax came without hesitation. I think he‚Äôs started to follow me because he doesn‚Äôt know what else to do.

We took the south path, past the broken post office and a blackened fountain. The town's still wrong, silent in the way towns and cities aren‚Äôt supposed to be. No birds. No wind through wires. Just that wet, soft, shff shff of our boots through slush.

We didn‚Äôt speak much.

We found a collapsed building with burned siding and a half-buried sign. Russian letters still intact, –£–ß–ï–ë–ù–´–ô –ö–û–†–ü–£–°. Maybe a school once? The air inside was stale, but not frozen. Like the cold didn‚Äôt fully want to enter.

We found nothing of use. Just desks, broken chairs, and a room filled with ruined books, water-damaged beyond recognition. Ajax picked one up and flipped through the pulpy mush anyway. Said it felt wrong to ignore them. We didn‚Äôt stay long. I kept thinking I heard a second set of steps, out of sync with our own. Just slightly behind. Just slightly off.

By the time we returned to the station, it was nearly dark. They didn‚Äôt greet us. Brighton was adding another log to the stove. Alex kept his eyes outside the window. Jimmy sat with his arms crossed. John didn‚Äôt look at us at all.

‚ÄúAnything?‚Äù Alex finally asked. I shook my head. ‚ÄúNothing worth freezing over.‚Äù He nodded. But the feeling of tension didn‚Äôt lift.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It started maybe an hour ago.

A sound too faint for most of us to notice at first. Not wind. Not creaking wood. Something under the floor. At first it was distant. A low grind or drag, like rock being shifted against other rock. Then it paused. Then it started again, slower, heavier and rhythmic.

Alex stayed silent. He had his notebook out and was writing equations or weather models or something, I don‚Äôt know. Brighton stood still with her hand against the wall, eyes closed. Jimmy moved away from the boards. Ajax didn‚Äôt. He just sat there, eyes wide, staring at the stove like he was trying to keep his breath from fogging the air too much.

A few minutes later we heard a thump, not under us, but outside. Not footsteps. An emergence. Like something was breaking the surface or being released\*.\* No one moved for a long time. We just listened. Then Ajax spoke.

‚ÄúThere was a hole,‚Äù he said. I hummed, in a questioning tone ""Back near the road. On the edge of town. When we were out earlier.‚Äù Why didn‚Äôt you say anything?‚Äù I asked. ""It didn‚Äôt look fresh. I thought it was just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat kind of hole?‚Äù Brighton asked. He looked very nervous, very‚Ä¶ unlike him. ""Not a crater. A tunnel. Like something‚Ä¶ dug out. From the ground.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe there are people here?‚Äù Jimmy said with hope.

Everyone‚Äôs quiet again now. The boards have stopped. But the quiet is too clean.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Again. This time, it wasn‚Äôt the wind or Ajax or the cold. It was the silence. Too silent\*.\* Like something just past the edge of hearing had paused to listen back.

I found Alex standing by the ticket office window. He hadn‚Äôt lit a lamp. Just stood there, arms crossed, watching the snow shift like sand under a frozen moon. We didn‚Äôt speak for a while. Then he said:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of days.‚Äù I questioned him on what he meant.

‚ÄúThe weather's closing. Not like a blizzard, not yet, but worse than before. The sky has lost all visibility. The snow‚Äôs layering fast. Temperatures are dropping below survivable margin. By the time of tomorrow, we‚Äôll be sealed in and frozen.‚Äù

I tried to convince him that we should ditch the town, that we could survive the trek back to the closest city. If we just try to leave, head West, maybe, hike blind.

‚ÄúWith John's ankle? With Jimmy as shaky? No. We'd die in half a mile.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt respond. Not for a minute or two. I just looked out the window where the snow drifted up against the broken and rusted gate. He doesn‚Äôt even make sense to me.

‚ÄúAlex,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong with this place.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúI know you want to think it‚Äôs just pressure, or cold, or isolation, but‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs something under us. Something real. I felt it tonight. In the walls. Under the floor.‚Äù He turned to me slowly.

‚ÄúWhat are you saying?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs something in those tunnels. People maybe? Something that‚Äôs still alive at the least.‚Äù

Alex looked tired. Older than he did yesterday. Like the math and maps weren‚Äôt working anymore. He tried convincing me I was sleep deprived and other shit, I wasn't having it ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm not.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing here, Josef!‚Äù He let out a sort of whisper yell.

I didn‚Äôt say anything after that. I didn‚Äôt want to. I think he was trying to convince himself more than me. But I did see his eyes flick toward the hallway where the hatch is. Just for a second.

I think he‚Äôs scared too.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We‚Äôve stopped pretending we‚Äôll leave soon.

It wasn‚Äôt said outright, no official vote or discussion, but we all knew by the time breakfast was over. The look Brighton gave the boarded window. The way John didn't bother checking his ankle. Even Jimmy didn't ask about leaving today. That‚Äôs how you know. We‚Äôre here. For a while. So we made a list.

Alex suggested we split up and check the buildings we haven‚Äôt searched yet, ""Properly this time,‚Äù he said. Not just poking around and hoping to find a dusty can of peas. Real searching.

We divided into pairs:

Alex and Brighton: heading east, toward the old residential row.

Jimmy and Ajax: toward what looks like an old medical outpost near the square.

John stayed behind, ankle still bad. Said he‚Äôd reinforce the window coverings and ration out the food we already have.

I went alone. Just for a bit. I needed the silence.

There‚Äôs a stillness in the town this morning that isn‚Äôt peaceful. Snow still falls, light, like flour sifted from the clouds, but nothing else moves. Still no birds. Still no rustle of wind. Not even an echo. The buildings groan sometimes, old wood shifting under its own weight. But that‚Äôs it.

Found a storehouse. Mostly rotted through. Inside were boxes of rusted tools, water-damaged paper, one tin of coffee long expired, and a dented can marked in Russian, ‚Äú–ú–Ø–°–û‚Äù. It was meat. Might still be good? I‚Äôll give it to John. He‚Äôll know what to do with it.

Passed the hatch on the way back. Still shut. Still wrong. Brighton says we should keep inventory of anything strange, sounds, smells, things moved. She‚Äôs starting to feel it too, I think. We‚Äôll regroup at noon and decide if we need to start burning furniture. The storm hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. I‚Äôm going to bed.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------John says his ankle is broken now. No hesitation, no fuss.

I believe him.

This morning he brushed it off, tightened his laces, and kept the pain behind his teeth. But now he can barely stand, even with the help of a chair and Jimmy‚Äôs makeshift splint. It is swollen bad, purplish and fat around the bone.

He tried to joke about it. He didn‚Äôt even laugh. ‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôm not going anywhere,‚Äù he muttered, like we were still pretending he might.

We weren‚Äôt.

Alex came back with scraps of dry wood from one of the abandoned homes. He said the wind was starting to twist. Not strong yet, but low, curling, like it‚Äôs being funneled in from every side. The sky looks bruised. Faint flurries started around noon and haven‚Äôt stopped.

The snow is falling even faster now.

Jimmy‚Äôs quiet. Ajax is jittery again. Keeps chewing the insides of his cheeks. We took stock of the food. We might have maybe five, six days left if we stretch it. Ajax found old crackers sealed in wax paper from what might‚Äôve been a military pantry. Brighton checked the old first-aid tins. Most of the meds are useless. One bandage is still sealed. Morphine vials cracked in the cold.

Then the radio turned on.

None of us touched it. We didn‚Äôt even know it WAS a radio. It looked like a broken comms box mounted in the far corner of the waiting room, corroded, half-covered by a dusty coat. It screeched once. Loud enough to make Ajax drop his mug.

It was saying something, definitely in Russian. It would say something for a second, then leave for a few more, then start back up again. The voice was warped like a recording played underwater. Too fast, too slow, skipping like a bad tape deck.

Then it cut off. Static. Silence. Then nothing at all.

No one spoke for almost a minute.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no power in that corner,‚Äù Brighton finally said. ‚ÄúNo antenna either,‚Äù Alex added. ‚ÄúThat box shouldn't even function?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. My head was pounding. It started a few moments before the radio came alive and hasn't gone away. A pressure behind my eyes, like altitude sickness but denser. And it's still there now, as I write.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sorry for the interruption. This part was really hard to write down, I might have missed a few words or got them wrong, his handwriting is really shaky and messy. I have class in 30 minutes, so I tried to get this entry down quickly as well.**¬†

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We lost Ajax.

We didn‚Äôt even notice.

He said he had to piss. Mumbled it, half-asleep, grabbing his coat with one arm while fumbling for a flashlight with the other. No one really acknowledged it. We were all crashing, heads heavy, fire low, brains fogged from hunger and cold.

Alex looked up briefly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go far,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Ajax said. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt come back.

We don‚Äôt know how long it was. Maybe twenty minutes. Maybe longer. I only noticed when the lights flickered, once, twice‚Ä¶ then died.

Everything snapped to black.

No more hum from the utility closet. No more stove heat. Just the wind outside, rising louder.¬†

I tried to pretend it wasn't real. The low shifting. Beneath the floor, like something dragging heavy limbs through gravel, slow and patient.

Alex was first to say something.

‚ÄúEveryone below, now!‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt argue. Just grabbed bags and flashlights, pulled open the hatch, and climbed into the dark. The stairs were steep. Stone and cold. Brighton counted us down to the bottom.

‚ÄúWait, Where‚Äôs Ajax?‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember who said it

But it hit all at once.

We shouted. Searched upstairs. Nothing. No tracks in the snow, the wind had swept everything away. No trail. No Sight. No sound.

Just‚Ä¶ gone.

Alex looked stricken. Not with guilt, I don‚Äôt think, but more like disbelief. Like someone had knocked the ground out from under his logic. Jimmy couldn‚Äôt sit still after that. He kept pacing. Mumbling. ‚ÄúHe was just here. ‚Äù Brighton whispered that he must‚Äôve gotten turned around. Maybe went to one of the other buildings? Maybe holed up to wait out the storm?

But I don‚Äôt believe that. I heard something outside when the lights went out. Not a scream. Just movement.

Final.

I think Ajax is gone.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs down here with us, if there is? But we‚Äôre in it now. The hatch is closed. The cold has sealed us from exiting, afraid of death.

It‚Äôs colder down here, deeper. I'm starting to wonder if this was a good idea at all.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It‚Äôs day 5 I think? I don‚Äôt remember. We are underground. And Ajax is still gone.

They‚Äôve all convinced themselves he‚Äôs holed up somewhere. Maybe in a house with a fireplace, maybe the old clinic. Maybe we‚Äôll find him when the storm clears. But I don‚Äôt believe that.

We turned the power on within the first hour of being down here. There‚Äôs a rusted breaker panel just beyond the stairs. Alex opened it like he already knew what to look for. Three switches. All clearly labeled in Russian: ""–°–í–ï–¢""\*, ""\*–û–¢–û–ü–õ–ï–ù–ò–ï""And ""–°–ò–°–¢–ï–ú–´ –ñ–ò–ó–ù–ï–û–ë–ï–°–ü–ï–ß–ï–ù–ò–Ø"".

He flipped all three. The lights buzzed like insects trapped in glass, but they came on, slow, flickering, loud. Then, the heat followed. Metallic and dry. It started circulating through ductwork that groaned for quite some time before settling into a dull hum. The warmth was instant relief, physical, at least. But the air down here is‚Ä¶ old. It was time to see what was down here.

# The Tunnels

They don‚Äôt look like maintenance corridors. They‚Äôre far more elaborate than that.

Concrete walls painted beige once, but long since peeled into cracked scabs. Red lines run horizontally at shoulder height, like guides. Every fifty feet or so, Russian stencils mark sections: –ó–û–ù–ê 1-–ê, –ó–û–ù–ê 2-–ë, –ê–†–•–ò–í, –•–†–ê–ù–ò–õ–ò–©–ï, and occasionally, –ü–†–û–°–ú–û–¢–†.

The ceilings are low enough to make John duck in places. Pipes crisscross above, wrapped in old thermal sheathing. Some are hissing gently, and others drip.

The smell is layered. It‚Äôs dusty, but like, dense and sterile, like powdered chalk. Oil and rust are prominent too, it attacks you like a sharpie you‚Äôve inhaled for too long. But underneath it all, something like wet meat left on metal, not strong enough to make me gag, but just enough to remind me how unwelcoming this place is. It‚Äôs always just a few degrees too warm. Enough to make you sweat if you stay in one place too long. The walls breathe, not literally, but the heat moves like a slow exhale, and it makes the rooms feel‚Ä¶ alive almost.

# The Rooms

We‚Äôve explored maybe six so far.

**Room A12**¬†‚Äì Some sort of records room. Inside has metal shelves lined with warped, rotted paper. Most of it is unreadable. One document sealed in plastic, labeled: –û–ü–´–¢ ‚Ññ17-–†: ""–ê–∫—É—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –∞–Ω–æ–º–∞–ª–∏—è"", It looks cool, like a secret document on something. We haven't opened it yet.

**Room A19 ‚Äì**¬†A bunking room? There are rows of thin steel-framed cots. Blankets stiff with mold. One cot has heavy straps bolted to it. Another had what looks like bite marks in the mattress. Not animal sized. Human-sized. Strange.

**Room B3**¬†‚Äì The Power room That‚Äôs where we got the heat and lights on. Still has a red phone mounted to the wall, tried it, it‚Äôs a deadline. Alex stared at it for a while.

**Room A4**¬†‚Äì Looks like an observation chamber of sorts? It has a one-way glass facing a small, empty cell. Dried blood smeared across the inner door. On the glass, someone had written, in black grease pencil, one word: ""–¢–ò–®–ò–ù–ê""We haven‚Äôt opened the double doors marked ‚Äú–ë–ï–ó–û–ü–ê–°–ù–û–°–¢–¨ ‚Äì –î–û–°–¢–£–ü –£–†–û–í–ù–Ø III –¢–û–õ–¨–ö–û.**‚Äù**¬†It has some sort of security thingy to it.

There are no windows. No clocks. Time isn‚Äôt a factor down here. The sounds echo in strange ways. Our footsteps come back wrong, late, sometimes too many. A cough from someone bounced off the walls and came back twice.

And then there‚Äôs this hum? Not the heaters, but something deeper. Subsonic. Like a far-off generator that isn‚Äôt part of the grid. We don't know how far the tunnels go. We‚Äôll keep exploring tomorrow.

They still think Ajax is waiting.¬† But I think something else is. And I think it's listening.

Me and a few buddies are urban explorers; something we enjoy doing a lot. We were exploring a rumored abandoned town in Russia. I don‚Äôt think it had a name, so it will be known as Vostok. Vostok is deep in the far east of Russia, nestled between large mountains and dense forestry. The closest city to it (which we were at previously to even get here) is 300km+ away; or 180 miles+.¬†

Being in subarctic conditions, suffice it to say; it was really flippin cold. Just landing in Vladivostok was enough for me to regret my decision to come. We heard about the town from a Russian internet friend. We had to pay some local to take us to the town, which was fine because he had us drink in his house and chat. We didn‚Äôt really have to pay him much, he was just happy to do something rather than sit around I suppose. He did question why we were heading there though, not sure why? We brushed him off.

Anyways, it actually was pretty difficult to get to the town. I know I haven‚Äôt really said everything or described why it was, but trust me, you‚Äôll find out why. When we got to the town, it was abandoned as we hoped. In fact, I didn‚Äôt believe anyone had lived there in decades. In our time exploring we found a notebook in a power station at the outskirts of the town. The door leading in the building was broken and, on the ground, with very large claw marks on it. I thought it was a bear, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I was wrong.¬†

We didn‚Äôt stay too long at the town as it had begun to blizzard.¬†*In hindsight, that was probably a good idea.*¬†I‚Äôll write down everything that is in the Notebook, from beginning to end. Maybe I'll give some thoughts during it, maybe not; there‚Äôs a lot to type, this might take me a few days to put together. Without saying too much, let‚Äôs just get into it.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Josef Markees. Me and some friends from my hometown got shit-faced and went for a late-night drive 3 moons ago. Our luck was not something we relied on. So, when our car broke down and we found ourselves stranded in the woods, surprise wasn't an emotion felt. John wanted to travel back to where we came from, but Alex, who wasn't entirely wasted (I blame him for our situation), said we were already too far out and would probably die trying.¬†

Whenever we all traveled, Alex liked being in tune with the locals. It was something he did so he could ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù or ‚Äútake in‚Äù the experience better. I'm sure it was just him trying to get laid. Having spoken a bit with the locals though, or, specifically one local, he heard about an abandoned town that shouldn‚Äôt be too far from where we were located. Apparently, he heard about it because of a local legend, I can‚Äôt recall what it was about. Something about Soviet Scientists & Military. I‚Äôm sure that the legends were mostly told by youth the more he talked about it.

We didn‚Äôt really have much of a choice since we were impaired and absolutely freezing. We brought clothes that would help us fight the bitter cold here, but the nighttime was a different story. We already had stuff in the back of the car. Some of it was rock climbing equipment (It was a fun hobby of mine), some of it was cave diving equipment from Jimmy and John, and the rest was different survival equipment since Ajax was deathly scared of dying out in the middle of nowhere‚Ä¶ like right now.

We couldn‚Äôt carry all of the equipment since there was a lot of it, but we grabbed enough. Alex and John lead the way with our half-charged flashlights. When I say it was painfully cold, it‚Äôs an understatement. Just the time it took to discuss what to do already left me numb and shaky. It only took a bit before reaching this secret. I didn‚Äôt even realize we arrived since it was so dark and there were zero lights on.¬†

Apparently, we had entered the building before I could think about how we were in the town.

I didn‚Äôt know until morning, but it was an old train station. I don‚Äôt know the last time it was in use; it doesn‚Äôt really matter. What did matter though was that the building had power. It was a very nice feeling to have. Inside was very dusty. Opening the door was very loud, I was glad there wasn't a crazy recluse waiting for someone to enter their abode and pounce. Alex and John quickly searched the building while the rest of us caught our breaths, disturbing the air to the brink of no recovery. After a bit, they came back and found an old heater that still worked in a break room.

The rest of the night was a blur, but we got through fine it seemed. In the morning, we all drank some water we had in the bags, which wasn't a lot, then discussed our plan. Brighton suggested that we could wait and wave someone down at the road, but Alex shut that idea down, saying there was only one road that led into the town and nobody drives over here. The group started trying to figure a way out. I couldn‚Äôt keep up since I drank so much last night and my head was killing me, so I went outside.

The sky was colorless and gray, like it has been since we got here. It was quite cold outside. Inside wasn't much better, but the old furnace sufficed. The town was very quiet. There was no smoke from any homes, no tracks on the ground, it snowed slightly over last night, but still. There isn‚Äôt even any birdsong or any sort of animals for that matter. Or people.

Before I could finish my thoughts that were running like a faucet, the group came outside. Alex said he and John were heading back to the car to check if it might be fixable, until then just stay about. Brighton warned them to be careful, that there might be some dangerous wildlife around. John jokingly said back ‚ÄúHe felt better in the wilderness than this town‚Äù, to Brighton's unamusement. Alex and John trekked their way back to the car, retracing their barely visible tracks. We all watched them vanish off in the distance before Jimmy turned and went back into the building, we soon followed as well.

For a bit, we all just sat in the lounge, Jimmy saying how insane all this is and Brighton talking about how stupid we were for getting ourselves in this situation. Me on the other hand, was still too tired to comprehend how boned we really were. After a while longer, Brighton suggested we all go out and explore this town. Everyone seemed fine with it, including me, but I stayed out to dance with sleep some more. They were ok with that and headed out, I went back into the break room where the heater was, and slept.

I woke up when the group came back, they weren‚Äôt exactly quiet. They told me about the town square, some houses, and a general store. It had some food in it, most of it was rotten, but there were frozen canned goods. Brighton described how most of the places were preserved pretty well, most of the houses were left like they had never been abandoned.¬†

Brighton began writing the layout on some old parchment paper while Jimmy rambled on about how uneasy he felt, like he was being watched. Druggies. Ajax was quiet mostly throughout our banter, like usual. A few minutes later, I stopped and realized that Alex and John hadn't returned yet. The rest of the group found it strange as well. I took a look outside and also realized that the sky was beginning to dark, how long was I out for?

We decided to wait longer inside the station, despite Jimmy‚Äôs protests. That was a good idea, because 30 or so minutes later, Alex and John did return. Alex had John's arm around his shoulder, John had twisted his ankle on the way back. He sat him down and relayed the info they got. ‚ÄúThe car's finished,‚Äù Alex said. ‚ÄúCompletely gone. Not just frozen, something's fried. Fuel‚Äôs no good either, thick, sludgy.‚Äù, ""Everything‚Äôs wrong with it,"" John added. ""It just... died\*.\* Like it wanted to.""¬†

Nightfall came quicker than expected, most of us remained quiet, with occasional suggestions of what to do, mostly shot down by rationality. We ate some protein bars and canned goods we had left over. It was a sad night. The Station grew darker and colder. The last thing I remember last night was Jimmy saying. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre stuck, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The night felt longer than the others. Maybe because the cold got worse.¬†

Maybe because of the footsteps.¬†

Around midnight, Brighton thought she heard someone walking outside. I also thought I heard it too. Slow steps, heavy. Crunching like someone dragging their boots deliberately. We checked the windows.¬†

No movement. No figures.¬†

I tried to laugh it off. It didn‚Äôt land. We waited longer, but heard nothing else. Brighton found a locked hatch in the main hallway. Steel and heavy. It was covered with a rug, one we definitely moved before, and somehow‚Ä¶ missed? Ajax said he didn‚Äôt like it. Kept saying it ‚Äúfelt off.‚Äù No one opened it. Not yet.

Something else happened.¬†

I haven‚Äôt told anyone.

I probably should‚Äôve.

I felt something. Tight. Heavy. Like someone was still standing just beyond the window outside.¬†

I had goosebumps all up and down my body, something I hadn‚Äôt noticed until Ajax pointed it out himself how he had some too.

I didn‚Äôt move. I just sat there, listening, barely breathing. Then I looked across the room. Alex was asleep. On the floor. His coat draped over him, hand tucked under his head. He didn‚Äôt move once. Brighton and Ajax were chilling together, drinking some hot drinks.

I didn‚Äôt dream of it. I don‚Äôt think I didn‚Äôt? Maybe sleep deprivation messes with you. Maybe the stress of the situation is getting to me a little bit. I feel too nauseous to think straight. I‚Äôm heading to bed again.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I woke up early again this morning. I think it‚Äôs 6 or 7 in the morning, can‚Äôt exactly tell. I wish we brung phones. Everyone was still asleep except Brighton. I checked the whole place and couldn‚Äôt find her. I went outside and past the hatch on the ground, it made my skin crawl like there were bugs in them. As I went to open the door, it opened itself. My heart flatlined for a few I‚Äôm pretty sure.¬†

It was Brighton.

She looked equally as scared by my presence. Laughing it off though, she mentioned how she had to use the bathroom. I noticed she had a nose bleed, and mentioned something about‚Ä¶ womanly things, she didn‚Äôt like that. She wiped the blood off her face with the hem of her sleeve, then walked into the Ticket Office. She called me into it and showed me a map on the wall.

She expressed her feeling of frustration working on the map outside while there was one in here the entire time. I laughed a little at that. The map on the wall looked pretty old and dated. It said some words in Russian, I don‚Äôt speak it, so much of it was just nonsense to me. It did have the date 1978 on it though. It clearly had the town's layout on it and some train routes.¬†

The train station had three tracks. One inbound that headed out to the West and East, the one East splitting into 2, one continuing East and one heading South. Under it it says something in Russia, then a date marked as 1986. I‚Äôm not sure what it is about. There is also a barely-visible overlay beneath the Station and extending East. More words I don‚Äôt understand, but there is an outline marked in red. One of the labels next to it was scratched out too.¬†

This definitely was not part of the Stations map, but later added or repurposed.

At the end of the rail lines, they all were marked with a red X. Two of them say something in Russian and one is marked with the number ‚Äú17‚Äù. In the top left corner of the map lay a faded railway seal. But in the bottom right, a smaller emblem, a five-pointed star with no text, almost like a branding mark. Possibly military, or internal security.

We stood side by side, studying that old diagram like it might change if we looked hard enough.

She pointed first, the red square beneath the eastern quarter of the town. No label, just thick lines, thicker than anything else on the map. Bold, permanent, like whoever drew it wanted to make sure no one accidentally missed it.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right under the station,‚Äù she said.

I added the fact that. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the one in the hallway, where we found the hatch.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

There was another silence. Comfortable, at first. Then not.

We compared the map to her sketches that she had drawn yesterday. At least two buildings marked didn‚Äôt exist anymore, she mentioned. One might have collapsed. One‚Äôs just... gone. Like it never was. The red square connects to a dozen smaller paths. One ends right beneath the administrative building. Another dives deep under the forest edge.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they built this town around the station,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúThey built it around whatever‚Äôs under it.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt talk after that. Just stood there, tracing lines with our eyes. Pretending as if we are uncovering something we‚Äôre not supposed to.

The others started to stir. The room was cold enough to see your breath again. I was still in the ticket office, Brighton leaning against the far wall. Neither of us had moved much. Ajax was first. Quiet, still bleary eyed. Jimmy sat up next, rubbing his face like he‚Äôd just had a nightmare he couldn‚Äôt remember. John didn‚Äôt say a word. Just checked his ankle, winced, and went back to pretending to be asleep. Alex met us in the hallway between the lounge and the ticket office. He could tell something had changed. Brighton gestured for him to come look.

We waited until they were all gathered. All of us stood around that aging map like we were reading a eulogy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more underneath,‚Äù Brighton said. ‚ÄúThe station, the town, it‚Äôs all built over something else.‚Äù ‚ÄúTunnels,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúStorage. Labs. Something marked in Russian\*.\* It‚Äôs all here.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt react at first.

Jimmy blinked hard. Ajax looked at the map, then at me, then back again, like he didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge it. John muttered something incoherent. Alex stayed quiet the longest. He kept glancing between the map and the hallway, like he was working through equations no one else could see.

‚ÄúYou think that hatch leads down into it?‚Äù he asked. Brighton nodded. ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why don‚Äôt we open it?‚Äù

No one answered.

Jimmy finally broke the silence with something that made everyone pause.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I think we‚Äôre not supposed to.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt being dramatic. His voice was low, resigned. Like he‚Äôd accepted it long ago and just hadn‚Äôt said it out loud yet. I looked back at the hallway. I couldn‚Äôt see the hatch from where I stood, but I swear I felt it. Like it was listening.

We didn‚Äôt open it today either.

But it‚Äôs there.

And it‚Äôs waiting.

The rest of the day was still. Strangely still. Like the town knew we‚Äôd found something and was giving us time to sit with it. No voices. No strange sounds. No shifting shadows or disappearing tools. Almost peaceful‚Ä¶ Almost.

We stayed indoors, rationed food, rotated who kept the fire stoked. Brighton redrew the tunnel map from memory. Ajax made tea that tasted like moldy cardboard, but no one complained. Alex spent a lot of time standing at the station‚Äôs front window, hands in his pockets, watching the sky. Late afternoon, he finally spoke up.¬†

‚ÄúThe pressure‚Äôs dropping fast,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTemperature too. We‚Äôre in for something bad. Maybe tonight. Maybe tomorrow.‚Äù No one questioned how he knew all this.

He didn‚Äôt say blizzard, but we all felt it behind his words.

Jimmy asked if we could hike out before it hit. Alex shook his head.

‚ÄúThe snow‚Äôs too deep now. Tracks are gone. Landmarks too.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what then?‚Äù John asked. ‚ÄúWait it out?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf it turns into whiteout conditions,‚Äù Alex said, ‚Äúthis station probably won‚Äôt hold enough heat to keep us alive.‚Äù

He looked at Brighton, then me.

‚ÄúThat hatch leads somewhere. If it‚Äôs insulated... shielded... it might be warmer below ground. At least long enough to survive the worst of it.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt want to say it. But he did.¬†

And for the first time, no one argued. We didn‚Äôt open it. Not yet. But we know now. If the storm comes, we‚Äôll go down.

God help us.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We left just before sunset. Ajax and me.

I didn‚Äôt ask for permission. Just told them we‚Äôd be back soon. Brighton looked up from her sketchbook and said nothing. John scoffed and tightened the blanket around his shoulders. Alex gave one of those long sighs that says more than words ever could. Jimmy actually said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù Twice.

I left anyway. I needed to move. Sitting too long with the same faces, in the same gray walls, breathing the same breath‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like the place itself starts to compress you. Ajax came without hesitation. I think he‚Äôs started to follow me because he doesn‚Äôt know what else to do.

We took the south path, past the broken post office and a blackened fountain. The town's still wrong, silent in the way towns and cities aren‚Äôt supposed to be. No birds. No wind through wires. Just that wet, soft, shff shff of our boots through slush.

We didn‚Äôt speak much.

We found a collapsed building with burned siding and a half-buried sign. Russian letters still intact, –£–ß–ï–ë–ù–´–ô –ö–û–†–ü–£–°. Maybe a school once? The air inside was stale, but not frozen. Like the cold didn‚Äôt fully want to enter.

We found nothing of use. Just desks, broken chairs, and a room filled with ruined books, water-damaged beyond recognition. Ajax picked one up and flipped through the pulpy mush anyway. Said it felt wrong to ignore them. We didn‚Äôt stay long. I kept thinking I heard a second set of steps, out of sync with our own. Just slightly behind. Just slightly off.

By the time we returned to the station, it was nearly dark. They didn‚Äôt greet us. Brighton was adding another log to the stove. Alex kept his eyes outside the window. Jimmy sat with his arms crossed. John didn‚Äôt look at us at all.

‚ÄúAnything?‚Äù Alex finally asked. I shook my head. ‚ÄúNothing worth freezing over.‚Äù He nodded. But the feeling of tension didn‚Äôt lift.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It started maybe an hour ago.

A sound too faint for most of us to notice at first. Not wind. Not creaking wood. Something under the floor. At first it was distant. A low grind or drag, like rock being shifted against other rock. Then it paused. Then it started again, slower, heavier and rhythmic.

Alex stayed silent. He had his notebook out and was writing equations or weather models or something, I don‚Äôt know. Brighton stood still with her hand against the wall, eyes closed. Jimmy moved away from the boards. Ajax didn‚Äôt. He just sat there, eyes wide, staring at the stove like he was trying to keep his breath from fogging the air too much.

A few minutes later we heard a thump, not under us, but outside. Not footsteps. An emergence. Like something was breaking the surface or being released\*.\* No one moved for a long time. We just listened. Then Ajax spoke.

‚ÄúThere was a hole,‚Äù he said. I hummed, in a questioning tone ""Back near the road. On the edge of town. When we were out earlier.‚Äù Why didn‚Äôt you say anything?‚Äù I asked. ""It didn‚Äôt look fresh. I thought it was just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat kind of hole?‚Äù Brighton asked. He looked very nervous, very‚Ä¶ unlike him. ""Not a crater. A tunnel. Like something‚Ä¶ dug out. From the ground.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe there are people here?‚Äù Jimmy said with hope.

Everyone‚Äôs quiet again now. The boards have stopped. But the quiet is too clean.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Again. This time, it wasn‚Äôt the wind or Ajax or the cold. It was the silence. Too silent\*.\* Like something just past the edge of hearing had paused to listen back.

I found Alex standing by the ticket office window. He hadn‚Äôt lit a lamp. Just stood there, arms crossed, watching the snow shift like sand under a frozen moon. We didn‚Äôt speak for a while. Then he said:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of days.‚Äù I questioned him on what he meant.

‚ÄúThe weather's closing. Not like a blizzard, not yet, but worse than before. The sky has lost all visibility. The snow‚Äôs layering fast. Temperatures are dropping below survivable margin. By the time of tomorrow, we‚Äôll be sealed in and frozen.‚Äù

I tried to convince him that we should ditch the town, that we could survive the trek back to the closest city. If we just try to leave, head West, maybe, hike blind.

‚ÄúWith John's ankle? With Jimmy as shaky? No. We'd die in half a mile.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt respond. Not for a minute or two. I just looked out the window where the snow drifted up against the broken and rusted gate. He doesn‚Äôt even make sense to me.

‚ÄúAlex,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong with this place.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúI know you want to think it‚Äôs just pressure, or cold, or isolation, but‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs something under us. Something real. I felt it tonight. In the walls. Under the floor.‚Äù He turned to me slowly.

‚ÄúWhat are you saying?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs something in those tunnels. People maybe? Something that‚Äôs still alive at the least.‚Äù

Alex looked tired. Older than he did yesterday. Like the math and maps weren‚Äôt working anymore. He tried convincing me I was sleep deprived and other shit, I wasn't having it ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm not.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing here, Josef!‚Äù He let out a sort of whisper yell.

I didn‚Äôt say anything after that. I didn‚Äôt want to. I think he was trying to convince himself more than me. But I did see his eyes flick toward the hallway where the hatch is. Just for a second.

I think he‚Äôs scared too.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We‚Äôve stopped pretending we‚Äôll leave soon.

It wasn‚Äôt said outright, no official vote or discussion, but we all knew by the time breakfast was over. The look Brighton gave the boarded window. The way John didn't bother checking his ankle. Even Jimmy didn't ask about leaving today. That‚Äôs how you know. We‚Äôre here. For a while. So we made a list.

Alex suggested we split up and check the buildings we haven‚Äôt searched yet, ""Properly this time,‚Äù he said. Not just poking around and hoping to find a dusty can of peas. Real searching.

We divided into pairs:

Alex and Brighton: heading east, toward the old residential row.

Jimmy and Ajax: toward what looks like an old medical outpost near the square.

John stayed behind, ankle still bad. Said he‚Äôd reinforce the window coverings and ration out the food we already have.

I went alone. Just for a bit. I needed the silence.

There‚Äôs a stillness in the town this morning that isn‚Äôt peaceful. Snow still falls, light, like flour sifted from the clouds, but nothing else moves. Still no birds. Still no rustle of wind. Not even an echo. The buildings groan sometimes, old wood shifting under its own weight. But that‚Äôs it.

Found a storehouse. Mostly rotted through. Inside were boxes of rusted tools, water-damaged paper, one tin of coffee long expired, and a dented can marked in Russian, ‚Äú–ú–Ø–°–û‚Äù. It was meat. Might still be good? I‚Äôll give it to John. He‚Äôll know what to do with it.

Passed the hatch on the way back. Still shut. Still wrong. Brighton says we should keep inventory of anything strange, sounds, smells, things moved. She‚Äôs starting to feel it too, I think. We‚Äôll regroup at noon and decide if we need to start burning furniture. The storm hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. I‚Äôm going to bed.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------John says his ankle is broken now. No hesitation, no fuss.

I believe him.

This morning he brushed it off, tightened his laces, and kept the pain behind his teeth. But now he can barely stand, even with the help of a chair and Jimmy‚Äôs makeshift splint. It is swollen bad, purplish and fat around the bone.

He tried to joke about it. He didn‚Äôt even laugh. ‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôm not going anywhere,‚Äù he muttered, like we were still pretending he might.

We weren‚Äôt.

Alex came back with scraps of dry wood from one of the abandoned homes. He said the wind was starting to twist. Not strong yet, but low, curling, like it‚Äôs being funneled in from every side. The sky looks bruised. Faint flurries started around noon and haven‚Äôt stopped.

The snow is falling even faster now.

Jimmy‚Äôs quiet. Ajax is jittery again. Keeps chewing the insides of his cheeks. We took stock of the food. We might have maybe five, six days left if we stretch it. Ajax found old crackers sealed in wax paper from what might‚Äôve been a military pantry. Brighton checked the old first-aid tins. Most of the meds are useless. One bandage is still sealed. Morphine vials cracked in the cold.

Then the radio turned on.

None of us touched it. We didn‚Äôt even know it WAS a radio. It looked like a broken comms box mounted in the far corner of the waiting room, corroded, half-covered by a dusty coat. It screeched once. Loud enough to make Ajax drop his mug.

It was saying something, definitely in Russian. It would say something for a second, then leave for a few more, then start back up again. The voice was warped like a recording played underwater. Too fast, too slow, skipping like a bad tape deck.

Then it cut off. Static. Silence. Then nothing at all.

No one spoke for almost a minute.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no power in that corner,‚Äù Brighton finally said. ‚ÄúNo antenna either,‚Äù Alex added. ‚ÄúThat box shouldn't even function?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. My head was pounding. It started a few moments before the radio came alive and hasn't gone away. A pressure behind my eyes, like altitude sickness but denser. And it's still there now, as I write.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sorry for the interruption. This part was really hard to write down, I might have missed a few words or got them wrong, his handwriting is really shaky and messy. I have class in 30 minutes, so I tried to get this entry down quickly as well.**¬†

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We lost Ajax.

We didn‚Äôt even notice.

He said he had to piss. Mumbled it, half-asleep, grabbing his coat with one arm while fumbling for a flashlight with the other. No one really acknowledged it. We were all crashing, heads heavy, fire low, brains fogged from hunger and cold.

Alex looked up briefly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go far,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Ajax said. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt come back.

We don‚Äôt know how long it was. Maybe twenty minutes. Maybe longer. I only noticed when the lights flickered, once, twice‚Ä¶ then died.

Everything snapped to black.

No more hum from the utility closet. No more stove heat. Just the wind outside, rising louder.¬†

I tried to pretend it wasn't real. The low shifting. Beneath the floor, like something dragging heavy limbs through gravel, slow and patient.

Alex was first to say something.

‚ÄúEveryone below, now!‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt argue. Just grabbed bags and flashlights, pulled open the hatch, and climbed into the dark. The stairs were steep. Stone and cold. Brighton counted us down to the bottom.

‚ÄúWait, Where‚Äôs Ajax?‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember who said it

But it hit all at once.

We shouted. Searched upstairs. Nothing. No tracks in the snow, the wind had swept everything away. No trail. No Sight. No sound.

Just‚Ä¶ gone.

Alex looked stricken. Not with guilt, I don‚Äôt think, but more like disbelief. Like someone had knocked the ground out from under his logic. Jimmy couldn‚Äôt sit still after that. He kept pacing. Mumbling. ‚ÄúHe was just here. ‚Äù Brighton whispered that he must‚Äôve gotten turned around. Maybe went to one of the other buildings? Maybe holed up to wait out the storm?

But I don‚Äôt believe that. I heard something outside when the lights went out. Not a scream. Just movement.

Final.

I think Ajax is gone.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs down here with us, if there is? But we‚Äôre in it now. The hatch is closed. The cold has sealed us from exiting, afraid of death.

It‚Äôs colder down here, deeper. I'm starting to wonder if this was a good idea at all.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It‚Äôs day 5 I think? I don‚Äôt remember. We are underground. And Ajax is still gone.

They‚Äôve all convinced themselves he‚Äôs holed up somewhere. Maybe in a house with a fireplace, maybe the old clinic. Maybe we‚Äôll find him when the storm clears. But I don‚Äôt believe that.

We turned the power on within the first hour of being down here. There‚Äôs a rusted breaker panel just beyond the stairs. Alex opened it like he already knew what to look for. Three switches. All clearly labeled in Russian: ""–°–í–ï–¢""\*, ""\*–û–¢–û–ü–õ–ï–ù–ò–ï""And ""–°–ò–°–¢–ï–ú–´ –ñ–ò–ó–ù–ï–û–ë–ï–°–ü–ï–ß–ï–ù–ò–Ø"".

He flipped all three. The lights buzzed like insects trapped in glass, but they came on, slow, flickering, loud. Then, the heat followed. Metallic and dry. It started circulating through ductwork that groaned for quite some time before settling into a dull hum. The warmth was instant relief, physical, at least. But the air down here is‚Ä¶ old. It was time to see what was down here.

# The Tunnels

They don‚Äôt look like maintenance corridors. They‚Äôre far more elaborate than that.

Concrete walls painted beige once, but long since peeled into cracked scabs. Red lines run horizontally at shoulder height, like guides. Every fifty feet or so, Russian stencils mark sections: –ó–û–ù–ê 1-–ê, –ó–û–ù–ê 2-–ë, –ê–†–•–ò–í, –•–†–ê–ù–ò–õ–ò–©–ï, and occasionally, –ü–†–û–°–ú–û–¢–†.

The ceilings are low enough to make John duck in places. Pipes crisscross above, wrapped in old thermal sheathing. Some are hissing gently, and others drip.

The smell is layered. It‚Äôs dusty, but like, dense and sterile, like powdered chalk. Oil and rust are prominent too, it attacks you like a sharpie you‚Äôve inhaled for too long. But underneath it all, something like wet meat left on metal, not strong enough to make me gag, but just enough to remind me how unwelcoming this place is. It‚Äôs always just a few degrees too warm. Enough to make you sweat if you stay in one place too long. The walls breathe, not literally, but the heat moves like a slow exhale, and it makes the rooms feel‚Ä¶ alive almost.

# The Rooms

We‚Äôve explored maybe six so far.

**Room A12**¬†‚Äì Some sort of records room. Inside has metal shelves lined with warped, rotted paper. Most of it is unreadable. One document sealed in plastic, labeled: –û–ü–´–¢ ‚Ññ17-–†: ""–ê–∫—É—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –∞–Ω–æ–º–∞–ª–∏—è"", It looks cool, like a secret document on something. We haven't opened it yet.

**Room A19 ‚Äì**¬†A bunking room? There are rows of thin steel-framed cots. Blankets stiff with mold. One cot has heavy straps bolted to it. Another had what looks like bite marks in the mattress. Not animal sized. Human-sized. Strange.

**Room B3**¬†‚Äì The Power room That‚Äôs where we got the heat and lights on. Still has a red phone mounted to the wall, tried it, it‚Äôs a deadline. Alex stared at it for a while.

**Room A4**¬†‚Äì Looks like an observation chamber of sorts? It has a one-way glass facing a small, empty cell. Dried blood smeared across the inner door. On the glass, someone had written, in black grease pencil, one word: ""–¢–ò–®–ò–ù–ê""We haven‚Äôt opened the double doors marked ‚Äú–ë–ï–ó–û–ü–ê–°–ù–û–°–¢–¨ ‚Äì –î–û–°–¢–£–ü –£–†–û–í–ù–Ø III –¢–û–õ–¨–ö–û.**‚Äù**¬†It has some sort of security thingy to it.

There are no windows. No clocks. Time isn‚Äôt a factor down here. The sounds echo in strange ways. Our footsteps come back wrong, late, sometimes too many. A cough from someone bounced off the walls and came back twice.

And then there‚Äôs this hum? Not the heaters, but something deeper. Subsonic. Like a far-off generator that isn‚Äôt part of the grid. We don't know how far the tunnels go. We‚Äôll keep exploring tomorrow.

They still think Ajax is waiting.¬† But I think something else is. And I think it's listening.

Watching younger guys make the same mistakes I did, so here's what I wish someone had told me before I learned it the expensive way:

1. Your appearance matters way more than you think. Used to think ""looks don't matter, personality is everything."" That's half true but personality matters, but nobody gets close enough to see your personality if you look like you don't care about yourself. Started lifting weights, buying clothes that fit, and getting decent haircuts. People treat you completely differently. Not fair honestly but I had to live with it.
2. Most career advice is terrible. ""Follow your passion"" and ""do what you love"" sounds nice but pays terribly. Better advice: get good at something valuable, then find ways to enjoy it. Your dream job might be a nightmare with a boss and deadlines. Build skills that pay well first, then pursue passion projects on the side with actual money in the bank.
3. Networking isn't about using people. Spent years thinking networking was fake and sleazy. Turns out it's just being genuinely helpful to people in your field. Answer questions, share opportunities, make introductions. Most good jobs come through connections, not job boards. The guy who helped me get my current role? Met him in a random conversation at a coffee shop.
4. You can't negotiate from a position of weakness. Whether it's salary, relationships, or business deals - you need options to have leverage. Stay in shape so you're not desperate for any relationship. Keep your skills sharp so you're not desperate for any job. Save money so you're not desperate for any paycheck. Desperation kills your negotiating power.
5. Clean eating changes everything .Used to live on pizza, energy drinks, and whatever was convenient. Thought food was just fuel. Started eating actual meals with vegetables and protein. Energy levels stabilized, sleep improved, mood got better, even thinking got clearer. You literally are what you eat - choose accordingly.
6. Your 20s are for building, not consuming. Watched friends blow money on cars, clothes, and experiences while I was learning skills and saving. They looked cooler at 25, I look better at 32. Your 20s are when you have energy but no money. Use that energy to build skills, relationships, and savings. The fancy stuff can wait.
7. Most people don't think about you as much as you think Spent years worried about what others thought of my choices. Turns out most people are too busy worrying about their own stuff to judge yours. That embarrassing thing you did last week? They already forgot. Make decisions based on what's good for you, not what looks good to people who aren't living your life.
8. Confidence comes from competence. ""Just be confident"" is useless advice. Confidence comes from knowing you can handle what comes up. Get good at things that matter fixing problems, making money, staying healthy, building relationships. When you know you can figure stuff out, confidence becomes automatic.
9. Your mental health affects everything else. Used to think therapy was for ""weak"" people and just powered through stress and anxiety. Finally got help at 29. Wish I'd done it at 19. Your brain is like any other part of your body sometimes it needs maintenance. Taking care of your mental health isn't weakness but maintenance.
10. Quality beats quantity in almost everything Better to have 3 close friends than 30 acquaintances. Better to own 5 high-quality items than 50 cheap ones. Better to be great at 2 skills than mediocre at 10. Better to have one meaningful relationship than a bunch of casual ones. Focus your energy on fewer things and do them well. I realized this after how my friend who hone his skill for a decade got a into a big internship after I have applied for it a lot of times.

I hope this helps. I just wanted you guys to learn this lessons. Took me so long and I want to preach it more. So you guys don't go through what I did.

1lkos8s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lkos8s,"Recognition Earned, Community Embraced","I have received the ""That‚Äôs Me"" badge 26 times. This occurs when a user applies a flair to their name in a community setting.

The flair has served a single, consistent purpose: to display my name clearly within the community environment.

My use of flair has remained consistent. I have applied it for clarity‚Äîto display my name alongside my activity in a way that is easy to identify.

The badge is awarded automatically each time this step is completed. Over time, that action has been repeated across different sessions.

The system records this kind of participation as part of its recognition structure. Reaching 26 instances reflects long-term use rather than a specific goal.

It does not require profile customization. It is based only on the use of flair‚Äîa basic visual tag connected to a user‚Äôs presence.

The badge is not rare. Many users have received it. Its value lies in how often it has been registered in a user‚Äôs account history.

This kind of tracking supports transparent records of interaction. It notes continued presence without emphasizing activity volume.

Consistency in flair usage contributes to recognition over time. It signals that the user has engaged with community tools in a stable way.

Although it is a minor feature, it forms part of the visible framework that keeps a shared space organized and user-friendly.

The badge itself does not alter how one participates, but it reflects one detail of how identity is maintained in community-based environments.

Having received it multiple times demonstrates repeated interaction with the system‚Äînothing more, nothing less.

This record stands as part of a broader pattern of participation, reflecting stable engagement across multiple communities.

I‚Äôm looking for advice or even suggestions how I can help her carry in with her healthy ways.

She‚Äôs about 5‚Äô4‚Äù maybe like 120 pounds. She‚Äôs not trying a significant weight loss just more around the tummy. It‚Äôs one of those things called ‚Äú relationship weight‚Äù and it was my fault apparently haha‚Ä¶ 

A little about her, she works at an emergency hospital for animals and it‚Äôs always busy so she never packs a lunch, it‚Äôs a lot of snacking in peanuts, chocolate almond Etc because there no time and that‚Äôs all she has for 8 -12 hours of her shift.  

And when she gets home she makes her first meal of the day and that‚Äôs it. It cook me rice or ramen, with a protein and that‚Äôs basically it

She loves white rice and will kill for it. So I we agreed to keep that the same for our diet. We have transition from pork and beef to more chicken and fish. This is also helping her health as she‚Äôs on accutane and red meat really screws with her bloodwork.

I have been pushing her to go in more hikes(every weekend) and runs (4 times a week) and trying to find healthy recipes every week to support her, We both agreed to limit her McDonald‚Äôs addiction haha‚Ä¶ to just ice coffee.

I been inviting her out to my runs 4 days a week, we hike every weekend.  And that‚Äôs probably the most work out tbh. 

Is there anything else I could do to help her?

1lkor1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lkor1n/the_dream_of_endless_golden_crosses_part_2/,The Dream of Endless Golden Crosses. Part 2,"Chapter 2:

Standing before the heart of the city, I stared into the golden glow of our fake sun. But it wasn't a ball of light when I first thought, the light goes on seemingly forever to each side. It's hard to tell if it's a mighty wall to protect what's inside, or a dome to keep something from escaping. It didn't stop me from entering nor leaving, the blinding light creates a challenge for the seeing if that's what counts as it's way to stop those who dares approach. Regardless of my sight or what this brilliant glow intent, I venture towards where my city should be. My footsteps were loud, being left in a deaf world makes creaks and rustle sound like thunder and earthquakes. My heartbeat was calm, beating like it should. But each pump feels like it could shake the world if the rhythm goes off even by a second. Even my breathing feels like it doesn't belong outside my lungs, my breath sounds like a hurricane ready to destroy no matter how slow I tried to exhale. I ponder if I should hold my breath but I do not believe in my ability to hold it so I tried everything I can to keep the storm calm with normal slow breathing. Giving up on my eyes to comprehend this strange world, I make my way towards the city center with the help of my hands. Hands with limited reach compared to the gift eyes give us every day that are taken for granted, feeling nothing till my eyes become of use when they make out an odd shape. It was a large shape, standing tall over my stature with ease. Even though this giant shape has been bathed in this warm fake sunlight, it feels cold when my outstretched hands close in. Mere steps away from one of the many questions I pondered, I can now confidently say what this strange shape truly is that has been plaguing my mind since the moment I first placed my eyes of its blurry misshapen form from afar. 
What stands before me is a golden cross.

*Gasp!!!* I woke up and shot straight up in my bed, covered in sweat and panting like I was holding my breath. 
‚ÄúAnother nightmare?!‚Äù I sat in my bed, pondering what had been haunting me last night. I was shaking with my hands holding my head, unable to think of what scared me other than I was scared. I need to get up and get ready, but I don't want to. There's been days, most days where I don't want to go but reason won me over. Today fear is winning me to stay still and not leave, I look at my clock that now says 7:34. I could easily make it if I get out now, but I don't want to. A memory of Rachel warm welcoming smile popped into mind, washing away any fear and doubt I had. Finding a reason to go to work, I got out of bed slower than usual. My morning went by quicker and in a total blur, I headed to the bathroom, shower, brushed my teeth, dress, ate breakfast and got ready to leave. I check my clock again which now says 8:06, I can still make it just fine. I took a second to reach for the door knob, not wanting to leave the safe place I needed to keep away the nightmare. I grabbed the door knob, and walked out into the new day, or into hell.
Walking down the familiar street I known felt wrong, as if I were being watch from the shadow. I feel exposed, I want to turn back and hide under the sheets of my bed, I don't want to be outside. I feel like there's hundreds of eyes on me and I hate it. I quicken my pace away from what hell is out here when my city should be. I might be going crazy now, I thought I saw a glow behind the buildings. That doesn‚Äôt matter now, Random Shack is up ahead, I went into a dash as fast as I could to go to my second home where I could hide away from the terror of which I neither know nor wish to know. Just a few more steps, just within reach, I reached for the door and forced myself inside and shut the door behind me and held it shut so nothing could come after me.
 ‚ÄúOh? Good morning Ethan! Quit the entrance today. Are you that excited for work that you ran all the way here? Or do you think sprinting to work till get you that employee of the month?‚Äù Rachel said cheerfully after being surprised from my sudden entrance. I didn‚Äôt hear her greeting, more like I couldn‚Äôt. I stood there trying to catch my breath and with the pounding of my heart made it impossible to hear anything, and honestly I really didn‚Äôt want to hear. 
‚ÄúEthan?‚Äù Rachel asked but to no answer. Failing to calm myself, the fear that was outside continued as I forced the door behind me to stay closed even harder the more I thought about it. Beads of sweat now falling off my chin then to the floor where I stared, now fearing that something might crash through the doors where I stood now became a greater concern. Legs feeling like jello and needing to run again crept into my mind, now begging to run away was what my entire body was shouting at me to do. I closed my eyes tightly, seeking courage to let go of the closed door and make a run for it, getting a last few quick breaths in for my mad escape before suddenly‚Ä¶..
‚ÄúEthan!?‚Äù Rachel asked again while putting her hand on my shoulder. I open my eyes to see Rachel right in front of me. It was so warm and soothing for her to be so close to me, probably the only other time she was this close besides when we first met and I shook her hand. Staring right into her beautiful blue eyes washed away any fear I had brought with me into the store. After what anyone would agree to be way too long to be staring at anyone, I regained my consciousness which felt like I had lost since yesterday and finally answered the concerned women right in front of me.
‚Äú...Oh, s-sorry. Yeah. I‚Äôm fine, just. Had a bad morning, that‚Äôs all. I-I‚Äôm fine, really, sorry for worrying you.‚Äù I‚Äôve said the most amount of words to Rachel in one go the entire time I‚Äôve known her, and slowly let go of the door with aching hands relieved to do so.
‚ÄúAlright, if you say so. Must be a terrible start to your day, then. You‚Äôre pale as a ghost and sweating like crazy. Either you saw a ghost, or you realized you were going to be late and were about to ruin your perfect attendance.‚Äù Rachel said, trying to cheer me up, and it worked. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much she could do to make me feel worse than just a few moments ago.
‚ÄúEverything alright over there? I heard the door being slam shut, and it‚Äôs way too early for that to be an angry customer storming out just yet.‚Äù Rick asked and he made his way from the back towards us.
‚ÄúEthan saw a ghost, or maybe he found a bug in his coffee? The scared little guy hasn‚Äôt said much, but I can‚Äôt help but to worry about what had spooked him this badly. He didn‚Äôt seem like the type to be scared this bad.‚Äù said Rachel.
‚ÄúWell it is true that you didn‚Äôt show up like usual, but you never really showed up looking like you found $20 on the street. Tell you what, you can grab one of my snacks from my secret stash and you can have 5 extra minutes on your break!‚Äù Said Rick now trying to cheer me up. Not nearly as effective as Rachel, but I still appreciate it.
‚ÄúWell aren't you lucky! Well, besides the whole having a not so pleasant morning, but Rick always has the best snacks. Maybe I should show up like you did to get me some free snacks! Everyone knows that college kids run off of snacks, coffee, and the cheapest meal plans we can find.‚Äù Rachel said like her usual cheerful self. 
‚ÄúLet me know if you need anything. And take it easy, it‚Äôs best if you put what happened earlier behind you. Ok!?‚Äù Realising that not only that I haven‚Äôt moved from the same spot this entire conversation, but this is also the longest I had ever been in a conversation. Still be it her doing most of it, but progress. Both Rick and Rachel headed to where they are needed, leaving me alone at the door made the isolation feel worse than ever. That fear never left, making it hard to do anything. I don‚Äôt know how long or how I even did it, I made it behind the register. I felt better by being in a place I know quite well for a little bit, but being left alone with nothing but your thoughts and fears didn‚Äôt make being here any better. 
Opening the store and letting the early birds in as usual, but I couldn‚Äôt recognize anyone coming into the store. I couldn‚Äôt make out anyone, everyone‚Äôs face and body just looked like messed mashed blobs with no color to them. I tried to look for the two people I knew but they were nowhere to be found in the sea of colorless shaped and distorted voices. I didn‚Äôt know if I was working or doing anything, everything just went by so fast that I really couldn‚Äôt comprehend if anything happened or not. I stared out into the store with passing blurs going in and out, trying to grasp onto anything that I could understand but I always end up at the same isolated spot where I sat as everything at the store moves on without me. The buzz above me was loud, louder then ever. It sounds more like the screams of the damn, I might actually be in hell right now. I was going insane but I didn‚Äôt say a word. I don‚Äôt know if it was either because I didn't want disturbed what‚Äôs normal left of the store, or if I physically couldn‚Äôt. What felt like seconds to minutes passed, I felt like something within me was about to snap when-
‚ÄúAlright, break time!‚Äù Rick said, patting my back and snapping me out of a trance I was stuck in. I don‚Äôt know how hours passed but I wasn‚Äôt worried about that, I now have an excuse to leave this suffocating prison for a chance to breathe.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you where I keep some of my good snacks if you wa-‚Äù
‚ÄúNo thank you!‚Äù I said rushing past Rick, probably too harshly. But at the time I didn‚Äôt care, I needed to get out of here. 
‚ÄúO-Oh, ok. Guess he‚Äôs not a big snack guy?‚Äù
Again I sat in a spot where I should be fine, where I should be comfortable. My usual spot where I smoke away my  first half of the day and get ready for the next. Thinking of what I could be doing instead of this, but not now. I sat with my knees to head in a ball feeling like I‚Äôm being watched all over again. A looming fear crawling back inside where it shouldn‚Äôt belong. Now I sat hopeless not knowing what to do or why this was happening. I wanted to disappear, me or whatever was out there to go away. I tried to pray but I couldn‚Äôt get the words out, or think if I was even going to say it properly. I held myself tighter wishing for all of it to go away till I heard the door open beside me.
‚ÄúEthen?‚Äù It was Rachel, someone I hadn‚Äôt realized I wanted to see but was so grateful for her to be there right beside me.
‚ÄúIs everything ok? You looked out of it the whole day and rushed out the moment you could. Clearly something is wrong and you‚Äôre not telling.‚Äù Rachel said as she made her way right next to me and sat quite close to where I‚Äôm currently curled up. 
‚ÄúYou may not like it, but you have people who would gladly hear your worries and help in any way we can. Rick is holding down the fort for now, so we have time to get anything off your chest if it‚Äôs really bothering you this much!‚Äù She really is such a sweet person, and honestly I‚Äôve been waiting for this moment forever, one moment with just the two of us alone together. One chance to be alone with the prettiest, kindest, and most lovely individual I know. Open up to her and form a bond that will grow stronger with time. To have both sides to truly know and understand the other‚Äôs struggles and joys, one which I‚Äôve dreamed and fantasized for quite some time. It would be so easy to tell her, so simple to say ‚ÄúI had problems sleeping‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been having the strangest day‚Äù anything. I didn‚Äôt even need to tell her the full story, one bit and she‚Äôll understand and comfort me the best she could. More than what I needed, but what I craved deeply.
‚Äú......I‚Äôm sorry Rachel. I‚Äôve probably worried both you and Rick today. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶.something I‚Äôm dealing with. I don‚Äôt want to get either of you to get involved. Thank you for worrying about me so much, I really do appreciate it.‚Äù Those words came out so easily, the most I‚Äôve said without fumbling my words. The most normal sentence I‚Äôve been wanting to be able to say to her, but not the words I wanted her to hear.
‚Äú......Ok Ethen. But if you ever change your mind and want someone to talk to, you have two pairs of ears who will gladly listen.‚Äù Rachel said as she stood up. Before heading back inside she gave me one more reassuring smile. Not the smile I wanted, but it still warms me from the cold isolation that surrounds me.
I waited until Rachel's warm smile could no longer keep away the cold and fear before heading back inside. I walked past Rick who seemed a bit worn out from dealing with the store all on his own. When he saw me he quickly changed his tired look to that of worried concern. 
‚ÄúYou good, Ethen?‚Äù you now when someone like Rick means what they say when there‚Äôs no jokes or puns to what they are saying. He always cares but only in times like this does he show it in full force.
‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm good. Sorry.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even look him in the eyes. I really felt bad for putting him through all of my crap, but I was still thinking about how I failed my one chance with Rachel that I couldn‚Äôt even properly say sorry to my only friend. I continued my way to the register, glad to know that one of the eyes that are on me are ones that I know and are glad that they are there. I was still paranoid and scared, but the rest of the day went on like normal. I could see the faces of the afternoon customers and I could hear their rants and sly remarks like usual. Time went by faster than normal, which I don‚Äôt know if it was a blessing or a curse. Both Rachel and Rick came by to check on me, I lied to them again and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù, keeping then at arms length for hopefully someones own good. End of the day was here and the three quiet employees of Random Shack did their last tasks of the day before closing.
‚ÄúOk Rachel, you can head on back and get some rest for school.‚Äù It‚Äôs not often to see Rick to act like a gentle father, but he would be a great dad to have growing up with.
‚ÄúThanks Rick, but I‚Äôll stay around for a bit. Gotta make sure everything‚Äôs alright, I think it‚Äôs best for me to stay just a bit longer.‚Äù Even the kind Rachel never asked to stay past her work hours, I must be one hell of a mess for her to go out of her way twice for someone like me.
‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs what you want, then I‚Äôll allow it. Just make sure you don‚Äôt do anything crazy, it‚Äôs already putting my boxers in a bind to make sure one of our employees is alright.‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Rick, I‚Äôll be out of the way.‚Äù Having Rachel in the last few moments of closing the store was a blessing I didn‚Äôt know that I wanted. She stood by the door quietly watching over me and Rick doing the last of the tasks for the night, asking if I needed help even though he still has stuff he needs to bo. I really do appreciate what both of them are doing, I wish I can return the favor in any way I can. With Rachel watching me work I didn‚Äôt get the sense of needing to look impressive or needing to be perfect in what I was doing when Rachel was there watching me, I just felt calm and at peace with her there. Like the sun peeking out over the clouds from a cold day to warm me up, probably the only time I enjoyed doing work in my life. After finishing the last of our nightly tasks Rick said his lines like a tradition that must be upheld, but with less enthusiasm then normal,
‚ÄúAnd with that, the Shack is closed.‚Äù No one can blame him for not ending off with a high note, especially me who caused the whole awkward problem. But I was kinda hoping to hear Rick's usual self before parting ways for tonight.
 ‚ÄúEthen. You're probably sick and tired of hearing this all day, but are you sure you don‚Äôt want either of us to walk you home. Neither of us mind for tonight, we‚Äôre more than happy to help in any way we can.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true. I may not have anything fancy or a magic spell to cast away your problem, but I‚Äôll gladly do what I can if you need it.‚Äù While it is true I was getting tired of hearing the same worried concerns the whole day, I did want to stay with them just a bit longer. Away from the impending fear I can‚Äôt bare to face, the unknown that haunts me. I so desperately want the three of us to be here as long as I can, but today my mouth and body refuse to listen to me, almost like it doesn't understand what‚Äôs about to happen when I leave the only pillars I can lean on.
‚ÄúThanks you two. I really do appreciate you saying that. But I‚Äôll be fine, I don‚Äôt live too far from here. I‚Äôll be home in no time. You guys head home and get some rest. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be back to normal by tomorrow.‚Äù That last bit was a lie, I knew that was a lie yet I still said it. I said so many lies today I might as well name a new sin after me. I hate it, and I don‚Äôt understand why I did that. I don‚Äôt want to leave, I don‚Äôt want to go back home, and I know for damn sure that I wont be ok tomorrow, if I can make it to tomorrow. Both Rick and Rachel looked at each other then looked back at me knowing there‚Äôs no point in arguing and will let me be.
‚ÄúIf you say so. But if you change your mind, you know where I live, yeah?‚Äù
‚ÄúGoodnight Ethan, I hope a goodnight sleep will be what the doctor ordered.‚Äù I nodded my head then walked back home, I wished that of once they weren't such nice people and pressured me into saying what I been wanting to say this whole day. I didn‚Äôt look back, I wanted to but I didn‚Äôt. My body refuses to look back on the only people who care, slowly feeling their warm pressens fade away as I walked further away till it‚Äôs fully gone. Now standing in front of what should be my home, feels alien. I‚Äôve never stood in front of anything that felt so unwelcoming. I made my way inside, how? I would like to know, my body has been doing everything all on its own to the point where I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if someone else was controlling it. I did my nightly duties in a trance, like my mind was still processing how I managed to walked through the front door. It‚Äôs only until I stood in front of my bed where I was able to move my body the way I wanted to, only to be replaced by fear. I curled up back to a ball right next to my bed, not wanting to move or know what was about to happen. I subconsciously turned off the light like I was about to go to sleep, but that‚Äôs the last thing I wanted to do. Deep down I know that if I close my eyes, the worse will happen. That be it I never awake again or something else was anyone's guess. All I do know is that I should get up, turn on the light and wait out the night. But fear has a stronger hold than reason, holding me down in that one spot in the dark. Like it knows what will happen if I close my eyes and sleep one last time. I tried to make a last ditch effort and force myself with everything I had to get up and out of the bedroom, but failed miserably as I slipped and bumped on the side of my bed. Somehow my face brushing against the side of my bed was enough for me to succumb to fatigue and tiredness, my eyes grew too heavy to keep open as I fell asleep on my bedroom floor and faced whatever was in store for me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.",1,1750905047.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

(it's ugly, but it tastes 'oh so goooood')

I've been making sourdough for 2 1/2 years and am trying to expand with a good black rye that is NOT like a brick or dry and bland.  
PLUS, I'm wanting to bake more from whole grain that I freshly mill.

I would describe the taste of this bread like caramel and rye flavour. It is similar to the taste of pumpernickel but lighter texture and doesn't need to be sliced so thin. It is a soft chew rather than chewy.

Ingredients:

14 oz warm water  
6 oz almost peaked fed starter (my starter is white flour base)  
16 oz finely milled organic rye grain  
4 oz unbleached all purpose flour  
.7 oz salt  
\--------------  
Ingredients added in first stretch and fold  
1 tsp sugar  
2 Tbsp neutral oil  
1 Tbsp instant coffee powder  
2 1/2 Tbsp Apple cider vinegar  
2 Tbsp black molasses  


Method: (I am not an expert, so I imagine those of you more seasoned bakers would have different more effective methods).   
Mix first set of ingredients until flour is incorporated and dough is shaggy.  
Rest 30 min, then add second set of ingredients and knead dough for 5 minutes.  
Rest 30 min, then stretch and fold BUT This dough does not stretch and fold (low gluten). The texture is like rough cookie dough, so I pulled and folded the dough as best as I could. The dough is not sticky at all.  
Rest 30 min, S and F gentler  
Rest 30 min, S and F very gently - some bubble activity was beginning.  
Rest 30 min, then shape and put into baking loaf pan (it does behave like regular dough though. Fresh milled flours are very different, whether wheat or rye). Place oiled plastic wrap on it so it doesn't dry out.  
Rest on counter overnight. (about 12 hours)   
I scored this loaf and a lot of the gas leaked out and it deflated, so I don't recommend scoring it.  
Preheat oven at 450 F convection. Bake covered 30 minutes. Then uncovered for 20 minutes (BTW, I baked this loaf uncovered for 20 and the edges burned, so I would say 15 minutes is better depending on your oven) ALSO, I placed a piece of foil shiny side down to prevent the bottom from burning - again, this is how my oven works.

He always treats me well, puts me first, and is loving. Family loves him, friends love him, we share most of the same values‚Ä¶ except something that I care a lot about is money. He claims to care about money but it‚Äôs not presenting this way.  I have been a hard worker since the day I could have a job. Saving up, never making large purchases, never had credit card debt. I am currently working with a master‚Äôs degree, often overtime. I want to buy a house and pay off my car before I am 30. However, my bf is still in school. He had a tragic event happen which caused him to take a year off and delayed his graduation. I had asked if he works during the semester, he said he would like to but had to see what his courses were like. He never ended up finding a job‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs now summer, he is working at a local company that a family friend found a spot for him at‚Äî essentially sits at a desk and plays on his phone. If overtime is offered, he doesn‚Äôt accept it. He used to buy coffee every morning, but stopped after I explained a $3 coffee a day adds up, especially when you‚Äôre on a limited income. He had $1500 in CC debt when I met him. I was able to educate him on CC debt (he didn‚Äôt understand that there is interest every month even if you pay the minimum payment). But he paid it all off as fast as he could using the money he earned from his winter internship. Nearing the end of this spring semester he ran out of money again, like $-0 in his account so he had to use the credit card. I feel like it‚Äôs a vicious, never ending cycle. He has most definitely improved since we met and he explains that his parents didn‚Äôt  teach him about money and saving. I am happy to teach but I fear when he eventually graduates and is working that this will become a bigger issue and his lack of wanting to work will cause fights. He will be graduating with over $160k in student loans. I graduated with $90k, put my head down and SAVED SAVED SAVED and was able to pay it off within 2 years, his plan right now is to pay the minimum‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm just stressed..I love him and truly don‚Äôt want to end a relationship over this; but do you think our different ideas of money, debt, how to save, what to spend on, and wanting to work will forever be an issue?

Is there any benefit to letting them degas before grinding, or would that just cause the coffee to lose flavor faster?

I tried these two today and both were alright. Tbh I haven't been knockin' any out the park recently, it's been kind of a struggle to dial all of them in. Washed coffees are always pretty tough, and there were quite a few, but I love a challenge. I enjoy trying any new coffee so I'm down regardless and happy to give anything a go. I love the practice and I'm happy even if they don't turn out great. 

I used the V60 for both with the same recipe. The only changes were going up two clicks for grind size and down three degrees (to 90¬∞c) for the Musumba. 

50g bloom, followed by 50g pours. 15g:240/250g.

I started out with a 23 setting on a c40 for the Prodigal, then tried again at 21 to see if that would make a difference and bring out any missing flavors. I kept the same water temp at 93¬∞C. I didn't have much luck either time. It wasn't the worst cup of coffee I've ever had but it didn't really taste like much.

The Musumba also wasn't bad, but again I didn't really taste much of a anything. Certainly not the tasting notes, far from anything resembling grape bubblegum, black tea, or dried prune. I've still got more of this one so I'll try again with maybe a different brewer and recipe. I'd love to get this one right because it sounds great. 

As for the huge boat explosion. I wasn't there today unfortunately but my coworker texted me and said it was pretty massive. Apparently a boat exploded and things got crazy.

Today, the dude behind me took offense and road my butt all the way around the corner and then performed a shitty couple of lane changes to end up in front of me before braking to bring me to a stop. 

\*I should note, I typically would tap the brakes here so my tail lights come on, but since the guy was so far up my butt I just took my foot off the gas and downshifted (but still only dropped to \~23 mph).

I shy away from confinement so I went around him, which pissed him off more. He then followed me as I made a few attempts to disengage, before finally leaving me be. 

The video is long, showing context up to the point of non-impact. For the fun stuff slide forward to 1:08. 

I can't say I behaved well myself, as once he became increasingly aggressive I did whatever made sense to keep my car infront of him with an open path of escape. I am surprised he followed me arround my u-turn, he really wanted to get out of his car and fight.

I'm glad no bystanders were caught in an accident. Thinking through now, I should have just stopped and waited for him to drive off. 

I don't have much of a description for him, rando skinny white dude wearing his rage on his sleeve. 

I do not like physical confrontations, especially when I have places to be and shit to do.

How do you overcome childhood trauma?

I myself has constantly being picked on, bullied when I was young. Plus my family always criticises me for every single thing, saying how bad I was compared to others. They tend to use harsh tone with me. And I feel frustrated and even to the extent of cursing them, and tell them to kneel down and apologise to me, which they never did.

Have a lot of bitterness as a result. So if I met someone who uses tone that reminds me of my parents, I will get triggered and lashed out. I have lashed out to people in public before, like taxi drivers and coffee shop owners. I am also being sensitive to being corrected or receiving feedback.",1,1750903572.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

Not only did that woman fuck up my life but the people around me who now have to support me through this time. I am not someone who lives at home and has minimal bills that can be jobless for months.

My husband, 14 month old son and I currently live with my husband‚Äôs grandmother. In her basement. With no windows. Which I‚Äôm fairly certain is not legal but that‚Äôs not the point here. We can‚Äôt afford to leave currently. 

We don‚Äôt live with her to take care of her. She‚Äôs an able bodied resident of this household. But this woman is the laziest, most conniving adult child I have ever met in my life. She has the most off the wall excuses for things. Can‚Äôt take responsibility for her actions. And cannot. read. a. room. to. save. her. life. 

Buckle up for the example situations which have actually taken place. 

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm not allowed to leave any counter top appliances plugged in. Want some toast? Gotta plug the toaster in first. Air fryer? Coffee pot? Nope. Plug em in to use em and yank that plug out of the wall when you‚Äôre done. The reason? *The outlet might catch on fire* TVs and fans and such are fine though? 

‚Ä¢ Need to use the counter to make dinner? Ahhh. That sucks. Thats where the food is stored because the cupboards are full of ???? stuff she ‚Äújust cant throw away‚Äù. Try to clean it up and organize it? It goes right back to the way it was immediately. So fuck me then. BUT the woman who filed for bankruptcy can have cleaning ladies come in and do exactly what I did and it‚Äôs acceptable. 

‚Ä¢ Her version of washing the dishes is rinsing the dishes, piling them on the counter, stove top, other counter, wherever she can find some space with water puddling all around and leaving them. 

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm the only one who washes the dishes but she has the fucking audacity to tell my husband to ‚Äúmake sure the dishes get done‚Äù while she‚Äôs on her umpteenth cruise of the year (remember the bankruptcy?). I lost my shit on my husband for that one. 

‚Ä¢ She‚Äôs continuously trying to be in the kitchen when you are. Making breakfast? Gotta move said dishes off the stove top and back into the sink! But NOW she wants to wash a pan for you to use even though you‚Äôre already using all the pans you need. 
     ¬∞BG (bankrupt grandmother): Are you sure
      you don‚Äôt need it? 
     ¬∞Me: Leave the pan where it is. It‚Äôs going to 
       be more in the way out of the sink. 
     ¬∞BG: well it‚Äôs just nice to have the sink clear 
      in case there is a fire
     ¬∞Me: *looks at my husband and laughs
       in pissed off*‚Ä¶‚Ä¶what
     ¬∞ Husband: to fill up a container..
YALL. does the sink not work if the dishes are in it?! Why is the first thought a fire?! 

‚Ä¢ Every week: trash day is tomorrow. No. Shit. It‚Äôs the same day every week. 

‚Ä¢ Sits creepily at the top of the stairs so she can stalk when I come up with my son and *SCREECHES* ‚ÄúHIIIIIIIIII‚Äù like she‚Äôs never seen him before and then tries to force him to give hugs and kisses. He pulls away EVERYTIME and she always says ‚Äúwhy do you always do this to me?‚Äù 

‚Ä¢I‚Äôm actively not giving her the time of day and she just keeps talking and then comes up right into my face and touches my shoulder with the back of her hand (and I fucking HATE that move. Get off me) 

‚Ä¢every damn meal that I make (which is basically every night) is ‚Äúdelicious‚Äù. It‚Äôs never any other description. It‚Äôs so disingenuous. 

Y‚Äôall I could go on for days. My therapist has told me she doesn‚Äôt know how I do it. My own grandmother, who loves everyone, has told me she doesn‚Äôt know how I do it. *I* don‚Äôt know how I do it! My husband and his siblings baby the hell out of this woman and it‚Äôs hella frustrating. She did essentially raise them; though I‚Äôm not sure how they all turned out ‚Äúnormal‚Äù since she‚Äôs got the attitude of a child and doesn‚Äôt know what to do if there‚Äôs construction or she falls for ANOTHER scam. 

I‚Äôm stuck with this woman. I would marry my husband 100x over but I am so jealous of people who have great in laws lol

Alot of people are so quiet. I walk into the residence hall and all the residence are quiet. If you say good morning, they may acknowledge it but alot of times they dont. People sit in quietness and every now and then someone will start a convo. It is not even because they are working alot of them, just dont believe in talking. 

When we are rounding, no one talks and just stay vilgente. I cracked a joke that with all this cardio, I will get abs in no time. None of the third years laughed. I can understand when it is time to talk to patient or when the docs are pimping us. But there are many times to just be a little less serious. Another thing I notice is that alot of them are scared to take coffee or bathroom breaks. A doctor could tell us to go back to the residence hall and they will just sit there scared to go downstairs for coffee and food. We litterally sat in silence for an hour waiting for the doctor. She told us that she was in end of life meeting so it could last a moment. The other med students still did not want to grab lunch. I was even told by one of them to not eat a sandwich instead get a granola bar. Bro it wasnt that deep lol.

I‚Äôm holding on to hope that maybe one school will say yes. (Internally sobbing.)

One rejection hit harder than the rest. A friend and I applied to the same program. She was accepted after an interview, while I was flat-out rejected without any contact. This school requires at least 1,000 PCE/HCE hours, but the average matriculant apparently has over 3,500.

For context:

\-I have 4,000 hours as a medical scribe in multiple specialties

\-1,800 hours as a dermatology medical assistant

\-Shadowing with PAs, MDs, and NPs

\-Consistent volunteering every weekend at blood drives and ED

\-Leadership roles at work

\-Took/retook prerequisites to stay competitive

\-Will graduate with an MPH this fall

Meanwhile, my friend worked as a scribe for about a year. No volunteer work. No additional PCE. No education beyond undergrad. I congratulated her recently and told her how proud I was. But what she told me next has been eating at me:

Her boyfriend (started dating a month after getting the scribe job)‚Äîwho‚Äôs a PA at her clinic‚Äîwrote her LOR and added 3,000+ hours of PCE, volunteer work, and shadowing that she didn‚Äôt do.

I don‚Äôt even know how to process that. I‚Äôve worked for years to build this application, and it‚Äôs heartbreaking to feel like honesty and integrity didn‚Äôt matter in the end.

Sunao has a reunion with an old friend


Morning in Tokyo was alive with motion‚Äîcars honking in the distance, people rushing past with coffee cups and briefcases, bikes weaving through alleys, the cacophony of an awakened city never quite still. Yet in the midst of it all, four figures moved with purpose, their steps calm but focused, as though they walked a world just slightly separate from the rest.

Kazuya kept his eyes on the shifting signs above the streets. His voice was low as he turned to his companions.

‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre lucky, we might find some of the local exorcists. Tokyo‚Äôs too big a hotspot for aberrations not to have a few stationed around.‚Äù

Kiriha, walking beside him in her casual form, yawned and stretched. ‚ÄúOr we could talk to the God of the Land. There‚Äôs bound to be at least one in a city this size. Might take some bribing though. City gods don‚Äôt do favors for free.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true,‚Äù Kotetsu said, arms folded and eyes scanning the rooftops. ‚ÄúBut time‚Äôs not on our side.‚Äù

Sunao, trailing a few steps behind with a slight frown, suddenly paused.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Actually, I might know someone.‚Äù

The group slowed as she came to a halt near the corner of a narrow street tucked between two looming apartment blocks. The smell of grilled sweet potatoes wafted from a food stall nearby.

‚ÄúI had a friend,‚Äù Sunao continued. ‚ÄúBack when I was still in the Servitude Faction. She was one of the few who didn‚Äôt judge me for how I trained or how strict I was with Kotetsu.‚Äù

Kotetsu blinked, surprised. ‚ÄúYou had friends in the Servitude Faction?‚Äù

She glared at him, but smirked a second later. ‚ÄúShe left the faction before I did. Transferred to the Partnership Faction, trained under Ouhi for a while. She was strong. Talented. Got her Eighth Sigil before me, actually.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Kazuya asked.

Sunao‚Äôs expression turned a little distant. ‚ÄúOur last conversation‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt great. She didn‚Äôt like the way I treated Kotetsu back then. Called me out. We had an argument, and I never saw her again. Her family moved to Tokyo not long after.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think she‚Äôs still here?‚Äù Kiriha asked.

Sunao nodded. ‚ÄúIf anywhere, it‚Äôs Tokyo. She used to love this place. Said it was full of spirit activity, and she liked the pace. Said it made her feel alive.‚Äù

Kazuya looked thoughtful. ‚ÄúIf she‚Äôs still active, she probably heard about the temple attack.‚Äù

Sunao‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúThen she‚Äôll know why we‚Äôre here.‚Äù

‚∏ª

30 Minutes Later

Navigating the back streets of Tokyo was like threading a needle through a thousand tiny mazes. Narrow alleys dipped into hidden shops, staircases led to unseen shrines, and vending machines buzzed softly next to walls covered in old talismans. Eventually, Sunao turned sharply onto a quiet side street lined with ivy-covered walls and small potted gardens.

And then they saw her.

A young teenage girl with light brown hair tied in a loose ponytail, dressed in a casual white blouse and fitted black slacks, stood outside a caf√© talking to a few locals. She laughed politely at something one of them said before turning‚Äîand her eyes met Sunao‚Äôs.

There was a pause.

Then a bright smile.

‚ÄúSunao?!‚Äù

Sunao smiled for the first time that morning. ‚ÄúAyame!‚Äù

The two girls closed the distance in a heartbeat and embraced, laughing. Ayame pulled back first, giving Sunao an appraising look.

‚ÄúYou look good. Stronger. You‚Äôve grown.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could say the same to you,‚Äù Sunao replied with a smile. ‚ÄúI made Eighth Sigil recently.‚Äù

Ayame‚Äôs eyes widened, then she grinned. ‚ÄúFinally! Took you long enough.‚Äù

Sunao rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYou beat me by, what, a year?‚Äù

‚ÄúStill counts,‚Äù Ayame teased, then looked over at the rest of the group. ‚ÄúSo. Who‚Äôre your friends?‚Äù

Sunao stepped aside. ‚ÄúThis is Kazuya Kagami, current partner of Kiriha‚Äîand the son of Kanaka-sama.‚Äù

Ayame blinked and looked at Kazuya for a long moment. There was no hostility in her eyes‚Äîjust curiosity. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre the famous Taboo Child, huh?‚Äù

Kazuya smiled awkwardly. ‚ÄúYup. That‚Äôs me.‚Äù

Ayame chuckled. ‚ÄúRelax. I don‚Äôt hold it against you. If you were good enough for Ouhi-sama to mentor‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre good enough for me. And you‚Äôve got Sunao with you, so that tells me plenty.‚Äù

Kazuya raised a brow. ‚ÄúYou already know why we‚Äôre here?‚Äù

Ayame‚Äôs expression darkened. ‚ÄúWord travels fast through the exorcist network. The attack on Tsuzura Temple? Everyone‚Äôs talking about it. Even the exorcists up north heard. The fact that a traitor and Curse Allies were involved‚Ä¶ that scares a lot of us.‚Äù

Sunao looked serious. ‚ÄúIt was Naoki Nanao. He sabotaged the defenses before the Curse Allies attacked. We‚Äôre hunting him now.‚Äù

Ayame nodded slowly. ‚ÄúI figured it was him. He always had that ‚ÄòI‚Äôll sell my own grandma‚Äô vibe.‚Äù

Kiriha snorted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong.‚Äù

Ayame glanced around and gestured for them to follow. ‚ÄúCome on. We should talk somewhere safer. There‚Äôs a teahouse nearby that doubles as an exorcist gathering point. If Naoki‚Äôs hiding in Tokyo, there‚Äôs a good chance one of us has seen him.‚Äù

The group fell in line behind her as they moved deeper into the heart of Tokyo‚Äîtoward alleys that buzzed with spiritual activity invisible to ordinary people, and toward the secrets waiting in the shadows.

Sunao glanced at Ayame and smiled softly.

The warm scent of roasted barley tea drifted through the quiet interior of the hidden teahouse tucked behind a small Shinto shrine. Despite its unassuming exterior, this place served as an informal meeting hub for exorcists stationed in Tokyo‚Äîneutral ground, where alliances were forged, rumors shared, and weary warriors found rare moments of peace.

Kazuya Kagami and Kiriha sat at a polished low table near the window, their cups steaming. The tea was strong and earthy, settling Kazuya‚Äôs nerves as he glanced across the room at Sunao, who sat with her back straight and arms folded, deep in conversation with her old friend Ayame. Kotetsu, in his human form, stood nearby, sipping tea cautiously as though unsure whether he was allowed to enjoy it.

Ayame gave Sunao a curious smile. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ I noticed something.‚Äù

Sunao blinked. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre treating Kotetsu‚Ä¶ differently. With respect, even.‚Äù She smirked. ‚ÄúNever thought I‚Äôd live to see it.‚Äù

Kotetsu raised a brow but didn‚Äôt say anything, quietly listening.

Sunao exhaled and looked down into her tea. ‚ÄúYeah. That‚Ä¶ changed.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? What happened?‚Äù Ayame asked. ‚ÄúYou used to treat him like a glorified tool when we were in the Servitude Faction.‚Äù

‚ÄúI did,‚Äù Sunao admitted, voice low. ‚ÄúI blamed him for things that weren‚Äôt his fault‚Ä¶ especially what happened to Suou.‚Äù

Ayame‚Äôs eyes softened at the mention of Sunao‚Äôs late brother.

Sunao looked up again, her voice more certain now. ‚ÄúYou can thank Kazuya for that.‚Äù

Ayame tilted her head. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Meeting him changed everything.‚Äù

She leaned back, the memories rising like mist.

‚ÄúIt started after I passed my final evaluation. I‚Äôd been offered the position of exorcist in my hometown‚ÄîKomiya‚Äîby Honoka. But I refused. Not because I didn‚Äôt want it, but because I felt I wasn‚Äôt ready. Not until I tested myself against the best.‚Äù

Ayame nodded slowly. ‚ÄúLet me guess‚Ä¶ you went looking for her.‚Äù

Sunao smirked. ‚ÄúExactly. I wanted to challenge the legendary exorcist in Kamioka‚Äîthe one who struck fear in aberrations across the land. I went searching for Kanaka Kagami.‚Äù

Ayame‚Äôs smile faded. ‚ÄúAnd didn‚Äôt find her, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. What I did find was her son who is also a clueless, wide-eyed rookie who barely knew how to fight.‚Äù

She glanced over at Kazuya, who raised a brow at her. ‚ÄúHe was trying to take on the role of exorcist in her place. Honestly? I was pissed. I couldn‚Äôt believe this was the one who inherited her duty.‚Äù

Kiriha snorted softly from across the room. ‚ÄúHe gets that a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut then,‚Äù Sunao continued, ‚ÄúI watched him fight.‚Äù

Her voice quieted, eyes distant with memory.

‚ÄúHe fought a Kamioni and didn‚Äôt back down. He‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt have the technique yet. But he had the heart.‚Äù

She smiled faintly. ‚ÄúEven then, I didn‚Äôt want to believe it. So I challenged him. To a duel.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Ayame leaned forward. ‚ÄúWho won?‚Äù

‚ÄúI lost,‚Äù Sunao admitted.

Kazuya, without looking over, added, ‚ÄúI kicked her ass.‚Äù

Sunao groaned. ‚ÄúShut up, Kazuya.‚Äù

Ayame chuckled. ‚ÄúBet you deserved it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI did,‚Äù Sunao said. ‚ÄúBecause I wasn‚Äôt fighting alongside Kotetsu‚ÄîI was treating him like a tool and burden. I wasn‚Äôt just losing to Kazuya. I was dragging myself down by refusing to change and accept my brothers ideals.‚Äù

Kotetsu blinked, then smiled faintly at her words.

She continued, ‚ÄúAfter that fight, he didn‚Äôt mock me. He didn‚Äôt hold it over my head. He helped me see the strength in partnership. And over time‚Ä¶ we got close.‚Äù

Ayame tilted her head. ‚ÄúClose, huh?‚Äù

Sunao ignored the teasing and added, ‚ÄúKiriha the one who told me the truth about Kanaka‚Ä¶ about what really happened. That she got possessed and Kiriha killed her to save his life and he had his memories sealed for a while.‚Äù

Ayame‚Äôs expression turned serious. ‚ÄúSo he became an exorcist out of wanting to prevent those he‚Äôs close too from being harmed by paranormals.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd to defeat his possessed mom,‚Äù Kiriha murmured, sipping her tea.

Sunao nodded. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs why I started training with him at Tsuzura Temple. We learned a lot and a bit about each other and he is especially more skilled and determined after he regained his memories. And when I was captured by a Curse Ally during the attack after I killed one to become eighth sigil‚Ä¶‚Äù

She looked at Kotetsu, then back at Ayame.

‚ÄúKazuya saved my life.‚Äù

There was a quiet pause as the tea steamed gently between them.

Ayame gave a small nod of admiration. ‚ÄúSounds like you‚Äôve come a long way.‚Äù

Sunao gave a small smile. ‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm not perfect. But I‚Äôm not the girl who punished her Tsukumogami for every mistake anymore.‚Äù

Ayame tapped her lip, then smirked. ‚ÄúAlright. Now I really want to see you two fight.‚Äù

Sunao blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on Red! Just a little duel. Like old times. I want to see how much stronger you‚Äôve gotten.‚Äù

Kazuya looked over. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt sparred since I got back from Yomi‚Ä¶‚Äù

Sunao crossed her arms. ‚ÄúYou still haven‚Äôt told me what happened there, by the way.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about this,‚Äù she said, smirking. ‚ÄúIf I win‚Ä¶ you tell me the whole story. No skipping details.‚Äù

Kazuya set down his tea, a glint of challenge in his eyes.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on.‚Äù",1,1750902903.0,tsugumomo,0,1.0,False

1lknurv,https://youtu.be/pbv9jT9kqBY,3 Very Scary TRUE Small Town Horror Stories,"# ""The Night Holcomb Changed"":

I live in Holcomb, Kansas, a small town where the wheat fields stretch endless and everyone knows your business. My house, a modest two-story with peeling white paint, sits across the dirt road from the Clutters‚Äô place‚Äîa big white farmhouse with a red barn, its silo poking up like a finger against the sky. Herbert Clutter and his family‚ÄîBonnie, Nancy, and Kenyon‚Äîare the kind of folks who wave at you from their porch, always at church, always lending a hand. But something happened on November 15, 1959, that‚Äôs got my hands trembling as I write this, and I can‚Äôt shake the fear that‚Äôs settled into my bones.It started the night before. I was in bed, half-asleep, when a car engine rumbled past our house, late, maybe midnight. It wasn‚Äôt loud, but it was wrong‚Äîtoo slow, too deliberate, like someone didn‚Äôt want to be noticed. My wife, Mary, stirred beside me, her voice groggy. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that noise? Sounds like it‚Äôs heading toward the Clutters‚Äô.‚Äù I propped myself up, listening as the growl faded down the road. ‚ÄúProbably just someone lost,‚Äù I said, trying to sound sure. But it nagged at me, that low hum lingering in my mind. I lay awake for hours, staring at the ceiling, wondering why it felt so off.Morning came, and I couldn‚Äôt shake the unease. I noticed the Clutters‚Äô old Chevy truck wasn‚Äôt parked outside the church. That was strange‚ÄîHerbert never missed a Sunday service, not in all the years I‚Äôd known him. Over breakfast, I mentioned it to Mary. She was flipping pancakes, her apron dusted with flour. ‚ÄúMaybe Bonnie‚Äôs feeling poorly again,‚Äù she said, her brow furrowing. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been fragile lately. Or maybe they had to visit someone out of town.‚Äù I nodded, but my gut twisted tighter. Herbert wasn‚Äôt the type to skip church without a word. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna walk over and check on them,‚Äù I said, pushing my plate away. Mary looked up, her eyes sharp. ‚ÄúYou sure? It‚Äôs probably nothing.‚Äù But her voice had an edge, like she felt it too.The walk across the field felt longer than usual. The Clutter place looked too still, the curtains drawn tight across every window. Bonnie loved her windows open, letting the breeze carry the smell of wheat inside. I climbed the porch steps, my boots thudding on the wood, and knocked on the front door. No answer. I knocked again, harder, my knuckles stinging. ‚ÄúHerbert? You there?‚Äù Silence. I tried the handle, and it turned easy‚Äîunlocked. My heart jumped. Nobody in Holcomb left their doors unlocked, not even in 1959.I stepped inside, the air cool and heavy. The living room was tidy, just like always‚ÄîBonnie‚Äôs crocheted doilies on the armchairs, a stack of Kenyon‚Äôs farm magazines on the coffee table. But it smelled wrong, sharp and metallic, like pennies left out too long. ‚ÄúBonnie? Nancy?‚Äù I called, my voice echoing in the quiet. A creak came from upstairs, faint but clear, like a floorboard under weight. I froze, my breath catching. I grabbed a fire poker from the hearth, its cold iron heavy in my hand, and called again, softer. ‚ÄúKenyon? Anybody home?‚Äù Another creak, closer now. My pulse hammered in my ears.I started up the stairs, each step groaning under my weight. The air got thicker, that metallic smell stronger. At the top, Herbert‚Äôs bedroom door was half-open. I pushed it with the poker, slow, and stopped dead. There he was, sprawled on the bed, hands tied behind his back with rope, his throat cut ear to ear. Blood soaked the sheets, dark and sticky, pooling on the floor. His eyes were open, staring at nothing, his face pale as wax. I stumbled back, my stomach heaving, the poker shaking in my grip. I wanted to run, but I had to check on the others. I had to know.Bonnie‚Äôs room was down the hall. I pushed the door open, my hand trembling. She was on her bed, nightgown twisted, hands bound tight with cord. Her throat was cut too, blood staining her pillow, her frail body still as stone. I choked, bile rising, and backed out, my boots slipping on the floor. ‚ÄúNancy,‚Äù I whispered, moving to her room. The door was cracked open, and I nudged it with my foot. She was there, sixteen years old, her long brown hair fanned out on the pillow. Her hands were tied, a bullet hole in her forehead, her eyes wide with terror frozen in place. I turned away, my chest tight, and headed downstairs, praying Kenyon was somewhere else, anywhere else.The basement door was in the kitchen. I descended the creaky steps, the air colder, damper. Kenyon was there, tied to a water pipe, his head slumped forward. A shotgun blast had torn through his skull, blood and bone splattered on the concrete. I gagged, dropping the poker, the clang echoing in the dark. Then I heard it‚Äîa creak, upstairs, slow and deliberate. My heart stopped. Was the killer still here? I grabbed the poker again, my palms sweaty, and crept back up, every step feeling like a lifetime. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù I shouted, my voice breaking. No answer, just another creak from the hallway. I gripped the poker, ready to swing, and kicked open the living room door. Nothing. Just the house settling, or so I told myself. I couldn‚Äôt stay. I ran outside, the air hitting my face, and sprinted home.‚ÄúMary!‚Äù I yelled, bursting through our door. She dropped a plate, shards scattering across the kitchen floor. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù she asked, grabbing my arm, her eyes wide. ‚ÄúThe Clutters,‚Äù I gasped, my chest heaving. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre dead. All of them. Tied up, murdered.‚Äù Her face went white, her hand flying to her mouth. ‚ÄúAll of them? Even Nancy?‚Äù I nodded, my hands shaking so bad I could barely stand. ‚ÄúCall the sheriff. Now.‚Äù She fumbled with the phone, her fingers slipping on the dial. ‚ÄúSheriff, it‚Äôs Mary,‚Äù she said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúYou need to get to the Clutters‚Äô place. Something awful‚Äôs happened.‚ÄùThe sheriff arrived in minutes, his patrol car kicking up dust. He was a big man, Tom, with a calm face that went grim when I told him what I‚Äôd seen. ‚ÄúYou sure about this?‚Äù he asked, kneeling beside me as I sat at the kitchen table. ‚ÄúYou see anything strange last night? Hear anything?‚Äù I told him about the car, that slow engine in the dark, how it headed toward the Clutters‚Äô place. He nodded, scribbling in his notebook. ‚ÄúStay here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go back. I‚Äôll handle it.‚ÄùWord spread fast. By evening, Holcomb was buzzing with fear. Neighbors crowded the general store, their voices low, eyes darting to the windows. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôd do something like this?‚Äù old man Johnson asked, his hands gripping a coffee mug. His wife, Ellen, clung to his arm. ‚ÄúSome monster,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúWhat if he‚Äôs still out there, watching us?‚Äù I felt it too, that cold dread crawling up my spine. Nobody walked alone after that. Women stayed inside, curtains drawn. Men started carrying rifles, checking their locks twice.A week later, I was at the store, picking up flour, when I overheard talk. Two men, Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, had been arrested in Las Vegas. They‚Äôd come to Holcomb thinking Herbert kept a safe full of cash from his farm. When they found nothing, they tied up the family and killed them, one by one. ‚ÄúFor nothing,‚Äù a woman beside me whispered, her voice shaking. ‚ÄúFour people, gone, just for a rumor.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe it‚Äîthe cruelty of it, the senselessness.The Clutter place sits empty now, the windows dark, the barn silent. I pass it every day, and every time, I feel that same cold grip in my chest. I hear that car engine in my dreams, see Herbert‚Äôs blood-soaked bed, Nancy‚Äôs frozen eyes. I check my locks three times a night, keep a shotgun by the door. Holcomb‚Äôs not the same anymore. We‚Äôre all different now, jumping at shadows, wondering who else might be out there, waiting.

  


# ""The Fire on Herron Road"":

I‚Äôve lived in Courtland, Mississippi, my whole life. It‚Äôs a speck of a town, barely 500 people, where the gas station doubles as the gossip hub and folks wave at every passing car. My best friend, Jessica, was the heart of this place. At 19, she had this glow‚Äîblonde hair, bright eyes, and a laugh that could pull you out of a bad day. We‚Äôd spend mornings at the gas station, sitting on the curb with cold sodas, her teasing me about my bad taste in music. That morning, she was her usual self, joking, planning a bonfire for the weekend. ‚ÄúGotta meet someone later,‚Äù she said, twirling her straw. ‚ÄúNo big deal.‚Äù Her smile was easy, carefree. I didn‚Äôt ask who. I wish I had.That night, my world broke. I was on my couch, half-watching TV, when my phone buzzed. It was my cousin, his voice shaking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Jessica. They found her on Herron Road, burning.‚Äù My stomach dropped. Burning? The word didn‚Äôt fit, like my brain couldn‚Äôt hold it. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I stammered. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs alive, but it‚Äôs bad,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre taking her to Memphis.‚Äù I grabbed my keys, hands trembling so hard I dropped them twice. The drive to the hospital was a blur, my mind racing. Jessica, burning? How? Why? I pictured her laugh, her face, and tried to push away the image of flames.At the hospital, the waiting room was cold and sterile. Jessica‚Äôs mom, Lisa, sat hunched in a chair, her face gray. Other folks from Courtland were there too, silent, eyes wide. I sat next to Lisa, my heart pounding. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I whispered. She shook her head, tears spilling. ‚ÄúThey found her walking, her body on fire. Her car was burning too.‚Äù I felt sick. Walking? Covered in flames? I couldn‚Äôt imagine the pain, her skin melting, her screams. Lisa grabbed my hand. ‚ÄúShe tried to say something to the paramedics. A name‚ÄîEric or Derek, they think.‚Äù My mind spun. Who was that? Nobody we knew matched those names.Hours later, a doctor came out, his face grim. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt make it,‚Äù he said. Lisa wailed, collapsing against me. Jessica was gone. Burns covered 98% of her body, they said. Someone had doused her with gasoline, set her and her car ablaze. I stood there, numb, my mind stuck on her last moments. To feel your flesh charring, to know you‚Äôre dying like that‚Äîit was too much. I drove home at dawn, the road empty, my chest hollow.Courtland changed overnight. The gas station, once loud with chatter, was quiet. People whispered, their eyes darting. ‚ÄúWho could do this?‚Äù an old man asked the cashier the next day. She leaned close, voice low. ‚ÄúSomeone here. Had to be.‚Äù I froze, my soda can sweating in my hand. Someone we knew? I thought of faces I passed daily‚Äîthe mechanic, the postman, the guy at the diner. Could one of them have done this? The idea burrowed into me, cold and sharp.Sleep stopped coming easy. My house, once cozy, felt exposed. Every creak made me jump. One night, walking home from the store, I heard footsteps behind me. Crunching gravel, steady, matching my pace. I turned, heart hammering, but the street was empty, just shadows from the streetlights stretching long. I walked faster, my breath loud in my ears. The footsteps started again, closer now, like someone was right behind me. I clutched my keys, their edges biting my palm, and ran. My house was a block away, porch light glowing. I fumbled the lock, slammed the door shut, and stood there, panting, listening. Nothing. No knock, no sound. But I didn‚Äôt feel alone.A few nights later, my phone rang at 2 a.m. I stared at the screen‚Äîunknown number. I answered, voice shaky. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Silence. Then breathing, heavy and slow, like someone holding the phone too close. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù I said, louder. The breathing didn‚Äôt stop. My skin crawled. I hung up, my hands cold. It happened again the next night, then the next. Always the same‚Äîsilent, deep breaths. I stopped answering. I unplugged my phone at night, but I still lay awake, imagining someone outside, watching.I visited Lisa a week later. She was on her porch, a cigarette burning between her fingers. Her eyes were sunken, like she hadn‚Äôt slept since that night. ‚ÄúI keep seeing her,‚Äù she said, staring at the yard. ‚ÄúWalking up, smiling.‚Äù I sat beside her, my throat tight. ‚ÄúLisa, what do you think happened?‚Äù I asked. She turned to me, her gaze sharp. ‚ÄúSomeone knew her. This wasn‚Äôt random. And folks in this town‚Äîthey‚Äôre keeping quiet.‚Äù I shivered. ‚ÄúYou think people know who did it?‚Äù She nodded. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre scared. Or protecting someone.‚Äù Her words stuck with me, heavy. Secrets in Courtland? I thought of neighbors I‚Äôd known forever. Could they hide something like this?The police worked the case, but answers were slow. Rumors spread like wildfire. Some said Jessica got mixed up with bad people. Others thought it was personal, someone angry with her. I didn‚Äôt believe any of it. She was kind, not the type to make enemies. But the name she said‚ÄîEric or Derek‚Äîhaunted me. I racked my brain, thinking of every guy we knew. Nobody fit.A year later, they arrested Quinton Tellis. I didn‚Äôt know him well, but I‚Äôd seen him around, quiet, unremarkable. They found his DNA on Jessica‚Äôs car keys, said phone records showed they‚Äôd been together that day. But his name wasn‚Äôt Eric or Derek. I went to the trial, sitting in the packed courtroom. Quinton looked calm, his face blank as witnesses spoke. They described the scene‚Äîgasoline on her clothes, her car a charred wreck. I gripped the bench, my stomach turning. The jury couldn‚Äôt agree. Mistrial. A second trial, same result. He walked free. I left the courthouse shaking, Lisa sobbing beside me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not over,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSomeone knows.‚ÄùIf it wasn‚Äôt Quinton, who was it? That question gnawed at me. I started noticing things‚Äîglances at the gas station, hushed talks that stopped when I walked by. One day, at the diner, a man I didn‚Äôt know stared at me too long. He looked away when I met his eyes, but my skin prickled. Was I imagining it? Or was he someone to fear? I stopped going out much, kept my curtains shut. My house felt like a cage, but outside felt worse.Years have passed, but Courtland‚Äôs still scarred. We hold vigils for Jessica, her picture on banners downtown, her smile frozen in time. Lisa keeps fighting, begging for tips, but the case stays cold. I don‚Äôt walk alone anymore. I check my locks three times, keep a bat by my bed. Sometimes, I wake up, sure I hear that breathing from those calls, low and close. I lie still, heart pounding, waiting for it to stop.The worst part is living with it. In a town this small, you see the same faces every day. The cashier, the neighbor, the guy fixing his truck. I smile, say hello, but in my head, I wonder: Was it you? Did you pour the gasoline? Did you strike the match? I picture Jessica‚Äôs last moments, her trying to say that name, fighting to be heard. I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll ever find him. But I know he‚Äôs out there, maybe watching, maybe waiting. And that fear‚Äîit‚Äôs part of me now, like the air in Courtland, heavy and impossible to escape.

  


# ""Seven Bridges"":

I live in Rocky Mount, a small town in North Carolina where everybody knows everybody. The kind of place where you wave at neighbors, and the caf√© I work at downtown feels like the heart of it all. I pour coffee for the same faces every day‚Äîfarmers, teachers, the guy who fixes cars at the shop on Main Street. It‚Äôs a simple life, and I liked it that way. Until Lisa stopped showing up.Lisa was my friend, a waitress at the diner across from the caf√©. She had this big laugh that made everybody smile, even on bad days. She‚Äôd wear this bright blue scarf, knotted loose around her neck, no matter the season. One morning, I popped into the diner to grab a muffin before my shift. Lisa wasn‚Äôt there. I leaned on the counter, chatting with her coworker, Betty, who was wiping down menus.‚ÄúBetty, you seen Lisa?‚Äù I asked, picking at the edge of a napkin.She shook her head, her face tightening. ‚ÄúNot for a week, hon. Her sister called yesterday, all frantic. Said Lisa didn‚Äôt come home after her shift last Tuesday. Nobody‚Äôs heard from her.‚ÄùMy stomach dropped. Lisa wasn‚Äôt the type to just vanish. She‚Äôd text me silly things, like pictures of her cat or complaints about rude customers. I tried calling her phone, but it went straight to voicemail. ‚ÄúLisa, it‚Äôs me. Call me back, okay? I‚Äôm worried,‚Äù I said, leaving a message. No reply.Days passed, and the worry grew heavier. At the caf√©, talk started turning dark. Jenny, my coworker, was refilling sugar jars when she leaned close. ‚ÄúYou hear about Seven Bridges Road?‚Äù she asked, her voice low. ‚ÄúHunters found a body out there yesterday. A woman, dumped in the woods off that dirt path.‚ÄùMy heart skipped. Seven Bridges Road was just outside town, a lonely stretch of gravel lined with thick trees. Kids dared each other to walk it at night, but it was mostly hunters and fishermen who went out there. ‚ÄúWho was it?‚Äù I asked, my hands pausing on the coffee pot.Jenny shrugged, her eyes uneasy. ‚ÄúPolice ain‚Äôt saying yet. But it‚Äôs the third woman gone missing this year. First Tina, then Diane, now Lisa‚Äôs nowhere. It‚Äôs not right.‚ÄùTina was a girl I knew from high school, quiet, kept to herself. She disappeared months ago, her car found empty at the edge of town. Diane worked the late shift at the gas station on Route 64. She went missing in the spring, her purse left behind the counter. And now Lisa. I couldn‚Äôt shake the thought of her blue scarf, her laugh, gone.That night, walking home from the caf√©, the streets felt too quiet. My sneakers echoed on the sidewalk, and every shadow made me jump. I passed the old hardware store, its windows dark, and felt a prickle on my neck, like someone was watching. I glanced back, but the street was empty. Then, under a flickering streetlight ahead, I saw a figure‚Äîjust standing there, tall and still. My breath caught in my throat. I crossed the street, my heart hammering, and hurried past. When I looked back, the figure was gone, like it melted into the dark.At home, I locked the front door, the back door, every window. I checked them twice, my hands shaky. I tried to sleep, but my mind kept replaying Lisa‚Äôs voice, her laugh. I pictured her walking home alone, maybe down a road like Seven Bridges. The thought made my chest tight.The next morning, I couldn‚Äôt sit still. On a whim, I drove out to Seven Bridges Road. I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking‚Äîmaybe that I‚Äôd find some clue, something to make sense of it all. The road was narrow, barely wide enough for my car, with trees crowding in on both sides. I parked near a bend where the gravel turned to mud and started walking. The air smelled of pine and damp earth. My sneakers crunched on leaves, the only sound out there. Then I saw it‚Äîa flash of blue caught on a thorny bush, half-hidden in the undergrowth. My heart stopped. It was Lisa‚Äôs scarf.I grabbed it, my hands trembling so bad I almost dropped it. The fabric was soft, frayed at the edges, just like she always wore it. ‚ÄúLisa?‚Äù I called, my voice cracking. I turned in a circle, scanning the trees. ‚ÄúLisa, are you here?‚Äù Nothing but birds chirping, far off. My chest felt like it was caving in. I ran back to my car, the scarf clutched tight, and drove straight to the police station.The officer at the desk was an older guy, gray hair, tired eyes. I held out the scarf. ‚ÄúThis belongs to my friend, Lisa. She‚Äôs missing. I found this on Seven Bridges Road.‚ÄùHe took it, turning it over in his hands. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll look into it,‚Äù he said, scribbling something on a form. ‚ÄúCould be hers, could be someone else‚Äôs. We‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù His voice was flat, like he‚Äôd seen too many scarves, too many missing girls.I left, but the scarf stayed in my mind. That night, I couldn‚Äôt stay home. The walls felt too close, the silence too loud. I went back to the caf√©, even though it was closed, just to feel normal. Jenny was there, mopping the floor. She took one look at my face and stopped. ‚ÄúYou okay, hon?‚Äù‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, my voice breaking. ‚ÄúI found Lisa‚Äôs scarf out by Seven Bridges. What if she‚Äôs‚Ä¶ gone?‚ÄùJenny set the mop down and hugged me, her arms tight. ‚ÄúPolice‚Äôll figure it out. They have to. This can‚Äôt keep happening.‚ÄùBut it did. A week later, another body turned up near Seven Bridges Road. Not Lisa, but another woman from town, someone who worked at the grocery store. The news spread like fire. At the caf√©, people huddled over their coffee, voices low. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a serial killer,‚Äù an old man muttered, his hands wrapped around his mug. ‚ÄúPicking us off, one by one. Cops ain‚Äôt doing nothing.‚ÄùWomen stopped going out alone. I started carrying a little can of pepper spray in my purse, checking over my shoulder every few steps. The town felt different, like a shadow hung over it. I stopped sleeping right. Nightmares woke me up‚Äîdreams of running down Seven Bridges Road, branches clawing at my arms, someone chasing me. I‚Äôd wake up gasping, my heart racing so fast I thought it‚Äôd burst.One night, I heard something outside my house. A soft scrape, like boots dragging on gravel. I froze in bed, holding my breath. Then came a creak, slow and deliberate, at my back door. Someone was turning the knob, testing it. My hands shook as I grabbed my phone and dialed 911, whispering, ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs trying to get into my house. Please, hurry.‚ÄùThe police came, their flashlights sweeping my yard. ‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs here,‚Äù the officer said, standing on my porch. ‚ÄúBut we found footprints in the dirt by your back door. Could be kids messing around.‚Äù His voice wasn‚Äôt convincing, and the way he avoided my eyes made my stomach churn.After that, I couldn‚Äôt relax. Every creak in the house, every rustle outside, sent my heart racing. I started keeping a kitchen knife under my pillow, just in case. At work, I‚Äôd stare out the caf√© window, half-expecting to see that shadowy figure from the streetlight watching me. Jenny noticed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre jumpy,‚Äù she said one day, setting down a tray of cups. ‚ÄúYou need to talk to someone. This is eating you up.‚Äù‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stop thinking about Lisa,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúWhat if she‚Äôs out there, hurt? Or worse?‚ÄùJenny sighed. ‚ÄúI know. I keep thinking about Tina, Diane‚Ä¶ all of them. Whoever‚Äôs doing this, he‚Äôs still out there.‚ÄùThen, one morning, the news hit. Police arrested a man named Antwan, someone from town. I knew him vaguely‚Äîhe‚Äôd come into the caf√© sometimes, always sat alone in the corner, sipping black coffee. They said he killed one of the women, the one from the grocery store. Maybe more. The town buzzed with it. At the caf√©, people crowded around tables, talking over each other.‚ÄúThink he got Lisa?‚Äù Jenny asked me, her voice barely above a whisper.I stared at the counter, my hands twisting a rag. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I hope not.‚ÄùAntwan went to prison for the one murder, but the police never closed the other cases. Lisa‚Äôs scarf sat in a plastic bag at the station, evidence of nothing. I never found out what happened to her. Seven Bridges Road stayed quiet, but I couldn‚Äôt drive by it anymore. The woods felt alive, watching. The town changed after that. We locked our doors, checked our windows, carried fear like a second skin. Every night, I listen for that scrape outside, the turn of a doorknob. Antwan‚Äôs in prison, but the questions never stopped. Was he the only one? Or is someone else still out there, waiting?",1,1750902416.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I've been a T1D for over 15 years now, and have been so fortunate to never have had a DKA incident until this week. My A1C has been hovering between 6.5 and 7 for several years, just doing MDI with a CGM. However, I was becoming frequently frustrated with highs in the morning due to the combination of dawn-phenomenon and work stress, overnight lows, having to remember to split-dose lantus am/pm, etc.

Back in April, I met with my endo and had the discussion about switching to a pump. I met with the diabetes educator a few weeks later to discuss options, and I was deciding between the latest Omnipod and the iLet ""bionic pancreas."" In the end, I decided to try out the iLet.

To be fair to the device, when it works, it works incredibly well! I've had days in a row with 95+% time in range, no ""high"" highs, and no readings below 70. However, when it isn't working, it has been catastrophically bad... For others that have used the device, I'm not talking about the initial few days where it completely under-boluses for meals and then is slow to correct them (after all, it needs to learn). 

I mean that the infusion set application seems to fail for one reason or another upon application (infusion piece separates from the applicator, tape doesn't stick so when I remove the applicator it pulls out the teflon insert, teflon insert somehow makes a ""J"" and squirts insulin onto my skin instead of in my body, etc.). Aside from needing new supplies, wasting insulin, wasting my time going through it again, this is not a big deal, just a minor annoyance. 

At the start of this week, I got up, replaced my insulin cartridge, applied my infusion set, and set off to work (I tend to skip breakfast). Around lunch my blood sugar was around 140 and steady, I was bogged down at work, so I just decided to have a protein snack and coffee. My blood sugar stayed in range, so I didn't think about it after that.

In the afternoon, I started getting really nauseous and vomited. I had eaten out the night before, so I thought it might just be a stomach bug. But then like clockwork, I started throwing up every half-hour to the point where I was just vomiting back any water I drank in-between and bile. My blood sugar was still in range (like 175), but I figured since I had an extra infusion set at work, I might as well replace it.

When I removed the set I inserted just that morning, I saw that somehow the teflon had become completely jammed up with blood, so it wasn't delivering any insulin to me. At this point, I realized I've gone almost 8 hours with no insulin of any kind. And, where I live is in a heat wave right now, so I realized I must be in the early stages of DKA. Retrospectively, I should have ketone test strips at the office, but I didn't.

I went ahead and tried to replace the infusion set and ... it failed to insert correctly! I then got a friend to drive me home, where I was able get an infusion set inserted correctly, and I bolused a fake meal in case I could still avoid DKA. Unfortunately, we've got a heat wave here, and with the vomiting and lack of insulin, I didn't get any better, and my urine started showing large ketones, so my wife took me to the ER. 

I'm all better now, and the pump is working. I feel traumatized by this experience, having gone so many years with no extreme side effects, this was just so unpleasant and scary. Initially when I started the pump, I was happy to see that it was doing as well as I was with MDI, but without (much) input from me (and I was told it would only get better over time as it learned).

Are these things even worth it? Did I just pick the wrong device or are pumps in-general prone to these problems?

Hoping to get some honest feedback and discussion, and any tips or tricks more experienced/smarter folks have had in this area.

Fast hitchhiking through NOVA. Slow as fuck... Actually, slower than fuck through Southern Virginia. Possibly not the most enlightened part of the country.

Day three, yesterday... If you've been following along, you know the hotel story...

Today...

Woke up this morning around 7:30. Out to the front desk to get some coffee and check washing machines. Coffee. Outside to smoke. Back in. Check washing machines. Open. Room. Backpack. Laundry room. You guys can probably work out what happened next.

Dining room. Cheese grits, strawberry banana yogurt, blueberry muffins. More coffee. Out across parking lot. Walmart accross street. Needed a new comb and some listerine. Got a tooth breaking into pieces and the nerve is exposed. Listerine seems to keep that painful mother fucker at bay. Also clove oil. Good stuff.

Back to hotel. Check laundry. Swap laundry into dryer. Room. Shave. Take super sexy dumb as shit tinder-style bathroom selfie. Out to smoke. Back to room to start packing gear. Laundry done and in pack. Box with backup vape bowl relocated to top of pack because I might have to swap it out soon.

Aaaaand it's checkout time. Gear up. Out across parking lot to gas station. Gallon of water. They don't take ebt. Machines won't read my debit card. ""How about cash?"" Water acquired. Solid twelve gulps to finish off current bottle. Out to onramp. Gear down. Thumb out.

""Hey!"" I look over. There's a black woman running toward the fence about fifty yards behind me with a gallon of water. I jog over to meet her. ""Here you go. You need this."" ""Thanks! I appreciate it!"" ""Your welcome!"" An hour goes by.

A woman pulls over. ""I'm not gonna give you a ride, but how about a few bucks."" ""That would be great."" ""Do you need a sweet tea?"" ""Definitely."" ""Here you go."" ""Thank you very much!"" "" No problem. I hope you find a good job."" 'Interesting.' 

Some time later I see a guy coming from a steakhouse directly behind the ramp I'm on. Waving his shirt around every couple  seconds. He walks all the way around the long fence and comes my way.

As he gets closer his hand comes up. My shoulders move about a quarter inch. Almost went into beat down mode. (""Back then if anybody started trouble we went and got Jerry (Garcia). He'd put 'em in thier place. And if they wanted to fight, well, he'd oblige them. -Some book I read years ago.) ""Here man. Take it. Just take it."" He hands me a drink. Walks past me up the onramp and disappears. 

Some douchebag in a diesel truck rolls coal coming down the ramp. I took the diplomatic route. I promptly walked over to the white line as he was getting closer, middle finger out, yelling ""Fuck you you inbread pussy piece of shit! Pull over you little bitch!""

Luckily the breeze was blowing so I didn't even smell any diesel exhaust.

About an hour later I see a guy coming down the off ramp opposite me on my side. No shirt. Shorts. Arms out imitating an airplane. He tilts his arms as he turns back and forth. Flies right across the ramp and back. Doesn't look for traffic. Zero fucks given.

Dude takes a wild route into the grass across from me on the onramp. A cop pulls up. Dude just walks around him when he gets out to confront him. Heads through the grass down the onramp. Cops goes back to his vehicle. Follows dude down the ramp. Pulls up in front of him.  Airplane guy dodges him when he gets out of his vehicle. Just continues to walk around him. Cop finally gives up and bails.

Dude turns around and comes right for me. ""I'm at the beach right now. This is fucking awesome! Hey. Can I have my cup back so I can get a refill?"" It's the same guy! How the fuck he took off one direction and came back from the other direction I'll never know. (Actually I do know. You're not dealing with morons here Lebowski.)

I knew dude was a little off when I met him earlier. Now I can see he's fuuucked up on something I've never done and probably don't know the name of. I give him his cup, the rest of my swet tea, and a smoke. He was lighting a cigarette butt with no tobacco and smoking that with no problem. He takes off and disappears.

Back to it. Thumb out. No shade. A few clouds. Light breeze. It's hotter than two puppies fighting under a blanket!

About three hours in an older black guy pulls over. We discuss the nightmare finding work is for both of us. He takes me about fourty-five miles south. ""I just realized we're in a storm warning right now."" ""Really?"" I check my phone. Sure enough. There's a thunderstorm about to hit. 

He drops me at a highway split. There's nothng here. This ramp is dead. I get the vape out. I'm giving this ramp about fifteen minutes amd I'm walking over to the other southbound onramp.

Car number eight pulls over. Twelve minute wait time. Gear up. Walk over. Dude gets out of his car to open his trunk for me. No questions. Just, ""Hey man how's it going?"" ""Better now."" He laughs. We get in. ""I'm going to Kenly."" ""Perfect. I know the place."" 

I regale him with traveling and boat stories. He tells me about trying to hitchhike recently. He lasted two days. He has a high amount of respect for hitchhikers.

Get dropped off at well known truck stop. Gear down. Sit on my favorite smoking bench. Smoke. Rain hits. Gear up. Inside.

Pepperoni and black olive pizza, and an orange soda. I start shivering. I just went from one hundred and one degrees to well air conditioned truck stop. It's raining so hard I can't see the pumps outside. Lots of thunder. 

Tent is setup in my usual spot...

A note: Just in case you're new to my writing... when I mention race it's to show that we're all people just trying to get along. It doesn't matter what race you are.

So I‚Äôm not even quite sure where to start. 15 years ago I met a man at a new job in a new city. As I was being introduced there was a single thought. I‚Äôm so f*ed. Ironically he wasn‚Äôt even remotely my type. Then not long after I realized it wasn‚Äôt just me. And he was struggling with all the same feelings. One day I was making a coffee at the machine and he asked me to grab him one too. I had never seen him drink coffee so I didn‚Äôt know how he took it but made it exactly as he would. I didn‚Äôt even think to ask. We both had some shock at that. Later he was coming towards me and I could see the look in his eyes and I backed up and ended up skidding across the floor and I told him no way, never could we do this. He thought it was funny. I had some genuine panic but not in a fearful way. More fearful of how I was feeling.

Well it happened anyway. We were those two people who when were in a building together everyone knows and all eyes are on us. But I was terrified (thanks historical experiences) of having a relationship. So we skirted around it. He met my family. But not as my partner. As someone who wanted to be as I pushed him away. We spent every moment together we could. Had really deep and intense days constantly. As I pushed him away and made it clear we couldn‚Äôt be he ended up married to someone else. Over the years and through me moving across the country now twice (I‚Äôm a gypsie looking for where I feel like I belong. It‚Äôs elusive and I‚Äôve come home now, close to where it all began) we have never been able to let go. The intensity of our relationship I guess you can maybe call it traveled with me and stayed strong. We would cut ties for a year here or a few months there and somehow one of us always gives it up and then the rest is history again. Talking like a moment hasn‚Äôt passed. Still missing each other. Still needing that bond. I know it‚Äôs not just me because no matter where we leave things he has come back to me more than I have to him.

He split from his wife for a while and found someone almost exactly like me. In nearly every way. And when it didn‚Äôt work he went back to his wife. He didn‚Äôt have the ability to go across the country and I don‚Äôt actually think he would?

I‚Äôm now a couple of hours from him. I have been for a few months. We talk. Almost every day. Neither of us has made a move to see each other but talk about when we do. I dream about this man constantly. And when I tell him about it he laughs and tells me it‚Äôs how he is now or something he does that I never experienced with him in the past. I haven‚Äôt seen this man in 9 years. Not a single time. But somehow there‚Äôs this teather that keeps us bound to one another.

I‚Äôm mad at him. He‚Äôs likely mad at me too. But I‚Äôm not sure I could live a life that didn‚Äôt have him in it? (No im not thinking of that in a literal sense. Just that I‚Äôm not sure I would be able to breathe)

Now that I‚Äôm fully ready he‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs back with his wife. I refuse to go see him because we have zero self control. At all. And he refuses to come see me for the same reason.

We also both have kids now. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I swear he‚Äôs my soul. I don‚Äôt know what this is. Or how to stop feeling this way. Move on. Leave him to move on. Yes she knows about me. She hates me. She‚Äôs known about me from the start of their relationship. And I‚Äôve always tried to be completely respectful and stepped aside when he told me about their new relationship. But at the same time he was hurt by me because I couldn‚Äôt give him all of me he said.

I know he‚Äôs not happy. And neither is she. They decided to get back together for the children. Until they are older. I refuse to wait for him for that many years externally but let‚Äôs be real, I have been waiting longer than that and will likely continue to because I can‚Äôt not have him. I hate this. I hate keeping each other at arms length as to not do something, because we know we will. Because we know nothing else exists when we‚Äôre in the same building let alone the same room. The air is charged when we are in a building. When we‚Äôre in a room it‚Äôs like a roar and it‚Äôs only us. Everyone turns to stare. Everyone. And people comment on it. Or they always did. And I know now is no different. The feelings have only gotten stronger on both sides.

What do I do? I know I could do a cord cutting or something but it‚Äôs never been bad. Never volitile, never messy. Only beautiful and intense and like an energy storm in a desert on the hottest of days. I don‚Äôt want to cause a landslide of events that would just be horribly bad. And I really don‚Äôt want to live life without him in some way. But I can‚Äôt even look at another man with even a hundredth the amount of need, love, passion. It makes dating feel kind of pointless. And unfortunately even the man who fathered my children only succeeded because I was too worn down to continue saying no.

And what is this? Seriously I don‚Äôt understand. And it‚Äôs not fair. Because it hurts. It hurts that it never is the right time. It hurts that it doesn‚Äôt work. It hurts that we can‚Äôt even be in each others presence without forgetting the world and only breathing each others air. It hurts that I miss him so much and live so close and can‚Äôt actually see him because I know I will hurt someone and also myself. Because we can‚Äôt actually be.

What on earth is this and what is wrong with me? And why is it stronger today than it was the day we met by a million or so times? Even after all these years apart?",3,1750902077.0,twinflames,1,1.0,False

I prefer that people try to be a little transparent about sickness esp icky contagious things like stomach bug and flu, strep, etc. i get that kids get sick especially when they are going to daycare. 

I have a close friend from undergrad (also 28F) who got married and had kids really young. She has no other friends with kids and her husband kinda irritates me. He will try to go golfing and then ask her to ask me to come over and help with the kids and the house/dog/whatever. She told me recently that she feels annoyed bc they feel left out from their childless friends / feel isolated. She said their other friends dont invite them anywhere anymore bc they dont find a sitter but also dont like to host. 

I invited her over recently and she came 2 hours late and barely communicated! which was annoying but she did have a car trouble so I kind of let it slide. She sat with me then dropped that her kid was sick and throwing up the whole weekend and the night before but then he was fine that AM so she decided she needed to get out of the house. That made me mad bc she like brought stomach bug germs the house without telling me. I was mega uncomfortable but I let it slide bc i wasnt going to kick her out of my house.

I DONT want HFM‚Ä¶ my patients dont want it, my coworkers dont want it. It is actually really contagious!!  It would be different if he was getting better and not freshly diagnosed and actively sick!

I kindly said I would need to back out of hanging at home and I feel really guilty but I dont like how she drops bombs about stomach bug and hand foot mouth as if it‚Äôs just the common cold.

Couple weeks go by and the socket heals and the headaches seem to be gone for the most part, but a few days ago I was at work, I hadn't drank any water that morning other than a cup of coffee and a soda and as I was finishing the soda I started getting a headache on my right side by my temple that felt like the mild dry socket headaches I got.

It came and went for a couple days but today I drank lots of water and haven't had any headaches but I can still feel a small tightness or pressure in my temple region that causes me anxiety and stress that it will start hurting again.

1lknnfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1lknnfy/from_could_improve_their_storytelling/,From could improve their storytelling,"This is not a call for cutscenes and linear narrative. 

I love environmental storytelling, and puzzle-box plots that place the onus on the player to piece things together.

But I believe it‚Äôs possible to maintain mystery and subtlety while also giving players a modicum more in terms of character and motivation to latch onto than From is currently providing. 

Look at games like Riven or Outer Wilds: these are entirely environmentally-told stories, where you‚Äôre learning from seeing the world and items in it and reading lore. But they also, if you put in the focus required to piece things together, tell stories that give you a sense of who cares about what, and what‚Äôs at stake for you. 

Look even at games like Shadow of the Colossus (and any other Ueda project), or Returnal, which are extremely ambiguous and elliptical but nevertheless give you a strong sense of character and motive. 

I have played well over 200 hours of Elden Ring. I have bought the coffee table books, watched the VaatiVidya lore videos. The game‚Äôs elaborate world-building clearly invites this kind of player effort and focus on the lore‚ÄîMiyazaki has talked about knowing people research and the company designing with that in mind. I don‚Äôt believe, in the end, that the game rewards the effort in this department the way it should. The vast majority of the time, despite really enjoying the fragments of lore the game offers, it never gave me a sense of why my character was trying to proceed, or what was at stake when I made choices. Sekiro, though I didn‚Äôt latch onto its linear design in other ways, even felt a bit more satisfying in this respect. 

It‚Äôs very easy to imagine a version of this game that just tells a slightly more intimate story that you play a slightly more active role in‚Äîwhile still keeping the archaeological approach and ambiguity. From has advanced virtually every other area of their game designs significantly since the first Demon‚Äôs Souls‚Äîexcept, really, this area. I hope they nudge their depth of storytelling forward too, next time.

Complex habit trackers with 20 different metrics. 5 AM wake-up routines that left me a zombie by noon. Elaborate reward systems that didn't help.

But at 38, something finally clicked. Not because I found some revolutionary new system, but because I stopped trying to be perfect and started being strategic.

What worked after  years of failing:

* Never miss the same habit two days in a row. That's it. Miss Monday? Fine. Miss Tuesday too? Not allowed. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system I've ever used.
* Minimize decision. I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Sounds boring? It's genius. Eliminating these micro-decisions preserves mental energy for the stuff that actually matters.
* I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. Here's the magic: 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once the initial friction is overcome. Starting is the hardest part.
* I attached new habits to existing behaviors. Stretching while my coffee brews. Reading while on the exercise bike. Planning my day while I eat breakfast. Stack new habits onto bulletproof existing ones.
* Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked, what didn't, and adjusting for the coming week. Most people set goals and forget them. I treat them like a GPS that needs constant monitoring.

This advice won't get millions of likes on social media. There's no dramatic before/after photos or miraculous 30-day transformations. It's just boring, consistent systems that compound over time.

The difference between my 20s and 30s is I stopped chasing motivation and started building systems that work even when I feel like garbage.

Just today, I get an email from the recruiter that he is sorry for the delayed response and that they are still interviewing candidates and hope to make a decision by the end of this month.

I've never heard of a company take this long but then again, it's a small team (team of 3-4 people she told me). Advice ?",2,1750901607.0,recruitinghell,2,1.0,False

1lknjf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/emptynosesyndrome/comments/1lknjf6/ohio_stdr_das/,Ohio st/dr das,"I did the research at ohio state yesterday and saw dr das for an injection today. This is a brief rundown of everything I did with a little reminder of what my case is like and my symptoms. 

I had emergency nasal surgery in 2008 after a bad break playing contact sports. In 2011 i had corrective surgery by a surgeon of my choosing. I lived a normal fufilling life until october 2024 when i swept concrete dust in my basement and got a heavy exposure. I was wearing an n95 mask and goggles but the dust was too fine and got through plus the mask wasnt sealed properly i would guess. The day i did the biggest sweeping which i refer to as the ‚Äúdust up‚Äù later that night i had snot profusely run down my nose and ringing in my ear(tinnitus) i slept it off and never felt the same after. It started with sinus pain and pressure headaches and i realized i no longer made mucus or boogers. I have had a slew of systemic issues. Tingling, nerve issues, joint aches, bone aches plus more systemic issues. 

At the ohio state ear and eye institute they do an ens research program. You get paid for it. It took 4 hours i was there from 11-3. The first thing you do is fill out questionaires basically like snot and ensq6 which i scored a 12 on. Then you do a smell test where you scratch cards and sniff them and tell them what you smell. I scored a perfect score on that although my smell is greatly reduced in my opinion. It was very strong odors like lemon or coffee or natural gas and very close to my face so i could smell them. I have trouble smelling stuff that isnt right next to my face now. Then we did an air sense test where they puff air into your nose at different velocities and i did not do well on this test and when they aimed at turbinate i scored 5/5 which is the worst you can do. I got some 2/5 on different parts of my nose closer to nostrils and front of nose. Then we did a breathing test where you breathe in and out when the computer tells you with electromagnets on your head. Finally we ended with a menthol test which i scored okay on but maybe slightly below what someone my age should. They also had you try these plastic nose plugs with holes in them that help vector air flow and they did slightly help me but not a lot and even after having them in for 10-15 minutes they felt uncomfortable to me but i could see how they can be useful for those who suffocate or are missing major volume. They had me answers questions on how helpful they felt on a scale. They emailed my results and all the scanned papers but i was overall happy to contribute.  They also did a ct scan and will make a 3d airflow chart but that takes a few months they said and to email and ask about it in a few months. 

Then today i saw dr das. I had a lot of documents with me and he read them over. They entailed blood work(not that important in my opinion), surgical report, ct scan from december 2024, my typed up report of what happened with the dust up in my basement and a typed list of 12 questions some being multi part questions. Dr das was very thorough and understanding. He took time to listen to my story, my woes, validated how i felt and how troubling this condition can be, and answered all of my questions. He then looked in my nose with endoscope and camera and deduced by estimation i have 60 percent or so of turbinate remaining in my right nostril and about 70 percent or so remaining in my left nostril. He said he could see scars and grey area in my turbinate and i saw it myself on the big screen that has camera was hooked up to. He seemed a little bit dejected at how resected my turbinates were as he knew one of my surgeons personally but i told him it could have been from my first initial emergency surgery over night in the emergency room at a hospital. Either way whats done is done and im trying to focus on gaining some relief now so he said he thought i was a good candidate for the prp/acell with adipose tissue graft(stem cell, obviously not expanded) so i elected to do it. They liposuctioned fat out of my hip and blood spun it in centrifuge and he injected it into my nose in various locations such as inferior turbinate, anterior turbinate, and middle turbinate. He also mentioned he would do septal wall or nostril or anywhere that looked like it needed help. On my left side i sneezed during it and i definitely bled some on both sides. He said that was a good sign and the injection took really well as it plumped up in the turbinate. He said i was a good candidate for healing as im a young(34) active still, healthy male. He said he was hopeful i would get some relief. He said 70 percent of his patients gain some sort of relief and 20 percent have dramatic improvment. I asked him how many of these hes done and he said thousands. So take that for what its worth. 

I had this injection about 9 hours ago and right now i currently feel swollen in my nose and i definitely have some moisture but it feels like how it feels when to like break your nose just without the pain aspect if anyones experienced that. Ive been mouth breathing a bit more than usual because of the swelling but overall i felt pretty good right after and now im feeling a bit more clogged than earlier. Im not in any real pain but i definitely dont feel like good or life changing after half a day. He gave me an analogy of how the injection may work. He likened it to how grass grows. In one week you dont notice so much and in 2 weeks maybe a little bit you notice but barely 3 weeks a little more 4 weeks you start to see some grass. He did say sometimes people feel better first 24-72 hours but once swelling goes down it then takes time for growth factors to work. He also mentioned he uses platelet rich fibrin now which has more growth factors than platelet rich plasma they previously used. He said he tweaks his formula and science every year or so or when more data comes out. As far as getting more injections and it compounding he didnt seem like he was too inclined to even speak on that now as hed want to see what kind of results i got from this one but he didnt think people needed too many shots in fact he said 2-3 would be the most someone would need before it wouldnt really be beneficial. Im supposed to email them in a week and tell them how im feeling. 

If anyone has any questions or comments please feel free to write them on here or pm i dont mind talking about it and it does not get annoying or bothersome to me. Im here to help anyone in this condition.

1lknj0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPOinPH/comments/1lknj0x/tips_for_applying_in_the_bpo_industry_part_2_job/,Tips for applying in the BPO Industry. Part 2 ‚Äì Job Hunting Hacks for Beginners.,"Hi Guys,

Hope my part 1 was helpful in preparing you to apply in the BPO Industry.

I will share some job-hunting hacks for beginners that can help you ease up the effort and even enjoy the experience. Let us start!

So, you are done with your preparation and now looking into which BPO company to send your applications and/or do a walk-in application.

**1**.¬†First to consider, your place of residence, Huh? Yes! It is important, here is why. Most of the job openings are all in the night shifts, travel is a bit more difficult compared to day shifts. We also need to save money on fares even if there are transportation allowances provided by the company.

Lastly, the farther and longer the travel time increases the risk of your personal safety and other incidents that can affect your punctuality. Worst case scenario, the chances of being a victim of petty crimes becomes high specially if you are residing with in the heart of the metro.

**2**.¬†Now, research all the names of BPO companies near your place of residence, I would say within a 0 to 2 hours travel time.

**3**.¬†After getting that, do a background check on each of the BPO companies. This will give you an initial information about the company, like work environment coming from current and former employees. Remember this, ‚ÄúNo BPOs are the same.‚Äù¬† As a company most BPOs have standardized corporate practices and general work culture and infrastructure. But 2 sites (offices) of 1 BPO company are not the same. Let me explain, each office has different sets of leadership and clients that form the overall work environment culture. So, it is important to read-up on feedback and reviews. You can do this by joining BPO social media groups like this subreddit, [Glassdoor.com](http://Glassdoor.com), Job Street, Indeed, Facebook groups, etc. This will also help you during your initial interview when asked, what do you know about the company. (Don‚Äôt ever mention any negative feedback that you read.)

**4.**¬†Next, go to each of their personal company recruitment social media pages, what you are looking for are the schedules of the following:  
**A.** **Open House:** ¬†On-site (office) One day/same day processing of applications. Yes! You hear it right, you will know your results, get a job offer and provide you your 1^(st) day of training schedule all in one day. Make sure you go in early, so you get in line first, finish early. Expect that it can take 8 hours or extended so you need to have lunch in between stages of your application, you will be guided accordingly by their recruitment team. **The Job description even salary packages are already mentioned on the invite.**

**Perks:** Free coffee, candies and sometimes snacks like cookies or donuts.

**B.** **Company Recruitment Caravan** ‚Äì Normally they do this in a hotel grand hall or event center.

What is the difference between this and the Open house? Company recruitment caravans are done for mass hiring for big accounts that are expanding or new clients that need to scale-up their processes, so they need a considerable number of new employees to cover their requirements in a short period of time. This is also a one-day/same day processing of applications. ***The probability of you landing a job here is high compared to the Open house and far better chances than sending online job applications***. The reason for that is, because there are multiple programs (clients) all in one roof with varying parameters and level of requirements.

**Example:**

You failed your job interview for a voice program, but your typing skill good and speed is high, your written exam are also high so you can be reprofile for a non-voice account like chat support or back-office work doing transcriptions or data entry type of work.

Once you submit your resume, recruitment will put you on a queue like a speed dating game where all applicants will be seated then called one by one to simultaneously take exams, go to their initial interview, or do speed typing test. All applicants will go through all the steps in no particular order. After that, all the results will be tallied. If you pass, you will proceed to the final interview. If you pass, they will give you a job offer and inform you your 1*^(st)* *day of training schedule.* ***Within this time period recruitment team will inform you via call/text or email regarding the details of your pre-employment requirements that you need to complete within the first week of your employment.*** Normally recruitment team will attach a small slip with a check list of what you need to submit for your pre-employment or given separately.

**If you did not pass,** your test results will be reassessed, and you will be put on queue to the next best program (client) and do the entire series again but this time using a new set of parameters from the next client. Normally the passing requirements becomes easier as some clients have lower level of skills required compared to others. This cycle can go on until you have been processed for all their programs. It can be exhausting so make sure you rehydrate.

**Perks:** Depending on the BPO company, there are freebies given away like tote bags, pins, pens and tumblers. Food, like snacks, free lunch and desserts like a chocolate √©clair or donuts. There are also deployed water refilling station to ensure all applicants can rehydrate.

**C.** **Online Zoom recruitment ‚Äì** This is not common but was famous during the pandemic. They will post job openings and will provide Online Zoom Recruitment schedules. On their announcement banner they will require to email your resume or click a link to fill-up and provide all requirements. then they will call or text you the Zoom details and Interview schedule. During the interview process it is expected to open your camera, you are properly dressed, with good lighting and a in quiet area. Online time-limited exams are also provided; you may be required to put a mirror behind you to show the reflection of your screen to avoid cheating recruitment will inform you ahead of time. This is also a one day/same day application process the only difference is that the stages are segmented. After your initial interview and exam, they will instruct you to wait for a call or text to sign back to the zoom meeting. ***Once you pass your final interview, you will be asked to go to the office for the signing of your job offer and provide your 1******^(st)*** ***day of training date, along with the submission of your pre-employment requirements.***

**D.** **Job Fair ‚Äì** This is your typical job fair with multiple BPO companies come together and participate. Most of the time it is sponsored by Jobstreet, other head-hunting companies or by the local government unit. Example: Makati Job fair 2025 sponsored by Lungsod ng Makati, Mayor‚Äôs office.

What to expect? There will be a lot of BPO companies with their own kiosk or booth. Normally you can see them set-up inside a mall‚Äôs general assembly area. Unlike the previously mentioned recruitment process, job fairs are crowded, and you might be standing the whole time while waiting for your interview or other stages of the recruitment process. Noise level is high that during interviews you might miss some details of the question, or the interviewer might ask you to repeat your answer. This is also a same-day processing application, however sometimes due to the limited space available some BPOs would only process you for an initial interview and exam then you might be asked to come in the office for your final interview and job offer. On average, if you come early and fail the interview, you can still fall-in-line to the next BPO company you like, and they will process your application.

**5.**¬†On a regular basis,  This is the default application route;

**A.**¬†¬†**Walk-in application** \- You go to their office, ask where the recruitment floor is and drop your application. This is by chance, meaning you spend money for travel but may not get process on the same day for an interview. They will schedule and ask to come back on those schedules including the final interview and job offer. To make it worth your while, most of the BPOs are situated in an area PEZA Zones like Alabang Cyberzone, BGC, UP Tech hub in QC. Silver City Tien de sitas behind Megamall so you can do a ‚Äútrail run‚Äù and submit your applications on all of these companies. In one building there are at least 2-3 different BPOs. You increase your chances of being interviewed the same day.

**B.¬†Classic online submission** ‚Äì You can directly go to their recruitment pages, go to job portal such as Jobstreet, BossJob, Linkedin etc.

**C.**¬†**Head-hunting firms** ‚Äì They are 3^(rd) party recruitment companies that assist you on your job hunting. Sometimes they can access your resume and contact information if you have a Jobstreet account and/or linkedin account. There is a bit of an advantage beginners because they will conduct a pre-screen process with you. They run similar assessments with you and advice you your strong points and gives you tips similar to what I am doing right now but face to face. They are like your talent manager and coach to increase your chances of getting hired. Though going through a head-hunter, the processing of application is lengthier than the rest.

***IMPORTANT: After your final interview you can ask when will be the results would come out, recruitment team with give you a date range. Make sure to follow-up through email if you have not receive a feedback after the date range have past.***

Hope this helps and I will see you on my next Tips for beginners Part 3: Job Offers and onboarding. Cheers! And God bless everyone!",4,1750901441.0,BPOinPH,0,0.75,False

1lknho6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dopabeane/comments/1lknho6/fuck_hipaa_my_director_forced_his_staff_to_go_on/,"Fuck HIPAA, my director forced his staff to go on a camping trip from Hell (1)","The heavy door destroyed any chance of eavesdropping, so I turned around. I briefly considered returning to my room, but I didn‚Äôt want to talk to Christophe ‚Äî not because I was angry anymore, just because I didn‚Äôt have the energy‚Äî so I wandered into the cafeteria and made the first of what would eventually be seven cups of coffee.

As the morning wore on, other staff trickled in. Most I recognized, although there were still a few that looked new to me.

I was just thinking how strange that was when Christophe came in. He saw me immediately, of course, and lost no time approaching. Larkin padded obediently at his side.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù I said stiffly.

‚ÄúI apologized to Merry,‚Äù he said without preamble.

‚ÄúThat fight last night didn‚Äôt sound like an apology.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is because I apologized after.‚Äù He hesitated. ‚ÄúI know he only wants you to be safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is true,‚Äù Birdy said.

‚ÄúI do not like him,‚Äù Christophe continued. ‚ÄúBut I know you are very important to him, and I know he is very important to you. It is not fair to be angry with him for that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great, Christophe, really, but I don‚Äôt want to have this conversation right now.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer. He just studied me, brow furrowed.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúGabriella is right. You look unwell.‚Äù His face contracted briefly. ‚ÄúStay here. I will bring breakfast.‚Äù

I watched him lumber to the counter as an intense and unexpected upswell of tenderness overwhelmed me. I looked down, carefully avoiding eye contact with Larkin, who fortunately seemed just as eager to avoid eye contact with me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Lark,‚Äù I murmured.

His ear flicked irritably.

A few minutes later, Christophe returned with food ‚Äî oatmeal and a banana for me, scrambled eggs and sausage for both him and Larkin.

It was difficult to eat, but I managed, due in no small part to Christophe‚Äôs laser-focus on my bowl.

Once I finished, he relaxed and took off for Ward 2. He leaned in. I knew he was going to try to kiss the top of my head, so I squirmed away. He left, looking very hurt and a little angry.

I poured myself another cup of coffee, then headed down to Ward 1 to begin my first appointment of the day, which was with King Mojave Green.

The second I stepped into his cell, I somehow knew the day would go off the rails.

It wasn‚Äôt Mojave‚Äôs fault. He was pleasant. More than pleasant ‚Äî he was actually excited to see me. But those feelings weren‚Äôt genuine. They weren‚Äôt even *him,* because he‚Äôs drugged out of his mind for safety‚Äôs sake. Second, he‚Äôs reptilian and requires warmth to thrive, but the Agency ‚Äî again, for safety‚Äôs sake ‚Äî keeps his cell at a temperature that slows him down both cognitively and physically to the point where he doesn‚Äôt even present a threat. As a result, he‚Äôs always happy and sweet towards me, and other staff for that matter. But that sweetness comes at the profound cost of his sense of self. The Agency forces him to be so much less than he truly is. Interacting with him is like interacting with a slow child now.

His behavior did nothing to dispel that notion.

He led me around his cell by the hand, pointing out the new additions the Harlequin had approved, including new plants and a replica burrow underlaid with a large slab of rock recently imported from his original home.

He wept with joy when he showed it to me. ‚ÄúI forgot what home felt like.‚Äù He took my hand and placed it on the rock. ‚ÄúNow I will never forget. Neither will you.‚Äù

I wept too, but not with joy. Only with guilt and grief. Leave it to the Agency to reduce a god with power over nature itself to a drunk toddler.

After that, I stepped into the bathroom to quickly wash my face, then went to the Bye Bye Mommy‚Äôs cell to help her and Dolly plan their adoption ceremony.

It‚Äôs going to be very small and simple (it has to be, given that the Bye Bye Mommy isn‚Äôt allowed out of her cell), but they‚Äôre both wildly excited.

‚ÄúMy favorite color is blue, and hers is yellow,‚Äù Dolly said. ‚ÄúSo we want everything to be blue and yellow!‚Äù

So we planned everything ‚Äî the decorations, the cake, even the dress code ‚Äî with that in mind. Mikey sat with us throughout, ready to step in and redirect if anything went wrong.

But nothing did, which came as no surprise to me. Both Dolly and the Bye Bye Mommy are still dangerous, but ever since they met each other, their worst behaviors and impulses have diminished or even vanished. This has substantially reducing their threat level. In addition, they‚Äôre grateful to me for suggesting their introduction in the first place. The Bye Bye Mommy even gives me credit for (in her words) ‚Äúfinding my daughter.‚Äù

Our appointment ended on a high note, with both of laughing and smiling. If you closed your eyes and listened, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell they were anything other than a normal mother and child.

Then Mikey and I went to see Isam.

He only recently recovered enough to be returned to his cell. Given my role in the injury that originally incapacitated him (to say nothing of my immensely powerful attachment to his injurer), there were multiple concerns about my safety. The Harlequin didn‚Äôt want me to see him at all, and Administration wanted it even less. But I insisted, and when (somewhat to my surprise) the Harlequin capitulated. Administration had no choice but to agree.

But I wasn‚Äôt worried. Isam is distant towards me and has been from the start, but he‚Äôs always polite. With the exception of the breakout, he‚Äôs never threatened me. He‚Äôs never even been rude.

And even if that had all changed, I wouldn‚Äôt have cared.

But it didn‚Äôt. When we entered his cell, he smiled politely and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything worth welcoming you to, but welcome anyway.‚Äù

It was a struggle to smile back. The toll his injuries took was hideously apparent, even all these months later. Isam has always been thin, but he was nearly skeletal now, with visibly wasted muscles and great dark hollows under his eyes. Scar tissue ‚Äî most of it faded, although some was still discolored and shiny with an almost gossamer sheen ‚Äî delineated skin grafts. Everything about him seemed bruised. Like he was bleeding just under the surface in every way imaginable.

He didn‚Äôt want to speak with me at any meaningful length, which was typical of his pre-injury behavior. But I did what I could, gently extracting information about his emotional and mental state to pass on to Charlie at the end of the day.

At the end, I asked, ‚ÄúBefore I leave, is there anything I can do for you?‚Äù  

‚ÄúNothing anyone here will give me,‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúBut thank you.‚Äù

The moment we exited his cell, Mikey blurted, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre talking about deploying him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, deploy him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean put him on a plane and fly him out to a war zone. Which one, I don‚Äôt know, but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs not a soldier!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I said,‚Äù he answered mildly. ‚ÄúWhich is when they told me that doesn‚Äôt matter, because he‚Äôs a weapon.‚Äù

Gunnar‚Äôs voice echoed in my head, poisonously pleasant: *Gods are always weapons.* ‚ÄúWho told you that?‚Äù

‚ÄúRafael.‚Äù

I wanted to hear more (well, what I actually wanted was to argue, as if yelling at Mikey would somehow force Administration to reverse course), but we were already running behind schedule, and we still had two major appointments.

The first of these was with Lore.

The purpose was to coordinate what is, unfortunately, a deathbed visit with his wife.

He‚Äôs been waiting months for this visit, but I‚Äôd only received final approval from Administration two days prior.

In the Harlequin‚Äôs defense, he‚Äôd personally approved the trip ages ago. However ‚Äî due to the fact that he finds minute details too boring to bother with ‚Äî he‚Äôd delegated arrangements to Administration, who weren‚Äôt exactly eager to comply, especially not with an inmate as dangerous as Lore. Even I‚Äôll admit they have their reasons. Lore has the capacity to be insanely unsafe, he‚Äôs beloved and essentially worshipped as a god in the tiny corner of the world we‚Äôre returning him to (however briefly), and his very presence in the Pantheon is considered an insult to New Olympus, who‚Äôd worked very hard to gain custody of him before the Harlequin ruined their plans.

For these reasons and a few others, Administration has come up with myriad delays and excuses ‚Äî everything from to using the current staffing shortage as a reason why they couldn‚Äôt spare enough agents for a security contingent to not having the resources available to construct a mobile containment system for Lore.

In any case, it's been a terribly long and deeply frustrating process, and it was a relief to finally be able to approach Lore with concrete plans and dates.

He listened wordlessly while I explained everything from the security measures and travel expectations to transport methods and timeframe.

He didn‚Äôt make eye contact once, which is unusual for him. So unusual, in fact, that it unsettled me.

When I finally finished, he said, ‚ÄúThank you. But why has this taken so long?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I answered honestly.

‚ÄúI could have had weeks with her. Months, even.‚Äù He finally looked at me. Immediately I shrank away.

Lore is beautiful ‚Äî distractingly beautiful, even disturbingly so. That beauty flawlessly masks what I consider blatant inhumanity. But fury broke that mask so thoroughly that for the first time I caught a glimpse of what he really is underneath.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù My voice faltered, and I hated myself for it. ‚ÄúIt was wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt condescend to me,‚Äù he snarled. ‚ÄúIf your agency believed this was wrong, it wouldn‚Äôt have happened. Which of you are coming with me? You, I assume. Who else?‚Äù

I stammered, ‚ÄúCommander Wingaryde, Agent Wolf‚Äî‚Äù Lore made a low, disgusted sound that reminded me of Star. For an awful moment I thought I was going to cry, but I managed to finish my sentence: ‚Äú‚Äîand a security team that‚Äôs yet to be assigned.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy, thank you,‚Äù he said contemptuously. ‚ÄúIs there anything else I need to know?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen leave.‚Äù

I hurried away, feeling unsettled, guilty, and above all ashamed.

But I had no time to indulge any of those feelings, because I was already late for my final, and most important, appointment of the week:

Jack and Asher.

They were meeting for the very first time. It‚Äôs been in the works for months. While no one on staff was (or is) entirely comfortable with it, everyone eventually agreed because it was Jack's idea. After everything he‚Äôs lost, we‚Äôre all loath to deny what little we can actually give him.

Initially, their visit was delayed because Asher had to achieve some degree of recovery, given that his condition upon capture was utterly appalling. But that time had come and gone. As with Lore, the ultimate delay had been on Administration‚Äôs end.

And that delay had finally resolved.

We made use of the time, though. Jack and Asher both received extensive preparation and counseling by Dr. Courtland, Dr. Vargas, and Charlie, all of whom were scheduled to attend the visit as well. I‚Äôd been involved somewhat, although not much; understandably, Jack‚Äôs been distant with me since his father‚Äôs execution. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll ever been undistant. I‚Äôm not even sure I care. I *do* care that my presence seems to make his life more difficult than it already is, so I try to be consistent without imposing on him. It‚Äôs all I can do.

For safety‚Äôs sake, the meeting was heavily supervised. While no one really expected Asher to harm us, Rafael rightfully refused to risk our safety, so in addition to overseeing the meeting himself, he assigned Mikey to attend as an emergency measure, along with Christophe, who was under orders to intervene in event of a disaster.

The meeting area was a large observation cell in Research and Development. When I entered, Jack and his team ‚Äî his support worker Cybele, plus Dr. Courtland and Dr. Vargas ‚Äî were already waiting.

Jack jumped when he saw me, only to immediately wilt with disappointment. I could tell he was painfully anxious and wildly excited at the same time, and practically thrumming with anticipation.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúHi, Jack. How are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù He stood up and stretched nervously. ‚ÄúIs he going to be here soon?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Any minute now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Good.‚Äù He sat back down. For the first time since we met, he looked almost healthy. Old, deep bruises and swaths of scar tissue blanketed his skin, but the visible signs of decay were gone, and even though one of his eyes was still mildly sunken, both were bright. I thought he looked wonderful.

I was on the verge of telling him so when the door hissed open.

Shadows came first, sweeping across the gleaming white floor. Their owners followed. Charlie came first, then Mikey, then Rafael.

Jack jumped every time, and actually leapt to his feet when Asher‚Äôs tall, winged shadow bled strangely across the floor, closely followed by Christophe‚Äôs distinctive silhouette.

When they entered the room, and Jack went very still.

We all did.

Even at his most withered and ruined, Asher had been awful and lovely in equal measure, like something from a beautiful dream souring into a nightmare. Now he was equal parts angel and monster, with no trace of humanity. He was radiant, light itself encased in skin, all muted fire and glowing gold. A bony crest had grown over his face, covering everything between the bridge of his nose and his forehead. He had no eyes, but didn‚Äôt need them, I knew; he sensed and saw everything through a dense, complex network of receptors in his skin.

The silence around us felt explosive, somehow. Like a gas leak waiting for a match.

Then Asher said, ‚ÄúHello, Jack.‚Äù

His voice was warm and almost musical, even gentle, but it broke the spell.

Jack shriveled, practically collapsing in on himself. And I knew why. However gentle it might have been, Asher‚Äôs voice was nothing like his father‚Äôs. *Nothing* about Asher was like his father. Jack had known this, at least on an intellectual level. We‚Äôd made sure of it. He *knew*.

But I could tell by looking at him that even though he‚Äôd known, he‚Äôd *hoped* for something else. All the knowledge, counseling, and preparation knowledge in the world couldn‚Äôt kill that hope.

But the reality did, and the reality was Asher wasn‚Äôt his father, nor was he a replacement. Asher wasn‚Äôt even human. He was a monster. Nothing but another nightmare in the revolving horror show of Jack‚Äôs life.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù Jack answered. His voice was steady, which made me almost desperately proud of him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to meet you.‚Äù

Asher slid forward, still moving strangely. I finally saw why: His ankles were chained by an unfamiliar metal etched with equally unfamiliar symbols. So were his wrists.

Bright, blinding anger briefly eclipsed every other emotion as Asher eased himself into the seat next to me, directly across from Jack. Christophe positioned himself between and behind us, so close I could feel his body heat.

‚ÄúA long time ago, I used to dream about someone who looked just like you,‚Äù Asher said. ‚ÄúBut in those dreams, he was my brother.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid your brother look like me?‚Äù Jack asked curiously.

Asher smiled sadly. ‚ÄúI never had brothers. Only a sister.‚Äù

Jack relaxed slightly. ‚ÄúI don't have brothers *or* sisters.‚Äù

The conversation that followed was superficially normal, but carried an undercurrent of bizarreness that‚Äôs difficult to describe.

Asher‚Äôs speech was ordinary yet terribly surreal when juxtaposed against his sheer inhumanity.   Worse, it was agonizingly familiar to me ‚Äî if I closed my eyes, I could pretend we were sixteen again, chattering about all the things that didn‚Äôt matter and none of the things that did.

But not all of him was familiar.

I could easily discern the split between the boy Asher and the carnival monster, and something else too ‚Äî the other entity inside him, the goddess New Olympus had spliced into him.

That wasn‚Äôt even the worst. The worst was that I could tell ‚Äî even as he faced Jack intently, even though every word he spoke was for him ‚Äî that he was just as focused on me as he was on Jack.

I was relieved almost to the point of tears when Jack ended the conversation in his typical abrupt manner: ‚ÄúThanks for coming to see me, but I think I need to go. I‚Äôm pretty tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you for coming to see me even though you‚Äôre tired,‚Äù Asher countered. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome to visit me whenever you want.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou too,‚Äù Jack said vaguely.

And just like that, it was over.

Several chairs scraped across the tile floor, followed by a flurry that almost looked choreographed as we all rose to our feet. Jack‚Äôs team out into the corridor. Charlie followed them while Christophe and Rafael guided Asher away.

In less than thirty seconds, Mikey and I were staring at each other in a dead quiet room.

‚ÄúYou look wrecked,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYeah, I probably am.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòprobably‚Äô?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt want to think about it long to know for sure, I guess?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶okay,‚Äù he answered doubtfully. ‚ÄúWant to talk about it or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool. I respect that.‚Äù

We drifted out into the corridor and back upstairs, passing Sena‚Äôs quarters on our way out. Her door was open. I glanced in and saw her stretched on a little sofa, reading intently while her dog napped in her lap. I saw her brother Arrah too, lounging magnificently in the corner, looking as much of a god as Asher. He met my eyes as we passed. I fought off a shudder.

Mikey was right: I was wrecked. But I didn‚Äôt want to be, so I pretended I wasn‚Äôt as I shook him off and marched resolutely to Charlie‚Äôs office for my debrief.

I had to wait outside his office, but not for long. When he finally came hurrying up the hallway, I couldn't help but notice he looked as troubled as I felt.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs Jack?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúA mess.‚Äù

‚ÄúAsher?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn my professional opinion‚Äî‚Äù He unlocked the door and waved me in. ‚ÄúAsher is *also* a mess. His passenger, however, is anything but.‚Äù

On that enigmatic note, he steered the conversation to Isam‚Äôs condition, followed by Lore‚Äôs itinerary and the arrangements for Dolly and the Bye Bye Mommy.

Once those were settled, he said, ‚ÄúYou did great today. No notes. But before you go, we need to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me guess. About Christophe?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He leaned back, sighing tiredly. ‚ÄúCouple of things. One, he‚Äôs being formally disciplined for how he‚Äôs been treating Merry, as well as his part in the altercation with Larkin. Second, that whole dog debacle caused a rift between him and Richard, which he‚Äôs dealing with very poorly.‚Äù He gave me an unpleasantly insightful ‚Äî and rather inciteful ‚Äî look. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre not helping.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, I‚Äôm not helping?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know the two of you are having relationship difficulties, Rachele. He told me. He also told me you weren‚Äôt particularly receptive to his apology this morning, which is really detrimental to his‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd? What am I supposed to do? Not have feelings?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs if we could stop you from having feelings, Rachele. Not, obviously not, but if you could maybe be more *mindful*‚Äî‚Äù

""How much more mindful can I be, Charlie? Short of outright mothering him, that is, and don‚Äôt you *dare* even‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMerry makes him wildly insecure. I know that‚Äôs Christophe‚Äôs problem. But the problem with Christophe‚Äôs problems is they eventually become everyone‚Äôs problems. If you could maintain a little more distance with Merry, just for Christophe‚Äôs sake‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúFor how long?‚Äù

‚ÄúUntil we get to the bottom of what exactly Merry experienced in‚Äî‚Äù

He cut himself off abruptly, but I eagerly grabbed the severed end and demanded, ‚ÄúIn what? Do you know what Merry saw? Did he talk to you about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course he did.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did he say?‚Äù

He hesitated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really at liberty to divulge that.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you shitting me, Charlie? You better be shitting me. His fight with Christophe boils down to my life or death, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but‚Äî‚Äù

I made every effort to sound reasonable. ‚ÄúSo if you know anything that could help me, you‚Äôre ethically obligated to tell me what it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm not, actually. Second, since when do traditional ethics play any part in our work?‚Äù

‚ÄúCharlie, come on.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen can you at least tell me when you expect to ‚Äòget to the bottom of‚Äô‚Äù‚Äî

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he cut in. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do this to me. Not tonight. Can you just try to treat Christophe with a little more consideration?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow much more consideration does he need?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, his behavior speaks for itself, so if you could be a little more careful‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do *I* have to be careful? I‚Äôm not the one who‚Äôs acting like I‚Äôm twelve! I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, but it‚Äôll make everything easier if you just meet him where he‚Äôs at.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòWhere he‚Äôs at‚Äô is loathing Merry for reasons no one will even explain, so‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, fine,‚Äù he interrupted sharply. ‚ÄúMy opinion on this whole damn thing is that Merry is badly misinterpreting the‚Ä¶the nature of what he saw. However, the entire experience was highly traumatic for him. Combined with the related moral quandary he feels he‚Äôs facing, to say nothing of his stress surrounding New Olympus‚Äî‚Äù

Someone knocked on Charlie‚Äôs door.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù Charlie said wearily.

Richard entered. I smiled reflexively. The smile he gave in return was less than stellar. ‚ÄúSorry to interrupt, Charlie,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre having big problems with one of your special inmates.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich inmate?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho else? The Ticketer.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod damn it,‚Äù Charlie said.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Richard answered. ‚ÄúTell me about it.‚Äù

Charlie immediately dismissed me, which made me even angrier. I stalked out, fighting the urge to slam the door, and stormed down the hallway. I turned the corner and slammed into the Harlequin, face-first into his decay-slimed shirt.

I stumbled away, gagging, while he put his hands on my shoulders and leaned down until we were eye level. Speaking of eyes, his were yellowed and unfocused. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, darling girl?‚Äù His voice was as distant as his gaze. ‚ÄúYou look so upset.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just one of those days,‚Äù I grumbled.

‚ÄúWhen you don't want to wake up?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, no. I was actually in a really good mood when I‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúEverything is fucked, everybody *sucks*.‚Äù His face sharpened somehow, and his mouth fell open in a grin. ‚ÄúYou don't really know why, but you want to justify ripping someone‚Äôs head off.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know what?‚Äù I ducked, twisted around, and took him by the hand. ""Let's get you back to your office.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I get so tired in there,‚Äù he whined.

‚ÄúWhich one? The director's office, or Richard‚Äôs?‚Äù

‚ÄúBoth.""

‚ÄúWell, do you want to go back to your cell instead‚Ä¶? Or‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said gratefully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like that very much.‚Äù

By the time we reached Ward 1, he was shuffling like an old man and leaking foul-smelling liquid from his rotten chest cavity. It pattered on the floor and dripped onto my arm, soaking into my jumpsuit.

I got him into his cell and peeled off his rot-stained shirt, studiously avoiding the array of hideous wounds beneath, and bundled him into his bed.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget,‚Äù he slurred. ‚ÄúTeambuilding tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forget.‚Äù

He smiled rather deliriously, but didn‚Äôt say anything more. At a loss, I tucked him in. He fell sleep before I was done.

I tiptoed back to my room, where I ran the hottest shower I could stand and scrubbed diligently until I was sure I‚Äôd scoured away every molecule of his living corpse fluid, then scrubbed again for good measure.

Then I got dressed and decided to go for a walk, partly to clear my head, partly to figure out what I was actually going to say to Christophe.

It was beautiful outside, at least. Warm and balmy, with thin clouds that diffused the sunlight. Grass rippled in a soft breeze. Birds sang and bees bobbed between clover blooms under riotously green trees swathed in spider webs.

I‚Äôd just started to cheer up when I heard voices. One was unmistakably Christophe‚Äôs.

He emerged from the trees a moment later, followed closely by the last person I expected: Merry. Their expressions were grave. While I couldn‚Äôt make out their words, their tones were low and worried. Larkin trotted between them, fur gilded by the evening light.

Merry saw me first. He cut off midsentence and smiled breezily. Christophe tracked his gaze and frowned. They both looked miserable, but for once there was no hostility between them.

I hurried over, preemptively exhausted. Merry said, ‚ÄúHey, girly whirl.‚Äù

‚Äú*What* did you call me?‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúIt sounded better in my head. Here.‚Äù He took the leash from Christophe. ‚ÄúYou two go off and talk. I‚Äôll take Larkin.‚Äù

‚ÄúWatch him closely,‚Äù Christophe warned. ‚ÄúHe will destroy any belonging he likes if he senses you are not paying attention.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe sounds like Teddy. Have no fear, I‚Äôm up to the task.‚Äù He patted Larkin‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúCome on, Corporal. Let‚Äôs get you some dinner.‚Äù

He quickly led Larkin away, leaving me and Christophe staring awkwardly at each other.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThat is ridiculous,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou did not do anything to be sorry for.‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, I insulted you and ran away, so‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI was not being reasonable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo do not apologize.‚Äù

A headache began to pulse at my temples. ‚ÄúWhat were you and Merry talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúHis apology,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd mine.‚Äù

We ambled deeper into the woods, sidestepping sun-dappled bees and the occasional dragonfly. ‚ÄúDo you want to talk about it at all?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas it really that bad?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was a bad part of a bad day.‚Äù He glanced at me. ‚ÄúYou had a bad day, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt the day I was hoping for,‚Äù I admitted.

‚ÄúMe either.‚Äù He reached for my hand. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try to have the night we are hoping for.‚Äù

We walked until nightfall, talking about everything and nothing. Unbidden, I thought of the conversations I used to have with Asher, Jason, and Amanda. How we always spoke long into the night. Endless, ambling, dominated by tangents that never went anywhere.

By the time we made our way back to the Pantheon, dinner was long over so Christophe made sandwiches in the staff kitchen while I watched. On our way out, he stole an entire bunch of bananas from the fridge.

It was difficult to eat, and not even for the usual reasons, only because I felt lightheaded and unwell.

Christophe noticed, of course, and assumed the worst.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just stress,‚Äù I said wearily. ‚ÄúFrom our fight last night. On top of that I didn‚Äôt sleep well, then I had a bad day, and it‚Äôs all just coming to a head.‚Äù

‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù he said, but he still made sure I ate every bite.

Afterward, we went to fetch Larkin, but Merry insisted on keeping him. A brief peek in his room showed why: His cat, Teddy, was curled up between Larkin‚Äôs paws. Both were fast asleep.

‚ÄúHe always liked Teddy,‚Äù Merry explained in a whisper while Birdy sulked on his shoulder.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like either of them,‚Äù she complained.

‚ÄúLarkin helped me catch Teddy a few times, actually,‚Äù Merry continued. ‚ÄúHe even prevented a full on breach right before he transferred to San Diego. Anyway, I‚Äôll take care of the sleepover. You guys take care of yourselves, okay? Okay.‚Äù

On our way to our room, Christophe said reluctantly, ‚ÄúI understand why he is your friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe could be yours too.‚Äù

He grimaced slightly. ‚ÄúI am not ready for that and I do not want to be.‚Äù

Heaving a sigh, I wound my arm through his and leaned in.

‚ÄúYou are very warm,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird, because I feel cold.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure you are not ill?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I admitted.

By way of response, he immediately made me change into pajamas for bed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs early,‚Äù I complained.

‚ÄúNo, it is not. Tomorrow is our staff camping trip, and we must wake up before dawn. Lay down.‚Äù

He fussed over me for the rest of the evening. It was mildly excruciating for me, but seemed to have a soothing affect on him. Still, no matter what he did I couldn‚Äôt shake my chill. Not until he got into bed with me did I finally feel warm enough to settle down.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you and Merry worked things out,‚Äù I said drowsily. ‚ÄúI like when you get along.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have not worked anything out,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut he explained to me what happened to him, and why he fears what he fears.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúDid he tell you why he thinks you‚Äôre going to kill me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

My drowsiness evaporated, leaving me wide awake and angry as hell. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I do not want to frighten you.‚Äù

Before I knew it, I was halfway out of bed. ‚ÄúYou know what actually frightens me right now?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis creepy, controlling, self-centered refusal to explain anything that might make you look even a little bit bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúI would not explain it well,‚Äù he argued. ‚ÄúEven he did not explain it well, so I will do worse. And he asked me not to tell you anyway, not until he‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúSince when do you listen to Merry?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am keeping my word, that is all.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre keeping information from me because you‚Äôre afraid of what I‚Äôll think.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is not true. Get back into bed.‚Äù He reached for me, but I waved him off and stumbled away, grimly ignoring a swell of vertigo. ‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù

‚ÄúGetting more space,‚Äù I said dramatically, and stalked out.

I immediately regretted it.

No matter what I told him, I was definitely coming down with something ‚Äî almost certainly Birdy‚Äôs fever ‚Äî and I already sorely missed our warm bed. But I didn‚Äôt miss it enough to swallow my anger and go back, so I went to Klaudiya instead.

She was thrilled to see me, and immediately arranged a bedroll on the floor, chattering cheerfully all the while. I smiled, trying and failing to follow her words as I crawled under the blanket, promptly falling asleep as another ominous chill rolled up my spine.

I felt like I‚Äôd barely closed my eyes when knocking jolted me from sleep.

I sat up, shivering, and staggered to the door while Klaudiya mumbled.

It was Christophe, looking rather sullen. ‚ÄúIt is almost time to leave,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI have already packed for you, but you need to get dressed.‚Äù

I followed him back to our room and changed in stony silence while he double-checked the supplies in the two backpacks sitting by the door.

Then we left the room, filing down the hall to the front of the building just in time to see Merry and Courtney sleepily exit. We followed them outside, and I froze.

The most absurdly enormous van I‚Äôve ever seen was idling near the doors. The Harlequin stood in front of it, outfitted in full camp counselor regalia: Bermuda shorts, a tight white T-shirt, and a plastic visor, with a whistle hanging from his neck.

He was pacing impatiently and looked as though he was on the verge of an explosion. When he saw us, his eyes bulged in fury. ‚ÄúWhat took you so long?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are on time,‚Äù Christophe objected.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the last ones to arrive, which means *you‚Äôre late!*‚Äù

I ignored this and asked, ‚ÄúWhy are we taking a van? Can‚Äôt you just portal us to‚Ä¶wherever we‚Äôre going instead of making us carpool at four in the morning?‚Äù

‚ÄúTeambuilding exercises are about the experience, darling girl, and where, I ask you, is the *experience*  in *portalling* to our destination?‚Äù

I was too tired to argue, so I clambered into the van. It was nearly full ‚Äî so full, in fact, that there were only two seats left at the very front, directly behind the driver‚Äôs seat.

I took one. Christophe plopped down beside me, carefully placing our backpacks under the seat. Then he placed his hand against my forehead. I fought the urge to smack him away. ‚ÄúYou are too warm,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou should stay.‚Äù When the Harlequin climbed into the driver seat, he said, ‚ÄúDirector?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt distract the driver!‚Äù the Harlequin snapped.

‚ÄúDirector,‚Äù he persisted, ‚ÄúShe is‚Äî‚Äù

The Harlequin gave three sharp blasts on his whistle, so shrill and so impossibly loud it paralyzed me. Rafael, who was in the passenger seat, jumped so high he hit his head on the ceiling.

‚Äú*Don‚Äôt*,‚Äù the Harlequin screeched, *‚Äúdistract the driver*!‚Äù

Then he turned on the radio. When the unmistakable strains of *After Dark* by Mr. Kitty exploded, he turned the volume dial all the way up and started to drive.

I curled up and tried to sleep, but was far too uncomfortable. My head swam, my bones felt like they were quaking, and I was so cold that when Christophe draped an arm around my shoulders, I snuggled in instead of shoving him away because the warmth was so welcome.

Warm or not, I felt abruptly worse when the sun rose, flooding the interior of the van with ungodly bright light that sparked an equally ungodly headache.

Rafael sat, stiff and unmoving, as he yelled out directions from the extremely blood-spattered map in his hands.

‚ÄúWhat a small voice you have, Commander,‚Äù the Harlequin complained, spinning up the volume dial even further. ""I can't hear you! Speak up!‚Äù

I covered my ears, practically burrowing into Christophe‚Äôs armpit while he struggled to keep Larkin calm.

Finally, after what must have been several hours, the van slowed to a crawl. I peeked out the window and saw a rustic little guard shack.

The Harlequin turned off the music and turned to Rafael. ‚ÄúGive me your wallet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm the director, and I am directing you to give me your wallet.‚Äù

Rafael hesitated, looking with mute appeal at Christophe, who shrugged. Then he twisted around, extracted a battered brown wallet from his pocket, and resignedly slammed it into the Harlequin‚Äôs oversized palm.

The Harlequin quickly riffled through it, extracting three cards, Rafael‚Äôs license, and a small photo I couldn‚Äôt quite make out before shoving it all into his own pocket. Then he pulled out all the money, threw it at the gate attendant without explanation, and slammed down on the gas pedal.

Somehow, we drove for another three hours.

Part of this was undoubtedly Harlequin bullshit. The other part was the blood-spattered map. Every time I glanced over Rafael‚Äôs shoulder, it was changing before my eyes: Roads snaked and slithered like living worms, tangling with each other before splitting off again, only to knot together once more.

I couldn‚Äôt keep track of it, and didn‚Äôt particularly want to. I closed my eyes, fighting off another shiver as the van lurched and shuddered onward.

According to the clock, it was almost noon when the van finally screeched to a stop, throwing us all forward. My head smacked the seat while Larkin went flying. Rafael caught his collar a fraction of a second before he collided with the center console.

‚ÄúMy team,‚Äù the Harlequin announced grandly, ‚Äúwe have arrived!‚Äù

We disembarked blearily. The sun was so bright it sent pain rocketing through my head, and a cloud of mosquitoes merrily descended on us.

Without warning, the Harlequin spun around and blasted me with a can of bug repellant that he apparently conjured out of nowhere. It was acrid beyond belief. I bent double in shock, wheezing as the Harlequin turned the repellant on Christophe, who wheezed and gagged as the Harlequin sprayed him down, starting at the crown of his head and ending by drenching his shoes. Once he emptied the can, he ate it.

In response to my expression, he glowered and said, ‚ÄúWhat? No littering.‚Äù

Now that my eyes had quit watering, I finally got a good look at where we were: An isolated meadow lined with trees on three sides and a lake on the fourth.

In the center was a monstrous pile of junk: Ragged tents, shredded sleeping bags, sunbleached kayaks sporting hideous claw marks longer than my arm, deflated soccer balls, tangled volleyball nets, frayed ropes, broken racquets, snapped fishing poles, and damp, worm-eaten firewood crusted with what could only be blood and hair.

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù I asked, revolted.

‚ÄúLeftovers from my prior trips,‚Äù the Harlequin said. ‚ÄúAnd new-to-you supplies for *our* camping trip! Look!‚Äù He indicated it with a dramatic flourish. ‚ÄúEverything we need is already right here!‚Äù

Rafael was so pale he looked vaguely green. ‚ÄúDirector, this is‚Ä¶this is fucking *preposterous*.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs preposterous is littering and wastage,‚Äù the Harlequin said haughtily, ‚ÄúEspecially in this, the age of anthropogenic climate change! Waste not, want not!‚Äù

Somewhere behind me, Mikey burst into a desperate fit of laughter.

The Harlequin locked onto him, looking positively murderous. ‚ÄúLittering is funny to you, is it? Of course it is. Damage is always a joke to the inflictors. Now.‚Äù He drew up to his full height. His eyes were bright, his color high, his hair lustrous. Were it not for the visible decay creeping wetly down his arms and up his throat, he‚Äôd have looked very healthy indeed. ‚ÄúI assume you‚Äôre all wondering why, out of all the staff in the Pantheon, the thirty-two of you were chosen for this team-building exercise?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is the last thing I am wondering about right now,‚Äù said Christophe.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because you‚Äôre an incorrigible idiot,‚Äù said the Harlequin, ‚Äúand a perfect example of the point I‚Äôm about to make, which is this: Out of all the workers in our less than fine facility, I chose the sixteen I like best, and the sixteen I hate most!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Christophe asked wearily.

‚ÄúFrom now until the end of this trip,‚Äù the Harlequin continued, ignoring him, ‚Äúyou will be divided into teams.‚Äù

Christophe immediately drew close. His shadow fell over me, shielding me from the sun for a blissful second.

‚ÄúNo, you don‚Äôt,‚Äù the Harlequin said smugly. ‚Äú*I‚Äôm* picking the teams, Mr. Wolf, and I shall divide you as follows: A team of those I like ‚Äî who I‚Äôll call the Goldens ‚Äî and a team of those I hate, who I‚Äôll call the Goats. Our shivering, sweaty little commander is a Golden, while y*ou*, my terrible, horrible, no good, very bad dog, are a Goat.‚Äù

Christophe and Rafael exchanged a look of such pained resignation it was almost exquisite.

True to his word, the Harlequin divided us right there in the meadow. Mikey, Dr. Courtland, Gabriella, Camila, and Rafael joined me as fellow Goldens, while Merry, Charlie, Courtney, Richard, Love, and Aurora joined the Goat team alongside Christophe.

Once he‚Äôd separated us, the Harlequin clapped his hands and said, ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs time to elect your team captains, a task I graciously leave to you!‚Äù

Mikey shoved Rafael forward. The rest of us shrugged our assent. The Goats, meanwhile, embarked on a democratic election that Christophe won in a swift landslide.

After that, the Harlequin insisted we paint our faces to delineate teams. ‚ÄúI even brought the face paint!‚Äù he said brightly, wrestling a ten-gallon bucket free of the junk pile. I peered in and grimaced ‚Äî it was full of a thick, greasy liquid that sloshed ominously.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not paint, bro,‚Äù Mikey said.

‚ÄúOf course it is! I mixed it myself. Line up, please. Goldens right here, Goats over there so I don‚Äôt have to look at you.‚Äù

The ‚Äúpaint‚Äù was thick, sticky, and horrendously foul. I recognized the coppery smell of blood and the distinctive stench of human decomposition, as well as a heavy indolic scent that reminded me of jasmine. The Harlequin slathered it on my face. It was wet and so itchy I wanted to cry.

The Harlequin painted elaborate designs on the faces of the Goldens, which made everything much worse ‚Äî it was heavy and thick and so itchy I wanted to cry. The Goats, meanwhile, received a single careless streak across the forehead.

Once finished, the Harlequin raised the paint bucket to his lips and drank what was left with such enthusiasm that half of it slopped down his shirt. Then he tossed the bucket onto the junk pile, sighed contentedly, and said, ‚ÄúCaptains, step forward!‚Äù

Christophe and Rafael did so, exchanging that look again.

The Harlequin announced, ‚ÄúYou will now lead your teams in our first task!‚Äù

1lknfdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1lknfdd/what_is_this_a_soul_tie_twin_flame_help_please/,What is this? A soul tie? Twin flame? Help please.,"Hi. 
So I‚Äôm not even quite sure where to start. 
15 years ago I met a man at a new job in a new city. 
As I was being introduced there was a single thought. I‚Äôm so f*ed. Ironically he wasn‚Äôt even remotely my type. 
Then not long after I realized it wasn‚Äôt just me. And he was struggling with all the same feelings. 
One day I was making a coffee at the machine and he asked me to grab him one too. I had never seen him drink coffee so I didn‚Äôt know how he took it but made it exactly as he would. I didn‚Äôt even think to ask. We both had some shock at that. 
Later he was coming towards me and I could see the look in his eyes and I backed up and ended up skidding across the floor and I told him no way, never could we do this. He thought it was funny. I had some genuine panic but not in a fearful way. More fearful of how I was feeling. 

Well it happened anyway. We were those two people who when were in a building together everyone knows and all eyes are on us. 
But I was terrified (thanks historical experiences) of having a relationship. So we skirted around it. He met my family. But not as my partner. As someone who wanted to be as I pushed him away. We spent every moment together we could. Had really deep and intense days constantly. 
As I pushed him away and made it clear we couldn‚Äôt be he ended up married to someone else. 
Over the years and through me moving across the country now twice (I‚Äôm a gypsie looking for where I feel like I belong. It‚Äôs elusive and I‚Äôve come home now, close to where it all began) we have never been able to let go. 
The intensity of our relationship I guess you can maybe call it traveled with me and stayed strong. We would cut ties for a year here or a few months there and somehow one of us always gives it up and then the rest is history again. Talking like a moment hasn‚Äôt passed. Still missing each other. Still needing that bond. 
I know it‚Äôs not just me because no matter where we leave things he has come back to me more than I have to him. 

He split from his wife for a while and found someone almost exactly like me. In nearly every way. And when it didn‚Äôt work he went back to his wife. He didn‚Äôt have the ability to go across the country and I don‚Äôt actually think he would?

I‚Äôm now a couple of hours from him. 
I have been for a few months. 
We talk. Almost every day. Neither of us has made a move to see each other but talk about when we do. 
I dream about this man constantly. And when I tell him about it he laughs and tells me it‚Äôs how he is now or something he does that I never experienced with him in the past. I haven‚Äôt seen this man in 9 years. Not a single time. But somehow there‚Äôs this teather that keeps us bound to one another. 

I‚Äôm mad at him. 
He‚Äôs likely mad at me too. 
But I‚Äôm not sure I could live a life that didn‚Äôt have him in it? (No im not thinking of that in a literal sense. Just that I‚Äôm not sure I would be able to breathe) 

Now that I‚Äôm fully ready he‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs back with his wife. 
I refuse to go see him because we have zero self control. At all. And he refuses to come see me for the same reason. 

We also both have kids now. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do. I swear he‚Äôs my soul. 
I don‚Äôt know what this is. Or how to stop feeling this way. Move on. Leave him to move on. 
Yes she knows about me. She hates me. She‚Äôs known about me from the start of their relationship. And I‚Äôve always tried to be completely respectful and stepped aside when he told me about their new relationship. 
But at the same time he was hurt by me because I couldn‚Äôt give him all of me he said. 

I know he‚Äôs not happy. And neither is she. They decided to get back together for the children. Until they are older. I refuse to wait for him for that many years externally but let‚Äôs be real, I have been waiting longer than that and will likely continue to because I can‚Äôt not have him. 
I hate this. I hate keeping each other at arms length as to not do something, because we know we will. Because we know nothing else exists when we‚Äôre in the same building let alone the same room. The air is charged when we are in a building. When we‚Äôre in a room it‚Äôs like a roar and it‚Äôs only us. Everyone turns to stare. Everyone. And people comment on it. Or they always did. And I know now is no different. The feelings have only gotten stronger on both sides. 

What do I do? 
I know I could do a cord cutting or something but it‚Äôs never been bad. Never volitile, never messy. Only beautiful and intense and like an energy storm in a desert on the hottest of days. 
I don‚Äôt want to cause a landslide of events that would just be horribly bad. And I really don‚Äôt want to live life without him in some way. 
But I can‚Äôt even look at another man with even a hundredth the amount of need, love, passion. It makes dating feel kind of pointless. And unfortunately even the man who fathered my children only succeeded because I was too worn down to continue saying no. 

And what is this? Seriously I don‚Äôt understand. And it‚Äôs not fair. Because it hurts. It hurts that it never is the right time. It hurts that it doesn‚Äôt work. It hurts that we can‚Äôt even be in each others presence without forgetting the world and only breathing each others air. It hurts that I miss him so much and live so close and can‚Äôt actually see him because I know I will hurt someone and also myself. Because we can‚Äôt actually be. 

What on earth is this and what is wrong with me? And why is it stronger today than it was the day we met by a million or so times? Even after all these years apart?",1,1750901137.0,spirituality,0,1.0,False

i don‚Äôt really know where to start. i‚Äôm 23 and still live at home. and yeah, i know a lot of people do‚Äîbut for me, it‚Äôs different. it‚Äôs not ‚Äúhome.‚Äù  
it‚Äôs hell.

my mom‚Äôs always been‚Ä¶ bad. not just strict or annoying. narcissistic, mean, manipulative. since i was a kid she‚Äôs hit me, screamed at me, spit on me‚Äîtreated me like i was disgusting. she‚Äôd take me to family gatherings just to talk bad about me in front of everyone. i‚Äôd sit there holding back tears while people stared. some felt bad. others believed her. and i just wished i could disappear.

even her sisters avoid inviting her to their coffee chats because she‚Äôs always mad at someone. i have this one cute aunt who treats me like her own daughter, and my mom *hates* that. like, actually jealous. she hates when i say good things about other people, especially if they‚Äôre kind to me. she‚Äôs so full of hate.

like recently‚Äîwe were watching an Italian food vlog, and me and my sister were admiring how elegant and free people looked. my mom trashed everything. she insulted their tattoos, their clothes, said they were naked and disgusting. my sister joked and said, ‚Äúa glass of wine a day keeps the doctor away,‚Äù and we giggled. my mom looked at us like she was about to explode.  
over a joke. over nothing.

i‚Äôve tried so hard to block her out. to move on. to feel nothing. but lately the flashbacks are stronger. even when she‚Äôs acting fake-nice, i feel sick. i can‚Äôt unsee what she‚Äôs done. i can‚Äôt un-feel it.

she destroyed who i was supposed to become. now i don‚Äôt even know who i am. she crushed my confidence. i‚Äôm scared to speak, scared to exist. she made me feel like i‚Äôm always too much, or never enough. never right.

and now? she‚Äôs trying to ruin the one thing that makes me feel okay.  
i have a boyfriend. he‚Äôs a sweet, calm, nerdy European guy ( i don't want to date guys from here cause their religion is toxic and i don't want to have anything to do with it). we just talk online, play games, laugh for a couple hours. that‚Äôs all. he makes me feel like life isn‚Äôt always this heavy. he‚Äôs the only peace i get.

but now she‚Äôs accusing me of talking to ‚Äústrangers‚Äù and acting like i‚Äôm some shameful sinner. she won‚Äôt even leave me food if i don‚Äôt come eat the second she says. she literally said, ‚Äúi‚Äôm not leaving food for someone who‚Äôs busy talking to strangers.‚Äù  
meanwhile my brother goes out partying, flirts with ten girls at once, and she‚Äôs like, ‚Äúleave his food! don‚Äôt touch it! that‚Äôs his!‚Äù  
like... what??

why is it always different when it‚Äôs me? why am i treated like a curse in this house?

and now they‚Äôre trying to force me to wear religious clothes. to follow rules i don‚Äôt believe in.  
but the thing is...  
i‚Äôm not even religious.  
they don‚Äôt know that. and i can‚Äôt tell them. if i did... i don‚Äôt even know what they‚Äôd do to me cause they might even K/ill me !!!!  
being a girl in this country is already hard. but being a girl who doesn‚Äôt follow the religion? it feels like you‚Äôre not even allowed to *exist.*

i don‚Äôt party. i don‚Äôt go out. i don‚Äôt dress wild. just hoodies and baggy jeans. literally so respectful.  
i just stay in my room, talk to someone who makes me smile, and try not to cry loud enough for anyone to hear.

but every day i feel smaller.  
like i‚Äôm fading.

>i want to run away. but i‚Äôm scared.  
i don‚Äôt know how to leave.  
but i‚Äôm so tired of living like this.

sometimes i wish i could change the whole country‚Äîbut i can‚Äôt even afford to change my own life. i‚Äôm stuck. i‚Äôm confused. and i feel so alone.

if anyone‚Äôs been through something like this, or has any advice‚Ä¶ please. i really need help. i don‚Äôt wanna live like this forever.

1lkn9xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1lkn9xn/how_to_get_opportunities_in_life/,How to get Opportunities in life?,"I‚Äôm a Finance student from Toronto, Canada, and I‚Äôm tired of not getting any opportunities in life.

I‚Äôve applied to hundreds of internships, scholarships, programs, conferences, university clubs and events, etc. Nothing works.

I‚Äôm ready to work. I‚Äôm ready to learn. I‚Äôm ready to do anything. But I‚Äôm not getting any opportunities.

People talked about missed opportunities, while I'm begging to get one.

I came to the realization that you genuinely have to be rich to make it in life. The majority of top finance and consulting go to people who attend top schools. Those people also end up going to private boarding schools before attending university, which cost like 40k a year. In other words, they were born rich.

Yeah, there‚Äôs some people who gets a high-caliber job, but the majority of the opportunities in life go to these stuck-up rich people who don‚Äôt want to help others. They have this circle where they only want to give opportunities to other rich people, creating this enclosed circle.

I‚Äôve been networking like crazy at school, networking events, nonprofit organizations, Linkedin etc. I wasn‚Äôt born rich. I‚Äôm starting my career from the absolute bottom. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

My life have been miserable due to failing to get any internship. I have so many dreams and aspirations, and I‚Äôm willing to perform. But I‚Äôm not getting any chances.

I‚Äôm just a broke college student. All my aspirations are crushed because I‚Äôm broke with no industry connections. Most people don‚Äôt want to help me out, despite reaching out.

What should I do?

P.S I‚Äôve linked a couple more posts about my resume and job process if you want to understand me better.

Counselling has helped with my boundaries.","Tonight she saw my linked messages where I had asked for the number or email (I‚Äôd lost) of a lady (55F) I worked with for about 3 weeks max. I‚Äôd just left job and handed over to her.
My wife and I were due to go on hols to the county where she had recently married and moved to & my wife and I had talked a bit about this/her and seemed reasonable that I could maybe ask her for any tips or advice for the hol (never did). She was a nice lady but other than a couple of times her asking to catch-up maybe over a coffee after I left - which I politely avoided - we had a v short professional relationship. I had and have no interest in her, ever and messages were not flirtatious. And not had contact sine dec 24.
There followed messages a few months later from me asking how the project had gone (I knew it was due to be delivered and genuine interest) and ‚Äòwere they looking after her?‚Äô.
Replies were all good mostly businessy and above board.
She then said she would soon be back in my area with her husband and if I wanted we could meet for a coffee. I politely said ‚ÄòI‚Äô (not we) was busy - but would not have entertained it. 
I don‚Äôt think there was anything unusual, flirty meant by her at all. Just her warm personality. ? I‚Äôm not daft.
My wife read the full thread and I have explained that there is logical/ok explanations, but now I am in the dog house (spare room) as she thinks I lied and hid this from her. She then went through all my emails and they were clean.
I did wrong to not to give her more detail about 1. the messaging (tho the messages don‚Äôt read bad and she was fully aware at the time of who this lady was) ,2. the offers to catch-up, which I declined. And 3. asking legitimately for contact details.

Writing sample: 

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes‚Äîfive minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.

The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left.

Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrain and slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.

Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.

That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.

It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.

That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world.  
""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.

Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.

The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.

PREGNANT.

In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.

All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow.  
With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.

Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end everyone with, ""Papa, loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.
