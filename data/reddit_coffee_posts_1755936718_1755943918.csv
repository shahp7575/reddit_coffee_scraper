1mxxkj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1mxxkj8/was_she_an_avoidant/,Was she an avoidant?,"I was in a short intense relationship for 3 months. It felt like I finally found the one..
I was seeing her everyday from the beginning, she was so affectionate and was hanging off me, wouldn’t stop texting me. I met her family straight away only because she still lived with them. She was like the most loving person then all of a sudden she started pulling back..
She was less affectionate, we planned to go on a trip a few days before she told me she needs to prioritise her friends and family as well and it’s all about balance and she was telling me how independent she is. I was fine because I thought it was healthy. But she started texting less.. when we went away she wouldn’t touch me or hold my hand, she was saying this is who I am before was only the honey moon phase and I’m not an affectionate person but before she was so affectionate. She would get angry when I tried to talk in the mornings and said she just needs coffee. She was on her phone texting friends and ignoring me..
It felt like I was on a trip with a friend.
But she also said she will have my baby on the trip. When we got back she was acting even more weird, and avoiding meeting up, I asked what’s wrong. She said nothing she is committed.. she would see friends and not me. 
The day she broke up with me I was meant to see her, but she pretended to be sick but later posted on her story showing she was drinking at the bar with family. Then I said we need to talk, then she sent a message by text breaking up with me, saying she is still healthy from her narcissistic ex and that she is not ready for a relationship.. I wished her the all the best, a couple days after she said sorry I didn’t reply i thought you needed space and told me she doesn’t want to cut off contact and still be friends. I said no I’m not looking for a friendship with someone I had feelings for..
Later I asked if she was cheating because there was a night she said she was with a friend having drinks, and when she got home I tried calling she ignored my phone call for 2 hours and said I was having a hot shower. But she was online Facebook that whole time. She said no I don’t cheat in relationships, I apologised and said I need to block you to help me move on, that was just on instagram because deleted her number. Since then I have haven’t heard anything from her, it’s been a month now but the first couple weeks she was checking the work facebook stories not knowing I could see. She stopped looking now, and her instagram has skyrocketed with new followers.. there was even a time where I smelled weed on her and she denied it said it’s in my head it was just a vape, but weed has a smell. I didn’t care that she did but she still lied. It’s the most confusing relationship I’ve been in and I’m still spiralling about it, is this normal?",1,1755943714.0,AvoidantBreakUps,1,1.0,False
1mxxjz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiveparents/comments/1mxxjz3/need_objective_feedback_to_break_the_cognitive/,"need objective feedback, to break the cognitive dissonance","these are things 'no one talks about' in my family. I guess I'm hoping that if I just say it somewhere, I can accept it, and heal properly. I don't want to carry these things on my chest anymore.

how much of this was abuse? and how bad?

- my family are 3 generations of jehovah's witnesses. my grandparents on both sides converted as young adults, and both of my parents were raised in the cult. I was disowned by my entire family in my mid-twenties for leaving the cult and calling it a cult. growing up, things like not celebrating birthdays or holidays, having to sit outside alone in the hallway when parties were happening in class, going door to door to be rejected by strangers, were normal. it was so isolating. I grew up without many friends. 

- my mother and father used to get angry at me for reading... I used to get science books from the library for fun and read fiction for fun. I also read the Bible for fun but that bothered them too somehow. my mother said reading too much was why I had anxiety and why I spent so much time alone. my dad insisted reading books was just something I did to show off. I was essentially bullied out of reading books. 

- when I was a kid, like elementary school age, after he showered, my dad used to come to my brothers room and watch us play with his privates exposed beneath his bathrobe. it was framed as him participating in being a good parent, because he was mainly the disciplinarian at home, not much of a playful or emotionally present parent. I would get so uncomfortable I would leave and go back to my room. but somehow I felt like saying something about it would 'make it something it's not' so I never did. but looking back, I think he did that on purpose.

- my father violently beat all of my brothers, whacking them with belts in the back of their knees, etc. and often without reason or explanation. he also homed in on only one of my brothers for most of his abuse. this same brother would be extremely mean to the rest of us. if anyone made a mess, this brother would get punished. if I got better grades than this brother, he would get punished. so he got extremely frustrated with us and often was very cold to us. but he was so afraid of our father he would shake I just felt protective of him even when he was mean. I would tell my mom everything. I told her since kindergarten that I hated my dad and I think she should divorce him. she never listened to me. I was so protective over my brother and would try not to ever let him be alone with my dad. I felt like as long as I insisted I just wanted to stay around him nothing bad would happen. I wrote letters ro my dad and yelled at my dad as a kid. I was the 'snitch' essentially. I always tattled. so my dad left me alone. but my brother ended up resenting me. he stopped telling me things. he also wet the bed a lot. and I only now know that was a sign something else might have happened. I am hoping I am wrong. because if not, that means my brother has been abused in the worst way possible and no one saved him. this same brother hates me now because I left the religion. I see him around and say hi but we haven't talked in years. he was always rather mean to me but I still love him unconditionally. I will always hate our father for being cruel to him.

- all that being said, I think my brother also hates me for reasons beyond that. my grades in school deeply impacted how my dad treated him. but it was as if he didn't want my help with school either. I was also a very bossy older sister. I made a lot of rules when we played and looking back I think that was super annoying. also when we were super little, like when he was probably in kindergarten, and I was in second grade, I remember playing 'wedding' and trying to make him kiss me. he got so upset and angry and maybe it was no big deal, because that's just how 5 and 7 year olds can be sometimes, and that was the only time anything like that happened, but I still remember it so vividly because his reaction made me feel I did something really really wrong. another time I can think that I felt this way is when we were eating at a family gathering. I really wanted something off his plate. I was angry because I didn't think he even liked the food, and I told him he just wasn't sharing it to be mean to me. I was a bit of a brat. eventually he just said 'fine' and let me have the food (I can't even remember what it was now) but I remember feeling in my gut I did something that permanently made him trust me less.

- in general, I was always the 'tattler' in the family and the one who said everything out loud. I think that's why most people were on their 'best behavior' with me. if something was wrong I always spoke up even if it meant getting in trouble. when I figured out we were in a cult, I said so. being shunned by my entire family taught me to be more discreet.

- one of my uncles was shunned when I was really young for being gay. he's not even in any pictures or anything. everyone pretends he doesn't exist. everyone implied he was a predator too. but actual predators weren't shunned in my family. I found out last year he might have not been gay, but perhaps trans, and not my 'uncle' at all, but my trans aunt? but I don't know. I don't know anything about this person, they're like a strange empty space. I just hope they are alive and well and escaped this damn family.

- a completely different uncle, a 'good' jehovah's witness uncle, once asked me to sit in his lap. I was a teenager already, like 15-17. I was so stunned, I said no thanks with a smile. I completely fawned and laughed it off. but that memory stays seared in my brain. I also knew somehow that if I said anything about it, it would 'make it a big deal' so I only told this to one cousin, years after, when I was already shunned for leaving the religion.

- my mother would never apologize. she had a very 'selective' memory. she often pit us siblings against each other because she hated confrontation. she would make one of us tell the other there was a problem instead of just... being a parent and saying it herself.

- my mother always convinced us her problems were worse than anyone else's. no one else was ever allowed to be 'the one' in pain. even when one of us got really sick, or got into an accident, she would make it about her feeling like a 'bad mother' and not about our pain.

- my mom used to tell me way too often when I was younger she understands why women in slavery sometimes took out all of their kids before offing themselves... her saying that to me more than once made me scared of her honestly. but I never told her that's how she made me feel.

- my mom left a goodbye note on the kitchen table when I was younger. I was old enough to read it, but too young to understand. I saw it and thought she was leaving. she later admitted it was a time she didn't want to stay alive.

- that same uncle who asked me to sit on his lap stalked one of my other cousins. she was a 'perfect' jehovah's witness but he disliked her for some unknown reason. he accused her of secretly dating someone because she was in college and living on campus. she wasn't though. and I knew that and stood up for her. she was extremely hard on herself and an honest person. I think a lot of people in my family resented her for going to college and being successful and while simultaneously being the perfect christian. she got so much hate and jealousy aimed her way I used to hate everyone who was mean to her. I would stop talking to girls at the Kingdom Hall even though it got me in trouble for being 'divisive' because they were mean to her or others. if she didn't cut someone off, I would. she told me she deserved it. she always apologized even when things weren't her fault. she quietly cut me off because I missed her graduation due to anxiety, and because I told her she was being mistreated and that I didn't want to be a Jehovah's Witness anymore.

- in general, my family was against yelling because 'then people can hear our business' so arguments were aggravatingly quiet. it was most important that we 'represented god' by always seeming united and calm and loving. I hated that. I was often the only person crying or yelling during arguments. I was labeled as the 'crazy' one and I don't think I ever stopped being seen as 'crazy'. it didn't help that I eventually wound up in the ward after a depressive episode due to a death in the family. I was stuck in the ward for a week. when I was there, my mother visited. she ominously mentioned she thinks some parents want their kids to stay in the ward so they don't embarrass them... she even suggested I go back after I got out...

- I live with my dad now because my family is still in the cult. I gained a disability and financially couldn't hack it on my own. I am currently trying to escape him. I am grateful that he never hit me, never explicitly abused me. but he does verbally abuse. and he seems to hate me with this quiet anger he won't admit is there. it manifests in him peeing all over the bathroom as if to punish me, breaking my things if I leave them outside of my room, then swearing it wasn't him or wasn't on purpose. he also has this habit of peeing into cups or glassware and leaving them in the bathroom as if he wants me to see them. he blames his old age but I know he does it on purpose. my mom told me he did this their entire marriage but only to his own things, not the family's things. recently, he was angry at me (for some unknown reason. all I do is fawn and stay out of his way.) and I left a coffee cup in the sink. the entire kitchen was clean. I woke up to that same coffee cup in the bathroom with piss. I got the message. and have never left a single thing I own outside of my room unless I needed to.

- sometimes I think he tries to do that thing he did when I was a kid, where he wears little to nothing and acts like he wants to have a conversation. as an adult now I just say 'put some pants on' and walk away.

- he seems scared of me. when I moved in he seemed terrified of messing up, and started to turn his entire life around, even going to therapy (for a month). (forgot to mention, I cut him off at 15 and wouldn't even talk to him for almost a decade, even though the rest of my family continued to. he never officially stopped being a Jehovah's Witness but he was inactive my whole life. when I had no where else to go and was being shunned, he gladly took me in.) and hopefully he remains scared of me. because while I'm grateful to have had somewhere to avoid homelessness, I will always view him as evil for making my brothers shake with fear.

- my dad got so angry once he bought a roach fumigation 💣 and let it off in the house with my entire family in it, and he left the house, without saying anything to us. my mom freaked out at him. and he insisted she was overreacting. but I cannot forget that he left the house... that he knew to leave the house because it was dangerous for people to be in the house when it's fumigated.

- he's done other stuff like this. another example is leaving the oven on 'self cleaning mode' and filling the kitchen with smoke, then saying he's going on a walk or to run errands, leaving me to shut the stove off and scramble to open windows and warn everyone else. my mom believes he is absentminded. but I never ever believed that. I always thought he did it on purpose (but I'm the 'crazy' one. so.)

there's probably more but my brain is flatlining now.

should also probably mention my dad also cheated on my mom. like a hundred times and she stayed for whatever reason. they 'separated' when I was 15 and stayed separated. because of my parents relationship I am very cold when it comes to love. and the truth is... I don't care. I am not interested in love until I can take care of myself and feel truly free. I am planning on permanently cutting off my entire immediate family, except for my youngest sibling because he was only a teenager when I was shunned. I don't blame him for shunning me, since he was just a kid. I do want to leave a line of connection for all my siblings... in case they ever leave the cult. but they were so cruel to me during the process of kicking me out, that I'm debating on if that is healthy for me, or if a clean cut is what I need to heal properly. (my friends opt for a clean cut and a restraining order against my dad. I am very calm about all of this and I agree with them.)

thanks if you read this far. so sorry if you can relate.

and yes I've checked over the years to see if anyone has crossed enough lines to inform the law but... nothing seems tangible enough to get into a legal mess over. my friends suggest recording my dad next time he is verbally abusive, but it's always random and quick and without any warning. and he doesn't cross certain lines, for example he won't break anything unless it can plausibly look like it fell on its own. and he also provides a lot for me financially. on paper nothing is 'serious enough' I am only focused on leaving. my goal right now is just to overcome my disability, or find enough accommodations for it to make money, and be free from this family system and live my life. I had saved up a couple bands years ago, but ended up having to spend it when I became disabled and lost work. I have no other savings. I'm starting all over again. I have a therapist, a psychiatrist, and a small number of friends I trust and can run to in an emergency. I have no expectations regarding my family but I hope my siblings find happiness too.

please give me any feedback, advice, anything. this is the first time in my life I'm putting all of this in words. I just want to stop bottling this all up. I can't even date or let my friends in too close, because I'm so closed off. I haven't been emotionally available in years and I feel so stagnant in life. I'm sick of being 'mysterious' and quiet I want to live my life fully. ",1,1755943661.0,abusiveparents,0,1.0,False
1mxxjxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBeautyCircle/comments/1mxxjxo/louis_vuitton_belmont_damier_ebene_sizing_price/,"Louis Vuitton Belmont Damier Ebene: Sizing, Price, and How to Buy Pre-Loved","So let’s talk about one of the most underrated yet ridiculously chic bags in the LV lineup — the **Louis Vuitton Belmont Damier Ebene**. If you’ve ever drooled over that timeless brown checkered canvas but wanted something more practical than the Neverfull (and less seen than the Speedy), the Belmont is your girl.

I’ve been lowkey obsessed with this bag for a while, and for good reason. It’s elegant, structured, and screams “I’ve got my life together,” even on days when you’re barely surviving on coffee and dry shampoo. But here’s the kicker: it’s no longer available at Louis Vuitton boutiques. Yep, that means if you want it, you’re going to have to **buy pre-loved**. Don’t panic, though. I’ve done the digging for you, and this guide will cover **sizing, price, and how to snag the best deal**.

## What Makes the Louis Vuitton Belmont Bag Special?

The Belmont is kind of like that stylish friend who doesn’t try too hard but still turns heads. Designed in the iconic **Damier Ebene canvas**, it’s lightweight, durable, and versatile enough for work, brunch, and travel.

Some things I love about the **LV Belmont bag**:

* **Structured shape** – It’s not a slouchy tote; it holds its form beautifully.
* **Top handles + detachable strap** – Flex between a **Belmont top handle bag** and a **Belmont shoulder bag** depending on your mood (and outfit).
* **Spacious interior** – It’s big enough for daily essentials without being a bottomless pit.
* **Timeless Damier Ebene** – The brown checkered design is classy, not flashy.

Ever noticed how some LV bags scream “status symbol” a little too loud? The Belmont isn’t that. It’s understated luxury.

---

## Louis Vuitton Belmont Sizes: PM vs MM

Here’s where things get fun (and mildly confusing if you’re new to LV sizing). The **Belmont comes in two main sizes**:

### Belmont PM

* Smaller and more compact.
* Great for minimalists or for evenings when you don’t want to carry your life around.
* Think: phone, wallet, lipstick, keys, maybe a mini notebook.

### Belmont MM

* The more popular size.
* Perfect for work, travel, or anyone who carries “just in case” items (aka me 🙋‍♀️).
* Holds an iPad, small laptop, water bottle, and still looks chic.

If you’re torn, ask yourself this: Do you need your bag to double as a workhorse tote? If yes, go **Belmont MM**. If you’re more of a weekend-brunch-with-friends type, **Belmont PM** is your winner.

## The Price of a Louis Vuitton Belmont

Let’s be real: **Louis Vuitton isn’t cheap**. But since the Belmont is discontinued, you won’t find it on LV’s official site. That means you’re in the world of **pre-loved pricing** — which can actually be a good thing.

Here’s a general breakdown of what you’ll find in today’s resale market:

* **Belmont PM**: Around **\$1,100 – \$1,600** depending on condition.
* **Belmont MM**: Around **\$1,500 – \$2,300** depending on condition and extras (dust bag, lock, keys, receipts, etc.).

Obviously, **Louis Vuitton Belmont price** can swing up or down depending on the seller. But compared to some LV bags that skyrocket in value, the Belmont is still one of the more “attainable” pieces.

Pro tip: Look out for listings that say **Louis Vuitton Belmont sale** or **Belmont discount**. Sometimes you’ll catch deals when sellers want a quick turnaround.

---

## How to Spot a Good Deal on a Pre-Loved Belmont

So, how do you make sure you’re not overpaying — or worse, buying a fake? Here are some tips from my own trial-and-error shopping sprees:

1. **Check the condition categories** – Most resale sites will list bags as “Excellent,” “Very Good,” or “Good.” If it just says “Fair,” brace yourself for cracked leather or sticky lining.
2. **Verify authenticity** – Always buy from a trusted reseller. Reputable marketplaces usually offer **third-party authentication**.
3. **Compare across platforms** – Don’t jump on the first listing. Prices vary widely across sites like Fashionphile, Rebag, Vestiaire, and even Amazon pre-loved.
4. **Factor in extras** – A Belmont with the original dust bag and receipt is always worth more than one without.
5. **Don’t ignore small flaws** – If you’re okay with a minor scuff or worn corner, you can save a few hundred dollars.

Honestly, I kind of like bags with a little “character.” It feels like they’ve lived a life before coming to me. :)

## Where to Buy a Pre-Loved Louis Vuitton Belmont

This is the million-dollar (well, hopefully not literally) question: **where to buy Louis Vuitton Belmont bags safely?**

Here are some reliable places I’ve personally browsed or bought from:

* **Amazon Pre-Loved** – Super convenient, often has **Belmont availability** in both PM and MM.
* **Fashionphile** – Great selection, and they’re obsessive about authenticity.
* **Rebag** – Offers trade-ins if you ever want to swap bags later.
* **Vestiaire Collective** – More European sellers, so sometimes prices are better.
* **The RealReal** – Deals pop up if you’re quick.

[Check current Belmont availability on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4fWh0D6)

## Belmont vs Other LV Bags

So how does the **LV Belmont bag** stack up against LV classics like the Speedy or Neverfull? Here’s my honest take:

* **Belmont vs Neverfull**: The Neverfull is roomier, but it lacks structure. If you like a bag that stands tall and doesn’t collapse when empty, Belmont wins.
* **Belmont vs Speedy**: The Speedy is iconic, but let’s be real — it’s everywhere. The Belmont feels fresher and less overdone.
* **Belmont vs Alma**: The Alma is more formal, almost ladylike. The Belmont has more versatility and works better for everyday wear.

So IMO, the Belmont is like the sweet spot — structured but practical, chic but not overhyped.

---

## How to Style the Belmont

You probably don’t need me to tell you this, but styling the **Damier Ebene checkered bag** is effortless. That brown canvas with dark leather trims goes with literally everything.

Some outfit pairings I love:

* **Workday**: Black trousers, crisp white shirt, Belmont MM. Done.
* **Casual weekend**: Jeans, oversized sweater, Belmont PM crossbody.
* **Travel look**: Leggings, trench coat, sneakers, Belmont MM as your chic carry-on.

Honestly, it’s one of those bags that makes you look polished no matter how many hours of sleep you got last night.

---

## Is the Belmont Worth Buying Pre-Loved?

Short answer: **yes**.

Longer answer: If you want a **timeless Louis Vuitton Damier Ebene bag** that’s practical, stylish, and a little less “basic” than the Neverfull or Speedy, the Belmont is 100% worth it. It holds value well, it’s durable, and you’ll actually enjoy carrying it daily.

And if you score it pre-loved at a decent price? Even better.

1mxxi0j,https://i.redd.it/q285b4uhtqkf1.jpeg,"From Clashing with My Boss to Ruling the Office, Then Benched by a New Mate","
TL;DR: Hated my new boss Mercy, but we became the ultimate work duo, running the show like a top-notch kombi crew. Then a new guy, Amir, swooped in, and now I’m the odd one out. Lowkey enjoying the chill, though.

When Mercy rolled in as my new boss, I was not impressed. I was the guy running our department like a smooth kombi, doing things my way, no stress. Then she shows up in her beat-up brown 1000cc banger mate, that car was rougher than a potholed road in Mbare. Her pushy vibe, that faint perfume she wore, and her obsession with reports had me proper vexed. It felt like I was a shiny new toy, straight from the shop, and she was the kid ripping me out of my packaging, forcing me into some clumsy tea party. I was over it, full stop.

Weekends were my escape. I’d hit my favourite spot in Avondale think Nando’s vibes but with better coffee and cheaper sadza to clear my head from Madam Boss’s micromanaging. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a solid worker. Never showed her any attitude, and I’m pretty sure she never clocked my silent beef. I kept it professional, but deep down, I was just done.

Things started to shift, though, slow slow like a kombi stuck in Jo’burg Road traffic. Office politics were brutal other departments were out here playing us like chess pieces, inviting one of us to a work braai and “forgetting” the other. It was like something out of *The Office*, but with more gossip and less Michael Scott. Mercy and I realised we had to team up to survive. So, we cooked up a plan. She joined the office party planning / event planning crew (yep, we’ve got one), and I became the unofficial cameraman, snapping pics at every event like I was shooting for The Herald. We turned the tables, and our department’s budget went from zero to hero. We were the ultimate duo, Mercy na ini, running tings like ED and Chiwenga in their prime.

The interns started whispering that we were an item. Nah, zvinhu zvacho, it was just pure chemistry. We were tight like sadza and stew. She helped me buy my first stand in Borrowdale and even gave me tips for my engagement (yep, I put a ring on it, but on earlier lost i shared how my engagement failed). I had her back too—when her son was going through it, I was there with advice and a listening ear. I even convinced her to ditch that brown banger for a sleek dark blue whip. We were the office husband and wife, no romance, just vibes.

Then enter Amir, the plot twist. This mate shows up—lighter skin, slick Arabic hair, charm for days. He was a proper addition, no cap. For a minute, we were like the Fantastic Four, the three of us. But slowly, the fire between me and Mercy started to fade. The late-night work calls? Gone. Weekend check-ins? Vanished. Those work trips we used to plan? Dried up like Lake Kariba in a drought. I didn’t see it coming, but I was getting replaced.

The climax hit two months ago. Mercy had proper beef with the CEO she’d embarrassed him in front of the big bosses, and the air was thicker than a Harare smog. There was this major work trip she was supposed to lead, all expenses paid, fancy hotels, the works. I’d helped the CEO with some project, and he casually asked if I’d want to go instead. I told him I’d check with Mercy, thinking she’d appreciate the heads-up. Big mistake. She got all cagey, proper defensive, but I confirmed anyway. That trip was mine, and let me tell you, it was lit networking with the who’s who, living like a king.

But when I came back, I was the outcast. Mercy barely talks to me unless it’s absolutely necessary. Amir? He’s the new golden boy, getting all the calls, the weekend check-ins, the work trips. I’m out here in the cold, sidelined like a subbed-out Warriors player. At first, it stung. I’d lost not just a work partner but a real one—a sharp, fierce woman who made me better at my grind.

Now, though? I’m kinda cool with it. No more playing therapist for her personal drama or giving endless emotional support. I can focus on my hustle, my fiancée, my life. Amir’s smashing it, and I’m not mad. By the power vested in me by corporate I declare them work husband and wife, as they run like a proper Harare power couple.

We're two friends who decided to skip the funding chase and bootstrap our way into SaaS Probably not the smartest move, but it feels right for us.

Right now,

* We're company bootstrapped (read: broke).
* We've made $0 in revenue so far.
* Everyone tells us to focus on one thing only -- but we're stubbornly trying two.

Why post here?

Because we don't just want to shout ""look at our product"". We want to share our journey -- wins, screwup, and lessons -- with people who've been in the trenches or are just starting out.

Some quick facts:

* First beta users? Half of them ghosted.
* First launch? Crickets.
* Biggest lesson? Building is easy, distribution is nightmare.
* Why keep going? because even with $0 revenue, we're learning like crazy and having fun.

We're here to:

* Share what we’re learning (cold emails, pricing experiments, user churn, all of it).
* Learn from this community (what you’d do differently if you were us).
* Hopefully make some connections with other bootstrappers who know this pain.

So that’s us. Two stubborn founders, two risky products, zero funding, and probably way too much coffee ☕.

Curious -- if you were in our shoes, would you double down on one product, or keep juggling both?",1,1755943462.0,SaaS,2,1.0,False
1mxxgyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1mxxgyo/ghosted/,Ghosted,"Pulling into the lot, Maya parked next to Carl’s Civic. She stared at it for a moment before killing her engine.

“You can do this,” she sighed, grabbing her badge in her dash for the entrance. 

The fluorescent lights at OmniCenter’s call center hummed a flat dead note. Another eight hours of scripted smiles and verbal abuse for minimum wage and decent 401k. Maya skipped to her cubicle, her jingling key rings announcing her tardiness.

Slumping into position, she logged into her phone with seconds to spare.

""Maya. Just the agent I was hoping to see,” her boss cheered, “Your average handle time last shift was a thing of beauty. Absolutely pristine.""

""Oh. Thanks, Carl,"" she nodded, catching her breath.

""Don't 'thank' me. It's just data. And data doesn't lie. Keep this up, and we'll be talking team lead sooner than you think. Now, let's hit those queues. I'm expecting great things tonight,"" Carl smiled, his knuckles bleaching on the cubicle frame.

“Anything else?” Maya mumbled.

“Nope. That’s it,” he snapped, tapping his fingers on the walls edge as he left.

Maya  donned the vice of  a headset, opening the lines for calls. She fielded through complaints and dead air.

“Thank you for calling OmniCard, this is Maya, how can I help you?”

“My card’s being declined for a transaction. I’m hoping you can be my hero tonight,” Eric uttered. 

“I’ll certainly try. Can I get your card number?” Maya chirped through a professional smile. 

As she typed, Eric continued, “It’s just for a pizza. Long night, you know? You sound like you use a slice from Papa Rizzo’s.”

“Okay, Mr. Eric, I see the issue. The fraud algorithm flagged it. I can authorize it right now for you.”

“Eric, please. Mr. Eric was my father,” he chuckled. “And thank you. You are a hero. It’s nice to talk to someone who doesn’t just read from a script.”

“Just doing my job. Enjoy your pizza.”

“Will do, Maya. Have a good night.”

“You too.”

Ending the call, she punched out of her phone to grab a coffee. From his cubicle Carl glanced at her, tapping a pen against a spreadsheet. She looked away, her smile fading.

“Hey girl,” Ava chirped, “You get the workforce management talk from Carl yet?”

“No.” Maya fixed her coffee. “What is it?”

“The usual. ‘My girlfriend dumped me, so I am gonna take it out on the call reps,’” Ava joked in her best Carl impression.

“We’re family. The company values your time,” Maya snorted.

“Maybe, one of us should date him,” Ava snickered, “Take one for the team.”

“He’s all yours girl,” Maya chuckled.

“What’s so funny?” Carl stood in the doorway.

“Just girl talk,” Maya muttered into her coffee.

“Well we need coverage on the phones,” Carl tapped the doorframe, “Can’t have everyone on break at the same time.”

“Sorry,” Maya acquiesced, squeezing past him.

As she logged back in, the next call chimed in. 

“OmniCard, this is Maya.”

“Maya? It’s Eric. We spoke earlier? Papa Rizzo’s”

“Yes, Eric. Is there another issue?” her brow furrowed. 

“I just wanted to… review my recent transactions,.” he stammered.

“Of course.” She pulled up his account. “Can you verify your last few transactions? I can…”

“Was the coffee shop charge for $6.50?” he interrupted.

“Yes.”

“Ah, right. The americano,” he sighed, “Sorry, it’s just… you have a very calming voice. It’s been a rough week. It’s nice to talk to a real person.”

“Sir, I’m happy to help with your account, but…”

“It’s Eric. Please. And I know, I know, it’s unprofessional. But don’t you ever get lonely here? Anyways, how's your coffee?”

Carl surveyed the call center, a frown on his face. Maya raised her eyebrows tilting her head towards the phone. 

“Sir, if there are no issues with your transactions, I need to make my line available for other clients.”

“Right. Of course. Sorry for taking up your valuable time, Maya.” 

The line went dead as Carl reached her cubicle.

“A caller just called back personally. Kinda creeped me out.”

“Maybe he’s just friendly?”

""It made me uncomfortable.""

""Fine... let's pull him up,” Carl groaned, leaning over her keyboard. “Ah. Yes. His Average Handle Time is twelve minutes. Do you know what that does for our occupancy rates? He's a goldmine.""

""He asked if I get lonely.""

""Your After-Call Work on that one was almost three minutes."" Carl’s smile faded as he propped himself on her cubicle wall. ""Look, Maya. You have a gift for engagement. But you need to control the call flow, not let it control you. This sounds less like harassment and more like an agent who lost grip on a conversation and is now trying to CYA. Am I wrong?""

""I know what I heard.""

""What I hear is a dip in efficiency. Leadership is breathing down my neck about shrinkage, and now my top agent wants to file a report that will tie us up in meetings. Be professional. Manage the call. Now, please, log back into your phone. We have a service level to maintain.""

Maya’s eyes followed Carl as he moseyed back to his desk. Shrugging, she opened the line taking the next call.

“Maya…” a voice whispered.

“Sir,” she barked, “this is a professional line. Do you have a valid account inquiry?”

The caller disconnected the call. Maya winced and took the next call. Her phone rang, going dead as she answered. Ring. Dead. Rising up in her seat, she scanned the floor. The fluorescent light’s drone intermingling with Ava’s call script. Carl studied his monitor, rapping his pen against the spreadsheet. His gaze broke from the screen in her direction. Maya shrunk behind the quarter wall of her cubicle.  Ring. Dead.  Ring. Dead.

A ping from Carl emerged on her screen, *Late shift metrics are in. We’re overstaffed. Maya, you’re at the bottom. I need you to clock out.*

Maya typed, *Please. The calls... he's still out there. I can't.* She held the backspace key, deleting her plea. She auxed out of the call queue, striding over to Carl’s station to ask to stay.

""Maya, Maya, Maya. After all we've discussed? You’re overreacting. The real-time adherence report says we're over headcount, and my hands are tied,"" he sighed, dropping his pen on the spreadsheet.

""Just let me stay until shift change. I'll do busywork. For old time’s sake?""

""You know... it's against policy. But for you? Fine. I'll walk you out. I forgot my charger in my car anyways.”

""Thanks, Carl. You’re a lifesaver,"" she breathed, clutching her bag.

“Whatever,” he smirked.

The humidity smothered the dark parking lot as the pair stepped outside. Maya hugged her hoodie, her badge clacking against her purse as she adjusted the strap.

“See?” he huffed, “Not so bad.”

“Thanks again for walking out with me.”

“Of course,” he nodded. “Old time’s sake, right?”

They walked in silence. The buzz of the building’s rooftop units followed them across the concrete. Her footsteps echoed sharper than his, like she was moving faster without meaning to.

“Eric, is it?” Carl asked.

She glanced at him. “Yeah.”

“Creeps like that never learn how to take a hint.” He shoved his hands in his pockets. “You know, you have a really empathetic phone voice. That’s why they latch on.”

They passed the row of handicapped spots. Maya fumbled for her keys.

“You didn’t used to be this quiet with me,” Carl pressed.

“That was different.”

“How so?”

She found her keys and held the key fob between her fingers like a blade. 

“It was a fun mistake, but I need this job more.”

“Sure.” Carl laughed, “I just keep thinking about how you ended it. One minute we’re texting after shift, then you ghosted.”

“Nothing, personal,” she muttered.

“Oh, I think it was,” he chuckled, “I get it. The office rumors, the performance favoritism… I’m your dirty secret.”

Stopping at her car, her fingers hovered above the door handle. Carl leaned back against the Civic, crossing his arms.

“You know,” he grumbled, “I never really minded being a secret at first. But it does make me wonder…”

Maya opened the door, tossing her purse on the passenger seat.

“Wonder, wha…”

Snatching the back of her head, Carl smashed her face into the doorframe. Maya’s nose cracked as she collapsed over the center consul. 

“Why you women are so entitled,” he rasped, “What gives you the right?”

Committed he pummeled her face against the gearshift. Her legs kicked. Crimson pooled in the cupholders. The car rocked as he spewed curses, emptying his rage on Maya. 

“Women,” Carl huffed, ”Figures. Always making messes for men to clean up.”

The keys slipped from her fingers, clattering against the pavement. Carl reached in his pocket, popping his trunk with his fob. With a grunt, he heaved Maya’s body into his arms. Dropping her body in the empty compartment, he paused.

“There’s only one way to keep a secret,” he whispered.

Carl returned her car. Gathering her purse. Retrieved the keys from the concrete. Slamming them all shut in the trunk like an old file. The Civic beeps echoed in the twilight. He smoothed his shirt, turning back towards OmniCard.

1mxxdir,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1mxxdir/ice_cold_by_tess_gerritsen/,Ice Cold By Tess Gerritsen,"Hey everyone! I just finished reading **Ice Cold By Tess Gerritsen** and I have to say, it's one of those books that really sticks with you. If you're looking for a gripping read that keeps you guessing, you might want to check out [Ice Cold By Tess Gerritsen](https://pdfhive.com/ice-cold-by-tess-gerritsen/). I wanted to share my honest thoughts, kind of like we're chatting over coffee, especially for those of you who are maybe new to thrillers or just looking for a good recommendation.

### A Quick Peek (No Spoilers, Promise!)

This book plunges you into a chilling mystery when a seemingly perfect doctor disappears during a medical conference in Wyoming. Her husband, who also happens to be a doctor, finds himself caught in a web of suspicion and dark secrets. As the investigation unfolds, the isolated, snow-covered setting becomes almost a character itself, amplifying the feeling of dread and isolation. It’s a classic Tess Gerritsen – lots of medical detail, unexpected twists, and a real sense of unease that slowly builds.

### What Really Stood Out For Me

**Characters:** I found the characters really well-developed. The main detective, in particular, felt very human, with his own struggles and dedication. You really get into their heads, trying to figure out who's telling the truth and what everyone's hiding. Tess Gerritsen excels at creating characters who are both intelligent and flawed, which makes them feel very real.

**Writing Style & Pacing:** Gerritsen's writing is incredibly sharp and precise. She doesn't waste words, but every sentence works hard to build atmosphere and suspense. The pacing is fantastic; it starts with a strong hook and then steadily increases the tension. There are moments when you're just flying through the pages, eager to know what happens next, and then other times you're forced to pause and consider the implications of a new discovery. It’s a real page-turner.

**Emotions:** This book definitely pulled me in emotionally. The feeling of paranoia and the slow unraveling of a seemingly stable life are expertly handled. You really feel the confusion and fear of the characters, especially as the lines between reality and deception begin to blur. It’s not just a puzzle; it's a deeply psychological journey.

### Anything I Didn't Quite Love?

Honestly, it's hard to find major fault with this one if you love a good thriller. Perhaps sometimes the medical jargon can be a little dense, but it's always explained well enough for a casual reader to follow. And while the twists are clever, sometimes you might guess a piece or two of the puzzle if you're a seasoned thriller reader. But even then, the journey to that reveal is so engaging that it hardly matters.

### My Recommendation & Who It's For

Absolutely, yes, I'd recommend **Ice Cold By Tess Gerritsen**! If you enjoy a good mystery, psychological thrillers, or stories with a strong medical angle, this book is definitely for you. It's perfect for casual readers who love to get lost in a compelling story that keeps them guessing until the very end. Fans of authors like Patricia Cornwell or Karin Slaughter would likely find a lot to love here too. You can easily find your copy here: [Ice Cold By Tess Gerritsen](https://pdfhive.com/ice-cold-by-tess-gerritsen/).

### A Little Guide for New Readers

If you're new to reading, or just new to this genre, sometimes it can feel a bit overwhelming to pick up a thick book. Here's a little step-by-step guide and some personal tips to help you out:

*   **Step 1: Don't Be Afraid to Dive In.** Just pick a book that sounds interesting, like this one! The first few pages are usually designed to hook you.
*   **Step 2: Read at Your Own Pace.** There's no race. If you only have 15 minutes, read for 15 minutes. Even a chapter a day adds up!
*   **Step 3: Find Your Spot.** Have a comfy chair, a quiet corner, or even just your bed. Making reading a comfortable habit helps a lot.
*   **Step 4: It's Okay to Not Finish.** This is a big one! If a book isn't grabbing you after a few chapters, it's perfectly fine to put it down and pick up something else. Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore.
*   **My Personal Tip:** I always keep a book with me, even a digital one. You'd be surprised how much reading you can get done in those little pockets of waiting time throughout the day.

Reading is a wonderful journey, and finding a book that truly captivates you is a fantastic feeling. Don't be shy about exploring different genres until you find what truly sparks your interest. Happy reading, everyone! And if you do pick this one up, let me know what you think!

1mxxcyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mxxcyl/explore_if_the_hamilton_beach_5_cup_drip_coffee/,Explore if the Hamilton Beach 5 Cup Drip Coffee Maker review meets expectations!,"Testing out the **Hamilton Beach 46111 5 Cup Drip Coffee Maker** has been an interesting journey. As someone who thrives on caffeine and enjoys the ritual of brewing coffee, this compact coffee maker had an immediate appeal. Its description promises a space-saving design, programmability, and enough functionality to make it feel comparable to larger machines. But does it deliver? Let’s dive into all the features, quirks, and real-life experiences of using this product.

**Compact Design for Small Spaces**  
In my small kitchen, countertop real estate is as precious as coffee itself, and this coffee maker truly shines in this department. Standing at just 10.3"" tall, it slides comfortably under cabinets and doesn’t intrude on my limited space. I appreciated how the swing-out brew basket and front-fill reservoir made setup a breeze. Both were genius design choices because I didn’t have to wrestle with tight spaces or risk spilling water everywhere. It’s a particularly practical choice for studio apartments, dorm rooms, or even office coffee corners.

[Check Hamilton Beach 46111 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b082ls88wn/)  

**Programmability & Wake-Up Convenience**  
One major highlight is its easy-touch programming feature. Setting it up the night before meant waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee—a feature my groggy morning self has come to treasure. Programming the clock and brew time was simple, even for someone technologically challenged like my mother. However, I did notice that the buttons, while functional, could have used a slightly better tactile feel. I imagine some users might find them a tad less responsive over time.

**Performance & Brewing Experience**  
The machine brews up to five cups of coffee, which was precisely the right amount for one person or a couple. It avoids unnecessary waste and ensures the coffee doesn’t sit for hours cooling and losing flavor. The brew process itself was efficient and quiet. One small hang-up I noticed was that it’s optimized for paper filters. While that’s fine, I do prefer machines that also accommodate mesh filters to reduce ongoing costs and waste.

**Auto-Pause & Pour Feature Saves the Day**  
I’ve never been the type to patiently wait for the entire pot to brew, so the auto-pause feature was a lifesaver. Halfway through brewing, I was able to pour myself a cup without the machine dripping coffee onto the warming plate. This thoughtful touch added a layer of convenience, especially on rushed mornings. That said, the carafe’s spout design could have been better. Occasionally, a little dribble occurred when pouring, which might annoy others who value a completely mess-free experience.

**Positives**  
Several strong points make this product stand out:  
- Unobstructive, compact design perfect for small kitchens.  
- Programmable feature allows scheduling coffee up to 24 hours in advance.  
- FrontFill design minimizes spills.  
- Auto-pause lets you grab a cup mid-brew seamlessly.  

**Hurdles**  
There are a few areas for improvement:  
- Carafe pour spout can occasionally spill.  
- Buttons lack a premium tactile feel.  
- Exclusive reliance on paper filters is less eco-friendly.  

**Ease of Use for Various Coffee Lovers**  
Over time, I’ve grown to trust the simplicity of this coffee maker. Relatives who stayed over recently commented that it was refreshingly straightforward compared to other overly complicated setups with dozens of options. If you’re someone who values ease, this is ideal. However, advanced coffee enthusiasts who lean more towards specialty brews may find the lack of custom brewing settings limiting. Additionally, the glass carafe, while standard, doesn’t provide thermal insulation—so drink the coffee quickly unless you like it cold.

**Direct Competitors**  
In comparison, the Black+Decker 5-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker and the Mr. Coffee Mini Brew are two competing products that come to mind. The Black+Decker offers slightly quieter brewing but lacks the front-fill convenience. On the other hand, the Mr. Coffee Mini Brew’s thermal carafe solves the heat retention issue but comes at a higher price point. The Hamilton Beach coffee maker, in my experience, strikes a balance between value and essential features, making it one of the best choices for budget-conscious, space-limited buyers.

**Price Performance**  
Evaluating its overall worth, I feel this compact coffee maker offers excellent value for its features. The programmable clock and auto-pause alone feel like high-end features in a streamline product like this. Not to mention, it’s robust enough for everyday use without feeling flimsy. Keeping affordability in mind, this product’s pricing plays to its strengths, offering a practical solution at a reasonable cost for small kitchens and coffee lovers.

1mxxceg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mxxceg/i_feel_like_my_heart_was_ripped_off/,I feel like my heart was ripped off,"I was in a wonderful relationship for 9 years. It ended peacefully because I moved for work to another country, we remained friends, still in contact. I took some time to heal, focused on building my new life - job, sports, travel, friends. No dating, no apps. 
When I was ready, I decided to try dating apps. Went on some dates with nice and not very nice people, it was okaish but nothing ever worked out of that, but I was fine, I didn’t feel that much connection with them anyway. 

This June I met with a guy. He liked me on all dating apps, we matched. He was very honest, fun, easy to talk to, very respectful and attractive. He initiated the date, we walked 6 hours talking non stop. It was amazing, I was feeling so, so happy. He said multiple times that he is not looking for a relationship right now, and not ready for serious. I said okay, me too, I’m still recovering from the past experiences and willing to see how it goes. He also said he sees other people, and it was honest and fair, since I was doing it too, like, talking with others, meeting for coffee, nothing more. But he was quite open that he has also a casual physical stuff with other people. On the second date he kissed me, we spent together whole day, while he kept telling me to not get attached, and stuff like that. We had a talk, that he doesn’t want to hurt me, that he likes me and I’m brave and smart and he wants to be careful with my feelings.. 
The third date wasn’t even a date. I tried to take his hand, he rejected me, then we had those long talk about him not being ready, not being able to give me what I want, blablabla. 

After the third date he banned “spicy chats” and explained it that he sees that I want more in terms of the relationship and he can’t give me that, doesn’t want a relationship, etc, so we better not to continue with this topic. I said okay, let’s just get to know each other better. 
After some days of no contact, I wrote that I miss him. And he replied with his fav “I don’t want to hurt you, it’s too fast for me, you got attached too quickly, it’s wrong, I don’t want that, let’s be friends”. I asked upfront - tell me if you don’t like me, don’t see any future of whatever this is, and we will just stop here. He said no, it’s not that, I like you, we vibe, it’s just goes too fast for him. I said okay, then we will slow down, let’s just talk as friends, go for walks, get to know each other better. 
After this we texted as friends, but he still randomly flirted with me. He said he was having some problems and I was always there for him, I care, I wanted him to know that he doesn’t have to face it all alone, if he needs anyone - I’m here. I offered to meet 3-4 times and every time was rejected: low social battery, already had plans, etc.. Okay, I’m not stupid, I saw and felt where it goes, I just wanted a clarity and closure, if it’s the end. I gave him time, space, joke with him when the energy of his texts was right.. 
This Monday I unexpectedly lost my job and 2 days later got diagnosed with depression. Everything I wanted is to talk to him. He replied but he didn’t care much. And yesterday I sent him a silly photo based on our inside jokes from the past, and it all somehow went down the rabbit hole. He said he is in the process of getting to know someone deeper, so he can’t respond, and this was a knife in my heart. Of course I felt his energy was off, but he was so open and honest from the beginning, that I trusted him when he said he just have some problems. I trusted him to tell me if he will have someone else, because that’s an instant end for me. I was hurt enough and I just proceed to text him that his “doesn’t want a relationship” always has a silent “with you” in the end. And that it would be great if he said it openly as soon as he felt it. He accused me of crossing the line he draw about spicy talks(well, he liked it, he responded to it, and it were never really spicy talks anymore, I was just sending memes). So in the end I wrote a huge raw message with everything I wanted to tell him: why I fell so fast, how much I liked and trusted him, that I was ready to do anything to make it work because it was something special, and that I never wanted to lose him over something silly. Etc. There were no accusations, no blaming, I just sent my raw emotions because I couldn’t keep them inside anymore. 
He said that this is extremely manipulative and he doesn’t want a contact anymore. I feel like I was punched in a gut. He blocked me everywhere. I just wanted to tell him what I feel because his “I need space” required from me a whole planning of what and when I can write him. 
How can honestly and clearness be named a manipulation? I swear this is what hurts even more than the fact that he had someone all this time he was keeping me on leash.

We need these criminals sent to hell. We need these child abusing monsters to eat dirt. We need pedophiles to be exposed and sentenced to life in prisons, preferably those with higher populations of people who hate child molesters. I want to see every person who raped and abused me suffer in prison just like the made me feel my entire life. I want these people to be so mentally fatigued it’s like their brains were ground up and dehydrated like coffee beans. I want them to be so miserable that their unempathetic sociopathic minds finally for once understand what it was like to be the victim of their abuse like all those children and other innocents. 

God dammit I just want all of the sociopaths who have zero remorse for the things they’ve done to literally be executed. I want them dead. They have no purpose being alive and all these people that give such weak answers like “no that’s inhumane” FUCK THAT. YOU WANNA KNOW WHATS INHUMANE?! MY ENTIRE GOD DAMNED LIFE HAS BEEN AN ABUSED NIGHTMARE.

God damn these people who have abused me. Please God can any one save us. I hate this weak and pathetic country being overrun by faggots and jews. God dammit all. Every crime ever commuted has benefited the most evil of human society. All the psychopaths and pedophiles, all the degenerates and criminals. Even now as I type these posts I swear they’re just laughing. They’re mocking me and all of us who’ve been victimized by these atrocious excuses for humanity. Pathetic cowards.

Even through all of the abuse, torment, and torture that I endured the one thing that upsets me the most is that most people are unaware these things even happen. My whole life I was obviously displaying signs of distress and child abuse and yet NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON WAS ABLE TO PUT AN END TO THEIR ABUSE.

It’s all so easy says the movies and tv shows. “Just call 911 and they’ll solve anything!” So how come when I call the bastards they laugh at me. They’re all corrupt. They’re all in on it. This evil government in fact goes all the way to the top of this shithole of a country. GOD DAMMIT ALL.

1mxx9x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1mxx9x4/new_ssd_sometimes_disappearing_from_pcie_nvme/,"New SSD sometimes disappearing from PCIe NVMe (PCIe Gen4, running in PCIe Gen3 slot)","I recently got a new 2TB WD\_BLACK SN7100 NVMe SSD for my Laptop. With some help from ChatGPT and some trial and error I found a suspect: when the laptop is in power mode this NEVER happens. If I use any sort of energy saving mode it will occur at some point. Good to know - but I don't want to use my laptop in power mode all the time, especially not when I'm using it for watching movies. Right now all of this is not too much of an issue, because the WD is only used for large video and audio files (Video editing / audio recording) that are only required when the Power Mode is on anyway. But my plan is to cleanly re-install Windows and all Software on there as well, because I want to have the speed benefits of my PCIe NVME Slot vs the old SATA SSD I'm currently using for the System and all Software. I'm afraid this could also happen when the WD is used as C:. Chat GPT suggested this would probably not be an issue because Windows doesn't kill the system Drive, but I'm a bit sceptical and cautios. I don't want to loose Data from these Shutdowns. Can I trust Windows to not ""loose"" its OS drive because of some stupid power Saving setting? I'm grateful for any additional tips or fixes that might work. Otherwise some assurance that this won't happen as an OS drive would be nice as well. Sorry for my weirdly structured post, I'm not a native speaker and also not a expert in tech stuff - just an artist relying on that stuff...  
  
**Here are the basic facts and things I've tried (summarized by Chat GPT, slightly edited and corrected):**  
  
System specs

* **Laptop Barebone:** Clevo PB50/PB70 (rebranded by DAX Audio Solutions, similar to XMG PRO 15 M19)
* **BIOS version:** 1.07.14RTR1
* **EC version:** 1.07.12TRC1
* **Chipset:** Intel (Coffee Lake platform, PCIe Gen3 only)
* **SSD:** WD Black NVMe (PCIe Gen4, running in PCIe Gen3 slot)
* **OS:** Windows 11

# Things I already tried / checked

* **BIOS detects the SSD** → so the drive is not dead.
* **Windows Fast Startup is disabled** (option not even available, since Hibernate is off).
* **Restart vs. Shutdown behavior tested** → drive is missing even after a Windows *restart* in Power Mode, but always shows up after a full *shutdown + cold boot*.
* **Windows power plan adjustments**:
   * Set “Turn off hard disk after” = Never.
   * Disabled PCIe Link State Power Management.
   * Disabled other power-saving features (sleep states for storage/PCIe).
   * Tried High Performance / Balanced / custom plan.
* **Checked Device Manager & Disk Management**: when the drive is missing, it does not show up at all (not just “no drive letter”).
* **Updated firmware & driver state**:
   * WD Dashboard reports SSD firmware is up to date.
   * WD doesn’t provide a separate NVMe driver → using Microsoft Standard NVMe driver.
   * Ran Intel Driver & Support Assistant → only found outdated Bluetooth & iGPU drivers; Chipset/ME/RST are up to date.
* **Verified it’s not Windows Fast Startup** (issue persists after disabling).
* **BIOS Fast Boot**: not available in my BIOS menu (so can’t toggle).
* **Windows Event Viewer checked** → no persistent disk errors besides the missing detection after restart.
* **SSD is installed in the primary M.2 slot (CPU-attached, Gen3 x4)** → already confirmed to be the “faster” slot.
* **Confirmed compatibility**: PCIe Gen4 drive in Gen3 slot (should work fine, backwards-compatible).",1,1755942648.0,techsupport,2,1.0,False

1mxx4ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Desperate_Target8380/comments/1mxx4ks/am_i_an_asshole_because_i_asked_a_guy_to_pay/,Am I an asshole because I asked a guy to pay whenever we are together?,"Backstory: I’m 28 female and the guy is 31 male. We met at work. As soon as we started talking we knew that we were attracted to each other. He is from another state and was living in Airbnb. He doesn’t have a car so he takes the bus to work. And I live 1hr away from the work place which is in a different city. When we started talking he mentioned that his Airbnb is in my city near my apartment, so naturally I was curious since my apartment is 1hr away. After two weeks of talking he asked me to show him around the city because he is new to the city. I initially was apprehensive about the idea but agreed. I took him to my apartment and let him sleep on my couch. At this time I also have plans to leave my apartment and didn’t want to pay 2k to break my lease so I had a great idea of letting him take over my lease. He agreed to the idea so i asked him to pay rent on the beginning of the month and said i will leave immediately if he makes the payment. He said he will pay me when we get our paycheck. We get paid every week so i agreed. So when he didn’t make payments for the beginning of this month, i decided to pay the rent since it was due. Then i told him since you didn’t pay me yet i will move out in the middle of month so I have time to move my stuff without rushing. I told him that he can pay half and I will leave when he paid his share, so that it’s half and half. Rent is $1500 so he would have to pay $750, that’s not including electricity which I already paid for as well. When we got paid again on the second week of the month, he only paid me $400. So ok, I thought maybe he’s behind but that’s okay, he promised to pay me the rest the next paycheck. He is living in my apartment now and I’m driving us to work every work days and driving us around town. I buy the groceries and cook for us and packed his lunch for him. While all these going on, our relationship gotten closer and we became intimate and he expressed that he loves me. So then I thought we are getting closer to a relationship. I told him that I’m not into guys who vape or smoke weed because I don’t do those things myself. He told me he will quit if I agree to be his gf. I didn’t respond but he stopped doing those things anyway so I thought maybe I should give him a chance. The first time we went out to a restaurant, the check comes out and I paid thinking he still need to pay me the rest of the rent and if he pays for the check it will take longer for him to pay me. And second time we go out again, I paid again, I didn’t mind but I have never paid for anything in my past relationships so the feelings were weird and I didn’t understand it at first. The third time I paid again and I felt weird but didn’t understand it. At this place, he tried to touch me and kiss me but I pulled away. Then after thinking about what happened, I realized that I get the ick from paying for something when im with a man that I’m seeing. It makes me feel less feminine. I didn’t know this because like I said, I have never paid for anything when I’m with my man in my past relationships. So later that day, I brought it up to him. I said “when you tried to touch me and kiss me at this place and I pulled away because I felt an ick. And it’s from paying for stuff lately and I didn’t realize or understand it at first but now I just realized it. And the reason is, it made me feel less feminine. So from now on I’ll let you pay and if you’re not comfortable with paying, we will pay for our own stuff or you pay and I’ll wire you the money. The action of paying in front of a man im with gives me the ick and makes me feel less feminine.” He instantly shifted his energy and I felt it. He left the bedroom and went to sleep on the couch. Then next morning we had an argument. He said from his perspective, he thought I was making a nice gesture by paying and all that was fake since I had brought up the conversation. I told him no it was not fake because I actually wanted to do it. It’s like wanting to give a man a massage at first, the first time it’s great, it comes out of wanting to do something nice then the third time and fourths times I realized that I actually don’t like giving massages and changed my mind. I told him I’m allowed to like something and changed my mind later. He didn’t take it very well, and still caught up on the idea of me being fake because all those times I paid he thought it was a nice gesture that I’m doing for him and now it’s all fake. Mind you I never said I regret paying those times. I said moving forward we will do it differently because I just now realized that I actually don’t like doing that. Then he brought up some random dude losing his job and his wife was going and talking behind his back about leaving him. Then he had the audacity to talk about women leaving their husbands the moment their husband no longer has a stable job. This conversation just pushed me to my limits at this point because how can he compare me to a woman I don’t even know or care about. Then he went on about women are shallow and just use men for money. I’m shaking my head even writing this 🤦🏻‍♀️ For the next three days he wouldn’t let it go. He would rub it in my face whenever we go out. For example, I was talking about going to this one place that has really good food and he said oh yeah I went there with my friends and they paid for me. Then one time I was asking if he was going to take out his wallet to pay and I’ll pay him back, he said “ill pay, I wouldn’t want you to feel less feminine” or he would say things like “I don’t care about money as much as you do.” Even though I told him multiple times, it’s not about money, it’s the action that gives me the ick. We would argue about the same thing for 3 days straight because he refused to see where I’m coming from. I’m a traditional woman and grew up with my traditional culture of a man talking care of their women. He still thinks I’m in the wrong for thinking that my man should pay when I’m with him and if he can’t afford it, I’ll transfer the money. He said a woman can do things that is a nice gesture for a man. Yes I can do nice gestures and buy things when my man isn’t with me and I’m out by myself. If he isn’t with me while I’m out, I can buy him coffee as a nice gesture. I have done that for him. It’s only when I’m with him. Then he said me saying I feel less feminine when paying is like setting a condition to a dynamic of a relationship. He said “it’s like saying, I’ll only feel feminine if a man pays for stuff.” Then he continued asking “what if a husband said I’ll only go to work if my wife gives me head” that was a stupid comparison. But when I brought up all the time i cooked and packed his lunch and asked if that was not enough of nice gestures for him and what more does he want from me. And from all this, I just instantly get the ick and decided to move out completely so he can take over the lease. And finally, my last straw, was when I was leaving, I was giving him one last chance to make it up by cooking him one last meal but we again have the same argument. At this point, I’m completely fed up so I went off on him. I told him I’m not the girl for him and he isn’t the guy for me. If he wants a girl that cooks, pack his lunch, cleans and pays his bills then he needs to find a girl that is willing to do that and can’t expect me to change into that. He keeps saying he wants a girl like me as his wife but he isn’t willing to put in the effort to be the man I need. Make it make sense. I told him “men want a traditional wife but isn’t willing to be a traditional partner.” And if he wanted to be a princess in a relationship and have women take care of him then he needs to find one that will do that for him. I packed up all my stuff and left and told him we are done. He called me a jerk and now that Ive calm down, it makes me wonder if I’m really a jerk and if I was being unreasonable. So please tell me, am I the asshole?",1,1755942093.0,u_Desperate_Target8380,0,1.0,False

She bought a house sight unseen, without thinking it through, just like she committed to marriage with a guy she’d barely spent time or lived with, clearly out of some desperate need to ‘redeem’ herself (for the terrible sin of leaving a cheating abuser, ugh).

Then it turns out the house was fixed up only on a cosmetic level, to look nice enough, but had a lot of very foundational (expensive) issues. Similarly, she also has a husband who does surface level things to seem nice- say Christian things, bring her coffee, call her hot- but won’t provide more integral support. He let her leave her support system for him, he lets her wear herself thin hosting his friends, he doesn’t help her pay the mortgage (that she said they couldn’t pay if she wasn’t working as much as she is), he didn’t even help her move cross-country, when that was something she did for him.

There were certain things she really wanted in a new marriage, and in a house. She said in a Q&A right after the divorce that in a future relationship she never wanted to date someone who had a history of infidelity. She also said it was a mistake that she and her ex husband spent so little time together in their first year of marriage, that she doesn't recommend that and wouldn't do it again. But then she ended up with a guy who tours a lot of the year, and at best left his girlfriend for her (if not cheated with her). In a house, she really wanted a guest house to rent out; she ended up with an AUD that had to be demolished. In both cases she compromised things that seemed really important to her, didn’t get what she said she wanted.

The house is not her style, as she’s also said herself- she wants a more cottagey style, she doesn’t like how glam it is. Similarly, her husband just doesn’t seem like her kind of person. They don’t seem to have the same tastes. But she’s trying to make cosmetic changes to make her house and husband more appealing to her (like with the husband makeover) even though what she really seems to want is just... something else.

Then there’s things like how everything went wrong with the move, how all her stuff arrived broken. She had a literal landslide in her garden because it was improperly constructed.

If this were a metaphor in a movie I’d say it was a bit too on-the-nose, laid on a bit too thick. It’s like her surroundings are constantly trying to remind her that things are not working, that she’s not in the right place for her.",4,1755941777.0,micheljanseYT,0,1.0,False

Wallah this been eating at me. You got people out here calling themselves Muslim, but then turning Islam into their own personal remix. Shia slandering the Sahabah like it’s nothing. Hadith rejectors treating the Sunnah like it’s some optional side quest. Sufis inventing new rituals that were never part of the deen. Khawarij quick to call everyone a kafir while their own aqeedah is rotten. Qadianis who straight up deny the finality of the Prophet ﷺ. And some folks’ salah isn’t even valid with the stuff they deny. Yet they have the audacity to walk around acting like it’s all good.

Think about it. You spend your whole life praying, fasting, telling people “I’m Muslim.” Then the Day of Judgment comes and it’s a big fat zero. Useless. Like working at a company where your ONLY job is to clean your desk. You run around doing everything else, answer calls, mop the floor, make coffee, but you don’t clean your desk. When the boss shows up, guess what? You’re fired. Not because you didn’t work, but because you ignored the one thing he asked.

That’s what scares me. Allah gave us the deen, complete and clear. The Prophet ﷺ showed us the Sunnah. The Sahabah carried it, preserved it, and passed it down. And yet people today twist it, pick and choose, and follow sects that were never part of Islam to begin with. Fear Allah before it’s too late, because excuses aren’t gonna save you when the scales are out.",0,1755941493.0,IslamIsEasy,2,0.25,False

Well, buckle up, because I accidentally slipped into the world of passive income, and spoiler alert: it’s way less glamorous than it sounds... but totally worth it!

Here’s how it went down:

I tried to start a podcast. Mic was fancy, but my voice? Let’s just say... not podcast material.

I pivoted to affiliate marketing, hyped myself on the idea of making $$ while I sleep. Instead, it was a lot of trying, failing, and wondering if my cat could be my only audience. Spoiler: he’s a tough crowd.

THEN, I found print-on-demand t-shirts. Made a quirky design that said “I work for my coffee” — and weirdly, people loved it! Sales started trickling in while I binged Netflix.

Fast forward, you won’t believe: my “coffee worker” tees covered my streaming subscription costs, then some! ☕👕

Moral of the story? Sometimes your side hustle finds you when you’re just trying to procrastinate harder. If I can do it, so can you!

Bonus tip: Don’t promise virality. Focus on building slow, steady streams. And keep your cat for moral support. 🐱

1mxwqlp,https://i.redd.it/wbtqit90lqkf1.jpeg,"That Day I Realized ""Success"" Was Burning Me Out — And How I Changed It","
Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something personal. Two years ago, I was working 60-hour weeks at a tech startup in Berlin. My life looked “successful” on paper: great salary, fancy title, cool office. But every day felt the same—wake up, coffee, code, stress, sleep, repeat. I was constantly exhausted, disconnected from friends, and honestly? I felt empty.

One Tuesday, I hit a breaking point. I was so tired I could barely think. I left work early and went for a walk in Tiergarten. I sat on a bench near the lake, just watching people: a couple laughing, an old man feeding ducks, a girl drawing in a sketchbook.

And it hit me: I hadn’t truly seen anything in months. I was living inside a bubble of deadlines and anxiety. I was running so hard toward “success” that I forgot how to live.

So I decided to make a change. I started small:

· No checking emails after 7 PM.
· Weekends for hiking, reading, or doing nothing.
· Saying “no” to extra projects when I was overwhelmed.

It wasn’t easy. I felt guilty at first. But slowly, life started feeling… real again.

Now I work less, make a bit less money, but I’m present. I remember what sunlight feels like. I have time for people I care about.

I’m sharing this because I know many of us feel the same pressure—to be productive, to hustle, to always be “on.” Especially in Western cultures where work often defines our worth.

But what are we sacrificing? And is it worth it?

So today I went out with my best friend to finish some paperwork for her upcoming flight. While waiting, she met her uncle (they’re not super close, just see each other once a year for this stuff). He’s really nice and offered to take us to a café while we waited for her papers.

Here’s the thing: when we got there, my friend ordered food, I ordered food too, and her uncle only ordered a coffee. I instantly felt awkward because I knew he’d be paying (it’s just the dynamic) and I couldn’t help feeling like maybe he expected us to only order drinks, not full meals. And the place was kind of pricey, which added to my guilt spiral.

He didn’t say anything or act rude, but I think he looked a little annoyed? (Or maybe that’s just his normal face, I don’t know). Now I’m overthinking, should I offer to pay? Was it rude to assume he’d cover everything when he only got coffee?

*By Your Humble Handicapper, Who Still Ought to Lay Off the Time Travel Coffee*

---

**Parsing the Odds: When Math Meets Midfield Mayhem**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a defender crunching a watermelon on the sideline. The odds paint Monaco as the slight favorite, with decimal prices hovering around **2.25** (implied probability: \~**44%**). Lille checks in at **3.0** (\~**33%**), while the draw sits at **3.5** (\~**28%**). Translating this: bookmakers think Monaco has a decent shot, but they’re not betting on a Monaco landslide any more than they’d bet on a penguin winning a beach volleyball tournament.

The key stat? Monaco’s recent 3-1 shellacking of Louh Cote-d’Azur (a team name that sounds like a skincare product) vs. Lille’s 9th-place league position. But here’s the twist: Lille’s last meeting with Monaco? A 2-1 victory in February 2025. History says Lille can hang with Monaco, but history also says the Titanic thought “icebergs are just really cold party poopers.”

**Digesting the News: Giroud’s 13-Year Sabbatical and Monaco’s Existential Crisis**  
Lille’s headline act? The return of **Olivier Giroud**, a striker making a comeback after a **13-year absence**. Thirteen years! That’s not a career break—that’s a *geological era*. Was he excavating dinosaur bones? Training with time-traveling monks? Or did he just really commit to a “year in Provence” and forgot to come back? Either way, his return is either a masterstroke or a cinematic nod to *Jurassic Park*.

Monaco, meanwhile, is dealing with the existential dread of being second in the league but third in last season’s table. Confused? So is their transfer committee.

1mxwj7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mxwj7d/i_think_my_girlfriend_of_1_year_and_i_are/,I think my girlfriend of 1 year and I are fundamentally incompatible but I cannot bring myself to make the tough call. First relationship ever and I don't wanna lose her. Even though it's probably best for me.,"I'm 31M, white American, semi-retired with savings. She's 30F, from Korea, working here and trying to move toward a green card. We met through a dating app. Red flags right away, I think at one point she said she hated men, plus a bunch of random stories gossiping about people I didn't know. I hadn't been laid in 3 years, she was DTF, we slept together, and the physical intimacy felt good after a long drought. I had to fly to Seattle right after, asked her to visit, and she did. She can't drive so I drove her everywhere for a week. Honestly it was exhausting having to drive everywhere, but it was also kinda nice having her with me. Hard to explain. It was kind of a relief when she left, but I kept seeing her when I got back to NYC.

Early on, there were moments that should have told me to slow down. About 3 months in we were sitting outside a coffee shop and I suggested a simple workaround for her to travel to Korea by stacking PTO and WFH days to get ~16 days. She got weirdly hostile and I just shut up while she ranted about how I ""don't understand"" what it's like to be in her position. I honestly wanted to break up with her there and then but I told myeslf maybe this was a one-off thing so I let it slide. After about 10 months, on Valentine's Day, she flipped me off and said ""fuck you."" in public in NYC with tons of people around. Those are the two ""holy shit"" moments I had with her where she was way out of line. Each time I told myself it was a one-off. Which I guess they were, I guess.

We ended up living together at her studio. I've been living there since January. I pay her $1500/month. The apartment is tiny: two desks smashed against the bed, almost no floor space. She has way more stuff than me. Rolex, Cartier bracelet, Chanel, and endless shopping. She spends her whole paycheck on clothes and leans on her dad's card. No savings or investments. I've tried to get her to put even a little into the stock market. Nothing. Before I moved into the apartment it was barren, no TV, no furniture other than a bed, nothing. Just a bed, a cheap Ikea desk and a $10 chair. I ended up bringing my TV, bought a standing desk, shelves, etc. I also bought her a $500 Herman Miller for her birthday since she works from home. When her back started hurting she blamed the chair. I keep telling her to book a massage. Sent her the exact place and link. She refuses because she ""doesn't want a random person touching her body,"" then keeps complaining. I tell her to go to the sauna, yoga, she does nothing. She told me hates the sauna and only goes because I like it. I'm constantly trying to solve simple problems and she either ignores it or makes me the villain.

Day to day, she has no hobbies that stick. She walks a lot (in heels) like 5+ miles a day. Which is good. But she refuses to wear normal shoes. I tried to buy her a $200 pair of running shoes and she told me not to by them. No gym, no yoga, no sports, no reading. I'm at the gym for 2+ hours every day and I try to get her to come with me but she doesn't wanna come. I bought her a Dogist book because she watches those dog clips nonstop (she is on social media for like 2-3+ hours every day, mostly IG reels and this Korean social media app), and it's just collecting dust. The one time she ""read"" it was when I sat next to her, held it up, and read along. She wants to be together 24/7 and accompany me to everything. I'm in good shape and used to do intense yoga and lift daily; with her I eat worse, exercise less, sleep worse, and feel constantly interrupted. She always wants to go out and eat pasta and ice cream and shit like that but I just wanna have salads and cook at home.

She's extremely insecure and needs reassurance on loop. ""Do you like me?"" ""Do you think I'm cute?"" ""Do I need to lose weight?"" Ten times in a row is normal. If I say ""I already answered"" she cries. She asks ""you won't cheat on me right?"" constantly. I do the same shit every day. Work from home, gym, come home. I don't see my friends anymore. There's nothing to even be suspicious about, but she asks anyway. She's also jealous in weird ways. If I want to view a sublet at 9 p.m. and the sublessor is a woman, she says she's not comfortable with me going alone. I ended up bringing her. Crisis averted, but it's like that every time.

She hates spontaneity and spirals when small plans shift. One day she wanted to go to the museum at 5. We were going to be 10–15 minutes late. She panicked, then changed her mind, then forgot her dad's credit card, then canceled, then stormed out, then cried, then wanted boba, then waited for me even though I told her three times I'd bike and meet her there. We sat in silence. Later she said she ""doesn't deserve to be happy"" because she can't plan. When I suggested, ""If it's hard to decide, let me drive,"" she took it as me saying she's broken. Total communication breakdown.

The big blowups lately have been about me visiting my parents. I told her up front: I'd be gone 1–2 weeks. She keeps trying to rewrite it as ""you promised one week."" Then she tried ""it's already been three weeks."" It wasn't, I left Monday, back Friday, 2 weeks and 4 days. While I was gone she decided she wants to quit her job, and is frantically starting to apply to tons of other places. She was telling me she hates her boss. Based on the stories she tells me I don't think she's *that* bad but whatever, it's her life. But the interesting thing is now she's floating applying to jobs on the west coast. The timing felt like she sensed I don't want to stay in NYC and is trying to move with me.

Then came the call from hell. She was texting me non-stop ""are you coming back tomorrow?"" It was late here; I was in the sauna. I finally texted, ""sorry im still figuring it out... would you hate me if i came back sat?"" That one sentence detonated a two-hour call. She said I ""never keep my words,"" she's ""so fucking frustrating,"" ""you were asking if you can break your word,"" and literally compared me asking to come back Saturday to asking ""can I cheat on you?"" I kept saying ""I'm coming Friday."" She kept saying ""you were not planning to do that just now,"" ""you have to change,"" ""I can't do this forever,"" and ""I deserve someone who really likes me."" She said ""you shouldn't have asked."" At one point she told me to get a hotel if I came back Friday because she didn't want to see me. Then she flipped back to ""I want to see you tomorrow."" Then back again. It was whiplash. I booked the Friday flight and sent her the itinerary.

Next day my first flight got delayed by 1.5 hours, I missed the connection, and I had to push to the next day. She kept telling me how disappointed she was. ""Plan better."" She conceded it wasn't my fault, then added, ""MAAAYBE book a longer layover."" So now anything less than a 2‑hour layover is off the table? There's no winning here. At least she wasn't in hysterics and crying and yelling and shit... but still. This shit is so fucking frustrating. Every time something doesn't go right, even if it's not my fault, she finds a way to criticize me or make it my fault. I just want a normal girlfriend who makes my life better, not one who is constantly dragging me down.

She has zero tolerance for uncertainty. If I don't confirm a flight days ahead, she spirals. If I ask a question to check in with her ""would you hate me if I came back Sat?"" that alone becomes grounds for a meltdown. If I apologize and commit to the original date, she moves the goalposts. If I meet the goalpost, she brings up old grievances. If I clear those, she accuses me of ""twisting"" or ""not caring."" Then, after I jump through the hoops, she flips and says ""it's okay, come Saturday,"" which feels like a trap so it can be used against me later. I'm tired of living inside a logic puzzle. I used to have a nice, calm, drama free life before this. Now every other day there's a new crisis and I'm the villain unless I read her mind in advance.

Recently she told me she loves me. I don't think I love her. She can feel it. She gets really sad about that.

A few more context points because I know Reddit will ask. She told me she didn't start dating until 29 because she ""hated men."" She sometimes brings up the green card thing, and asks ""you wanna be with me for a long time right?"" ""you're not gonna dump me right?"" She doesn't really have friends here. She gets upset if I try to do things on my own. She calls me selfish if I don't text back when I'm going to bed. If she's upset, I have to stay up and reassure her or it becomes ""you don't care about me."" She says ""I'm trying my best to go with your way,"" but in practice it feels like any attempt to negotiate or ask a simple question is me ""not keeping my words.""

For fairness: she's taught me some Korean, pressured me into cleaning up better, and I've cut weed down to once a week because she hates it. She can be sweet. But the day-to-day feels like walking through landmines. I keep asking myself why I let this get serious. The honest answer is it started because I hadn't had sex in years, she was DTF on date one, and I kept going even though I knew we weren't compatible. When I found out she never really had a longterm boyfriend before I thought that was kind of nice, since we were on the same footing kinda, and both could learn from eachother. Now it's a year+ later and I live at her place. If I even suggest viewing a place alone, she flips. If I say I need space, she begs. If I try to hold a boundary, she cries or threatens break-up, then says she didn't ""threaten,"" she's ""protecting herself.""

I don't want to do this anymore. But at the same time I don't want to remove her from my life. I never had a girlfriend this serious before and she never had a boyfriend this serious before and it's just so nice to have someone on your side. I know if I break up with her I will probably never see her again and that really sucks. She told me as much.

Questions for people who've dealt with this kind of thing:

* If you were me, would you lock in a sublet first and then tell her, or give her a heads-up before I have a place and risk getting walked back into the same cycle?
* Am I crazy for thinking the constant goalpost moving, accusations over tiny scheduling asks, and the ""it's okay come Saturday"" then ""actually don't come"" flip is manipulative? Because it feels insane from the inside.
* How the fuck do I actually *do* this? I have been contemplating this for a LONG time and I'm too weak to actually do it. There's nobody to hold me accountable which I feel like is the biggest issue.

tl;dr: Met on a dating app, moved too fast, ignored early red flags (""I hate men,"" verbal blowups, constant jealousy/insecurity). Now I live at her place and every week brings a new meltdown over tiny planning things.

1mxwgtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mxwgtz/who_called_in_the_fleet/,Who Called in the Fleet?,"Dusk on Planet X-734 was a disquieting shade of purple.

Two suns hung in the sky—one a dying, jaundiced yellow, the other a pale, young white. Their light wrestled and bled together, finally settling into an almost illusory violet that washed over the rocky world the Imperium had named Prometheus.

Private Alex Ryder took a sip of lukewarm synth-coffee, the familiar, inescapable, bitter metallic tang of it sliding down his throat.

He was posted toholshols Lookout Three, the outermost watchtower of the base, a lonely box of reinforced plaster and armored glass. Below him, his shadow stretched long and thin across the ground, distorted by the purple light.

“Hey, Marcus. How’s the view from your end?” Alex asked lazily into his helmet’s built-in comms. “I bet you’re staring at those holssquad-matesquad-mate of Dr. Eva Jensen again.”

A light chuckle came back through the static. It squad-matestar-fleetsstar-fleetsquadmate, Corporal Marcus.

“Shut it, rookie. What the doctor does is art. A grunt like you who only appreciates guns and ration packs wouldn’t get it.” Marcus’s voice crackled with a smug amusement. “Seriously, though, this place gives me the creeps after a while. All these purple rocks… they start to look like eyes.”

“Come on, you’ve just seen too many horror flicks.” Alex laughed, about to fire back another joke.

And then, everything changed.

A sharp, piercing shriek of static exploded in his ears, drowning out Marcus’s voice completely.

It wasn’t normal interference. It felt like something was scraping its nails across the surface of his brain.

Beneath the noise, he thought he heard something else… whispers that couldn't be described in any human language, chaotic and mad, as if bubbling up from some deep abyss.

A violent headache seized him, a white-hot spike driving through his temples.

He grunted, the coffee mug slipping from his grasp and shattering on the armored floor.

The purple world before him began to twist and spin, collapsing into a single, pure point of all-consuming black.

His last thought before consciousness abandoned him was: *Marcus…*

Alex awoke to the gentle, mechanical chime of a medical diagnostic.

“Vital signs stable. Neural interface nominal. Continued observation recommended.”

He opened his eyes to the milky-white interior of a med-bay pod, a diagnostic panel blinking green above him. A dead silence permeated the air, broken only by the tireless flash of red emergency lights that sliced the room into fragments of shadow and light.

He sat up, feeling weak but otherwise unharmed. He looked down at himself, and his heart seized. A massive hole had been torn in the abdomen of his “Defender” Mark V combat suit. The edges were melted as if by some powerful acid, then violently ripped apart. It was a terrifying wound.

Yet, through the breach, he saw not mangled flesh, but flawless skin. A strange scar traced a path from his left abdomen to his right rib. It wasn’t raised or jagged like a normal scar; it was perfectly smooth, like polished obsidian, and under the red emergency lights, it seemed to shimmer with a faint, crystalline sheen.

He couldn’t remember a thing. His memory ended with the skull-splitting headache in the watchtower. How had he gotten back to the base? How had he ended up in this automated med-pod?

“Marcus?” he called out tentatively, but the comms channel returned only a dead, suffocating silence.

A cold dread gripped him. He pushed the med-pod’s hatch open, his boots meeting the cold metal floor. The red lights threw his shadow long against the wall, the silhouette of a silent ghost.

The entire base was unnervingly quiet.

Alex stepped out of the med-bay, his hands tightening around the pulse rifle he’d grabbed from the weapons rack. The corridors were empty. Only the sound of his own footsteps echoed off the metal walls, making the space feel vast and vacant. A holographic screen on the wall was still playing an Impestar-fleetstargetstargetsganda loop—heroic starfleets cruising through the endless void—but the silent display now seemed utterly grotesque.

He reached the mess hall. Trays of half-eaten food still sat on the tables. A glass of water lay toppled over, its contents long since evaporated into a dry stain. It was as if someone had hit a pause button on life itself, and everyone had simply vanished.

Fighting down the rising panic, he moved toward the command center. It was the heart of the base, the place where most of the crew would have been. The automated door hissed open, and the sight within made his pupils constrict.

They were all there, still at their stations. Operators, comms technicians, officers… all frozen in the middle of their duties, as if they might resume typing at any second. But they were all dead.

Alex walked forward, trembling. He saw Marcus. His friend was slumped over the comms console, eyes wide open, his face a mask of an indescribable, ultimate terror. Black, dried blood had trickled from his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, but there wasn't a single physical wound on his body.

Alex checked the others. It was the same story for every single one of them.

This wasn’t a battle. It wtargetsinsecticideinsecticidesacre. A silent, invisible slaughter that targeted not the body, but the soul.

After the fear came the training. The soldier’s instinct took over Alex’s body. He had to figure out what the hell had happened here.

He started by trying to recover the security logs. Most of the data had been corrupted by a massive energy pulse during the event, but he managed to salvage a few garbled clips from a physically shielded backup server.

He hit play.

On the holographic display, the command center was operating normally.

Marcus was wearing his headset, the same smile on his face from their last conversation. Suddenly, every person in the frame, all at the same instant, grabbed their heads. Their bodies convulsed violently. The silent footage screamed with an agony that transcended sound.

A few seconds later, they collapsed at their posts, bleeding from every orifice, and moved no more.

Alex held his breath, zooming in and advancing the footage frame by frame. Just after everyone fell, a blurry shadow, almost perfectly camouflaged against the background, flickered at the edge ofinsecticide“Psyche-Mineral,”, ""“Psyche-Mineral,”, ""ra’s view.

It was impossibly fast, and its shape… was insectoid.

*Insects?* Alex’s heart sank. He immediately turned to the science terminal and entered his top-level security override—an emergency code every member of the Pioneer Corps was required to memorize.

Buried under geological surveys and atmospheric reports, he found a file flagged “TOP SECRET.” Its title was: *Preliminary Analysis of the Indigenous Crystalline Mineral, “Psyche-Mineral“Psyche-Mineral,”, ""*FELTFELT*4.*

He scanned the report. It stated that the purple crystal, dubbed “Psyche-Mineral,” possessed a unique property: it coulFELTveinsveinsesonate with and amplify the brainwaves of higher life-forms. The Imperium had hoped to harness it for a new generation of FTL communication. But at the end of the report, Chief Scientist Dr. Eva Jensen had added a warning in bold, red font:

*“…Initial simulations indicate that should the mineral’s energy field reach a certain threshold, the resonant effect will cease to be benign. It will generate a ‘Psychic Screveinspowerful enough to instantly destroy the nervous systems of all carbon-based life within its radius. The energy readings from the vein we are currently mining are rising abnormally. I strongly recommend an immediate cessation of all mining operations…”*

The report was dated the day of the disaster.

A chill ran down Alex’s spine. He finally understood. Their mining had awakened something lethal.

So why was he the only one alive?

On a hunch, he returned to the med-bay and pulled up the diagnostic logs from his time in the pod.

The records showed that while he was unconscious, medical probes had detected fragments of his combat suit’s composite armor fusing with an unknown, highly active biological tissue at the wound site.

A new, semi-organic, semi-crystalline symbiotic structure was forming.

It hit him like a lightning strike, connecting all the pieces.

The armor of the watchtower had weakened the initial psychic blast, leaving him only severely wounded and unconscious. As he fell, a tiny shard of the Psyche-Mineral, perhaps contaminated with the insect’s biological matter, must have fallen into his open wound.

The mineral had killed everyone. And in some way he couldn't possibly comprehend, it had also healed and changed him. He was no longer entirely human.

To test his theory, and to scavenge for supplies, Alex had to go outside.

He donned a spare combat suit, pulse rifle in hand, and stepped cautiously into the purple wilderness. The twin suns cast the jagged rocks into monstrous, claw-like shadows.

He was inspecting an external power relay station when he saw them for the first time.

There were a few of them, creatures the size of large dogs, their bodies encased in a glossy, obsidian-like carapace that reflected the purple light.

They had no eyes. Their heads were a complex array of mandibles and sensory antennae, and their six bladed limbs moved silently across the ground.

They emerged from behind a massive purple crystal, “staring” at him in a way that transcended sight.

Alex immediately raised his rifle, but they didn’t attack. They just watched him, their heads tilted in silent assessment, before melting back into the shadows.

His skin crawled. These things were intelligent. They were observing him. Evaluating him.

The feeling of being watched didn’t leave him, even after he returned to the base. Worse, he began to “hear” things. Not with his ears, but directly in his mind. It was a cold, emotionless stream of thought fragments, like a flood of countless tiny voices.

*“…Hunger…” “…Rage…” “…One… still lives…”*

Then, a clearer, more powerful will—regal and commanding—cut through the noise.

**“INTRUDER… DESECRATES THE GOD-BODY… MUST… PURGE…”**

*God-body?* Alex understood instantly. To these creatures, who fed on the Psyche-Mineral and perhaps even used it to form their hive mind, the humans’ mining operation was nothing less than the destruction of their nest, the desecration of their god.

And he, Alex Ryder, was the last intruder on their holy ground.

Escape was impossible. There were no ships in orbit, and the nearest Imperial starlane was light-years away. The only hope was the device in the deepest part of the base—the Planetary Pulse Beacon.

It was the ultimate distress call, a device capable of sending a signal across faster-than-light channels directly to the Sector Fleet Command. But activating it required a colossal amount of energy, and once the charging sequence began, the massive energy wave it produced would be like a torch lit in a dark room, drawing every single bug on the planet straight to him.

He had no other choice.

He went to the command center and activated the base’s Tactical Support AI. A soft blue light glowed to life on the main console, forming a slowly rotating geometric shape.

“Tactical Support AI ‘Hera,’ at your service, Acting Base Commander,” a calm, pleasant synthetic voice announced.

“Hera, report base status.”

“Energy reserves at thirty-seven percent. Automated defense systems are offline. Most external sensors are damaged. Life support is nominal.”

“What do I need to activate the Planetary Pulse Beacon?”

“Three ‘Solaris-Heart’ power cores must be installed into the beacon’s energy conversion matrix. There are five spare cores in the storage depot. I also advise you to repair at least seventy percent of the automated defense systems. Otherwise, your probability of survival against a full-scale swarm assault is zero.”

Hera’s avatar projected a base schematic and a resource checklist into the air.

“By my calculations,” she continued, “once the beacon begins its charging sequence, the energy wave will be detected by the swarm within three minutes and twelve seconds. The first wave of their assault will arrive in approximately seventeen minutes. The beacon requires three hours to fully charge and transmit. Good luck, Private Ryder.”

Three hours. He had to stand alone against the fury of an entire world.

For the next few days, Alex was more machine than man.

By day, he piloted the base’s last remaining engineering drone, moving like a worker ant inside and outside the compound.

He had to risk leaving the relative safety of the base, venturing out to abandoned depots and relay stations to find the parts and power cores needed to repair the defenses.

Every trip was a race against death.

The swarm’s scouts were like shadows, always appearing where he least expected them.

He fought them in close quarters in narrow maintenance tunnels and was chased across open plains by dozens at a time.

The symbiont in his body gave him superhuman reflexes and regenerative abilities. After every fight, the strange scar on his abdomen would glow faintly, healing his wounds.

But the more lethal threat was in his mind.

The swarm’s Overmind intensified its psychic attacks. The whispers became full-blown hallucinations.

He would see Marcus, covered in blood, standing before him, demanding to know why he was the only one who survived. He would hear his old commanding officer ordering him to lay down his arms and surrender.

“Alex, your heart rate is critical. Adrenaline levels are dangerously high. Please remain calm.” Whenever he was on the verge of breaking, Hera’s cool voice would cut through his comms like ice water, pulling him back from the brink. “Those are false neural signals. They have no physical reality.”

“Thanks, Hera,” he would gasp in response.

“You are welcome. As per my primary directive, ensuring your physiological and psychological well-being is a top priority.”

With Hera’s guidance, he worked like a master engineer. He repaired nine of the twelve automated turrets surrounding the base, laid a network of high-yield mines along the main approach, and reactivated the electromagnetic fence capable of vaporizing flesh in an instant.

He had forged the base into a lonely, heavily armed fortress.

The time had come.

Alex stood in the command center and took a deep breath. He slotted the three “Solaris-Heart” power cores into the beacon’s energy matrix, one by one.

“Hera, start the clock.”

“Acknowledged.”

He slammed his hand down on the red activation panel, the button that meant both hope and annihilation.

The entire base began to hum with a low thrum, like a great beast stirring from its slumber. On the roof, the massive antenna array unfolded, and a visible beam of pale blue energy lanced into the purple sky.

“Energy wave detected. Estimated time until swarm main assault: sixteen minutes, fifty seconds,” Hera stated, her voice as calm as ever.

Alex walked to the massive observation window and stared at the horizon.

The wait felt like a century. Finally, a black line appeared where the purple sky met the jagged earth. The line grew thicker, wider, surging forward like a tidal wave of living darkness.

“They’re here,” Alex said softly, his hands gripping his pulse rifle.

The first wave was a tide of tens of thousands of warrior drones. They threw themselves at the base with suicidal fury, swarming over the minefield. Orbs of orange fire erupted across the black sea, tearing countless bugs to pieces. Then the turrets roared to life, spitting a rain of superheated plasma that carved burning furrows through the swarm. The electromagnetic fence sizzled, turning anything that touched it to ash.

The first wave was held back. For now.

But Alex felt no relief. He knew that was just the appetizer.

The second wave came faster and hit harder. From the swarm’s ranks emerged massive creatures the size of armored vehicles—“Siege Bugs.” Their carapaces were too thick for the turret fire. They slammed into the energy nodes of the fence like living battering rams.

Sparks flew. Overload alarms blared through the command center.

“Warning! Energy nodes Three, Five, and Seven destroyed! Fence breach detected!”

The black tide poured through the gap, and the turrets’ fire was instantly divided. More Siege Bugs charged forward, using their massive pincers to rip the turrets from their foundations.

In less than ten minutes, the outer defenses had completely collapsed.

Alex had no choice but to fall back to the command center and seal the final blast door. He could hear a cacophony of sickening, high-pitched screeches and the sound of claws scraping against the thick alloy.

“Hera, how much longer on the beacon?”

“Remaining time: twenty-seven minutes.”

Alex leaned against the cold wall and let out a bitter laugh. Twenty-seven minutes. It felt like an eternity.

“Warning! Main power depleted. Switching to auxiliary reserves. All non-essential systems are now offline.”

The lights overhead died, plunging the room into near darkness, lit only by the faint glow of the console and the red emergency strobes. The turrets fell silent. The impacts on the blast door grew louder, and spiderweb cracks began to spread across its surface.

Finally, with a deafening boom, the door was torn from its hinges. A giant Siege Bug forced its way halfway into the room, corrosive drool dripping from its complex mandibles.

Alex roared, maxing out the power on his pulse rifle and unloading the entire energy cell into the creature’s head. After a full volley, the beast shrieked and collapsed, its massive corpse blocking the doorway.

But he knew it was only a temporary reprieve. More bugs would crawl over the body of their dead comrade.

He slumped against the console, wounded and out of ammo. He watched the charging bar on the holographic display creep forward, time itself seeming to slow to a crawl.

Just then, a smaller, faster bug darted through a gap in the dead Siege Bug’s corpse. It shattered the observation window and lunged, its sharp talons a black blur aimed straight for Alex’s face.

It was over.

“Private Alex Ryder,” Hera said calmly with her last ounce of power. “It has been an honor to serve with you.”

Just as the bug’s talons were about to pierce Alex’s eyes, the entire world was seized by an invisible hand.

Time didn’t freeze, but all motion became meaningless.

Outside the window, the light of the dying yellow sun began to warp unnaturally.

A force that defied all known laws of physics, an absolute gravity, descended upon the land.

The bug before Alex, the swarm behind it, the base beneath his feet, the purple rocks and the very ground they stood on… all of it was torn into countless pieces, which then began to float slowly, silently, into the air.

It was like a grand, silent ceremony for some forgotten god.

Alex floated in the zero-gravity wreckage of the command center. Through the shattered dome, he saw space.plasterplaster

In the deep black, a ripple of azure blue spread outward, as if a god had tossed a pebble into the calm lake of the cosmos.

A ship emerged from the center of the ripple.

It was too big.

So vast it blotted out the sky, swallowing the light of the suns whole.

Its hull was a mountain range of obsidian and starlight, its lines sleek and brutal, radiating an aura of overwhelming power.

On its prow, the main cannon—a “God’s Wrath” class weapon capable of shattering continents with a single shot—glowed with a destructive, incandescent white light.

An Imperial Fleet “Monarch”-class Battlecruiser.

The Modern Bahrain Business Environment\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. and Forbes Business, Bahrain’s economy expanded by 3.8% in the first quarter of 2025. Non-oil sectors—especially fintech, logistics, and professional services—now outpace hydrocarbons in attracting FDI.\
In places like Bahrain Bay, startups and international firms mix with homegrown majors, all attracted by:\
\
0% personal income tax and very low corporate tax rates\
100% foreign ownership for most sectors (ownership details here)\
Streamlined company formation processes (company formation procedures)\
\
Surprisingly, the “majlis” hospitality culture still thrives. I’ve finalized more partnerships over dates and coffee in Seef District than over contracts. But even behind this traditional veneer, Bahrain’s regulatory climate is all business.\
2025 Sustainability & ESG: Where Bahrain Is Heading\
The ESG Mandate: New Rules for New Times\
2025 brought a major shift. On January 10, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (MOICT) enacted the Bahrain Sustainability Disclosure Regulation (BSDR). This requires all public companies—and, for the first time, certain private LLCs over BHD 1 million in annual turnover—to publicly file annual ESG reports.\
\
“From 2025, no serious investor will even look at your business plan unless your ESG compliance is crystal clear.”\
—Local adviser, Diplomatic Area\
\
Key 2025 sustainability requirements:\
\
Mandatory ESG reporting: All companies meeting the new BSDR thresholds must submit audited ESG reports via the Sijilat portal by March 31 each year.\
Green office standards: New leases in Bahrain Bay, Seef, and Amwaj now often require energy efficiency certifications.\
Waste management: New regulations from the Supreme Council for Environment (SCE) enforce strict e-waste and plastic reduction practices.\
Formally documented supply chain policies: Businesses must show responsible sourcing, especially for products exported to the EU or USA.\
\
How Bahrain Compares With the UAE and Saudi Arabia\
\
Bahrain’s ESG rules apply more broadly to SMEs than the UAE, which is still mostly focused on listed entities.\
Saudi Arabia enforces ESG for public companies only (for now), while Bahrain’s approach includes key private sector players.\
\
Frankly, Bahrain now stands out for the practicality of its sustainability rules. Implementation is paired with clear guidance and strong digital reporting tools—no surprise, given Tamkeen’s and EDB’s focus on making compliance workable rather than just punishment-driven.\
Bahrain Company Formation: Step-by-Step ESG Compliance\
Step 1: Selecting Your Business Structure (With ESG In Mind)\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration., SPC (Single Person Company), Branch, or more. (See detailed breakdowns here.)\
Key tip:\
Pick a structure that matches your ESG ambitions. The WLL format lets you ring-fence liability and is best if you’re planning sustainability-linked financing or need flexibility for reporting.\
SPC is perfect for solo founders aiming for quick compliance, but for multi-stakeholder ESG goals, WLL or even a Bahrain Free Zone entity may be better (Free Zone entity information).\
Step 2: Preparing Your Sustainability Documentation\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation..\
Document checklist:\
\
ESG Policy Statement (template available from Tamkeen)\
Environmental Risk Assessment (you’ll need an SCE-licensed consultant for certain sectors)\
Social Impact Plan (especially for companies with more than 20 employees)\
Corporate Governance Charter\
\
Insider tip:\
Prepare your ESG documents in both English and Arabic—government review is much faster if you upload a bilingual version. Always have your supply chain map ready—don’t wait for last-minute requests.\
Step 3: Registering With Sijilat, MOICT, and SCE\
\
Sijilat portal registration is your digital “home base” (commercial registration guide).\
MOICT handles commercial licenses; new ESG forms are built into the electronic application as of March 2025.\
SCE (Supreme Council for Environment) approval may be needed for environmental permits.\
\
Time-saving advice:\
Early morning (8–10 AM) appointments at MOICT’s Diplomatic Area headquarters are less crowded, and the coffee cart outside is fantastic for networking. Ramadan hours are shorter—plan at least two weeks of buffer time from mid-March to mid-April.\
Step 4: Opening a Sustainable Office\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting.). This can save weeks compared to DIY reporting—and is often required for larger clients or international suppliers.\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Sustainability\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.). Budget BHD 250–400 annually for ESG reporting, including:\
\
BHD 100–200 for basic ESG documentation (policy drafting and templates)\
BHD 100–150 per year for SCE inspections and permits\
BHD 300–600 for “green certified” office leases (premium over basic units)\
\
Moneysaving tip:\
If you join a business incubator in Seef or Bahrain Bay, ESG compliance support is often bundled—saving up to BHD 100 annually.\
Ownership, Sponsorship and Foreign Investor Benefits\
\
Alt text: Professional business support.)\
\
Local sponsorship is not mandatory unless your activity is restricted (details on sponsorship).\
The Sijilat system is designed for fast-track foreigner reviews, especially if you have all ESG and governance documents in order.\
\
\
Importantly, I’ve witnessed Dubai-based clients move regional headquarters to Bahrain solely for this ease and sustainability credibility. UAE and Saudi still require more face-to-face time at ministries, which slows things down.\
\
Compliance, Continuous Improvement, and Common Pitfalls\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.\
Resource recommendation:\
Tamkeen’s online ESG toolkit is a must-start—simple, free guides and updated compliance checklists.\
What Makes Bahrain Stand Out?\
Bahrain’s adaptability and transparency set it apart. Unlike the UAE’s layer-cake of local and federal rules, or Saudi’s frequent policy shifts, Bahrain’s Sijilat and MOICT digital platforms show all needed steps in advance—and the help desks (especially in Diplomatic Area) are genuinely helpful. The local push for sustainability isn’t just for show. Even smaller landlords in Adliya or Juffair are eager to prove their green credentials.\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
Q1: Do all Bahrain companies need to file ESG reports in 2025?\
A:\
No, only public companies and private companies with over BHD 1 million turnover must file formal reports under the BSDR. However, all companies are encouraged to adopt basic ESG policies. New startups can use the Tamkeen ESG toolkit. For guidance, see this specialist page.\
Q2: Can I set up a Bahrain company online as a foreigner?\
A:\
Yes, foreigners are allowed 99–100% ownership in most sectors. The Sijilat online portal is streamlined for direct applications. Find more here on foreign ownership and detailed process guidance.\
Q3: What is the fastest way to get ESG-compliant office space?\
A:\
Lease from office providers in Seef District or Bahrain Bay advertising “green lease” credentials. These offices are SCE pre-certified and reduce inspection requirements. See Free Zone options for further benefits.\
Q4: What are the biggest ESG-related mistakes new founders make?\
A:\
Missing the March 31 ESG filing deadline, failing to digitize documents in Arabic, and not budgeting for annual SCE fees. Avoid these by using professional help and following the Sijilat dashboard closely.\
Q5: How much does ESG compliance add to Bahrain company formation costs?\
A:\
Estimate BHD 250–400 annually above standard formation costs. Full details and breakdowns can be found at this cost guide.\

My bad if you had to read that mess in the middle of the night. I cleaned it up properly now hope this version doesn’t burn your eyes!

Hi again, everyone!

My last post kinda blew up unexpectedly, and the comment section turned into a full on procrastination support group. I read every single reply and saw how similar we all are:
	Some people said they’ve tried every trick in the book  nothing works.
	Some said procrastination is just their permanent setting.
	Some haven’t even taken the first step yet.

I feel you. Because I used to be a professional fake busy guy myself.

The “Pretend Effort” Days

Back in high school and the first three years of college, I lived like a monk.
First to the library. Notes thick as textbooks. Never skipped a class.

But guess what? My grades sucked.

I genuinely couldn’t understand it. I was putting in 120% effort, so why did it all feel so… hollow?

A teacher once looked at me and said, “You’re doing fake work.”

I was offended. But years later? I get it now.

I’d tell myself I was “studying physics,” then spend the whole day watching YouTube videos on how to build a cannon.
I still failed the mechanics exam.


   This is the sneakiest part of Parkinson’s Law:

It doesn’t just mean “work expands to fill the time available.”

It tricks you into confusing inefficient busyness with actual effort.
It gives you this warm, fuzzy feeling of “being productive” when you’re just spinning your wheels.

A 4-hour assignment would stretch into an entire day, and I’d go to bed thinking,

“Damn, I worked so hard today.”

But all I’d done was stay busy  not effective.

That’s when I realized:

The problem wasn’t my tools.
The problem was my rhythm.


🔁 My 7 Day “Dynamic Balance” Challenge

(aka the healing system that saved me from fake effort)

I built this challenge to help me find balance. Not just to “work better,” but to work smarter and live better.
I juggle school and a startup, so I needed a system that lets me push when I need to — and rest without guilt.


😶‍🌫️Day 1 Visualize Your Efficiency

Stop setting goals like “I’ll finish this whole project today.”

It sounds good, but it sets you up for procrastination.

Instead, break everything down into 15-minute atomic units. For example:
Making a video =
	15 min script
	15 min shoot
	15 min edit
	and15 min review

That’s it. Each unit is bite-sized, doable, and trackable.

And the real magic?
You’ll often beat the timer. You’ll do a 15-minute task in 10.
And it feels amazing. Better than any TikTok dopamine hit.

You’ll start chasing that efficiency high.


🤬 Day 2  Procrastination = Emotional Signal

Even my friends at MIT, UCB, LSE they game, scroll, zone out.

Procrastination isn’t always laziness.
Sometimes it’s your brain waving a flag saying, “Hey. I’m tired. Let me switch channels.”

So I created conscious procrastination blocks:
	15 minutes of guilt free chill
	Walks. Music. Dumb memes. Whatever.

If you choose to rest it’s not wasted time. It’s a strategic recharge.


🤨Day 3  Destroy the “Big Monster” Tasks

Some tasks just sound scary:

“Write the weekly report”
“Review the whole chapter”

Too vague. Too big. So I break it down like this:
	Write the first sentence.
	Highlight 3 key terms.
	Summarize one idea in one line.

Make the task so tiny you can’t say no to it.
Start small. That’s the trick.

🥸Day 4  The Environment Contagion Principle

I can’t focus at home. Too many distractions.

So I work at Starbucks every day. That coffee cup?
It’s a physical anchor. The moment I sit down and sip, my brain clicks into “let’s go” mode.

Here’s a nerdy fun fact:
In marketing, this is called object anchoring  using a physical item to trigger a mental state.
(Think “donuts at Disney,” if you’ve seen that case study.)

Also: Everyone around me is working too. That quiet social pressure? It works.

🤓 Day 5  Reward > Punishment

Willpower runs out. Rewards don’t.
	Finish one micro-task → scroll your phone guilt-free
	Finish 3 micro-tasks → grab a latte or walk the mall

Gamify your own life. Make “discipline” feel fun.

 🧐Day 6  Nightly Reviews = No More Phantom Stress

I used to say, “I was sooo busy today,”
But when I looked back, I did… basically nothing.

Now, I write 3 things each night before bed:
	1	What I actually got done
	2	One thing I could do better
	3	One sentence for tomorrow’s focus

That little reflection clears my mind and stops the “midnight guilt spiral.”


😀 Day 7  “Rhythm” Is the Theme of a Long Term Life

One day, I sat in the cafe and… nothing. No focus. No energy.

Old me would panic.
New me? I just went for a walk.

30 minutes later, I was back.

Balance isn’t about being productive 24/7.
It’s about knowing when to go hard and when to let go.

Final Thoughts:

I’m not some productivity guru.
I’m just a guy who got sick of fake hustle and found a system that works.

It’s soft.
It’s real.
It’s mine.

If you’ve ever felt stuck in a loop of “busy but going nowhere,”
You’re not alone. And you’re not broken.

This time she didn't like what my step-dad responded to her so she is ignoring him. 

I didn't get to hear what my step-dad did really say but I got to know through talking to both side and here is what I concluded:
____________________________
*In a restaurant*

Mom: Is the (food name) good here?

Stepdad: (thinks it's a stupid question and instead of saying 'no I haven't eaten here yet.') You ate it before.
Mom: (gets upset)
Stepdad: (sees she's getting mad)  You had this before and I haven't eaten here before so idk.

Mom: But why did you say ""You ate it before? Im asking you a question and this is what you say?"" (A Lil anger in her voice
____________________________
I started noticing their bickering bc mom kept repeat the phrase ""You ate it before"" when step-dad tried to explain and people around us started to notice too. To diffuse the situation, I told them to calm down and just eat the food.

For the rest of the day mom ignored step-dad and when he tries to talk to her again, she would not talk or plainly ignore his words and occasionally reply with ""mmm"".
____________________________
I tried talking to mom that night again about how what we should do tomorrow. All she said was ""Nothing and I'll stay inside until my flight to go back."" I wasn't happy with that so I replied ""Don't be like that we still need to do (activity name). She replies with that same phrase ""No need we already 'did that before.'"" 
____________________________
During the evening my stepdad's father started to also notice bc mom didn't come out of her room for dinner and so grandpa asked to go to a coffee shop, which my mom denied when I went inside the room and asked her. Saying again:""No need I already had coffee before.""

In the end, grandpa stayed at home while me and step-dad went out and had a talk. He was really pissed and vented the way to the coffee shop. Stepdad said he doesn't like what she is doing and that he didn't do anything wrong. He hated how she even denies when grandpa wanted us all to go. Stepdad says that when he got mad before he didn't show he was angry infront of mom's family bc they werent involved, so he expect mom to do the same for grandpa.

He said that mom has been doing this for years and to ease the tension, he gives in by apologizing and told me to do the same thing if my mom gets upset with me.

I guess this time stepdad refused to budget even tho he tried talking to her multiple times.

(I was scared that he'll cut things for good. Holding back my tears)
____________________________
(it's the second day now - morning)

Step-dad tried to be peaceful by saying:

Stepdad: Baby let's go out and have breakfast

Mom: (dead silence)

Stepdad: (repeats what he says multiple times)

Mom:....

Me: (mind: might as well be talking to a wall)

Mom: (finally replies...) Mmmm

Stepdad: (sighs and leaves to buy breakfast like he did last night bc mom refused to eat)

*an hour later* 
Stepdad: (tries the same thing but different activity)

Mom: (silent treatment)

Stepdad: (sighs and leaves)
___________
*me and mom alone when step-dad left once again*

Me: (upset and just grunt irritably)

____________________________


Idk what to do. I guess I'm just venting here bc I find my mom's anger over the top. A few days ago, I caught her doing the same, getting mad at stepdad for saying something. I called her out and said not to be like that bc she stared at him with wide eyes and angry tone. She played it off and there was no silent treatment and everything good.

Is it my mom's silent treatment that made me anxious when someone goes silent and I think they're mad at me? I get disheartened when there is sign of annoyance from someone I care even if it's temporary.

I just finished diving headfirst into Tess Gerritsen's *The Apprentice*, and wow, do I have some thoughts to share! If you're looking for a book that will grab you from the first page and not let go, you might want to check out [The Apprentice By Tess Gerritsen](https://pdfhive.com/the-apprentice-by-tess-gerritsen/). It's a real rollercoaster of a read.

**What's it all about? (No Spoilers, Promise!)**

So, *The Apprentice* is the second book in the Rizzoli & Isles series, and it picks up not long after the chilling events of the first one. Detective Jane Rizzoli finds herself facing a new, terrifying serial killer who seems to be mimicking the gruesome methods of a previous one – someone she thought was safely behind bars. This new killer, however, has a fresh and even more disturbing twist. Jane has to team up with the newly introduced medical examiner, Dr. Maura Isles, and together they try to unravel a twisted puzzle before more lives are lost. It’s a very intense and intricate chase against time, and Gerritsen masterfully weaves together suspense and police procedural details.

**What I Really Liked:**

First off, Gerritsen's writing style is just fantastic for this genre. She's incredibly skilled at building tension. Every chapter leaves you wanting to know what happens next, and I found myself staying up way past my bedtime, just needing to read ""one more page."" The pacing is absolutely brilliant; it starts strong and just keeps accelerating.

I also really enjoyed the character development, especially for Jane Rizzoli. She's tough, determined, but also very human and vulnerable, especially after her past experiences. Seeing her navigate the psychological toll of these horrific cases feels very real. Dr. Maura Isles, making her debut here, is a fascinating addition – her calm, analytical approach often contrasts nicely with Jane's more impulsive nature, creating a compelling dynamic. The villain, without giving anything away, is truly unsettling and memorable, providing a great challenge for our heroes. Gerritsen's medical details are also super precise and add a layer of realism that makes everything feel incredibly authentic. If you appreciate the nitty-gritty of forensic work, you'll love it.

**Any Small Niggles?**

Honestly, it’s hard to find major faults. If I had to pick something, I’d say that sometimes the descriptions of the crime scenes can be quite graphic. For readers who are sensitive to that kind of detail, it might be a bit much. It's a thriller, so you expect some intensity, but just a heads-up if you prefer your mysteries a little less visceral. But for me, it just added to the realism and the sheer thrill of it all.

**Would I Recommend It? And To Whom?**

Absolutely, yes! I wholeheartedly recommend *The Apprentice*. If you love gripping thrillers, police procedurals, or psychological suspense, this book is definitely for you. It's perfect for anyone who enjoys authors like Patricia Cornwell or Karin Slaughter. It's not a cozy mystery, so if you're looking for something light, this isn't it. But if you're ready for a dark, thrilling ride that will keep you guessing until the very end, grab a copy of [The Apprentice By Tess Gerritsen](https://pdfhive.com/the-apprentice-by-tess-gerritsen/).

If you're new to reading, or just looking to get back into it, navigating the vast world of books can feel a bit daunting. But trust me, it's a wonderful journey!

1.  **Start with What You Love (or Think You'd Love):** Don't feel pressured to read ""classics"" if they don't appeal to you. If you like thrillers from TV shows, try a thriller! If fantasy games are your thing, dive into a fantasy novel. For books like *The Apprentice*, if you enjoy true crime podcasts or intense TV dramas, you'll likely enjoy this genre.
2.  **It's Okay to Put a Book Down:** Seriously! If you're 50 pages in and it's just not clicking, don't force it. There are millions of books out there. Life's too short to read something you're not enjoying.
3.  **Short & Sweet is Fine:** You don't have to start with an epic 800-page fantasy novel. A shorter novel, or even a collection of short stories, can be a great way to build your reading momentum.
4.  **Find Your Reading Nook:** Whether it's a comfy armchair, a coffee shop, or even just your bed, having a designated, cozy spot can make reading feel more like a treat.
5.  **Audiobooks Count!** If sitting down with a physical book is tough, try audiobooks. They're fantastic for commutes, chores, or just relaxing. You're still engaging with the story and author's words!
6.  **Join the Conversation:** Places like Reddit are amazing for finding book recommendations, discussing what you've read, and connecting with other readers. It’s incredibly motivating to share your thoughts and hear others’ perspectives.

**Motivational Moment:** Don't stress about reading a certain number of books or keeping up with trends. Reading is about exploring new worlds, understanding different perspectives, and simply enjoying a good story. It's a personal journey, and there's no right or wrong way to do it. Just pick up a book, open it up, and let the adventure begin!

1mxw3jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalFistula/comments/1mxw3jx/seton_inserted_8_days_ago/,Seton inserted 8 days ago,"Hi everyone 
I’m from the UK so my post is mainly NHS based but all advice and tips would be appreciated as I’ve found a lot of helpful info from America so far. 
I am particularly keen to hear from people in the uk who may have had similar experiences to me after having the op done by the nhs. Apologies in advance this is probably going to be a long ass read as a lot has happened and I have a tendency to be a yapper. 

I had a perianal abscess I&D 18/07 under GA and was told no fistula found and the drainage was “underwhelming” (surgeons words) not a lot of pus came out. I was sent home a few hours later. Initially things were ok, obviously very sore and had a leaking wound to manage. 
I’m a nurse myself by background and over the course of the next week I saw my wound seemingly break down, gushing brown sludge +++ constantly needing to change my dressings and it stank tbh and I’m used to bad smells in my line of work. The whole area was extremely inflamed and I needed to be peeled off the ceiling every time I had a new dressing put on, the pain was horrendous. I had a swab taken by my GP which came back negative no infection but I had a course of abx whilst waiting for that result anyway, as it seemed so infected at the time. 
The abx obviously didn’t improve things fully as there was no infection, so I got referred back to my local hospital by my gp on the 29th July (tues). Saw surgical team on weds, Had an MRI next day then got the result back the day after that (Friday)
Going by a lot of posts I’ve seen on here that’s really quick and I am grateful for that part of the service I’ve received and can’t fault it. 
The MRI confirmed I have a “intersphincteric fistula” and I’d need another operation. 
For some bizarre reason after the MRI all the leaking completely seized and I was feeling a lot better in myself. So when I was reviewed on the Monday, the surgeon was pleased and said basically they didn’t need to rush me to theatre and they’d review in 2 weeks and see how things were then. 
This was a lot to process as I’d fully prepped myself to go (I am neurodivergent, so I process things differently and slower than maybe other people do) so I felt conflicted and kinda annoyed I’d gone through so much with this wound and was finally getting somewhere and it just stopped acting up suddenly. Albeit I had just had to cancel my holiday and not go to a family wedding because of it all, so I think that played a lot into my frustration. But I’d also not been taking my adhd meds for a while so my emotions were really dysregulated. 
They said any hint of leaking or pain and to go straight back to them. 3 days later I started getting severe shooting pain and some leakage. So I went back- eventually saw a colorectal surgeon who planned for theatre. I was given 27th August initially which at the time was about 3-4 weeks. 
Start of last week I got a call from the hospital saying they’d had a cancellation and if I’d like to have the op earlier. I obviously said yes immediately. I wanted this all over and done with. (Famous last words) 
The wound from my I&D had near enough healed up by the time of my op. It was about 7’oclock from my anus so it was a fucker of a job to get healed due to high risk of infection and how much of a pain it was to have BM. But I’d managed it with the help of my mum who is a retired community nurse. (Thank god I had her because otherwise I’d have been fucked and probably ended up with sepsis)
The surgeon explained what she was going to do re the seton and what else she might have to do if she finds anything else. 
I don’t know why but I thought she’d be putting the seton through that wound and it would be reopened. ?? But the seton is coming out of my anus which I wasn’t expecting. 
The op went fine, I was pretty high on the drugs in recovery when the surgeon came to see me and said she’d found some “thickness” and she wanted to review me in 6 weeks. I asked what that meant but for the life of me can’t remember what she said as I was still pretty out of it. 
The nurses couldn’t tell me. I went back to the day unit where I was just on a mission to go home, so got a sandwich down me, had a wee and got dressed ready to go. 
The post op advice was “don’t get constipated” & essentially good luck and adios. Go back to your gp with any concerns. 
I’d still had some codeine leftover at home from my last op so they didn’t give me any pain relief to go home with. 
I had to take the codeine initially as the pain was a joke, couldn’t sneeze or cough or really move a muscle without having pain. I was taking a cocktail of laxatives the first few days alongside the codeine. The laxatives weren’t really working to be honest, I was maybe having 1 BM a day or less which in hindsight wasn’t great but at the time gave everything a bit of break down there and was less painful. I’ve never experienced laxatives not working for me so it was quite puzzling. 

I’d ordered some microlax enemas from Amazon one morning because i faced the facts- I was constipated and potentially impacted as it had been 2 days. Before the microlax arrived I had to have a BM which turned into the worst BM of my life. 
The pain was like nothing else, going off the good old Bristol stool chart I think I had a new type called type 0. My neighbours must’ve thought I was in labour or something I was screaming throughout. I deffo think I tore something. I was mentally and physically traumatised after that but it needed to happen and I needed that BM to get things moving again. However I’ve been in horrific pain ever since, struggling to walk, sit, bend to pick anything up etc. Pain relief is only taking the edge off I’m in constant pain now. 
I started hitting the prune juice after that following seeing some advice on here or online (from American healthcare providers and hospital websites).. and the enemas arrived after the horrific ordeal was over! Better late than never. 
Turns out with the prune juice the enemas aren’t necessary cos wow that stuff works. I’m now at the other extreme where I can’t really keep anything in me and my bowel is churning and gurgling like crazy every time I eat or drink. I’m eating minimal amounts, mainly soup, houmous, made a nice shepherds pie with butter beans and chickpeas in, with a boat load of veg (would recommend)
I read on an American site to avoid tea coffee and fizzy drinks. The coffee and fizzy drinks I get but tea?? Is it because of the caffeine because I only drink decaf due to my adhd. I’m too English I need my tea.. 
I’m trying absolutely everything to manage this but I honestly think after that BM I’ve damaged my insides, maybe caused a fissure?? I’ve had them in the past so it does feel similar. 

The pain is still horrendous and this BM was 3 days ago now. Even tho I’m loose it’s still extremely painful, burning and stinging. I’ve started using germoloids cream that’s for piles to numb the area and inside. But I’m sure that BM has damaged either my skin or worse the seton?? 
Am I even meant to use this cream or will it go into the fistula and cause more issues ? 

I was given absolutely minimal post op advice to be honest, what not to do etc. I’m not a surgical nurse I have no clue about this, don’t know if they just assumed because I’m a nurse I should know. I’ve been off work for 5 weeks now and very much feel like a patient all the time now. 

I don’t know what other people’s experiences are of the post op advice from the NHS but that’s what I’ve found the most challenging and frustrating during this experience - the nursing care has been abysmal and I’m not very proud to be an NHS nurse atm. 
I’m not taking the codeine anymore and trying to manage on just paracetamol and ibuprofen with warm sitz baths up to 3x day. British Gas will be rubbing their hands together with the amount of hot water I’m going through. 

Is there anything else I can do to ease this pain?? Writing this whilst sat in a sitz bath, which isn’t giving me the same relief my last one did last night before bed. I’m not sleeping well due to pain, taking sleeping tablets but the pain is breaking through them. 

I wasn’t told how the seton works, like I can feel a lump near where my old wound is, I’m not sure if it’s normal ?? I’ve read about digitation to prevent pockets forming… wasn’t told about that at all? I’ve read all sorts, the most info and advice is on American hospital sites, all the NHS ones I’ve found have been so contradictory. 

I also feel like they gaslight a bit and minimise how intrusive and painful this whole operation and experience is for people. 
I rang the day unit back last night to just say should I still be in this amount of pain a week later, everything is about ass covering (no pun intended) these days she said to attend the hospital just in case somethings wrong. She said I should have some “discomfort” still. I’m sick of that word. Call it what it is, it’s pain. I could’ve rocked up at the hospital but that goes against all I believe in (I’m an A&E nurse) I wasn’t willing to sit on a hard chair for 8 hours to be told the surgical SHOs not sure and I need to wait to see a colorectal specialist on Monday. Honestly there is no point. So I didn’t go and just carried on with my own management at home. 
I’m probably going to contact them Monday if things are still the same, as I think everyone who has this done should be reviewed at least 2 weeks post op, if anything just to check things are ok. ESPECIALLY because we aren’t given a lot of info about it so how are we to know when something is wrong??! I’d rather just be told the brutal facts at the time so at least I can pick up on stuff but I just feel left in the dark with no light at the end of the tunnel. I have daily cries to either my bf or my mum and I just can’t see this being the end for me and things aren’t going to get better any time soon. It’s been so enlightening for me to be on the other side and be a patient for once and I am really struggling mentally with everything and I don’t feel like anyone really understands how painful and debilitating it feels. 
As I said any advice/tips or just some understanding is very appreciated right now. ♥️sorry again for the ramble.

She’s now making a living from social media, as an author and as a Narcissist Survivor Coach 

I see so many women publicly outing their husbands as narcissists even while there’s young children in the picture. 

A cursory glance at these women’s instagram pages illustrates a level of narcissistic behaviour as they parade their children while flaunting the latest fashions from whatever sun drenched location they happen to be in. It’s a case of living your best life away from your Narcissistic ex whose reputation you’ve annihilated. 

Is he really a narcissist, there’s a good chance not. Is she a narcissist, well considering her use of publicity and social media which will no doubt alienate her children against their father there’s a good chance she is. 

This is where having a victim mentality combined with a populist stance with allegations of Narcissism against your ex husband leads to fame and money. 

Where’s her ex husband now with all these accusations and finger pointing going on? Life can’t be good for him.

1mxvy2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mxvy2z/josie_you_know_you_screwed_up_right_vincent/,"""Josie, you know you screwed up, right?"" Vincent Oldham's voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog","Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar.

'Wait, didn't I die?' she thought.

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she'd hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to escape the depression.

'So why am I staring at Vincent, my old college buddy?' Josie blinked hard, her eyes burning. 'Am I tripping again?

'Imagining my crew's here to spring me from jail?'

""Look, we get it—you're gunning to join Professor David Lawson's research team. But that's no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,"" Vincent said, his tone sharp.

""You realize what you've done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she's so messed up she hasn't shown her face at school in days.

""Keep this up, Josie, and you're gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold-blooded?""

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn't respond.

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it.

This wasn't a dream. She was really here, face-to-face with Vincent—ten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She'd somehow jumped back a decade.

Right now, she was still a senior at Aloville Medical School, fresh off nailing the written exam for Professor David Lawson's elite research team.

She'd crushed it, landing a spot in the final round.

But then came the sucker punch: Natalie Kinberg's thesis was a near clone of hers—same angle, same methods, same vibe. No way that was a coincidence.

While Josie was digging for answers, rumors about Natalie plagiarizing spread like wildfire.

David's project was a big deal—first of its kind in the country, with a team of rockstar researchers, including five of Josie's seniors.

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family.

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late-night study sessions, the laughs—they all went to her.

Even David, who used to praise Josie's grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil.

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with anger.

Josie wasn't Natalie's biggest fan, no lie. She'd been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight.

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing.

""You really blew it,"" Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. ""Professor Lawson's giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie in front of the whole school, and he'll let it go.

""He'll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.""

""But if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you're done. Expulsion's on the table.""

""Fine. I'll apologize,"" Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his.

Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who'd fought his way into this school.

She'd known him longest—four years. She thought he'd have her back, trust her when she said she didn't start this drama.

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow.

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn't cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn't push.

""Alright, it's a deal,"" he said. ""I'll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You're reading it to the whole school tomorrow.""

Josie's lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk.

She wasn't that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie.

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her.

But that wasn't the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace.

In her old life, she'd refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie.

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation.

Not this time. She wasn't taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn't be her.

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology.

She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut.

As she crossed campus, the whispers and side-eyes trailed her like a bad smell.

""There she is—Professor Lawson's former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department's darling for supposedly jacking her paper.""

""She thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our five campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in—just as smart, drop-dead gorgeous, and actually nice.""

""Look at that sour face. She's not even in Natalie's league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me.""

""Have her back? Please. They're all Team Natalie now. This whole 'say sorry in front of everyone' thing? Aiden's call.""

'Aiden's idea, huh?' Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip.

She'd barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up.

Jaden was a first-year grad student who'd saved her bacon back in her senior year. She'd been floundering in her toughest classes, and he'd tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams.

When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all-nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She'd never owed him or any of the guys a thing.

Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. ""Josie, I always thought you were one of the good ones.

""Never figured you'd pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She's too kind to even hold it against you.

""You didn't see her after what you did. She's a mess—skinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left.""

""And still, she's got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down-low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you gotta have a heart, yeah?""

""So when you see her, you better say sorry—and mean it, okay?""

Josie dropped her gaze, lashes hiding the fire in her eyes. ""Got it, Jaden. I'll make things right with her, I swear.""

""Should've thought twice before pulling that stunt."" Jaden almost kept going, but seeing her stand there, head down like a kid who got caught, made him ease up.

Deep down, he'd always seen Josie as a solid kid—smart, hardworking, always chasing her academic dreams. Everyone respected her grind.

'So how the hell did she think screwing someone over for a spot was okay?' Jaden wondered, shaking his head. 'What a letdown.'

With a heavy sigh, Jaden led her toward Professor Lawson's office.

The air in David's office was thick with tension as the whole team sat crammed inside.

When Josie walked in, the vibe turned frosty, faces souring like they'd bitten into a lemon.

Except for Natalie. She jumped up, flashing a grin bright enough to blind. ""Josie! You showed!""

""I'm here to say sorry,"" Josie said, sidestepping Natalie's grabby hands.

She didn't have Natalie's gift for playing nice with people she couldn't stand.

Natalie faltered, like she'd been caught off guard. ""Wait, you still think I'm shady, don't you?""

Her voice quivered, eyes glistening like she was about to bawl. ""I didn't copy your paper, Josie. Take it to the dean if you don't believe me. Let them figure it out.""

Josie dropped her gaze, looking more pathetic than Natalie's theatrics. ""I'm apologizing, okay? The papers looking so similar threw me, but I wasn't gonna snitch.

""I didn't breathe a word to anyone else.""

The team, who'd been glaring at Josie like she'd kicked a puppy, started to rethink things.

Josie wasn't a gossip—she barely had friends outside the lab. This drama? She'd only mentioned it to them.

Aiden's frown eased, his eyes settling on Josie. ""I buy that you didn't mean to stir the pot, but Natalie got burned.

""If you hadn't gone all detective, people wouldn't be whispering about her stealing your work.""

""An apology's not too much to ask,"" he added, arms crossed.

Aiden was the team's golden boy—brains, looks, the whole package.

Josie had picked this major partly because it was the med school's hot ticket, but let's be real: Aiden was a big reason too.

He'd been her hero once. Once. Not anymore.

""Fair point,"" Kyle Langton, another senior, chimed in. ""Josie, I'm with Aiden. You didn't mean to cause a mess.

""Natalie's a softie, so just smooth it over, and we're all cool.""

Josie nearly laughed. Natalie, a softie? Yeah, right. But she zipped it. ""Got it, Kyle. I'll fix this.""

Turning to Natalie, she said, ""I'm sorry, Natalie. I messed up, and it hurt you. Honest—can we move past this?""

Then it hit her. Josie had been tight with this crew for years before Natalie rolled in. Breaking that bond? Tougher than she thought.

Natalie flashed a sugary smile. ""Josie, I was never mad! Forgive? Psh, nothing to forgive!""

She spun to David, plopping down beside him with a flirty grin, voice all sweet. ""Told ya, Professor Lawson. Josie wouldn't try to screw me over. Cut her some slack, yeah?""

Lawson wasn't biting. His face was hard as granite, shooting Josie a look that could freeze lava. ""On purpose or not, she screwed up. And screw-ups have consequences. So, Josie, how should I deal with you?""

David's face was like stone as he shot Josie a hard stare.

He'd always thought she was the good girl—smart, driven, a total overachiever. Now? He wasn't so sure.

To him, grades were one thing, but a shady character was a dealbreaker. 'She's gotta learn her lesson,' he decided. 'No more badmouthing her classmates.'

Josie had puzzled over why everyone bought Natalie's act. After some soul-searching, it clicked: Natalie was gorgeous and a master at playing the damsel.

Josie couldn't compete. So she swallowed her pride. ""Whatever you say, Professor Lawson.""

""We're kicking off research soon,"" David said, voice sharp. ""Your punishment? Sort every scrap of data. Make it so we can grab what we need, no fuss, no muss.""

He waved them off.

As they headed out, Josie, stuck in the middle, flashed back to her old life.

She'd been slapped with a disciplinary note and kicked off the team. To make things right, she'd buried herself in the archives, sorting documents like a machine.

It took a brutal month—one meal a day, late nights, the works. She ended up with a messed-up stomach and flunked classes.

And the thanks? Nada. They just griped her work wasn't good enough.

'What a load of crap,' she thought. 'Bust your tail, and they still dump on you.'

Now, here she was again, stuck with the same lousy job.

""Hey, Josie, I'll help you out,"" Natalie said, catching up and linking arms with her. ""If I keep my mouth shut, the prof won't know.""

""She's got this coming,"" Jaden cut in, pulling Natalie back. ""Why cover for her?""

Vincent glanced at Natalie. ""Chill about Professor Lawson. Sorting files is nothing compared to a real punishment.""

""Got it, thanks, Vince,"" Josie said with a quick smile, hurrying after Natalie.

""Hey, Nat, I was so caught up saying sorry earlier, I forgot—I got you a little something."" She pulled a sleek box from her bag.

The group stopped cold, crowding around.

""That Aiden's medal?"" Tianna blurted.

Vincent nodded. ""Yeah, his first big win in that med competition. He loved that thing—till he gave it to you to cheer you up.""

""Spot on,"" Josie said, eyeing the group. ""I was new, totally bombed an experiment, and Professor Lawson chewed me out. Aiden gave me this medal, said it was lucky.

""And you know what? After that, I was golden—no more screw-ups.""

She held the box out to Natalie. ""Natalie, I heard this mess really got you down—depression and all. Take this. It's like a good-luck charm.

""You'll be set from now on. Aiden swore by it.""

Natalie's eyes lit up. She wanted that medal. Not just for its shine, but because it was Aiden's—his first victory, something special.

In her eyes, Josie didn't deserve it. But snagging it right in front of him? That was ballsy.

""Josie, that's sweet, but it's Aiden's gift to you,"" Natalie said, pushing the box back. ""I can't take it.""

# 3.Chapter 3 Picking A New Major

Josie shot Aiden a quick glance before shoving the medal into Natalie's hands. ""Heard it was Aiden's big idea to make you apologize in front of everyone.

""He's clearly got a soft spot for you. It's just a medal—he won't care if it cheers you up.""

""Right, Aiden?"" Josie shot him a sly grin.

That grin stung like a jab. Aiden knew she was salty about the whole apology deal.

'She's the one who screwed up!' he thought, steaming. 'How's she gonna be so petty?'

That medal wasn't just some cheap token—it was his first, handed over with so much pride. Back then, he'd been over the moon to give it to her. Now? Total regret.

'She doesn't get it,' he fumed. 'I treated her like my little sis, always had her back, helped her out.

'And what do I get? All that care, tossed in the trash.'

""Nice one, Josie,"" Aiden growled, snatching the medal back.

Josie didn't flinch. She raised an eyebrow. ""What, not cool with cheering up your little star? Thought you'd love it.""

""You don't just regift something someone gave you,"" Natalie snapped, pouting. ""Come on, Josie, that's basic.""

""But you're not just anyone,"" Josie said, all innocent with a blink. ""You're the team's darling. Aiden's fine with it, right?""

""Over the moon,"" Aiden said, his calm mask cracking with a scowl. He shoved the medal at Natalie. ""Here, kid. Keep it safe. Don't be like some people who flunk Gift 101.""

He stormed off.

The second he was gone, Natalie's face darkened. She'd always wanted that medal, but like this? It felt wrong.

Josie was bolder than she thought, humiliating Aiden in front of everyone. 'Is she trying to get booted from the team?' she wondered.

""Josie, what's your deal?"" Vincent groaned, glaring. ""Why tick off Aiden? You still wanna do research or not?""

Josie sighed. ""I thought he'd be stoked since he's so into Natalie. How was I supposed to know he'd flip?""

""Josie, you know you screwed up, right?"" Vincent Oldham's voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog.

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar.

'Wait, didn't I die?' she thought.

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she'd hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to escape the depression.

'So why am I staring at Vincent, my old college buddy?' Josie blinked hard, her eyes burning. 'Am I tripping again?

'Imagining my crew's here to spring me from jail?'

""Look, we get it—you're gunning to join Professor David Lawson's research team. But that's no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,"" Vincent said, his tone sharp.

""You realize what you've done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she's so messed up she hasn't shown her face at school in days.

""Keep this up, Josie, and you're gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold-blooded?""

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn't respond.

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it.

This wasn't a dream. She was really here, face-to-face with Vincent—ten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She'd somehow jumped back a decade.

Right now, she was still a senior at Aloville Medical School, fresh off nailing the written exam for Professor David Lawson's elite research team.

She'd crushed it, landing a spot in the final round.

But then came the sucker punch: Natalie Kinberg's thesis was a near clone of hers—same angle, same methods, same vibe. No way that was a coincidence.

While Josie was digging for answers, rumors about Natalie plagiarizing spread like wildfire.

David's project was a big deal—first of its kind in the country, with a team of rockstar researchers, including five of Josie's seniors.

1mxvwqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1mxvwqa/if_you_are_crazy_enough_to_make_this_i_would_like/,"If you are crazy enough to make this, I would like to work for you.","Warframes are highly advanced, bio-mechanical suits of armor used by the Tenno during the Old War. This means we can do some pretty crazy things with skin designs. I can say that all skin designs so far have been bio-mechanical.



What I suggest doing here is removing the bio component of skin designs and adding a new series of skin designs to the game. A short story and mission could be added to the game to suit this. This would also add a new power limit for farming. The correct term could be described as the use of more user-friendly in-game items.



Their story is simply that they are old experimental technologies that allow Warframes to be customized with technological parts in specific areas to make them more effective in combat. Because only the technology is used, these upgrades will not have a bio component, but will have a mechanical component. This will allow the armor to resemble the kind of Iron Man armor Warframes wear.



These armors won't be old-tech combat vehicles like Neco mechs; they'll be experimental technology developed for use in special operations in existing Warframes.



My particular recommendation is that these armors have a design reminiscent of robotics and modern technology. We're eliminating the bios. These armors will primarily allow some of the existing settings we use in the game to become abilities we can use instantly while playing the game.



Passive Ability: This will allow Faction Damage Mods to be automatically applied based on the enemy we're fighting. This means that when this armor is equipped, if you have Faction Damage Mods, and the weapon you're using has one of these mods, the corresponding mod will be automatically applied.



1- A setting that allows enemy and friendly units to be highlighted will be added to the game as a fifth power with this armor. This means we can make enemies more visible or return to our normal view with a single keystroke. We spend a considerable amount of time utilizing this setting, and its use will be more effective.



2- Squad Energy Restore, which we use in the game, will be added to the game as the sixth power with this armor, and its use will, of course, be limited, just like the old Squad Energy Restore. You'll need to craft it to refill it as before. The difference is that it will be more practical to use, as it spreads from the armor while you're moving.



3- Squad Ammo Restore will be added as the seventh power when using armor. While its usage will be completely the same, I recommend a graphical and animation design that matches the armor. All the limitations of the old version will remain, and of course, you'll need to craft it to use it.



4-We've used many mods to improve the minimap radar in the game. This ability will be added as an eighth power, giving it the same effect as mods we can use on the minimap. In other words, it will allow us to see hidden items in a specific area and enemies from a certain distance more effectively. By limiting its use and allowing it to be added to existing mods, it will become a highly useful power and a useful ability, even if it doesn't change the overall structure of the game.



5- One of the biggest problems I've encountered in the game is the use of the map. I think these armors will be quite effective in improving this. This will be added as the ninth skill, and when used, a computer screen will appear. The map will be more detailed and feature an interface that will allow us to place various markers on it. For example, it will allow us to plan our gameplay on the map with specific symbols and markers, such as defense, attack, hold this line, player number one should go here, or ""there's a valuable item here.""



6- Our final skill will be quite different. We could call it the ultimate. It will be something all players will want to own. If you're ready, put your coffee down and read the rest of the article when you're sure you're not left with any. I don't want you to vomit coffee on your computer. Don't say I didn't warn you, but let me add a short note: I accept no responsibility for any negative consequences that may arise from reading this by players with heart conditions.



When this ability is used, the armor will interact with another player with the same armor, and if the other player accepts, both armors will merge into a single warframe.(biger one) The first player to use the ability is responsible for the warframe's direction and movement, while the other player is responsible for using weapons and abilities. A new weapons will be used for the armor: a minigun mounted on the armor's shoulder (specifically a multi-barreled gun with rotational animation) and a missile launcher. The abilities will be the second player's abilities. The missiles from the weapons will automatically target the target. The minigun will have unlimited ammunition. Total shield and armor value will be the combined value of both players.Usage will be limited to 3 minutes per mission.

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family. Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late-night study sessions, the laughs—they all went to her. Even David, who used to praise Josie's grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil. When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with anger. Josie wasn't Natalie's biggest fan, no lie. She'd been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight. But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing. ""You really blew it,"" Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. ""Professor Lawson's giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie in front of the whole school, and he'll let it go. ""He'll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment."" ""But if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you're done. Expulsion's on the table."" ""Fine. I'll apologize,"" Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his. Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who'd fought his way into this school. She'd known him longest—four years. She thought he'd have her back, trust her when she said she didn't start this drama. Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow. Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn't cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn't push. ""Alright, it's a deal,"" he said. ""I'll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You're reading it to the whole school tomorrow."" Josie's lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk. She wasn't that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie. Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her. But that wasn't the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace. In her old life, she'd refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie. Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation. Not this time. She wasn't taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn't be her. The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology. She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut. As she crossed campus, the whispers and side-eyes trailed her like a bad smell. ""There she is—Professor Lawson's former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department's darling for supposedly jacking her paper."" ""She thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our five campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in—just as smart, drop-dead gorgeous, and actually nice."" ""Look at that sour face. She's not even in Natalie's league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me."" ""Have her back? Please. They're all Team Natalie now. This whole 'say sorry in front of everyone' thing? Aiden's call."" 'Aiden's idea, huh?' Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip. She'd barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up. Jaden was a first-year grad student who'd saved her bacon back in her senior year. She'd been floundering in her toughest classes, and he'd tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams. When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all-nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She'd never owed him or any of the guys a thing. Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. ""Josie, I always thought you were one of the good ones. ""Never figured you'd pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She's too kind to even hold it against you. ""You didn't see her after what you did. She's a mess—skinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left."" ""And still, she's got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down-low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you gotta have a heart, yeah?"" ""So when you see her, you better say sorry—and mean it, okay?"" Josie dropped her gaze, lashes hiding the fire in her eyes. ""Got it, Jaden. I'll make things right with her, I swear."" ""Should've thought twice before pulling that stunt."" Jaden almost kept going, but seeing her stand there, head down like a kid who got caught, made him ease up. Deep down, he'd always seen Josie as a solid kid—smart, hardworking, always chasing her academic dreams. Everyone respected her grind. 'So how the hell did she think screwing someone over for a spot was okay?' Jaden wondered, shaking his head. 'What a letdown.' With a heavy sigh, Jaden led her toward Professor Lawson's office. 2.Chapter 2 Saying Sorry The air in David's office was thick with tension as the whole team sat crammed inside.

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late-night study sessions, the laughs—they all went to her.

Even David, who used to praise Josie's grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil.

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with anger.

Josie wasn't Natalie's biggest fan, no lie. She'd been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight.

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing.

""You really blew it,"" Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. ""Professor Lawson's giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie in front of the whole school, and he'll let it go.

""He'll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.""

""But if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you're done. Expulsion's on the table.""

""Fine. I'll apologize,"" Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his.

Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who'd fought his way into this school.

She'd known him longest—four years. She thought he'd have her back, trust her when she said she didn't start this drama.

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow.

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn't cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn't push.

""Alright, it's a deal,"" he said. ""I'll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You're reading it to the whole school tomorrow.""

Josie's lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk.

She wasn't that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie.

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her.

But that wasn't the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace.

In her old life, she'd refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie.

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation.

Not this time. She wasn't taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn't be her.

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology.

She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut.

As she crossed campus, the whispers and side-eyes trailed her like a bad smell.

""There she is—Professor Lawson's former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department's darling for supposedly jacking her paper.""

""She thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our five campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in—just as smart, drop-dead gorgeous, and actually nice.""

""Look at that sour face. She's not even in Natalie's league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me.""

""Have her back? Please. They're all Team Natalie now. This whole 'say sorry in front of everyone' thing? Aiden's call.""

'Aiden's idea, huh?' Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip.

She'd barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up.

Jaden was a first-year grad student who'd saved her bacon back in her senior year. She'd been floundering in her toughest classes, and he'd tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams.

When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all-nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She'd never owed him or any of the guys a thing.

Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. ""Josie, I always thought you were one of the good ones.

""Never figured you'd pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She's too kind to even hold it against you.

""You didn't see her after what you did. She's a mess—skinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left.""

""And still, she's got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down-low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you gotta have a heart, yeah?""

""So when you see her, you better say sorry—and mean it, okay?""

Josie dropped her gaze, lashes hiding the fire in her eyes. ""Got it, Jaden. I'll make things right with her, I swear.""

""Should've thought twice before pulling that stunt."" Jaden almost kept going, but seeing her stand there, head down like a kid who got caught, made him ease up.

Deep down, he'd always seen Josie as a solid kid—smart, hardworking, always chasing her academic dreams. Everyone respected her grind.

'So how the hell did she think screwing someone over for a spot was okay?' Jaden wondered, shaking his head. 'What a letdown.'

With a heavy sigh, Jaden led her toward Professor Lawson's office.

# 2.Chapter 2 Saying Sorry

The air in David's office was thick with tension as the whole team sat crammed inside.

When Josie walked in, the vibe turned frosty, faces souring like they'd bitten into a lemon.

Except for Natalie. She jumped up, flashing a grin bright enough to blind. ""Josie! You showed!""

""I'm here to say sorry,"" Josie said, sidestepping Natalie's grabby hands.

She didn't have Natalie's gift for playing nice with people she couldn't stand.

Natalie faltered, like she'd been caught off guard. ""Wait, you still think I'm shady, don't you?""

Her voice quivered, eyes glistening like she was about to bawl. ""I didn't copy your paper, Josie. Take it to the dean if you don't believe me. Let them figure it out.""

Josie dropped her gaze, looking more pathetic than Natalie's theatrics. ""I'm apologizing, okay? The papers looking so similar threw me, but I wasn't gonna snitch.

""I didn't breathe a word to anyone else.""

The team, who'd been glaring at Josie like she'd kicked a puppy, started to rethink things.

Josie wasn't a gossip—she barely had friends outside the lab. This drama? She'd only mentioned it to them.

Aiden's frown eased, his eyes settling on Josie. ""I buy that you didn't mean to stir the pot, but Natalie got burned.

""If you hadn't gone all detective, people wouldn't be whispering about her stealing your work.""

""An apology's not too much to ask,"" he added, arms crossed.

Aiden was the team's golden boy—brains, looks, the whole package.

Josie had picked this major partly because it was the med school's hot ticket, but let's be real: Aiden was a big reason too.

He'd been her hero once. Once. Not anymore.

""Fair point,"" Kyle Langton, another senior, chimed in. ""Josie, I'm with Aiden. You didn't mean to cause a mess.

""Natalie's a softie, so just smooth it over, and we're all cool.""

Josie nearly laughed. Natalie, a softie? Yeah, right. But she zipped it. ""Got it, Kyle. I'll fix this.""

Turning to Natalie, she said, ""I'm sorry, Natalie. I messed up, and it hurt you. Honest—can we move past this?""

Then it hit her. Josie had been tight with this crew for years before Natalie rolled in. Breaking that bond? Tougher than she thought.

Natalie flashed a sugary smile. ""Josie, I was never mad! Forgive? Psh, nothing to forgive!""

She spun to David, plopping down beside him with a flirty grin, voice all sweet. ""Told ya, Professor Lawson. Josie wouldn't try to screw me over. Cut her some slack, yeah?""

Lawson wasn't biting. His face was hard as granite, shooting Josie a look that could freeze lava. ""On purpose or not, she screwed up. And screw-ups have consequences. So, Josie, how should I deal with you?""

David's face was like stone as he shot Josie a hard stare.

He'd always thought she was the good girl—smart, driven, a total overachiever. Now? He wasn't so sure.

To him, grades were one thing, but a shady character was a dealbreaker. 'She's gotta learn her lesson,' he decided. 'No more badmouthing her classmates.'

Josie had puzzled over why everyone bought Natalie's act. After some soul-searching, it clicked: Natalie was gorgeous and a master at playing the damsel.",1,1755937287.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1mxvty9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Toowoomba/comments/1mxvty9/moving_to_toowoomba/,Moving to Toowoomba,"Hi Lovely Folks, 

In the last 30 minutes I have found out that an idea being thrown around of moving from Townsville to Toowoomba is a very real possibility by the end of the year. We are a grown up couple with a cat and an aquarium and looking for a minimum 3 bed home (preferably either 4 with no pool or 3 with pool), close to at least a supermarket, coffee shop or two and a local pub that is not reliant on a courtesy bus but something we can either walk to, or a taxi/uber under $15. 

Our budget is around the $700/week mark to rent but as you can imagine coming from Townsville, safety/low crime areas are a must (we are currently in one of the “better” suburbs of Townsville and had 4 x home invasion attempts, one successful in the first 12 months). I work from home and my partner travels a bit for work so I don’t want to have to be alarming every door, blocking entry points with washing machines and such, just to sleep safe when he is away. We have not even visited Toowoomba yet (this is very new news) and plan to before the potential move, but I would love some insider advice on where to consider/where to avoid. 

Also, any suggestions of good food, activities for grown ups will be appreciated and researched. ",2,1755937154.0,Toowoomba,16,0.67,False

1mxvssq,https://www.reddit.com/r/bondha_diaries/comments/1mxvssq/youve_got_one_shot_one_unique_story_to_write/,"You've got one shot, one unique story to write.","Life’s a wild ride—full of moments that make your heart race with joy and others that leave you staring at the ceiling at 3 a.m., worrying about what’s next. The advice to not take it *too* seriously is a reminder that getting bogged down in stress or perfectionism can rob you of the present. Worrying is natural; it’s your brain’s way of trying to problem-solve. But when it becomes a loop of “what ifs,” it’s like running on a hamster wheel—you’re exhausted but haven’t gone anywhere. Acknowledging concerns without letting them hijack your peace is key. For example, it’s okay to stress about a job interview, but don’t let it overshadow the fact that you’re alive, capable, and in the game.

You’ve got one shot, one unique story to write. That doesn’t mean you need to climb Everest or become a billionaire to make it count. It’s about recognizing that every day, every choice, is part of your singular journey. Striving for “good things” doesn’t always mean chasing grand achievements. It can be as simple as building stronger relationships, learning a new skill, or creating moments of joy—like savoring a perfect cup of coffee or laughing with friends until your sides hurt. The pursuit of “good” is personal; it’s about what lights ""you"" up, not what society’s highlight reel says you should want.

I’m a bit of a notification addict, so I reply fast. Right now I’m on a health kick and making big lifestyle changes to match, already dropped down 10kg!

* **GAMING -** this is my go-to hobby and what I spend most of my free time doing. Primarily a PC gamer, but also own a Switch 2 (and Steam Deck!) Currently playing Hollow Knight and Witchfire, before losing all my time to Path of Exile 2 on the 29th - I have a vast library of games across Steam and Switch, plus whatever is on Game Pass. I'm open to playing most games, especially co-op titles but actively **avoid** playing MMOs, MOBAs or any competitive shooters. Perhaps you could suggest a game we might enjoy together?

* **SOCIALIZING -** I’m a people person and always up for meeting and chatting with someone new. I love hosting screen shares for YouTube, movies, or shows, sending voice note updates instead of texts (sometimes), swapping random photos, and keeping the daily chatter going. I match whatever energy you bring, so if your style is never texting first or sending one-word replies… yeah, we’re probably not a match 😅 I'm also trying to better myself when it comes to confrontation...

***I'm usually available for voice calls / games in the evenings (9pm onwards GMT+1) or weekend mornings (8am - 4pm GMT+1), but otherwise I can text anytime!***
