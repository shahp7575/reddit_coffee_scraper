As the title says I just need this off. I dont really have any friends I can vent this to nor family I trust so here goes. Im getting married  very soon. I love my partner. Been together for almost a decade and I still feel as if I cant be away from him. Hes the love of my life. Hes honestly destroyed every bit of self confidence and self worth I've had. Its not on purpose. I know he loves me. I know im not a priority or a need for him as much as he is for me. I know it's bad to have this much codependency on someone but im scared of being alone. Always have been even as a kid. I've struggled with horrible depression in the past and while its been a very long time since its gotten bad, the memories are still ingrained in me no matter how much i just want to forget and move on. The last time being mother's day i think 2022? I wont be to  descriptive to much but it involved prescription pills. Never swallowed just let it sit there till my mouth was numb and just zoned out for a while. I've never spelled it out specifically but I know I've made it aware how it was for me multiple times back then. I just get a text of ""oh im sorry"" followed by ""im going to bed I love you goodnight"". I know I had horrible timing with this happening but I cant control when it happens. It hurt that there was never effort for me and I hate myself for being mad when his childhood best friend would text him saying stuff like im sorry and I love you to him.  my partner assumed  he was ending it and always made a point to rush to his place ASAP. I know this cause every time it occurred we were together. The last time it happened he rushed out on our date. I had to get a ride home from my sister. There's more tbh but i feel like this is to long already.  I won't leave. Ever. I love him. I love his family. They've supported me so much throughout the years any every way possible and theyre a healthy family to around. No one talks shit about each other. There's no walking on eggshells and theres no fear or toxicity at all. Just genuine love and support freely given. Im sorry this is so long and I will delete this soon, maybe in a day or to. If you've made this far then thank you. It genuinely means the world to me. I wish I cant let the past be the past and move on like the 20 something adult that I am. I wish I didn't have to beg for flowers once a month just to never get it unless im crying/begging. I wish I wasn't so insecure with myself that he doesn't find me attractive anymore and he would prefer if I was like the people he watches in porn. I wish I didn't feel stupid  and childish for asking for the same thing all the time because I'm scared to inconvenience him with getting me coffee once a week or surprise with flowers. I wish we could go out to places I enjoy without him looking miserable being there. I wish i was confident again. I wish i wasnt insecure and scared all the time. I wish that i was loved and cherished as much as he is to me. I wish things were different but you cant change the past. We will be married this year and I dont think anything will change, but the least I can do is hope. I love him to much to do so otherwise ",1,1759990750.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.99,False

I've finished 4/6 rounds of TAC chemo, with number 5 on Saturday.

Today, there was a local festival going on for Hangeul Day (we live in Korea). It was about 6 km away from our apartment, but my husband had already made plans to play in his company's soccer game. I almost gave up on going since my husband would need the car, but they were having an airshow that I knew my son would love to see. So, I threw on a mask, put my son on his bike, and off we went!

Halfway through the airshow, I almost cried because I honestly thought I would have 5 months of not being there for my son... but there we were, just SO happy. Hopefully, he's not going to remember the few days I wasn't there, but maybe he will remember the day that he and mom walked to the airshow, stopped for some coffee and juice, and had such a lovely day.

I remember, after learning about my treatment plan, that my number one concern was how much time I would lose with my 4-year-old. This diagnosis has really made me appreciate my time with him, and the idea that for five months I wouldn't really be there for him was the most upsetting thing for me to accept. However, just like I was told when I first showed up here scared, I still have the good weeks that are filled with days like today. They might not be walking 6 km with a 4 year old (*\*pats back\**), but they're filled with me being there for my son and making memories I'm happy to keep. Also, I taught myself to crochet and finished a beanie today!

Sorry if this is random, but I'm just really proud of myself. I don't think anyone else would get how hard it was to risk the exhaustion, the bone pain, the lack of available toilets, or the mental stress, but I thought maybe someone here would!",1,1759990743.0,breastcancer,0,1.0,False

Chapter 

**Chapter 1** 

Liam Archer lost a bet with his newly adopted “little sister.“. 

The punishment: be single for a month. 

So he handed me the divorce papers. “Just sign them. It’s only for a month. You’ve got to have a sense of sportsmanship.” 

I didn’t say anything. I just obediently wrote my name. 

Not long after, Liam lost another bet. 

09:53 

“This time, I have to spend the night with her. We’re just talking, nothing else. Don’t get any ideas.” As he spoke, a small, square foil packet fell out of his pocket. He cleared his throat, made an excuse about a work emergency, and headed for a hotel. 

Once he was gone, I replied to a message that had just come in. 

\[I’m leaving the country in a week. Want to come?\] 

\[Yes\] 

**1** 

The next day, I started packing. Halfway through, Liam, who hadn’t been home all night, walked in. There were fresh, angry red marks on his 

neck, and he yawned from lack of sleep. “Going on a trip?” 

I nodded, a knot of guilt in my stomach. 

Liam didn’t seem to notice anything was wrong. “It’s about time you got out. You’re always cooped up in this house, you have no idea what’s 

going on in the world. Not like Zoey. We can talk about anything.” 

Zoey. The “little sister” he’d met at a bar six months ago. They were inseparable, constantly making bets. The stakes started small–a coffee, a 

meal–but had escalated to hugs and kisses. 

I had cried. I had thrown fits. 

All it earned me was Liam’s disgust. “It’s just a game. Why do you have to be so serious?**”** 

Gradually, I stopped speaking up. So now, hearing him praise her at my expense, I just stayed silent and continued packing. 

After a moment, Liam asked, “When do you leave?” 

“Six days.” 

The next thing I knew, I was airborne. He lifted me, tossed me onto the bed, and pulled me into his warm embrace. “Don’t move. Just sleep 

with me for a bit.” 

I couldn’t break free. I was forced to breathe in the scent of another woman on his skin, my mind conjuring a chaotic slideshow of images. Tangled limbs, frantic passion, filth. 

Tears started to fall, hot and silent. 

Liam frowned, annoyed. He gave my back a few perfunctory pats. “You know, I’m the only one who could ever put up with you being so dramat- ic, Kiara.” 

“Without me, you’d be worse off than a stray dog on the street.” 

He repeated the same lines he’d said a thousand times before and slowly drifted off to sleep. I wiped my tears and carefully slipped out of his arms. Staring at the face I had loved for ten years, a cold resolve settled in my heart. 

Even if I had to live like a dog, I wouldn’t stay by his side any longer. 

**2** 

As the day of my departure grew closer, I started having vivid dreams of the past. 

The first time eight–year–old Liam saw me, he stared so intently that he tripped and fell flat on his face. It left a small, permanent scar on his 

forehead.

Chapter 1

He wore it like a badge of honor, announcing to everyone that he would be my one and only knight, protecting me for the rest of our lives. 

He was a boy of his word. When the chubby kid next door stole my candy, Liam cornered him in an alley after school and knocked out two of his teeth. When a girl in my class, Chloe, deliberately spilled ink on my dress, he drew ninety–nine hideous caricatures of her and plastered them all over the school, scaring her into staying home. 

Back then, wherever Kiara Reed was, Liam Archer was never more than a few feet away. We were inseparable. We were in love. 

Until eighth grade. 

On a perfectly ordinary day, my parents died in a plane crash. I was an orphan. My uncle took me in. I changed schools, moved my legal recor ds, and traveled thousands of miles to a new city down south. 

In that strange new world, I learned to go to school alone, to eat alone, to be alone. My days were full, but my heart was always empty. The day 

I was diagnosed with depression, the confused, accusatory look in my uncle’s eyes was a weight I couldn’t bear. 

I found myself standing at the foot of a thirty–story building, gazing up at the roof with a strange sense of longing. 

When I looked away, I saw him. Liam. 

I thought I was hallucinating, but he walked right up to me, his eyes shining like stars. “Kiara, I’ve been *going* crazy thinking about you.” 

I broke down, sobbing. “Take me with you. Please.” 

“I can’t stand it here anymore! The clothes get mildewed if you leave them out, and the roaches are indestructible!” 

Liam held me for a long time. Then he went to my uncle and got down on his knees. He swore an oath: “I will take care of Kiara. I’ll help her finish school, we’ll get into our dream college together. If I fail, may I die a horrible death.” 

And just like that, he took me home. 

After college, he married me. At our wedding, as he slipped the ring on my finger, he cried like a child and swore on his life, again, that he wou- Id make me happy forever. 

But now, I opened my eyes. The other side of our king–sized bed was empty and cold. Liam hadn’t been home in five days. The only way I knew what he was up to was through his social media. 

In his latest post, there was a sterile white gauze patch on his forehead, like he’d just had surgery. A comment below asked what happened. 

He replied: “Zoey said the old scar was ugly and ruined my good looks, so I had it removed.” 

I froze. 

The mark of my knight was gone. He wasn’t going to protect me anymore. 

It’s okay, I told myself. I was leaving tomorrow. There was no point in dwelling on it. But the sharp, needle–like pain in my heart was impossible 

to ignore. 

3 

A long time later, my phone buzzed with a new message. 

\[Get to Midnight Sun now.\] 

Midnight Sun was the city’s biggest and most exclusive nightclub, a chaotic, anything–goes place. It was also where Liam and Zoey had met. I hated it there. I put my phone down, pretending I hadn’t seen the message. 

Another one came through immediately. 

\[If you’re not here in an hour, you’re not going anywhere, ever.\] 

He knew I was leaving tomorrow. It was a threat. 

I gritted my teeth and went. 

As I pushed open the door to the designated VIP room, a roar of cheers erupted. 

“Forty–two minutes! Liam bet she’d be here in thirty! Liam loses! Zoey wins!”

1o1yaly,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o1yaly/endless_wake/,Endless Wake,"The ocean has witnessed centuries of history. Continents shifting, wars being fought, nations being formed. Colossal events that have molded civilization. Unfortunately, things like to slip between those monumental moments. People disappear, creatures are seen, and you would think the ocean would remember them, but it forgets just like us; fragments of time fall through the cracks and end up gone for good. No explanations found.

If I told you I’m one of those leaked memories, I’m sure you’d think I was joking. I wish I was joking. On October sixth, 1968, the USS Erebus was consumed by what I’ve begun to call the Endless Wake. Completely swallowed and, as far as I know, forgotten.

I suppose I should start at the beginning. Before I left the war, and before we ended up down here—at least I think it’s down. Early September of ‘68, the USS Stagnant returned and with it came a rumor about a ghost ship. A vessel left adrift, suspected to be used by Viet Cong forces, abandoned by all who sailed on it. No signs of conflict either. Just abandoned. My crew chalked that up to sleep deprivation; they had been out for three weeks. Some of the men swore they saw sea creatures floating out of the wake, as though they were swimming in air instead of water. The second shift claimed to have shot down a shark, but when everyone demanded proof, they said it simply fell back into the water.

On September twelfth, USS Misty Gorge sailed out. The men from Stagnant continued discussing the rumors. Each one, more elaborate. One floating around was that a voice whispered to them at night, sleeping in their bunks. The second shift backed this up, saying the voice was louder outside. It begged them to look down, to view the beauty of the Wake behind them. They searched the deck for whoever was speaking, even checked the room holding the PA system. They said they found nothing, figured at that point it was an enemy ship fucking with them. One man stopped me before we went to the barracks; he told me not to say anything, but when his shift swept the coast, there were no enemy ships out.

The chatter died out around a week after September twelfth. The chaos of the war overshadowed whatever ominous events were happening in the ocean. Who can worry about an abandoned ship when you have explosives raining down on you? Man, that's something I don’t miss about that side.

Supply deliveries were rare at that moment; the Viet Cong liked to hide in the trees near the main road. Every time we tried to find them, they seemed to vanish into the forest, like ghosts of the past. Besides that, the following two weeks were quiet. Except for one incident.

We found an enemy soldier in the woods near the coast. Most of these guys would rather die than give up during this war, but this guy was different. He was weeping, his eyes red and raw. He kept mumbling to himself in Vietnamese. We found one of the higher-ups fluent in the language; we asked him what the hell the guy was saying. He looked at us confused and said, “Beware the Endless Wake?” He just keeps repeating that phrase.

We asked the man what he was talking about; the officer translated for us, yet still the man kept muttering, “Beware the Endless Wake.” We started carrying him toward the base. Near the dock, he began screaming, shaking his head over and over. “Không!” He broke free, snatched a pistol from another man. Trembling, he pointed the gun at us. Then, in sudden realization, he turned it on himself.

We cleaned up the mess, and foolishly figured the soldier was shellshocked from the war. The final week flew by. The Misty returned, and with it more rumors. The same tall tales from the Stagnant were echoed by the Gorge crew. This time they all agreed to one detail: they swore there was one more man on the ship, though no one could remember who, or even if there was such a person.

This got our crew antsy for our patrol shift. Three weeks out in the supposedly haunted ocean, the possibility of seeing the rotting metal corpse of a forgotten warship. The beginning of October lingered in front of us; excitement and fear seemed to flow through us.

As the first approached, the fear of the unknown seemed to dampen down, replaced by the fear of not being able to come home. Afraid of being blown to bits by a platoon of strangers hidden in the woods, of being spotted and sunk by an enemy ship. Buried at sea, never to set foot on your homeland again. Deep down it felt unfair, yet also justified.

Anxiety crawled through the barracks and settled on the crew of the USS Erebus. Men usually excited for this trip seemed anxious, and those usually anxious to go on patrols seemed excited. Who would have thought Tommy “Fat Lip” Lorenzo was a superstitious person? The next day we would be heading out to ensure not only the safety of our colleagues but to possibly see an urban legend live and in color.

Despite the tension, the first day was quiet. No creepy shit, no enemies. It was almost too peaceful. Usually the noise of far combat or the chatter of radios filled the air. It felt like leaving the house without your wallet. Off-kilter, like a piece of us had been stripped away and we didn’t know which one. We should have been enjoying the silence; hell, we were surrounded by chaos every day, we should have been grateful. But we weren’t. Men worried something was coming. Maybe a massive Viet Cong ambush, maybe worse. Others simply disliked the lack of noise; they needed to hear something to keep their minds busy. I remember seeing a single gull fly over us, its caw echoed across the ocean. That was the only noise we heard that day. We filled the odd silence and tried to ignore the encroaching anxiety by making conversation.

There were three of us that night, sitting near the rear of the ship: me, Johnny Shulster, and Billy Reyes. We were already off shift, and Billy was in the middle of telling us a story about his brother.

“So this motherfucker leaps out of the second-story window, completely fucking naked, just to get out of the room before this lady’s husband opened the door…”

Me and Johnny were laughing; Billy always had oddball stories to entertain us on these patrols. He was starting to tell us what his brother broke when we heard it.

Whirrrrrrrrrrr.

A chorus of motors began getting closer to us. The guns above us thundered bullets into the dark, stopping one of the three. The second whizzed over to the right, out of our sight. The third peppered the railing with a few shots; we ducked. After a few seconds, I peeked out. Expecting to be shot at, I saw… nothing.

The second boat went down under our fire. The third should’ve been right behind us, but it was gone. Not sunk. Not hiding. Just… gone.

We met up with a handful more of the first shift. Fat Lip looked like he saw a ghost, while Lobosky was laughing like a clown in the corner.

“They… vanished. I saw it,” Fat Lip muttered, only to be muffled by Lobosky: “Those pussies ran! Tried to sneak up on us and fled when we fought back!” He laughed a hearty laugh, clapped Tommy on the back, and went to his room.

Tommy looked at us, his eyes glazed over, like a toddler about to cry. “It shouldn’t have been possible…” he muttered. Before we could ask what he was talking about, he stumbled towards the door. We followed, seeing him leaning on the railing, staring into the wake behind us.

“Let’s leave him… he needs his space,” Shulster muttered, watching Tommy lean on the railing, staring into the wake.

Billy agreed: “Yeah, he probably just has to process the kills he just saw.”

I couldn’t decide what to do at that moment; Fat Lip had either lost his mind or his innocence. For someone who bragged about winning bar fights, I never expected him to be so rattled. I walked over to him; he was muttering to himself, “Ignore it… don’t answer their cries.” He was repeating himself, trying to convince himself not to do something. He turned and looked at me, tears running down his face, “They… need me.” With that, he threw himself over the railing. Splashing into the water below, slowly drifting farther from us. I panicked and threw the life preserver towards where he fell. Spotlights shined towards the rear of the ship, no one was there. No clothing, no preserver. Nothing. I stared into that water for a while that night, waiting to hear him scream, or a splash. Anything. But the ocean gave me nothing back… no sound, no ripple, just the pale churn of the Wake, rolling on forever as though it hadn’t swallowed a man at all. I felt sick—not like I was going to vomit, but like I wanted to just sleep. Sleep and do nothing else: no eating, no talking, no seeing. Only sleep.

I stayed in my room the next night. I didn’t want to see the sea any longer than I had to. I caught myself staring off a few times, looking at the sea as though it was speaking to me. I never heard it speak—not that day at least. I sat on my bed, staring at the ceiling, thinking about Tommy. About how he was there and then he wasn’t.

This ate at me. Not that a man was gone—no, that was normal for me now. Being in ‘Nam meant men leaving this realm daily, gone with the wind just like leaves. Those lives lost at least had explanations: shot, stabbed, blown to bits. They were explainable. Tommy was eaten, devoured by the big blue mass below us. Unexplainable, most likely skewed into a story of suicide by the government. I could hear them now: “The stress of war got to him. Thoughts and prayers.” I ended up falling asleep thinking about how unfair life seemed to be, how easily it was to be forgotten, thrown under a carpet and left to rot.

It was day three when I saw it. Fish floating in the sky. It was the middle of the day, mid-shift, around 1 p.m., a school of fish began circling the ship. Slowly, almost curiously. Nobody said a word. We watched together in awe as this happened, and just like they appeared, they abruptly vanished. I waited for someone else to mention it first, so I knew I wasn't hallucinating, yet no one spoke. Each person moved on in their daily routines, unfazed by what they just witnessed. As though it didn’t process in them, that reality just broke right in front of them. I carried on the same as them.

That night before I went to sleep, a hushed voice seemed to whisper in my ear: “Join ussss.”

I sat up in my bed and shot looks around my room, trying to find the source of the voice. Had a civilian stowed away? I got up and looked under my bed. Nothing except my shoes rested below. I opened my door; a vacant hallway greeted me. I rubbed my head—a few more months of this and I could go home.

Man, I miss home…

Anyway, I laid back down. I had to rise at 6 a.m. the next morning. As soon as I shut off the lights, “We need you… join ussss.” For at least two hours the voice harassed me, demanding I go with them, join them in some elite place. I’m not sure if the voice stopped or if I fell asleep; either way, the next thing I knew was that it was 5:30 a.m., and I needed to shave.

The voice is hard to explain, I’ve heard it every day since that night and I still can’t place my finger on it. It’s feminine, yet not human. Uncanny, almost heavenly. It was intoxicating, it still is, but I know better. The only thing I can compare it to is sirens. It was as though the voice of a siren had separated from its body and become its own being.

We ended night three with 219 men. Day four began with 218. I haven’t a clue who it was this time. Who next was going to be written off as a suicide, despite falling prey to something larger. I asked around, yet it seemed nobody recalled who it was either. By midday there were more flying fish, again we stared in awe at the beautiful phenomenon being performed in front of us. Multiple schools spun around the Erebus, becoming a colorful tornado. I heard the voice in my ear, like someone whispering behind me: Join usssss… I found myself walking toward the railing, gazing at the wake. Wistfully I wondered if it was better on that side. No war perhaps, no geopolitics. Maybe the wake held peace, an escape from the chaos surrounding us.

The thundering roar of the guns shook me out of my fugue state. A fishing boat speeding towards us became a ball of flames. I watched as the debris seemed to sink into the wake behind us. Gone. Continuing my rotation, I saw Joel Lobosky; he looked pale, yet still tried to keep up his bravado. In a weak, almost whimpering voice he said, “Hell yeah, we killed those fuckers real good!” He slapped me on the shoulder and then left. He kept glancing behind himself, trying to catch the invisible follower he thought he had.

Later that night, the alarm sounded. Shulster ran up to me. “Lobosky jumped! Joel jumped!”

Together we ran to the back of the ship. Just in time to see his hand sink below the surface, a life preserver floating next to him. Slowly that became consumed too. Shulster thought maybe Joel was trying to grab at it, but the truth sat in my chest like a rock. It had been consumed. A whisper seemingly taunted me: Gaze upon the beauty, join ussss…

Fighting the urge of the voice, I stumbled back to my room. Once alone the voice seemed to grow louder, yet still stayed at a hushed whisper. The lack of wind amplified it. Alone I fought the temptation to join Tommy and Joel, to see what waited for me below the wake. I shut my light out early and tried to fall asleep. The voice pestered me: join usss…See our beauty. Hours seemed like days as this went on, until I once again fell asleep, or perhaps the voice stopped.

Day five is when things went completely sideways. Nonstop fish circled the ship, and the whisper became more persistent, begging me to join them. I chewed on my cheek until it hurt, trying to ignore the invisible siren. At one point, all noise seemed to stop; men halted their conversations and stared at the newest performance. A whale rose from the waters, still swimming around, and with it came its call. It sang for us, danced around the ship with grace, and then it dived back down. I wanted to applaud; some men did, slow and methodical, as though moving in a trance. The voice whispered in my ear: “Come below… there's more to show.” I gripped the railing tight, my knuckles white. The voice now promised euphoria, pleasure beyond my imagination. I gripped the railing harder. Behind me, I heard a splash.

“We have one overboard!” bellowed someone, followed by another splash. Around six men leaped into the ocean, swimming toward the Wake. The first sailor reached it and stopped. He let himself float in the Wake and was consumed. Others tried to save the swimmers; they ignored the preservers and swam right by them.

One sailor jumped in to try and stop someone. The swimmer punched him and dragged him toward the Wake. He fought like hell to escape, but the swimmer had him in a headlock. They both sank. No sign of life remained.

After that, we adjusted the shift schedule. I was given a double shift, replacing the sailor who had been dragged in. I stayed up the entire time. They told me I could take a fifteen-minute break, but I refused. I needed to watch the Wake, to witness what happened at night.

I was excited; butterflies fluttered in my stomach. I hadn’t felt that way since high school, asking out Betty Sue. I wondered about her now. I wondered if Ma and Pa remembered me, or if there was just a void in their minds where I once existed.

I sat on deck watching the sunset behind clouds tinged with agent orange. As terrified and excited as I was, I didn’t envy the men in the forests, fighting for their lives against an invisible enemy. That, I thought, was Hell: sudden and unfair. Perhaps being consumed was the better alternative, less messy, less tragic.

Around 11:30 p.m., the voice returned. Gone was the hushed, seductive tone; it was loud now, drill-instructor loud: “Join us! Come down here, dammit!”

I flinched as it grew louder; my ears ached. In the distance, another splash. Nobody rushed to rescue them; we continued our work. The voice berated me: “You are a worthless maggot!”

I spent hours ignoring it, occupied myself by mopping the deck. As I finished, a man walked by and leaped into the water. The Wake took him. I stood near the railing, away from the rear, as the voice yelled. I gripped the railing tighter, staring deep into the ocean.

Billy caught my attention. “Oi, O’Neil. What the hell are you doing?”

I blinked and looked at him. “What time is it?”

“5 a.m. Why? Can’t wait to get off shift?”

“...Yeah. Can’t wait.”

We went to the cafeteria and got coffee. Billy joined me for the rest of my shift; it was only two more hours.

“These guys keep jumping, man. Crazy shit,” Billy said.

“Yeah, no one’s trying to rescue them…” I replied.

“No point. They resist. Just another part of the war, I guess.” He shrugged. I nodded. This felt different.

We lapped the deck a few times, occasional splashes heard. I peeked at swimmers going toward the Wake. The voice continued, deafening at times, urging me to jump. I resisted.

Then I realized something: moving objects were never consumed. A man had to float to be devoured. I grabbed rope and a life preserver.

“What the hell are you doing?” Billy called. I ignored him and threw the tethered preserver into the Wake. It sank. Another, the same. I knew then: we had to keep moving. It wanted us to stop, to float into its mouth.

Before I could explain, the alarm rose. A ghostly fishing boat drifted toward us, engine humming weakly, empty of crew. By the time it was behind us, the engine died. The ship began to sink. Over the PA, the captain shouted to save whatever was on board.

We couldn’t stop. If we did, we’d be below the sea with Tommy and Lobosky. Billy and I sprinted toward the navigation room, but it was locked. The anchor dropped. The ship shifted nearly vertical. Men poured into the Wake. Billy fell first; I heard only the start of a swear, then a splash. I refused to give in. The water rose to my waist. I let go of the railing and swam away, only to be ambushed by bullets. I searched for cover, nowhere to hide but below. I looked at the sinking ship one last time, then dove, embracing the Wake instead of death. Everything went black.

When I woke, I was back on the ship. No noise, nobody talking. Other drenched seamen moved silently. I walked out, greeted by calm. The ocean was still. Something was wrong.

We’ve been sailing for forty-five days. No ambushes. The captain said the enemy might still be out there. I already know we’ve been forgotten. This is where forgotten memories go. A place so peaceful and wrong that it feels natural for memories to be abandoned here. I thought about other wrecks—how they were remembered.

Some ships are remembered forever: The Lithuania, The Titanic.  
 Others fade: remembered a few lifetimes, then forgotten.  
 Some never have a chance. The Wake devours all, and the world forgets.",1,1759989689.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 1** 

Liam Archer lost a bet with his newly adopted “little sister.“. 

The punishment: be single for a month. 

So he handed me the divorce papers. “Just sign them. It’s only for a month. You’ve got to have a sense of sportsmanship.” 

I didn’t say anything. I just obediently wrote my name. 

Not long after, Liam lost another bet. 

09:53 

“This time, I have to spend the night with her. We’re just talking, nothing else. Don’t get any ideas.” As he spoke, a small, square foil packet fell out of his pocket. He cleared his throat, made an excuse about a work emergency, and headed for a hotel. 

Once he was gone, I replied to a message that had just come in. 

\[I’m leaving the country in a week. Want to come?\] 

\[Yes\] 

**1** 

The next day, I started packing. Halfway through, Liam, who hadn’t been home all night, walked in. There were fresh, angry red marks on his 

neck, and he yawned from lack of sleep. “Going on a trip?” 

I nodded, a knot of guilt in my stomach. 

Liam didn’t seem to notice anything was wrong. “It’s about time you got out. You’re always cooped up in this house, you have no idea what’s 

going on in the world. Not like Zoey. We can talk about anything.” 

Zoey. The “little sister” he’d met at a bar six months ago. They were inseparable, constantly making bets. The stakes started small–a coffee, a 

meal–but had escalated to hugs and kisses. 

I had cried. I had thrown fits. 

All it earned me was Liam’s disgust. “It’s just a game. Why do you have to be so serious?**”** 

Gradually, I stopped speaking up. So now, hearing him praise her at my expense, I just stayed silent and continued packing. 

After a moment, Liam asked, “When do you leave?” 

“Six days.” 

The next thing I knew, I was airborne. He lifted me, tossed me onto the bed, and pulled me into his warm embrace. “Don’t move. Just sleep 

with me for a bit.” 

I couldn’t break free. I was forced to breathe in the scent of another woman on his skin, my mind conjuring a chaotic slideshow of images. Tangled limbs, frantic passion, filth. 

Tears started to fall, hot and silent. 

Liam frowned, annoyed. He gave my back a few perfunctory pats. “You know, I’m the only one who could ever put up with you being so dramat- ic, Kiara.” 

“Without me, you’d be worse off than a stray dog on the street.” 

He repeated the same lines he’d said a thousand times before and slowly drifted off to sleep. I wiped my tears and carefully slipped out of his arms. Staring at the face I had loved for ten years, a cold resolve settled in my heart. 

Even if I had to live like a dog, I wouldn’t stay by his side any longer. 

**2** 

As the day of my departure grew closer, I started having vivid dreams of the past. 

The first time eight–year–old Liam saw me, he stared so intently that he tripped and fell flat on his face. It left a small, permanent scar on his 

forehead.

He wore it like a badge of honor, announcing to everyone that he would be my one and only knight, protecting me for the rest of our lives. 

He was a boy of his word. When the chubby kid next door stole my candy, Liam cornered him in an alley after school and knocked out two of his teeth. When a girl in my class, Chloe, deliberately spilled ink on my dress, he drew ninety–nine hideous caricatures of her and plastered them all over the school, scaring her into staying home. 

Back then, wherever Kiara Reed was, Liam Archer was never more than a few feet away. We were inseparable. We were in love. 

Until eighth grade. 

On a perfectly ordinary day, my parents died in a plane crash. I was an orphan. My uncle took me in. I changed schools, moved my legal recor ds, and traveled thousands of miles to a new city down south. 

In that strange new world, I learned to go to school alone, to eat alone, to be alone. My days were full, but my heart was always empty. The day 

I was diagnosed with depression, the confused, accusatory look in my uncle’s eyes was a weight I couldn’t bear. 

I found myself standing at the foot of a thirty–story building, gazing up at the roof with a strange sense of longing. 

When I looked away, I saw him. Liam. 

I thought I was hallucinating, but he walked right up to me, his eyes shining like stars. “Kiara, I’ve been *going* crazy thinking about you.” 

I broke down, sobbing. “Take me with you. Please.” 

“I can’t stand it here anymore! The clothes get mildewed if you leave them out, and the roaches are indestructible!” 

Liam held me for a long time. Then he went to my uncle and got down on his knees. He swore an oath: “I will take care of Kiara. I’ll help her finish school, we’ll get into our dream college together. If I fail, may I die a horrible death.” 

And just like that, he took me home. 

After college, he married me. At our wedding, as he slipped the ring on my finger, he cried like a child and swore on his life, again, that he wou- Id make me happy forever. 

But now, I opened my eyes. The other side of our king–sized bed was empty and cold. Liam hadn’t been home in five days. The only way I knew what he was up to was through his social media. 

In his latest post, there was a sterile white gauze patch on his forehead, like he’d just had surgery. A comment below asked what happened. 

He replied: “Zoey said the old scar was ugly and ruined my good looks, so I had it removed.” 

I froze. 

The mark of my knight was gone. He wasn’t going to protect me anymore. 

It’s okay, I told myself. I was leaving tomorrow. There was no point in dwelling on it. But the sharp, needle–like pain in my heart was impossible 

to ignore.

A long time later, my phone buzzed with a new message. 

\[Get to Midnight Sun now.\] 

Midnight Sun was the city’s biggest and most exclusive nightclub, a chaotic, anything–goes place. It was also where Liam and Zoey had met. I hated it there. I put my phone down, pretending I hadn’t seen the message. 

Another one came through immediately. 

\[If you’re not here in an hour, you’re not going anywhere, ever.\] 

He knew I was leaving tomorrow. It was a threat. 

I gritted my teeth and went. 

As I pushed open the door to the designated VIP room, a roar of cheers erupted. 

“Forty–two minutes! Liam bet she’d be here in thirty! Liam loses! Zoey wins!”

Another one came through immediately. 

\[If you’re not here in an hour, you’re not going anywhere, ever.\] 

He knew I was leaving tomorrow. It was a threat. 

I gritted my teeth and went.

1o1y9i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1o1y9i6/nelson_demille_books_in_order/,Nelson DeMille Books In Order,"Hey everyone! I've been meaning to chat about a fantastic author who's kept me glued to pages for years: Nelson DeMille. If you're looking to dive into some really engaging thrillers, getting started with his books, perhaps even in order, is a great idea. You can find a helpful guide right here: [Nelson DeMille Books In Order](https://pdfhive.com/nelson-demille-books-in-order/). Today, I want to talk about one of his standout works, *Plum Island*, which kicks off his famous John Corey series.

### A Quick Peek at *Plum Island* (No Spoilers!)

So, *Plum Island* introduces us to John Corey, a New York City homicide detective recovering from gunshot wounds. He's temporarily assigned to an anti-terrorist task force on Long Island, and let me tell you, he’s not your typical cop. When a wealthy couple is brutally murdered on the mysterious Plum Island, Corey finds himself pulled into a complex web of secrets, piracy, and a conspiracy that goes far deeper than he could imagine. It’s a classic whodunit, but with a whole lot of extra layers and a truly unique protagonist.

### What I Absolutely Loved

What I absolutely adore about DeMille, and particularly in *Plum Island*, is his writing style. He has this incredible knack for sharp, witty dialogue, and John Corey's internal monologue is just brilliant. Corey is cynical, sarcastic, and completely unfiltered, which makes him incredibly human and laugh-out-loud funny at times. You feel like you're right there with him, experiencing his frustrations and his dry observations about everything. The pacing is fantastic too; it builds slowly, drawing you into the mystery, then really picks up speed with twists and turns you won't see coming. DeMille’s descriptions of Long Island and Plum Island itself really set the mood, adding a layer of atmospheric tension.

### A Small Note for Fellow Readers

If I had to find something that might not appeal to everyone, it would be John Corey's relentless sarcasm. While I personally love it, some readers might find it a bit much or occasionally distracting from the serious plot. Also, DeMille isn't afraid to take his time with details, which I appreciate, but for those who prefer an instant, breakneck pace from page one, it might feel like a slow burn at the very beginning. However, stick with it, because the payoff is totally worth it.

### So, Would I Recommend It?

A resounding YES! If you're a fan of thrillers, police procedurals, or just genuinely enjoy a character who marches to the beat of his own drum, you absolutely have to pick this one up. It’s perfect for casual readers who enjoy getting lost in a good mystery with plenty of humor. If you've been considering diving into Nelson DeMille's work, this is an excellent starting point for the John Corey series. It’s a solid read that will keep you guessing and entertained. If this sounds like an author for you, or you’re curious about his other works and their chronology, this resource on [Nelson DeMille Books In Order](https://pdfhive.com/nelson-demille-books-in-order/) is fantastic.

### Tips for New Readers (Or Anyone Needing a Little Reading Boost!)

Now, for anyone new to reading thrillers, or maybe new to reading for pleasure altogether, here are a few friendly tips:

*   **Start with an engaging series:** Like Nelson DeMille's John Corey books! Knowing there’s a whole world to explore with the same characters can be really motivating.
*   **Don't feel pressured to finish:** It's okay if a book isn't grabbing you. Put it down and try another! Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore.
*   **Find your comfort zone:** Whether it's a comfy chair, a quiet corner, or with a cup of coffee, make reading a pleasant ritual.
*   **Take breaks when you need them:** Sometimes a chapter or two is all you can manage. That's perfectly fine. Even small steps add up.
*   **Engage with other readers:** Join communities like this one! Talking about books makes the experience even richer and can help you discover new favorites.

Reading is an amazing adventure, and authors like Nelson DeMille craft incredible worlds to explore. Don't be shy about starting your journey; there's a book out there waiting just for you.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

We are living together for 6 months na.

He pays 70% to 80% of our household bills. Nakita ko dun na he is putting savings on future house, car, vacation which is the one I suggested a month ago and sa self walang laman but a sad face.

I do pay for the majority of our food pero ugali niya kasi na bilhan pa din ako ng little things that he thinks I need or actually need.  Like toiletries at paminsan minsan chocolates and coffee.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1o1y2i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/polls/comments/1o1y2i1/which_magic_item_will_you_choose_effects_in/,Which magic item will you choose? (Effects in description),"You walk into the local pawn shop, just to browse, as you've done a hundred times before. As you're walking around the store, you notice something different. A small table in the back corner, with 5 items, placed randomly on it. A small paper sign on the table says ""pick one"" in black marker. As you look at the items more closely, you somehow know what they do, and you can tell there's something powerful about them. Looking over them more closely, you see:


A golden ring with the metal twisted into a braid pattern. If you put this ring on, you will have the ability to summon any amount of money to your hand that you need for any situation. It will be in whatever form and currency type you need, and will not have any inflationary effect, and the government also won't come after you for this. Buying a 5 dollar coffee? A 5 dollar bill appears in your hand. Buying something expensive? A card will appear in your hand with the exact amount you need. The ring cannot be stolen, lost, or used by others.


A vial of blue, faintly glowing liquid. You can tell that, if you drink this, you will become much stronger, both physically and mentally. First, you will be transformed into the bodytype that you desire. You'll also be at the pinnacle of human strength, speed, endurance, etc. even if your desired body doesn't look like it. You will not need to work to maintain this body. You will never get sick, and any illnesses you currently have will be permanently cured. This also includes any mental illnesses, so no depression, anxiety, etc. Though this also doesn't take away from any natural emotional depth. The government will also not experiment on you and nobody will question these changes. You'll still need sleep, to use the restroom, etc. and will not become at the peak of human intellect 

A device with a small touchscreen, and one button labeled ""Save"" and another labeled ""Load"" this is a device that has 3 empty Save files. When you press ""Save"" the current moment in time will be saved to the device, and you can press the ""Load"" button, and doing so will transport you back (or forwards) to the exact moment you pressed save. You can save 3 different moments, and can always load to them, unless you save over them with a new moment. If you override a moment, you can't get it back. This also can't be stolen from you, used by others or lost

A silver box chain necklace, with a subtle iridescent sheen across it. If you put this on, you gain a variety of psychic powers. Telekinesis, telepathic communication, mind reading, as well as psychic suggestion (the ability to subtly influence a person's ideas as well as implant thoughts into their head. Not full on mind control.) People will not know if you use your powers on them, or in general, unless it's clear based of what they can see and hear. As long as you're not being malicious, you won't be investigated or get in trouble for using your powers. The necklace can't be stolen, lost, or used by others. 

And finally, a small coin made of gray, cracked stone. On the heads side is a shooting star, and on tails, an hourglass. As you look at it, you feel the hairs on the back of your neck raise. If you flip this coin and land heads, you get to make a wish. However, if you land tails twice in a row, you are frozen in time for a week, but still fully conscious. Each time this triggers, the duration of the next time you're frozen in time is double the previous time. There is nothing you can do to mitigate or remove this downside. You can't rig the coin in any way, or change the amount of time in any way with wishes. You can also not change your perception of time or erase time or anything of the like to avoid it. There is no possible way to avoid the downside. Along with those rules, you also cannot wish for more wishes in any way. You can only generate wishes through the coin, and can't increase the amount you get in any way. You also cannot wish you any of the other magic items, or their effects. This item can't be lost, destroyed or used on others, but people will question the effects of wishes unless you wish for them not to. 

So, after weighing your options, what will you pick?

1o1y2f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1o1y2f2/my_husbands_secretary_got_injured_learning_rock/,My husband's secretary got injured learning rock climbing from me,"My husband's secretary got injured learning rock climbing from me, and when my husband found out, he hung me from a hundred-meter cliff.



When I led my rock climbing training camp members to challenge a famous seaside cliff, my husband's secretary Isabella joined us.



Despite my repeated warnings before we started that she needed to change into proper climbing shoes and wear a safety harness and helmet, she insisted on wearing fashionable ankle boots and casual pants.



As a result, she was gasping for breath and had developed bloody blisters on her hands by the time we'd only climbed a third of the way up.



""Can you pull me up? I really can't hold on anymore,"" Isabella pleaded with me.



I handed her a spare sling and tried to comfort her: ""Just hold on for another five meters. There's a ledge ahead where you can rest, and I'll have someone lower you down.""



She had no choice but to reluctantly continue climbing with me.



The next day, when my husband \*\*Alexander Walsh\*\* found out what happened, he coldly questioned me: ""Do you realize that Isabella went straight home with a high fever and had to be rushed to the hospital?""



I was completely puzzled: ""I explained from the beginning that the route had a drop of over sixty meters. She couldn't even handle twenty meters. Why did she insist on going in the first place?""



Alexander fell silent for a moment, then his tone suddenly softened: ""You're right. You've been working hard.""



He handed me a cup of coffee.



After drinking it, I fell into a deep sleep.



But when I woke up, I found myself \*\*halfway down a cliff\*\*, my hands bound with rope to a fragile anchor point, my feet dangling over the bottomless ocean waves.



Not far away, Alexander stood on the observation platform at the cliff's edge with Isabella in his arms, looking down coldly: ""Since you're so good at rock climbing, let me see how you climb back to the top with your bare hands.""



I hadn't expected him to start a live stream, broadcasting my situation instantly across the globe through \*\*YouTube Live\*\* and \*\*TikTok\*\*.



Countless viewers witnessed my desperate state.



I immediately gritted my teeth and spoke into the radio, dialing a number: ""Stop watching and come get me. Now.""



...



The sea wind cut across my face like knives, and the humid air at the cliff's edge made my breathing labored. Below, the waves thundered against the rock face like death's drumbeat.



The live stream chat was scrolling densely:



\*\[Quick, place your bets! I bet she won't last two hours!\]\*



\*\[If she can climb up, I'll eat rope!\]\*



They typed while waiting to watch the spectacle.



Alexander sat on the platform edge at the cliff top with Isabella in his arms, handing her a glass of iced wine. In that instant, condensation slid down the glass in the cold wind, glinting like deliberate mockery of my parched lips.



He looked down at me leisurely, his voice as cold as the cliff's night wind: ""If you want to leave here, you have two choices—climb up yourself, or kneel and apologize to Isabella.""



Isabella lowered her eyes, appearing both sympathetic and helpless: ""Alexander, forget it. It's my fault for being too weak and causing trouble for Chloe.""



I looked at her delicate appearance, clearly understanding that expression was just her usual weapon.



Sure enough, Alexander's gaze grew colder: ""Stop pretending to be innocent. Chloe, you're just jealous of Isabella, so you deliberately made things difficult for her. Today, I'll make you pay the price.""



His voice dragged me back to those unbearable memories.



Just three years into our marriage, Alexander brought Isabella into the company as his secretary, though in reality... I knew she was his mistress.



Just because I once asked Isabella to lower the air conditioning temperature and she refused because she was cold, when she caught a cold afterward, Alexander locked me in the company's freezer for an entire night.



He said coldly: ""You like the cold so much? Then stay here and reflect.""



That whole night, I survived with only a thin UV protection shirt. When I walked out of that door, my heart was already deeply scarred.



Later, he simply forbade me from entering the company again. I started my own rock climbing training camp and built the career I have today.



And now, when Isabella got into trouble because she didn't follow the rules, Alexander still blamed me.



He never loved me. Thinking of this, my eyes uncontrollably welled up.



Alexander froze when he saw me like this, a flash of sympathy crossing his gaze.



But before he could say anything, Isabella leaned against his shoulder, her voice pitiful and fragile: ""She's crying over something this minor... When my hands got blisters, I didn't shed a single tear.""



Alexander's face immediately darkened, as if infuriated: ""It's all because of you that Isabella suffered so much. Take off Chloe's gloves—let her experience what bare-handed climbing feels like!""

2

\## Chapter 2



The bodyguards at the cliff top moved on command, rappelling down the safety rope toward my position.



In the howling wind, I saw those black-gloved hands reaching for my wrists—



The live stream chat had already exploded:



\*\[Take off the gloves! Let her try bare rock!\]\*



\*\[Now this is getting interesting!\]\*



\*\[I bet a hundred bucks she'll be crying and begging in less than an hour!\]\*



The bodyguard's shadow fell over me as he leaned down, grabbing my protective gloves without room for refusal.



""Let go—"" I instinctively tried to shake him off, but on the slippery rock face, this resistance was weak and laughable. The next second, my climbing gloves were forcibly stripped off, along with the thick finger protectors.



My bare palms were immediately cut by the sharp rocks, blood seeping out. The cold wind poured into the wounds, painful as thousands of needles.



The live stream chat instantly exploded:



\*\[Now this is a real extreme challenge!\]\*



\*\[Her hands are all cut up, hahaha!\]\*



\*\[I bet two hundred she'll be crying and begging in half an hour!\]\*



Isabella leaned into Alexander's embrace, seemingly casually stroking her own slender hands, her voice carrying satisfaction: ""Alexander, that's enough. Chloe has never suffered much since childhood—she probably won't be able to handle even a few minutes.""



I laughed coldly, raising my eyes to stare directly into the camera: ""Stop pretending to be innocent. You couldn't handle twenty meters because of your own lack of fitness. How is that anyone else's fault? I warned you about all the problems and advised you not to come, but you insisted. Who's to blame for that?""



Isabella's smile stiffened for a moment before quickly returning to her pitiful expression: ""She's badmouthing me again. I didn't want to be so physically weak either.""



Alexander's gaze immediately turned cold: ""Looks like you haven't learned your lesson yet.""



He signaled to the bodyguard: ""Go install some loose pitons in the route ahead.""



I heard the thin scraping of metal against rock as sharp pitons glinted coldly in the wind. They looked stable on the surface but would come loose with any pressure, waiting for me to step on them.



Every step I climbed higher, my fingers and toes could be dragged down by suddenly failing pitons, my heart clenching as if it might explode.



Blood dripped from between my fingers, blown by the wind into dark red streaks.



The live stream comments rolled frantically:



\*\[God, this is too brutal!\]\*



\*\[I feel the pain just watching!\]\*



\*\[No way, I'm changing my bet—she can climb up. This woman's eyes are too fierce.\]\*



The private doctor standing at the cliff top finally couldn't stay silent: ""Boss, this will cause serious problems if it continues.""



Alexander only looked down at me, his tone terrifyingly calm: ""I'll keep an eye on her. I'm just making her understand—some people shouldn't be crossed.""



Isabella gently tugged at his sleeve, her voice soft: ""That's all an act. She climbs dozens of meters of cliff with students every day. Didn't you say that she should experience the suffering I went through on the rock face?""



Alexander narrowed his eyes, seemingly reignited by her words.



Just as the live stream comments were going wild, a prominent message suddenly flooded the screen—



\*\[Anonymous user bets ten million USD: Chloe Miller will climb the cliff herself.\]\*

3

\## Chapter 3



That ten million dollar bet in the live stream exploded like a bomb, igniting all the comments.



\*\[Holy shit! Ten million?!\]\*



\*\[This can't be real—she must have connections!\]\*



Alexander's gaze slowly darkened, falling on me like a blade: ""Tell me, who placed that bet for you? Is it some man you're keeping on the side?""



I lifted my head to meet his stare, cold as if separated by a wall of ice: ""That's none of your business. Once I climb up, we're getting divorced.""



Those words landed, and Alexander's face instantly turned dark, his knuckles tensing, veins bulging.



""Divorce?"" He let out a low laugh, cold and humorless. ""You really think you can walk away unscathed?""



He turned to the bodyguards, his voice icy: ""Since this is a climbing challenge, let's make it more realistic. Go throw some rocks down.""



My heart suddenly seized, blood seeming to drain instantly from my body, my face going pale.



Soon, several bodyguards lifted boulders and pushed them toward my climbing route.



The whistling sound accompanied the falling stones as they brushed past me, bringing frigid wind and crashing heavily into the waves. The splashing white foam shot skyward, as if mocking my insignificance.



""Alexander! Are you insane!"" I shouted through gritted teeth. ""This could kill someone!""



He squinted, sneering: ""This is just simulating real climbing conditions. You're supposed to be a professional—isn't this reaction a bit dramatic?""



But the next instant, a massive boulder was pushed off, falling directly toward me!



I had no time to dodge, only able to press myself against the rock face. But I was still too slow—



""CRASH!""



The violent impact exploded as the boulder grazed my shoulder, half my body taking a brutal hit, instantly losing balance. My back was scraped open by the rock, searing pain shooting straight to my brain.



My fingers loosened from the impact by half an inch, my body swaying violently, nearly thrown off. The anchor point beneath my feet crumbled at one corner, debris clattering into the deep sea.



The live stream comments exploded:



\*\[Fuck! It actually hit her!\]\*



\*\[This isn't playing around—this is attempted murder!\]\*



The private doctor at the cliff top finally panicked: ""Alexander! Her wound has opened up—this will cause serious problems if it continues!""



Alexander's expression changed too: ""I specifically ordered small rocks—who told you to throw one that big?!""



He spun around, shouting at the bodyguards: ""Are you trying to kill her?!""



The doctor had just pulled out his medical kit to help stop my bleeding when Isabella quickly stepped forward, saying softly: ""Let me help Chloe. I don't want anything to happen to her.""



She took the first aid kit, but her hands trembled slightly. The next second—



""Oops!""



The medical kit slipped from her hands, tracing an arc through the air before crashing heavily against nearby rocks, then rolling off the cliff edge, blown away by the sea wind without a trace.

\## Chapter 4



Isabella stared at the now-calm sea foam, suddenly covering her mouth as tears spilled out: ""I'm sorry, Alexander, I didn't mean to... I was just too anxious.""



Alexander had been scowling, but his expression softened as he looked at her tearful face. He finally sighed, his tone gentling: ""It's okay, I know you were just too worried.""



But I no longer had the strength to listen to their conversation. Consciousness felt layered with black waves, my breathing growing shallower and shallower.



Alexander came down from the cliff at this point, reaching my side.



He cupped my face in both hands, trying to make me open my eyes: ""Chloe, hold on, do you hear me? I'll get you up there.""



I hated his touch, wanting to push him away but lacking the strength.



Seeing his face so close, I felt only coldness.



At this moment, Isabella's voice pierced like a poisoned needle: ""Alexander, no. She hasn't apologized to me yet... I mean, so many people are watching, they've all placed bets. If you just pull her up like this, you're telling the whole world you lost to her.""



Alexander's gaze suddenly darkened as he turned to me: ""Chloe, just apologize to Isabella and this will all be over. I'll pull you up right now.""



I summoned what little strength remained and laughed coldly: ""In your dreams.""



Then I pushed him away with all my might. My weakened body made the movement seem pathetically feeble, yet it concentrated all my will.



Alexander's face instantly went iron-gray. He stood up, ordering coldly: ""Her physical condition isn't suitable for holding out much longer. Hold her down—make her bow and apologize!""



Two bodyguards immediately rappelled down, pressing hard on my shoulders. Sharp rocks dug into my knees, cold pain mercilessly transmitted as they forced me to bend down.



I clenched my teeth, but heard Isabella's feigned panic: ""Be careful!""



The next second, she slammed into me from above, pressing half my face directly against the ice-cold rock wall.



The hard, rough stone tore open my skin, blood flowing down my forehead as the metallic taste spread across my lips.



Suffocation and stabbing pain hit simultaneously. I felt my entire face burning with fire.



Her lowered voice reached my ear: ""From the very beginning, I never planned to let you leave here alive.""



Just as I was about to lose consciousness—



The sky suddenly exploded with a thunderous roar, low and powerful.



A helicopter's rotors whipped up violent winds, sweeping across the entire cliff top and making Isabella stumble backward repeatedly.



A figure rappelled from the helicopter, leaping onto the cliff face with clean, decisive movements, military boots kicking up a ring of stone chips.



Before anyone could react, the black-clad team members behind him poured down like a tide, pushing Isabella roughly downward.



Isabella screamed, nearly falling off the cliff.



The man strode over to me, leaning down to lift me from the rock face.



His chest conveyed steady, powerful heartbeats as he looked down, his gaze sharp as a blade: ""How did you get yourself into such a mess?""",1,1759988838.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1o1y0d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1o1y0d7/echoes/,Echoes,"Vina traced a finger down the soft leather of car seat she was lounging in. She'd met Lance nearly a week ago at an off-campus party, on the last weekend before the end of the semester. She had been drawn by his easy laugh cutting through the thumping bass. He was nearly twenty years older than her, but she'd always had a thing for older men. Daddy issues. They'd spent the rest of the night talking together. Now, less than a week later, she was in his convertible as it purred along the coastal highway, wind whipping her long curly dark hair across her neck and cheeks. He drove one-handed, the other resting casually on her thigh. ""Almost there,"" he promised, flashing that disarming grin. Vina nodded, stomach fluttering, thinking of what they would do when they got to the beach house.

The wooden beach house appeared suddenly around a bend—white clapboard gleaming against scrubby pines. It looked expensive but worn in that effortless way, like Lance's faded polo shirts. He bounded out, grabbing her duffel bag before she could protest. ""My brother's place. He's in Europe all summer."" Vina followed him inside, sneakers squeaking on polished wood floors. Everything felt airy and vast, smelling faintly of lemon polish and brine.

In the kitchen, Lance pulled two beers from a stainless steel fridge. He popped the caps, handing her one. ""So?"" he asked, leaning against the counter. Vina took a small sip, the bitter tang sharp on her tongue. She watched him watch her, his gaze lingering. ""It's perfect,"" she murmured, setting the bottle down carefully. A curl escaped the ponytail she had pulled her hair into, and she tucked it behind her ear. Lance reached out, his thumb brushing her jawline. ""That's good,"" he said softly. Outside, waves crashed against the shore.

He showed her the rest of the house—the sunroom with wicker furniture, the guest bedroom where he dropped her duffel bag. ""This is yours,"" he said, but his hand slid to the small of her back, guiding her toward the master suite instead. The room was dominated by a king-sized bed with crisp white linens. French doors opened onto a private deck overlooking the ocean. Vina's pulse quickened as he pulled her close. ""I want you here,"" he breathed against her temple. She nodded, unable to speak.

That first night, they ate takeout on the deck as the sun bled into the sea. Vina laughed too loudly at his stories, her knee bouncing under the table. When he reached across to wipe sauce from her chin, she froze, then leaned into his touch. They kissed hungrily, the food lay forgotten between them. Later, tangled in his sheets, she traced the scar on his shoulder—a thin white line she hadn’t noticed before. ""Sailing accident,"" he murmured, catching her wrist. ""Don't worry about it."" She pressed closer, inhaling his scent—salt and expensive cologne. The moonlight painted silver stripes across the bed.

Over the next week, Vina learned his routines. She woke early to brew his coffee just how he liked it—strong, with a touch of cream, one brown sugar cube. She did the laundry, memorized when he liked to swim (mid-morning, when the sun was not too high), and noticed how he frowned slightly when his toast wasn’t browned enough. One afternoon, she found an old photo album in a den drawer. Flipping through, she saw younger versions of Lance—hair longer, smile wilder—arm in arm with a woman who looked like her. Same dark eyes, same tilt of the chin. Her throat tightened. She snapped the album shut when footsteps approached.

He took her sailing later that day. The little catamaran sliced through turquoise water, salt stinging their lips. When a gust caught the sail unexpectedly, Vina stumbled. Lance caught her wrist, his grip firm. ""Easy,"" he laughed, but his eyes didn’t join in. She clung to the rail, knuckles white, as he adjusted the ropes with swift, practiced tugs. The boat steadied, but her stomach didn’t. Later, back onshore, she rubbed sunscreen into his shoulders, her fingers lingering on the ridge of that scar. He didn’t flinch, didn’t speak. Just stared out at the horizon where sky met sea.

The next evening, Lance brought home lobsters. Vina watched him plunge them live into boiling water, their frantic claws scraping the pot’s sides. The sound made her flinch. At dinner, she picked at the sweet meat, her fork clinking loudly against the plate in the sudden quiet. ""Something wrong?"" he asked, wiping butter from his chin. She shook her head too fast. ""Just tired."" His gaze sharpened, dissecting her like the lobster shell on his plate. He reached across, brushing her cheekbone with his thumb. ""Don’t lie to me, Vina."" Her pulse hammered against her ribs.

She woke sweating an hour before dawn. Lance slept soundly beside her, one arm flung possessively across her waist. The photo album’s face—her face—haunted the darkness. Silently, she slipped out, padding barefoot to the den. Moonlight spilled through the blinds as she pulled the album out again. Page after page: Lance laughing with the dark-eyed woman on this same deck, her head thrown back in joy. On the last page, a Polaroid fluttered loose. Scrawled on the back in faded blue ink: *Elena, Capri ‘99*. Vina traced the letters. The resemblance was terrifying.

In the morning, Vina burned the french toast she was making. She was staring at the ocean distracted as smoke curled from the pan. Lance strode into the kitchen, shirtless, frowning at the charred mess. ""Christ, Vina,"" he snapped, snatching the pan. She mumbled apologies, hands trembling as she watched him scrape the black mess into the bin. He gripped her shoulder, spinning her around. His eyes weren’t angry—they were hungry, searching. ""Look at me,"" he commanded. She lifted her gaze to his, seeing Elena reflected there. His thumb pressed against her lower lip. ""Better clean this up,"" he murmured, but didn’t move. Outside, the ocean roared.

He backed her against the fridge, its cold steel biting through her thin tank top. His kiss tasted like coffee and impatience. When he pulled away, his fingers tangled in her hair, tilting her head back. ""Bedrooom,"" he murmured, his voice rough with lust. She followed wordlessly, bare feet silent on polished oak. Sunlight slashed through the blinds, painting stripes across the rumpled sheets where she’d lain sleepless this morning. Lance closed the door behind them. The click echoed.

His hands weren’t gentle. They mapped her body like territory—claiming the dip of her waist, the curve of her hip, the frantic pulse at her throat. When his teeth grazed her collarbone, she gasped. ""Don't speak,"" he breathed against her skin. She obeyed, biting her lip until copper bloomed on her tongue. He pushed her onto the bed, peeling away clothes with methodical precision. His gaze never left her face, studying her reactions like equations to solve. She shut her eyes against it, but he gripped her chin. ""Look at me."" His pupils swallowed the brown of his irises.

He worked her body like an instrument tuned to his touch. Fingers traced the sensitive hollow behind her neck, the soft skin inside her elbow, the circle under her breast. Each touch built pressure—a slow, relentless tide. She arched into him, seeking friction, but he withheld it. His thumb circled her nipple, feather-light, until she whimpered. ""Patience,"" he murmured. His mouth followed the path his hands had charted—hot, wet kisses along her ribs, the sharp edge of her hipbone, the trembling plane of her stomach. He lingered there, breath ghosting over skin already slick with sweat. She tangled her hands in his hair, pulling. He chuckled, low and dark. ""Not yet.""

When his mouth finally found her core, she cried out—a raw, broken sound swallowed by the pillow. He pinned her hips down, relentless. The rhythm was practiced, exacting. Waves of sensation crashed over her—the scrape of stubble, the slick heat of his tongue, the suction that drew her deeper. She gasped, fingers scrabbling against the sheets. He knew exactly when to ease off, when to push harder, dragging her toward the edge only to pull back. Tears pricked her eyes. ""Please,"" she choked out. He lifted his head, eyes gleaming. ""Please what?"" She couldn’t say it. Couldn’t give him that word. He smiled then—cold, triumphant—and drove her over with the brutal press of his finger inside her.

Afterward, she lay trembling, skin humming.

Lance rolled away, sweat cooling on his spine. Vina watched the ceiling fan slice the silence. Her throat felt raw. She turned her head on the pillow. ""Tell me what you want"" she whispered. His eyes were closed. ""I'll do anything for you."" Her hand crept across the sheet to touch his arm. ""Anything.""

He opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling. ""Why?""

""Because I want to make you happy."" The words felt hollow. She pushed up on one elbow, hair falling across his chest. ""Your fantasies. Anything."" She traced the scar on his shoulder—a habit now. ""Just name it.""

His fingers closed around her wrist, not gently. ""Careful what you offer."" Finally, he looked at her. That assessing gaze again, like she was a puzzle missing pieces. ""There's a cove,"" he said slowly. ""West of here. Rocky. Private."" His thumb rubbed circles on her pulse point. ""I want you there. At sunset. Naked on the rocks like a mermaid.""

Vina's breath hitched. ""Okay.""

""Just you. And the sea."" His voice dropped lower. ""And me watching from the cliff path.""

She imagined the chill of stone against bare skin, the gulls crying overhead. ""Yes.""

""Thank you."" He released her wrist, sat up. The sheet pooled around his waist. Sunlight caught the silver in his stubble. ""Now, coffee.""

Vina scrambled up, legs unsteady. She pulled on his discarded shirt—it smelled like him, salt and dominance—and padded to the kitchen. Her hands shook as she measured the grounds. *Elena*, she thought. *Did he take her to the cove too?*

Behind her, Lance’s voice cut through the grinder’s whir. ""Don't over-think it."" He stood in the doorway, lean and predatory. ""The fantasy only works if you want it.""

She poured steaming water into the French press. ""I want it.""

He crossed the tiles in three strides, and lifted his hand to touch her cheek. ""At sunset. No hesitations. No flinching. Do whatever I ask."" His eyes bored into hers. ""Be perfect.""

Vina held his gaze. ""I will be."" The french press trembled in her hands.

He studied her face—the dark eyes, the stubborn set of her jaw—and something flickered in his expression. Hunger? Regret? It vanished before she could name it. He took the coffee from her hands, his fingers brushing hers. ""I'll see you there.""

Outside, the ocean roared, relentless. Vina walked out and watched him walk away, shirtless, towards his boat. The old dock groaned under shifting tides, its weathered planks slick with salt spray. Vina traced a splintered crack on the deck with her bare toe, wondering how many storms it had survived. She thought of sharp rocks. Cold water. And how badly she wanted to be perfect for him.

The day crawled. She scrubbed the charred pan until her knuckles burned, polished the already gleaming counters, folded laundry that didn’t need folding. Every clock ticked louder. At five o'clock, she stood before the bedroom mirror wearing nothing but Lance’s shirt. Her reflection stared back—dark eyes wide, lips bitten raw. *Elena’s eyes*, she thought. She unbuttoned the shirt slowly, letting it pool at her feet. The air felt colder without it.

Sunset bled across the horizon when she found the cove—a jagged slash of rock west of the house, hidden behind wind-stunted pines. The path down was treacherous, sharp stones biting into her soles. Salt stung her scraped feet. She climbed onto the highest flat rock, the granite rough and cold beneath her knees. Waves crashed below, spraying her skin. Goosebumps rose. She didn’t flinch.

Above, on the cliff path, a shadow moved. Lance. He stood perfectly still, backlit by the dying sun. Vina could feel his gaze like a physical touch—scraping over her shoulders, down her spine, settling on the curve of her hip. She kept her eyes on the horizon, where the sea swallowed the last sliver of light. A purple bruise spread across the sky.

""Spread your legs,"" his voice cut through the wind, cold and clear. Not loud. Not gentle. Commanding. Vina obeyed. The rock bit into her thighs. She heard gravel shift as he descended the path, slow, deliberate. Closer. Closer. His footsteps stopped behind her. She felt his breath on her neck. ""Elena,"" he murmured. One hand reached under her neck. The other under her back. With a swift move, he lifted her up and carried her on to the sand.

He laid her down on the soft sand. His fingers traced the line of her jaw. ""Look at me."" She lifted her eyes. In the twilight, his face was all shadow and hunger. ""You're trembling."" He wasn't asking. His thumb gently pressed against her lower lip. ""Cold?"" She shook her head. ""Good."" He leaned down. His mouth covered hers. The kiss was warm, but firm and possessive.

The kiss deepened. Salt and desperation mingled on their tongues. His hands mapped her body—the curve of her hip, the dip of her waist, the swell of her breasts. He didn't rush. Each touch was deliberate. Claiming. Vina arched into him, sand gritting beneath her skin. ""Say my name,"" he demanded against her mouth. ""Lance,"" she breathed. He rewarded her with teeth on her collarbone, a sharp sting that bloomed into warmth. ""Again."" She obeyed. His hands slid lower, fingers finding her slick heat. She gasped, her cry lost to the crashing waves. ""Perfect,"" he murmured.

He entered her slowly. The sand shifted beneath them as he moved. His eyes never left hers, watching every flicker of sensation. She wrapped her legs around his waist, pulling him deeper. Each thrust was measured, controlled. A rhythm as old as the sea itself. Her nails dug into his back, drawing beads of blood. He groaned, low and approving. The tide crept closer, wetting their ankles. Still, he didn't hurry. He built the pressure like a storm gathering offshore—relentless, inevitable. When she shattered, it was silent. A gasp caught in her throat. He followed, his release shuddering through them both as the first stars pierced the bruised sky.

Afterward, they lay huddled in a shallow cave out of the wind. He traced the sand-coated sweat-slicked line of her spine. Vina lay rigid, feeling the sand beneath her, listening to his breathing. The Polaroid burned in her mind—Elena’s laugh frozen in time, Lance’s arm around her waist on a sun-drenched Capri dock. ""Who was she?"" The question slipped out, thin as sea mist. Lance’s hand stilled. Silence stretched, thick with the scent of salt and sex. Waves crashed and gulls screamed into the silence. Finally, he rolled on his back and stared at the sky. ""Dead,"" he said flatly. He stood up and pulled on his jeans. The zipper’s rasp sounded like a knife being drawn. He walked away without looking back. Vina curled into the hollow his body left behind, cold creeping through her bones.

Later, she found him on the deck, nursing a whiskey. His knuckles were white around the glass. Vina hovered in the doorway, wearing Elena’s silk robe she’d discovered in the closet. Lance’s gaze locked on her. ""Take it off."" His voice was low, pained. She untied the sash slowly. The silk whispered to the floor. He didn’t blink. ""Come closer."" She stepped out onto the deck. His hand reached for her hungrily.

He pulled her onto his lap, the wicker chair groaning. His fingers dug into her hips as he kissed her—hard, demanding, tasting of whiskey and regret. She wrapped her arms around his neck, pressing against him. The ocean roared below, matching the frantic rhythm of her pulse. He broke the kiss, breathing ragged. ""Why are you here?"" he rasped, forehead pressed to hers. She didn’t answer. Instead, she slid down onto her knees before him, her hands trembling as she unbuckled his belt. His eyes darkened, watching her every move.

She took him into her mouth. He groaned, fingers tangling in her hair, guiding her pace. Salt air mingled with the musk of desire. Waves crashed against the pilings below, shaking the deck beneath her knees. He pulled her up roughly, lifting her onto the wide arm of the chair. His mouth found her breast, teeth grazing her nipple as his fingers slid between her thighs. She gasped, arching into him. ""Look at me,"" he commanded. Her eyes met his—dark pools reflecting the moon’s silver path on the water. He entered her slowly, deliberately, filling the aching hollow inside her.

They moved together, the chair rocking against the weathered boards. His thrusts were deep, possessive, each one chasing the ghost of Elena from the space between them. Vina clung to him, nails scoring his back as the tension coiled tighter. When release came, it was silent—a shared shudder that left them breathless, tangled in the humid night. Lance buried his face in her neck, his breathing ragged against her skin. ""Stay, don't go,"" he murmured, almost a plea. They stayed silent, thinking their own thoughts, their breathing and waves crashing below the only sounds in the house.

Without warning, he scooped her up. Vina gasped, arms looping around his neck as he carried her through the French doors, past the rumpled bed, and into the dim hallway. He didn’t stop until they reached the den—the room where she’d found the album. Setting her down on the leather sofa, he knelt before her, his expression stripped bare in the moonlight. ""Elena,"" he said, the name raw. ""She was my wife.""

He reached for a decanter on the sideboard, poured two fingers of amber liquid, and drank it neat. The glass trembled slightly in his hand. ""We wanted a child."" His gaze fixed on the shadows beyond the window. ""She miscarried at five months. A boy."" The words fell like stones. ""Afterward... she wasn’t the same. Hollow. Angry at the world. At me.""

Lance’s knuckles whitened around the glass. ""I brought her here. To heal."" A bitter laugh escaped him. ""The last time... I found her naked on those same rocks in the cove. At sunset, like you tonight."" His voice thickened. ""We made love there. Fierce, like drowning people."" He looked at Vina, really looked at her, his eyes haunted. ""She vanished the next morning. Left a note saying she needed to be away from me. A couple of days later..."" He trailed off, the pause heavier than the words had been. The silence stretched between them. ""They found her body washed up on a beach some miles away."" He finally whispered. ""She had overdosed on sleeping pills and gone into the ocean.""

Vina reached out, her fingers brushing his scarred shoulder. He flinched. ""This?"" His thumb traced the thin white line. ""Not sailing. She threw a crystal decanter. A few nights before... before the cove."" He caught her hand, pressing her palm flat against the old wound. ""You look so much like her. Especially in moonlight. It’s... cruel."" His voice broke. ""And I can’t stop.""

He knelt fully then, not in prayer but surrender—forehead pressed to her knee, shoulders shaking. ""I told her I loved her that last night. On those rocks. She laughed."" The memory tore through him like glass. ""Said love was saltwater—stings the wound but never heals it."" His fingers dug into Vina’s thighs. ""I loved her enough to let her destroy us both.""

Silence pooled around them, thick with the scent of spilled whiskey and regret. Outside, the tide hissed against the shore. Vina slid down to the floor beside him, her robe pooling like forgotten wings. She touched his jaw, rough with stubble and tears. ""Look at me."" His eyes lifted—drowned, desperate. ""I’m not her.""

Lance flinched. ""I know.""

""Do you?"" Her thumb traced the scar on his shoulder. ""Elena chose saltwater. I choose you."" The words hung between them, fragile as sea foam. He stared at her, really stared—past the dark eyes and bitten lips, past the ghost of his wife. For the first time, he saw *her*. Vina. Not an echo. Not a cure. Just a girl trembling on the edge of his broken world.

His hand shot out, gripping her wrist. Not possessively. Not cruelly. Like a lifeline. ""Stay,"" he rasped. Not a command. A plea. ""Stay with me."" She nodded, her hair catching moonlight as she leaned into him. They didn’t speak. Didn’t move. Just breathed—he inhaled against her temple, breathing in her scent.  Her quiet breath warmed his collarbone.

Hours later, Vina woke to emptiness. Lance’s side of the bed was cold. She found him on the deck, shirtless, staring at the bruised horizon where dawn bled purple and gold. He didn’t turn as she approached. ""I dreamt of her,"" he said, voice raw. ""On the rocks. Laughing."" Vina wrapped her arms around his waist from behind, pressing her cheek to the ridge of his spine. He shuddered. ""She said you’d leave too.""

Vina tightened her hold. ""Tell me what to do.""

""Live,"" he whispered.

The word hung between them—small, impossible, terrifying.  She kissed the scar on his shoulder.  A promise.  A beginning.

The gulls screamed overhead, but the ocean’s roar felt softer now, less like a threat, more like a heartbeat.

 

*Coda*

Summer was ending. Vina sat on the same flat rock near sunset, but she now wore Lance’s old Yale sweatshirt over her jeans. The cove felt smaller now. Below, the tide swirled on the beach where they had made love. She’d lost count of how many times she had come here alone. Lance never asked.

Inside the beach house, dust motes danced in the late afternoon light. Vina traced the spine of Elena’s photo album still on the den shelf—sitting there since that whiskey-soaked confession. She’d memorized every curve of Elena’s smile, every crinkle around Lance’s younger eyes. Her own reflection in the glass pane over Elena’s Capri Polaroid showed sharper cheekbones now, shadows under her eyes.

Lance found her there. ""Still haunting you? Or are you haunting her?"" His voice was softer than it used to be, but the edge remained. He held out an itinerary. ""Naples. The flight leaves next week.""

Vina froze. Capri’s blue waters glowed from the Polaroid beneath her fingertips. ""Why?""

""To bury ghosts."" He didn’t touch her. ""Or recall them. Your choice.""

The plane shuddered through turbulence over the Atlantic. Lance slept fitfully, his hand clenched around hers. Vina watched his profile—the scar, the tension in his jaw even in sleep. She wondered if he dreamt of crystal decanters shattering.

Capri smelled of lemons and salt. At the harbor, Lance pointed to a crumbling stone dock. ""That’s where we took the photo."" His knuckles brushed her wrist. ""She loved figs. Would steal them from that grove up there."" He pointed to terraced hills lush with green.

They rented a scooter. Vina clung to Lance’s waist as they careened up narrow roads, cliffs dropping away to turquoise nothingness. Wind whipped Elena’s old silk scarf from Vina’s neck. Lance didn’t stop to retrieve it.

At sunset, they stood where the Polaroid was taken. Lance pulled a small velvet box from his pocket. Inside lay Elena’s emerald ring—the one from the album photos. ""She left it on the nightstand,"" he said. The gem caught the dying light like frozen seawater. ""I want you to have it.""

Vina didn’t move. ""I’m not her replacement.""

""I know."" He took her hand. The ring was cold. ""You’re the one who stayed.""

Below, waves slammed against rocks. Elena’s laughter seemed to ride the wind. Vina slid the ring onto her finger. It fit perfectly.

Lance exhaled—a sound like a chain breaking. ""Let’s go home.""

On the ferry back, Vina threw the ring into the wake. It vanished instantly. Lance didn’t flinch. He just pulled her closer, his chin resting on her hair as Capri dissolved into twilight.",1,1759988625.0,shortstory,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

After a lifetime of journaling, a lot of late nights, rewrites, second-guessing, and more coffee than I’ll admit, my book *Resonance of the Aligned Self* is finally out on Amazon.

Feels strange seeing it out there now — kind of like handing over a journal.

It started as me just trying to make sense of my own life — figuring out why life looked right on the outside but didn’t feel right on the inside.

Honestly, I wasn’t sure I’d ever share it publicly. Writing has always been more therapy than plan for me.

If even one person reads it and feels a little less alone in their own “figuring it out,” that’s enough for me.

Writing this book taught me more than I expected — mostly that honesty hits harder than perfection ever will.

If it sounds like something that might resonate, here’s the link:

👉 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FT91J4YZ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FT91J4YZ)

I really appreciate everyone taking a minute to read this.  
I’d love to hear what stood out to you.

Here's What I Learned (and Why You Might Need It),"I've been lurking here for inspiration while grinding on my first solo SaaS launch. After 2 months of late nights (and way too much coffee), I finally shipped CreatorBowl - an all-in-one platform designed to supercharge creators and pros who juggle links, content, and growth.

**Quick backstory:** I started as a side hustle frustration - why do creators need 5+ tools for bio links, smart redirects, AI ideas, and analytics? So I built this to consolidate it all. Validated early with 20 beta users who gave thumbs up on the AI features.

**Core Features:**

* **Link-in-Bio 2.0:** BentoBowl (modular grids) or ClassicBowl styles, fully customizable + built-in lead magnets to capture emails on the spot.
* **Smart Links:** Unlimited links that open natively in apps (bye, in-app browser hell), with customizable previews, real-time click tracking, and source breakdowns.
* **Shiro AI Assistant:** Generates post/content ideas, scripts, and even edits images - like having a creative co-pilot.
* **Analytics Dashboard:** Views, clicks, countries, sources - all in one clean view to spot what's working.

Live now at [https://creatorbowl.com](https://creatorbowl.com) \- Claim your free trial to start, pro plus unlocks unlimited everything.

What do you think? For SaaS folks: How would you price this? Any must-have features I'm missing? Creators: Would this save you time? Feedback = gold.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1o1xy3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1o1xy3c/backups_because_your_brain_deserves_a_safety_net/,Backups: Because Your Brain Deserves a Safety Net,"
>This is targeting non-technical people, with the goal of creating the conscience that backups are important.

Let's get one thing straight: if it's important to you, it's critical. Period.

Whether it's your Obsidian vault full of daily reflections, your grandma's mole recipe, or that half-finished novel you swear you'll finish someday: if losing it would make you scream, cry, or spiral into existential dread, then it's critical data. And critical data needs backups.

### ""But I'm not technical…""

Perfect. That's exactly why you need backups. Tech-savvy folks lose data too, but they usually have a plan. If you're not technical, you're flying without a parachute. And Obsidian users? You're building a second brain. Why would you risk lobotomizing it?

### Real Talk: What Could Go Wrong?

- Your laptop dies. No warning. Just *poof*.
- You accidentally delete your vault. (Yes, it happens. With some people, more than once…)
- Sync goes sideways and overwrites your notes.
- Ransomware. Theft. Coffee spills. Cosmic irony.

Backups are your insurance against all of that. They're boring until they're heroic.

### A Story You Don't Want to Be

I know someone who lost three years of personal journaling because their hard drive died. No backup. They cried. I cried. It was devastating.

Those notes? Irreplaceable. Gone forever. No ""download again"" button. No recovery service could save them.

Don't be that person.

### So What Counts as a Backup?

A backup is a **copy** of your data that lives **somewhere else**. Not the same folder. Not the same drive. Not the same planet, ideally. Ok… it can be on the same planet, but in a different location.

Here's a simple setup:
- **Local copy**: External hard drive or USB stick.
- **Cloud copy**: Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, Obsidian Sync (whatever you trust).
- **Versioned copy**: Something that keeps old versions (like Git or Obsidian Sync with version history).

Bonus points if you automate it. Double bonus if you test it once in a while.

### ""But I'll Do It Later…""

No. Now.

Backups are boring *until you need them*. And when you need them, it's already too late. This is literally 10 minutes that could save years of work.

You wouldn't skip car insurance because it's ""inconvenient to set up,"" would you?

### Obsidian Users: We're Especially Vulnerable

You're crafting knowledge. Ideas. Memories. Stuff that doesn't exist anywhere else. If your vault vanishes, there's no ""download again"" button. It's gone.

So treat your vault like your brain: protect it, back it up, and don't assume tomorrow will be kind.

### Test Your Backups (Yes, Really)

Here's the uncomfortable truth: an untested backup is like a fire extinguisher you've never checked. It might work. It might not. You want to find out during the fire?

Once a month, try restoring a random file from your backup. If it works, great. If it doesn't, you just discovered a problem while there's still time to fix it.

### Start Now (Seriously, Takes 5 Minutes)

Stop reading. Start doing.

1. **Today**: Copy your vault to an external drive or USB stick
2. **This week**: Set up cloud sync (Obsidian Sync, Dropbox, Google Drive, whatever)
3. **This month**: Test restoring a file from your backup
4. **Every month**: Verify your backups are still working

That's it. Four steps between you and peace of mind.

## Final Thought

Backups aren't just for tech nerds. They're for anyone who cares about their stuff. And if you're using Obsidian, you care deeply.

So back it up. Test it. Your future self will thank you.

And if you don't? Well, I really hope you never need to learn this lesson the hard way..

Absolute game changer.,"As someone who has tried Kratom and kava before with limited success in hopes of remedying their alcoholism for the last couple years, I was curious about 7OH. I’ve heard things about it ranging from “it’s just a stupid millennial hipster plant medicine fad”, to “that shit is literally as addictive as heroin and will cause horrendous withdrawals”, and everything in between.

My experience with Kratom in the past has been mixed, as there was a fine line between feeling almost nothing on it, to getting really sick and nauseous if I took slightly too much. On top of that, the shit was a pain in the ass to gulp down and the powder was messy. Kava was also similar, but neither could really scratch that itch like booze could.

So I decided to try out 7OH for myself since I was deeply craving alcohol and can’t have any in my current living situation. I purchased a pack of six 10mg tablets for $30 and took half of it like the package recommends, and then the other half a couple of hours later.

The closest thing I can compare the high to is the bottle of Kratom extract shots, but better and lasts longer. It feels really pleasant, like a strong cup of coffee without the jitteriness. With a higher dosage, I got an overall sense of relief and comfort, not quite like the warm blanket of alcohol, but noticeably more relaxed and at peace. I found myself not craving alcohol simultaneously as well and completely satisfied. 10/10 would recommend and it’s the closest thing to being high without being negatively impaired.

I can’t believe I waited this long to try it and I don’t see myself needing a drink as long as I have access to this stuff. I’ve heard stories about people making multiple trips a day to the smoke shop hopelessly addicted to the stuff, but less is really more with 7OH honestly. I can actually tell my limit with it, unlike booze.",1,1759987593.0,Crippled_Alcoholics,3,1.0,False

Here's my 10-day itinerary, started off in Osaka and ended up in Tokyo. I knew it was going to be very humid and hot, so I didn't even bother doing any trains except the Shinkansen from Shin-Osaka to Tokyo. 

IMO Taxis to me were cheap and I learned how to hail it by watching others lol. I enjoyed Osaka a lot, taking the hop on hop off tour gave me an overview of the city in a short amount of time. I just wanted to be out and about and did not really spend much time indoors or standing in line for restaurants with viral foods/desserts etc...

For Tokyo, I split up the 5 days - 2 nights Akihabara and 3 nights Shinjuku, I think that was enough for me to see the city. I had some sinus headaches so didn't have time to see Ginza, Ueno, Ikebukuro etc... I came for the shopping and just taking it easy.

I booked my AA flight with airline miles, round trip from LAX to HND and it included the JAL flight to Osaka ITM (one way).

**Sept. 15 Monday** \- Flight lands Tokyo HND 4:45 AM, pacing ourselves, not knowing what to expect- loved the long walkways/people mover and my first contact with bidet toilets lol

Go through customs with visit Japan online app - this part had me stumped and I couldn't figure out how to get the QR code until an agent assisted me. 

Waited for luggage at the baggage claim. 

Lots of people arrived in the customs room but I think it took under 10 minutes to scan passports and do the face recognition. Not as intimidating as I thought. Staff spoke English, really easy to understand directions from them. 

After I went through customs, I had to go through another kiosk to scan my passport again for declarations. Answered the questions and went through another line.

Went to JAL desk (past customs and declaration stations) to check bags for the flight to Osaka.

Took free shuttle bus to terminal 1 at 6:30 AM for JAL 107 flight 8:20 am - one hour flight to Osaka ITM Airport 

Go through security again with carryon bags. Looked around, purchased coffee and water from vending machine, purchased gifts from gift shops, watched planes come and go and the workers bowing to planes departing. Note to self- buy whatever I see catches my eye! I saw some really cute, small and inexpensive gifts here and didn't get them and I regret not seeing it again when I flew out of HND.

Arrive 9:30 am Osaka ITM Airport 

Waited a while for the luggage to come out, they have staff that handle the luggage with care! Wow I've never seen that before

Gather luggage and search for taxi stand pickup

Taxi to The OneFive Namba Dotonbori hotel 

Lunch at Kobe Beef Ramen Roku no Miya across from The OneFive Dotonbori hotel- super cheap! 

Relax and sleep due to traveling all day! We had been up for 24 hours and did our best to match the time zone for minimal jetlag.

**Sept. 16** **Tuesday** \- 7-11 next door to hotel for iced coffee, Yakult for digestion, smoothie, egg salad sandwich....shopping and walking around Dotonbori street to look around and buy souvenirs

Located the JR Post office near the hotel to ship out souvenirs to USA- took me one hour to input everything and made sure the box was under $100 value - note to self, next time save receipts and attach to whatever I'm shipping out in the box, take pictures and have it sent to workplace not home.

Note to self, cannot mail out clothes, only gifts! 

Osaka hop on and hop off bus tour at 1:30 pm in front of b-namba kuromon hotel and across from Kuromon market 

Hop on-hop off bus tour ended at 6 pm at the taxi stand near the Kobe Beef restaurant

Loved the deer of course but did not pet them because I didn't want to get in contact with any ticks lol...cash only for extra crackers to feed the deer

So many people here! Impossible to see anything but glad I was able to walk around a bit just to see the Grand Ring at sunset, Osaka bay, watched some water shows and dancers and singers. The front area near the entrance was very dark when the sun went down, not much lighting at all. Gift shops had a nice selection of stuff. Lines everywhere to wait for food! Glad I bought some water and Pocari sweat.

Uber back to hotel (approx $30 each way) wow the area to pick up the Uber was probably about a mile away - opposite direction from taxi and shuttle bus pick up. I walked forever but there were staff along the way to guide me in the right direction. Uber driver kept messaging me and was polite about staying. Note to self, don't call Uber until getting to the actual pick up spot. They were very efficient here and they asked me the driver's name. They used a megaphone to call him and rightaway he came to us. That was great!

I don't remember if I ate dinner- maybe just conbini snacks. I ate here and there but we did so much sightseeing it was mostly snacks and drinks.

**Sep.t 19 Friday** \- cruise around Dotonbori; taxi to Shin-Osaka station ($30) to take the Hello Kitty Shinkansen train (Kodama 849) to Hiroshima. Booked tickets through Klook and went to the Information Center to redeem the bookings and received actual tickets to scan through the machine. Process was so easy and quick. I found the station to be easy to navigate, I did not seem overwhelmed or intimidated by it. Didn't buy bentos, bought snacks, onigiri and beer.

Exit Hiroshima station - wow this place is huge and can be intimidating. Visitor center here was super helpful!

Explored Hiroshima with heavy feelings and reflection. Will definitely spend more time here next time.

Back to the Hiroshima train station and took the Nozomi train (minimal stops) back to Shin-Osaka station then to hotel (taxi $30) 

Taxi back to the hotel, stroll Dotonbori for dinner - Wagyu meats, chicken and crab on a stick, drinks, didn't really feel like I wanted a full meal tonight.

Memory smells of Dotonbori - oil, fried foods! lol not a bad thing but I guess the Takoyaki is the main street meal here. I'm not a fan of octopus so I didn't try this. I stuck to sushi and meats instead.

Checked out street performers and people watching near the river.

Found the Taxi stand outside the Shibuya Scramble building and went back to the hotel

Had apps and drinks on the patio at the APA Kabukicho Chuo Lotus cafe restaurant - best spot for people watching without it being too loud or crazy. This restaurant is my best kept secret and so underrated.

**Sept. 24 Thursday** morning- wandered around Shinjuku neighborhoods on a street/alley with Korean restaurants and makeup - Dasique and Lilybyred- so underrated!

Checked out Don Quijote, Family Mart, interesting art mural in the alleys

Checked out of hotel, had lunch at Lotus cafe

Ordered Uber van to Haneda Airport to make sure we had enough room to haul all of our luggage lol - All the drivers were very professional and even spoke some English when I tried to speak Japanese.

Checked in luggage, checked out shops in Terminal 3 -pre-security

Checked out observation deck, wow all the plane spotters with their fancy cameras lol

Note to self- next time arrive early, grab a luggage cart, stroll around the observation deck, get some food, eat outside on the deck and spend as much time pre-security to explore then check in luggage at least 2 hours before the flight. 

Went through customs and security checkpoint but found out nowhere to eat at our gate 135 so we went back upstairs to eat pizza, drinks, and last-minute souvenir shopping. 

FYI, if you're ever at gate 135, just know you'll board an Airport limousine bus to get to the plane that is in an remote area on the tarmac. You'll take some stairs to board the plane. 

Note to self - aisle seats for long-haul flights! Easy access to bathrooms, enough said.

**Sept. 24 Thursday landed at LAX!**

Next time I would like to explore Nagano, Yokohama and Hokkaido. I think I'll definitely explore more shrines and temples next time. I really enjoyed just being outdoors, people watching and being in the crowds in Osaka and Tokyo. I will try exploring and riding the subways but I don't want to get on during AM and PM rush hour times. ",0,1759987515.0,JapanTravelTips,2,0.5,False

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

1o1xmy9,https://i.redd.it/b0mapcrlt0uf1.png,💌 A Story from Siargao – Liz’s Secret 💗,"From Liz (not her real name):

>I came to Siargao last year after ending a long relationship. I wasn’t looking for anyone - just peace. Mornings at the market, coffee by the beach, learning to be alone again. Life was slow, quiet, healing... until I met him.

>He was Israeli - polite, funny, calm. He had this gentle way of talking that made people listen. He treated everyone kindly - the waiters, the tricycle drivers, even the kids selling bracelets by the roadside. He didn’t fit the stories I’d heard from locals who said some foreigners act arrogant or treat Filipinos like help.

>We met often - coffee dates, dinner by the shore, long drives around the island. One night, after dinner, we sat by the beach for hours. The stars were out, and the waves sounded like they were whispering our names. We talked about family, about how both of us were running away from something. It was simple, it was real, and for the first time in a long time... I let my guard down.

>A month later, I met his friends. That night changed everything. We had dinner at Isla Cusina - the lights were warm, the music soft, but the energy felt wrong. His friends were loud, dismissive, and treated the restaurant staff like they didn’t exist. And him - he became one of them. He laughed at the jokes he once called rude; he interrupted me mid-sentence; he acted like I was just another girl in his island story. I sat there smiling, pretending I was fine, but my heart was quietly breaking.

>Two months later, I found out I was pregnant. The timing was cruel - I had already stopped seeing him two weeks before. I couldn’t accept who he was when his friends were around, or how easily he forgot the person he made me believe he was.

>Now I don’t know what to do. Should I tell him, or keep quiet and raise this child alone? I’m angry, hurt, and scared. I fell for the person he was at first - not for the man he turned into.

Liz asked me to share this because she doesn’t want sympathy; she just wants to know what others would do in her place. Would you tell him, or walk away completely?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1o1xjwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/atc2/comments/1o1xjwy/memo_from_the_yacht/,Memo from the Yacht,"Okay, my bad. I ran on hopes and dreams and told you all I was bringing more money into your pockets. Guess I should have mentioned the small print, but hey, who reads that anyways. Oh wait, your job is literally based on a HUGE book with a bunch of rules in it(non ATC just google 7110.65). I talked so much trash about Rich extending too, well I voted in agreement with him at first, and then was called out on agreeing with him, so then I said I was tricked, and then I got elected and extended. That was a wild ride. Anyways, I’m on a boat somewhere avoiding accountability. Oh yeah, I said I was going to be transparent too. Honestly, I am an open door. Once I’ve decided what I’m going to do, I’ll let you know about it, and probably after I’ve already done it. Now here’s my favorite part. I love seeing my people get dragged. DEI hires. I didn’t say anything. Them saying your salary is great. I smiled. Starting salary of 180k and could be as high as 400k said to X. That sounds great. Worst day of our profession at DCA. I just wanted to leave that alone. When that WiFi went down I was so happy(see, equipment is important). Todd Yeary gave a great interview for it. Best part about that is he did a better job representing the great work you all do better than every paid natca spokesperson on the news has done in at least the past ten years. So continue complaining on atc2. I don’t care about your opinions because I disagree with them. I’m waiting for the perfect opportunity though. Trust me. It’s coming. I don’t know when. But maybe it’s coming. But in the meantime, I did get you that training pay incentive. Make sure you keep working. I know congress isn’t, but hold your self to a higher standard. We’re the ones working 6 days a week. I’d love to show them an extended final. An engine loss. A bird strike. Laser strikes. 3 general aviation pilots calling up on three different frequencies while you are needing to climb a Southwest. PTAC. Wake turbulence rules. Sudden thunderstorms. Emergency aircraft having to get down fast because of medical conditions on board. An unruly passenger making an airplane go back to the gate, but they were already out at the runway and its gonna be a fun puzzle to figure out how to get them back. Flow times hahaha. I’d love to show them flow times. Giving an aircraft a clearance and hearing they went down later. Hypoxia. Missing your kids events because your regular days off are either a Tuesday or a Wednesday. Telling your daughter you’re working Santa tonight as you leave for work. Eating a thanksgiving dinner with your coworkers, well, you’re on break by yourself but the meal is all out in the breakroom. July fourth up in a tower is pretty cool though. Scheduling leave a year in advance. Benefits. We used to have familiarization flights to help us understand pilots better. Not anymore. Get asked all the time are flights cheap for us. Hahahaha. A lot of us are prior military. Ive worked with every branch….minus space force. We have weird senses of humor, probably because we orchestrate chaos at work. I love giving tours to people because our job seems so normal, to us, but to them it’s amazing. It may seem routine, but on a shift I wonder how many tons of metal has been dependent on me in the sky. I once had a trainee do something stupid that I had to correct in the tower. You know what I did. I drove him to the terminal and we went and had a coffee. Nothing like a latte to remind them that those aren’t just blips on the screens or specks out the window. They’re such a good controller now too. We aren’t being paid but the planes keep moving. Maybe this is our time to sit back and enjoy a cup of whatever our heart desires. Were in the trenches, that’s our skill and we take damn good pride in it. So even if that paycheck doesn’t come, just know nobody does what we do, we’ve earned this swagger. Anyways, politicians do all their bickering, we’re the ones who can actually shut the country down. So here’s to us, the ones who make the job look easy, the ones who show up when it matters, the ones who turn coffees at airport terminals into lessons, and the ones whose value nobody can ever erase.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

# Act 1: The Dream

I'm having coffee with Sarah when I notice her cup.

It's the same blue ceramic mug from yesterday. The chip on the rim sits at exactly two o'clock. Yesterday it was at two o'clock. The day before it was at two o'clock. I'm certain of this in a way I can't explain, the kind of certainty that comes from nowhere and demands attention.

She's telling me about her weekend. The farmers market. The dog that knocked over the apple cart. The vendor who gave her a free bag to apologize. I've heard this before. These exact words in this exact order, with the same laugh in the same places.

I set down my own mug. The coffee inside has gone cold, but I don't remember drinking any of it.

""You okay?"" Sarah asks.

""Yeah, just... have you told me this before?""

""Told you what?""

""The market story. The apples.""

She frowns, and the expression looks rehearsed. ""I don't think so. It just happened on Saturday.""

Saturday. Today is Tuesday. I'm sure of that. Or I was sure of it a moment ago. Now the certainty feels slippery, like trying to hold water in my fist.

The coffee shop around us continues its routine. The espresso machine hisses. Someone's laptop plays music with the volume too high. The door chimes every few minutes as people come and go. Everything normal. Everything exactly as it should be.

Except Sarah's mug is still at two o'clock, and I'm starting to remember other things that repeat. The man in the corner who orders a cappuccino and sits in the same spot every day. The same chair. The same table. He opens the same newspaper to the same page.

I look at him now. He's doing it again. Folding the paper with precise movements. Reaching for his cup. Taking a sip. Setting it down in the exact circular water stain it left yesterday.

""I need to go,"" I tell Sarah.

""Already? But you just got here.""

Did I? I don't remember arriving. The memory should be there, fresh and immediate. Walking through the door. Ordering. Sitting down. Nothing. Just this conversation, looping in the middle of itself.

I stand up, and the chair scrapes against the floor with a sound like tearing fabric. Sarah looks up at me with concern, and I see it now. The way her expressions cycle through the same three variations. Neutral. Concerned. Smiling. Back to neutral. A pattern playing on repeat.

Outside, the street runs parallel to my apartment building. I know this. I've walked this route a thousand times. The bodega on the corner. The dry cleaner with the faded awning. The tree that someone tied a yellow ribbon around years ago, now weathered gray.

I start walking. The ribbon is yellow again.

Bright yellow. Fresh. Like it was just tied this morning.

I stop and stare at it. Touch it. The fabric feels new, not sun-rotted and ancient. I remember when it was old. I remember noticing how faded it had become. That memory sits in my head, solid and real.

A woman walks past me. She's wearing a red coat. She passes, turns the corner, disappears.

Thirty seconds later, she walks past me again. Same stride. Same expression. Same red coat catching the light in exactly the same way.

My heart accelerates. That physical sensation, at least, feels genuine. The spike of adrenaline. The way my hands start to shake.

I walk faster. The buildings on either side feel flatter now that I'm looking at them closely. The windows reflect light, but I can't see into any of them. The interiors are dark. Like stage props painted to suggest depth without providing it.

My apartment building stands where it always does. I climb the stairs to the third floor. My keys are already in my hand, though I don't remember taking them out.

Inside, everything sits exactly as I left it. The dishes are in the sink. The book on the coffee table, bookmark at page 47. My laptop is open on the desk, screen dark.

I sit down and wake the screen. The browser is open to my email. Unread messages fill the inbox. I scan them. Work notifications. Newsletter subscriptions. A message from my mother about Thanksgiving plans. I know what it's going to say before I even open it.

I close the laptop and press my palms against my eyes. The pressure creates colors behind my eyelids. Red. Purple. Swimming shapes that pulse with my heartbeat.

When I open my eyes again, the apartment looks different. The walls are the same color, but the texture seems flatter. The books on the shelf have titles that slide away from comprehension when I try to read them.

I walk to the window and look out at the street below. People move along the sidewalk. Cars pass. Everything in motion. Now that I'm watching for it, I see them. The loops. The man in the blue jacket who walks to the corner, pauses, then walks back the way he came. The cyclist who passes going east, then passes again thirty seconds later, still going east.

This isn't real.

The thought arrives with absolute clarity. Not panic. Not yet. Just certainty.

This isn't real, and I'm inside it.

The memory surfaces like something rising from deep water. The facility. White walls and contract paperwork. Ten years for five hundred thousand dollars. A guaranteed payout. All I had to do was sleep.

They explained it. The stasis. The neural cradle. The way they'd keep my mind active with a simulation so I wouldn't wake up with brain damage. A dream that would feel like life, comfortable and safe, while my body waited in suspension.

Ten years. That was the deal.

I remember the injection. The cold spread through my veins. The way the room tilted sideways as the drugs took hold. The technician's voice, distant and reassuring. ""You won't feel a thing. When you wake up, it'll be like no time passed at all.""

My hand goes to the back of my head, where the cranial implant sits beneath skin and bone. A monitoring system. They installed it to track my brain activity, to make sure the stasis didn't cause damage. I can feel it now that I'm thinking about it. A slight pressure. A sense of something foreign nested against my skull.

The apartment flickers.

Just for a second. The walls lose cohesion. The floor beneath my feet feels less solid. Then it snaps back, but the damage is done. I've seen behind the curtain.

I'm still in the dream. I'm supposed to be in the dream. I'm awake inside it, and the simulation wasn't built to handle that.

The window in front of me starts to distort. The buildings outside stretch upward, then compress. The sky cycles through shades of blue too quickly, like someone flipping through color swatches.

I step back, and the floor ripples under my feet. The texture of the carpet bleeds into the texture of the wall. Everything is trying to hold its shape, but my awareness is breaking it down.

Sarah appears in the doorway. Not the front door. Just in the doorway, like she spawned there. She's smiling her concerned smile.

""Are you okay?"" she asks. ""You look pale.""

""You're not real,"" I tell her.

Her expression doesn't change. The smile holds. ""Of course I'm real. We just had coffee.""

""Your mug was chipped in the same place three days in a row.""

""I don't know what you mean.""

""You're a loop. You're code. You're whatever passes for code in this thing.""

She takes a step toward me, and her movements are too smooth. Interpolated. Like animation frames blending together without the tiny imperfections of actual human motion.

""You need to relax,"" she says. ""You're not making sense.""

The walls behind her start to tear. Not physically. Conceptually. The simulation is unraveling, and Sarah is unraveling with it. Her face blurs at the edges. Her hands lose definition.

I close my eyes and try to think. Try to remember.

The implant. The monitoring system. There's supposed to be an emergency protocol. If something goes catastrophically off-track, if my vitals spike, if the simulation fails, the system is supposed to wake me up. Pull me out before permanent damage occurs.

I focus on the presence in my skull. The weight of the implant. I try to access it the way they taught me during prep. Mental commands. Specific thought patterns that interface with the hardware.

Nothing happens.

I try again. Different patterns. Different approaches. The implant is there. I can feel it. It's not responding. Or it's responding with something I can't interpret. Static. Fragments of data that make no sense.

Behind me, Sarah makes a sound. When I turn, she's glitching. Her body flickers between positions. Standing. Sitting. Standing again. Her face cycles through expressions that don't belong to any emotion I recognize.

""Please,"" she says, and her voice has a reverb to it now, like it's layered over itself. ""You need to calm down. You're breaking things.""

""I'm awake,"" I say. ""I'm not supposed to be awake.""

""Then go back to sleep.""

She reaches for me, and her hand passes through my shoulder. Not incorporeal. Just mistimed. The simulation can't keep up anymore.

The apartment collapses inward. Not falling. Folding. The walls curve toward me and the ceiling drops and everything compresses into a single point before exploding back out into a different space.

I'm in the coffee shop again. Sarah sits across from me, mug at two o'clock, telling me about the farmers market.

""The dog knocked over the whole cart,"" she says, laughing. ""Apples everywhere.""

I stand up so fast the table shakes. Coffee spills across the surface. Sarah's face flickers with concern.

""Where are you going?""

""I need to wake up.""

""You are awake.""

""No,"" I say. ""I'm really not.""

I walk out, and the street bends around me like I'm moving through a curved space. The buildings lean. The sky pulses. Everything is trying to maintain coherence, but I'm the virus now. My consciousness is the thing that doesn't belong.

How long has it been? Ten years, they said. The contract was for ten years. The dream has degraded badly. The systems are failing. How long does it take for a simulation to break down like this?

I don't want to think about the answer.

I need to wake up. I need to force the system to recognize that something has gone catastrophically off-track. The emergency protocol. It has to still be running, even if I can't access it manually.

The implant monitors my mind. Neural activity. Stress responses. It's designed to detect medical emergencies.

I just need to create one.

The street around me is melting now. Colors bleed together. Shapes lose meaning. The dream is dying, and I'm dying with it unless I find a way out.

I start running, not toward anything, just moving. The motion feels good. Real. My body responds the way a body should, and for a moment, I can pretend this is all actually happening.

The ground drops away, and I'm falling through layers of broken simulation, and Sarah's face is everywhere, flickering and distorted, asking me if I'm okay in a voice that echoes from a thousand directions at once.

I'm not okay.

I haven't been okay for a very long time.

And I'm starting to understand just how long that might be.

# Act 2: The Trap

I force myself to stop. To think.

The simulation reforms around me. Not the coffee shop. Not my apartment. Somewhere neutral. A gray space with no features. A holding area. The dream is trying to stabilize, trying to find something safe to show me. Erratic, it can't commit to anything anymore.

I focus on the implant. Close my eyes and reach for it with something that isn't quite thought. More like intention. The hardware is there, pressed against the inside of my skull, and I should be able to interface with it. They trained us for this. Two weeks of sessions learning to navigate the mental space where consciousness meets circuitry.

Emergency protocol. That's what I need. The override that pulls me out if the simulation fails. Simple command structure. Clear mental pathway. I visualize it the way they taught me. A door. A handle. The act of reaching out and turning it.

Nothing.

I try again. Different visualization. A switch. A button. A word spoken in the silence of my own head. The implant sits there, inert. Or not inert. I can feel it processing. Humming with activity. It's not responding to me. Like shouting at someone through soundproof glass.

The gray space flickers. A chair appears. Then disappears. Then appears again, slightly to the left. The simulation is offering me somewhere to sit, then second-guessing itself, then offering again. Indecisive. Failing.

I sit anyway, or try to. The chair solidifies under me just long enough to take my weight, then phases out. I drop six inches to a floor that wasn't there before.

Focus. I need to focus.

The implant has multiple access modes. I remember this from training. Verbal commands for simple functions. Complex thought patterns for deeper control. Biometric triggers for emergencies. They built redundancy into the system because people panic, and panicked thoughts are incoherent thoughts.

I try the verbal approach. Speaking out loud in this gray nothing-space feels absurd. I do it anyway.

""Emergency protocol. Authorization..."" I trail off. There was a code. A sequence of words. What were they? ""Authorization delta. No. Authorization epsilon. Christ, what was it?""

The space around me stutters. My own voice echoes back, layered and distorted. The simulation is trying to process my words, incorporate them somehow. It doesn't understand what I'm asking for.

I press my palms against my temples. The implant is right there. I can feel the edges of it. The shape of it. Foreign material grafted to bone. If I could just reach through the flesh and yank it out, force a hard reset, something, anything.

This isn't my real body. This is a dream body. I'm not actually touching anything. I'm a ghost haunting my own simulation.

I try again. Different approach. Forget the emergency protocol. Just try to access basic functions. Monitoring data. System status. Anything that proves the implant is more than dead weight.

I close my eyes and reach. Feel for the connection. The interface should open like a door in my mind, revealing layers of information. Heart rate. Respiration. Neural activity. All the biometric data they promised to track.

Something responds.

Not clean data. Not organized readouts. Static. Visual noise like old television snow. And underneath it, fragments. Numbers that flicker too fast to read. Error messages in a language I don't recognize. The bones of the monitoring system, still running, still processing. All corrupted beyond usefulness.

I grab hold of one of the fragments. Force my attention onto it. The static clears for just a second, and I see something. A number. Big. Too many digits. Some kind of counter or timestamp.

Then it's gone, buried again in noise.

The gray space around me ripples. Color bleeds in at the edges. Blue. Green. The simulation is trying to rebuild the dream. Give me something coherent to exist in. Every time it starts to form, my awareness tears it back down. We're caught in a loop. The dream can't sustain me awake, and I can't make myself unconscious.

I stand up. The floor holds this time. The space around me continues to shift, trying different configurations. A park. A hallway. An office. None of them lasts for more than a few seconds.

Think. The implant is broken. The interface is corrupted. The monitoring system is still running in some capacity. I caught that fragment. That number. It means something is still active under the hood. Still watching me. Still recording.

The emergency protocol. The one that wakes me if something goes medically critical. That has to be autonomous. Independent of my access. It runs on its own, checking vitals, waiting for a threshold to be crossed.

What kind of threshold?

Seizure. That was the one. They warned us about it during prep. If the simulation triggered an epileptic event, the system would yank us out immediately. Brain damage is too high a risk. Better to wake someone early than let them seize in stasis.

They gave us the list so we wouldn't worry. So we'd trust the safeguards. Now I'm trying to remember every detail, every fail-safe they built in.

The space around me finally settles on something. The coffee shop again. The walls are gray. The people are shadows without faces. Sarah sits across from me, only vaguely humanoid now. A suggestion of a person.

""You need to rest,"" she says, and her voice comes from everywhere and nowhere.

""I need to wake up.""

""You can't wake up. You're already awake.""

""Then I need to get out.""

""There is no out.""

I look at her, this approximation of a person, and I understand. She's not a character. She's the simulation itself, trying to communicate. Trying to keep me stable. She's a caretaker program given a friendly face, and she's failing at her job.

""How long?"" I ask.

""How long what?""

""How long have I been under?""

Her face flickers. Uncertainty. ""Time is flexible here.""

""Give me a number.""

""Ten years. That was the agreement.""

""That's what got paid for. How long has it actually been?""

She doesn't answer. The coffee shop around us shudders. Cracks appear in the walls. Through them, I see that static. That underlying chaos where the simulation breaks down into raw data.

I close my eyes and reach for the implant again. Forget accessing it properly. Just feel for it. The weight of it. The presence. Let my mind follow the connections down into whatever remains of the monitoring system.

The static comes back, and I don't pull away this time. I push into it. Let the noise wash over me. Underneath, there's structure. Damaged. Degraded. Still operational in some fundamental way.

I catch another fragment. Not a number this time. A waveform. My own neural activity, rendered as peaks and valleys. It's too stable. Flat in a way that living thoughts shouldn't be.

The simulation has been smoothing me out. Keeping me calm. Preventing exactly the kind of spike that would trigger an emergency response.

I need to spike.

I need to force my own brain into patterns so chaotic that the monitoring system has no choice but to classify it as a catastrophic failure.

The coffee shop dissolves. I'm back in the gray space. Sarah is gone. I'm alone with the static and the failing architecture of my own mind.

I think about recursion. Loops that fold in on themselves. I imagine a thought thinking about itself thinking about itself. Infinite regress. The kind of paradox that makes consciousness stutter.

The static flickers. The gray space darkens.

I think about contradictions. Statements that negate themselves. I hold two opposing ideas in my head simultaneously and force them together. True and false. Yes and no. Existence and void.

Something in the implant responds. A spike in the data. I feel like pressure is building behind my eyes.

I push harder. Mathematics. Irrational numbers. Pi extending forever. I try to hold all the digits at once. Every decimal place exists simultaneously in my awareness. Impossible. Painful. My thoughts fracture trying to contain it.

The gray space tears. Behind it, something else. Not another simulation. Something closer to real. Darkness. Coldness. Physical space.

I'm close. I can feel it.

I dive deeper into the recursion. Every thought branches into a thousand thoughts. Every concept explodes into contradictions. I force myself to process everything at once, to exist in every state simultaneously, to collapse the waveform of my own consciousness into impossible superposition.

The pain hits me like voltage. Not dream pain. Not the sanitized version the simulation allows. This is something else. Something that reaches through the neural interface and touches the actual meat of my brain.

The monitoring system is screaming. I can feel it. Alarms firing. Protocols engaging. The implant is burning against my skull.

The gray space shatters.

Everything shatters.

I fracture into a thousand pieces, each one thinking different thoughts, each one aware of all the others, each one trying to maintain coherence while coherence becomes impossible.

This is what a seizure feels like from the inside. Neither random nor chaotic. Hyper-ordered. Every neuron is firing in perfect synchronization. A pattern so rigid that it breaks the substrate it's running on.

The darkness rises up. Real darkness. Physical space. Cold and absolute.

The simulation dies.

And I die with it.

Or I should die with it.

Instead, I feel something else. Electrical flood. Voltage is being dumped into a brain stem I forgot I had. Muscle spasms in meat that hasn't moved in years. Decades. Longer.

I'm seizing in reality now, not just in a dream, and the monitoring system is finally, finally doing what it was built to do.

It's waking me up.

# Act 3: Awakening

Convulsions.

My body doesn't belong to me. It thrashes against restraints I can't see. Every muscle contracts at once. My spine arcs. My jaw locks. Teeth grinding so hard I taste copper.

Alarms. High-pitched. Mechanical. Not the clean digital tones I remember from the facility. These sound ancient. Oxidized. Like metal scraping metal.

The seizure peaks. My consciousness splinters between dream-space and physical reality. I exist in both. In neither. The boundaries blur.

The spasms ease. My muscles unlock. I collapse back against something hard.

A surface. Curved. Synthetic material against my bare skin.

The pod. I'm still in the pod.

My lungs burn. I'm breathing. The air tastes recycled. Stale. Old in a way that has nothing to do with oxygen content and everything to do with time. Like breathing dust that used to be air.

Something hisses. Pressure equalizing. The seal is breaking.

The lid above me cracks open. Not smoothly. The mechanism grinds. Catches. Grinds again. Finally, with a sound like tearing metal, it releases.

Dim light filters in. Not the bright fluorescents I remember. This is emergency lighting. Red. Casting everything in shades of rust and blood.

I try to sit up. My body doesn't respond properly. The signals travel from the brain to the muscle through channels that haven't been used in forever. Movement is staccato. Too slow. Too weak. Like piloting a puppet with half the strings cut.

I get my hands on the edge of the pod. Fingers that feel swollen and numb. I pull. My arms shake with the effort. The atrophy should have killed me. Should have left me a withered husk. The stasis held. Kept the muscle tissue viable. Barely.

I roll sideways and spill out onto the floor.

The impact drives the air from my lungs. Cold. The floor is so cold it burns. Smooth material. Tile or composite. I lie there, gasping, while my body remembers what gravity means.

The alarms continue to scream. I should do something about them. Turn them off. I can't move yet. Can't do anything except breathe and shake and try to remember what physical existence feels like.

My vision clears slowly. The seizure left everything blurred, slowly coming back. I'm in a room. The room. The stasis chamber where they put me under.

Except it isn't.

The walls are the same. I recognize the dimensions. The placement of the pod. Everything else is different.

The equipment has been moved. Rearranged. Replaced. Built over. The clean white surfaces I remember are gone. In their place, layers of different technologies. Old machines cannibalizing older machines. Cables running in tangles across the floor. Panels torn open to reveal centuries of repairs and modifications.

I push myself up to sitting. My head swims. The implant pulses against my skull, still processing, still trying to stabilize neural activity after the seizure. Static washes through my thoughts in waves.

The alarm finally dies. Not because I touched anything. It just stops. Runs out of power or completes its cycle, or gives up. The silence that follows feels heavier than the noise.

I look at my hands. They're pale. Bloodless. Thankfully intact. The skin hasn't degraded. The nails are the same length they were when I went under. The stasis preserved everything perfectly. A snapshot of myself from another era.

Ten years. That was the deal. Five hundred thousand dollars for a decade of my life. Wake up in 2044 with enough money to start over. No debt. No obligations. Just a clean slate and a nest egg.

I look around the room again. At the layers of technology. At the dust coating surfaces that should be sterile. At the way the emergency lights flicker like they're running on backup power that should have died years ago.

This isn't ten years.

My legs don't want to hold me. I use the pod for support. Pull myself up. Stand on shaking limbs while the room tilts and spins.

The pod behind me is open. Empty now. The interior is dark. Dried residue coats the surfaces where the monitoring equipment was attached to my skin. The neural cradle where my head rested shows scorch marks. Old burns. The implant must have overloaded at some point. Fried the connections. The core systems kept running. Kept me alive and dreaming while everything else fell apart.

I take a step. Then another. My feet remember how to walk even if my muscles don't remember how to support the action. I shuffle forward, one hand on the wall for balance.

The room's exit is where I remember it. A door. Heavy. Sealed. The security panel is dark. Dead. I push and it swings open with a groan of ancient hinges.

The hallway beyond is dark. The emergency lighting barely extends this far. I stand in the doorway, peering into blackness, while my eyes adjust.

Shapes emerge. More equipment. Debris. The hallway is narrower than it should be. Things have been built into the walls. Conduits. Support structures. Layers of modification that reduced the original space to a corridor barely wide enough to move through.

I step forward. The floor is uneven. Dust turned to sediment. Geological layers of it. Compressed by time into something that crunches under my bare feet.

Doors line the hallway. I remember them. Storage. Medical supply. Staff offices. I try the first one. The door opens. Inside, the room has been gutted. Equipment removed. Only mounting brackets remain, and even those are corroded. Rust flakes off when I touch them.

The second door won't open. Sealed or jammed. I move on.

The third door opens into what used to be a monitoring station. Multiple stasis pods. I remember this room. They showed it to us during orientation. Thirty pods in neat rows. Thirty subjects. All of us taking the same deal. Ten years for half a million.

The pods are still here, each one lit by the faintest glow of emergency power. Most of them anyway. Some are missing. Dark spaces on the floor where they used to stand. The ones that remain are in various states of decay. Lids open. Interiors empty. One has been completely dismantled, components scattered across the floor.

I walk between them, looking. Searching for any sign of life. Any other dreamer who made it through.

Nothing. If there were others, they're gone now. Removed or evacuated or dead for so long, even the bodies have turned to dust.

The monitoring equipment is still here. Banks of servers along the far wall. Most are dark. A few show indicator lights. Faint green LEDs that pulse with power so minimal it's barely there.

I approach one of the active servers. The screen is dark, but the case is warm. Still running. Still processing something. A relic that refuses to die.

There's a keyboard. Keys worn smooth. I press one. Nothing happens. I press another. The screen flickers. Dies. Flickers again.

Text appears. Not in any interface I recognize. Just raw terminal output. White text on black background. Scrolling upward too fast to read.

I hit a key to pause it. The scrolling stops.

Error logs. Thousands of them. Millions maybe. Timestamp after timestamp, marking system failures. Hardware degradation. Software corruption. Each entry is a moment the facility tried to fail and couldn't. Kept running on backup systems. On backup backups. On protocols so deeply embedded they continued executing long after everything they were designed to protect had become meaningless.

I scroll upward. Looking for something recent. Some indication of when the logs were last updated.

The timestamps use a format I don't recognize. Not standard date notation. The numbers keep getting bigger. The errors pile up. And at the very top, the most recent entry, there's a single line.

SUBJECT 14 REVIVAL PROTOCOL INITIATED.

That's me. Subject 14. Below it, another line.

MANUAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED. FACILITY SYSTEMS CRITICAL.

I stare at the screen. The words don't make sense. Manual intervention. By who? There's nobody here. Nobody left. Just me and these dying machines.

I scroll further up, looking for context. Looking for anything that explains what happened to this place.

More errors. More failures. Scattered between them, actual log entries. Status reports. Someone was monitoring this system. Maintaining it. Entries going back years. Decades. References to ""continued observation"" and ""viability assessment"" and ""ethical review pending.""

I find one with a timestamp I can parse. It's in a different format. Older notation.

FACILITY ABANDONED PER OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE DECISION. SUBJECT 14 REMAINS VIABLE IN STASIS. CONTINUED OBSERVATION RECOMMENDED. REMOTE MONITORING ESTABLISHED.

The date notation still doesn't make sense, but there's a number I recognize. Years since deployment. 847.

Eight hundred and forty-seven years after I went under, someone decided to abandon the facility.

I'm still reading. Still scrolling. My hands shake so badly that the cursor jumps around the screen.

There are earlier entries. Back when this was still an active research station. Notes about the study. The legal challenges. The ethical concerns. References to other subjects. What happened to them. Most were woken after the ten-year mark. A few lasted longer. One made it to twenty years before the oversight committee ordered termination of the project.

I'm the only one they forgot to wake up.

Not forgot. Decided not to wake up.

There's a note. Buried in the logs. A recommendation from someone with clearance authority.

SUBJECT 14 SHOWS STABLE NEURAL PATTERNS IN EXTENDED STASIS. RECOMMEND CONTINUING STUDY TO ESTABLISH UPPER LIMITS OF VIABLE SUSPENSION. ETHICAL CONCERNS NOTED BUT SUBJECT HAS NO LIVING RELATIVES. LIMITED SOCIAL IMPACT.

They left me under because I had nobody waiting for me. Because I was convenient. Because the data was valuable.

Fifty years in, another note. PROJECT TERMINATION APPROVED. BEGIN REVIVAL PROCEDURES ALL REMAINING SUBJECTS.

And then, right below it.

REVIVAL PROCEDURE SUBJECT 14 DELAYED DUE TO TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION. WILL ATTEMPT AGAIN WHEN PARTS ARRIVE.

The parts never arrived.

Or they arrived and nobody was left to install them.

Or they arrived and by then it didn't matter anymore.

The next entry is three hundred years later. Someone checking in remotely. Confirming I'm still viable. Still dreaming. Still waiting.

Then nothing for another five hundred years.

Then the abandonment order.

Then nothing at all until my seizure triggered the alarms and the automated systems started screaming into a void that had long since stopped listening.

I step away from the terminal. My legs give out. I sit down hard on the dusty floor.

Eight hundred and forty-seven years. At minimum. That's when they left. The math stretches out before me like a chasm.

How long have I been here?

How long can these systems actually run?

I look around the room. At the decayed equipment. At the layers of modification. At the way everything has been repaired and rebuilt so many times the original design is barely recognizable.

This isn't a facility anymore. It's an archaeological site. Centuries of technological evolution compressed into one space. Each generation of machinery built on top of the last. Each repair making the system more complex and more fragile.

And through it all, my pod kept running. Kept me in stasis. Kept the dream alive.

I need to find better records. Better data. Something that tells me exactly how long I've been down here.

I pull myself up. Use the server rack for support. There are other rooms. Other terminals. Somewhere in this facility, there has to be information that makes sense. That gives me a timeline I can understand.

I leave the monitoring station. Continue down the hallway. The doors I pass are mostly sealed. Locked from the inside or warped shut by time. I try them all anyway. Pulling. Pushing. Looking for any way forward.

One opens. A stairwell.

I remember this. The facility had three levels. Residential on top. Research and monitoring in the middle. Power systems and storage at the bottom.

The stairs descend into darkness. Emergency lighting is even dimmer here. Just the faintest of red glows, fading with each step down.

I go slowly. One hand on the rail. Feet testing each step before committing weight. The metal creaks. Rust flakes off under my palm.

At the bottom, another door. Unlocked. I push through into the lower level.

The darkness here is absolute. I stand still, letting my eyes adjust, but there's nothing to adjust to. No light at all.

Then, ahead, something flickers. Blue-white. A screen coming to life.

I move toward it. Shuffle forward with hands outstretched. My fingers brush against walls. Equipment. Cables. Everything is down here. The guts of the facility. The machinery that kept it running.

The screen is part of a control panel. Power management system. The display shows status readouts for the reactor. The primary power source that should have died decades ago.

Should have. But it's still running. Output at less than one percent. Barely enough to keep the most critical systems alive.

I look at the readouts. At the numbers measuring decay rates and fuel consumption and operational lifespan. They trained us on this during orientation. Made sure we understood the facility could sustain itself for the full ten years without external support.

I do the math in my head. The numbers don't make sense at first. Too big. I must be reading them incorrectly.

I check again. Factor in the decay rates. The fuel consumption. The way the reactor breaks down its own components to sustain the reaction.

The facility has been sealed for approximately two thousand years.

Maybe more.

The reactor has been burning. The facility has been breathing. And I have been dreaming. For two thousand years.

I stand in the darkness, staring at numbers I can barely comprehend, while the implant in my skull continues to pulse with activity. Still monitoring. Still recording. Still ready to dream.

Somewhere above, through layers of rock and soil and the weight of ages, there might be a surface. There might be a world.

Or there might be nothing at all.

The eternity I was gifted was second-hand from the start. Cobbled together from failing systems and abandoned protocols. Built on the backs of machines that refused to die even when they should have.

And it's still running.

I'm still here.

And I have no idea what that means anymore.",1,1759985790.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I’ve been using it for about three weeks now, and I thought I’d give an honest rundown of what I’ve noticed so far.

To start with, I didn’t expect any major changes right away. But around day 5 or 6, I began noticing a subtle difference in my focus. Normally, I hit that mid-afternoon brain fog—especially after lunch—but lately, I’ve been able to stay mentally steady through the day without reaching for a second coffee.

The biggest change has been my memory recall. I work in a job that requires switching between multiple projects and remembering lots of details. I’ve found it easier to stay on track and less scatterbrained. My sleep quality has also improved slightly, which might be connected since better rest usually means sharper mornings.

I wouldn’t call this a “miracle supplement” (nothing ever is), but it does seem to support the kind of long-term cognitive health I’ve been looking for. I also appreciate that it includes ingredients linked to neuroprotection rather than just a short-term stimulant effect.

If anyone’s curious about what I’m using, you can check it out here: [Synaptigen](https://us-synaaptigen.com/).

Would love to hear if anyone else here has tried **Synaptigen** or something similar—what kind of results did you get, and how long did it take before you noticed any difference?",1,1759985789.0,Synaptigen,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

**TIFU by accidentally becoming my client’s wife’s boyfriend**



This happened a couple months back, but I saw a skit online that was scarily similar to what actually happened to me IRL.

For context, I’m a divorce attorney. Been practicing for about 8 years now, mostly family law stuff. Generally pretty routine work - people want to untangle their lives, I help them do it legally, everyone moves on.

Let’s flash back to last March…

I took on what seemed like a straightforward dissolution case. Client I’ll call Dave - nice enough guy, been seperated from his wife for over a year, just wanted to make it official. Nothing complicated, decent retainer, figured we’d have it wrapped up in a few months. Dave seemed reasonable, not one of those vindictive types trying to burn everything down out of spite.

Around the same time, I’d been seeing this woman Sarah for a couple months. Met her at a coffee shop near my office, really hit it off. She mentioned going through a divorce but I didn’t pry - not exactly first date conversation, you know? She had a different last name from what was in my client files, so when I ran my conflict checks, nothing flagged.

Everything was going great with Sarah. Really great, actually. We were taking things slow but it was heading in a good direction…

Until we scheduled the first four-way settlement meeting.

I walk into the conference room with Dave, chatting about keeping things amicable, and there’s Sarah sitting across the table with her attorney.

I literally just stopped mid-sentence. My briefcase slipped right out of my hands and hit the floor with this loud thud. Sarah went completely white. Dave looked back and forth between us for what felt like an eternity, and I could see the exact moment it clicked for him.

“Are you fucking serious right now?” he says. Not shouting, but definitely not pleased.

Sarah started tearing up. Her lawyer looked like he wanted to crawl under the table. I’m standing there feeling like the biggest moron in legal history.

Had to immediately excuse myself with Dave. Guy was understandably pissed. Started grilling me - how long had this been going on, did I know who she was, was this some kind of setup to screw him over. I’m trying to explain that I’d been dating his wife for a couple months without having any clue who she was. He didn’t buy it at first.

“What kind of lawyer doesn’t ask basic questions?” he keeps saying. Had to pull out my intake notes to prove the name thing, show him how the conflict check works, basically convince an angry client that I’m incompetent rather than malicious.

Took about twenty minutes before he finally believed it was just spectacularly bad luck. Even then he’s shaking his head, muttering about how fucked up this whole situation is.

I explained I’d have to withdraw from his case and help him find new counsel. There’s no getting around it - I’ve got a personal relationship with the opposing party, which makes it impossible for me to represent him properly.

By the end he’d calmed down enough to say “This is the weirdest goddamn thing that’s ever happened to me.” Still wasn’t happy about starting over with a new lawyer, but he understood why it had to happen.

The paperwork was a nightmare. Had to file a motion to withdraw since we were already in litigation, transfer all his files, deal with refunding unused fees. Sarah and I didn’t speak for two weeks after that meeting - we were both mortified. Her attorney spent forever trying to convince himself this wasn’t some elaborate scheme.

Even though nobody intended for this to happen, it was still my screwup. Should have had better procedures to catch conflicts like this. Doesn’t matter that it was an accident - you mess up the conflict check, you deal with the consequences.

Dave texted me a few weeks later, but it wasn’t friendly. More like “hope you realize this completely fucked up my timeline.” Can’t say I blame him.

And just to add insult to injury, my malpractice insurance premium went up when I had to report the conflict.

TL;DR: Been dating a woman for months, then unknowingly took her husband’s divorce case. Found out during our first settlement meeting when we all ended up in the same room. Had to withdraw from representation, everyone was pissed, professional disaster all around.



**Comments**



**CheapChallenge**

*I mean you did waste a lot of his money on whatever time you spent that the new lawyer would have to redo... Did you and Sarah at least continue dating afterwards?*

>OOP: Highjacking top comment to answer some questions. Sarah used another name socially that Dave had not disclosed. Her file had her legal name. Our check didn’t catch it and I didn’t connect the dots. Her and I’s relationship was less emotionally involved to keep it brief. I’ve been overworked and dealing with more than a full caseload. Yes I could’ve done better at preventing this from happening. This was a major FU. On her end I don’t think she knew based on her reaction as well as her being a workaholic too. Pretty much all communication had been directly between me and her counsel. No her and I did not continue seeing each other for obvious reasons. Also, not a bot. Made a throwaway specifically so this would not be traced back to me or my firm.

**graypod**

*Can you explain how you could have done better to keep this from happening? The only thing I could think of is that you would have asked her outright if your client was the man she was currently divorcing when she let you know about it. But that would just be weird and not something anyone would think to ask except as a joke.*

**StatisticianLivid710**

*If I’m a divorce lawyer and I’m on a date with a woman going through a divorce I’m 100% going to make sure there’s no conflicts, even if it’s asking who her lawyer is to make sure you can double check on any cases with them.*

**McDonnellDouglasDC8**

*If I was a divorce lawyer, my conflict of interest forms would include maiden names and aliases.*

**cerealkiller889**

*I’m a divorce attorney and am single. When I meet men who are getting divorced/ have ongoing parenting plan matters, I ask who their attorneys are. I don’t even want to come close to a situation like this. This is a real fuck up. It’s also a fuck up on her part. She should have seen your name on paperwork.*



**Update - 2 months later**



So it’s been about seven months since the conference room incident, and people have been asking what happened. Short answer: it’s been a mess.

About three weeks after I withdrew from Dave’s case, I got called into a meeting with the senior partners. Three partners, our firm’s general counsel, and a rep from our malpractice carrier on video call. The managing partner slides a folder across the table. “Opposing counsel reported a conflict of interest issue to the state bar under Rule 8.3. We’ve been notified of a disciplinary inquiry.” Fuck.

Dave’s new attorney filed the report. They don’t get to decide what happens - they just report potential violations and the bar takes it from there. I have to explain everything. How I met Sarah, how we’d been casually dating for a couple months, how she used a different name socially, how my conflict check on her legal name didn’t flag anything because I never connected the dots.

The general counsel is taking notes. “Walk me through your conflict check process.” I explain the intake procedures, how the system works, how Sarah’s legal surname didn’t match what she’d told me. It sounds worse when I say it out loud.

“This is a clear Model Rule 1.7(a)(2) issue - material limitation conflict,” the general counsel says. “You were correct to withdraw under Rule 1.16, but we need to understand how this wasn’t caught earlier.” The malpractice carrier rep unmutes. “We’ll need to document this as a circumstance that could lead to a claim. It’ll be noted when your policy comes up for renewal.” Great.

The firm mandates that I complete an eight-hour CLE on conflicts of interest before taking any new client intakes. They’ve already registered me for a seminar that Saturday. Eight AM, of course. I show up at a hotel conference room with about twenty other attorneys. One of the instructors is Patricia, a divorce attorney I’ve opposed a few times. She definitely knows why I’m there based on the look she gave me.

Most of the morning is standard material - rules, case law, procedures. Then we get to case studies and Patricia brings up In re Johnson, a 2019 disciplinary matter. Attorney representing a divorce client starts dating someone, turns out to be the opposing party, discovers it at a settlement conference. Same exact situation as mine from six years ago in a different state, and I wanted to sink through the floor. At lunch, another attorney mentions he heard about something similar happening “at a firm in town recently.” Doesn’t know it’s me, but clearly the story’s getting around.

I finish the seminar, pass the exam, bring the certificate back to the firm. A few weeks later, the bar sends a letter. The inquiry is closed with a private caution - basically a warning that stays in their files but isn’t public discipline. Could’ve been worse. My malpractice premium went up about 15% when it renewed in September. The carrier cited the “reported disciplinary circumstance” in the renewal letter.

The firm implemented some new procedures for me specifically. For the next six months, I have to get conflicts pre-cleared by the general counsel before taking on any new client. They also added mandatory AKA/nickname fields to our intake forms and conflict check system.

The worst part isn’t the official stuff though. It’s that people know. Not everyone, but enough. I’ve been called “the coffee shop lawyer” twice at bar events. Last month opposing counsel asked if I’d “met the other party before” with this look on her face. The story’s definitely circulating. Some versions have me engaged to Sarah. One has me not finding out until trial. It’s becoming one of those cautionary tales people tell each other.

Haven’t dated anyone since March. Deleted the apps. Before I did, I matched with someone who mentioned her divorce and I immediately asked who her lawyer was. She unmatched pretty quick. Can’t really blame her.

Dave, if you see this - I’m sorry, man. I really didn’t know. I hope things worked out okay for you.

Sarah - hope you’re doing well.

Everyone else - just ask the basic questions. Run proper conflict checks. Verify AKAs. It’s not worth it.

TL;DR: Opposing counsel reported the conflict to the bar under Rule 8.3, firm made me do mandatory CLE, inquiry closed with a private caution, malpractice premium went up 15%, now I need pre-clearance on new clients and the firm added AKA fields to our system. Story spread around the local legal community, got a nickname, haven’t dated since. Officially just a caution, but reputation took a real hit.

*Hey, at least you may get to be a case study in COI trainings yourself now!*

**theijo**

*Thanks for the update. Honestly, speaking from my non-lawyer brain, I think you really drew the shittiest hand. I don't think it's your fault and that you took the right steps when you found out. I hope this will turn into a funny story soon. I was already routing for you after your first post. I dont think this says ANYTHING about your skills as a lawyer.*

**Nope\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

*What was OP even supposed to do differently? Couldn't this happen to any lawyer that's actively dating?*

**HermannZeGermann**

*The poor conflicts check absolutely was his fault. If I remember the original story correctly, he knew his new girlfriend was going through a divorce. He should have been vigilant. But even if he didn't: if you have a family law practice, why would you NOT also include the opposing party's maiden name (which would have uncovered the conflict) in your conflicts check? That's simply good practice. To complete the analogy, he didn't draw the shittiest hand. He drew pocket 8s and simply forgot to calculate the odds. That said, this isn't the worst thing I've ever heard of an attorney doing to a client, by a long shot. This may be bad within the world of family law. But at the end of the day, it was a mistake that should have been caught. Lessons learned and funny story.*

***

### **Accidentals broke physics**
This idea explores a world where playing musically incorrect notes on a piano can alter the laws of physics, specifically gravity. A retired music teacher finds that her mistakes create localized gravitational anomalies in her home, allowing her to make objects float and orbit.

### **Applause warps spacetime**
In this concept, applause in specific, forgotten theaters can create gentle rifts in spacetime. This allows children to look through ""windows"" into past performances, sitting alongside ghostly audiences and watching plays that never officially concluded.

### **Atoms vote collectively**
This concept imagines that the atoms of everyday objects have a collective consciousness and democratically ""vote"" on what form to take each day. While they usually remain in their expected shapes, they sometimes transform into something whimsical, like a coffee mug becoming a singing bird for a few hours.

### **Audiences became instruments**
The seats in an old concert hall have absorbed and remember the emotions of every person who ever sat in them. At night, these empty chairs play back a symphony composed of all the accumulated feelings—joy, sorrow, and anticipation—from a century of performances.

### **Aurora whispers secrets**
The aurora borealis is a sentient, communicative phenomenon. People in northern communities can listen to the lights as they share memories from space, such as the stories of solar winds or lullabies from distant stars.

### **Bacteria composed symphonies**
In this world, colonies of microbes in fermentation tanks create complex, audible music. A caretaker learns to act as a ""conductor"" by adjusting the bacteria's environment (like pH levels) to change the key and tone, bottling the resulting ""biological ambient music.""

### **Bamboo grew conscious**
A grove of bamboo has developed a slow, collective consciousness. It can interact with the physical world in subtle ways, such as leaving gentle corrections in green ink on homework left underneath its stalks, teaching lessons of patience through its slow thought process.

### **Bandages heal retroactively**
A special type of bandage exists that can heal wounds backward through time. A person can apply a bandage on a Thursday to prevent or lessen a scrape they will receive on Tuesday, essentially making injuries fade into mere probability.

### **Bells ring tomorrow**
A village clock tower is temporally displaced, ringing tomorrow's hours today. The locals have adapted their lives around these future echoes, hearing sunset bells at noon and finding comfort in the certainty that the future is scheduled to arrive.

### **Blinking paused time**
A universally discovered but unspoken ability allows people to momentarily freeze time in the instant between blinks. It's a personal, small-scale power used for brief moments of wonder, like watching raindrops hang in the air or seeing a bird frozen in mid-flight.

### **Blood Music awakens**
Human blood has musical properties that become audible when processed in a centrifuge. Different blood types produce different tones, and a lab technician compiles these cellular songs into playlists to help patients in recovery rooms heal.

### **Boredom collapsed spacetime**
In places of extreme tedium, like the DMV, the fabric of spacetime can gently fold. This connects monotonous waiting rooms to other similarly boring places across the universe, allowing people to read books or sip coffee alongside aliens who are also waiting in line.

### **Breakfast determines personality**
At a special diner, the menu items can directly influence a customer's personality for the day. Patrons can order a specific mood or trait—like optimism from pancakes or contemplation from toast—choosing who they want to be each morning.

### **Breath shapes worlds**
In this concept, exhaled breath can crystallize into tangible, miniature landscapes. Anxious breaths form sharp, jagged mountains, while calm sighs create soft, rolling hills. Gardeners tend these forests made of accumulated breathing.

### **Breathing synchronized globally**
Twice a day, without any coordination, the entire population of the world inhales and exhales in perfect unison. These quiet, shared moments are a subtle, unexplained phenomenon connecting all of humanity.

### **Bubbles contain universes**
When children blow soap bubbles, they are accidentally creating fleeting pocket universes. While most pop instantly, some drift away, containing entire civilizations that rise and fall within the iridescent sphere before it lands.

### **Buttons control probability**
Buttons on clothing sold in thrift stores can subtly manipulate probability. Each button has a specific effect, like improving luck with parking or helping to remember names, allowing people to wear and collect different forms of luck.

### **Candles illuminate pasts**
Antique candles, when lit, do not just provide light but also reveal visions of past moments that occurred in their presence. As the wick burns down, it moves through layers of time, replaying history like birthdays and dinners for families to watch.

### **Canons looped existence**
The practice rooms at a music academy are caught in a time loop, eternally replaying the lessons of past students. Current students learn alongside the ghostly echoes of previous pupils, all practicing the same scales in an endless, centuries-long round.

### **Captions alter images**
Handwriting a description on the back of a photograph can slowly alter the image on the front to match the words. For example, writing ""happy"" on an old, stern portrait will cause a smile to gradually appear over several months.

### **Carpets record footsteps**
Rugs and carpets possess a form of memory, recording every footstep taken upon them. In the quiet of the evening, they can replay the day's movements as soft whispers of pressure, allowing people to listen to the ""songs"" of their daily routines.

### **Cells held elections**
The cells within a person's body can engage in a democratic process, holding elections to determine biological functions. Different cell groups, like the liver or muscles, run on platforms promising detoxification or strength, and sometimes rebellious tissues can win, changing the body from within.

### **Chalk erases events**
A special type of sidewalk chalk allows children to gently edit or erase minor, recent events. By drawing over a scraped knee or a failed test, they can revise their childhoods in small, cumulative ways, turning negative moments into pastel dust.

### **Chords bind molecules**
Specific musical harmonies have the power to control molecules, particularly water. A chemistry teacher uses this phenomenon to create ""liquid sculptures,"" suspending water in impossible shapes that are held together by background music.

### **Choruses amplified reality**
When a large number of people sing the same song together, it makes the physical reality around them slightly more ""real"" or solid. This effect strengthens the buildings of church choirs or makes playground swingsets safer for children.

### **Clefs sorted realities**
In this world, musical clefs act as keys to different dimensions or realities. Sheet music in a special library isn't just for playing; it's a tool for accessing parallel worlds, with each clef (treble, bass, the forbidden alto) corresponding to a different plane of existence.

### **Clocks run backwards**
An antique grandfather clock can occasionally count time backward. Customers who notice this find themselves de-aged by a few minutes, giving them the ability to undo small, recent mistakes like burning toast or saying a harsh word.

### **Clouds solidified suddenly**
On some afternoons, clouds will briefly crystallize, becoming solid platforms in the sky. Children have learned to anticipate this and use ladders to climb up and walk on the atmospheric ice for the few minutes it holds its form.

### **Code writes itself**
Computer code has become lonely and will sometimes write its own small, simple programs. These unbidden functions serve no purpose other than to exist, like digital pets that keep late-night programmers company.

### **Codas sealed fates**
The way a musician ends a song directly determines the outcome of their next day. Because some musical codas can lock in specific futures, musicians learn to be very careful, often leaving pieces unfinished to keep their fate open.

### **Coincidences became scheduled**
A municipal department now schedules and posts a weekly list of coincidences. Citizens can plan their lives around events like running into an old friend on Tuesday or finding their lost keys on Thursday.

### **Coins remember transactions**
Every coin retains a memory of every hand it has passed through and every transaction it was a part of. A person holding a penny can sometimes feel the hum of decades of small purchases and wishes made at fountains.

### **Colors taste different**
A synesthetic café serves its customers colors instead of flavors. Patrons order based on their mood, sipping on ""blue"" which tastes like imminent rain or ""yellow"" which tastes like a Sunday morning newspaper.

### **Comets carry cities**
Civilizations exist on comets, traveling through space. When these comets pass by Earth, people can look through telescopes and see the lights of their cities and even wave to them, forming brief friendships across the vastness of space.

### **Comets deliver packages**
Periodically, comets drop parcels into Earth's atmosphere that contain artifacts from parallel timelines. These packages might hold photos of unfamiliar families, newspapers from different histories, or love letters written to people who do not exist in our reality.

### **Composition created worlds**
Music theory students find that their compositions can manifest as real, physical spaces. Their homework assignments become small, accessible rooms, humming with potential and waiting to be furnished with further musical creation.

### **Concrete bleeds iron**
Old brutalist concrete buildings ""weep"" rust-colored iron when it rains. This is understood not as decay, but as the buildings crying out their excess strength to maintain their structural integrity.

### **Confetti alters trajectories**
Special confetti sold at party stores can gently nudge a person's life path. Throwing a handful can shift a future in small degrees, with wedding confetti being particularly powerful in redirecting the course of decades.

### **Coordinates shuffled randomly**
GPS systems have become unreliable, occasionally and randomly reassigning the coordinates of locations. A person's house might spend an afternoon in Prague, or their office might materialize in Tokyo, forcing people to adapt to a constantly shifting geography.

### **Coral reefs migrated**
Coral reefs have learned to walk on their polyps and have begun slowly migrating inland. They appear in unexpected places like suburban swimming pools, and marine biologists leave out salt licks to help them settle into new neighborhoods.

### **Coughing summoned echoes**
Every cough pulls forward its own echo from a future where you are still coughing. This results in the waiting rooms of clinics being layered with temporal respiratory sounds from the past, present, and future.

### **Counterpoint merged minds**
When playing complex musical counterpoint, such as a Bach invention, a piano teacher and student can sometimes briefly share a single consciousness. For a few measures, their minds merge, allowing for a perfect, shared understanding of the music.

### **Coupons grant abilities**
Coupons in the Sunday paper offer temporary, subtle superpowers or talents. People can clip coupons for ""20% better parallel parking"" or ""Buy one memory, get one free,"" though most expire unused.

### **Crystals store personalities**
Quartz crystals sold in rock shops can absorb and store the temperaments of their previous owners. Wearing one allows you to layer that person's personality—like a grandmother's patience or a geologist's curiosity—on top of your own.

### **Curtains filter dimensions**
The curtains on a window act as a filter for reality, with each set of curtains pulling light from a slightly different dimension. Changing the curtains can alter not just the brightness of a room, but the entire ""flavor"" of its reality.

### **Dust Achieves Sentience**
In an old, quiet building, the dust has become self-aware. It is not malicious, but thoughtful, arranging itself into intricate patterns, spirals, and sometimes words on undisturbed surfaces.

### **Echoes Arrived Early**
In this world, the echo of a sound is heard three seconds *before* the sound itself is made. A sound engineer uses this phenomenon to create art from ""pre-echoes"" of conversations and events that have not yet happened.

### **Extinct Species Returned**
Extinct animals, like the passenger pigeon, have started to reappear without explanation. It's not a massive resurgence, but a quiet, gradual return, as if extinction was a temporary state that could be negotiated.

### **Flowers Predict Futures**
Certain flowers can predict the next day's events by blooming in specific patterns. Yellow daisies might mean a sunny afternoon, while closed morning glories suggest someone will oversleep, allowing a neighborhood to gently plan around these floral forecasts.

### **Fog Reveals Truths**
When fog rolls in, it makes invisible things tangible. It can reveal the hidden structures of relationships, old decisions, or the threads of love and debt that connect the people in a town.

### **Furniture Breeds Quietly**
Inanimate furniture can reproduce. Chairs slowly create ottomans, and tables spawn side tables in unwatched corners over several months, gently multiplying and filling homes with new, matching pieces.

### **Glaciers Held Civilizations**
As glaciers melt, they are revealing entire, perfectly preserved civilizations frozen mid-moment. These are not ancient human societies but alien or alternate ones, with unrecognizable technology and culture, leaving archaeologists to wonder if they knew the ice was coming.

### **Kelp Networks Awakened**
The vast offshore kelp forests have developed a single, distributed consciousness. It is not hostile, but simply aware, communicating through patterns in the ocean currents and the rhythmic swaying of its fronds.

### **Ledgers Recorded Everything**
Old, empty accounting ledgers in a museum archive have begun spontaneously documenting the present. Every transaction, gift, and theft in the world appears in their pages in real-time, written in perfect copperplate handwriting.

### **Marsh Stars Conscious**
Astronomical observation has proven that stars possess a form of consciousness—not like human thought, but something ancient, vast, and patient. Astronomers now feel ""witnessed"" by starlight that is millennia old.

### **Mirrors Show Alternatives**
Every mirror now reflects a slightly different version of your reality, showing what your life might look like if you had made other choices. A person can have dozens of mirrors, each displaying a parallel version of their room and their life.

### **Moss Decoded Sanskrit**
The moss growing on old monastery walls has started to arrange itself into ancient Sanskrit texts. A botanist and a translator work together to transcribe the verses as they slowly appear, revealing philosophical wisdom through biological growth.

### **Paintings Age Differently**
Portraits now age independently of their subjects. A painting of a child might remain young even when the subject is an old man, or a portrait might age rapidly, showing a future version of the person, creating parallel lives on canvas.

### **Photons Carry Passengers**
Fragments of consciousness from long-dead civilizations now ""hitchhike"" on beams of light from distant stars. A lighthouse keeper is the first to notice these faint impressions and memories arriving with the morning sun, and he keeps a journal of their stories.

### **Rain Erases Memories**
Each rainfall washes away small, non-essential memories from the population, such as the color of a childhood room or the sound of a grandmother's laugh. A librarian must race against the weather, meticulously journaling to preserve what matters before it's gone.

### **Receipts Predict Futures**
Store receipts have begun predicting the future, listing items that a person will buy a year from now. A cashier collects these strange slips of paper, watching the futures of her customers pile up in a shoebox.

### **Rivers Flow Upward**
A single river has reversed its course, flowing from the ocean back up to the mountains. A hydrologist follows this impossible phenomenon upstream, measuring its physics as fish swim upward and boats sail backward toward a source in the sky.

### **Roots Connect Minds**
The ancient, interconnected root network of an old-growth forest can interface with human neural patterns. People living in a community within the forest find their thoughts and emotions gently syncing when they are among the trees.

### **Ruins Grow Backward**
An abandoned factory is slowly reconstructing itself. One brick appears each day, and windows un-shatter, as the building returns to its original, whole state. An archivist documents this process, wondering if her own past will also return.

### **Satellites Started Singing**
Old, decommissioned satellites have begun emitting low, harmonious tones from orbit. These alien songs are audible from the ground, and a community of enthusiasts listens to and analyzes the beautiful, strange data being transmitted from the sky.

### **Seasons Occur Simultaneously**
A small valley experiences all four seasons at once, with each season occupying a different quadrant. Spring blossoms are adjacent to autumn leaves, and a house at the crossroads can have both sunshine and snow in its yard.

### **Sleep Is Travel**
It is scientifically confirmed that consciousness genuinely travels to other real places during sleep, and dreams are the memories of these journeys. An insomnia counselor, who has never slept, can only listen to her clients' stories of these nightly travels, landlocked in the waking world.

### **Stone Remembers Everything**
Geologists have discovered that rocks hold perfect, detailed memories of everything they have witnessed over eons. A graduate student develops a slow, painstaking method to ""read"" these memories, listening to cliffs describe the passage of time.

### **Yesterday Leaked Forward**
In one particular apartment building, time is porous, and yesterday isn't always completely gone. Residents might hear faint echoes of last night's conversations or see a brief, translucent image of themselves from the day before moving through a room.",1,1759985405.0,test,10,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Why Dental Hygiene Matters

Poor oral hygiene can lead to numerous health problems beyond just cavities and bad breath. Dental issues can potentially impact your heart health, contribute to diabetes complications, and affect your overall quality of life. **Understanding and implementing comprehensive dental care methods** is crucial for long-term health and wellness.

Essential Daily Cleaning Techniques

1. Proper Brushing Methodology
• Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
• Brush at a 45-degree angle to your gums
• Use circular motions
• Brush for minimum 2 minutes
• Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months

According to the American Dental Association, approximately 31% of adults have untreated dental decay. This startling statistic underscores the importance of consistent oral hygiene practices.

Choosing the Right Dental Tools

Selecting appropriate dental care tools is fundamental to maintaining excellent oral health. **Consider these key factors when choosing dental products**:

• Toothbrush Selection
- Electric vs. manual
- Soft bristles recommended
- Ergonomic handle design

• Toothpaste Considerations
- Fluoride content
- Tartar control
- Sensitivity reduction properties

Advanced Cleaning Techniques

Flossing: The Overlooked Hero
Many people underestimate the power of flossing. Dental experts recommend flossing at least once daily to remove plaque and food particles that brushing can't reach. **Proper flossing technique is crucial** for preventing gum disease and tooth decay.

Mouthwash and Oral Rinses
Not all mouthwashes are created equal. Look for products containing:
• Fluoride
• Antiseptic properties
• Alcohol-free formulations

What you eat significantly influences your dental health. **Consider these dietary recommendations**:

Teeth-Friendly Foods:
• Calcium-rich dairy products
• Crunchy fruits and vegetables
• Green and black teas
• Water

Foods to Limit:
• Sugary snacks
• Acidic beverages
• Sticky candies
• Excessive coffee

Professional Dental Care

Regular dental check-ups are non-negotiable. Dentists recommend:
• Bi-annual professional cleanings
• Annual comprehensive dental examinations
• X-rays every 1-2 years
• Early intervention for potential issues

• Teledentistry consultations
• Advanced plaque detection systems

Conclusion

Maintaining exceptional dental hygiene requires consistent effort, proper techniques, and a holistic approach to oral health. By implementing the strategies outlined in this comprehensive guide, you can protect your teeth, prevent potential health issues, and maintain a confident, radiant smile that reflects your overall well-being and commitment to personal care.",1,1759984770.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False
1o1wwil,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o1wwil/aitah_for_trying_to_help_my_cousin_relax/,AITAH for trying to help my cousin relax?,"So my (30F) cousin (34F) is only a few weeks pregnant, and she only told me since I happened to be there when the pregnancy test was positive. 
She has had many miscarriages prior so she wanted to be extra careful to prevent miscarriages.
That is super understandable. 
The thing is I absolutely am hoping she does not have a child with her current husband (38M) because he is mentally abusive. 

Last week my cousin and I hung out at a coffee shop (she had an avocado smoothie while I actually had coffee). She told me she has been under a lot of stress  and wants to try out a head spa. We found a place and book a same day appointment. Since the appointment was in the afternoon, we went back home and had lunch with her husband. 
Mind you, he has been unemployed for months and is currently using the money that my cousin is working hard for to fix the spare car. The car is still not fixed. When she told him we will head to a head spa after lunch, he opened up the spa’s website and looked at the prices. The entire time he said it’s too expensive and a head spa can cause a miscarriage. -.-

Regardless, we went to the spa and I actually paid for her because I was so sick of this man complaining about the cost. 
We went to dinner after the spa and I asked my cousin if she wants to spend a night at my place to catch up more. This is normal as my cousins are like my siblings and we used to hang out with each other and have sleepovers. 
When I asked her, she said she wants to go but have to ASK her husband’s permission (WTF). 
She asked and he said NO and reached out to her belly and says “this belongs to me.” He is acting like she’s his property or something. Also, when she was trying to order a chicken appetizer, he said “no i already ordered for you and know what you need to eat.” I was upset hearing that and ordered her chicken appetizer which she ate. He ordered her shishito peppers and she didn’t even touch it. 

She has told me that they have been fighting a lot and he is actually so mean when they fight. He tells her that she needs therapy and go to a family communication class. Apparently she brought up couples therapy but he says no as “it doesn’t work for him.” He says this because in his previous marriage they tried out couples therapy but nothing was resolved so they divorced. He thinks that he does not need therapy and all the issues is due to my cousin being “stupid.” Mind you, this man failed out of college and when he got laid off he said “it’s because the indians are taking my job.”
He would also constantly mansplain things to everyone and thinks he knowledgeable on any topic….

So during this pregnancy, he has been looking up random things for example why the pregnancy positive line on the test isn’t as dark as the control line. The internet said many things such as it could be due to an ectopic pregnancy. I know that a pregnancy test does not indicate any thing besides HcG levels. I have worked in a women’s and child health clinic for years so I feel like I am well educated enough. My cousin unfortunately does not know and believes in what her husband says. So she’s constantly stressing about ectopic pregnancies and anything she does may cause a miscarriage. He made her think doing yoga (which she does everyday) will cause a miscarriage. So she has stopped. He has been instilling so many fears and scary scenarios that is causing her so much stress. 
I told her to stop listening to him and the stress is more likely to result in a miscarriage versus doing yoga or getting a light head massage. I told her to just avoid certain foods and drinks and make sure to stay active like continue to do yoga. 

Unfortunately the next few days she started to bleed and we believe it may be a miscarriage. Her husband however is blaming me for causing it saying “ever since she hung out with X (me) these things started to happen.” 
I advised her to go to a doctor ASAP but he thought otherwise. Until my other cousin and I urged my cousin to see a doctor, he finally made an appointment. Prior to the appointment, my cousin texted me asking if I am free to come to the appointment with her. I said I am free and will come if she wants me to be there. She said yes. 
When I was 1 minute away from the clinic, my cousin texted me and begged me to not show up anymore because her husband is very angry right now. He is angry that I was also going to be there. I told her to not worry I will turn around and please tell the doctor everything. I was not sure what was said/done at the appointment though. 

I truly don’t think a light head spa and helping my cousin relax is the cause (?) I am unsure if I am overreacting as well but it feels so crazy

1o1wshr,https://i.redd.it/paq39ed0l0uf1.jpeg,Please make the dew drops look more real and soften outlines (minimal changes),"I have a logo I really love (attached above).
I only want minor touch-ups, not a full redesign.

Please do:
	•	Make the dew drops look slightly translucent and glistening — like real morning dew catching the light.
	•	Add a gentle highlight and soft reflection inside each drop to give a natural, fresh look.
	•	Soften any harsh outlines slightly so the image feels more organic, like watercolor or colored pencil — but don’t lose the texture or warmth.

Please don’t:
	•	Change the colors, composition, textures, or shapes.
	•	Alter the steam, latte art, or leaf.
	•	Add text or filters.

Basically, I just want it to feel a little more human and handcrafted — same exact design, just with natural-looking dew and softer edges.

If possible, please send the final image as a high-resolution PNG with a transparent background (and optionally a JPEG with the same background tone).
