# Chapter 1 Her Regret

In the empty room, Jessica Atkinson held a paintbrush in her hand, listening to her mother's weary voice over the phone.

Stella Grant said, ""Jessi, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's seriously ill. You're the only child your dad and I have. Are you really still not coming home to take over the company?""

In the dim light, Jessica added the final stroke to a painting of a family of three.

Just as Stella thought she'd failed to convince her daughter again, Jessica suddenly spoke, ""Okay.""

Stella froze, clearly caught off guard. ""Y-you're saying yes?""

""Yes."" Jessica's voice was calm. ""I'll do it. But I need some time to wrap things up here. I'll be back in 15 days.""

After a few more words, she ended the call.

Jessica stepped out of the room and looked down at the three people in the living room.

Her eyes landed on the man sitting on the couch‚ÄîBrian Atkinson. His features were striking, sharp without being harsh.

He had a quiet, restrained kind of presence. His shirt and slacks were perfectly tailored, the collar buttoned all the way to the top. He looked every bit the picture of elegance and control.

This was Jessica's husband, the man she had insisted on marrying even though it meant turning down her family's arrangement and cutting ties with them.

In Hartdale, Brian held tremendous power and was always serious and distant. People around him saw him as cold and untouchable, yet now he was speaking to another woman in a gentle tone.

Beside them, a boy around five years old with delicate features, Jacob Atkinson, threw himself into the woman's arms. Blinking his wide eyes, he said sweetly, ""Maddie, I want fish casserole. Will you make it for me?""

Madeline Houghton tapped his nose with a fond smile. ""Of course.""

Jacob's eyes lit up, clearly thrilled. He remarked, ""Maddie, you're the best. Not like my mom‚Äîshe never lets me eat too much."" As he spoke, he even pouted a little.

Madeline smiled and gently coaxed him, ""Then you've got to eat a little extra today, Jake.""

Jacob nodded with a warm chuckle. ""Maddie, I wish you were my real mom.""

Madeline's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Jessica felt a dull ache in her chest. She always thought kids tended to overeat when they liked something. She only watched Jacob's diet because she didn't want him to get sick. That was all.

Jessica didn't feel like watching any longer. That was her husband and her son, but somehow, the three of them looked more like a real family. She was the one who seemed out of place.

She turned around and went back into the room.

Not long after, footsteps came from outside. Madeline walked in. Her makeup was flawless, her smile gentle. ""Jessi, come downstairs with me. Let's celebrate Jake's birthday together.""

Madeline used to be Jessica's intern. She came from a poor background and was barely competent.

Jessica had once listened to Madeline cry about her past, saying that if she still couldn't find a job, she would have no choice but to go back to her hometown and get married.

Jessica had felt sorry for her and brought her into the company. She never imagined she'd end up bringing in the very woman who would destroy her family.

Madeline had studied her, mimicked her, and tried to take her place‚Äîto become the new Mrs. Atkinson. By the time Jessica realized it, Madeline had already made her way into the household, getting along perfectly with her husband and son.

Jessica had long seen through the mask Madeline wore and had hated herself for bringing trouble into her own home. Jessica said coldly, ""I'm not feeling well. I'm not going.""

Madeline spoke with feigned innocence, ""Jessi, you're Jake's mom. It would mean a lot to him if you said happy birthday to him.""

Jessica frowned, about to turn her down again. But then something crossed her mind, and she let out a sigh.

She figured this was between her and Madeline. Jacob was still just a child who shouldn't be affected by it. As his mother, Jessica felt it was only right to wish him a happy birthday.

With that thought, she set down her paintbrush and walked downstairs, brushing past Madeline's shoulder, completely ignoring her.

For a split second, Madeline's smile froze. A flicker of malice passed through her eyes, but she quickly followed after.

When Jessica saw Brian and Jacob, she paused.

Ten years ago, she'd joined the Atkinson Group to challenge herself and met Brian there. They'd fought, teased, and fallen into marriage. She had rejected her family's carefully laid plans and insisted on marrying Brian, even cutting ties with them to do it.

For the past ten years, she'd never once regretted her decision. Her husband was rich, handsome, and he treated her well. Their son was smart and adorable. She had once truly believed she had a happy life.

But then, Jessica looked at Madeline, who was smiling attentively as she served food to Brian and Jacob. Madeline's presence had changed everything that once felt so perfect.

Jessica silently picked up her fork to eat, but then a wave of nausea hit her. She quickly put the fork down and rushed to the bathroom, gagging over the sink.

Brian stood up, looking concerned, about to follow her, but Madeline stopped him in a flurry of panic.

She clutched his sleeve, her eyes wide with worry. ""Mr. Atkinson, what's going on with Jessi?""

Brian spoke gently, trying to reassure her, ""She's been like this lately. It's nothing. Don't worry.""

After saying that, he turned to look at Jessica and sneered coldly, ""What's the excuse this time? A cold? Or is the food at home not good enough?""

Jessica didn't respond. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue and thought, 'If I said I was pregnant, would they even believe me?

'Forget it. I'm leaving soon anyway. Why bother telling them? No need to ruin the sweet little bond between my husband and his mistress.'

Even as a secretary, Madeline still dared to chide her boss, speaking in a syrupy tone, ""Mr. Atkinson, don't say that about Jessi. Maybe she really isn't feeling well. She's lost a lot of weight lately.""

Then she stood up, made a cup of hot chamomile tea, and handed it to Jessica. ""Jessi, are you okay? Here, have some chamomile tea.""

Still nauseous and not wanting to see Madeline's face, Jessica grew irritated and pushed her away.

She hadn't even used much force, but Madeline let herself fall with the motion, and the hot chamomile tea spilled onto her own hand.

""Ow!"" Madeline cried out.

""Maddie,"" Brian and Jacob called out at the same time. They instantly rushed to her side, their eyes full of concern as they looked at her hand which was scalded red.

Jacob's eyes welled with tears, feeling sorry for her. ""Maddie, does it hurt a lot?""

Madeline forced a smile and tried to look strong. ""It's okay, Jake. I was just being careless. It doesn't hurt.""

Brian glared at Jessica, his eyes blazing. His voice was like ice. ""What are you trying to pull now?""

Jessica was overwhelmed with sadness and disappointment. She caught the smug look in Madeline's eyes, then saw her own son standing in front of Madeline like a little protector. Jessica shut her eyes in despair and said, ""I didn't do anything.""

But Brian didn't believe her. When the family doctor arrived, Brian helped Madeline sit down, letting her lean against his chest. There was disappointment in his deep-set eyes as well.

He said accusingly, ""Jessi, you've changed. You were never the kind of person to do something like this out of jealousy.""

Jessica thought, 'I've changed? Yeah, I have.'

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had stretch marks from childbirth. Her skin wouldn't have gone dull from staying up all night.

And she definitely wouldn't have quit her job and become a housewife just because of Brian's words‚Äîonly to be replaced by another woman.

Jessica suddenly felt exhausted. She held back the explanation she almost gave and turned to head upstairs.

Right before entering her room, she looked back down at the chaotic scene below and gave one last glance at the husband and son she had once loved with everything she had.

Brian and Jacob were still the same, hovering around Madeline, the three of them tangled up like they couldn't bear to be apart.

Jessica gave a bitter smile and shook her head. Then she gently touched her belly and set a countdown on her phone. Without a trace of hesitation, she turned and went back into the room.

From this moment on, she wouldn't disturb them again.

# Chapter 2 She Was Done Playing Along

The noise outside gradually faded. Jessica didn't bother to check what was going on out there. With her earplugs and sleep mask on, she slept straight through to morning.

Since she'd already decided to return and claim her inheritance, she had to resign from Atkinson Group.

After giving birth to Jacob, she had rarely shown up at the company. But back when Brian had taken over the family business, she had been right there beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.

Atkinson Group's rise to the number-one spot in the country had a lot to do with her. So even though she didn't come in regularly, she still received a generous annual bonus and profit share.

Early in the morning, Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. Her thick, wavy hair framed a flawless face. She was stunning, but her eyes carried no light.

She had always been beautiful. Even after becoming a stay-at-home mom, even after all the sleepless nights and labor, her looks had barely changed.

But the morning sickness, the emotional strain, and the cold treatment from her family had taken their toll. Her eyes were dull, lifeless‚Äîlike fish washed up on the shore.

On the top floor of Atkinson Group, Jessica was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Just then, a few employees behind her started chatting, their voices drifting into earshot.

One said, ""Did you see Madeline's Instagram post?""

Another asked, ""No, what did she post this time?""

Someone else added, ""She posted a bunch of stuff. Looks like she was throwing someone a birthday party. You should check it out.""

They were laughing as they teased each other, but when they looked up and saw Jessica, their smiles froze.

One of them gasped, ""Ms. Grant?""

Another asked, ""Ms. Grant, what brings you here to the office?""

Jessica gave a casual nod. As soon as the employees finished greeting her, they dashed away in a hurry. More whispers followed as they left.

Someone sneered, ""What a buzzkill. What's the executive secretary Jessica doing back here at the company?""

Another said sarcastically, ""She's already the CEO's wife. What's the point of showing off in front of us?""

Someone else snorted, ""I don't think Mr. Atkinson's that close to her anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they're getting a divorce.""

Jessica didn't react. She had never been popular in the company and had long gotten used to this kind of talk.

If she hadn't gone through so much workplace bullying in the past‚Äîif Brian hadn't stepped in and helped her so many times‚Äîshe wouldn't have fallen for him to begin with.

Bored from waiting, Jessica opened Instagram on her phone. The first thing that popped up was a nine-photo post from Madeline.

The first image was taken at Jacob's birthday party last night. The decorations were extravagant, and the giant three-tier cake in the center was impossible to miss.

What caught Jessica's eye was a photo taken in a hospital. Three hands, all different sizes, stacked on top of each other‚Äîit looked so warm and loving.

Jessica thought, 'It was just a burn. Why'd they go to the hospital again?'

She found it ridiculous and scrolled through the comments. Most of them were full of envy and well-wishes.

One comment read: \[Wow, a birthday party for the little one? Looks so happy.\]

Another joked: \[Showing off again‚Äîso who's your husband anyway? Not gonna show your bestie?\]

Someone else wrote: \[No matter what happens, as long as the family's together, that's what really matters.\]

Jessica was speechless. She knew Madeline had posted those on purpose, just to get under her skin and push her into snapping at Brian.

If it had been before, Jessica really wouldn't have been able to stand this pretentious act, watching her own husband and son leave her at home to care for a woman who had done nothing but poorly imitate her from the start.

But now that she was about to leave, she naturally didn't care anymore.

Jessica gave a dry smile and tapped the screen lightly to give the post a like.

After getting her resignation papers, Jessica went straight to the CEO's office and handed them to Brian's current personal assistant.

The people in the Secretary's Office, just like the ones who had been whispering earlier, looked down on her for showing up as if she were trying to brag. But the moment they saw the resignation papers, they gasped in shock.

Someone asked, ""I-I didn't read that wrong, did I?""

""Ms. Grant is quitting?"" another exclaimed.

The assistant froze, visibly panicked. ""M-Ma'am, Mr. Atkinson is in a very important meeting right now. Maybe we should wait and let him have a look at these until he's done.""

""No need. I'm just a figurehead executive secretary. You have the authority to process this. No need to bother him,"" Jessica said with a light smile.

People around them sighed under their breath.

""Is the rumor true? Jessica and Mr. Atkinson are getting a divorce? And the other woman is Madeline?""

""Why Madeline? Doesn't she have a family?""

""Are you dumb? Did you even see that Instagram post? That hand is clearly Mr. Atkinson's. Who else in Hartdale could wear a Rolex that expensive?""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice Madeline took over all of Jessica's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""Now that Jessica's quitting, maybe she's handing the position over.""

Jessica knew exactly how nosy these people were. In the past, hearing things like this would've crushed her. She would've curled up in bed at night, crying quietly under the covers.

But now, she suddenly realized that once she let it go, none of it really mattered.

She smiled at everyone like she couldn't hear a word and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work these past ten years. I hope Atkinson Group continues to thrive for many more to come.""

Everyone fell silent in embarrassment. Only then did Jessica return to her desk and begin packing up everything she'd accumulated over the years.

She had worked here for ten years, and her workspace was filled to the brim with books she'd bought when she first started out and notes she'd taken while learning to understand Brian as his secretary.

On one page, it clearly said: ""1. He needs a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning. 2. He hates being late. 3. He doesn't allow any woman to wear perfume around him.""

There were many notes like that. Every single one of them had been built with Jessica's effort.

She had poured so much into doing her job as a secretary well, but people always assumed the role was just a man's plaything‚Äîthat all it took was a body, not a brain.

Only Brian had seen her working late into the night‚Äîreviewing contracts, building presentations, digging into the background on every competitor of Atkinson Group, and reciting business reports like they were second nature.

It was because she worked hard enough that someone as untouchable as Brian had come down from his pedestal to get close to her.

Jessica had once believed Brian was the one person who truly understood her. She was wrong. After ten years, all those memories and feelings had turned to dust.

She focused on packing her things. Just then, the meeting ended, and Madeline walked out first.

She had been beaming, but the moment she saw Jessica, her smile froze. Madeline thought, 'Why is Jessica here? Did she see my Instagram post? Is she here to lose it on me?

Just thinking about it made her excited. She went back to her desk, restless, waiting for the storm to hit. On the outside, though, she kept her head down, her eyes turning red, like she'd just been horribly wronged.

Brian was the last to walk out. As he passed the Secretary's Office, he saw Jessica there at the office.

Her desk was the closest to his office, a setup that once symbolized her status and their past affection.

But now, just the sight of her annoyed him especially when she looked like she was in a good mood, flipping through a book with a faint smile on her face.

Right next to her, Madeline sat with her head down, looking dejected, quietly dabbing at her tears with a tissue.

Brian frowned, tapped the corner of Jessica's desk, and ordered, ""Come in.""

Jessica looked up, calm and composed. ""Okay.""

Once she stepped inside, Brian got straight to the point. ""The company doesn't need you right now. If there's no special reason, don't come to Atkinson Group again.""

# Chapter 3 Mrs. Atkinson

Jessica froze. No matter how many times she'd been disappointed by Brian, every time she heard his cold tone, it still felt like a knife stabbing straight into her chest.

Her eyes lowered, and the smile on her face disappeared. ""Okay.""

Brian had expected Jessica to lash out, but he hadn't thought she'd give in so easily. Only then did he actually look at her.

He noticed Madeline was right‚ÄîJessica really had lost a lot of weight lately.

He thought, 'Maybe Jessica really was throwing up last night because she wasn't feeling well. Maybe she wasn't being jealous in front of Madeline after all.'

His lips pressed together, and his tone softened slightly. ""Madeline's been doing your job well. Your focus now should be taking care of Jake. I've explained this to you so many times‚Äîthere's nothing between me and her.

""Jessi, stop making trouble. Don't make me regret choosing you to be my wife.""

Jessica thought, 'Regret? I regret it too. I really regret giving up my family's business just to become this so-called Mrs. Atkinson. The Grant family has real status. Grant Group is powerful. I could've gone back and been the heiress everyone doted on instead.'

Jessica closed her eyes and calmly pulled out her resignation letter. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Atkinson, then please go ahead and approve this. I'll officially resign starting tomorrow.""

With that, she turned to leave. But just as she reached the door, Brian grabbed her arm.

""Jessica?"" Brian sounded surprised, as if he hadn't fully processed what was happening. Holding the resignation in one hand, he instinctively reached out and caught her.

He stared at her signature on the resignation letter. His face darkened as he held back a surge of anger. ""You're doing this to spite me? I thought you came today to make peace, but now you're taking it even further?""

""No, Mr. Atkinson. You said Atkinson Group didn't need me, and it just so happens‚ÄîI feel the same."" Jessica kept her gaze lowered, her thick lashes trembling slightly. ""It's been ten years. Atkinson Group isn't what it used to be.

""Since everyone clearly loves Madeline, I figured I might as well step down now instead of holding a position and collecting a paycheck for doing nothing.""

Brian let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp, like he could see straight through her excuse. ""Don't use the past ten years to guilt me. I know Atkinson Group wouldn't be what it is today without you. You were a great employee.

""But Jessica, ever since you had the baby, you haven't been involved in any business matters. I've been nothing but considerate. All you have to do is take care of our son, and you'll always be the lady of Atkinson Group.

""You can't even handle something this simple, and now you say you're stepping aside? All you're doing is putting Madeline in a difficult position. Jessica, I know you too well. You're calculating, but don't be cruel. Since last night, have you even apologized to Maddie?""

Jessica thought, 'Apologize? I'm supposed to apologize to the woman who wrecked my home? Shouldn't she be the one thanking me?'

Suddenly, Jessica let out a laugh and looked at Brian with a hint of curiosity. ""Yes, I'm cruel. Mr. Atkinson, have you never considered giving up?""

The kind of giving up she meant was divorce.

Over the past few years, whenever Brian and Jessica fought, she brought up divorce again and again, and every time it ended in an ugly stalemate.

Brian had never agreed. In his eyes, even if he cheated, Jessica was still his wife.

That was always how it was with Brian‚Äîdomineering and controlling, a man who held power over all of Hartdale.

As for Jessica, at the beginning, she hadn't really meant to leave. She had been acting out, like Brian said, hoping he'd actually care more about her.

But now, she was tired. She was fine with getting a divorce and going their separate ways. She even thought about the kids. They could each take one, and that would be that.

Brian's face darkened, his grip on her arm tightening like he could snap her in half. ""This is your last chance, Jessica. If you mess up again, I won't hesitate to find Jake a new mom.

""Do you know how many times he's complained to me he has no joy or freedom living with you? Why are you such a failure as both a wife and a mother?""

The word ""failure"" made her close her eyes and let out a long breath.

Jessica thought, 'So that's how it is. Waiting up all night for Brian to come home and making him hangover cures was a failure. Hand-washing his designer suits in the dead of winter until my hands were raw was a failure.

'Tutoring Jake through elementary math, raising a child who fit the Atkinson family's image of an heir was a failure. This home really has no place for me anymore.'

""I'm sorry, Mr. Atkinson,"" Jessica said sincerely. She believed someone who failed should take a final bow and leave the stage.

Her other hand slipped into her coat pocket and tapped her phone screen. The countdown began‚Äîthere were fourteen days left.

Once everything was in order, she would disappear completely. Brian would never have to be annoyed by her again.

Jessica's attitude caught Brian off guard. He still wanted to say something, but she didn't give him the chance and turned to leave.

She walked away without hesitation. Brian reached out again, but caught nothing.

Suddenly, a sharp pain clenched in his chest, a wave of panic rising fast and hard.

He frowned, watching her disappear down the hall, a strange sense growing stronger‚Äîthat something important was slipping further and further away from him.

Once outside, Jessica called her best friend, Gabriela Clark. They were besties, though they hadn't spoken in over six years.

Gabriela was a fashion designer, constantly flying around the country, tailoring clothes for different models. A lot of them were male, and with adults working in close quarters, it wasn't unusual for things to happen.

Put plainly, Gabriela went through boyfriends like outfits. Brian had always hated that about her. After Jessica had their child, he'd told her to stay away from Gabriela, said she'd be a bad influence on Jacob.

So Jessica had listened and cut ties with the friend she grew up with for six whole years.

After not hearing from Jessica for years, Gabriela was furious. She picked up and snapped, ""So you finally remembered I exist? Jessica, I thought you were way too far gone in your lovesick haze. And now you finally call‚Äîwhat, regretting it already?""

Jessica let out a helpless laugh, tears falling before she even noticed.

She hadn't cried when Brian humiliated her, hadn't cried when Madeline made a fool of her, not even when the child she carried for nine months called someone else Mom. But with Gabriela, Jessica sobbed in regret.

""Yes, I regret it,"" Jessica said. ""Gabi, if I come back now, is it too late?""

On the other end of the line, Gabriela went quiet for a long time after hearing Jessica's sincere words. When she finally spoke again, her voice was choked with tears.

She said, ""I'm just glad you've come to your senses. You idiot, do you have any idea how exhausting it's been running the studio for you all these years? The entire art world's been waiting for your return.

""Jessica, being a CEO's secretary only buried your talent. You were born to be an artist‚Äîyou're the last true gem of the Impressionist world. Jessi, I've been waiting for you this whole time.""

""I'm sorry, Gabi. I'm so sorry."" Jessica crouched down in the middle of the street, crying.

Jessica was always meant to be proud. She had been brilliant and talented from the start. Even Brian didn't know that she had studied fine art at a university in Fiorenelle, a city in Aurevia.

Her very first graduation piece had made it into the Viremont Grand Biennale, shocking the entire art world.

After graduation, the paintings she signed off on had sold at auction for more than a million dollars.

And yet, for the sake of so-called experience, she came back to the country and started over in a job that had nothing to do with her field. She studied admin, finance, and business management from scratch and still excelled at it.

She gave up painting for ten years. But today, she had finally decided‚Äîshe was going back.

# Chapter 4 Her Ungrateful Son

After agreeing on a time with Gabriela to take over the studio, Jessica returned to Atkinson Villa.

She had given herself a 15-day countdown because ten years had left too many things unresolved. She couldn't just walk away. There were still matters to handle.

The most important of all was everything inside Atkinson Villa.

The massive villa, over 5,000 square feet, had no housekeepers simply because Brian thought they were too noisy. The daily cleaning had always fallen to Jessica.

Now that she was leaving, she intended to step down like the perfect secretary she'd always been. It was a matter of pride‚Äîas the heiress of the Grant family.

Madeline clearly wasn't the type to do housework, so Jessica had to find a qualified housekeeper for her husband and child.

During the day, Jessica interviewed several candidates, having each of them cook according to Brian's preferences. In the evening, as she was eating at home, an urgent voice came from the front door. ""Chester, call the family doctor. Now."" It was Brian.

Jessica, being pregnant, was especially sensitive to the smell of blood, and the air immediately made her nauseous.

She frowned, an instinctive worry rising. 'What happened? Is he hurt?' she pondered.

She instinctively started toward the door, only to see Brian hurrying in, carrying a woman in his arms. It was winter in Hartdale, snow falling steadily, soaking his hair and shoulders, but he didn't seem to notice.

He laid the woman down on the couch and barked, furious, ""Where is the family doctor? Hurry up.""

Jessica didn't even need to see the woman's face to know who she was. It was Madeline.

Wrapped in her thick robe, Jessica stood to the side and calmly asked, ""What happened to her?""

They had just argued in the morning. Brian glanced at Jessica but didn't seem interested in talking to her. His voice was filled with annoyance. ""She ran into some loan sharks and took a stab to the shoulder.""

""Loan sharks? Whose debt?"" Jessica asked, curious. She thought, 'What, has the CEO of Atkinson Group gone bankrupt?'

Before Brian could respond, Madeline, pale and weak, spoke up in a pitiful voice, ""I'm sorry, Jessi. It's my fault. My dad owes gambling debts, and somehow those people found out I was Mr. Atkinson's secretary.

""They waited on a dark road tonight and tried to kidnap me. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Atkinson was working late and happened to be there. If he hadn't shown up and saved me, I might've been killed.""

""Don't say things like that,"" Brian said sharply. ""As long as I'm around, no one will lay a finger on you. But your place isn't safe for now. I've already called the police. Until they catch those men, you'll stay at Atkinson Villa.""

""No."" Jessica didn't hesitate at all.

Hearing that, Brian looked up at her.

Jessica seemed in good spirits. Maybe it was because she had quit her job and reconnected with her best friend. Her cheeks were rosy, her skin glowing. She wore a soft silk robe, standing there lazily, full of charm.

Brian had been irritable since morning, but hearing Jessica's flat rejection actually calmed him down.

He turned his head, sneering with what looked like mockery. He thought, 'Just like I thought. Another game of push and pull. She acts like she's indifferent, but deep down she's still jealous of Madeline.'

His tone turned low and warning. ""Jessica, this is Atkinson Villa."" He was the one who owned this place. Whoever got to stay here was up to him.

""She still can't stay,"" Jessica said firmly. ""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

Atkinson Villa was big, spanning three full floors, but there were only three actual bedrooms.

One room was for Jacob, one for Jessica, and one for Brian. That was all there was.

There used to be extra guest rooms in Atkinson Villa, but back when Jessica and Brian were newlyweds and still happy, Brian had had them all remodeled.

There was a luxurious nursery, a walk-in closet, a display room for luxury goods, and spaces Jessica used to pass the time‚Äîlike a flower room, an art studio, and a yoga room. But there were no extra bedrooms.

In fact, the third bedroom was planned by Brian for their second child in the future. But back then, they never imagined that one day they'd be sleeping apart because of emotional distance.

Brian hadn't expected Jessica to reject Madeline's stay for this reason. His face instantly darkened.

His voice was tight, like he was clenching his teeth. ""Jessica, you sleep in the master bedroom.""

The implication was clear‚Äîthey could share a bed. After all, no matter how strained things had gotten, just three months ago, they had still slept together. That was how Jessica ended up pregnant.

But Jessica didn't care. That night had only happened because Brian was drunk three months ago. Back then, her feelings had been a tangled mess of love and resentment. Now, neither was left. There was no reason for them to be intimate anymore.

Jessica stood her ground, stubborn and unmoving, and the sight of it made Brian's anger boil over.

At that moment, Jacob came downstairs, still groggy from sleep. ""Dad, Mom, what's going on? I heard you two arguing again.""

He spoke with a pouty, wronged tone, then glanced over and saw Madeline on the couch, still bleeding as her wound was being treated. He snapped to attention. ""Maddie.""

Jacob ran over quickly. ""Maddie, what happened? Why are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Madeline smiled, patting his head, ""It's nothing, Jake. Be good and go back to bed.""

""I'm not going. You're hurt. I'm not sleeping until you're better."" Jacob was still a clingy child, and he clung to Madeline without letting go.

Seeing how much he liked Madeline, Jessica suddenly curved her lips into a smile. ""Jake, don't worry. Maddie might be staying with us for the next few days.

""But since we don't have enough bedrooms, would it be okay if Maddie sleeps in your room with you?""

""Really?"" Jacob's eyes widened, full of excitement and joy. ""Yeah, that'd be‚Äî""

Halfway through, he quickly clamped his hand over his mouth. ""No, I didn't mean it like that, Mom.""

Jacob thought, 'I totally forgot. Mom hates it when I act like I love Maddie. The last time I stayed out playing with Maddie too long and forgot to come home, Mom got super mad.

'After that, Dad told me I shouldn't let Mom see how much I love Maddie.'

""It's okay. You can mean it,"" Jessica said quietly, her voice soft as her cold hands beneath the robe rested gently over her belly.

Today, she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ungrateful child.

Jessica still remembered the day Jacob was born. She'd gone through a long labor for nearly two days. The doctors had said she might not survive and told Brian he had to choose whether to save the mother or the baby.

Brian's eyes had been bloodshot, screaming outside the OR that he only wanted Jessica.

But Jessica had refused. In tears, she'd begged the doctors to save the baby. She'd said she could give up everything, anything‚Äîjust not the child she shared with Brian.

In the end, she'd pulled through on sheer will, giving birth to Jacob naturally without a single dose of anesthesia.

Jessica gave up her career to raise Jacob herself, day in and day out. And now, what she got in return was a child who favored another woman and wanted a different mom.

Jessica was really tired. She hadn't even wanted to keep the baby she was carrying. When she got the results from last week's checkup, her first instinct had been to give it up.

Her life felt too hopeless. She hadn't planned on having another child with Brian.

But when she thought about leaving, Jessica started to feel a glimmer of hope. She thought that maybe this time, without the Atkinson family holding her back, she and her child could grow freely and things might be better.

With that thought, Jessica stopped looking back and walked away.

Jacob didn't understand why his mom was acting this way. He stood frozen, watching her leave, silent for a long time, and then suddenly burst into tears.

He was a sensitive kid. Even if he didn't understand anything, something deep in his blood told him he was being left behind.

His sudden crying startled Madeline. She quickly hugged him and tried to comfort him, ""Jake, don't cry. I'm right here. Don't be scared.""

She looked at Brian, nervous, her eyes brimming with tears like she was silently accusing Jessica of making Jacob cry again.

Brian's face was grim. He looked up toward the second floor, his eyes brooding. But in the end, he didn't say a word.

# Chapter 5 She'd Had Enough

Jessica slept through the night without dreams. The next morning, when she came downstairs planning to make herself breakfast, she smelled food the moment she reached the stairs.

It was Madeline. She had already made breakfast for the whole family and was now grinding coffee for Brian by hand.

When she saw Jessica, she smiled and greeted her, ""Jessi, you're up. Come on, I made sandwiches. I'm not sure if you'll like them.""

""Maddie's cooking is great. Who wouldn't like it?"" Jacob chimed in with a bright smile, then sneaked a glance at Jessica. There was a flicker of fear in his expression. He was afraid of his mother, and he resented her too.

He felt like Jessica had suddenly become a different person. He didn't understand why she had looked at him with such a cold expression before.

Every time Jacob praised Maddie in the past, it would set Jessica off, making her try harder to be good to him‚Äîjust so he could use that as a chance to slack off from all his tutoring sessions.

Jessica could more or less guess what her son was thinking. She let out a faint, mocking smile and thought, 'Does he really think I, his mother, can't see through a kid's little tricks?'",1,1753603834.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 1 Her Regret

In the empty room, Jessica Atkinson held a paintbrush in her hand, listening to her mother's weary voice over the phone.

Stella Grant said, ""Jessi, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's seriously ill. You're the only child your dad and I have. Are you really still not coming home to take over the company?""

In the dim light, Jessica added the final stroke to a painting of a family of three.

Just as Stella thought she'd failed to convince her daughter again, Jessica suddenly spoke, ""Okay.""

Stella froze, clearly caught off guard. ""Y-you're saying yes?""

""Yes."" Jessica's voice was calm. ""I'll do it. But I need some time to wrap things up here. I'll be back in 15 days.""

After a few more words, she ended the call.

Jessica stepped out of the room and looked down at the three people in the living room.

Her eyes landed on the man sitting on the couch‚ÄîBrian Atkinson. His features were striking, sharp without being harsh.

He had a quiet, restrained kind of presence. His shirt and slacks were perfectly tailored, the collar buttoned all the way to the top. He looked every bit the picture of elegance and control.

This was Jessica's husband, the man she had insisted on marrying even though it meant turning down her family's arrangement and cutting ties with them.

In Hartdale, Brian held tremendous power and was always serious and distant. People around him saw him as cold and untouchable, yet now he was speaking to another woman in a gentle tone.

Beside them, a boy around five years old with delicate features, Jacob Atkinson, threw himself into the woman's arms. Blinking his wide eyes, he said sweetly, ""Maddie, I want fish casserole. Will you make it for me?""

Madeline Houghton tapped his nose with a fond smile. ""Of course.""

Jacob's eyes lit up, clearly thrilled. He remarked, ""Maddie, you're the best. Not like my mom‚Äîshe never lets me eat too much."" As he spoke, he even pouted a little.

Madeline smiled and gently coaxed him, ""Then you've got to eat a little extra today, Jake.""

Jacob nodded with a warm chuckle. ""Maddie, I wish you were my real mom.""

Madeline's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Jessica felt a dull ache in her chest. She always thought kids tended to overeat when they liked something. She only watched Jacob's diet because she didn't want him to get sick. That was all.

Jessica didn't feel like watching any longer. That was her husband and her son, but somehow, the three of them looked more like a real family. She was the one who seemed out of place.

She turned around and went back into the room.

Not long after, footsteps came from outside. Madeline walked in. Her makeup was flawless, her smile gentle. ""Jessi, come downstairs with me. Let's celebrate Jake's birthday together.""

Madeline used to be Jessica's intern. She came from a poor background and was barely competent.

Jessica had once listened to Madeline cry about her past, saying that if she still couldn't find a job, she would have no choice but to go back to her hometown and get married.

Jessica had felt sorry for her and brought her into the company. She never imagined she'd end up bringing in the very woman who would destroy her family.

Madeline had studied her, mimicked her, and tried to take her place‚Äîto become the new Mrs. Atkinson. By the time Jessica realized it, Madeline had already made her way into the household, getting along perfectly with her husband and son.

Jessica had long seen through the mask Madeline wore and had hated herself for bringing trouble into her own home. Jessica said coldly, ""I'm not feeling well. I'm not going.""

Madeline spoke with feigned innocence, ""Jessi, you're Jake's mom. It would mean a lot to him if you said happy birthday to him.""

Jessica frowned, about to turn her down again. But then something crossed her mind, and she let out a sigh.

She figured this was between her and Madeline. Jacob was still just a child who shouldn't be affected by it. As his mother, Jessica felt it was only right to wish him a happy birthday.

With that thought, she set down her paintbrush and walked downstairs, brushing past Madeline's shoulder, completely ignoring her.

For a split second, Madeline's smile froze. A flicker of malice passed through her eyes, but she quickly followed after.

When Jessica saw Brian and Jacob, she paused.

Ten years ago, she'd joined the Atkinson Group to challenge herself and met Brian there. They'd fought, teased, and fallen into marriage. She had rejected her family's carefully laid plans and insisted on marrying Brian, even cutting ties with them to do it.

For the past ten years, she'd never once regretted her decision. Her husband was rich, handsome, and he treated her well. Their son was smart and adorable. She had once truly believed she had a happy life.

But then, Jessica looked at Madeline, who was smiling attentively as she served food to Brian and Jacob. Madeline's presence had changed everything that once felt so perfect.

Jessica silently picked up her fork to eat, but then a wave of nausea hit her. She quickly put the fork down and rushed to the bathroom, gagging over the sink.

Brian stood up, looking concerned, about to follow her, but Madeline stopped him in a flurry of panic.

She clutched his sleeve, her eyes wide with worry. ""Mr. Atkinson, what's going on with Jessi?""

Brian spoke gently, trying to reassure her, ""She's been like this lately. It's nothing. Don't worry.""

After saying that, he turned to look at Jessica and sneered coldly, ""What's the excuse this time? A cold? Or is the food at home not good enough?""

Jessica didn't respond. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue and thought, 'If I said I was pregnant, would they even believe me?

'Forget it. I'm leaving soon anyway. Why bother telling them? No need to ruin the sweet little bond between my husband and his mistress.'

Even as a secretary, Madeline still dared to chide her boss, speaking in a syrupy tone, ""Mr. Atkinson, don't say that about Jessi. Maybe she really isn't feeling well. She's lost a lot of weight lately.""

Then she stood up, made a cup of hot chamomile tea, and handed it to Jessica. ""Jessi, are you okay? Here, have some chamomile tea.""

Still nauseous and not wanting to see Madeline's face, Jessica grew irritated and pushed her away.

She hadn't even used much force, but Madeline let herself fall with the motion, and the hot chamomile tea spilled onto her own hand.

""Ow!"" Madeline cried out.

""Maddie,"" Brian and Jacob called out at the same time. They instantly rushed to her side, their eyes full of concern as they looked at her hand which was scalded red.

Jacob's eyes welled with tears, feeling sorry for her. ""Maddie, does it hurt a lot?""

Madeline forced a smile and tried to look strong. ""It's okay, Jake. I was just being careless. It doesn't hurt.""

Brian glared at Jessica, his eyes blazing. His voice was like ice. ""What are you trying to pull now?""

Jessica was overwhelmed with sadness and disappointment. She caught the smug look in Madeline's eyes, then saw her own son standing in front of Madeline like a little protector. Jessica shut her eyes in despair and said, ""I didn't do anything.""

But Brian didn't believe her. When the family doctor arrived, Brian helped Madeline sit down, letting her lean against his chest. There was disappointment in his deep-set eyes as well.

He said accusingly, ""Jessi, you've changed. You were never the kind of person to do something like this out of jealousy.""

Jessica thought, 'I've changed? Yeah, I have.'

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had stretch marks from childbirth. Her skin wouldn't have gone dull from staying up all night.

And she definitely wouldn't have quit her job and become a housewife just because of Brian's words‚Äîonly to be replaced by another woman.

Jessica suddenly felt exhausted. She held back the explanation she almost gave and turned to head upstairs.

Right before entering her room, she looked back down at the chaotic scene below and gave one last glance at the husband and son she had once loved with everything she had.

Brian and Jacob were still the same, hovering around Madeline, the three of them tangled up like they couldn't bear to be apart.

Jessica gave a bitter smile and shook her head. Then she gently touched her belly and set a countdown on her phone. Without a trace of hesitation, she turned and went back into the room.

From this moment on, she wouldn't disturb them again.

# Chapter 2 She Was Done Playing Along

The noise outside gradually faded. Jessica didn't bother to check what was going on out there. With her earplugs and sleep mask on, she slept straight through to morning.

Since she'd already decided to return and claim her inheritance, she had to resign from Atkinson Group.

After giving birth to Jacob, she had rarely shown up at the company. But back when Brian had taken over the family business, she had been right there beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.

Atkinson Group's rise to the number-one spot in the country had a lot to do with her. So even though she didn't come in regularly, she still received a generous annual bonus and profit share.

Early in the morning, Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. Her thick, wavy hair framed a flawless face. She was stunning, but her eyes carried no light.

She had always been beautiful. Even after becoming a stay-at-home mom, even after all the sleepless nights and labor, her looks had barely changed.

But the morning sickness, the emotional strain, and the cold treatment from her family had taken their toll. Her eyes were dull, lifeless‚Äîlike fish washed up on the shore.

On the top floor of Atkinson Group, Jessica was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Just then, a few employees behind her started chatting, their voices drifting into earshot.

One said, ""Did you see Madeline's Instagram post?""

Another asked, ""No, what did she post this time?""

Someone else added, ""She posted a bunch of stuff. Looks like she was throwing someone a birthday party. You should check it out.""

They were laughing as they teased each other, but when they looked up and saw Jessica, their smiles froze.

One of them gasped, ""Ms. Grant?""

Another asked, ""Ms. Grant, what brings you here to the office?""

Jessica gave a casual nod. As soon as the employees finished greeting her, they dashed away in a hurry. More whispers followed as they left.

Someone sneered, ""What a buzzkill. What's the executive secretary Jessica doing back here at the company?""

Another said sarcastically, ""She's already the CEO's wife. What's the point of showing off in front of us?""

Someone else snorted, ""I don't think Mr. Atkinson's that close to her anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they're getting a divorce.""

Jessica didn't react. She had never been popular in the company and had long gotten used to this kind of talk.

If she hadn't gone through so much workplace bullying in the past‚Äîif Brian hadn't stepped in and helped her so many times‚Äîshe wouldn't have fallen for him to begin with.

Bored from waiting, Jessica opened Instagram on her phone. The first thing that popped up was a nine-photo post from Madeline.

The first image was taken at Jacob's birthday party last night. The decorations were extravagant, and the giant three-tier cake in the center was impossible to miss.

What caught Jessica's eye was a photo taken in a hospital. Three hands, all different sizes, stacked on top of each other‚Äîit looked so warm and loving.

Jessica thought, 'It was just a burn. Why'd they go to the hospital again?'

She found it ridiculous and scrolled through the comments. Most of them were full of envy and well-wishes.

One comment read: \[Wow, a birthday party for the little one? Looks so happy.\]

Another joked: \[Showing off again‚Äîso who's your husband anyway? Not gonna show your bestie?\]

Someone else wrote: \[No matter what happens, as long as the family's together, that's what really matters.\]

Jessica was speechless. She knew Madeline had posted those on purpose, just to get under her skin and push her into snapping at Brian.

If it had been before, Jessica really wouldn't have been able to stand this pretentious act, watching her own husband and son leave her at home to care for a woman who had done nothing but poorly imitate her from the start.

But now that she was about to leave, she naturally didn't care anymore.

Jessica gave a dry smile and tapped the screen lightly to give the post a like.

After getting her resignation papers, Jessica went straight to the CEO's office and handed them to Brian's current personal assistant.

The people in the Secretary's Office, just like the ones who had been whispering earlier, looked down on her for showing up as if she were trying to brag. But the moment they saw the resignation papers, they gasped in shock.

Someone asked, ""I-I didn't read that wrong, did I?""

""Ms. Grant is quitting?"" another exclaimed.

The assistant froze, visibly panicked. ""M-Ma'am, Mr. Atkinson is in a very important meeting right now. Maybe we should wait and let him have a look at these until he's done.""

""No need. I'm just a figurehead executive secretary. You have the authority to process this. No need to bother him,"" Jessica said with a light smile.

People around them sighed under their breath.

""Is the rumor true? Jessica and Mr. Atkinson are getting a divorce? And the other woman is Madeline?""

""Why Madeline? Doesn't she have a family?""

""Are you dumb? Did you even see that Instagram post? That hand is clearly Mr. Atkinson's. Who else in Hartdale could wear a Rolex that expensive?""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice Madeline took over all of Jessica's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""Now that Jessica's quitting, maybe she's handing the position over.""

Jessica knew exactly how nosy these people were. In the past, hearing things like this would've crushed her. She would've curled up in bed at night, crying quietly under the covers.

But now, she suddenly realized that once she let it go, none of it really mattered.

She smiled at everyone like she couldn't hear a word and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work these past ten years. I hope Atkinson Group continues to thrive for many more to come.""

Everyone fell silent in embarrassment. Only then did Jessica return to her desk and begin packing up everything she'd accumulated over the years.

She had worked here for ten years, and her workspace was filled to the brim with books she'd bought when she first started out and notes she'd taken while learning to understand Brian as his secretary.

On one page, it clearly said: ""1. He needs a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning. 2. He hates being late. 3. He doesn't allow any woman to wear perfume around him.""

There were many notes like that. Every single one of them had been built with Jessica's effort.

She had poured so much into doing her job as a secretary well, but people always assumed the role was just a man's plaything‚Äîthat all it took was a body, not a brain.

Only Brian had seen her working late into the night‚Äîreviewing contracts, building presentations, digging into the background on every competitor of Atkinson Group, and reciting business reports like they were second nature.

It was because she worked hard enough that someone as untouchable as Brian had come down from his pedestal to get close to her.

Jessica had once believed Brian was the one person who truly understood her. She was wrong. After ten years, all those memories and feelings had turned to dust.

She focused on packing her things. Just then, the meeting ended, and Madeline walked out first.

She had been beaming, but the moment she saw Jessica, her smile froze. Madeline thought, 'Why is Jessica here? Did she see my Instagram post? Is she here to lose it on me?

Just thinking about it made her excited. She went back to her desk, restless, waiting for the storm to hit. On the outside, though, she kept her head down, her eyes turning red, like she'd just been horribly wronged.

Brian was the last to walk out. As he passed the Secretary's Office, he saw Jessica there at the office.

Her desk was the closest to his office, a setup that once symbolized her status and their past affection.

But now, just the sight of her annoyed him especially when she looked like she was in a good mood, flipping through a book with a faint smile on her face.

Right next to her, Madeline sat with her head down, looking dejected, quietly dabbing at her tears with a tissue.

Brian frowned, tapped the corner of Jessica's desk, and ordered, ""Come in.""

Jessica looked up, calm and composed. ""Okay.""

Once she stepped inside, Brian got straight to the point. ""The company doesn't need you right now. If there's no special reason, don't come to Atkinson Group again.""

# Chapter 3 Mrs. Atkinson

Jessica froze. No matter how many times she'd been disappointed by Brian, every time she heard his cold tone, it still felt like a knife stabbing straight into her chest.

Her eyes lowered, and the smile on her face disappeared. ""Okay.""

Brian had expected Jessica to lash out, but he hadn't thought she'd give in so easily. Only then did he actually look at her.

He noticed Madeline was right‚ÄîJessica really had lost a lot of weight lately.

He thought, 'Maybe Jessica really was throwing up last night because she wasn't feeling well. Maybe she wasn't being jealous in front of Madeline after all.'

His lips pressed together, and his tone softened slightly. ""Madeline's been doing your job well. Your focus now should be taking care of Jake. I've explained this to you so many times‚Äîthere's nothing between me and her.

""Jessi, stop making trouble. Don't make me regret choosing you to be my wife.""

Jessica thought, 'Regret? I regret it too. I really regret giving up my family's business just to become this so-called Mrs. Atkinson. The Grant family has real status. Grant Group is powerful. I could've gone back and been the heiress everyone doted on instead.'

Jessica closed her eyes and calmly pulled out her resignation letter. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Atkinson, then please go ahead and approve this. I'll officially resign starting tomorrow.""

With that, she turned to leave. But just as she reached the door, Brian grabbed her arm.

""Jessica?"" Brian sounded surprised, as if he hadn't fully processed what was happening. Holding the resignation in one hand, he instinctively reached out and caught her.

He stared at her signature on the resignation letter. His face darkened as he held back a surge of anger. ""You're doing this to spite me? I thought you came today to make peace, but now you're taking it even further?""

""No, Mr. Atkinson. You said Atkinson Group didn't need me, and it just so happens‚ÄîI feel the same."" Jessica kept her gaze lowered, her thick lashes trembling slightly. ""It's been ten years. Atkinson Group isn't what it used to be.

""Since everyone clearly loves Madeline, I figured I might as well step down now instead of holding a position and collecting a paycheck for doing nothing.""

Brian let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp, like he could see straight through her excuse. ""Don't use the past ten years to guilt me. I know Atkinson Group wouldn't be what it is today without you. You were a great employee.

""But Jessica, ever since you had the baby, you haven't been involved in any business matters. I've been nothing but considerate. All you have to do is take care of our son, and you'll always be the lady of Atkinson Group.

""You can't even handle something this simple, and now you say you're stepping aside? All you're doing is putting Madeline in a difficult position. Jessica, I know you too well. You're calculating, but don't be cruel. Since last night, have you even apologized to Maddie?""

Jessica thought, 'Apologize? I'm supposed to apologize to the woman who wrecked my home? Shouldn't she be the one thanking me?'

Suddenly, Jessica let out a laugh and looked at Brian with a hint of curiosity. ""Yes, I'm cruel. Mr. Atkinson, have you never considered giving up?""

The kind of giving up she meant was divorce.

Over the past few years, whenever Brian and Jessica fought, she brought up divorce again and again, and every time it ended in an ugly stalemate.

Brian had never agreed. In his eyes, even if he cheated, Jessica was still his wife.

That was always how it was with Brian‚Äîdomineering and controlling, a man who held power over all of Hartdale.

As for Jessica, at the beginning, she hadn't really meant to leave. She had been acting out, like Brian said, hoping he'd actually care more about her.

But now, she was tired. She was fine with getting a divorce and going their separate ways. She even thought about the kids. They could each take one, and that would be that.

Brian's face darkened, his grip on her arm tightening like he could snap her in half. ""This is your last chance, Jessica. If you mess up again, I won't hesitate to find Jake a new mom.

""Do you know how many times he's complained to me he has no joy or freedom living with you? Why are you such a failure as both a wife and a mother?""

The word ""failure"" made her close her eyes and let out a long breath.

Jessica thought, 'So that's how it is. Waiting up all night for Brian to come home and making him hangover cures was a failure. Hand-washing his designer suits in the dead of winter until my hands were raw was a failure.

'Tutoring Jake through elementary math, raising a child who fit the Atkinson family's image of an heir was a failure. This home really has no place for me anymore.'

""I'm sorry, Mr. Atkinson,"" Jessica said sincerely. She believed someone who failed should take a final bow and leave the stage.

Her other hand slipped into her coat pocket and tapped her phone screen. The countdown began‚Äîthere were fourteen days left.

Once everything was in order, she would disappear completely. Brian would never have to be annoyed by her again.

Jessica's attitude caught Brian off guard. He still wanted to say something, but she didn't give him the chance and turned to leave.

She walked away without hesitation. Brian reached out again, but caught nothing.

Suddenly, a sharp pain clenched in his chest, a wave of panic rising fast and hard.

He frowned, watching her disappear down the hall, a strange sense growing stronger‚Äîthat something important was slipping further and further away from him.

Once outside, Jessica called her best friend, Gabriela Clark. They were besties, though they hadn't spoken in over six years.

Gabriela was a fashion designer, constantly flying around the country, tailoring clothes for different models. A lot of them were male, and with adults working in close quarters, it wasn't unusual for things to happen.

Put plainly, Gabriela went through boyfriends like outfits. Brian had always hated that about her. After Jessica had their child, he'd told her to stay away from Gabriela, said she'd be a bad influence on Jacob.

So Jessica had listened and cut ties with the friend she grew up with for six whole years.

After not hearing from Jessica for years, Gabriela was furious. She picked up and snapped, ""So you finally remembered I exist? Jessica, I thought you were way too far gone in your lovesick haze. And now you finally call‚Äîwhat, regretting it already?""

Jessica let out a helpless laugh, tears falling before she even noticed.

She hadn't cried when Brian humiliated her, hadn't cried when Madeline made a fool of her, not even when the child she carried for nine months called someone else Mom. But with Gabriela, Jessica sobbed in regret.

""Yes, I regret it,"" Jessica said. ""Gabi, if I come back now, is it too late?""

On the other end of the line, Gabriela went quiet for a long time after hearing Jessica's sincere words. When she finally spoke again, her voice was choked with tears.

She said, ""I'm just glad you've come to your senses. You idiot, do you have any idea how exhausting it's been running the studio for you all these years? The entire art world's been waiting for your return.

""Jessica, being a CEO's secretary only buried your talent. You were born to be an artist‚Äîyou're the last true gem of the Impressionist world. Jessi, I've been waiting for you this whole time.""

""I'm sorry, Gabi. I'm so sorry."" Jessica crouched down in the middle of the street, crying.

Jessica was always meant to be proud. She had been brilliant and talented from the start. Even Brian didn't know that she had studied fine art at a university in Fiorenelle, a city in Aurevia.

Her very first graduation piece had made it into the Viremont Grand Biennale, shocking the entire art world.

After graduation, the paintings she signed off on had sold at auction for more than a million dollars.

And yet, for the sake of so-called experience, she came back to the country and started over in a job that had nothing to do with her field. She studied admin, finance, and business management from scratch and still excelled at it.

She gave up painting for ten years. But today, she had finally decided‚Äîshe was going back.

# Chapter 4 Her Ungrateful Son

After agreeing on a time with Gabriela to take over the studio, Jessica returned to Atkinson Villa.

She had given herself a 15-day countdown because ten years had left too many things unresolved. She couldn't just walk away. There were still matters to handle.

The most important of all was everything inside Atkinson Villa.

The massive villa, over 5,000 square feet, had no housekeepers simply because Brian thought they were too noisy. The daily cleaning had always fallen to Jessica.

Now that she was leaving, she intended to step down like the perfect secretary she'd always been. It was a matter of pride‚Äîas the heiress of the Grant family.

Madeline clearly wasn't the type to do housework, so Jessica had to find a qualified housekeeper for her husband and child.

During the day, Jessica interviewed several candidates, having each of them cook according to Brian's preferences. In the evening, as she was eating at home, an urgent voice came from the front door. ""Chester, call the family doctor. Now."" It was Brian.

Jessica, being pregnant, was especially sensitive to the smell of blood, and the air immediately made her nauseous.

She frowned, an instinctive worry rising. 'What happened? Is he hurt?' she pondered.

She instinctively started toward the door, only to see Brian hurrying in, carrying a woman in his arms. It was winter in Hartdale, snow falling steadily, soaking his hair and shoulders, but he didn't seem to notice.

He laid the woman down on the couch and barked, furious, ""Where is the family doctor? Hurry up.""

Jessica didn't even need to see the woman's face to know who she was. It was Madeline.

Wrapped in her thick robe, Jessica stood to the side and calmly asked, ""What happened to her?""

They had just argued in the morning. Brian glanced at Jessica but didn't seem interested in talking to her. His voice was filled with annoyance. ""She ran into some loan sharks and took a stab to the shoulder.""

""Loan sharks? Whose debt?"" Jessica asked, curious. She thought, 'What, has the CEO of Atkinson Group gone bankrupt?'

Before Brian could respond, Madeline, pale and weak, spoke up in a pitiful voice, ""I'm sorry, Jessi. It's my fault. My dad owes gambling debts, and somehow those people found out I was Mr. Atkinson's secretary.

""They waited on a dark road tonight and tried to kidnap me. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Atkinson was working late and happened to be there. If he hadn't shown up and saved me, I might've been killed.""

""Don't say things like that,"" Brian said sharply. ""As long as I'm around, no one will lay a finger on you. But your place isn't safe for now. I've already called the police. Until they catch those men, you'll stay at Atkinson Villa.""

""No."" Jessica didn't hesitate at all.

Hearing that, Brian looked up at her.

Jessica seemed in good spirits. Maybe it was because she had quit her job and reconnected with her best friend. Her cheeks were rosy, her skin glowing. She wore a soft silk robe, standing there lazily, full of charm.

Brian had been irritable since morning, but hearing Jessica's flat rejection actually calmed him down.

He turned his head, sneering with what looked like mockery. He thought, 'Just like I thought. Another game of push and pull. She acts like she's indifferent, but deep down she's still jealous of Madeline.'

His tone turned low and warning. ""Jessica, this is Atkinson Villa."" He was the one who owned this place. Whoever got to stay here was up to him.

""She still can't stay,"" Jessica said firmly. ""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

Atkinson Villa was big, spanning three full floors, but there were only three actual bedrooms.

One room was for Jacob, one for Jessica, and one for Brian. That was all there was.

There used to be extra guest rooms in Atkinson Villa, but back when Jessica and Brian were newlyweds and still happy, Brian had had them all remodeled.

There was a luxurious nursery, a walk-in closet, a display room for luxury goods, and spaces Jessica used to pass the time‚Äîlike a flower room, an art studio, and a yoga room. But there were no extra bedrooms.

In fact, the third bedroom was planned by Brian for their second child in the future. But back then, they never imagined that one day they'd be sleeping apart because of emotional distance.

Brian hadn't expected Jessica to reject Madeline's stay for this reason. His face instantly darkened.

His voice was tight, like he was clenching his teeth. ""Jessica, you sleep in the master bedroom.""

The implication was clear‚Äîthey could share a bed. After all, no matter how strained things had gotten, just three months ago, they had still slept together. That was how Jessica ended up pregnant.

But Jessica didn't care. That night had only happened because Brian was drunk three months ago. Back then, her feelings had been a tangled mess of love and resentment. Now, neither was left. There was no reason for them to be intimate anymore.

Jessica stood her ground, stubborn and unmoving, and the sight of it made Brian's anger boil over.

At that moment, Jacob came downstairs, still groggy from sleep. ""Dad, Mom, what's going on? I heard you two arguing again.""

He spoke with a pouty, wronged tone, then glanced over and saw Madeline on the couch, still bleeding as her wound was being treated. He snapped to attention. ""Maddie.""

Jacob ran over quickly. ""Maddie, what happened? Why are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Madeline smiled, patting his head, ""It's nothing, Jake. Be good and go back to bed.""

""I'm not going. You're hurt. I'm not sleeping until you're better."" Jacob was still a clingy child, and he clung to Madeline without letting go.

Seeing how much he liked Madeline, Jessica suddenly curved her lips into a smile. ""Jake, don't worry. Maddie might be staying with us for the next few days.

""But since we don't have enough bedrooms, would it be okay if Maddie sleeps in your room with you?""

""Really?"" Jacob's eyes widened, full of excitement and joy. ""Yeah, that'd be‚Äî""

Halfway through, he quickly clamped his hand over his mouth. ""No, I didn't mean it like that, Mom.""

Jacob thought, 'I totally forgot. Mom hates it when I act like I love Maddie. The last time I stayed out playing with Maddie too long and forgot to come home, Mom got super mad.

'After that, Dad told me I shouldn't let Mom see how much I love Maddie.'

""It's okay. You can mean it,"" Jessica said quietly, her voice soft as her cold hands beneath the robe rested gently over her belly.

Today, she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ungrateful child.

Jessica still remembered the day Jacob was born. She'd gone through a long labor for nearly two days. The doctors had said she might not survive and told Brian he had to choose whether to save the mother or the baby.

Brian's eyes had been bloodshot, screaming outside the OR that he only wanted Jessica.

But Jessica had refused. In tears, she'd begged the doctors to save the baby. She'd said she could give up everything, anything‚Äîjust not the child she shared with Brian.

In the end, she'd pulled through on sheer will, giving birth to Jacob naturally without a single dose of anesthesia.

Jessica gave up her career to raise Jacob herself, day in and day out. And now, what she got in return was a child who favored another woman and wanted a different mom.

Jessica was really tired. She hadn't even wanted to keep the baby she was carrying. When she got the results from last week's checkup, her first instinct had been to give it up.

Her life felt too hopeless. She hadn't planned on having another child with Brian.

But when she thought about leaving, Jessica started to feel a glimmer of hope. She thought that maybe this time, without the Atkinson family holding her back, she and her child could grow freely and things might be better.

With that thought, Jessica stopped looking back and walked away.

Jacob didn't understand why his mom was acting this way. He stood frozen, watching her leave, silent for a long time, and then suddenly burst into tears.

He was a sensitive kid. Even if he didn't understand anything, something deep in his blood told him he was being left behind.

His sudden crying startled Madeline. She quickly hugged him and tried to comfort him, ""Jake, don't cry. I'm right here. Don't be scared.""

She looked at Brian, nervous, her eyes brimming with tears like she was silently accusing Jessica of making Jacob cry again.

Brian's face was grim. He looked up toward the second floor, his eyes brooding. But in the end, he didn't say a word.

# Chapter 5 She'd Had Enough

Jessica slept through the night without dreams. The next morning, when she came downstairs planning to make herself breakfast, she smelled food the moment she reached the stairs.

It was Madeline. She had already made breakfast for the whole family and was now grinding coffee for Brian by hand.

When she saw Jessica, she smiled and greeted her, ""Jessi, you're up. Come on, I made sandwiches. I'm not sure if you'll like them.""

""Maddie's cooking is great. Who wouldn't like it?"" Jacob chimed in with a bright smile, then sneaked a glance at Jessica. There was a flicker of fear in his expression. He was afraid of his mother, and he resented her too.

He felt like Jessica had suddenly become a different person. He didn't understand why she had looked at him with such a cold expression before.

Every time Jacob praised Maddie in the past, it would set Jessica off, making her try harder to be good to him‚Äîjust so he could use that as a chance to slack off from all his tutoring sessions.

Jessica could more or less guess what her son was thinking. She let out a faint, mocking smile and thought, 'Does he really think I, his mother, can't see through a kid's little tricks?'",1,1753603772.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of Russian keyboard stickers can vary significantly, impacting usability and longevity. The best stickers are designed to withstand daily use and provide a clear, readable font that enhances the typing experience.

**Material Quality:** The materials used to manufacture the stickers directly influence their durability and resistance to wear and tear. Stickers made from high-quality vinyl or PVC are generally more durable and resistant to scratches, fading, and peeling compared to those made from cheaper materials.

High-quality materials also ensure that the stickers adhere securely to the keys without leaving any sticky residue behind when removed. Thickness is another crucial factor; thicker stickers provide more protection for the underlying key but can sometimes affect key feel,so a balanced approach is ideal. Look for stickers that offer a good compromise between durability and a comfortable typing experience.

**Adhesive strength:** The adhesive used on the back of the stickers plays a vital role in their long-term performance. A strong, reliable adhesive ensures that the stickers stay firmly in place, even with frequent and heavy use.Stickers with subpar adhesive may start to peel off after only a few weeks or months, requiring frequent replacements.The best stickers use an adhesive that is strong enough to maintain a secure bond but also allows for clean removal without damaging the underlying keys or leaving behind sticky residue. Consider stickers specifically designed for easy submission and removal, as these often feature higher-quality adhesives.

**Font Clarity and Design:** The clarity and design of the Russian characters printed on the stickers significantly impact their usability. Clear, well-defined characters make it easier to type accurately and efficiently, reducing the risk of errors.

The font should be easily readable, even in low light conditions, and the characters should be appropriately sized to fit comfortably on the keys without obscuring any existing labels. Some stickers also feature a matte finish to minimize glare and improve visibility. Look for stickers with a contrasting color scheme (e.g., white characters on a black background) to further enhance readability.

It's crucial to choose stickers that are compatible with your specific keyboard model to ensure a proper fit and prevent any interference with neighboring keys.standard keyboard stickers are generally suitable for most laptops and desktop keyboards, but some specialized keyboards (e.g., ergonomic keyboards or those with non-standard key sizes) may require custom-sized stickers. Before purchasing, carefully measure the size of your keys and compare them to the dimensions provided by the sticker manufacturer.Also, check whether the sticker layout corresponds to the desired Russian phonetic layout (e.g., JCUKEN or phonetic).

**Protective Coating:** Some high-end Russian keyboard stickers come with a protective coating that further enhances their durability and resistance to wear and tear. This coating acts as a barrier against scratches, fading, and exposure to moisture, prolonging the lifespan of the stickers and maintaining their appearance over time.Protective coatings can also make the stickers easier to clean, as they prevent dirt and grime from accumulating on the surface. When evaluating Russian keyboard stickers,consider models that offer a protective coating for added durability and longevity.

hi! i am a recently rehired partner (early 20‚Äôs queer person) who was hired as a ssv in march and have been in a messy situation with housing recently due to multiple factors, but decided that where i was ending up was close enough to just transfer my position in some form. it was kind of an emergency, so i was being kicked out in june of where i was staying and needed to be gone by july basically, so, after talking with my (now former) SM and DM we all decided it would probably be in my best interest to take a demotion to barista in the transfer to my new district. i tried to be reasonable in the transfer as much as i could, and sacrificed my own time during moving so that i could work out my last 3 weeks after finding out i needed to leave. i was told by both my old and current sm that they needed 2 SSVs soon so that this would be a ‚Äútrial period‚Äù. i literally hit my 90 days on my first day in the new store i think‚Ä¶ 

anyways, i agree to take said demotion and transfer to this new store, where they have an acting sm in charge. my (current) sm, is on leave, for i forget why but will be back in the first week or so of august. my acting sm has literally told baristas that they don‚Äôt care about the position really. which, to be fair, is a valid thing to say right now, it‚Äôs just, you ARE THE STORE MANAGER RN. i was very honest of my intentions in that i really just want to serve coffee in peace, regardless of my position, just like id like to not take a demotion? but if i am, I NEED TO BE TOLD. because acting sm transferred me into the new store as a supervisor, so it‚Äôs been a whole conversation on the floor regarding my own credentials as everyone sees me in playcaller/builder as a supervisor still, and my partner file has me hired in as a supervisor at my new store. i don‚Äôt have keys or safe/alarm code but baristas also somewhat expect me to still use my numbers that still work as a ssv. which is so annoying that they are expecting me to be a supervisor rn kinda because nobody else is doing it??? if that makes sense. we‚Äôre shuffling around the store‚Äôs roster right now still, which has just been so confusing also. so many people with different levels of management in the store rn. we‚Äôre all very lost, and i just want to find clarity, for everyone. if they don‚Äôt want me to be a supervisor, then demote me. because i‚Äôm not gonna be led on constantly either. 

but i‚Äôve came into this store, which is about 800 transactions a day max (my last store was about 600 max per day), and i really have been trying to bring a better attitude while still learning my role more and more as i hadn‚Äôt had that moment to do so really in my last store, on paper. i have shift manager experience at dunkin, i am studying public health in college, and could potentially be the literal health inspector for the store. i AM young, and i want to have a fun time as much as possible, and i am clear about it! just i have very much ‚Äúearned my place‚Äù in multiple coffee establishments now (this is my third sbux store/the third district i‚Äôve worked in, ive worked between 2 dunkin‚Äôs also, and have had other qsr shift management experience) and wont allow people to discredit my experiences, as that IS AGEISM??? just also we all gotta put our stuff at the door, and focus on our jobs right now especially as the company is implementing changes. because i do take my work seriously. because as a trans person, this job does relatively make me feel okayer. and i like that about this company. it‚Äôs not perfect. i never said it was, never will say it is either, as i am honest. 

i dont really know what to do at this point as a ssv from another store in our district is transferring to our store now, and i just don‚Äôt knowww. she‚Äôs an ACTUAL external hire, which she tried calling me an external hire first, on the first day she came in my new store. which i don‚Äôt rock with as i am a REHIRE, i was just hired in 2020 and it was my first job, and i hadn‚Äôt worked here in like 4 years. so i am familiar still with everything/the lingo, just finding my way around still also AS THERES SO MUCH NEW EQUIPMENT. AND SO IS SHE! (in more of a sense, inexperienced somehow also) but for her to demean me and my experience is insane, when she can‚Äôt solo bar/drive when needed, can‚Äôt handle mobile bar at peak without making mistakes/getting backed up, etc is just insane for her to act like she‚Äôs better, when she is making the same mistakes i do (OR ALREADY HAVE DONE AND LEARNED FROM!!) still :/. she said she was hired in right before holiday last year. okkkk rant over, please ask for more clarification if needed.

-when sm comes back in august, what should my first conversation be like? how should i prepare? i‚Äôve been just scheduled coverage for this past month in this new store, so they are seeing me kinda be barista? they have put me on for a 2 keyholder (3 person total, me and other established ssv (THAT I LIKE!!!) have the same shift) closing shift for the newest schedule, so i am now kinda freaking out because why are we changing? what DOES this mean? 

-how do i handle myself in the meantime? i don‚Äôt know what to do, whether to take the charge and make the decision ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù when it‚Äôs needed? because it‚Äôs being implied that it‚Äôs needed to me by my fellow ssvs and baristas at times. do i show that i can handle this? i have started to really try to take charge and ask for accountability in cleaning our store recently as acting sm has ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù to schedule clean play for the past like month! i am a firm believer that in our role anyone needs to be speaking up about health issues when they can (obviously internally first), and i really am trying to adapt to the new environment also at the same time with relatively similar labor. the store isn‚Äôt FILTHY, but partners have all had a general consensus that it has gotten dirtier while SM was away. but we need to start to clean guys? ü§®

-DO I start applying to other stores? it‚Äôs heavily implied kinda that nobody is really concrete in our district for management, so I AM WILLING to transfer AGAIN, but like‚Ä¶ we need to have the conversation!!! do we think testing the waters and picking up coverage at other stores in my new district is a good idea? 

-am i just gonna lose my job‚Ä¶ i was 2 hours late the other day as i honestly overslept for a morning shift (which i was open that i had not done before in my last store) and everyone said it was fine and nobody coached me or anything‚Ä¶ but i fear when our sm comes back she‚Äôs just gonna clean house again or something by writing a ton of people up?!! no accountability has been happening in the store for ANYONE so it HAS been so hard to exactly know when to be ‚Äúup to standard‚Äù and when is ‚Äúbad‚Äù like making your markouts, ringing on not your own tills, etc. and it‚Äôs been very gray and i don‚Äôt like that with how corporate is right now either‚Ä¶ 

i‚Äôm just so over being avoided right now because i need to have conversations about my position at some point but i don‚Äôt really want to go to ethics either. i‚Äôm very okay with being up to standard in every way, it‚Äôs just we have to hold people accountable that don‚Äôt also‚Ä¶ am i crazy????",1,1753603174.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

The apartment complex wasn‚Äôt exactly luxury living, but it had running water, thick walls, and a semi-reliable mail system. That was more than some places, and for Jordan and Tasha, it was enough. They didn‚Äôt ask for much. Just peace, a working heater in winter, and rent that didn‚Äôt leave their account gasping for air every first of the month.

They were survivors. Piecers. Patchers. Nothing in their small, two-bedroom unit was new. Not the mismatched bar stools at the counter. Not the sagging love seat they‚Äôd reupholstered with a clearance bin drop cloth. And certainly not the nightstands made from milk crates stacked and zip-tied like furniture on parole.

Tasha had a good eye for things most people overlooked. Jordan had the muscle to drag it all up three flights of stairs. It was a system. If it looked clean, passed the flashlight-and-glove test, and didn‚Äôt crawl or stink, it came home with them.

On a muggy Thursday evening in July, just before the sun ducked behind the trees and the bugs started humming like powerlines, Tasha spotted it. A coffee table. Not just any table. This one looked like something out of a designer catalog. Sleek lines, heavy tempered glass top, brushed gold legs. It didn‚Äôt belong out here, not leaning against the dumpster behind Building C like an orphaned promise.

‚ÄúYo,‚Äù she called over her shoulder, eyes locked on the prize. ‚ÄúBabe. Come look at this.‚Äù

Jordan came clomping down in his busted sneakers, half a sandwich in hand, wiping mustard off his lip. One look and he was nodding. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs real. That‚Äôs a three-hundred-dollar piece, easy.‚Äù

‚ÄúTry a thousand,‚Äù Tasha muttered, running her fingers along the beveled edge. ‚ÄúI seen one just like it on that HGTV show. This one‚Äôs heavy. Look at the legs. Real metal. Not that fake particle board junk.‚Äù

Jordan knelt and gave it a good lift from one side. His back popped. ‚ÄúYeah. This ain‚Äôt no Walmart special.‚Äù

They gave it a once-over. No bugs. No mold. A little dusty maybe, but otherwise clean. Still, there was something off. A faint chemical smell, like bleach and pennies. Jordan wrinkled his nose but brushed it off.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll hose it down, spray it with Lysol, let it dry on the deck. Be good as new.‚Äù

Tasha nodded. ‚ÄúThis thing‚Äôs gonna class up the whole place.‚Äù

The hard part was getting it upstairs.

The stairs groaned and clanked under its weight. Jordan was behind it, pushing, while Tasha grunted from the top, pulling like a woman possessed. They made it to the second floor landing, sweating and swearing, when a woman from the next building over stepped out of the breezeway.

She looked frazzled. Mid-forties, maybe older, with a cigarette clinging to her bottom lip and a set of keys dangling from her wrist. She paused at the top of the stairs, watching them with tired eyes.

‚ÄúY‚Äôall ain‚Äôt seen a young man come through here, have you?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúTall, light-skinned, maybe with a blue backpack?‚Äù

Jordan shook his head. ‚ÄúNah. Not since earlier today, maybe. Why, he missing?‚Äù

The woman gave a tight, distracted smile. ‚ÄúJust haven‚Äôt seen him since last night. He stays over in 3C. That‚Äôs my sister‚Äôs boy.‚Äù

Tasha offered a polite nod. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll keep an eye out.‚Äù

But the woman didn‚Äôt walk off right away. Her gaze lingered on the table.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a nice piece,‚Äù she said slowly, narrowing her eyes. ‚ÄúLooks just like one my nephew had. He was real proud of that thing. Kept it spotless.‚Äù

Tasha glanced at Jordan. ‚ÄúWe just found it by the dumpster.‚Äù

The woman frowned faintly, then forced a half-smile and flicked her cigarette to the ground. ‚ÄúWell, if he shows up, tell him his aunt‚Äôs looking.‚Äù

She disappeared around the corner.

Jordan and Tasha hauled the table the rest of the way, rinsed it off on the balcony, and let it dry in the sun. By the next day, it had pride of place in their living room. Tasha even cleared off their old makeshift one to make space.

It was beautiful.

But then the smell started.

Subtle at first. A sour, metallic tang that clung to the air, especially in the afternoon heat. Jordan thought it was the trash. Tasha blamed the neighbors. But every time they passed the table, it was stronger.

They scrubbed it again. Lysol. Bleach. Even that expensive pet-odor enzyme stuff.

The smell stayed.

Then came the dripping.

Thick, brownish liquid. Seeping slowly from a thin seam underneath. They put a bowl under it. Changed towels. Sprayed Febreze. Nothing helped.

Tasha grew more anxious. Jordan got annoyed. They argued over tossing it, but neither one of them wanted to give up something that nice. Not after all the work it took getting it up there.

Then, on the fourth night, just after midnight, it happened.

They were in bed. The air was thick. Something wet hit the floor.

A heavy crack sounded from the living room.

Followed by a low thump.

Jordan sat up first.

Tasha was already out of bed, staring at the hall like she expected something to come walking out of it.

They moved together, slow, into the glow of the living room lamp.

The table had split open.

Something thick and pale was spilling from underneath.

They didn‚Äôt have to touch it. Didn‚Äôt have to get close.

Because the stench hit them like a slap.

And in the middle of the mess, curled in unnatural angles, was a body.

Wrapped in plastic.

One leg jutting free. A hand exposed. A wrist tattoo just barely visible.

Tasha dropped to her knees.

Because she recognized it.

And it wasn‚Äôt a stranger

1maglx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1maglx9/does_caffeinecoffee_get_boring_each_day/,Does caffeine(coffee) get boring each day?,"Hi to everyone!
New here and got a new reddit account but had been reading the sub anonymously for 2 month already.

Tl;dr: did you notice coffee/tea/even chocolate becomes tasteless, obnoxious, boring over time? So that you try to make it better every day but actually never achieve this ‚Äúperfect cup‚Äù.

Been caffeine-free for more than two month already, if not the small one week tea relapse it is more than 5 month now. And if it is just ‚Äúcoffee-free‚Äù - almost 9 month. Not planning going back.

I had never consumed a lot of it (1 cup of double espresso/1 cup of tea a day) but could feel its ill-effects. This stuff often made me feel like trash, like not my true self.

To note, before 2019-2021 short-lived coffee addiction I wasn‚Äôt a coffee person at all. When I tried instant coffee at 16 y.o. and felt TREMENDOUS heartburn (as well as coffee itself was disgusting af, bitter and smelled like used engine oil lol) I thought ‚Äúis that coffee??? Is that what‚Äôs all the hype about? Nah I want some coca cola now.

After trying again in 2019 I tried real espresso and‚Ä¶ like that? It wasn‚Äôt anywhere like any instant trash. It was normal. I could drink it for four days max until I felt the symptoms, and had to do small breaks to be able to drink it at all, before completely giving up in 2 years.

The fun fact I noticed was that coffee became boring each day. Not stale, just boring and tasted more disgusting over time, as if my taste buds were in ‚Äúmachine learning mode‚Äù and were signaling like ‚Äúbro this is trash‚Äù. Each day I needed something to cover it up - milk, a latte instead, sugar, syrup. Every time I was in McDonalds I ordered coffee with DOUBLE CARAMEL topping and some chocolate too. Just to be able to drink it. And I know most people don‚Äôt even drink espresso or black coffee because they find it ‚Äútoo harsh‚Äù or bitter.

I thought at first ‚Äútea must be different‚Äù when I switched. Well, so I thought! Tea tasted good only for the first time, then it was like ‚Äúsupermeh‚Äù, basically tainted milk water, and without milk I noticed I didn‚Äôt really taste anything in it‚Ä¶ the so-called tannins, the smell, non-existent. And believe me I wasted a lot of money on it so this wasn‚Äôt some cheapskate teabag stuff (but I also drank teabags, they often tasted BETTER than loose leaf!), as well as got only the top quality Italian coffee that was freshly roasted.

As for chocolate - SAME! One time I taste it, it is awesome, but the next day it tastes ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. Same thing again.

At some point my addiction was so ridiculous to the point of me buying some coffee, tasting it, finding it bad, then buying new pack again and finding it bad as well, until settling with some dark roasted Lavazza charcoals that actually tasted good enough. Espresso fans call it ‚Äúdialing-in‚Äùü§£ There are many videos on YouTube where people taste perfectly-looking espresso and say ‚Äúhmm I guess it is underextracted‚Äù or ‚Äúkinda overextracted to me‚Äù. And r/espresso is full of similar complaints from people who use 2000$+ machines: that‚Äôs a far cry from me brewing with 200$ something Delonghi.

And I thought? Maybe those were not underextraction, overextraction but that we just ‚Äúget used‚Äù and bored by the taste of coffee? But we drink it because of addiction.

If you tell someone to eat pasta for breakfast everyday, same pasta with same ingredients, would it still be tasty at the day 5? I guess person would hate those noodles for the rest of the lifeü§£ (sorry dear Italians, I dunno how some of you consume it everyday, according to cultural mythsüòÉ).

What are your thoughts? Have you experienced something similar that your favorite cuppa ‚Äúno longer tastes the same‚Äù?",1,1753602755.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

My mom (59) passed early June this year. There's not a thing that doesn't remind me of her. Out of those things, there's not a thing that is nearly as enjoyable now as it was when we would do it together. 

When we planned for things around the yard and the house, it mostly seemed like a project to look forward to. Now, when I am alone it is a source of burden and stress.

When I would go to the room she was in, I was happy to greet her and hear her greet me. Now, the room is just a painful reminder of life that used to happen in it.

Every time I helped her with the toilet, medications, when I massaged her, helped her get up, washed and combed her hair, etc. it seemed like an opportunity to talk. Now I have nobody to talk to for the most of the day.

Grocery shopping, preparing meals, and eating was something we would plan for and do together. Now I often don't even plan for my meals and just get what I have. 

There are so many other things we did together. As a matter of fact, there were barely any things (except for maybe my work and an occassional coffee with friends) we didn't do together or for each other. 

I don't feel a relief now. I feel that I actually didn't become independent and separated from my mom in my 20s, as most of my friends did. Quite the opposite. I feel like I became closer to her and maybe even dependent on her approval. It feels like an incredibly strong bond has been torn apart and there are wounds and holes inside me. Everything I do now comes with a sense of guilt, if that makes sense. While she was alive, I would never do many of the things I am doing without consulting her. Continuing with life, when I'm not drowning in tears, feels somehow wrong. 

I'm wondering if anyone has experienced the same or a similar thing here?

Just had to say ‚Äî I‚Äôm obsessed with your videos! They‚Äôre honestly like therapy.
I only look forward to cooking these days so I can have your videos playing in the background. Instant good vibes! üß° 

Me (25F) and my husband (28M) recently got married a few months back, but we‚Äôve been together for 3 years and living together for 2 before marriage. We both work 9 to 5 jobs and live in another country with just our pet cat.

Weekends are usually spent hanging out with our close group of friends‚Äîdinners, late-night chats, board games, etc. Nothing wild or party-like, just casual, fun social stuff. My husband loves these hangouts. And while I enjoy them too, I‚Äôve started to feel like he prefers being around them more than being with just me.

It‚Äôs not like he doesn‚Äôt want me around‚Äîhe‚Äôd rather I be there with the group than doing anything alone with just me. And that stings a little. My biggest love language is quality time, and I‚Äôve told him that. I just want some simple, one-on-one time. Coffee dates, deep convos, just‚Ä¶ us. But he never really initiates that.

We‚Äôve argued about this before. He says I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like the things he likes,‚Äù and I say I try to do the things he likes (aka all the friend hangouts), but I need him to meet me halfway and do things I enjoy too. Spoiler: doesn‚Äôt really happen.

Anyway, here‚Äôs the main issue.

One evening, we were all planning a game night at a friend‚Äôs house. I was in the car with a couple of friends while my husband and another friend went to our apartment to pick up some board games. The friend called me asking where the games were kept, and I told him it‚Äôs usually my husband who knows.

A few minutes later, I remembered where I had kept them and called back. After hanging up, I thought of checking our pet cam (which we both agreed to install to watch our cat) to see if they were picking the right box.

So I opened the app. They had already found the games, but I noticed they were having a beer and chatting. I was just about to close the app when I heard my husband say something like:

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt even do the things I want anymore because of her.‚Äù

Then something about me ‚Äúrestricting‚Äù him and making him come home early (note: I‚Äôve only ever asked him to not stay out all night, because then he sleeps in and we lose half the weekend).

I didn‚Äôt catch everything clearly due to background noise, but it really hit me. He was venting about me to one of our mutual friends. I would never talk about him like that to our friends. If I have an issue, I talk to him, directly and privately.

I get that I probably crossed a line. I wasn‚Äôt planning to spy‚ÄîI genuinely opened it to check the game box. But I stayed longer to listen, and that‚Äôs on me.

But also‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve always been really open with each other. We have access to each other‚Äôs phones, social media, etc. We‚Äôve had serious convos before about how we won‚Äôt air out our dirty laundry to others and will resolve issues just between us.

So hearing him vent to a friend‚Äîespecially our friend‚Äîabout how I ‚Äúrestrict‚Äù him and stop him from doing things he enjoys really hurt.

Now I‚Äôm questioning whether this is just the tip of the iceberg‚Äîif he‚Äôs said other stuff about me to others. And honestly, it made me decide I won‚Äôt stop him from doing anything anymore. If he wants to be out all night, fine. If he wants to spend every weekend with friends, fine. I‚Äôll back off. I‚Äôm tired of pushing for one-on-one time.

Kenji sat staring at his laptop, the screen filled with job application forms. He had stood his ground against the Weaver‚Äôs powerful logic, but that philosophical victory didn‚Äôt pay rent. The reality of his situation, unemployed, with dwindling savings, felt more immense and chaotic than any abstract dragon. The ""noise"" in his head was back, a low, grinding hum of anxiety and self-doubt.

His phone buzzed on the table, startling him. The screen read: `Alex`. He almost let it go to voicemail, feeling too drained for conversation, but a part of him forced his hand to answer.

‚ÄúHey man, how are you holding up?‚Äù Alex‚Äôs voice was warm and familiar.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Kenji managed, his own voice sounding flat even to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ you know. Hanging in there.‚Äù

There was a brief pause on the other end. Alex, who had known Kenji for years, could read the dictionary of his silences. ‚ÄúYou sound like crap,‚Äù he said, not with judgment, but with friendly bluntness. ‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôm not taking no for an answer. I‚Äôm ten minutes from your place. We‚Äôre going for a walk, maybe grab a coffee. No big deal, just getting you out of that apartment for an hour. See you in a bit.‚Äù Before Kenji could protest, the line went dead.

Kenji sighed, a mix of annoyance and quiet relief. As he pushed himself up to find his shoes, the Weaver‚Äôs presence made itself known. Its voice was different now, devoid of its usual argumentative, nihilistic edge. It was dispassionate, clinical, like a researcher stating the parameters of a new study.

*‚ÄúMy logical framework has proven insufficient to parse your conclusions on ‚Äòmeaning‚Äô derived from non-optimal choices. Therefore, I require more data. I will cease adversarial debate and enter a period of passive observation. Proceed with this ‚Äòfriendship‚Äô interaction. I will be monitoring all relevant physiological and psychological responses.‚Äù*

A few minutes later, Kenji was walking alongside Alex under the cool, overcast sky. The conversation was light, meandering. Alex told a ridiculous story about a mishap at his office, not for any reason other than it was funny. He didn't ask about the job hunt. He didn't offer unsolicited advice. He just‚Ä¶ existed alongside Kenji.

They ended up at a small, quiet coffee shop, sitting at a table by the window.

‚ÄúSo, really,‚Äù Alex said, his tone gentle now. ‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù

Kenji looked down at his cup, the steam curling into the air. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough,‚Äù he said honestly. ‚ÄúThe search is a grind. And my head‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ loud lately.‚Äù

Alex nodded slowly, taking a sip of his own coffee. He didn‚Äôt offer a solution. He didn‚Äôt say ‚Äòit will all be okay.‚Äô He just said, ‚ÄúYeah, man. That sounds rough. Seriously, if you need anything, even just to vent or have someone to sit in silence with, I‚Äôm here.‚Äù

And as he spoke, the Weaver was silently collating data. `Observation: The Host is articulating his negative state. The other human is not offering a solution, but an affirmation of presence. Subject Kenji‚Äôs respiration has deepened. Heart rate has stabilized from its elevated state. Muscular tension in the shoulders has demonstrably decreased.`

They finished their coffee, the comfortable silence between them more meaningful than any words. On the walk back, Alex clapped him on the shoulder. ‚ÄúGood to see you, man. Don‚Äôt be a stranger.‚Äù

Kenji returned to his quiet apartment and sat down in his chair. Nothing had changed. He was still unemployed. His bank account was the same. His problems were all still there, waiting for him. But the crushing weight on his chest had lifted. The roaring silence in his head had quieted to a manageable hum. He felt‚Ä¶ better. Restored.

A final, internal memo from the Weaver scrolled through his consciousness, precise and emotionless as a lab report.

`Experiment Log: Concluded. No resources were exchanged. No strategic advantages were gained. The subject's external problems remain unsolved. However, physiological and psychological markers indicate a significant decrease in stress and an increase in emotional fortitude. The variable ‚Äòshared empathic presence‚Äô has produced a tangible, restorative effect that defies all transactional and utilitarian logic. Phenomenon recorded.

I‚Äôm not in college right now, just working and trying to figure out what the best next move is. I live in a mid-sized US city where small food spots can do pretty well if placed right, and delivery gigs are super common too.

Here‚Äôs the situation:

**Option 1:** Start a small coffee cart. I found a decent deal on a mobile setup through Facebook Marketplace, and there‚Äôs a local flea market and farmers‚Äô market where I could rent a weekend spot. I‚Äôve been practicing recipes and people seem to like them. But it‚Äôs a gamble I‚Äôd be putting almost everything I have into it, and if it flops, I‚Äôm back to zero.

**Option 2:** Buy a reliable used car (like a 2008-2011 Toyota) and start doing Uber Eats, DoorDash, etc full-time. It‚Äôs less exciting but more predictable. I already have a license, and I know I could pull in at least some daily income immediately. But it‚Äôs kind of just trading time for money again, and long-term it might burn me out.

I‚Äôm leaning toward the coffee cart because it feels like building something that‚Äôs mine. But I‚Äôm scared of losing my savings and having no backup. I don‚Äôt come from money, so if I screw this up, there‚Äôs no financial cushion.

Just to be frank, I don't know if I am depressed, if I am right on this subreddit, but the past few days have been tough. It's the first days since around a year I don't really have anything besides the cycling to distract myself with. No computer games, no work to throw myself into, no friends that occupy my time. Just me, myself, and I.

And I don't know how to handle that at the moment. I wanted this trip to get to know myself again, to learn what I want from life. But at the moment I just feel empty, could not tell you what I am actually feeling, no idea. I am going through the motions, waking up in the morning, making coffee and breakfast, riding through utterly beautiful nature, and it just leaves me cold.

No idea how to describe it more. I'll definitely want to get some therapy when back home. But I also don't want to cancel the trip, I still think it should be good for me and it's better than sitting in front of the computer back home. 

What do I want from this post? Ranting a bit, definitely. But maybe someone else has taken a break from normal life and had similar problems, can tell me about their experience, maybe I can learn from that",4,1753601123.0,depression,2,1.0,False

This full-day adventure really gives you the perfect taste of what the island has to offer.

I researched quite a few tours before settling on this one (which you can check out here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island) and it definitely delivered on showcasing the best spots around the island in one convenient day.

Our guide picked us up right on time from Waikiki at 7 AM in a comfortable air-conditioned bus. Starting early helped us beat the crowds at popular stops. The first highlight was catching the morning light at Diamond Head lookout - perfect for photos without harsh shadows.

One thing I really appreciated was how our guide shared fascinating cultural insights and local stories throughout the drive. It wasn't just a boring list of facts, but genuine knowledge that helped us understand Hawaii better.

The Halona Blowhole was spectacular - we got lucky and saw it shooting water 30 feet high! The Nu'uanu Pali Lookout offered breathtaking views of the windward coast, though hold onto your hat because it gets super windy up there.

A major highlight was visiting Waimea Valley. The botanical gardens are stunning, and the waterfall swim was refreshing after walking in the tropical heat. Pro tip: wear your swimsuit under your clothes and bring water shoes if you have them.

The North Shore portion was excellent - we stopped at famous beaches like Sunset Beach and had the most amazing garlic shrimp for lunch from one of the food trucks. Our guide knew exactly which truck had the best food without tourist trap prices.

We also enjoyed free samples at Tropical Farms (the coffee and macadamia nuts are delicious) and made a final stop at Dole Plantation. Yes, the Dole Whip lives up to the hype!

What made this tour stand out was the perfect balance of activities. You get scenic views, cultural sites, swimming opportunities, and food experiences without feeling rushed. The maximum group size of 24 means you're not lost in a huge crowd either.

If you're planning to book (which I highly recommend), here are some quick tips:
- Bring cash for lunch and tips
- Wear comfortable walking shoes
- Pack sunscreen and a light jacket
- Bring a change of clothes if you plan to swim
- Don't forget your camera!

The tour costs $154 per person, which initially seemed a bit high, but considering it includes transportation, admission fees, and an expert guide for 8 hours, it's actually great value. You can book with free cancellation up to 24 hours before through this link: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island

After experiencing it myself, I understand why it maintains a 4.8/5 rating from thousands of reviews. It's the perfect way to see Oahu's highlights if you're short on time or don't want to deal with rental cars and planning routes yourself.

Let me know if you have any questions about the tour - happy to help fellow travelers make the most of their Hawaii experience!",1,1753600907.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

When I was in high school and college, I could pretty much eat whatever I wanted and not put on any weight. Part of it was a fast metabolism, and part of it was likely due to the fact that I did dance in high school and did lots of walking around campus in college.

Now that I've got a desk job and my own disposable income, I've found myself putting on weight. Since I kind of hate exercising, I've been relying mostly on maintaining a calorie deficit in order to lose the weight. 

The problem is that I'm really struggling to keep under 1550 cals a day. I'm someone who loves trying food from new places, and I can't bring myself to pick a potentially healthier item on the menu when there's something else I know I'd really enjoy. I'm also a bit addicted to what I call ""treat drinks"", which include things like coffee drinks, bubble tea, flavored energy drinks, etc. All not particularly healthy habits I know, but sometimes looking forward to some tasty takeout or a treat drink is what helps me get through the day.

Recently, I've been able to consistently keep to around 1600 calories a day with one or two cheat days a week--but it's clearly not cutting it since my weight has stayed pretty much stagnant.

If anyone who has been in a similar situation to mine has any tips, they'd be much appreciated. Whether it be exercises that are less painstaking or ways to help keep the calories down.

Cheesy as it may sounds and I know that love waits, I think I'm in the mood to seek out the one I've been waiting for. I'm down to get to know someone and see if there's chemistry.

I'm more into a slow-burn, thoughtful, and genuine dating. Let me into your mind, explore different parts of your soul, and show me the insecurities you've been trying to hide (don't worry, I won't judge your humanity). And I hope you can equally return the curiosity as well.


About me:
- I'm currently living in manila but I'm originally from south luzon.

- undergrad student (it's kind of a complicated story)

- I don't have a permanent hobby since I believe I like to explore and try out different things. The things I did before (or re-occurring) are playing badminton, swimming, bowling, running, gym/working out, going to a cafe to either people watch or read a book, explore different places I've never been before, going to chill/party bars, and going to museums or walk around anywhere that is peaceful.

- I believe I have a creative side and an appreciation to art and music. I like watching movie/tv series dissecting video essays on youtube, and discovering new songs.

- I'm a conversationalist. I can thrive just by us sitting down, having a cup of coffee or an alcoholic drink, and conversing to various topics. I'm an active listener, and easy to talk to. They say I'm good in making people comfortable , wanna test it out if it's true? Hahaha

- I'm not fond of shallow topics, they bore me and I already know how our conversation will end. However, don't be mistaken. I like goofy/silly convos, brainrot/dark humor memes. I like sending memes and reels.

- I'm an ambivert but I feel like I'm leaning more into being an introvert. Although I believe I can ride to any type of crowd, I still have a social battery.

- Low maintenance but I can get very busy sometimes, so I hope that's okay with you. Although I will always make time and spend time with you.

- I'm a foodie, I love trying out different dishes I haven't tried before. Even though I'm a bit picky with food, I'm down to eat street foods with you.

- I have a maarte side, but I know when to be maarte and when to compromise.

- I believe I'm a mature person and have an emotional maturity.

- I'm a Born-Again, Christian. Although I'm not very religious, I still respect my religion and would want to have a worship service/church date with you.

- I'm a hygienic person, I smell good, I like to dress appropriately depending on the place/occassion, I'm a 5'4 morena and in my normal bmi, and people say I'm attractive. I receive compliments, especially my eyes. I don't know if the compliments I receive about my eyes are true though hahaha I don't see it eh hahahaha

- I'm an INTJ, if you're into that.

- I'm respectful, kind, open-minded (not in that way okay?), and caring. I love looking out to people I care about.


About you:
- male
- around 22-28 years old
- student/working professional
- lives in metro manila or from the south. Sorry, I don't like LDR :(
- takes care of himself/keeping himself healthy
- Attractive. Let's not pretend physical attractiveness isn't real or of least importance. You don't have to be conventionally attractive, I just hope you are attractive in my eyes.
- taller than me (pls pls pls) I've dated men shorter than me. Believe me, I gave my lovely short kings a chance, it didn't work out huhu :((
- has the same interests as I do
- caring, kind, and respectful as I am too
- someone I can go out with in chill/party bars since I'm into partying (not every time tho! Just sometimes since I like chill bars too)
- emotionally mature, knows how to solve problems with me, and when to compromise.
- into slow-burn romance
- I think I don't have much specific things that I'm looking for. All I want is that I hope we get along and eventually click. So feel free to shoot your shot! :)

I think that's all for now! DM me your self introduction and we can exchange pics on telegram so that we don't have to waste our time if we think there's no attraction between us. I will not entertain people who only messages ""hi"", ""hello"", or any kind of simple, low-effort messages. If you've messaged before, feel free to message again!

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve finalized so far:

* **Target audience**: Students, walkers, morning/evening foot traffic
* **Setup**: Minimal design, cart or shipping container-style stall
* **Location**: Likely a rented open space near residential area
* **Goal**: Affordable, quick-serve coffee (hot and iced), small menu

I‚Äôd love your thoughts on the following:

1. **Does the location seems appropriate, I see a lot of footfall from college students and residents there?**
2. **I want to make authentic coffee here, not sugary cold coffees but i don't know if there is enough audience for that, What menu do you suggest ?**
3. **Should i make it coffee or i should include chai too ?**
4. **Is it worth offering a few snacks (cookies/muffins) or stick to only beverages at first?**
5. **Any name suggestions or branding tips that have stuck with you from great coffee spots?**

Bonus: If you‚Äôre from Delhi, I‚Äôd love any tips on good locations (college areas, parks, walkways, etc.).

Grew up conservative, so I drew some hard lines: never drank, never smoked weed, never slept around. (Nicotine is my one vice.) I wanted to stay clean for marriage.

Two relationships so far, no sex:

	1.	Relationship #1 ‚Äì My ‚Äúfirst everything.‚Äù I knew our values clashed (she drank/smoked) but the chemistry was crazy, so I stayed longer than I should have.

	2.	Relationship #2 ‚Äì Looked perfect on paper: values, goals, ‚Äúwife material.‚Äù Our personalities just didn‚Äôt click. It taught me box-checking ‚â† emotional fit, and even shifted a former ‚Äúnon-negotiables‚Äù down to ‚Äúnice to have.‚Äù

Since then, I feel blunted. Prayer feels flat, hugs feel flat. I sometimes wonder,not suicidally  ‚ÄúIf I vanished tomorrow, would it even ripple?‚Äù Yet I keep going, almost robotically.

Social stats:

	‚Ä¢	Awkward eye contact, overthink every word.
	‚Ä¢	Ask myself, ‚ÄúIf I were her, would I pick me?‚Äù The answer shifts daily.
	‚Ä¢	Physical attraction matters to me (maybe too much). I can build love without it, but it‚Äôs complicated.

Life stats:

	‚Ä¢	Remote tech role good because I play to my strengths, bad because I hide.
	‚Ä¢	Mental fog + weight-loss struggle (trying to get lean, consistency is a fight).
	‚Ä¢	Parents are having a rough patch; dad‚Äôs overseas for a while, I‚Äôm home with mom & siblings trying to help.

Identity tug-of-war: Traditional Arab son vs. American-raised guy carving his own lane. Proud some days, isolated others most friends tried weed/drank; I never did.


Curveball: I recently met someone who does tick many of my boxes, but I‚Äôm second-guessing every text. I freeze the moment conversation shifts from funny memes to anything personal, and my eye contact turns robotic. I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll blow it before we even grab coffee.

What I need from you

	‚Ä¢	If you‚Äôve felt emotionally numb after breakups, what actually switched your heart back on?
	‚Ä¢	From strong cultural/religious backgrounds: how did you date/marry without losing yourself?
	‚Ä¢	Guys: how do you value physical attraction without letting it sabotage deeper connection?
	‚Ä¢	Fellow awkward humans: what specific habit, script, or drill moved the social needle? (Please skip ‚Äújust be confident.‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	Spiritually: when prayer felt empty, how did you reconnect without faking it?

I'm shaking as I type this because I'm so angry but also confused about whether I have the right to be angry.

For context: My husband Mark (32M) and I (29F) have been married for 2 years. His mom Linda has always been... involved. She has strong opinions about how we should live our lives but usually keeps them to herself-ish.

Yesterday I had to work late - didn't get home until almost 8pm. I walk into my kitchen and literally nothing is where I left it. The coffee maker is on the opposite counter, all my spices are reorganized alphabetically, my dishes are in completely different cabinets, even my refrigerator contents are rearranged.

I thought we'd been robbed by the world's most organized burglar.

Turns out Linda had come over to ""help out"" while Mark was also at work. She used her spare key (which we gave her for emergencies) and decided my kitchen was ""inefficient"" and needed to be ""optimized.""

She moved EVERYTHING. I couldn't find the salt for my dinner. My coffee routine this morning was a disaster because nothing was where it should be.

When I called Mark upset, he said ""well, she was just trying to help"" and ""you have to admit the spice organization makes more sense."" When I said this was a violation of our space, he accused me of being ""dramatic"" and said I should be grateful someone cleaned our kitchen.

But here's the thing - it wasn't dirty! It was organized the way I liked it, the way that worked for ME in MY kitchen.

Linda thinks she did us a huge favor. Mark thinks I'm overreacting. Am I losing my mind here?",177,1753599359.0,TwoHotTakes,98,0.97,False

I want to go to school for automotive paint and body. It's something I was good and it makes dam good money. We had a deal that once you were done with school that I would get to go. I hope one day you will choose to help do that. 

I want to buy a piece of land. Just an acre would be fine. Something that is mine and in my name. Something that can't be taken away and I can't be forced to move away. 

I want to put one of those tiny home cabins on it. I've been looking and they are really extraordinary. You can get them fully furnished and the interior complete or you can get them bare bones. I don't know which I would do but I can figure that out later. If I had the ability I'd get it with the interior complete. 

I want something to be proud of. Something that is mine and won't leave me. Something I can put care and work into. Something that can grow with me as time goes by. 

I want you there by my side. I'd love for you to be there from the start. So that it is our home and our sanctity. Filled with our individual personalities. Our energies working together. 

I know what your thinking and yes I thought the same. The space is to small. Although it isn't. These things are dam near the size of a common house. The space is just used more efficiently. 

Then you grow the space with add on's. Like a covered porch and a carport. A seperate building for storage. And even a small guest room building. By the time you get done you have a little compound. Built in my head around a ornate fire circle and outdoor grilling kitchen area. You know how I love to cook outside and use any excuse to have a get together.

I'd love your help in designing this all and in picking the home. You have a natural knack for those kinds of things. One of your many extraordinary talents. When you get the vision in your head your all the gusto of Betty homemaker. It is sweet and beautiful. You put so much care into your sacred space. I miss that about you. I miss being along for the ride. I miss our projects and the chaos of preparing the house together before cookouts, get togethers, and holiday feast. It was so much work and at the end we'd be exhausted but it was so emotionally fulfilling. 

I want a space for your many cookbooks. To be on display. Just as I want a book shelf to hold all our books. Like a how to guide to understand us just by looking and the tittles. I want plates and dishes that we each pick that show our differences. I don't want to fight about our differences anymore. I want a specific bowl for my ramen noodle addiction. One that you pick for me like before. I want sets of beautiful chops sticks that never get thrown away. I want us to have our specific coffee mugs. Ones we pick for each other. I want my collection of high grade knives. One for every kitchen scenario. I definitely want a place for really good pot holders to always be there so that you won't burn yourself every time you cook. I want you to have a space for a nice writing desk. One you paint and design on your own like the Alice in Wonderland one you made. Even though you do most of your writing in bed. 

I want soft t-shirt material sheets. With a big thick heavy comforter, and a super soft cuddle blanket at the foot. I miss the the rocking horse fly that stayed on  the armoire. So that's has to be there to. I want a huge TV . With a great sound system. One that will play all over the house if we choose. I want to walk in with you singing to a spoon and white flour handprints on your ass. White flour in your hair and on your nose. So dam adorably cute. Red faced and embarrassed you have been caught. I want windows placed in the right spot so in the morning when the rays of the sun hit your face and hair I can see that shine that you are that takes my breath away. The one that drives me mad with the choice to cuddle you, or exhaust your body. I want a mirror on the ceiling. One where I can watch you in intimate moments weather it be moments of passion or just you laying on my chest while I rub your naked back and play with your hair.  Maybe a place made secretly where I get to restrain you. Maybe even restraint points built into the bed. I want a small electric coaster that will always keep your coffee warm when I bring it to you. With a place on the wall for a small handheld vacuum for when we inevitably make our messes.  I want you to have a place in the closet with all your arts and craft supplies. I want to watch paint on a easel and wonder what world you will create. What story is in your head that goes with it. Maybe we should start writing them down together and see what we create. 

I want a beautiful shower with all the bells and whistles. One place where space is not cramped in any way. I want to be able to hold you and love you there. I miss washing your hair and watching you drift off to someplace serene. I miss being so enraptured watching you that I just take you right there. I miss when you would ask me to join you on your way to the shower. That feeling of elation that you wanted my presence. Did you know back then when you stopped asking me how much it affected me? I want a large basin sink and a well lit mirror. A place for all your girl stuff and our hygiene. I want holders for our razors in the shower and a mirror there to shave by. I want a really great detachable shower head. One that I might walk in and catch you using. ""Here Sweetness let me do that for you"". I want there to be a tub too and I haven't figured out how to do that but maybe you can. I mean we could always make an outdoor tub with a privacy wall. Somewhere to watch the sunsets and moon rises.  One where I can soak in the tub with you. You laying against my chest. Where I can massage your shoulders and relieve your stress in many ways. I want to have you stretch out so I can shave your body being ever so careful that I have to pay attention to every detail that makes you. So that I can be reminded how very precious you are always.  I want a cabinet full of large fluffy towels and a place on the wall that will hold three not two, because you always want one for your hair. I want a seat in that shower. A place for you to hold yourself up when I am busy behind you, or when you decide to sit on my lap. I want a heater built into the wall because you hate the cold when you step out of the shower. I want places for our bath robes even though we barely use them. 

I want a place for us to have a pool table, and a dart board. Something for us to compete at. Something to make inappropriate bets over. I want to take you on the rich green felt of that table and see the contrast to your skin and hair against it. I want a neon bar sign that puts off a gentle sexy glow. A place to  hold your tequila strawberry margaritas and my Jack Daniels Honey. A small blender where I can mix your drinks. Better add a Keurig too for coffee knowing you. A small snack bar with our favorites. Your chedder Sour cream ruffles and slim Jim's. My beef jerky and pork skins. Let's not forget the small fridge for your bud light and my corona with lime. I want a chase lounge there and the music to be loud enough to cover your screams if need be. But this is our place and there will never need be. This is our sacred space and our sanctity and if we choose to invite anyone to share it or to play then they can just deal with our noise. One last thing I want. This one is strange but I have always wanted to make love to you one a throw made of rabbit fur. Makes sense  You've follower the Whit Rabbit long enough. Let us celebrate on his fur when you catch him. One we could throw in the floor in front of the fireplace or take back to our bed and pretend we are some ancient Viking warriors. Maybe we will be reliving a past life together. Fyrehrt and Kelly the Beautiful Warrior. The Kind and his shield maiden Queen. His Empress Magnificent in all things. Let's celebrate our victories. You can drink from my horn, and I will stir your cauldron. Fire and water make steam remember that. 

I want to decorate the holy place that is our own and to incorporate all the things you love. Alice in Wonderland, Gone with the Wind, and stuff from the pieces of our lives. I want every square inch of the place to be filled with positive energy and joy. I want it be filled with scents that bring you comfort and always make you relax. Vanilla , coco butter, cinnamon, and coffee. Warm Spiced Apple Cider even though you don't like actually drinking it. So I will drink it for you while you enjoy your Death Wish coffee strong and black like always. I never want there be a reason again for you to be triggered. I want to spend the rest of my life making up to you for all that you have suffered. I don't need you to do that for me but if you even tried a little how much of me you could have. That's a lie really. You know you already have me. You know that in these words. 

 I want a place for your degree in the wall. Something anyone can see and be proud of for you. I want to always remember those days and nights and the hard work we did together so that your dream could come true. I know I had my reservations about it but I always supported you in that dream. Just because I was scared to loose you doesn't mean I am not still so dam proud of you. Right beside of that degree on the wall I want our marriage certificate and one of the invitations we made together. The only other thing I have ever been so proud of. The only thing I think is as special as your degree. We worked so hard to pull of that night of magical Wonderland. I am sorry I messed that night up too. One thing all of this has taught me is that my pride can easily rob me of all that I cherish. So life took away my pride and my ego. So that I could find out what really is important. 

I want a fireplace to sit by and read with you. I want to read to each other from our favorite books. I want to sit there and  cuddle together by it's warmth looking at pictures of our lives greatest moments and our kids. I want to lay you down there and love you sweetly. Taking my time and savoring every inch of your body. I want to kiss your neck and savor the taste of your fire warmed sweat. I want to explore your kiss often and always remember that it isn't promised forever. So that I use every opportunity to savor it more while I can. I want to feel the heat of the fire reflect off the inside of your thighs as I busy myself exploring you there. I want all of  you to cover my face. I want you to taste what I love so much when I kiss you again and again. Even when we are old and grey. I want to hear the snap and pop of the fire and have it  ignite something primal in us. I want to lay there naked and without shame putting on a show in celebration for the gods that have brought us together again. I promise you the task is not to daunting and I will endeavor to please the gods just as I please your body and become the balm to your soul. I will calm your storm and I will bring you back there again and again to keep it away.

 When your demons come calling I want to show them what we have built together. I want to show them that this is our sacred space and they may be welcome to watch us from outside but no longer will they sup at our table while plotting our demise. They no longer will have access to you. I will stand guard at the gate of your heart. I will never relinquish the key. I didn't know then how to be the man you needed me to be. I didn't understand those demons were real. I didn't know I needed to be your knight in shining armor. You told me you didn't need me to be your hero. So many things you told me were untrue. So many things that were meant to hide your true feelings. All this has happened since and because of it I have learned to see. I will combat them with love. The love of my presence. The love of my attention. The love of my touch and the love of my desire and passion. You can't fight evil with evil. You only open the door and create more evil in the world. I will fight with love and honor. I will always sanctify the vows we took and both failed to take literally.

 There by the door I want your Alice in Wonderland book safe that contains the cords of Black, White, Silver,and Blue that bind us together handfasted for eternity. I want that to dispell any hex upon us or our home. Just like I want a ring upon your finger to do the same. I don't know if you still have it. If you don't I will replace it with one that is better bought from the sweat of my brow. I will work longer and harder and so make it more worthy to you so that you never remove it again. No I am not speaking unfairly to you. I know you loved that ring and my actions devalued it. Not it's cost. I accept that and if loosing it forever is the penalty then I will remake it in actions just as I unmade it. Did you not know that is it's purpose? It is a ward from evil. Not a symbol of possession. A sacred circle of white gold upon your finger. Did you know I sanctified it in moonlight and cleansed it with salt water charged by that light. Then I charged it with water from the river behind our home and truly made it yours. Did you know I slept with it in my hand for three nights. A rubber band holding my hand closed. I did this on night your were not home and woke with my hand numb and bloodless. A small price to pay. I poured all of myself into that ring. Everything I wanted us to be and all the love I had.  When you didn't take my name and you removed the ring all the protection was gone. All my belief in myself disappeared. I know that wasn't your intent. It's just how it happened. That ring haunts me every single day of my life. As if to shame me for the things I have done and the pain I have caused you. I've never loved jewelry. It was always something just nice to have. But dammed if I didn't love that ring. There was a part of me in it. I think you knew that and it's why you had to take it off. You couldn't shut down inside as long as you were wearing that ring. It was alive with my own essence and the magic soaked into it that we make when we are together. I don't blame you. I didn't uphold the the intentions that were placed in that ring. I failed myself and I failed you. I failed the ring. It's not a mistake I will ever make again. 

So now you know. The plan. I don't know if this competes with your own. I don't know if it would devalue the things you have built for yourself in my absence. It's not something that can't be redefined. I simply wanted you to know what I envision. There was a time when you strove to make things like this that were important to me happen. Although in this it is me that needs to do the majority of the work. It is me that has to make those steps to make it happen if it is to be a reality. Although I welcome your support and encouragement along the way. Just knowing you felt the same way or had a plan of your own would inspire me all the more. I want to build with you. Something that is ours and sacred. Our children are grown now and we have nothing to bring us together to work together for the sake of love. This could be that thing. Like we did to pull off the wedding. Like we did to get custody of my son. Like we did with your college degree.  When we actually work together great things always happened and when they didn't they never affected us much. 

I do this all the time Kelly. I live our life together in order to survive the reality that  we have become antithetical to each other. We are opposing magnets pushing each other away but not very far. Though if you slam two magnets together they will realign their poles. So maybe that's what need to happen with us. That is why I wrote ""The Cabin"". A way to slam us back together and realign our energies. The fear and anxiety we have would dispell in just a few minutes of our closeness. In the end none of it matters except the love. A simple hello, how are you, I'm sorry and a embrace and a kiss. The magnitude of healing that would flow through us is beyond imagination. Though I believe in it with all my heart. So much in us is broken because we are not near to each other. If we could agree to put away the past just for a little while and let ourselves feel what's there underneath then you would be surprised at how effortlessly alot of the healing would be. There would still be things that had to be actively pursued to fill the void that pain has left us in. It can't be all easy or we loose respect for it. But see this work isn't like work to me. Not now. Now it's my favorite thing to do. I would call it a hobby but hobbies come and go. So I call it a calling. My calling. This is what my purpose is and what I am meant to do. If not to bring us together then to help calm the storm in you. You are entitled to your path and your pain. Your entitled to the time it takes to get there. Though you and I have both had time and we should be working together to get the rest of the way. So this is a reminder that we have suffered enough. That I am ready when you are. That you don't have to do this to yourself anymore. We can do this together. Starting off safe and slow. Cautious if need be or slamming us together and aligning our energies. Sweetness I will slam with you anytime, anyplace, and anywhere. Just like the shirt in your closet says. The one I bought for you to be you might shirt when you stayed over at my place when we first got together. I don't care who watches or who sees us anymore. If the demons are outside then let them watch. I will never be ashamed to slam with you till the stars burn out and the sun doesn't rise. I would still slam with you in the dark just as nice. 

If you think I am lying then why don't you try me? Your not scared are you? Your not chicken are you? Lol. How about  I play you in pool, or in darts. Even your favorite a game of chess. I know I'd loose but if I have to loose to someone then why not for it to be you? How about Strip Chess. That should make it interesting. We could make little rules and write them on little pieces of paper. Stuffing them inside the pieces. Each time you take someone's piece you read the paper and the other person has to do what it says. Wow that could be a new favorite game for me. I think youd have fun making a clown out of me. I think Id love to see you laugh at my antics. Your laugh was so amazing. Come on Sweetness you know you wanna. I know you fancy a game. Why not take the game to the next level. We could play once a week. Eventually I'd have to win sometime right? So tell me would your ego still force you to have to win. Using your womanly wiles to disrupt my attention, or would you just loose on purpose so that we could come together and slake our need of each other? If so and it came time to walk out the door till next week would you be able to let me, or would you slam me against the door to keep from walking away and pour your willing heart into my hands along with your body? I know you want to test it. I know you want to find out. I know you want to find out it if is as real in your head and is it in your heart. You want to know if it's still there after all this time and everything that has happened. So let the games begin my Sweetness. Let's test our wills and see what our hearts have to say about it. How about a game of the silent treatment. The first one to utter a single word or sigh or scream looses. Let's time it and see how long it takes. Let's laugh about into the future when we are old and grey. I will bet then your eyes will sparkle just as much as they did then. I bet the smokey desire they have always had when I am near will still be there when our bodies betray us. I bet we still find ways to enjoy each other even then. You don't think so? Then let's test it. Honey Nicolas Sparks hasn't got shot on us. Our real life is better than any book he ever thought about writing. At least it will be when we figure this mess out.

1mafkj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LettersAnswered/comments/1mafkj8/the_plan/,The plan,"I am writing this to manifest it. 

I want to go to school for automotive paint and body. It's something I was good and it makes dam good money. We had a deal that once you were done with school that I would get to go. I hope one day you will choose to help do that. 

I want to buy a piece of land. Just an acre would be fine. Something that is mine and in my name. Something that can't be taken away and I can't be forced to move away. 

I want to put one of those tiny home cabins on it. I've been looking and they are really extraordinary. You can get them fully furnished and the interior complete or you can get them bare bones. I don't know which I would do but I can figure that out later. If I had the ability I'd get it with the interior complete. 

I want something to be proud of. Something that is mine and won't leave me. Something I can put care and work into. Something that can grow with me as time goes by. 

I want you there by my side. I'd love for you to be there from the start. So that it is our home and our sanctity. Filled with our individual personalities. Our energies working together. 

I know what your thinking and yes I thought the same. The space is to small. Although it isn't. These things are dam near the size of a common house. The space is just used more efficiently. 

Then you grow the space with add on's. Like a covered porch and a carport. A seperate building for storage. And even a small guest room building. By the time you get done you have a little compound. Built in my head around a ornate fire circle and outdoor grilling kitchen area. You know how I love to cook outside and use any excuse to have a get together.

I'd love your help in designing this all and in picking the home. You have a natural knack for those kinds of things. One of your many extraordinary talents. When you get the vision in your head your all the gusto of Betty homemaker. It is sweet and beautiful. You put so much care into your sacred space. I miss that about you. I miss being along for the ride. I miss our projects and the chaos of preparing the house together before cookouts, get togethers, and holiday feast. It was so much work and at the end we'd be exhausted but it was so emotionally fulfilling. 

I want a space for your many cookbooks. To be on display. Just as I want a book shelf to hold all our books. Like a how to guide to understand us just by looking and the tittles. I want plates and dishes that we each pick that show our differences. I don't want to fight about our differences anymore. I want a specific bowl for my ramen noodle addiction. One that you pick for me like before. I want sets of beautiful chops sticks that never get thrown away. I want us to have our specific coffee mugs. Ones we pick for each other. I want my collection of high grade knives. One for every kitchen scenario. I definitely want a place for really good pot holders to always be there so that you won't burn yourself every time you cook. I want you to have a space for a nice writing desk. One you paint and design on your own like the Alice in Wonderland one you made. Even though you do most of your writing in bed. 

I want soft t-shirt material sheets. With a big thick heavy comforter, and a super soft cuddle blanket at the foot. I miss the the rocking horse fly that stayed on  the armoire. So that's has to be there to. I want a huge TV . With a great sound system. One that will play all over the house if we choose. I want to walk in with you singing to a spoon and white flour handprints on your ass. White flour in your hair and on your nose. So dam adorably cute. Red faced and embarrassed you have been caught. I want windows placed in the right spot so in the morning when the rays of the sun hit your face and hair I can see that shine that you are that takes my breath away. The one that drives me mad with the choice to cuddle you, or exhaust your body. I want a mirror on the ceiling. One where I can watch you in intimate moments weather it be moments of passion or just you laying on my chest while I rub your naked back and play with your hair.  Maybe a place made secretly where I get to restrain you. Maybe even restraint points built into the bed. I want a small electric coaster that will always keep your coffee warm when I bring it to you. With a place on the wall for a small handheld vacuum for when we inevitably make our messes.  I want you to have a place in the closet with all your arts and craft supplies. I want to watch paint on a easel and wonder what world you will create. What story is in your head that goes with it. Maybe we should start writing them down together and see what we create. 

I want a beautiful shower with all the bells and whistles. One place where space is not cramped in any way. I want to be able to hold you and love you there. I miss washing your hair and watching you drift off to someplace serene. I miss being so enraptured watching you that I just take you right there. I miss when you would ask me to join you on your way to the shower. That feeling of elation that you wanted my presence. Did you know back then when you stopped asking me how much it affected me? I want a large basin sink and a well lit mirror. A place for all your girl stuff and our hygiene. I want holders for our razors in the shower and a mirror there to shave by. I want a really great detachable shower head. One that I might walk in and catch you using. ""Here Sweetness let me do that for you"". I want there to be a tub too and I haven't figured out how to do that but maybe you can. I mean we could always make an outdoor tub with a privacy wall. Somewhere to watch the sunsets and moon rises.  One where I can soak in the tub with you. You laying against my chest. Where I can massage your shoulders and relieve your stress in many ways. I want to have you stretch out so I can shave your body being ever so careful that I have to pay attention to every detail that makes you. So that I can be reminded how very precious you are always.  I want a cabinet full of large fluffy towels and a place on the wall that will hold three not two, because you always want one for your hair. I want a seat in that shower. A place for you to hold yourself up when I am busy behind you, or when you decide to sit on my lap. I want a heater built into the wall because you hate the cold when you step out of the shower. I want places for our bath robes even though we barely use them. 

I want a place for us to have a pool table, and a dart board. Something for us to compete at. Something to make inappropriate bets over. I want to take you on the rich green felt of that table and see the contrast to your skin and hair against it. I want a neon bar sign that puts off a gentle sexy glow. A place to  hold your tequila strawberry margaritas and my Jack Daniels Honey. A small blender where I can mix your drinks. Better add a Keurig too for coffee knowing you. A small snack bar with our favorites. Your chedder Sour cream ruffles and slim Jim's. My beef jerky and pork skins. Let's not forget the small fridge for your bud light and my corona with lime. I want a chase lounge there and the music to be loud enough to cover your screams if need be. But this is our place and there will never need be. This is our sacred space and our sanctity and if we choose to invite anyone to share it or to play then they can just deal with our noise. One last thing I want. This one is strange but I have always wanted to make love to you one a throw made of rabbit fur. Makes sense  You've follower the Whit Rabbit long enough. Let us celebrate on his fur when you catch him. One we could throw in the floor in front of the fireplace or take back to our bed and pretend we are some ancient Viking warriors. Maybe we will be reliving a past life together. Fyrehrt and Kelly the Beautiful Warrior. The Kind and his shield maiden Queen. His Empress Magnificent in all things. Let's celebrate our victories. You can drink from my horn, and I will stir your cauldron. Fire and water make steam remember that. 

I want to decorate the holy place that is our own and to incorporate all the things you love. Alice in Wonderland, Gone with the Wind, and stuff from the pieces of our lives. I want every square inch of the place to be filled with positive energy and joy. I want it be filled with scents that bring you comfort and always make you relax. Vanilla , coco butter, cinnamon, and coffee. Warm Spiced Apple Cider even though you don't like actually drinking it. So I will drink it for you while you enjoy your Death Wish coffee strong and black like always. I never want there be a reason again for you to be triggered. I want to spend the rest of my life making up to you for all that you have suffered. I don't need you to do that for me but if you even tried a little how much of me you could have. That's a lie really. You know you already have me. You know that in these words. 

 I want a place for your degree in the wall. Something anyone can see and be proud of for you. I want to always remember those days and nights and the hard work we did together so that your dream could come true. I know I had my reservations about it but I always supported you in that dream. Just because I was scared to loose you doesn't mean I am not still so dam proud of you. Right beside of that degree on the wall I want our marriage certificate and one of the invitations we made together. The only other thing I have ever been so proud of. The only thing I think is as special as your degree. We worked so hard to pull of that night of magical Wonderland. I am sorry I messed that night up too. One thing all of this has taught me is that my pride can easily rob me of all that I cherish. So life took away my pride and my ego. So that I could find out what really is important. 

I want a fireplace to sit by and read with you. I want to read to each other from our favorite books. I want to sit there and  cuddle together by it's warmth looking at pictures of our lives greatest moments and our kids. I want to lay you down there and love you sweetly. Taking my time and savoring every inch of your body. I want to kiss your neck and savor the taste of your fire warmed sweat. I want to explore your kiss often and always remember that it isn't promised forever. So that I use every opportunity to savor it more while I can. I want to feel the heat of the fire reflect off the inside of your thighs as I busy myself exploring you there. I want all of  you to cover my face. I want you to taste what I love so much when I kiss you again and again. Even when we are old and grey. I want to hear the snap and pop of the fire and have it  ignite something primal in us. I want to lay there naked and without shame putting on a show in celebration for the gods that have brought us together again. I promise you the task is not to daunting and I will endeavor to please the gods just as I please your body and become the balm to your soul. I will calm your storm and I will bring you back there again and again to keep it away.

 When your demons come calling I want to show them what we have built together. I want to show them that this is our sacred space and they may be welcome to watch us from outside but no longer will they sup at our table while plotting our demise. They no longer will have access to you. I will stand guard at the gate of your heart. I will never relinquish the key. I didn't know then how to be the man you needed me to be. I didn't understand those demons were real. I didn't know I needed to be your knight in shining armor. You told me you didn't need me to be your hero. So many things you told me were untrue. So many things that were meant to hide your true feelings. All this has happened since and because of it I have learned to see. I will combat them with love. The love of my presence. The love of my attention. The love of my touch and the love of my desire and passion. You can't fight evil with evil. You only open the door and create more evil in the world. I will fight with love and honor. I will always sanctify the vows we took and both failed to take literally.

 There by the door I want your Alice in Wonderland book safe that contains the cords of Black, White, Silver,and Blue that bind us together handfasted for eternity. I want that to dispell any hex upon us or our home. Just like I want a ring upon your finger to do the same. I don't know if you still have it. If you don't I will replace it with one that is better bought from the sweat of my brow. I will work longer and harder and so make it more worthy to you so that you never remove it again. No I am not speaking unfairly to you. I know you loved that ring and my actions devalued it. Not it's cost. I accept that and if loosing it forever is the penalty then I will remake it in actions just as I unmade it. Did you not know that is it's purpose? It is a ward from evil. Not a symbol of possession. A sacred circle of white gold upon your finger. Did you know I sanctified it in moonlight and cleansed it with salt water charged by that light. Then I charged it with water from the river behind our home and truly made it yours. Did you know I slept with it in my hand for three nights. A rubber band holding my hand closed. I did this on night your were not home and woke with my hand numb and bloodless. A small price to pay. I poured all of myself into that ring. Everything I wanted us to be and all the love I had.  When you didn't take my name and you removed the ring all the protection was gone. All my belief in myself disappeared. I know that wasn't your intent. It's just how it happened. That ring haunts me every single day of my life. As if to shame me for the things I have done and the pain I have caused you. I've never loved jewelry. It was always something just nice to have. But dammed if I didn't love that ring. There was a part of me in it. I think you knew that and it's why you had to take it off. You couldn't shut down inside as long as you were wearing that ring. It was alive with my own essence and the magic soaked into it that we make when we are together. I don't blame you. I didn't uphold the the intentions that were placed in that ring. I failed myself and I failed you. I failed the ring. It's not a mistake I will ever make again. 

So now you know. The plan. I don't know if this competes with your own. I don't know if it would devalue the things you have built for yourself in my absence. It's not something that can't be redefined. I simply wanted you to know what I envision. There was a time when you strove to make things like this that were important to me happen. Although in this it is me that needs to do the majority of the work. It is me that has to make those steps to make it happen if it is to be a reality. Although I welcome your support and encouragement along the way. Just knowing you felt the same way or had a plan of your own would inspire me all the more. I want to build with you. Something that is ours and sacred. Our children are grown now and we have nothing to bring us together to work together for the sake of love. This could be that thing. Like we did to pull off the wedding. Like we did to get custody of my son. Like we did with your college degree.  When we actually work together great things always happened and when they didn't they never affected us much. 

I do this all the time Kelly. I live our life together in order to survive the reality that  we have become antithetical to each other. We are opposing magnets pushing each other away but not very far. Though if you slam two magnets together they will realign their poles. So maybe that's what need to happen with us.

How about a game of the silent treatment. The first one to utter a single word or sigh or scream looses. Let's time it and see how long it takes. Let's laugh about into the future when we are old and grey. I will bet then your eyes will sparkle just as much as they did then. I bet the smokey desire they have always had when I am near will still be there when our bodies betray us. I bet we still find ways to enjoy each other even then. You don't think so?

Built in my head around a ornate fire circle and outdoor grilling kitchen area. You know how I love to cook outside and use any excuse to have a get together.

I'd love your help in designing this all and in picking the home. You have a natural knack for those kinds of things. One of your many extraordinary talents. When you get the vision in your head your all the gusto of Betty homemaker. It is sweet and beautiful. You put so much care into your sacred space. I miss that about you. I miss being along for the ride. I miss our projects and the chaos of preparing the house together before cookouts, get togethers, and holiday feast. It was so much work and at the end we'd be exhausted but it was so emotionally fulfilling. 

I want a space for your many cookbooks. To be on display. Just as I want a book shelf to hold all our books. Like a how to guide to understand us just by looking and the tittles. I want plates and dishes that we each pick that show our differences. I don't want to fight about our differences anymore. I want a specific bowl for my ramen noodle addiction. One that you pick for me like before. I want sets of beautiful chops sticks that never get thrown away. I want us to have our specific coffee mugs. Ones we pick for each other. I want my collection of high grade knives. One for every kitchen scenario. I definitely want a place for really good pot holders to always be there so that you won't burn yourself every time you cook. I want you to have a space for a nice writing desk. One you paint and design on your own like the Alice in Wonderland one you made. Even though you do most of your writing in bed. 

I want soft t-shirt material sheets. With a big thick heavy comforter, and a super soft cuddle blanket at the foot. I miss the the rocking horse fly that stayed on  the armoire. So that's has to be there to. I want a huge TV . With a great sound system. One that will play all over the house if we choose. I want to walk in with you singing to a spoon and white flour handprints on your ass. White flour in your hair and on your nose. So dam adorably cute. Red faced and embarrassed you have been caught. I want windows placed in the right spot so in the morning when the rays of the sun hit your face and hair I can see that shine that you are that takes my breath away. The one that drives me mad with the choice to cuddle you, or exhaust your body. I want a mirror on the ceiling. One where I can watch you in intimate moments weather it be moments of passion or just you laying on my chest while I rub your naked back and play with your hair.  Maybe a place made secretly where I get to restrain you. Maybe even restraint points built into the bed. I want a small electric coaster that will always keep your coffee warm when I bring it to you. With a place on the wall for a small handheld vacuum for when we inevitably make our messes.  I want you to have a place in the closet with all your arts and craft supplies. I want to watch paint on a easel and wonder what world you will create. What story is in your head that goes with it. Maybe we should start writing them down together and see what we create. 

I want a beautiful shower with all the bells and whistles. One place where space is not cramped in any way. I want to be able to hold you and love you there. I miss washing your hair and watching you drift off to someplace serene. I miss being so enraptured watching you that I just take you right there. I miss when you would ask me to join you on your way to the shower. That feeling of elation that you wanted my presence. Did you know back then when you stopped asking me how much it affected me? I want a large basin sink and a well lit mirror. A place for all your girl stuff and our hygiene. I want holders for our razors in the shower and a mirror there to shave by. I want a really great detachable shower head. One that I might walk in and catch you using. ""Here Sweetness let me do that for you"". I want there to be a tub too and I haven't figured out how to do that but maybe you can. I mean we could always make an outdoor tub with a privacy wall. Somewhere to watch the sunsets and moon rises.  One where I can soak in the tub with you. You laying against my chest. Where I can massage your shoulders and relieve your stress in many ways. I want to have you stretch out so I can shave your body being ever so careful that I have to pay attention to every detail that makes you. So that I can be reminded how very precious you are always.  I want a cabinet full of large fluffy towels and a place on the wall that will hold three not two, because you always want one for your hair. I want a seat in that shower. A place for you to hold yourself up when I am busy behind you, or when you decide to sit on my lap. I want a heater built into the wall because you hate the cold when you step out of the shower. I want places for our bath robes even though we barely use them. 

I want a place for us to have a pool table, and a dart board. Something for us to compete at. Something to make inappropriate bets over. I want to take you on the rich green felt of that table and see the contrast to your skin and hair against it. I want a neon bar sign that puts off a gentle sexy glow. A place to  hold your tequila strawberry margaritas and my Jack Daniels Honey. A small blender where I can mix your drinks. Better add a Keurig too for coffee knowing you. A small snack bar with our favorites. Your chedder Sour cream ruffles and slim Jim's. My beef jerky and pork skins. Let's not forget the small fridge for your bud light and my corona with lime. I want a chase lounge there and the music to be loud enough to cover your screams if need be. But this is our place and there will never need be. This is our sacred space and our sanctity and if we choose to invite anyone to share it or to play then they can just deal with our noise. One last thing I want. This one is strange but I have always wanted to make love to you one a throw made of rabbit fur. Makes sense  You've follower the Whit Rabbit long enough. Let us celebrate on his fur when you catch him. One we could throw in the floor in front of the fireplace or take back to our bed and pretend we are some ancient Viking warriors. Maybe we will be reliving a past life together. Fyrehrt and Kelly the Beautiful Warrior. The Kind and his shield maiden Queen. His Empress Magnificent in all things. Let's celebrate our victories. You can drink from my horn, and I will stir your cauldron. Fire and water make steam remember that. 

I want to decorate the holy place that is our own and to incorporate all the things you love. Alice in Wonderland, Gone with the Wind, and stuff from the pieces of our lives. I want every square inch of the place to be filled with positive energy and joy. I want it be filled with scents that bring you comfort and always make you relax. Vanilla , coco butter, cinnamon, and coffee. Warm Spiced Apple Cider even though you don't like actually drinking it. So I will drink it for you while you enjoy your Death Wish coffee strong and black like always. I never want there be a reason again for you to be triggered. I want to spend the rest of my life making up to you for all that you have suffered. I don't need you to do that for me but if you even tried a little how much of me you could have. That's a lie really. You know you already have me. You know that in these words. 

 I want a place for your degree in the wall. Something anyone can see and be proud of for you. I want to always remember those days and nights and the hard work we did together so that your dream could come true. I know I had my reservations about it but I always supported you in that dream. Just because I was scared to loose you doesn't mean I am not still so dam proud of you. Right beside of that degree on the wall I want our marriage certificate and one of the invitations we made together. The only other thing I have ever been so proud of. The only thing I think is as special as your degree. We worked so hard to pull of that night of magical Wonderland. I am sorry I messed that night up too. One thing all of this has taught me is that my pride can easily rob me of all that I cherish. So life took away my pride and my ego. So that I could find out what really is important. 

I want a fireplace to sit by and read with you. I want to read to each other from our favorite books. I want to sit there and  cuddle together by it's warmth looking at pictures of our lives greatest moments and our kids. I want to lay you down there and love you sweetly. Taking my time and savoring every inch of your body. I want to kiss your neck and savor the taste of your fire warmed sweat. I want to explore your kiss often and always remember that it isn't promised forever. So that I use every opportunity to savor it more while I can. I want to feel the heat of the fire reflect off the inside of your thighs as I busy myself exploring you there. I want all of  you to cover my face. I want you to taste what I love so much when I kiss you again and again. Even when we are old and grey. I want to hear the snap and pop of the fire and have it  ignite something primal in us. I want to lay there naked and without shame putting on a show in celebration for the gods that have brought us together again. I promise you the task is not to daunting and I will endeavor to please the gods just as I please your body and become the balm to your soul. I will calm your storm and I will bring you back there again and again to keep it away.

 When your demons come calling I want to show them what we have built together. I want to show them that this is our sacred space and they may be welcome to watch us from outside but no longer will they sup at our table while plotting our demise. They no longer will have access to you. I will stand guard at the gate of your heart. I will never relinquish the key. I didn't know then how to be the man you needed me to be. I didn't understand those demons were real. I didn't know I needed to be your knight in shining armor. You told me you didn't need me to be your hero. So many things you told me were untrue. So many things that were meant to hide your true feelings. All this has happened since and because of it I have learned to see. I will combat them with love. The love of my presence. The love of my attention. The love of my touch and the love of my desire and passion. You can't fight evil with evil. You only open the door and create more evil in the world. I will fight with love and honor. I will always sanctify the vows we took and both failed to take literally.

 There by the door I want your Alice in Wonderland book safe that contains the cords of Black, White, Silver,and Blue that bind us together handfasted for eternity. I want that to dispell any hex upon us or our home. Just like I want a ring upon your finger to do the same. I don't know if you still have it. If you don't I will replace it with one that is better bought from the sweat of my brow. I will work longer and harder and so make it more worthy to you so that you never remove it again. No I am not speaking unfairly to you. I know you loved that ring and my actions devalued it. Not it's cost. I accept that and if loosing it forever is the penalty then I will remake it in actions just as I unmade it. Did you not know that is it's purpose? It is a ward from evil. Not a symbol of possession. A sacred circle of white gold upon your finger. Did you know I sanctified it in moonlight and cleansed it with salt water charged by that light. Then I charged it with water from the river behind our home and truly made it yours. Did you know I slept with it in my hand for three nights. A rubber band holding my hand closed. I did this on night your were not home and woke with my hand numb and bloodless. A small price to pay. I poured all of myself into that ring. Everything I wanted us to be and all the love I had.  When you didn't take my name and you removed the ring all the protection was gone. All my belief in myself disappeared. I know that wasn't your intent. It's just how it happened. That ring haunts me every single day of my life. As if to shame me for the things I have done and the pain I have caused you. I've never loved jewelry. It was always something just nice to have. But dammed if I didn't love that ring. There was a part of me in it. I think you knew that and it's why you had to take it off. You couldn't shut down inside as long as you were wearing that ring. It was alive with my own essence and the magic soaked into it that we make when we are together. I don't blame you. I didn't uphold the the intentions that were placed in that ring. I failed myself and I failed you. I failed the ring. It's not a mistake I will ever make again. 

So now you know. The plan. I don't know if this competes with your own. I don't know if it would devalue the things you have built for yourself in my absence. It's not something that can't be redefined. I simply wanted you to know what I envision. There was a time when you strove to make things like this that were important to me happen. Although in this it is me that needs to do the majority of the work. It is me that has to make those steps to make it happen if it is to be a reality. Although I welcome your support and encouragement along the way. Just knowing you felt the same way or had a plan of your own would inspire me all the more. I want to build with you. Something that is ours and sacred. Our children are grown now and we have nothing to bring us together to work together for the sake of love. This could be that thing. Like we did to pull off the wedding. Like we did to get custody of my son. Like we did with your college degree.  When we actually work together great things always happened and when they didn't they never affected us much. 

I do this all the time Kelly. I live our life together in order to survive the reality that  we have become antithetical to each other. We are opposing magnets pushing each other away but not very far. Though if you slam two magnets together they will realign their poles. So maybe that's what need to happen with us. That is why I wrote ""The Cabin"". A way to slam us back together and realign our energies. The fear and anxiety we have would dispell in just a few minutes of our closeness. In the end none of it matters except the love. A simple hello, how are you, I'm sorry and a embrace and a kiss. The magnitude of healing that would flow through us is beyond imagination. Though I believe in it with all my heart. So much in us is broken because we are not near to each other. If we could agree to put away the past just for a little while and let ourselves feel what's there underneath then you would be surprised at how effortlessly alot of the healing would be. There would still be things that had to be actively pursued to fill the void that pain has left us in. It can't be all easy or we loose respect for it. But see this work isn't like work to me. Not now. Now it's my favorite thing to do. I would call it a hobby but hobbies come and go. So I call it a calling. My calling. This is what my purpose is and what I am meant to do. If not to bring us together then to help calm the storm in you. You are entitled to your path and your pain. Your entitled to the time it takes to get there. Though you and I have both had time and we should be working together to get the rest of the way. So this is a reminder that we have suffered enough. That I am ready when you are. That you don't have to do this to yourself anymore. We can do this together. Starting off safe and slow. Cautious if need be or slamming us together and aligning our energies. Sweetness I will slam with you anytime, anyplace, and anywhere. Just like the shirt in your closet says. The one I bought for you to be you might shirt when you stayed over at my place when we first got together. I don't care who watches or who sees us anymore. If the demons are outside then let them watch. I will never be ashamed to slam with you till the stars burn out and the sun doesn't rise. I would still slam with you in the dark just as nice. 

If you think I am lying then why don't you try me? Your not scared are you? Your not chicken are you? Lol. How about  I play you in pool, or in darts. Even your favorite a game of chess. I know I'd loose but if I have to loose to someone then why not for it to be you? How about Strip Chess. That should make it interesting. We could make little rules and write them on little pieces of paper. Stuffing them inside the pieces. Each time you take someone's piece you read the paper and the other person has to do what it says. Wow that could be a new favorite game for me. I think youd have fun making a clown out of me. I think Id love to see you laugh at my antics. Your laugh was so amazing. Come on Sweetness you know you wanna. I know you fancy a game. Why not take the game to the next level. We could play once a week. Eventually I'd have to win sometime right? So tell me would your ego still force you to have to win. Using your womanly wiles to disrupt my attention, or would you just loose on purpose so that we could come together and slake our need of each other? If so and it came time to walk out the door till next week would you be able to let me, or would you slam me against the door to keep from walking away and pour your willing heart into my hands along with your body? I know you want to test it. I know you want to find out. I know you want to find out it if is as real in your head and is it in your heart. You want to know if it's still there after all this time and everything that has happened. So let the games begin my Sweetness. Let's test our wills and see what our hearts have to say about it. How about a game of the silent treatment. The first one to utter a single word or sigh or scream looses. Let's time it and see how long it takes. Let's laugh about into the future when we are old and grey. I will bet then your eyes will sparkle just as much as they did then. I bet the smokey desire they have always had when I am near will still be there when our bodies betray us. I bet we still find ways to enjoy each other even then. You don't think so? Then let's test it. Honey Nicolas Sparks hasn't got shot on us. Our real life is better than any book he ever thought about writing. At least it will be when we figure this mess out.

I want to go to school for automotive paint and body. It's something I was good and it makes dam good money. We had a deal that once you were done with school that I would get to go. I hope one day you will choose to help do that. 

I want to buy a piece of land. Just an acre would be fine. Something that is mine and in my name. Something that can't be taken away and I can't be forced to move away. 

I want to put one of those tiny home cabins on it. I've been looking and they are really extraordinary. You can get them fully furnished and the interior complete or you can get them bare bones. I don't know which I would do but I can figure that out later. If I had the ability I'd get it with the interior complete. 

I want something to be proud of. Something that is mine and won't leave me. Something I can put care and work into. Something that can grow with me as time goes by. 

I want you there by my side. I'd love for you to be there from the start. So that it is our home and our sanctity. Filled with our individual personalities. Our energies working together.

One thing all of this has taught me is that my pride can easily rob me of all that I cherish. So life took away my pride and my ego. So that I could find out what really is important.

I promise you the task is not to daunting and I will endeavor to please the gods just as I please your body and become the balm to your soul. I will calm your storm and I will bring you back there again and again to keep it away.

 When your demons come calling I want to show them what we have built together. I want to show them that this is our sacred space and they may be welcome to watch us from outside but no longer will they sup at our table while plotting our demise. They no longer will have access to you. I will stand guard at the gate of your heart. I will never relinquish the key. I didn't know then how to be the man you needed me to be.

So many things that were meant to hide your true feelings. All this has happened since and because of it I have learned to see. I will combat them with love. The love of my presence. The love of my attention. The love of my touch and the love of my desire and passion. You can't fight evil with evil. You only open the door and create more evil in the world. I will fight with love and honor. I will always sanctify the vows we took and both failed to take literally.

 There by the door I want your Alice in Wonderland book safe that contains the cords of Black, White, Silver,and Blue that bind us together handfasted for eternity. I want that to dispell any hex upon us or our home. Just like I want a ring upon your finger to do the same. I don't know if you still have it. If you don't I will replace it with one that is better bought from the sweat of my brow. I will work longer and harder and so make it more worthy to you so that you never remove it again. No I am not speaking unfairly to you. I know you loved that ring and my actions devalued it. Not it's cost. I accept that and if loosing it forever is the penalty then I will remake it in actions just as I unmade it. Did you not know that is it's purpose? It is a ward from evil. Not a symbol of possession.

I did this on night your were not home and woke with my hand numb and bloodless. A small price to pay. I poured all of myself into that ring. Everything I wanted us to be and all the love I had.  When you didn't take my name and you removed the ring all the protection was gone. All my belief in myself disappeared. I know that wasn't your intent. It's just how it happened. That ring haunts me every single day of my life. As if to shame me for the things I have done and the pain I have caused you. I've never loved jewelry. It was always something just nice to have. But dammed if I didn't love that ring. There was a part of me in it. I think you knew that and it's why you had to take it off. You couldn't shut down inside as long as you were wearing that ring. It was alive with my own essence and the magic soaked into it that we make when we are together. I don't blame you. I didn't uphold the the intentions that were placed in that ring. I failed myself and I failed you. I failed the ring. It's not a mistake I will ever make again. 

So now you know. The plan. I don't know if this competes with your own. I don't know if it would devalue the things you have built for yourself in my absence. It's not something that can't be redefined. I simply wanted you to know what I envision. There was a time when you strove to make things like this that were important to me happen. Although in this it is me that needs to do the majority of the work. It is me that has to make those steps to make it happen if it is to be a reality. Although I welcome your support and encouragement along the way. Just knowing you felt the same way or had a plan of your own would inspire me all the more. I want to build with you. Something that is ours and sacred. Our children are grown now and we have nothing to bring us together to work together for the sake of love. This could be that thing. Like we did to pull off the wedding. Like we did to get custody of my son. Like we did with your college degree.  When we actually work together great things always happened and when they didn't they never affected us much. 

I do this all the time Kelly. I live our life together in order to survive the reality that  we have become antithetical to each other. We are opposing magnets pushing each other away but not very far. Though if you slam two magnets together they will realign their poles. So maybe that's what need to happen with us. That is why I wrote ""The Cabin"". A way to slam us back together and realign our energies. The fear and anxiety we have would dispell in just a few minutes of our closeness. In the end none of it matters except the love. A simple hello, how are you, I'm sorry and a embrace and a kiss. The magnitude of healing that would flow through us is beyond imagination. Though I believe in it with all my heart. So much in us is broken because we are not near to each other. If we could agree to put away the past just for a little while and let ourselves feel what's there underneath then you would be surprised at how effortlessly alot of the healing would be. There would still be things that had to be actively pursued to fill the void that pain has left us in. It can't be all easy or we loose respect for it. But see this work isn't like work to me. Not now. Now it's my favorite thing to do. I would call it a hobby but hobbies come and go. So I call it a calling. My calling. This is what my purpose is and what I am meant to do. If not to bring us together then to help calm the storm in you. You are entitled to your path and your pain. Your entitled to the time it takes to get there. Though you and I have both had time and we should be working together to get the rest of the way. So this is a reminder that we have suffered enough. That I am ready when you are. That you don't have to do this to yourself anymore. We can do this together. Starting off safe and slow. Cautious if need be or slamming us together and aligning our energies. Sweetness I will slam with you anytime, anyplace, and anywhere. Just like the shirt in your closet says. The one I bought for you to be you might shirt when you stayed over at my place when we first got together. I don't care who watches or who sees us anymore. If the demons are outside then let them watch. I will never be ashamed to slam with you till the stars burn out and the sun doesn't rise. I would still slam with you in the dark just as nice. 

If you think I am lying then why don't you try me? Your not scared are you? Your not chicken are you? Lol. How about  I play you in pool, or in darts. Even your favorite a game of chess. I know I'd loose but if I have to loose to someone then why not for it to be you? How about Strip Chess. That should make it interesting. We could make little rules and write them on little pieces of paper. Stuffing them inside the pieces. Each time you take someone's piece you read the paper and the other person has to do what it says. Wow that could be a new favorite game for me. I think youd have fun making a clown out of me. I think Id love to see you laugh at my antics. Your laugh was so amazing. Come on Sweetness you know you wanna. I know you fancy a game. Why not take the game to the next level. We could play once a week. Eventually I'd have to win sometime right? So tell me would your ego still force you to have to win. Using your womanly wiles to disrupt my attention, or would you just loose on purpose so that we could come together and slake our need of each other? If so and it came time to walk out the door till next week would you be able to let me, or would you slam me against the door to keep from walking away and pour your willing heart into my hands along with your body? I know you want to test it. I know you want to find out. I know you want to find out it if is as real in your head and is it in your heart. You want to know if it's still there after all this time and everything that has happened. So let the games begin my Sweetness. Let's test our wills and see what our hearts have to say about it. How about a game of the silent treatment. The first one to utter a single word or sigh or scream looses. Let's time it and see how long it takes. Let's laugh about into the future when we are old and grey. I will bet then your eyes will sparkle just as much as they did then. I bet the smokey desire they have always had when I am near will still be there when our bodies betray us. I bet we still find ways to enjoy each other even then. You don't think so? Then let's test it. Honey Nicolas Sparks hasn't got shot on us. Our real life is better than any book he ever thought about writing. At least it will be when we figure this mess out.

It got me thinking... why do those small, unexpected compliments give us such an emotional boost? I think it ties into how we all naturally crave positive interaction and validation from otbers. It's almost like a quick reminder that we're seen and appreciated, even if it's by someone we've never met before. I guess psycuologists might attribute it to the release of feel-good hormoones like dopamine or endorphins when we feel valued or noticed‚Äîeven in such tiny interactions.

**Chronomancy: A Field Guide for Time-Explorers**

‚ÄúEvery tick is a secret. Ready to listen?‚Äù

**1. Why the Ordinary Looks Empty**

Most days we drift through the hours wearing logic-shaped blinders. We wake at 07:15, gulp coffee, swipe screens, and march along routes so familiar the scenery fades to wallpaper. Habits keep life efficient‚Ä¶ and keep whole universes out of sight.

Think of your attention as a nightclub bouncer: it lets known faces in and waves everyone else away. Only when something jolts the bouncer (an odd number plate, a strange smell, a sudden laugh) do we notice how crowded the room really is.

Chaos scientists call these habit-loops attractors. Picture a marble dropped into a soup-bowl: no matter where it starts, gravity pulls it to the dip in the middle. Our routines are bowls in time. Chance might jiggle the marble, but it still ends up in the dent, unless something flips the bowl.

**2. Flipping the Bowl: The Random Alarm**

Enter the Chronomancy app. Once a day, or twice, or ten times (your choice), it will ping at a second nobody, not even you, can predict. When the chime slices the moment like a bright coin on marble, you stop. You look. You listen.

That single act of noticing at an un-patterned instant cracks open reality‚Äôs shell. Suddenly you glimpse:

the bat napping under the bathroom eave you‚Äôve never examined,

the stranger‚Äôs sentence that seems harvested from your own diary,

the way afternoon sun dusts a concrete wall gold, then lilac, then indigo.

Each ping is the White Rabbit flicking his pocket watch and whispering: You‚Äôre late for a moment that exists only now.

**3. Beginner Spells**

When the alarm calls, become a Chronomancer:

**Scan the scene** ‚Äì Name three details you‚Äôd normally ignore: a purple leaf, the hum behind the light-bulb, graffiti half-scrubbed away.

**Hunt the odd** ‚Äì Anything mildly off-beat counts: twin strangers on the same bench, a song lyric echoing a thought you just had.

**Log it** ‚Äì Drop a note or photo in the community feed. Patterns love company.

**Time-pen-pal** ‚Äì Re-read your notes next week. Future-you will notice links today-you missed.

**Invent quests** ‚Äì Next alarm, focus only on sounds. Another day, only numbers. Curiosity is the fuel; the app supplies the spark.

**4. Sync-Events: When Many Marbles Jump Together**

Now and then the app picks the same random second for thousands of users. For a heartbeat the world becomes a gigantic mirror ball, every facet catching the same flash of light.

Why bother? Because randomness usually cancels itself out, like a million pendulums swinging out of sync. But give all those pendulums one identical shove and they lock into a brand-new rhythm. Shared surprise bends probability in fresh directions. What slips through might be subtle (a chorus of identical dreams, a wave of d√©j√†-vu tweets) or something wilder. Nobody knows; that‚Äôs the thrill.

If the math talk feels heavy, skip it and keep exploring. Mystery works whether you can recite the equations or not.

**5. Last Word from the Pocket-Watch Rabbit**

Your life is a tunnel built from hours and habits. Chronomancy drills peepholes in the walls. Peek through often enough and the tunnel dissolves into open sky.

So turn on the random alarm. Carry a notebook. Walk slow after each ping. The hidden seconds have been waiting a long time to meet you.

I‚Äôll never try and justify or make any excuses for seeking comfort in someone else, as I know I was wrong, I don‚Äôt need to be told that, seeing how much I hurt her was rough, the one person I truly care about just looked broken by me betraying her trust.. fast forward two years an we had stayed together, her trust seemingly a bit of a worry, but we where doing ok..¬†



Being stuck in her mums house was always the biggest issue for me, and there‚Äôs a lot of times I‚Äôve buried my head, not discussing things enough, not coping well with how I‚Äôm feeling.. when I‚Äôm stressed or anxious I believe I have a tendency to try and sleep my whole day away.. knowing it won‚Äôt help me not feel tired.. struggle for motivation etc , think issues with our sex life an not feeling like I was wanted, I just leaned on porn too much, which didn‚Äôt help on the off chance she was in the mood, whenever I asked what she‚Äôs into, I‚Äôd always be met with ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô, I could never understand how you can get to 33 an not know what you find attractive or what turns you on? It always just felt like it‚Äôs obvious it‚Äôs just me.. she‚Äôs bored of me etc..¬†



She said once when we had a date night she liked being watched, I wasn‚Äôt sure if she meant me watching her on her own, someone watching us have sex or what, I half jokingly asked if she meant like swinging? To which she was fairly adamant that‚Äôs not what she meant, that came up a few times again as a joke, but still always felt like whatever she was into wasn‚Äôt being put forward.. so to me in my head, it‚Äôs a kink that‚Äôs gonna be very.. out there, or it‚Äôs just me she‚Äôs not attracted to‚Ä¶



I can be snappy when I‚Äôm overwhelmed, but I‚Äôve never even raised my voice to her, I just struggle with stupid things at times and need to manage my emotions better (again not justified but if I can recognise where I‚Äôm letting people down, only then can I work on it)



So a few months ago she just randomly decided to go on a break, baring in mind in September we got engaged.. an by this point, I understand how I felt, given the mistakes I‚Äôve made both in this relationship and in life in general, I honestly believed I got to a point where I thought.. I don‚Äôt feel pressured to do these things cos it‚Äôs the right time etc, but I honestly want to spend the rest of my life with her..¬†



So we went to London to watch a gig for her birthday, stay the night an return the next day (our son was with her mum), but that wasn‚Äôt her real present, I‚Äôd booked a surprise trip to somewhere that meant a lot to us both (planned when we first met, but health, lockdown and then a baby put that to one side for a few years) I‚Äôd ordered me her an our sons passports in secret, bought all holiday clothes for me and my son, few bits for her, booked the flights, accommodation and transfers, and a tour where one of the stops was the spot I wanted to propose.. and the ring obviously that I‚Äôd had custom made to be more personal..¬†



I thought we‚Äôd been through a lot, I was seriously fed up at times, struggling with a lot, but the only thing I never ever questioned was how I felt about her.. she said yes, and that was the happiest I‚Äôve ever been in my life.. I finally had the family life id always wanted.



So her leaving me came out of nowhere.. after two weeks I moved out.. just for a bit of space, she asked for a break but no matter what I said or done she didn‚Äôt seem to wanna go on date nights, she didn‚Äôt wanna talk, try counselling etc..¬†



So after a couple of months she agreed counselling would be good, for me.. even if it never worked in the way I wanted, it‚Äôd be good to work on the communication we clearly lacked at times at least for the sake of our son.



But the fact she agreed to it I thought was massive progress, something I thought we‚Äôd needed for a while, cos I love her but don‚Äôt think you should ever stop working on both yourselves an your relationship.



Whilst being separated I continued to try an support her and encourage her to do things for herself, including going the gym, working at festivals and other hobbies she enjoys.



So while working shifts on my days off I have our son, an one day she was supposed to pick him up in the morning before I went back to work, she hadn‚Äôt responded to any of my messages about coming to get our son, so I rang at dinner time, when she answered i worried I was being paranoid but it sounded like she was telling someone to shush etc

And given that our son and our dog is with me.. my heart sank.. but later on we met up, we‚Äôd planned to have a family picnic, and whilst to her that might be just for the little one.. those moments where I get to spend time together as a family mean absolutely everything to me.



He‚Äôd fell asleep so we just got a brew an sat outside the coffee shop, we where talking for ages, the sex thing came up an there‚Äôs a couple of times where I‚Äôve been sat there thinking why have you never opened up like this an been honest about stuff when we where together, telling me more about what she liked etc , the fact she‚Äôd got lazy an comfortable (which I understand)¬†



So I plucked up the courage to ask about the above, I just said I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm being an arsehole.. but this morning it sounded like you where telling someone to shush.. you weren‚Äôt alone.. she immediately laughed an said absolutely not, I would not have someone in mine an my sons bed that‚Äôs not ok..¬†



So I left it alone, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling she picked her words very carefully, so I mentioned it again a few days later saying exactly that.. you didn‚Äôt say you hadn‚Äôt, you just seemed to pick your words really carefully.. she said you asked a question, I answered ..¬†



I thought that‚Äôs fair but still felt intentional..



So I just asked her straight.. I‚Äôve not been near anyone else, I‚Äôve not slept with anyone else since we met, even now.. I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ have you?¬†



A she just went quiet a said yeah.. went on to say it was one a done on a night out, didn‚Äôt mean anything.. said it was before this festival she worked after I said was it then, which means it took around two weeks for her to jump into someone else‚Äôs bed..¬†



An given how often she turned down sex, how worried I was I wasn‚Äôt good enough in and out of bed, she‚Äôd mentioned previously she looked into weather or not she was asexual (not sure if that‚Äôs the right term, but someone who‚Äôs not really into typical sex)¬†



So my thought then was ok so you don‚Äôt like sex.. or just not with me?¬†



I tried not to react, as we are split.. but it‚Äôs still incredibly shitty, I‚Äôm sat at home with her engagement ring round my neck refusing to give up, reading bed time stories to my son an crying myself to sleep an that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs doing..



I couldn‚Äôt get my head round someone who‚Äôd claimed wanted to be with me forever done that like 8 months into being engaged?



I mentioned on a couple of occasions.. I‚Äôm not mad I‚Äôm just gutted.. she later admitted she did know him.. someone who works in the same place but they only seen eachother on works nights out etc (I‚Äôm not sure I believe that) they aren‚Äôt still talking (don‚Äôt believe this either), and she said it was just a bit of fun, she didn‚Äôt regret it, I‚Äôve been cut up about something I done years ago, feeling like the worlds biggest piece of shit, understood how it made her feel, the impact it had on our family..an she didn‚Äôt regret what she‚Äôd done.. that seemed really heartless to me.. she said sorry if it hurts¬†



if we‚Äôre gonna do this (counselling) I believe it‚Äôs something I can look past but I‚Äôve got non negotiables if you like.. I‚Äôve got to believe that you‚Äôre actually going to try this, not just turn up.. that your not gonna sleep with anyone else, (she said she can‚Äôt promise at first which was insane an later said obviously not)¬†



So I kinda went with it, thinking I‚Äôve got to much in this to give up, the counselling will either work, or provide closure, few weeks/month pass an she ghosted me again after saying she was going for food with her mate, had a bit of a family emergency an tried to lean on her an her phone was off, from like 8pm till midday the following day, then she said she was away for her birthday with the girls, but she didn‚Äôt tell me she was going the night before, then didn‚Äôt really follow that up till Sunday, so because of that miscommunication if you wanna call it that, there‚Äôs 3 days I couldn‚Äôt see my son.. cos he was with his nan, an id been waiting for her to send her consent to the counsellor with the money from our joint account to confirm we‚Äôre doing the session in 2 days, I‚Äôd told myself if she doesn‚Äôt send it, then I‚Äôm done.. that was my last non negotiable..¬†



She messaged saying she‚Äôs not ready etc, and I just feel lost, I‚Äôm constantly going back and forth from.. if whatever we had truly meant anything, if she mean anything she said.. maybe she‚Äôs being defensive? Maybe she doesn‚Äôt want me to give up etc.. I have no desire to sleep with anyone, to date anyone, any of it..¬†



And then other days I wanna force myself to cos she probably is, she‚Äôs acting with 0 regard for how I feel, but that feels false to me because I genuinely have no interest in anyone else, I‚Äôm trying to keep it together, continue working hard and saving both to make sure my son is well provided for, or if by some miracle this works out.. we have money for a house‚Ä¶¬†



I‚Äôve not really spoken to her since she said that, even when dropping my son off it‚Äôs been as short as ‚Äòhis uniform is in the bag‚Äô give him a hug and kiss an leave.. even tho that kills me.. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to conduct myself, whatever I do feels wrong..¬†



(Just to add, when discussing our sex life, I‚Äôd asked if the open relationship thing she‚Äôs previously said she considered, would she want to sleep with other people, she said maybe‚Ä¶ so I honestly think that was for her not me.. cos I really don‚Äôt want that.. the thought of her with someone else kills me..)¬†



She has this way of being cold and distant in this whole situation which I just don‚Äôt understand.. whenever I said she doesn‚Äôt seem arsed, conflicted in any way she gets defensive saying how would I know?¬†



(Just basing that off her general behaviour, what she‚Äôs saying to me and her attitude) I miss her constantly an it‚Äôs been a hell of a long time since I felt like she missed me..¬†",1,1753598488.0,relationship_advice,0,0.67,False

1mafh9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1mafh9y/broke_student_living_alone_on_minimum_wage/,Broke student living alone on minimum wage,"Hello guys!

**BACKGROUND INFO:**

I've been lurking on this subreddit for months and I've seen some useful advice so i decided to write this post.

I am 26 and I am currently living with my ex-partner and my dog. I am currently flat hunting and i cannot seem to find a place that accepts pets in a safe area that is within budget.

I work full time as a support worker and i make 12.73 per hour. My annual salary per contract is 24500 but i work overtime and this year i made around 28500 (these figure are before tax). My monthly salary is not fixed - depending on the overtime i worked. If i happened to take annual leave and wasnt able to do overtime, i took home 1700 and if i had flexibility the specific month i could make up to 2600 take home. Lets say that on average i take home around 2k.

I am also a part time postgraduate student and i self fund my studies, which is my biggest ""issue"" right now. My course costs 15k over 2 years. Im so far halfway through so i have anther 7.5k to go :')

So far i was able to handle it as i was living with my partner and bills including rent were split in two and on the rare occasion i couldnt afford something, i would borrow money from him and pay him back later. But now that i have to live alone all my bills will rise and im not sure if ill be able to handle it.

Note: Because of the nature of my job i work long shifts (14 hours). Once a week i work 31 hours straight (14 hours + 10 hour night shift + 7 hour shift). And occasionally i would work 50-60 hours straight. During these hours, my ex-partner would take care of the dog. Now that i'll be alone, it wont be feasible for me to carry out these long shifts therefore - less opportunities to make more money.

**BILLS:**

I tried my best to calculate approximately how much my life would cost if i lived alone, and if my calculations are right, it goes like this:

Council Tax: 106  
Water: 30  
Gas/Electric: 80?! - depending on weather i guess  
Supermarket: 200 - I think this would be less tbh  
Dog: 55 - Pet insurance and food  
Uni Fees: 625  
Phone: 52  
Wifi: 30? - I guess i can get a student discount  
Transport: 70 - public transport plus an occasional uber

Thats a total of 1248

I am wondering what would be a doable rent. Right now im looking at places between 650-750 but I feel like its risky.

I also don't spent unreasonably - almost at all. I don't go shopping, i don't buy things for myself, don't have any subscriptions

**POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:**

1. Loan for the 7.5k remaining for uni. Not student loan as i want to start paying it back immediately - i hate knowing that i owe money. If i get a loan i'll probably be paying 200-300 a month which cuts down my uni expenses in half. gives me more wiggle room and some extra money in case of an emergency
2. Roommate. I considered a roommate and my bills including rent would be around 1700 so that leaves me with 300 extra. While it is a better financial decision, i am not sure how it would work out with me having a dog. And i've heard horror roommate stories in general. So i'm thinking of my mental health as well. I am completely alone here, going through a breakup alone, work an emotionally draining job - overtime, and then study, and i dont really want to go home to a negative environment after i finish work. I feel i need some part of my life to be...calm so i can unwind and gather my wits to keep going - this is probably a luxury i guess.
3. I thought of staying at the house were now but the rent is 850 - well over my budget. I am also looking at unfurnished places as they're more likely to accept pets and they're usually cheaper - even though i'll have to sleep on a mattress ;p

Any opinions/advice? :D

  
EDIT: I am also looking into getting a new job that will pay extra supplements for weekends, overtime, night shifts.

I am also thinking of maybe getting a second job -dont know if thats a smart move tax wise- but in an irrelevant field. A coffee shop or something. I currently have an hour travel to work (yes it sucks after working so many hours) so finding something irrelevant thats close to my place, and also not as mentally draining would possibly help.

##Unnecessary story and humble bragging:

This is my new baby who is having babies and I‚Äôm in way over my head, but apparently doing a decent job based on the impressive growth and her 3 children. 

I bought this lovely lady back in May when my sister and I went on a plant and coffee shop road trip through my state, that‚Äôs not important, I will reluctantly admit that I only bought her because she was labeled ‚Äúpickle plant‚Äù and I thought it looked cool. Turns out, she‚Äôs not even a true pickle plant (that was a fun wormhole) and also that ‚Äúup to 8‚Äù as a houseplant‚Äù does not apply to this one. She follows rules and expectations about as well as I do. She‚Äôs tall af and I swear she‚Äôs growing more each day (but no flowers ‚òπÔ∏è) and she has sprouted 3 little infants in the past month. Now, I‚Äôve been known to struggle keeping plants, even succulents, alive due to somehow simultaneously over and under watering. I like this one, and she apparently likes me, too‚Ä¶ this is the longest I‚Äôve had a plant and I‚Äôm pretty proud of myself. 

I keep doing research and looking things up and these are honestly such cool plants, I‚Äôm really happy I ended up with her. She‚Äôs pretty dope. When I got her, she was living in one of the coffee shops and wasn‚Äôt very impressive, just kinda cool, and I wanted to give it a go. I brought her home and watched her for a couple weeks and started getting a feeling that I needed to repot her. I went to a nursery to get a slightly bigger pot, at least deeper, and the lady told me not to do it unless the current one was swelling or her roots were showing, but something kept telling me to still get what I needed and to double check. So I did. And boy am I glad, I took her out of the original pot and her roots were crowded and barely fit in it. I think she‚Äôs happier now and she almost immediately started growing and then started sprouting. 

##Now to the point:

I don‚Äôt live in the ideal environment for her, which makes it even more impressive that she‚Äôs exceeding Google‚Äôs expectations‚Ä¶ she doesn‚Äôt get *that* trait from me. I noticed she was growing at an angle when she was under the window so I did some digging and found out that it meant the window wasn‚Äôt giving her quite enough sun and that I should get her a grow light, so like a good plant mother way in over her head, I did just that. She likes the grow light, she sprouted the newest child after I set it up and she‚Äôs growing even faster, but this one little finger is literally growing away from the light and idk what to do. If it‚Äôs not a problem then I don‚Äôt mind, but I‚Äôm worried about it becoming too heavy or unbalanced and creating an issue. So, should I leave well enough alone or is there something I need to do to help this one little finger out?

##unrelated to my issue, 
is there a name for the fingers or do I just keep referring to them as such?

# [1.1 A preface to the preface]()

Life looked a bit different in 2009. As a young pediatrician, I felt like the king of the world. I was about to start my second residency in infectious diseases and thought I was invincible.

Then came that phone call. It wasn't even meant for me.

The call was between Prof. P.Y. and Prof. D.G. At its core was P.Y.'s need to find a replacement lecturer for the parasitology course for second-year medical students, due to Prof. Y.A.'s imminent retirement. P.Y., who was then the head of the medical school, saw he was in trouble and immediately called the least suitable person for the task. He knew very well that D.G. was lazy and knew nothing about parasites, but he also knew very well that he could impose anything he wanted on D.G., and D.G. had no means of resistance.

I was casually passing through the corridor next to D.G.'s room, where I constantly hung out. A silly smile on my lips and a deep need to read another 500 unnecessary pages in Feigin or Mandell (the textbooks for infectious diseases in children and adults, respectively). I had no idea how my life was about to change completely.

I could hear snippets of the conversation. It was clear D.G. was in distress, and the hundred-kilo hammer on his head was causing him slight discomfort. Then the unbelievable happened. Deus ex machina. D.G. spotted my clumsy figure dancing in the hallway and immediately jumped up ‚Äì ""Shalom, you have a phone call."" The idiot that is me immediately replied, ""No problem,"" took the receiver, and brought it to my ear. ""Yes, P.Y., what's up?"" The end.

I won't bore you with the details. P.Y. commanded me, in the most polite and friendly tone he could muster, to attend a meeting with Y.A. in the parasitology lab to replace him in delivering the course in question.

A week later, I was walking happily and light-heartedly, with septol in my eye (don't ask) that made me grimace and look like a pervert, on my way to the pathology building. On the second floor, in the parasitology lab, Prof. Y.A. was waiting for me.

It's worth understanding a few basic things about the situation at that time:

* I have just finished my pediatrics residency. My knowledge of parasitology was close to zero and included memories of missing a class or two due to military reserve duty and my father's memorial service. That's it.
* Parasites sounded to me like something related to bizarre jungle diseases. Something with swollen testicles and terrifying pictures of worms peeking out of all sorts of holes and orifices in the body. (Yes, I know I was stupid, and I hope it's mostly passed).
* Prof. Y.A. didn't know me at all, certainly didn't remember me from my student days (a grade of 85 in the course, thanks for asking).
* My professional aspirations were limited to completing my infectious diseases residency; I was happy to be the youngest and most enthusiastic in the group.
* I had no teaching experience at all and only a vague idea in my head of what I wanted to say in the conversation.

I entered the room. Y.A. offered me coffee. I refused. He tried to understand why I was twitching as if suffering from St. Vitus' Dance. I didn't have the energy or desire to explain to him that I had gotten septol (alcohol-based hand sanitizer) in my eye a few minutes ago in the ward, while washing my hands for the thousandth time that morning, as usual.

He got straight to the point and immediately surprised me. Yes, of course, he needed me to teach the course. But that wasn't the main thing. Before his retirement, the sleepy Iraqi realized he hadn't secured a successor for managing the parasitology lab. In fact, he had found a successor, Dr. D., but had a fight with him a few weeks before the end. Now he dropped the bombshell and asked me to take over the lab management. I chuckled, contorted, grimaced, didn't understand. What did that have to do with me, for God's sake?!

I had never considered a career in a lab. After all, I was a clinician burdened with shifts and sleepless nights filled with resuscitations and hallucinations. What did I have to do with this?!

I explained that it wouldn't happen, but gladly (a blatant lie, but I tried to minimize damage and retreat quickly) I would teach the course starting next year. The conversation quickly died down; one could see the light fade from Y.A.'s face and his enthusiasm vanish. We quickly agreed on a course outline, he handed me some files, and we parted ways.

Since then, I have been teaching the parasitology course every year with great enthusiasm, both mine and the students. This book summarizes the course as it is ‚Äì a rollercoaster ride of dubious science (all my knowledge comes from self-study), eternal stand-up shows (I have a need to make people laugh in lectures, otherwise I get bored), and countless experiences with parasites. I learned to love the profession, the patients, and yes, even the parasites. They are my closest friends. I try to know everything about them, to laugh at them, to understand them, and to successfully kill them. All out of mutual respect for these repulsive creatures.

I'm sure you'll find interest in the crazy journey you're about to embark on. Parasitology is fascinating. The most fascinating of all. Believe me.

And as for Y.A.'s offer to manage the lab? In retrospect, the best offer I ever received. I regret not taking it in real-time.

Amiko is your bilingual best friend‚Äîan AI language exchange partner. I‚Äôve studied Korean for 6 years & worked in startups for 4, and I‚Äôm finally building the app I wish I had.

If you enjoy learning languages, you‚Äôll love this\~

# Product

Amiko is a mobile app for conversational language practice with AI characters. Each user gets their own Amiko from a certain language/culture. Their Amiko lives a local life in the country, loves texting & calling with you, & wants to help you become fluent ü´∂

# Design Vision

One big way Amiko will motivate people to learn languages is by romanticizing the culture üåÜ. So it‚Äôs important the art style expresses its beauty and richness. Cozy, wholesome, sweet, beautiful, warm, pleasant. And it should be iconic & recognizable‚Äîpeople see it and go ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs Amiko!‚Äù

There are 3 major components:

**1. Onboarding üëã**

* Amiko will have a beautiful, cinematic onboarding (think Stardew Valley, Pokemon). You‚Äôre studying a language, but you‚Äôre exhausted. Suddenly, you get an email to apply to Amiko, a new language exchange program. You apply... then get matched with your Amiko the next morning!

**2. Characters üë©**

* Each character will have a different ethnicity & gender, suited for whatever language they‚Äôre learning (Korean guy, American girl, Russian guy)
* The characters should not feel too realistic or lifelike. They should feel more‚Ä¶ artistic. Less detail is better.
* Each Amiko has 1 still image + multiple animated states (talking vs idle)

**3. Backdrops üñºÔ∏è**

* Backdrop art of where the character is right now. (Inside their bedroom, outside of coffee shop, at the park). Animated (flying birds, twinkling water, swaying trees)

  
For the art style: I've been thinking... pixel, painted/pastel, geometric, vector-ish, but open to other art styles too! (I like Tolan, Tiny Bookshop, Lofi Girl)

You can see the full design vision here.

# Gig Details

* I‚Äôm looking for a designer to help with all 3 components‚ÄîOnboarding, Characters, & Backdrops. You don‚Äôt need to to do all 3, but it would be great if you could, since the art style should be consistent.
* We can start with a small contract for a few characters/backdrops. If it‚Äôs a good fit, this could turn into larger contracts
* Looking to start ASAP
* Flexible budget‚Äîup to $100s/$1000s throughout the duration of the project, USD, prefer PayPal

# Please DM me

* Your portfolio, pointing out relevant work (onboarding, characters, backdrops)
* Any thoughts or ideas you have around Amiko's design
* Which components you‚Äôd be able to work on
* Your rate

I live a really busy life. I feel like all I do is go. Today, I spent the day cleaning the house. Normally on the weekends, I have been taking care of the plants right when I get up and not stopping until I have something completed. Example: all the Sunflowers planted. I started so many seedlings this year it was overwhelming trying to make sure they flourished. My neighbor's house is all plants I gave to her. She has about three pots on her porch full of plants and a hanging basket I made for her. Every year I buy her a plant. This year I just had so many plants that I needed to ensure they survived. I like plants a lot. 

A few years ago she ended up getting sick and couldn't walk after a vaccination. I can tell she is social and lonely. I am not much of a social person in my private life. I've lived in my neighborhood for a while now and I've always tried my best to just keep to myself. She will yell from across the street to me, so I engage back. They seem nice. I would come home from buying plants and I would see her outside smoking and I was always unloading my massive plant collection for the year. I decided she needed some love or something to brighten up her days. She started smoking after her son passed away. So, we have these awkward moments where we see each other. Sometimes she yells out and other times she is quiet. 

She yelled out yesterday on my lunch break because the deer have been eating her flowers. I came over and looked at them. I told her that it will be okay because they will keep coming back after they're cut. She told me she likes watching the baby bumble bees that come on them. I sometimes feel guilty because she can't work anymore and I do not like having more than others. That is part of the reason I give her stuff as well. The flowers give her something pretty on her porch and she likes the bees. I got her strawberry plants this year as well. She is moving more and I know she gets bored and lonely, so sharing my plants gives her something to do and look forward to. She got excited when I brought them to them and told me her plans to plant them. I brought her over several plants I started to grow from seeds. I told myself I didn't need them and I knew she could use them. 

Wherever she gets me over she wants to chat and will give me things she made. Like jam, cake, and iced coffee. I couldn't imagine how she feels being unable to do the things she used to. She can be blunt and I find it funny. I think she and I have a good relationship for being neighbors. Anyways back at the life stuff. I got off track.

Today was my daughter's birthday party. It was small with family. She got a car this year before her actual birthday. So I got her something small for the get-together. Today wasn't her birthday but it was when we were able to all get together for it. Some things have changed for my mom and my days got a little easier. I was able to get my mom into a hospital. Not before she did what she normally does. She fought with the house staff and four cops. A doctor was able to get her into inpatient care. That was difficult to get accomplished, but I was able to get her on the meds I wanted her on. She seems slightly better. She had many more facial movements and emotional expressions. She is chatty. She was let out of the hospital right before the 4th of July. I was able to take her to our fireworks show we do. She did pretty well. 

I had her over for a sleepover last weekend. We went out for dinner and lunch. Picked out new hanging baskets. They were so big when she held them up. She explored the house a lot and helped me plant flowers. She did have a poop episode and it was pretty shitty but I helped her out and we got the mess under control. She seems much more with it though. I did find out what was wrong with her and she has to have surgery for her gallbladder removal. I was told she had incontinence, but I had her go to an appointment to find out she doesn't. I was pretty sure it was the medications she was on for schizophrenia. I think after she changed meds it resolved it. She used to be on 1st generation medications and she was on 2nd generation drugs. The 2nd generation drugs cause incontinence. I think after I got her into a a hospital and a doctor listened to me it resolved that issue. We did see her physiatrist and he doesn't want to make any changes to her meds because she seems much more stable with the medication changes. I am happy she is seeming better and I was able to finally get someone who would listen. I am grateful. 

It was a Muslim doctor who had helped me. I have noticed that Muslim people are very compassionate and caring to others. My mom has a caregiver who is Muslim as well and she cares a lot about my mom. I couldn't have asked for someone better to care for my mom. She told me she wants my mom to be healthy and she looks at her as her friend. She is incredible and treats her as a person. The people who have helped me the most with my mother have been Muslim. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to get to know them and their culture. They're compassionate people and so kind. Her caregiver is sweet to my mom. I will have to do something nice for her to say thank you for all she does. 

I should get some sleep.

I have been making these bagels since 2017 and I feel they are perfection. Especially when you crave that breakfast sandwich we are used to grabbing at the fast food drive throughs with a coffee on the way to work.

So I have been making a batch on Sunday and prepping them for the week to grab as I get that craving. Super easy to make and you can eat them any time of day.

You can even make a tuna, chicken or egg salad sandwiches, toast them and smear on a little cream cheese and sugar free jam, or do some meal prep like I have been and make some egg sausage and cheese bagel sandwiches!

# Keto Bagels 

**Servings:** 6

**Prep Time:** 10 Minutes 

**Cook Time:** 15 Minutes

# Ingredients:

* 1 1/2 cup almond flour
* 1 tbsp baking powder
* 2 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, *shredded*
* 2 oz cream cheese
* 2 large eggs, *beaten*

**Optional Toppings**

* Sesame seeds for topping 
* Cinnamon and sugar or substitute mix
* Everything seasoning for topping
* Poppy seeds
* Coarse sea salt and cracked black pepper

# Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Whisk together the almond flour and baking powder, removing clumps. Set aside.

Combine shredded mozzarella and cubed cream cheese in a large bowl. Microwave for 1 minute 30 seconds, stir and mix until incorporated.

Stir the flour mixture and eggs into the melted cheese mixture. 

Working quickly while the cheese is still hot, knead with your hands until a dough forms. The dough is very sticky, but keep kneading and squeezing through your fingers for a few minutes. (If the dough becomes hard before fully mixed, and is difficult to mix, or is still sticky after a couple minutes, you can microwave to reheat for 15-20 seconds to soften it. In that case, wash your hands and knead again. Dough needs to be well formed before starting the rolling for bagel shapes. *To make this step easier to mix the dough, you can use mixer with a dough attachment instead of kneading by hand.* 

**Knead... Knead... Knead!** It's the secret to puffy, chewy bagels! 

Divide the dough into 6 parts. 

Form/roll a 6‚Ä≥ log shape between hands with each part, then press the ends together to make a bagel shape, place on the lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough.

Sprinkle with desired toppings. If using sesame seeds, sprinkle them over the bagels and gently press into the dough.

Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the bagels are firm and golden.

If you decide to make them, let me know what you think!

I won't bore you with the details. P.Y. commanded me, in the most polite and friendly tone he could muster, to attend a meeting with Y.A. in the parasitology lab to replace him in delivering the course in question.

A week later, I was walking happily and light-heartedly, with septol in my eye (don't ask) that made me grimace and look like a pervert, on my way to the pathology building. On the second floor, in the parasitology lab, Prof. Y.A. was waiting for me.

It's worth understanding a few basic things about the situation at that time:

* I have just finished my pediatrics residency. My knowledge of parasitology was close to zero and included memories of missing a class or two due to military reserve duty and my father's memorial service. That's it.
* Parasites sounded to me like something related to bizarre jungle diseases. Something with swollen testicles and terrifying pictures of worms peeking out of all sorts of holes and orifices in the body. (Yes, I know I was stupid, and I hope it's mostly passed).
* Prof. Y.A. didn't know me at all, certainly didn't remember me from my student days (a grade of 85 in the course, thanks for asking).
* My professional aspirations were limited to completing my infectious diseases residency; I was happy to be the youngest and most enthusiastic in the group.
* I had no teaching experience at all and only a vague idea in my head of what I wanted to say in the conversation.

I entered the room. Y.A. offered me coffee. I refused. He tried to understand why I was twitching as if suffering from St. Vitus' Dance. I didn't have the energy or desire to explain to him that I had gotten septol (alcohol-based hand sanitizer) in my eye a few minutes ago in the ward, while washing my hands for the thousandth time that morning, as usual.

He got straight to the point and immediately surprised me. Yes, of course, he needed me to teach the course. But that wasn't the main thing. Before his retirement, the sleepy Iraqi realized he hadn't secured a successor for managing the parasitology lab. In fact, he had found a successor, Dr. D., but had a fight with him a few weeks before the end. Now he dropped the bombshell and asked me to take over the lab management. I chuckled, contorted, grimaced, didn't understand. What did that have to do with me, for God's sake?!

I had never considered a career in a lab. After all, I was a clinician burdened with shifts and sleepless nights filled with resuscitations and hallucinations. What did I have to do with this?!

I explained that it wouldn't happen, but gladly (a blatant lie, but I tried to minimize damage and retreat quickly) I would teach the course starting next year. The conversation quickly died down; one could see the light fade from Y.A.'s face and his enthusiasm vanish. We quickly agreed on a course outline, he handed me some files, and we parted ways.

Since then, I have been teaching the parasitology course every year with great enthusiasm, both mine and the students. This book summarizes the course as it is ‚Äì a rollercoaster ride of dubious science (all my knowledge comes from self-study), eternal stand-up shows (I have a need to make people laugh in lectures, otherwise I get bored), and countless experiences with parasites. I learned to love the profession, the patients, and yes, even the parasites. They are my closest friends. I try to know everything about them, to laugh at them, to understand them, and to successfully kill them. All out of mutual respect for these repulsive creatures.

I'm sure you'll find interest in the crazy journey you're about to embark on. Parasitology is fascinating. The most fascinating of all. Believe me.

And as for Y.A.'s offer to manage the lab? In retrospect, the best offer I ever received. I regret not taking it in real-time.
