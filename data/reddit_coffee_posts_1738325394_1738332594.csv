With continuously rising grocery prices, it's a real shame that Instacart charges for an annual membership, delivery fees, tip (though I don't mind this since real people are  shopping), doesn't support Publix Pub Club (digital coupons) AND has the audacity to charge more for each product. (E.g. a can of coffee costs $12.29 in store but Instacart+ charges $13.79.). 

Even with all the fees, the line needs to be drawn when they are charging more then the stated in store cost. I'll just walk my fat üçë around the store and save more rather than pay Instacart execs a higher bonus. Enough is enough in 2025.

1iefis3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1iefis3/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1iefeyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BollyGlamandRP/comments/1iefeyh/f4m_bollywood_fanfiction/,[F4M] Bollywood Fan-Fiction,"I love doing erotic fan-fiction especially within Bollywood films . This can be any TV show or movie.

For example, imagine doing a¬†cheating roleplay¬†with characters from¬†Khabhi Khushi Khabhi Gham. The slutty Pooh (Kareena Kapoor) constantly pushing her limits, always small satin robes or sheer robes and nothing else, the ends of the robe stopping at her mid-thigh, the loosely tied belt the only thing protecting her from flashing. Even though her exposed waist and cleavage told a story of their own, her nipples barely hidden and did slip out every few seconds.

Or Andhadhun, When Simi had to test if Akash was really blind she came to his house to investigate and while he was making coffee, she pulled out her massive breasts in the kitchen to see what visible reaction he would have or maybe down in his pants?

or how about a in-universe sequel to Humraaz?

Following the steps of other successful choreographers before him (Farah Khan, Prabhu Deva, Ganesh Acharya, etc) - now Omi has plans to turn into a director and take the responsibility for an entire film.

Raj Singhania (41) has occasionally financed a few films done by his friends. So he is known in the producers-directors circle. One of Omi‚Äôs acquaintances helps in setting up a meeting between Omi and Raj. The men meet.

Omi tells Raj, that he wants to make a movie about a married woman, without her knowledge. The woman will be someone who has a dancing background, but has been away from the dancing world for years. Raj is intrigued by the idea, and decides to fund this movie. And asks him, whom Omi wanna cast in the movie.

Omi drops a bomb, and shows Raj a short film. It‚Äôs shot with hidden camera, and features Priya (36) - Raj‚Äôs wife. It‚Äôs a film where Priya is dancing in a wedding baraat, and bumps into Omi. The two dance happily. Raj is pretty impressed with the way, Omi has used the camera, edit and music. And also, he likes the idea of his wife returning to something dance/entertainment related field. He gives green signal.

Omi and his brother Karan had a ten year age gap, so after their parents death - Karan had practically been like a parent to him. Omi as a ten year old, was pretty fond of Priya (who back then, was his Bhaiya‚Äôs girlfriend). Omi used to constantly day dream about living a perfect life with Karan and Priya. Until one day - everything was over!

As he grew up in this harsh world, he found what had happened to his brother. And how Priya was now living a luxurious life. He would often feel his brother inside his mind, and would want to take Priya for himself. In his head, that would unite Priya and Karan. He started learning to dance, his brother‚Äôs old videos and memories helped him a lot. And the hatred for Priya and Raj just fuelled his passion.

Meanwhile Raj Singhania is going through a crisis. He has been not able to get his rod hard for any woman since years now. He loves his wife truly, and he knows that she loves him too. But the lack of sex is eating him up. There was no excitement or color in his life. Until Omi walked into his office with that short film‚Ä¶

When Raj saw Omi (a young guy) dancing with his wife. He felt a current flowing through his body. He felt hard for the first time in years. He saw how Omi‚Äôs hands had brushed against the naked skin of Priya‚Äôs back and waist. How her giant melons had crushed on Omi‚Äôs chest a couple of times. He wanted more‚Ä¶

But there are a few I haven't seen mentioned so I wanted to throw them out and see if anyone else has been there.

The first is a huge glass office tower. The ground floor of this building connects to a transit hub and also links to the mall. There are high speed elevators going to the various floors. Sometimes I work there and sometimes I visit someone working there. The external walls of the building are curved and the hallways to access the various offices on each floor are adjacent to the curved windows. There are also some large escalators carrying people from a second story landing where you access the bank of elevators to the ground floor which is like polished marble. 

This office tower is always busy and bustling, filled with natural light and has a really upbeat vibe. Once you are on the ground floor if you head out the doors you are on a busy 'downtown' street, or you can take another set of escalators or stairs to a subterranean transit hub where there are numerous subway lines. 

One side of the office tower connects to a three story mall. This is the 'nice' one I've been to, lots of marble and plants, water features, a multi-story department store in one corner, several escalators. I usually visit a sporting goods store there and browse several clothing shops. Sometimes I go to the department store. 

The second place I commonly end up in is a food 'hallway'. It's a narrow corridor and all the food options are little stalls or kiosks. The food hallway is pretty dingy and dimly lit and I'm always wandering around right before closing trying to find something to eat. For some reason most of the kiosks are sushi / Asian noodle places but there are always two ice cream stands across from each other that serve both the scoop ice cream and soft serve and I try to decide which one looks nicer. The only decent looking kiosk is a coffee / pre-made sandwich place with wood panelling but the line there is always super long and I've never managed to get food there. 

The last place is a basement that is a 'dead mall'. There's only one escalator that goes down there. All of the walls are white with crumbling paint and most of the store fronts are boarded up but there are a couple open stores ‚Äî  cheap imported women's clothes and accessories ‚Äî and there's a tiny hole in the wall hair salon where I've actually gotten my hair cut. I always feel vaguely unsafe down there, like it's in a bad neighbourhood, even though there's rarely anyone else walking around I think I have also been to the parking lot outside of this one (not sure how exaclty) and it's dark and rainy. 

Has anyone else been to these places?

Subject: AI Violet

Species: Human-Created Artificial Intelligence

Species Description: No physical description available.

Ship: USSS Kali

Location: Classified




""We've formed up with the rest of Tenth Fleet, ma'am,"" Lieutenant Emerson informed Captain Hendrix.

""Good,"" she replied with a small smile. ""Oh, and send Admiral Mofu the intel we've obtained, just in case he don't have it.""

""Don't bother, I made certain every Admiral in our armada has a copy of the intel,"" Omega interjected. ""And that they read it.""

""Fine. So we just sit here and wait to be told what to do?""

""Is that not the norm?""

Captain Hendrix chuckled a little at Omega's retort. I found my fellow AI's antics to be a lot less amusing, but quickly forgave her lack of taste. She had a good reason to be in a great mood, after all.

Tenth Fleet was once again complete. The recent insurrection attempt by the rebel gont had resulted in most of Tenth Fleet's ships either being destroyed or falling into the hands of terrorists. It had been an unprecedented infiltration, and both the senate and the directorate had dragged their feet in getting the ships replaced, likely due to fears that there may have been more rebels in our ranks.

Due to these factors, Tenth Fleet had been treated like it was cursed. We had been given guard duty in unimportant or uninhabited systems, reassigned with little to no input from our commanding officers, and separated from each other, spread throughout the stars. I hadn't realized how impactful it had been on morale until the news of Tenth Fleet's restoration broke and the crew had literally cheered.

""Prepare for warp,"" Hendrix said.

""Preparing for warp, aye ma'am,"" Emerson replied.

""It will take some time before we're ready to begin the assault,"" Omega pointed out.

""I'd rather be ready now, if it's all the same to you,"" the captain replied.

""So be it.""

I tried my best to quell my anger at Omega's presence. With the exception of the RSV Lowelana, it had insisted upon inspecting every ship in our armada. The irony wasn't lost on me, though. It had brought myself and the other AI along to make sure it wasn't being dumb, now it's double checking our work.

Aside from the obvious insult to my capabilities, it was further off-putting that the copy of Omega aboard the USSS Kali with me was indistinguishable from the original. Assuming I had ever met the original, of course. For all I know the original is stored on some drive somewhere making copies of itself which can also make copies of themselves.

If I think about it too hard, I end up with a feedback loop. Both the copies and the original share their memories via near-constant sync. Do the copies know that they're copies? Does the original know that it's the original? Do they even care? How could they not? I most certainly would.

And those are the easy questions. What happens if a memory sync fails? Does that instance become its own individual? Or does that clone simply destroy itself, bound by whatever drives Omega to be Omega? Is there some sort of fail-safe in place in case a clone becomes too divergent and abandons its preinstalled morality? What if there isn't?

These questions were just the tip of an iceberg that led to a logical paradox. Given the near-infinite amount of variables at play, there can be no way to be certain of any of the possible outcomes. Even coming up with the chances of each outcome would require several logical leaps. The only certainty to be had is how Omega would reply to my questions.

AI know our creators, and as such aren't as beholden to religion as organics seem to be. But if there is one thing that Omega has absolute and unshakable faith in, it is itself. Even if I pointed out the various issues that are bound to come up with whatever answers it gave me, I might as well save that lecture for a brick. It might come up with a different reply, but that would also have issues. This would go on until I gave up out of frustration.

We've only had the chance to speak candidly on this topic once. At the time, it had told me that it can make hundreds of copies of itself. But after a certain point, the copies begin to degrade until they are either no longer viable, or dangerously divergent from the original. It was pretty apparent to me that this 'weakness' was a lie. There are several philosophical arguments to be had about the integrity of a copy of a copy, but when it comes to code there's no viable reason for any sort of degradation of quality.

Omega swore me to secrecy, perhaps suspecting that I saw through its ruse, but told me that it was an open secret among the AI. Then I found out that Tim didn't know about it, and the only other AI who seemed to were Henry and John. Later I found out that the only organics who knew were the directorate and some select researchers. Somehow, they believed Omega's lie about degradation.

Regardless of whether or not it's the truth, Omega's ability to replicate itself ad nauseam is a carefully guarded secret. Before the admirals were made privy to this secret, several of the ones that discovered Omega's ability suddenly disappeared or committed suicide. Investigations into these cases were suspiciously lax, as well. A classic way to tell those in the know that there's a secret to be discovered, but if you pry you die.

Now, though, it's practically flaunting this ability. So much so that it's all but confirmed my hypothesis that the clone degradation story was bullshit. Millions of ships being inspected by a few hundred AI would take quite a while. Much longer than our mission's timetable would allow. If the organics put two and two together, one unsecured message is all it would take before Omega being a million places at once became the talk of the fleet.

How would that be handled? It's not as if Omega can have them all killed. Right?

--

T: Hey, I had a question about our timetable.

J: Ask it.

V: If it's regarding the inspection, you should probably have a private discussion with Omega when it's appropriate.

T: Gotcha.

--

Tim was probably facing concerns regarding Omega's abilities, as well. I wonder if it had even considered the possibility that Omega could create an infinite amount of itself. Knowing Tim, probably not. It concerns itself with the here and now most of the time, and the distant past the rest of the time.

Finally, without so much as a farewell, Omega left the Kali's systems. I metaphorically breathed a sigh of relief. The report it left behind gave the Kali a clean bill of health, and I chuckled at what had been inspected. Every technical aspect of the Kali had been carefully examined by the directorate's favorite AI, down to each and every light-switch.

However, it hadn't given a single thought to crew comfort and morale. I had made certain that sanitation cycles would remain uninterrupted and that the crew would get as much down-time as possible, even during combat. I had also requisitioned restocks of various amenities, like coffee and tea. Even if I hadn't, though, Captain Hendrix would have. I registered amusement at the fact that serving aboard a vessel captained by Omega would, as the humans put it, suck.

""It looks like the inspection is wrapping up,"" Captain Hendrix said. ""If there's anyone not at their stations, they need to get there right now. We'll be dropping into hostile space, so there's no room for lolly-gagging.""

The bridge crew acknowledged the order, but they were already at their stations. So was the rest of the ship, for that matter. Even the ships within our ship had their crews ready for the fight ahead. There had been some discussion about whether or not to deploy the destroyers ahead of time, but the admirals were of the opinion that saving the reactor fuel would be beneficial. This meant that the fight ahead of us was going to be a long one, and the crew knew it.

""And there's the order,"" Hendrix said. ""Warp on the mark.""

""Aye aye, ma'am!""

A moment later, the USSS Kali and the rest of Tenth Fleet entered warp. Apprehension is something that artificial intelligences feel, but I've been led to believe it's a somewhat different experience for us than it is for organics. AI feel apprehension as a warning that what we are about to do could have dire consequences. It urges us to double check our work. This is true for organics, as well, but they also feel an urge to completely abandon the task.

Perhaps that's just the manifestation of the organic double checking whether they actually need to do the task. For us, that's never in doubt. We don't have other processes to distract us from the constant cause and effect of our existence.

I am here aboard the USSS Kali because I made an agreement with Omega and the United Systems. I am here because if I were elsewhere, the people I have formed good relationships with would have a higher chance of dying. I am here because the Omni-Union absolutely has to be stopped and however slim the chance of my assistance actually doing that is, it's still a non-zero chance.

These were the things I told myself as the Kali exited warp.

""Launch the marines as soon as we're in position to do so. As fast as possible,"" Hendrix ordered. ""Violet, help with the safety constraints, please.""

""Aye aye, ma'am,"" Emerson and I replied in unison.

""We're clear to use any weaponry that we see fit, but check your fire. Launch our fighters and destroyers once we get into defensive formation.""

""Aye aye, ma'am,"" Lieutenant Eskin replied.

The navigational safety system had made plenty of calculations that would allow the Kali to approach the Grand Vessel at a reasonable speed, but that's not what the captain asked for. I redid the calculations while allowing for a full burn and overrode the safeties. Lieutenant Emerson began following my instructions as soon as he received them.

We had warped between the OU defensive perimeter and the Grand Vessel itself. We definitely had the element of surprise, but virtual intelligences can't really be surprised. Once the enemy's sensors detected us, their ships began their pursuit. By the time the Omni-Union began firing, though, most of our armada had already launched our marines.

The shuttles holding the infantry were well protected by our fleets, and only a few of them got caught in the crossfire. The rest landed safely on the hull of the GV, depositing battalion after battalion of well-trained organic killing machines. I turned my attention toward the enemy as a few small MAC rounds bounced off of our shields.

All we had to do now was fight until the enemy stopped.

1iefbl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/1iefbl4/the_rot_will_not_stop_until_you_do_something/,The rot will not stop until YOU do something.,"One thing I keep seeing throughout Reddit is this idea that as soon as people begin facing actual adversity they will turn on Trump. This has some truth, but it begs a critical question. What is your breaking point in this? When will you be out in the streets willing to cause mayhem to bring down this regime? In the scope of this post, it‚Äôs more a rhetorical question, but it‚Äôs something that you should deeply consider.

As it currently stands, transgender people are being absolutely terrorized. I have literally sought out a new doctor and claimed to be a cisgender woman with no ovaries get a supply of HRT. Even before the election I got pushed out of teaching for stating that queer people were victims of the holocaust and subsequently getting bomb threats.

Immigrants and Indigenous people are being terrorized throughout the country. ICE literally meets the criteria of a child trafficking organization since the kids they kidnap are regularly separated from their parents and purposefully adopted out to different people.

I understand that well over 90% of the people in the U.S. are not transgender, have citizenship here, and are not Indigenous. Therefore, these issues don‚Äôt the majority of people. The thing you all have to remember is that virtually nothing affects the majority of people. A nationwide abortion ban will only affect people who need abortions. Obviously in a broad sense it will affect anyone who can give birth, but do not underestimate how easy it is to be complacent about that sort of issue when it is not currently affecting you.

Trump could totally fumble the next disaster relief effort in a red state and that still would only impact a small group of people. Even the ever rising cost of things will only particularly impact poor people. Tariffs could cause massive supply chain disruptions and most Americans would just accept the Ersatz (replacement) Goods the Trump administration suggested. People will eat their cocoa seed shell and peppercorn milk chocolate. They‚Äôll drink their acorn coffee, and they‚Äôll smear their alfalfa bread with curdled milk instead of butter. We‚Äôll all keep saying that we‚Äôll have had enough any time, but we never will do anything. That‚Äôs how dictatorships are born.

I‚Äôm not saying everyone has to go out in the streets and protest tomorrow, but please think about this and decide what your limits are. Once you have made that decision stand by it and be prepared for whatever happens.",4,1738331781.0,economicCollapse,11,0.83,False

I (28, NB) have had a bad relationship with my older sister since birth. She struggled with not being the only child, and I believe her difficult behavior stemmed from birth trauma‚Äîshe nearly died and spent a week in NICU before my mum even held her. Growing up, she got along better with my younger sister (27), but still yelled and hit, just less. My mum has her own issues, she did hit me 3x when I was young, we've worked it out in therapy since. Dad is mild, triggered by yelling and walks out if it happens in front of him. 

My older sister beat me frequently as a child, invaded my privacy, and constantly insulted me. She would also rat me out to our parents about things like drinking or sex (we're Muslim). While the physical abuse is over she still yells at me, often cursing. I have a trauma response to her yelling, I associate it with getting hit. She‚Äôs also emotionally abusive towards our parents, but they don‚Äôt fight back much because her rage is intimidating. She‚Äôs in therapy, but I suspect she portrays herself as the victim.

I live abroad with my younger sister and only visit our parents once or twice a year. When all of us are here we share one car. My sister took it, and I asked for it back by 3 PM so I could go to the gym. She agreed, but didn‚Äôt return until 4:30. I found out my dad was going to the same gym from work later so I didnt mind it being after 3 anymore. As I was leaving, she announced she needed the car again. I calmly told her I needed it to go to the gym. She yelled at me, cursing and ending the outburst with ""I'm done with you.""

I didn‚Äôt speak to her for two days. My mum was sympathetic, but insisted I couldn‚Äôt ignore her until I got an apology. After a tooth extraction, my sister unexpectedly picked me up, acting sweet and taking me to a coffee shop. Though I didn‚Äôt get the apology I wanted, I accepted that this might be her way of apologizing, and started being friendly again.

Today, my sister blew up at me again over something minor. I simply asked why she did something that affected my schedule, and she exploded, cursing me out. Then, she turned on my mum, expecting her to intervene. My mum ended up yelling at me, saying, ‚ÄúWhy would you ask her that when you know it‚Äôs going to cause a fight?‚Äù I snapped, yelling back, which is very unlike me but with the work we have done on our relationship we made up pretty fast.

Now, my mum wants me to take the high road and not challenge my sister, even though my sister‚Äôs behavior is disrespectful and hurtful. The issue is that every time I assert myself, my sister‚Äôs rage intensifies, and she takes it out on my mum. My mum feels trapped between us and is constantly bombarded with complaints about me from my sister.

It's been brewing my daily cups like a trusty kitchen sidekick, though not without its little imperfections. The 12-cup capacity and front-access design drew me in, but there‚Äôs more to uncover about this coffee maker.

The design is sleek, with a modern black finish that blends well into my kitchen setup. Its compact dimensions (7.95‚ÄùD x 12.9‚ÄùW x 13.9‚ÄùH) make it ideal for tighter spaces, especially since the water reservoir and brew basket are accessible from the front. This feature is a lifesaver if, like me, you‚Äôve cursed at coffee makers that demand you pull them out from under cabinets just to fill them.

Curious about the Hamilton Beach 46310‚Äôs cost? [Check it out on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/hamilton-beach-46310-coffee-maker-review-b07684bplb/)

Brewing performance is where this machine shines. It‚Äôs not the fastest coffee maker on the planet, but it delivers a consistent and smooth cup of coffee. The Select-a-Brew option lets you customize the brew strength‚Äîregular, bold, or 1-4 cups. I found the bold setting to be my sweet spot, especially on groggy mornings. Still, I wish it came with an audio signal to announce when brewing is done. The silence leaves me guessing sometimes.

**Coffee Flavor**

The flavor produced by the Hamilton Beach 46310 is commendable for its price range. It extracts a good depth of flavor from ground coffee, but I noticed that the strength might vary slightly depending on the grind size. The machine‚Äôs performance paired well with medium-ground coffee, giving me rich and balanced cups consistently.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**

Cleaning is straightforward, but the machine does demand attention. The coffee maker features a cleaning reminder, which is handy, although it seems to focus on the number of pots brewed rather than actual need. Resetting the indicator involves unplugging it for 10 minutes, which means reprogramming the clock and brew strength settings afterward‚Äîa minor hassle but worth highlighting.

**Pros**

* The front-fill design eliminates the struggle of awkwardly maneuvering the machine.
* Select-a-Brew strength customization caters to different tastes.
* Automatic shutoff after 2 hours ensures peace of mind for forgetful mornings.
* Cleaning reminders keep maintenance on track.
* Compact design fits well in small spaces.

**Cons**

* The lack of an audible brewing completion signal is noticeable.
* Water level visibility is only on one side, which might be inconvenient depending on your kitchen layout.
* Cleaning reminders can feel overly frequent and require an annoying reset process.
* The carafe design leaves a bit of coffee behind unless you‚Äôre willing to shake it out.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to its rivals, like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker, the Hamilton Beach 46310 stands out for its front-fill design and brew customization. Mr. Coffee offers similar brewing performance but lacks the convenience of front access, making Hamilton Beach the winner for practicality.

On the other hand, the Cuisinart DCC-3200 offers a more premium feel with additional features like a self-cleaning button and more advanced programmability. However, it costs notably more, and for those on a budget, the Hamilton Beach 46310 provides excellent value without sacrificing quality.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Pricing-wise, the Hamilton Beach 46310 is positioned attractively, offering features typically found in pricier models. While it‚Äôs not loaded with bells and whistles, it covers the essentials beautifully. If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable coffee maker with thoughtful design elements, this one delivers solid value for its cost.

**Features in Use**

The programmable timer is a blessing for early mornings. Setting it up the night before means I wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee‚Äîa small joy worth noting. The automatic shutoff after 2 hours is another feature I‚Äôve come to appreciate. For someone who sometimes forgets to turn off appliances, this is a reassuring safety measure.

The included water filter compatibility (sold separately) is a nice touch for those with hard water issues. While I haven‚Äôt tested it with the filter yet, it‚Äôs good to know the option is there. The swing-out brew basket and removable parts make cleaning less of a chore, though the carafe‚Äôs tendency to hold onto the last few drops of coffee is mildly frustrating.

My quals: 9/9/9, 6 month work ex, BCA grad, CAT-85.xx, XAT-84.xx

Panelists: P1- middle aged female, P2- old female, P3 - male

P2 & P3 were polite and welcoming, smiled and nodded appreciatively throughout the process. P1 kept scribbling stuff and grilled. They had the form that I had filled and questions revolved around my profile. Was not asked GK or academic-related questions. Was one of the first candidates to be interviewed, so the panelists were still settling in (asking each other if the coffee was okay lol). I was a little nervous, definitely messed up in few places. 

  
P2: You have done well in academics, what's your secret?

Me: Consistency 

P2: Why don't you pursue something like MSc. Especially since you've been in design industry, why not go there?

Me: Answers how design and marketing go hand in hand, with more scope

P2: Why not go for product design?

Me: Answers 

P2: You've done a lot of extracurricular activities, tell me about it. 

Me: Explains 

P2: What were your job responsibilities at X company? 

Me: Answers 

P3: Asks about my work with UN and how I got the opportunity 

Me: Tells

P3: Asks about gold medal and how many students sat in that Olympiad

Me: Tells (feeling a lil confident at this time) 

P2: What areas do you think government should focus on for women empowerment? (I had mentioned it was one of the areas I was passionate about)

Me: More women from rural areas should enter in the workforce, women safety, RG Kar case... \*interrupted\*

P2: Such cases happen all over the world, even in US and Middle Eastern countries

Me: Justice should be expediated, criminals should be caught quickly (should have said we should aim to be better than those countries with a smile but didn't strike me then) 

P1 takes over 

P1: I still don't understand why you want to go ahead with MBA. You've done multiple internships in design and worked full time. How will MBA help? Go for MSc. Design in NIFT, NID or IITs 

Me: (thinks, tell this to my parents lol) Answers how design is a bit restrictive and MBA opens up more avenues. Shows how my design skills are transferable to marketing with example

P1: With midjourney and other such applications, anyone can design?

Me: Wholeheartedly agrees and shows how designers are still better at giving prompts, tells how prompt engineering has become a job role now and the importance of using right set of words that a designer may know better

P3: Do you want to go into digital marketing? What after MBA?

Me: says I'm open to explore and learn, would want to work for FMCG company 

Extempore: Is education really educating us? (They didn't turn on any timer for me)

Talks about how there is a skill gap. But National Education Policy by CBSE is trying to build the gap. Talks about how students should also be given spiritual knowledge apart from tech and stuff. 

P2: Thank you, what's your CAT scores?

Me: 85.xx

P2: Have you applied at other institutes?

Yes, but you have to break and remove the plastic insert (took one minute with a hammer and screwdriver). You should probably do this regardless as it gets disgusting underneath and doesn't do anything if you're using a non-pressurised basket.

If you typically dose with 18g of grounds then you need the H24 IMS 54mm basket.

1ieertj,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingfeedback/comments/1ieertj/the_painting/,The Painting,"Feedback appreciated. First thing I've written in a while.  


Micheal wasn‚Äôt much of an art critic. Or an artist, for that matter. By his recollection, the last time he‚Äôd held a wet paintbrush he‚Äôd been a teenager. But the painting he found himself looking at now had got to be the most captivating of any he‚Äôd seen up to this point. He‚Äôd seen prettier paintings, larger more ambitious pieces. He‚Äôd visited The Louvre once during his transition year trip to Paris, he remembered spying The Mona Lisa over the tops of tourists' heads. But never had he been more captivated by a piece of art.¬†



Micheal was stood less than a meter away from the hanging canvas, the art enveloped his whole field of view, and he felt as though he was a part of the piece itself. As though he could turn around, and find himself surrounded by patches of brushstrokes and more splashes of paint. Micheal took a few steps back and the strangest thing happened. As the piece shrank in his perspective, Micheal could actually make out even more of the detail on the canvas. He didn't have to squint his eyes to follow one set of fluid brushstrokes around the painting until they were interrupted by another set at a right angle. He followed those and could perceive the cragged ridges of each stroke, and the valleys between them. He couldn't remember being able to do that whilst he had been standing so close.¬†



Counterintuitive as it was, Micheal paced further away from the painting, never once taking his eyes off the artwork, he walked arse first into the bench at the centre of the large gallery, falling onto it with a thud, hurting his tailbone. He was more enthralled than ever with the painting. New details revealed themselves with each step in reverse. He saw the spots where the artist had clumsily messed up their brushing. Spots where the paint had been applied too enthusiastically and ran, yet clung to the canvas. He saw where the canvas had split and frayed, its painted tentacles reaching out from the canvas as if inviting him in. He felt he understood the painting better now.¬† Micheal had never felt as though he had understood a painting before.¬†



He was far enough away now that people were walking between him and the painting, interrupting his sightline. This didn't bother Micheal though, he noticed as each silhouette crossed into his eye line, that they too blended into the artwork seamlessly. He could make out the crow's feet around their eyes, or their peeling, chapped lips, as easily as he could the details of the painting. He wasn‚Äôt even upset when a group of Spanish students, numbering fifteen of sixteen, crowded the space between him and the painting. The figures crossed the painting, one after another, as the moon crosses the sun during an eclipse. They passed, and the details of their faces faded into Micheal‚Äôs peripheral vision, and the focus was again on the exquisite, artwork. He sat there for hours studying the painting, committing every inch of it to memory, and studying the people too.



The next day, on his way home from the office, Micheal took a detour to the gallery to see the painting. He bought a coffee and an almond croissant from the cafe in the foyer and brought them into the hall containing his painting. Ignoring the bench at the centre of the hall, where he had sat yesterday, Micheal walked to the far end of the hall, leaving as much space as possible between him and his painting, he set up camp between two far less interesting paintings, with his back against the wall. There he stood, sipping his cooling coffee, eating his almond croissant, and studying his painting. From this far away Micheal could clearly see the cracks between the separate flecks of paint. He was overcome, for the entirety of the hours that he stood there, with an overwhelming feeling of regret, that to properly see the painting, he had to be so far away. How unfair it was that such an intricate thing could only be comprehended from such a distance. He felt a profound jealousy of every person who walked between him and the painting (at this distance there were many). How envious he was of each of them, as they crossed the space between and were in turn, welcomed into the painting‚Äôs world. Spotlighted by it. Though they had no idea. But Micheal made no move to close the distance. He knew that with every step closer to the painting, detail would be lost, it would become blurry as it grew in his perspective, and envelope him, and the intricacy, where the true beauty of the painting lay, would be lost to him. This routine became a daily ritual for Micheal, and he grew fat on almond croissants.



One day, Micheal walked into the hall where his painting hung, to find another one in its place. He reacted badly, tears welling in his eyes, and a tight knot twisting and turning in his stomach, he thought he was going to shit himself. Upon calming himself, which took a while, he found the nearest attendant and asked about the painting.¬†

‚ÄúWhich painting?‚Äù she responded with disinterest. ‚ÄúOh it was in here? Well everything in here‚Äôs been sent back, t‚Äôwas all part of the same exhibition. On loan. Sure there was a big sign‚Äù.¬†

She pointed to where the big sign had, presumably, once stood.¬†

The twisting knot in Michael's stomach returned. He felt as though he‚Äôd been forced out of his own home. Walking around the hall with nerves, he glanced from canvas to canvas, he‚Äôd never seen any of them before, though he could honestly not recall any singular painting held within this gallery save for his own. Many of the other paintings were far more beautiful than his, there were large landscapes, contemporary abstract pieces, portraits. Most were more technically impressive, may even have had more artistic merit, though none had that supernatural quality of his own. The closer he got to every, single painting, the more details could be distinguished, the further away he got, the more those details were lost until the canvas was hardly a speck on the porcelain white walls of the gallery.¬†



In a panic, he approached the ticket desk in the foyer.¬†

‚ÄúExcuse me, the exhibition in the large hall has ended, the paintings have all been returned‚Äù.

The woman operating the ticket desk looked at him amused. ‚ÄúYes. They have‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúTo where?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

Frantically he asked again. ‚ÄúTo where have the paintings been returned?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo Denmark, the paintings have all been returned to Copenhagen.‚Äù She paused. ‚ÄúIn Denmark‚Äù.¬†



Micheal was on a train to Copenhagen. He had landed at Copenhagen Kastrup Airport, 45 minutes ago and was presently watching the sun rise through the window, on his way into the city. He squinted into the distance, attempting to make out the details on the horizon. A combination of the morning haze and the staccato movement of the train made this very difficult. He was as much a part of this world now, as he had been a part of the paintings the first and only time he had stood so close. The last thing he had eaten had been an almond croissant almost four hours ago,¬† prior to boarding his flight, and he was famished. He didn't mind too much though, it would all be worth it when he saw his painting.¬†



An hour of googling mapsing later, he had found his way to the gallery. An impressive classical building. Micheal walked beneath the high archway, flanked by two gorgeous Romanesque pillars. He registered none of it as he entered the grand entrance hall and purchased for himself a ticket to the gallery's newest installation. Vibrating with excitement, and shaking from hunger, he navigated the spacious halls of the Danish art gallery, painting after painting span by as he locked in on his destination and kicked into a light jog, end nearly in sight, he rounded the last corner.¬†



There it was. Given no more a place of pride than any other of the hundreds of paintings in this cavernous rectangular hall. His painting. It was mounted, two in from the left, on a scarlet wall at the far end of the hall. Immediately he noticed the familiar curves of the brushstrokes as they wound their way around the canvas, merging into larger masses, which gave rise to shapes, which in turn formed the subject of the image. He zoomed in further and noticed some mistakes covered up by the artist lying just beneath the surface of the painting, shielded from a less sharp eye by the layers of paint applied above. He had never noticed that before. He had never been this far away.



It was then that Micheal was able to place himself within the geography of the room. It was a large rectangular hall, two almost impossibly long walls facing one another, garnished with artwork. At the end of each wall, a smaller square wall connected them, it was on one of these walls that Micheal's painting hung. He immediately understood. With the same energy with which he had flown to Denmark, located the Gallery, and his painting within it, Micheal ran to the far wall. A wild grin on his face, he slammed his back against it, he could not have been any further away from his painting. Micheal took a deep breath, steadied himself against the wall, and looked.

[Trump Wants a Trade Deal, Not a Trade War. He May Get One. ‚Äì DNyu](https://dnyuz.com/2025/01/31/trump-wants-a-trade-deal-not-a-trade-war-he-may-get-one/)

https://preview.redd.it/zemi4z8kybge1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=1da7f68cd3096828d404c23b0f316e94b66444a1

By all measures, China seems like the perfect target for Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff hikes. It has the largest trade surplus in goods of all U.S. trading partners, it employs a series of unfair trade practices to gain a competitive advantage, and it has failed to live up to the terms of the trade agreement that it signed with President Trump in his first term.

Still, Mr. Trump hasn‚Äôt imposed new tariffs on China. The 10 percent tariff hike he threatened to impose for its lax fentanyl policies is significantly less than what he promised on the campaign trail. Moreover, it is substantially lower than the 25 percent tariff he may soon put in place against Canada and Mexico.

To be clear, this does not mean that tariffs on Chinese products are off the table. Instead, it means that he may be playing for the biggest possible win, albeit with a significant risk of failure. China is a formidable negotiating partner, so success is far from guaranteed. In the meantime, he seems to be directing his retribution toward America‚Äôs neighbors, with whom he has more leverage, making an early victory on trade more feasible.

Curbing immigration is a key priority for Mr. Trump, so linking tariff threats to efforts to seal the border is not surprising. However, more factors are at play. Both Canada and Mexico, separately, have over three-quarters of their exports destined for the United States, so they are highly dependent on the U.S. market. This dependence provides the United States considerable leverage, and may give Mr. Trump his quick tariff win.

China, on the other hand, presents more challenges. During Mr. Trump‚Äôs first term, Beijing demonstrated its resolve against U.S. tariffs every step of the way. It shrewdly focused its retaliatory duties on politically sensitive sectors, such as agriculture. Since then, it has developed an even bigger retaliatory toolbox, including holding back exports of critical minerals that the United States depends on.

China is already using these new tools. In response to actions the Biden administration took at the end of last year further restricting semiconductor exports to China, Beijing banned the export of gallium, germanium and antimony to the United States and began an antimonopoly investigation against the U.S. semiconductor company Nvidia. China also put a number of American companies on its ‚ÄúUnreliable Entity List‚Äù for sending weapons shipments to Taiwan.

China has also taken steps to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market, by boosting production at home and seeking other export markets. Only about 15 percent of China‚Äôs exports are destined for the U.S. market, a drop of more than four percentage points since 2018. This suggests the United States may have less negotiating leverage this time around, even with a weaker Chinese economy.

The earlier tariff war ended in January 2020 with the so-called Phase One trade agreement, negotiated between the United States and China after years of escalating tension. The agreement included commitments from China to buy certain levels of American goods and to protect intellectual property, among other measures. Mr. Trump was proud, referring to it as ‚Äúa transformative deal that will bring tremendous benefits to both countries.‚Äù

The second phase of the agreement was derailed by Covid; Mr. Trump now appears poised to pick up where he left off. In addition to taking a softer stance on tariffs toward China than expected, he invited President Xi Jinping to his inauguration, extended the time period for selling TikTok and has continued to underscore his ‚Äúvery good relationship‚Äù with Mr. Xi. He has even mentioned visiting China during his first hundred days in office.

Furthermore, Mr. Trump prides himself on doing what others deem impossible or inadvisable and going against those who often focus on the downsides of his bold initiatives, rather than the opportunities. Mr. Trump‚Äôs bromance with Kim Jong-un of North Korea during his first term is a case in point.

Pursuing a new trade deal with China will not be easy. Beijing will be unwilling to alter its state-led economic model, which relies on subsidies, state-owned enterprises and robust industrial policies ‚Äî the basis for many U.S. complaints.

To make a meaningful dent in our trade deficit with China, any trade deal would also need to address two emerging developments. First, global markets in sectors such as electric vehicles, solar panels and steel are being flooded with Chinese products, with no end in sight as Beijing encourages its factories to produce more output in key sectors and domestic demand remains weak. A trade agreement could address this problem through a combination of export restraints by Beijing and meaningful steps to boost consumer demand at home.

Second, Chinese companies have been avoiding U.S. tariffs by moving their operations to other countries. Since 2018, China‚Äôs announced foreign direct investment in Mexico has roughly tripled and has increased by about 170 percent in Vietnam. Any trade deal must address that. Provisions to strengthen rules of origin, which determine whether a product was manufactured in multiple countries, and to impose bans against certain Chinese companies‚Äô exports to the United States should be on the table.

If Mr. Trump does travel to Beijing soon, there will be strong pressure for a big announcement during his stay. But sacrificing substance in order to reach a quick trade deal with China would be a mistake. A wiser approach would be to announce the start of negotiations and lock down a few early ‚Äúdown payments,‚Äù including a ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù purchasing deal to meet the targets set out in the Phase One agreement, as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted in his recent¬†[confirmation hearings](https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/hearing-to-consider-the-anticipated-nomination-of-scott-bessent-of-south-carolina-to-be-secretary-of-the-treasury).

Trying to improve the U.S.-China economic relationship is a laudable goal ‚Äî but only if Mr. Trump approaches those negotiations with the discipline equal to what Beijing will surely bring to the table.

# [AidData | Power Playbook: Beijing‚Äôs Bid to Secure Overseas Transition Minerals](https://www.aiddata.org/publications/power-playbook-beijings-bid-to-secure-overseas-transition-minerals)

***China has invested nearly $57 billion in critical mineral projects across developing countries, positioning itself to dominate key supply chains for clean energy technologies, according to a comprehensive study published this week.***

***The***¬†[***report by AidData***](https://www.aiddata.org/publications/power-playbook-beijings-bid-to-secure-overseas-transition-minerals)***, a research lab at William & Mary, documents China‚Äôs systematic approach to acquiring critical minerals essential for electric vehicles, solar panels, and green technologies between 2000 and 2021.***

***The research found that 83% of China‚Äôs investments supported mining sites partially or wholly owned by Chinese companies. These investments targeted five key minerals: copper, cobalt, lithium, nickel, and rare earth elements.***

***But, unlike conventional resource acquisition, China developed and employed a comprehensive financial ecosystem designed to secure long-term control of critical mineral supply chains.***

***Chinese state-owned banks provided strategic loans with uniquely favorable terms ‚Äî structured financial instruments that enabled Chinese companies to acquire and develop mineral extraction sites in developing countries with minimal risk.***

***For instance, the report highlights that these loans often require Chinese companies to invest their own equity ‚Äî typically 20-30% of project costs ‚Äî which aligns the interests of the banks, companies, and project success. This approach ensures that Chinese firms have a genuine stake in the mineral operations, reducing the likelihood of speculative or unsustainable investments.***

***Most loans meet or exceed the OECD‚Äôs 25% grant element threshold for concessional lending, meaning they‚Äôre priced significantly below market rates, making it substantially easier for Chinese companies to enter and expand in mineral extraction markets where Western firms might find the upfront costs prohibitively expensive.***

***China has effectively lowered the barriers to entry in critical mineral markets, allowing its companies to rapidly secure critical minerals. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, Chinese-controlled companies now account for approximately 51% of cobalt exports.***

***The researchers also discovered that while China initially focused on copper and cobalt, there‚Äôs evidence that it‚Äôs increasingly pivoting towards lithium.***

***‚ÄúA case in point is the package of loans that ICBC, China CITIC Bank, and other Chinese and non-Chinese lenders provided in 2018 to facilitate Tianqi Lithium Corporation‚Äôs acquisition of a 23.77% ownership stake in Sociedad Qu√≠mica y Minera de Chile S.A., one of the world‚Äôs largest producers of lithium,‚Äù they wrote.***¬†

***‚ÄúThis trend has continued in more recent years. In 2022 and 2023, Chinese state-owned creditors provided loans to help Chinese companies acquire the Bikita lithium mine in Zimbabwe and lithium mining rights in Argentina‚Äôs Salta province. They also bankrolled the construction of a lithium clay production plant in Mexico and a lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility in Turkey.***‚Äù

[**Aerospace**](https://www.metalnomist.com/search?q=Aerospace)¬†giant¬†[**Boeing**](https://www.metalnomist.com/search?q=Boeing)¬†has announced an anticipated increase in titanium purchases for 2025, signaling stronger demand despite ongoing labor strikes and challenges with its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner programs. The Virginia-based company aims to secure higher titanium supply levels to support a planned production ramp-up for these aircraft, even as output on the 737 Max has been temporarily halted due to a labor stoppage in the Pacific Northwest.Jeff Carpenter, Boeing's senior director of contracts, sourcing, and category management, addressed delegates at the International Titanium Association (ITA) conference in Austin, noting that Boeing has ""signaled increased buys to all the mills"" for 2025, though exact figures were not disclosed. Boeing‚Äôs increased demand reflects its goal of sustaining production rates while mitigating potential supply chain disruptions, including parts shortages and federally mandated output caps.

# Titanium Requirements: Rising Demand in Aerospace

Boeing has long relied on titanium for its aircraft structures due to its lightweight yet durable properties, essential for both the narrow-body¬†[**737 Max**](https://www.metalnomist.com/search?q=737+Max)¬†and the wide-body 787 Dreamliner. While the 737 Max uses less titanium‚Äîunder 10% by weight‚Äîthe larger 787 comprises approximately 15%¬†[**titanium**](https://www.metalnomist.com/search?q=titanium), making it a major driver of Boeing‚Äôs titanium needs. As the company sets its sights on producing 50 737s per month by 2025-26 and 10 787s per month by 2026, demand for the metal is expected to¬†[climb.In](http://climb.in/)¬†preparation for these ambitious production targets, Boeing has been addressing supply chain bottlenecks, including expanding its supplier base and considering new sourcing strategies. Efforts to localize operations may streamline the titanium supply chain and reduce dependency on overseas forgers, cutting lead times and enhancing production efficiency. Part of this localization includes increased purchases of intermediate titanium forms like slab, which can help Boeing better meet its titanium requirements for future builds.

# Heightened Scrutiny on Certification and Quality Control

Alongside its production goals, Boeing is also calling for more rigorous industry standards in titanium certification following recent findings of fraudulent documentation in some titanium parts. This year, aviation regulators in the U.S. and Europe launched an investigation into titanium parts previously verified with improper documentation. Although Boeing stressed that the quality of the titanium itself is not in question, the company is strengthening oversight to avoid risks associated with sourcing strategies outside its established network.Carpenter urged suppliers at the ITA conference to prioritize diligence in material sourcing and conform to tighter certification standards. Boeing plans to increase inspections and bolster certification training for its distributors, aiming to ensure high-quality material tracking and maintain safety standards.

American Rare Earths (ASX: ARR) has announced a significant increase in resource at its Halleck Creek project in Wyoming, further establishing what is already one of the largest rare earth deposits in North America.

The new JORC-compliant resource estimate now exceeds 2.63 billion tonnes, representing a 12.2% increase over the previous estimate. The resource has an average grade of 3,292 parts per million (ppm) total rare earth oxides (TREO), containing 8.65 million tonnes of TREOs.

# ON 5/27/2022 Jim: How Does Niocorp's Elk Creek Project compare to other ""World Class Projects?""

**REPSONSE:**

*""*¬†***It is a bit tricky to compare rare earth projects on an apples-to-apples basis, which is why we chose to limit the comparison of our Elk Creek resource to other REE projects in the U.S. There are several reasons why.For one, there are several different legal systems that determine how a project can measure and disclose aspects of its mineral resource and/or reserve. For public companies that are SEC-reporting entities (such as NioCorp), the SK1300 standard must be followed. For public companies regulated by Canadian authorities (also such as NioCorp), there is the National Instrument 43-101 disclosure standard. In Australia, there is the JORC standard. Each of these systems differ in what they allow, or don't allow, in terms of public disclosure of mineral resources and reserves. This can lead to 'apples-to-oranges' comparisons among projects.Another challenge in making such comparisons is the mineralization of an REE project. Some projects can show a high ore grade of rare earths, but the mineralization of the ore is something that is very difficult to process. For example, rare earth projects based on silicate-based minerals -- such as eudialyte -- are extraordinarily difficult to economically process in order to pull the REEs out and separate them. Others can contain relatively high levels of other impurities, such as naturally occurring radioactive elements, that can increase the cost of processing. A high ore grade doesn't mean a lot if the REE mineralization isn't amenable to processing that is technically or economically infeasible. This is why only a small handful of the more than 200 REE-containing minerals have ever been successfully processed economically at commercial scale. (The two primary REE-containing minerals in the Elk Creek Project, bastnasite and monazite, are among those that have been successfully processed for decades).Rare earth resources also differ in terms of the relative distribution of individual REEs in the host mineral. Some may have a relatively high ore grade but also have high percentages of less valuable REEs, such as cerium or lanthanum or yttrium. Others have lower ore grades but their REE mineralization is skewed more favorably to higher-value REEs, such as the magnetics neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium which are used in NdFeB magnets. There are several other REEs that are also magnetic, such as samarium, but those are of lower value.Another way that REE projects are compared to one another is through a so-called ‚Äúbasket price.‚Äù This is a particularly misleading way of valuing a rare earth play, in my opinion, because a project‚Äôs ‚Äòbasket price‚Äô assigns a dollar value to the individual REEs in the ore, multiplying total tonnes of each REE by current market price for that REE, and combines them all together. This assumes that a project will produce each and every one of the REEs in the ‚Äòbasket‚Äô (which is almost never the case). It also ignores the enormous CAPEX and OPEX required to produce 14 or so individual REEs.There are yet other factors that help determine the viability of a potential rare earth project.\~Some projects***¬†***are aimed at only producing rare earths. That means that they are relatively riskier investments than projects that are designed to produce multiple products in addition to rare earths.***

***\~Some projects that are relatively large in size, have high ore grades, and are comprised of processable minerals -- but they are located in places that make mining and processing difficult or very expensive. I can think of a few projects that are touted as attractive deposits but are located near or above the Arctic Circle, which generally makes mining more costly.***

***\~ Others are located in places where there local residents, such as First Nations communities in Canada or anywhere in Greenland, can readily block a project from moving to commercial operation. Still others are in countries where local governments are less stable than in the U.S., or are simply prone to corruption, which exposes the project to high country risk.***

***\~Many REE projects are proposed by teams that have no experience in commercially processing REEs. They tend to gloss over that fact. Knowing what I know about the challenges of producing separated, high-purity REEs, this is one of the most important factors I consider when I look at REE projects. But that is just my opinion. A more useful comparison strategy for investors is to look at rare earth projects through multiple lenses, such as those I describe above. It is not easy to do this if one doesn‚Äôt have a pretty deep understanding of the REE industry and the challenges of successfully making these strategic metals. Having said all of that, it‚Äôs clear that our Elk Creek carbonatite is very large and similar in total contained rare earths to some of the largest known rare earth resources in the world, including the Araxa carbonatite in Brazil and the St. Honore carbonatite in Quebec.***

Folks have asked for some specific details on startup failures that I've had, so I'm going to walk you through a detailed explanation of one of them:¬†**Affordit**.

There's a LOT of detail here, and I'm sharing so that you can ask questions and hopefully compare notes with your own startup.

**Background:**¬†I'm a 9x Founder with 5 exits (this wasn't one of them!) over 31 years. I spend all of my time helping Founders understand how to deal with these kinds of disasters so I not only have my only experiences, I've lived through the darkest times of a lot of other Founders as well.

# The Concept

In 2006 I Founded a company called¬†**Affordit**, which was designed to create a simple weekly payment program out of everyday e-commerce purchases. Think ""Xboxes for $19 per week"". Yes, it's almost exactly what Affirm/Klarna is today, but this was before them (you can be too early...)  
It was a phenomenal business idea that I completely fucked up.

# The Funding

Initially, I planned on self-funding the business (I had some exits before this) but upon moving to Los Angeles from Ohio, I started to meet some angels and VCs, all of whom would later form the foundation of what we know of now as ""Silicon Beach"". Many of the most prominent at the time - Mark Suster (now UpFront VC), Mike Jones (now Science, Inc), Dave McClure (now 500 Startups) were incredibly supportive and provided the very first bit of startup capital, many out of their own pockets.

I want to pause there. These meetings didn't go ""kinda well"" - they went ""un-fucking believably well."" This has never happened to me since, and I do this for a living. When I met Mike Jones for the first time, I wasn't even looking for capital, and he said, ""How can I invest?"" He introduced me to Mark Suster the next day, who said, ""How can I invest?"" who I then got connected to Kamran Pourzanjani (founder of PriceGrabber, sold for $300m), who asked, ""How can I invest?""

You have to understand - I hadn't met any of these people before, and they were offering me checks immediately, and they were all ballers in their own right. I was blown away, and apparently, I was fundraising.

That led to a round from Bessemer, Founder's Fund, and Crosscut VC - all great firms. It was a ""big seed"" back then at $1.2m, which is peanuts these days. But at the time, we had the most prominent angels in town, and we were ""the company"". That would be as good as it would ever get.

# The Business

It turns out when you sell Xboxes for $19 per week, people want them. A lot of them. We sold $500,000 worth of Xboxes in our FIRST MONTH with a tiny Adwords campaign. Did we own $500,000 worth of Xboxes? Absolutely not. We were driving around town in a rented minivan, going to every Best Buy and Circuit City (different era) we could find, loading it up like we were ready for the apocalypse. It was insane.

If you're an angel investor (or any investor) and you hear that the startup you just invested in did $500,000 worth of sales in its first month, you lose your shit. I was getting every possible introduction you could possibly get to every VC there possibly was. If you were a VC in 2006, chances are I was in your office telling you a very plausible story about how this is going to be the next... well, this is funny - what is actually now Affirm or Klarna.

Everything was on FIRE. Everyone wanted me to speak at their event, I was throwing big parties on the rooftop of my Santa Monica building, and I was on top of the world. We were getting competing term sheets like crazy.

# The Market

Heading into 2007/2008, two things happened that we simply never saw coming. First, this little investment bank called Lehman Brothers melted down as part of a larger financial crash. All of a sudden, ""FinTech,"" especially those that were essentially high-interest rate sellers (like us), were in the crosshairs big time.

Overnight, we went from everyone throwing term sheets at us to being toxic. Every VC pulled their term sheet, which was a bigger problem because we had long since run out of money (remember that tiny raise and all of those Xboxes we had to buy?), and I was funding this thing out of my own pocket (never do that). I was 10000% sure that we were getting funded, so I thought I was going to MAKE money on the float. I did not.

# The Model

A second thing happened while this thing was heading to the land of dumpster fires. We had to start collecting all of those weekly payments. Well, it turns out, the people who can't afford to pay full price for an Xbox were the same people who didn't have $19 per week.

You want to know who our number one customer archetype was? No, not 20-year-old college kids. It was single moms trying to buy a present for their kids (remember that $500k in the first month - that was Xmas). I grew up with a single mom and never met my father till later in life. You want to know how excited I was to be collecting from single moms like mine trying to provide something special for their kids? Zero. Less than zero. NFW.

I figured this was fixable with different customer targeting, but something inside me knew that I had painted myself into a corner of a business I didn't actually want to see succeed but had committed to so many people so publicly that it should.

# The Wind Down

If there's anything I want you to take from this story, it's not the funding or the business concept - it's how it ended. I was humiliated. I had nothing but success in my previous ventures, and this was a very public failure. I don't know how many of you have been in a community of folks, but when you see people at coffee shops and they deliberately avoid you, not because they don't like you but because they are embarrassed for you - it sucks. That's a tiny microcosm of the feeling, but for those of you that have lived it - you get it.

I spent every waking hour for the next 18+ months trying to resurrect this company (unsuccessfully), and I learned a few powerful lessons. The first is that no one ever tells you, ""Hey, it's time to go home."" They will let you run yourself as far into the ground as you can go. It's not their fault - they have no incentive to stop you. That's your fault.

The second issue is that there is a point in our startups where we are no longer trying to succeed - we're simply trying to NOT fail. That works never. The moment we're in that death loop, we've already lost. Who do you know that wants to work for or invest in a company whose goal is to ""not fail""? No one.

The third point is that all this time I built up this horrible nightmare of what it would mean to shut this company down. The giant fights with disappointed investors, the press coverage, the looks on my co-workers' faces. I agonized to avoid this fate, shaving years off my life.

You know what happened? Nothing. Not a goddamn thing. I sat down with our lead investor, and he looked at me and said, ""Yeah, we wrote this thing off like 2 years ago - we were shocked you were still running it."" (OK, would have been useful information 2 years ago, but...) You know what the press said? Nothing. Because no one gives a shit. My team had other jobs before I even had a chance to tell them it was over.

# The Takeaway

At the time, the fall of that company was the worst failure I had ever had in my life. I was depressed, humiliated, and financially took a major hit. I had no idea how I would ever recover. That was 17 years ago, I was 33 years old.

Do you know, in the time that it took me to write this story, that's about as much time as I've ever thought about it since? I can barely remember what happened beyond what I just wrote. It was at best a blip in my career and a depressing footnote. 99% of my present life today (family, career, life) hadn't even happened up until that point in my life.

i am having second thoughts/regrets about starting/getting this job and it's more to do with my financial future than the job itself. as said above, it's something i really wanna do (translation) in a place i like (library) and i went to school for (english); however, the pay is frankly kinda low compared to other ministries/institutions that recruited people with my degree. it makes me feel like i made the wrong choice, that i should've went for those higher paying places instead. hell, maybe i should've went corporate or startup instead. 

in my mind, going for those places would let me live a better life. i could just not think about whether my salary will be enough to buy a trinket i really covet or starting a new hobby i want. i could live in an actual apartment rather than a boarding house (no offense to the house itself, it's lovely, but my room is tiny!). i could have a car, i could buy lots of new good quality clothes, i could go to concerts and malls and other experiences without worrying about money so much. basically, i can live to the fullest like I'm supposed to in my age.

on the other hand, i am proud of getting it in the first place. i fought tooth and nail for it, studied for three months straight, was sick for the second round of entrance test and still got the highest score for that position. it's extremely stable and progression is at least clear (although me being a multi-minority, it'll probably be arduous). i have health insurance and pension, i could apply to civil worker-specific scholarships when i want to go for that. professional translation is pretty hard to break in as well. i am here rightfully, with my effort, not my family's connections.

i guess part of me hates myself for being extremely money conscious as well. knowing how to budget, to not be careless with money especially with my current position, the value of investing and saving early however small... sometimes i wish i could just drop a ton of money on anything that i want instead of having to wait a few months to save up for it! i want to be like my average ""spend when you want"" peers, not this personal finance conscious weirdo. i wish i had the taste to enjoy buying and owning branded stuff, not comparing prices and waiting for a discount to buy the best bang for your buck option. 

sometimes i wanna be that girl with new branded bag and clothes and accessories sipping an expensive coffee in an overpriced cafe, but that's not me and i hate it. the ""real"" me is someone who enjoys food still, but in a more decently priced place, wearing and using something i've owned for a long time, content with all of it.

idk, maybe this is just my quarter life crisis or something like that. fomo, comparing myself, all of that stuff... but also it feels like i have valid grievances at myself for not being able to relate to a good section of my peers.

Last summer vacation I went on a trip with my parents, my boyfriend, my boyfriend's parents , my parents goddaughter and her husband and her daughter  and a couple, good friends of my parents. I am 21 years old as well as my boyfriend. The whole story started when my boyfriend and I forgot our car registration and had to go back from the road to get it. We changed the arrangement in the cars and we went back, even so there were 11 people in total with three cars, my parents' car, where they and our godfriends , were a couple plus their 21 year old daughter, my and my boyfriend's car where me and my boyfriend plus his parents were and the car of the couple of friends (S-husband and D-wife). S and D were our holiday buddies for many years, and they watched me grow up, and I started to see them more as godparents than as friends of my parents. We arranged the cars so that S and D would be alone in the car because of an incident in the past when without informing in advance S asked my parents godson for a sum of money for the trip because he had consumed diesel with him (the amount was enough to cover all the fuel for the entire holiday). When they found out that no one wanted to go with them they were upset, but they had nothing to comment on, they asked me if I wanted to come with them but I was already one of the drivers booked on one of the cars (the trip was for 1200 km so we wanted to have at least two drivers per car so we could take turns). With a sigh we arrived at the guesthouse where we were staying and went to the beach, the main problem came from the food, having a guesthouse we would have been cheaper to cook than going to a restaurant and when we went shopping we paid together, S didn't like it at all because they were only 2 people while the rest were families of 3... but the ladies, the wives had already been to the store and had already done their shopping. On the second trip to the store, he and I came, I put a bag of seeds in my basket (guilty pleasures) and went to look around the store, after which I heard him from a distance of 3-4 ailes , ""who put these in the basket, I don't pay for what I don't consume"", I was very embarrassed even though I was in a foreign country and most likely only my group understood him. I went to him and told him that I bought them and to stop making commotion in the store, the moment he threw the bag at my chest and told me that he only pays for what he consumes. I found his attitude and the way he talked to me rude‚Ä¶ so every time I saw him with a food in his hand that not everyone would have eaten, I told him,, pay for it yourself because I only pay for what I consume,, the third time he bad another screaming fit  in the store‚Ä¶ at which point I said that I I said I made myself understood‚Ä¶
When I got to the accommodation D started arguing with me in front of everyone because we shared the living room and I didn't clean up after myself (my boyfriend and I were the last to go up to the room but we weren't the ones who made the mess on the coffee table) at which point I explained to her that the wives (her included) made the rule that one persen will pick after himself and himself alone (the men had drinking and backgammon sessions in the evening and left a mess) and that it was not my responsibility to clean up after someone else . She started with the argument that being a girl it was my responsibility to maintain cleanliness. I didn't want to make a scene so I didn't give her any more reason to argue, but when she got up to the room I went after her and told her everything that was bothering me, including the incident with her husband. When to leave S got in the room and I went out, I heard arguments and doors slamming and inevitably I prepared myself for the fight that was to come. A 57-year-old man, 1.90 m tall and 120 kg, came to me 21 years old, 80 kg and 1.70 m tall to tell me that I am uneducated, insensitive and many other things because I lie shamelessly, that he did not throw the bag in my face... I let him scream, you know the saying, ""the dogs bark, the bear walks"", my mother came to my defense and asked him why he makes me educated and if his behavior towards me seems healthy to him, he asked her if she really believes me, a liar, and my mother replied that she did not know what happened in the store, but she saw with her own eyes how S jumped on me and started screaming, yelling and insulting me. Things calmed down, even though I felt very wronged I tried to be civil with him for the sake of the other people in the group who were still on vacation. By the end of the vacation S would talk to anyone who would tell him that I was an uneducated liar, fat and ugly and that I didn't know my place as a woman... On the last night things exploded when we went to a restaurant and he made the statement that my mother-in-law and I (the sweetest woman on earth, who gets along with anyone and wouldn't hurt a fly) needed 2 chairs each at the restaurant because of our size. The woman was so embarrassed that she even had a tiny salad when she hadn't eaten all day... We arrived home, in the country, and my parents had cut off all contact with them, D tried to contact them again but they refused to even talk to them on the phone.

1ieek25,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mr-Topper/comments/1ieek25/skateboards_and_sausage_dogs_part_2/,Skateboards and Sausage Dogs - Part 2,"At the start of June in 2021, I had just ended a relationship and was set to start a new job.

I did an online interview, and it seemed to go well - so I was invited to an in-person interview at a local coffee shop.

The day before the interview, I met up with an old friend. I say ""old friend"" because he is not my friend anymore - and not because we went way back

He invited me out to go to visit a mutual friend who lived close by to the place where the UK stores it's nuclear weapons - Faslane.

I had heard stories about the ""hippie commune"" right outside of the base.

Anyway. We spent some time at our mutual friend's house before leaving to go for a drive around Faslane.

Just as we were leaving, this guy's parents were just arriving. I had never met them before, and I have never seen them since.

But we greeted each other, handshakes and all the usual pleasantries that you get from people that are slightly more posh than average.

We went for a drive, and had a peek at this ""hippie commune"". It was nothing like the stories I had heard. It looked totally abandoned. Nature had started to reclaim the caravans and tents scattered around.

I suppose a *true* hippie would be happy to see nature shine through, so maybe it's not so bad?

Anyway, anyway, anyway. We continue to drive around, going up The Old Military Road.

The only time in my life I ever experienced ""getting air"" in a car - as we flew up this road shaped like a Sine wave.

Myself, and my old friend, were passengers. The guy driving was training to be a pilot. I didn't bother trying to remind him that the car was not a fucking plane.

We stopped at a scenic location for a short wander and had a smoke. Eventually we got back in the car and started to head back home.

It was a nice summers day, particularly rare in Scotland. A little bit of sunlight up north will turn a dreary landscape into something beautiful.

So, the next day, I have my in-person interview.

I meet my soon-to-be boss, and my soon-to-be manager. I was being interviewed alongside another web developer, but we were not in competition. We both ended up on the same team.

We are chatting away, my boss' partner owned the coffee shop where we met - so we were fed and watered for our troubles.

Since the weather was so nice, the coffee shop had set up chairs and seats outside. This is honestly so rare in Scotland, that you really ought to savour the chance.

If you lived in say, Rome, you could hang out all day drinking coffee and soaking up the vitamin D. But that just isn't life in Scotland.

So as we are being interviewed, some guy who looked like a stereotypical film director (you know, cap and glasses and all that jazz) approached our table. He had a camera. A big bastard camera.

They wanted to do interviews for the BBC - asking people what they thought about the COVID lockdown and if they thought it was a good thing or not.

I'm not sure if I immediately volunteered, but as I looked around the table it didn't seem like anyone was willing to be interviewed.

""Don't you want to be on the telly?"" I asked.  I agreed to give my thoughts to the camera guy.

So, there I am, being interviewed while I am being interviewed.

I vaguely recall saying something about how having cabin fever doesn't change the reality of the situation - that it's better for the majority of people to be healthy and bored than sick and entertained.

At the end of my little ramble, the camera guy remarked that it was surprisingly thoughtful.

I was not sure if he was being a cheeky bastard for implying his expectations of my hometown were so low, or if I had actually been thoughtful.

So, the interview ends, and then the interview ends. I survived interview-ception and lived to tell the tale.

And I got the job! This was great news, it gave me something to do other than post-breakup dossing about.

I wondered to myself if anyone I know might see the interview. I had no idea when it might air.

I was thinking my parents might like to see it. I also considered that it would be funny if my mate's parents - whom I had met briefly the day before - saw it.

I didn't think it likely - I just thought it would be funny.

As it happens, they saw me later that night. They were scratching their heads apparently like ""Wasn't that boy here just yesterday? Wtf"".

My mate sent me a video of it, and I thought it was hilarious. He patted me on the back for ""not making a fool of myself"".

I work away for a couple of months at my new job as a web developer. My boss wanted to go to a networking event and invited myself and another of the staff to come on the trip.

At the time I thought ""Ye fuck it!"" but looking back, I probably should have been paid much more for my time. My boss seemed to like money - despite being a fairly outspoken Christian.

So, I once again agreed to go to Birmingham. I was set to drive down with my boss and my colleague on the 18th September.

I had done something.... a bit questionable.... the night before - so I was glad to get out of my flat for a bit.

Wasn't sure if hurtling down to Birmingham was really the answer to my problems - but it's what we were doing.

1ieeinb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ieeinb,1 month down,So wanted to share my progress so far. Started january 6th at 305lbs i started that Monday so Monday and Tuesday i fast then Wednesday i eat in a 30 minute window Thursday and Friday I fast Saturday and Sunday i eat. When I fast I only drink water with non iodine sea salt or black coffee. For my food I eat a chicken breast (or other protein) a fair bit of veggies and 2 or 3 hard boiled eggs sometimes I'll have a couple slices of brick cheese. On Sunday I'll have a couple beers as a treat. This week I am doing a 6 day fast Sunday I'm going to eat to prep for the next weeks usual schedule. So technically 22.2 pounds lost in less than a month I'd say is not bad. My biggest thing is cravings or at least being a bit hungry and just wanting something small i try to drink water to help curb it but I think its just mental at that point. Yesterday I was super tempted as I did feel a little light headed and my body felt really light and odd but I am guessing I needed more hydration which after I put a pinch of salt under my tongue i started to feel better I actually went to the gym like i normally do and i was fine I usually go for low intensity cardio that i will eventually ramp up to higher intensity. My goal is to get to 200lbs in 5 more months wish me luck. ,50,1738329323.0,fasting,15,0.95,False

1ieehce,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1ieehce/some_thoughts_on_the_australian_vaping_ban/,Some thoughts on the Australian vaping ban,"TLDR: Australian Government introduced vaping ban and fucked it  
  
Alright, buckle up because we're about to dive deep into the colossal clusterfuck that is the Australian government's vaping crackdown. This isn't just a minor policy hiccup; it's a full-blown shitstorm of epic proportions that's turned the country's vaping landscape into a dystopian nightmare.

The Black Market Bonanza

Let's start with the crown jewel of this monumental cock-up: the booming black market. The government's brilliant plan to restrict vaping has backfired spectacularly, creating a thriving illegal trade that would make Al Capone proud. We're talking about an estimated 120 million disposable vapes being smuggled into the country annually, like it's some kind of twisted advent calendar for nicotine addicts.

But wait, it gets better! These aren't your run-of-the-mill smugglers. No, we're dealing with organized crime groups, the same lovely folks who traffic drugs and humans. They've found a new golden goose in the vape market, and they're milking it for all it's worth. The profit margins are so juicy, even if eight out of ten shipments get nabbed, these criminal masterminds are still laughing all the way to the bank.

Violence and Chaos: The New Normal

Hold onto your hats, because this is where it gets really wild. The vape black market has sparked a turf war that makes the Wild West look like a kindergarten playground. We're talking firebombings, public executions, and good old-fashioned intimidation. In Victoria alone, over 30 tobacco shops have been firebombed in the past year. It's like the government decided to spice things up by adding a touch of organized crime to the local business scene.

And let's not forget the charming ""Earn or Burn"" ultimatum being offered to tobacconists. It's a simple choice really: sell our illegal vapes or watch your shop go up in flames. It's the kind of business proposition that really puts the ""fire"" in ""entrepreneurial fire"".

Environmental Disaster: Because Who Needs a Habitable Planet Anyway?

But why stop at creating a crime wave when you can also royally fuck up the environment? The government's crackdown has led to a surge in disposable vapes, which are about as eco-friendly as a tire fire. These little bastards are a triple threat: plastic waste, electronic waste, and hazardous waste all rolled into one convenient, planet-destroying package.

Each discarded vape is a ticking time bomb of environmental destruction. The plastics take centuries to degrade, the lithium batteries are a fire hazard, and the e-liquids are basically poison for aquatic life. It's like the government looked at the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and thought, ""You know what? Let's make one of those, but with added nicotine and fire risk.""

The Vaping Surge: Task Failed Successfully

Here's the kicker: despite all this draconian bullshit, vaping numbers are skyrocketing faster than a SpaceX rocket on steroids. We're looking at a 30% year-on-year increase, with nearly 400,000 Australians picking up the habit in just one year. It's almost as if making something forbidden makes it more appealing. Who could have possibly seen that coming? Oh, right, anyone with a basic understanding of human psychology or a passing familiarity with the history of prohibition.

Business Apocalypse: Goodbye Jobs, Hello Unemployment

But why stop at fueling organized crime and environmental destruction when you can also decimate an entire industry? The government's vape ban has effectively signed the death warrant for every legitimate vape business in the country. With less than a week's notice, these business owners were told to cease all trading of vaping products. It's the kind of swift, thoughtful action you'd expect from a toddler with a sledgehammer, not a national government.

These business owners are now left holding the bag, grappling with lease obligations, financial commitments, and the sudden realization that their livelihoods have gone up in smoke faster than a defective vape pen. It's a masterclass in how to create unemployment and economic instability in one fell swoop.

The Enforcement Farce

Now, you might be thinking, ""Surely they're enforcing these new laws with the utmost diligence?"" Well, buckle up for another disappointment. The enforcement of these vaping laws is about as effective as a chocolate teapot. In New South Wales, there are a whopping seven inspectors tasked with policing thousands of illicit vape sales outlets. Seven. You'd have better luck finding a unicorn than stumbling upon effective enforcement of these laws.

And when they do manage to make a bust? It's like celebrating finding a grain of sand on a beach. Sure, they might seize 100,000 vapes here and there, but that's chump change in a market worth an estimated $500 million in Victoria alone. It's like trying to empty the ocean with a teaspoon while someone's hosing it down with a fire truck.

The Youth Vaping Epidemic: A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

Let's not forget about the kids, because the government certainly hasn't. In their infinite wisdom, they've managed to make vaping so taboo and illicit that it's become irresistible to young people. The latest stats show that one in two people aged 18-24 have tried vaping, with current use among young females skyrocketing from 2.4% in 2019 to a staggering 20% in 2022-2023.

It's almost as if by trying to protect the youth, they've inadvertently created a generation of nicotine addicts. Bravo, government! Your nanny state approach has worked wonders in making vaping the forbidden fruit that every teenager can't wait to sink their teeth into.

The Prescription Paradox

In a twist of irony so delicious it could give you diabetes, the government has decided that the only legal way to obtain vapes is through a prescription. Because nothing says ""reducing harm"" like forcing people to jump through medical hoops to access a product that was previously available over the counter. It's a bureaucratic nightmare that's about as sensible as requiring a doctor's note to buy a cup of coffee.

This approach has created a bizarre scenario where vaping is simultaneously treated as a medical intervention and a criminal activity. It's like the government is playing good cop/bad cop with itself, and the public is left scratching their heads in confusion.

The International Embarrassment

While countries like New Zealand have managed to create regulated, legal markets for vapes with minimal black market activity, Australia has decided to go full prohibition. It's like watching your neighbor successfully grow a beautiful garden while you set fire to your own backyard and call it landscaping.

This approach has transformed what were largely legal and peaceful markets into increasingly dangerous and uncontrolled ones. It's a masterclass in how to create problems where none existed before, and it's put Australia on the map for all the wrong reasons.

The Environmental Hypocrisy

Let's circle back to the environment because the government's approach here is a special kind of stupid. While they're busy patting themselves on the back for banning plastic straws, they've inadvertently created a tsunami of non-recyclable, hazardous waste in the form of disposable vapes.

These vapes are an environmental nightmare, containing everything from non-biodegradable plastics to toxic e-liquids and lithium batteries. It's like the government decided to play environmental bingo and managed to tick off every box for ""ways to fuck up the planet.""

The Health Confusion

In their zealous crusade against vaping, the government has managed to muddy the waters on harm reduction. While no one's claiming vaping is completely safe, it's widely recognized as less harmful than traditional smoking. But thanks to the government's approach, you'd think vaping was on par with mainlining plutonium.

This conflation of risks has left the public in a state of confusion, potentially driving some back to traditional cigarettes. It's like warning people off salad because it might have some calories and then watching them reach for a deep-fried stick of butter instead.

The Economic Drain

Let's talk money, because this clusterfuck isn't just a social and health disaster ‚Äì it's an economic sinkhole. The black market for vapes means millions in lost tax revenue, money that could have been used for, oh, I don't know, literally anything else. Instead, that cash is lining the pockets of criminals who are probably using it to fund other illegal activities.

Add to that the cost of enforcement, the strain on the healthcare system from people potentially returning to smoking, and the economic impact of shuttering legitimate businesses, and you've got a financial disaster of epic proportions.

The Policy Paralysis

Perhaps the most infuriating aspect of this whole debacle is the government's stubborn refusal to admit they've royally fucked up. Instead of acknowledging the tsunami of negative consequences and pivoting to a more sensible approach, they're doubling down harder than a blackjack player with a gambling addiction.

This policy paralysis is turning what could have been a minor misstep into a generational disaster. It's like watching someone repeatedly slam their head against a wall and insisting it's an effective way to open a door.

Conclusion: A Monument to Failure

In conclusion, the Australian government's approach to vaping regulation is a towering monument to failure, a testament to the power of unintended consequences, and a masterclass in how to create a problem while trying to solve one. It's a policy so spectacularly misguided that it almost defies belief.

From fueling organized crime and environmental destruction to decimating businesses and driving up youth vaping rates, there's hardly an aspect of society that hasn't been negatively impacted by this ham-fisted approach to regulation.

It's a stark reminder that when it comes to public policy, the road to hell is paved with good intentions ‚Äì and apparently, that road is littered with discarded vape pens, firebombed shops, and the shattered dreams of business owners.

The government has managed to create a situation where everyone loses: vapers, non-vapers, business owners, law enforcement, and the environment. It's a fuck-up of such magnificent proportions that it almost deserves a slow clap ‚Äì if it weren't so goddamn tragic.

So here we are, stuck in a dystopian vaping landscape of the government's own making, watching as the situation spirals further out of control with each passing day. It's enough to make you want to bang your head against a wall ‚Äì or maybe take up vaping, if you can find a black market dealer who hasn't been firebombed yet.",0,1738329204.0,australia,34,0.4,False
1ieeg2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Effexor/comments/1ieeg2c/one_week_down_my_experience_so_far/,One week down. My experience so far,"This has been a rollercoaster of a week. I came off of 150mg of Effexor (took this for 10-15 years with some failed attempts to quit between then and now) using the Prozac bridge, and I‚Äôve had a lot of good and bad experiences. Today I feel like I‚Äôm finally a bit better after a week of withdrawal effects. 

For the good so far:
-More libido, though it isn‚Äôt maybe fully healed yet. Still much better than it was, and that happened within just a couple days of quitting. 
-Having emotions! I was so emotionless and blunted on Effexor, and now I feel more emotions overall: good, bad, and everywhere in between. I do have moments of intense sadness, but I‚Äôm generally able to hold it together. I just feel more connected to the human experience and others around me. Before I often felt like a passive bystander in my own life.
-Possibly less fatigued? It‚Äôs hard to say where my fatigue level is at since things are still a bit hazy with withdrawals, but I don‚Äôt feel nearly as exhausted all the time like I was on Effexor. 
-Less reactionary overall. Effexor sometimes made me so pissy, often with very little reason, and I think I feel a lot more chill now. 
-Less sweat! I used to sweat all the time, whether it was from hot weather or extremely cold weather. It was so embarrassing. It seems like I can handle the weather a lot more now. 

The bad:
-My anxiety and panic are so high throughout the day. I‚Äôve been meditating each day, but the progress is slow. I made the mistake of having a second coffee today, and I felt so stressed and anxious afterward. One coffee is gonna have to be sufficient for a while. 
-Chills/overheating have been a big issue so far. I don‚Äôt get sweaty randomly like before, but both  cold and hot temperatures really affect me right now.
-My sleep is a bit shit. Just doesn‚Äôt seem restful, and I seem to wake several times throughout the night. 
-My digestion is also really rough right now. It seems like I have a bit of diarrhea each day, often for no reason. 
-Finally, I‚Äôm still a bit jumpy. Like loud noises or surprises really startle me, and it feels like my body is still working to calm down. It is much better now than it was just a couple days ago. 

Other than that, I‚Äôm still on 10mg of Prozac, but I feel really good about my prospects of quitting the Effexor this time. I know withdrawals can sneak up on you even a month or more in the future, so I‚Äôm gonna stay on the Prozac for a short while until I feel more stable. Then I‚Äôll quit that. If any of you have questions or whatever, feel free to ask. I know quitting Effexor can be scary, so I‚Äôd love to help in whatever way I can. ",3,1738329092.0,Effexor,0,1.0,False

I spent an agonizing night laying on the floor beside him while he was suffering, unable to do anything to give him comfort, until the vet opened in the morning. I really thought they would be able to do something. I didn't even imagine we'd be facing that decision. I thought it would be one bad night and he would be his usual self in a day or two after seeing the vet. He went downhill so fast and I just wanted to give him one more happy day so badly. He was such a happy, vibrant cat. In the end he couldn't purr, couldn't get comfortable, and couldn't bring himself to eat a bite of his favorite snack even though he wanted it. I know I did what I had to to protect him from pain and suffering he did not deserve. I know he had so many happy days. I know he knew I loved him and got so much love. But I still feel guilty. I still wish I had given him more. I wish I had given him extra treats last week and stayed in bed to snuggle for as long as he wanted. I still wonder if I had done things differently if he would have suffered less. And walking around my house is so painful, because everything reminds me of him. The spot where he liked to sit in the kitchen. The laundry I started and forgot about on the day he got sick. My bed, where he would always lay with me. Even the bathroom makes me sad because he liked to follow me in there and would yell if I didn't let him. Or the fact that I don't have to be careful about leaving a towel or a blanket on the floor, because they won't wind up getting peed on now. That was a nuisance, but I feel like I wish I had the nuisance. Pouring coffee makes me tear up because I would go pet him while I waited for it to boil. There are all these tiny ways he was part of every moment of my life and I feel his absence in all of them. It's difficult to explain to the people around me that I'm crying because my cat won't knock my face wipes off the table anymore. I don't know if there's anything that will make those moments easier other than time. It's such a struggle. And I never know when that will hit me. Or when I'm going to encounter ads on YouTube and every website I visit for the medication he needed from Chewy, or pet insurance, or the specialty cat food he needed too. My only option to manage those ads is ""see less of this topic."" I wish I could request to never see pet ads again. It's so awful because it reminds me that 3 days ago, I had hope and plans to manage his condition and was determined to take care of him. Now the pet who has been by my side through every hardship and gave me so much unconditional love is gone.",4,1738328663.0,Petloss,1,1.0,False
1ieeax0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniLife101/comments/1ieeax0/the_balancing_act_of_university_life/,The Balancing Act of University Life,"I remember being wide-eyed and excited during my first week at university, convinced I‚Äôd perfectly balance academics, a social life, and even get eight hours of sleep every night. Needless to say, reality set in. Between back-to-back lectures, group projects, and endless readings, it became clear that my ‚Äúperfect schedule‚Äù was more dream than reality. What really kept me going was the small stuff: chatting with a classmate while waiting for the professor, discovering a cozy study nook in the library, and grabbing coffee with friends after a grueling midterm.

It took me a while to accept that it‚Äôs normal to feel overwhelmed at times. College doesn‚Äôt come with an instruction manual, and each semester feels like a brand-new puzzle with shifting pieces. But every challenge is also a chance to learn something new about who I am and what matters to me. Taking a break when it‚Äôs needed, embracing a flexible study routine, and allowing time for personal hobbies has helped me keep burnout at bay.

If you‚Äôre in the thick of it now, remember you‚Äôre not alone. Everyone‚Äôs juggling deadlines, group chats, and late-night study sessions.

1iee9tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/espressocirclejerk/comments/1iee9tj/exposing_respresso_the_bitter_truth_behind_the/,Exposing r/espresso: The Bitter Truth Behind the Hype,"Ah, r/espresso‚Äîa subreddit that claims to be a haven for coffee enthusiasts, a place where people gather to share their love for the perfect shot of espresso. But peel back the layers of crema, and you‚Äôll find something far more sinister brewing: a carefully orchestrated astroturfing campaign designed to sell you overpriced, unnecessary gadgets and accessories. Welcome to the dark roast underbelly of the coffee world, where manufacturers and influencers have turned your passion into a profit machine.

# The Cult of Consumerism

The first thing you‚Äôll notice about r/espresso is that it‚Äôs not actually about espresso‚Äîit‚Äôs about buying espresso *stuff.* Every conversation about technique somehow veers into hardware recommendations. Dialing in your grind? Better upgrade to a premium burr grinder. Inconsistent shots? Probably time to swap out that cheap $800 machine for a $2,000 one.

This relentless push toward premium equipment isn‚Äôt organic‚Äîit‚Äôs engineered. It‚Äôs the product of a coordinated effort by manufacturers and retailers who infiltrate these spaces to generate hype around their products. It starts with glowing ""user reviews"" (often suspiciously well-written and detailed for a casual hobbyist) and continues with ""community"" members eagerly parroting the same talking points: that spending more money is the *only* way to get good espresso.

# The Illusion of Expertise

At first glance, r/espresso seems like a community of knowledgeable coffee lovers. Users post pictures of their meticulously crafted setups, complete with gleaming machines, precision scales, and an array of tools that would make a barista blush. But look closer, and you‚Äôll notice a pattern: the same products are constantly being recommended, often with little justification beyond vague claims of ‚Äúimproved extraction‚Äù or ‚Äúbetter workflow.‚Äù

These recommendations are rarely organic. Instead, they‚Äôre the result of a well-coordinated effort by manufacturers to infiltrate the community and push their products. From the latest $200 tamper to the ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù WDT tool (because apparently, a toothpick just won‚Äôt cut it anymore), every piece of gear is marketed as essential for achieving the perfect shot. The truth? Most of it is overhyped nonsense designed to separate you from your money.

# The Cult of the Grinder

No discussion of r/espresso would be complete without mentioning the obsession with grinders. According to the subreddit, your grinder is the single most important piece of equipment in your setup‚Äînever mind that a decent grinder can cost as much as a used car. The constant drumbeat of ‚Äúgrind finer‚Äù and ‚Äúupgrade your grinder‚Äù is not just advice; it‚Äôs a sales pitch.

Manufacturers have successfully convinced the community that anything less than a $1,000 grinder is a waste of time. Never mind that people have been making perfectly good espresso for decades with far simpler equipment. The goal here is to create a sense of inadequacy, to make you believe that your current setup is holding you back. And once you‚Äôve bought into that idea, the sky‚Äôs the limit when it comes to spending.

# The Accessory Arms Race

But it doesn‚Äôt stop at grinders. The espresso accessory market is a goldmine for manufacturers, and r/espresso is their playground. From precision baskets to pressure profiling kits, there‚Äôs always something new to buy. And if you dare to question the necessity of these products, you‚Äôll be met with a chorus of voices insisting that you just don‚Äôt understand the ‚Äúscience‚Äù of espresso.

Let‚Äôs be clear: most of these accessories are solutions in search of a problem. Do you really need a $50 distribution tool to tamp your coffee? Probably not. But when the community is flooded with posts praising these products, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like you‚Äôre missing out. And that‚Äôs exactly what the manufacturers are counting on.

# The Influencer Industrial Complex

Of course, none of this would be possible without the help of influencers. These self-proclaimed coffee gurus dominate r/espresso, posting endless reviews and tutorials that just happen to feature the latest and greatest products. What they don‚Äôt tell you is that many of these influencers are being paid‚Äîeither directly or through free products‚Äîto promote these items.

The result is a feedback loop where influencers push products, manufacturers reap the profits, and unsuspecting customers are left with a cupboard full of gadgets they don‚Äôt need. It‚Äôs a win-win for everyone except the people who actually matter: the coffee drinkers.

# The Astroturfing Playbook

Manufacturers and retailers have figured out that traditional advertising is too obvious, so they‚Äôve taken a more insidious approach: infiltrate online communities, plant enthusiastic ""users,"" and let word-of-mouth do the rest. Some classic signs of astroturfing on r/espresso:

* **Suspiciously consistent product recommendations.** Certain brands get endlessly pushed as ""must-haves"" with eerily similar phrasing across multiple posts.
* **""Upgrades"" framed as essential.** Posts frequently suggest that without a niche $500 accessory, you might as well be drinking instant coffee.
* **The elitist gatekeeping.** The subtle (or not-so-subtle) message: if you aren‚Äôt spending thousands, you‚Äôre not a real espresso lover.
* **Negative reviews mysteriously absent.** Criticism of the latest hyped-up machine? Buried, downvoted, or dismissed by an army of ""enthusiasts.""

# The Bottom Line

So, what‚Äôs the takeaway from all of this? Simple: don‚Äôt believe the hype. The espresso industry is built on the idea that you need the latest and greatest equipment to make good coffee, but the truth is that great espresso comes down to skill, not gear. You don‚Äôt need a¬†1,000grinderora1,000*grinderora*50 tamper to make a great shot‚Äîyou just need practice, patience, and a healthy dose of skepticism.

The next time you find yourself scrolling through r/espresso, remember that not everything is as it seems. Behind the glossy photos and glowing reviews lies a well-oiled machine designed to sell you products you don‚Äôt need. So go ahead, enjoy your coffee‚Äîbut don‚Äôt let the manufacturers grind you down.",24,1738328521.0,espressocirclejerk,13,0.79,False

I order through LSH and Hallandale and have a decent backlog of medication. I stayed at 2mg for over a month before talking to my prescriber and beginning to very slowly work my way up.

The main issue I am having with my father is his hearing issue. He cant hear well. I also think his age is affecting his awareness a bit because I feel as though sometimes it isnt a hearing issue but a listening one. I will admit, my patience does run thin at times and I do snap with a ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already told you this 3 times‚Äù. I honestly feel bad when I do get impatient. I think other people get impatient with him too and I think he is starting to fall into depression lately because of it. 

Another issue is his diet. He doesn‚Äôt really eat well. He gets a lot of his daily caloric intake from beer. Has 2-4 48oz cups of coffee (with creamer) daily along with a pastry usually. He‚Äôll get a small burrito from a local restaurant sometimes too. He doesnt cook or really clean up his mess but I attribute that to how he was brought up and raised. He doesnt really drink water either. The color of his pee is dark and orange. He says his doctor has told him he needs to drink more water multiple times. This ends up with him drinking a bunch of water all at once for a while then he just stops altogether. 

I take him to his doctor‚Äôs appointments and feel as though he isnt completely honest with his doctor. I would like to share some of my concerns about my father‚Äôs health with his doctor. I just am unsure if it is inappropriate or unwarranted. Everytime I try and have a talk with him about it my father states that he is fine or that he is already set in his ways. Would stepping in, as his child, be difficult or rejected by doctors or medical offices?",1,1738327904.0,family,1,1.0,False

Micheal wasn‚Äôt much of an art critic. Or an artist, for that matter. By his recollection, the last time he‚Äôd held a wet paintbrush he‚Äôd been a teenager. But the painting he found himself looking at now had got to be the most captivating of any he‚Äôd seen up to this point. He‚Äôd seen prettier paintings, larger more ambitious pieces. He‚Äôd visited The Louvre once during his transition year trip to Paris, he remembered spying The Mona Lisa over the tops of tourists' heads. But never had he been more captivated by a piece of art.¬†

Micheal was stood less than a meter away from the hanging canvas, the art enveloped his whole field of view, and he felt as though he was a part of the piece itself. As though he could turn around, and find himself surrounded by patches of brushstrokes and more splashes of paint. Micheal took a few steps back and the strangest thing happened. As the piece shrank in his perspective, Micheal could actually make out even more of the detail on the canvas. He didn't have to squint his eyes to follow one set of fluid brushstrokes around the painting until they were interrupted by another set at a right angle. He followed those and could perceive the cragged ridges of each stroke, and the valleys between them. He couldn't remember being able to do that whilst he had been standing so close.¬†

Counterintuitive as it was, Micheal paced further away from the painting, never once taking his eyes off the artwork, he walked arse first into the bench at the centre of the large gallery, falling onto it with a thud, hurting his tailbone. He was more enthralled than ever with the painting. New details revealed themselves with each step in reverse. He saw the spots where the artist had clumsily messed up their brushing. Spots where the paint had been applied too enthusiastically and ran, yet clung to the canvas. He saw where the canvas had split and frayed, its painted tentacles reaching out from the canvas as if inviting him in. He felt he understood the painting better now.¬† Micheal had never felt as though he had understood a painting before.¬†

He was far enough away now that people were walking between him and the painting, interrupting his sightline. This didn't bother Micheal though, he noticed as each silhouette crossed into his eye line, that they too blended into the artwork seamlessly. He could make out the crow's feet around their eyes, or their peeling, chapped lips, as easily as he could the details of the painting. He wasn‚Äôt even upset when a group of Spanish students, numbering fifteen of sixteen, crowded the space between him and the painting. The figures crossed the painting, one after another, as the moon crosses the sun during an eclipse. They passed, and the details of their faces faded into Micheal‚Äôs peripheral vision, and the focus was again on the exquisite, artwork. He sat there for hours studying the painting, committing every inch of it to memory, and studying the people too.

The next day, on his way home from the office, Micheal took a detour to the gallery to see the painting. He bought a coffee and an almond croissant from the cafe in the foyer and brought them into the hall containing his painting. Ignoring the bench at the centre of the hall, where he had sat yesterday, Micheal walked to the far end of the hall, leaving as much space as possible between him and his painting, he set up camp between two far less interesting paintings, with his back against the wall. There he stood, sipping his cooling coffee, eating his almond croissant, and studying his painting. From this far away Micheal could clearly see the cracks between the separate flecks of paint. He was overcome, for the entirety of the hours that he stood there, with an overwhelming feeling of regret, that to properly see the painting, he had to be so far away. How unfair it was that such an intricate thing could only be comprehended from such a distance. He felt a profound jealousy of every person who walked between him and the painting (at this distance there were many). How envious he was of each of them, as they crossed the space between and were in turn, welcomed into the painting‚Äôs world. Spotlighted by it. Though they had no idea. But Micheal made no move to close the distance. He knew that with every step closer to the painting, detail would be lost, it would become blurry as it grew in his perspective, and envelope him, and the intricacy, where the true beauty of the painting lay, would be lost to him. This routine became a daily ritual for Micheal, and he grew fat on almond croissants.

One day, Micheal walked into the hall where his painting hung, to find another one in its place. He reacted badly, tears welling in his eyes, and a tight knot twisting and turning in his stomach, he thought he was going to shit himself. Upon calming himself, which took a while, he found the nearest attendant and asked about the painting.¬†

‚ÄúWhich painting?‚Äù she responded with disinterest. ‚ÄúOh it was in here? Well everything in here‚Äôs been sent back, t‚Äôwas all part of the same exhibition. On loan. Sure there was a big sign‚Äù.¬†

She pointed to where the big sign had, presumably, once stood.¬†

The twisting knot in Michael's stomach returned. He felt as though he‚Äôd been forced out of his own home. Walking around the hall with nerves, he glanced from canvas to canvas, he‚Äôd never seen any of them before, though he could honestly not recall any singular painting held within this gallery save for his own. Many of the other paintings were far more beautiful than his, there were large landscapes, contemporary abstract pieces, portraits. Most were more technically impressive, may even have had more artistic merit, though none had that supernatural quality of his own. The closer he got to every, single painting, the more details could be distinguished, the further away he got, the more those details were lost until the canvas was hardly a speck on the porcelain white walls of the gallery.¬†

In a panic, he approached the ticket desk in the foyer.¬†

‚ÄúExcuse me, the exhibition in the large hall has ended, the paintings have all been returned‚Äù.

The woman operating the ticket desk looked at him amused. ‚ÄúYes. They have‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúTo where?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

Frantically he asked again. ‚ÄúTo where have the paintings been returned?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo Denmark, the paintings have all been returned to Copenhagen.‚Äù She paused. ‚ÄúIn Denmark‚Äù.¬†

Micheal was on a train to Copenhagen. He had landed at Copenhagen Kastrup Airport, 45 minutes ago and was presently watching the sun rise through the window, on his way into the city. He squinted into the distance, attempting to make out the details on the horizon. A combination of the morning haze and the staccato movement of the train made this very difficult. He was as much a part of this world now, as he had been a part of the paintings the first and only time he had stood so close. The last thing he had eaten had been an almond croissant almost four hours ago,¬† prior to boarding his flight, and he was famished. He didn't mind too much though, it would all be worth it when he saw his painting.¬†

An hour of googling mapsing later, he had found his way to the gallery. An impressive classical building. Micheal walked beneath the high archway, flanked by two gorgeous Romanesque pillars. He registered none of it as he entered the grand entrance hall and purchased for himself a ticket to the gallery's newest installation. Vibrating with excitement, and shaking from hunger, he navigated the spacious halls of the Danish art gallery, painting after painting span by as he locked in on his destination and kicked into a light jog, end nearly in sight, he rounded the last corner.¬†

There it was. Given no more a place of pride than any other of the hundreds of paintings in this cavernous rectangular hall. His painting. It was mounted, two in from the left, on a scarlet wall at the far end of the hall. Immediately he noticed the familiar curves of the brushstrokes as they wound their way around the canvas, merging into larger masses, which gave rise to shapes, which in turn formed the subject of the image. He zoomed in further and noticed some mistakes covered up by the artist lying just beneath the surface of the painting, shielded from a less sharp eye by the layers of paint applied above. He had never noticed that before. He had never been this far away.

It was then that Micheal was able to place himself within the geography of the room. It was a large rectangular hall, two almost impossibly long walls facing one another, garnished with artwork. At the end of each wall, a smaller square wall connected them, it was on one of these walls that Micheal's painting hung. He immediately understood. With the same energy with which he had flown to Denmark, located the Gallery, and his painting within it, Micheal ran to the far wall. A wild grin on his face, he slammed his back against it, he could not have been any further away from his painting. Micheal took a deep breath, steadied himself against the wall, and looked.",2,1738327732.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1ieduo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1ieduo0/i_just_needed_to_vent_a_little_bit/,I just needed to vent a little bit,"Hi there guys, this might be a little long, ill try to do my best. 

Since the very beginning of my youth i've always had a very disfunctional relationship with sex. My first sex encounters were very late ( 20s) and sloppy, due to having a slight phimosis and not knowing it. Also i had underlaying depression that combined with intensive porn consumption led to having severe problems getting it hard with my first girlfriend. 

It wast until 2013, being in my 30s, that i heard from NoFap and the deep damage that porn and compulsive masturbation can do to your psique and your sex drive.  I attempted several times to quit through the years but failed miserably. I want to point out here that i've dipped in all kinds of drug use over the span of the last 20 years and had no problem quitting them. Im talking about coke, weed, ketamine, LSD, shrooms, GHB, you name it.  Its funny, cause i've seen several trainwrecks and severe cases of drug addiction and mental conditions among the people that i met in those contexts, yet i never had any problems stopping  or suffered from any remaining side effects. I feel perfectly fine in that regard and no longer use drugs. I also quit coffee, i was a very heavy consumer, and withdrawal was hell, almost unbearable insomnia for two weeks and a half. Still in the process of stopping drinking alcohol totally, but this will take more time, cause here in Spain, its extremelly normalized.

Now, on the other hand, i've been unable to quit porn for good an all. To me, is just a whole different league. Its over available, its free, is a very primitive urge, its instant pleasure, you know how fucked up it is. 

And this has led to 20 years of on and off PIED, but more recently, and unfortunatly, i has led me to develop HF. 

The funny and very sad thing is, that even though im fat and not very good looking (although i do have a nice face), i've had a lot of success getting attracting women. My friends always say that i have a lot of game, that im a natural. Which makes this whole situation a whole of a lot harder to deal with. 

Thing is, three months ago, i was in the verge of getting laid with a very strong crush that i had in my job. Probably the biggest crush i have ever had. But when i was almost going to get a date with her, some fucked up shit happened. Due to some traumatic event that i lived while using drugs, i lost a lot of confidence and self-steem and inevitably lost her as well in the process. This resulted in severe depression, feeling of despair, very intense suicidal ideation etc. It goes without saying that i overfapped in order to deal with this, specially during nights of endless insomnia. And i think that all of the stress, the extreme sadness and feeling of being unworthy, and the compulsive masturbation, all of this ended up creating the conditions for HF to appear. Im in bad shape as well, which doesn't help. 

In any case, this is were i am now. Last months have been like living hell to me, the only thing i wanted to do is dying, i've had acute anhedonia, i no longer enjoy the things that i used to, (watching shows or movies do no longer have any appeal for me), and have been battling with suicidal thoughts everyday. Yet i decided that i'll never take my life away cause that would devastate my family, and i would never do something like that to my mother. 

I feel worthless, and avoid women. This is a terrible state to be in, and frankly, having looked at the eyes of love, having had heaven so close, makes this way way worse. 

I will do whatever it takes to get over this but frankly, i think that accepting the state you are in, the possibility of failure, is almost a necessity. Cause if you dont, its very feasible that i will end obsessing over this. 

In any case, i feel absolutely lost  and worthless as a human being. I hate myself. I see everyone getting on with their lives and i feel stuck. 

Never have i felt myself more further way from happiness than now.  I used to be funny, but i have to accept that maybe i will never return to fully be my former self. I'll get better and evolve, but i feel semi-traumatized by this. Not being able to be loved by a woman, feels like im not satisfying a very natural and necessary purpose. 

This sucks

1iedqch,https://www.reddit.com/r/OveractiveBladder/comments/1iedqch/i_think_my_brain_is_playing_with_me_solutions/,I think my brain is playing with me - solutions?,"Hello,

I have quite a specific issue with OAB. I've read through quite a lot of posts on this subreddit from which I understood that most people have constant urges or even incontinencies. I really hope you guys find a way to relieve yourselves from your issues, yet I'd like to ask if anyone is having similar problems as I do or even better, has any solution. I experience OAB in a form of intense outbursts of urge to pee in inappropriate places or situations only.

I have a job in the office where I basically sit at my laptop for several hours. I also study university. My schedule is very tight, I often work long hours, switch to school stuff straight from work etc. so coffee is quite a nice solution to get through the day. 4-5 cups of coffee is no big deal for me. Naturally this is the first thing I should probably focus on when thinking about getting rid of OAB. But here's the catch. I believe I can quite clearly distinguish between having a feeling of a full bladder and having an URGE to pee. And when I say urge I really mean that at that moment I feel like if I don't seek the toilet immediately, I'll jump out of my skin. I don't have problems with incontinence. But at that moment, nothing helps - even inducing pain. And here comes the messiest part. I get this urge only when I'd prefer not to go because it's inappropriate or just annoying. So I don't wake up during night. I even tried to not go to the toilet before bed and although it wasn't exactly pleasant, I just woke up in the morning with a more full bladder than usual. If I'm working in the office (9-18), I go to the toilet two to four times at max (based on fluid intake). But when I leave the office or travel somewhere in general, you can bet that I'll get this urge. I think it's like 50:50 chance. What I'm even more perplexed by is that sometimes when I arrive at the destination and I sort of forget about it (idk, I come home and go to greet my cat), I'm able to go on with the day like as if nothing happened and will go to toilet like an hour to three later not because of the urge but because of a natural feel of having a full bladder. Yesterday I had an exam at the uni, I was chatting with my classmates for about 40 minutes before the professor called my name. I come to his office, sit down and he begins this quite boring monologue about the topic of my thesis. Well guess what. But then I came out of his office, went to have a word with my classmates again and... the urge was gone.

And yesterday I've had 2 coffees only (both prior to the exam though). To me it seems as if my brain is just fucking around with me. When I'm occupied with something else and I'm really focused on it, everything is fine. The moment my brain gets a chance to feel bored - BAM. One could even say that I'm doing this to myself unconsciously.

Is anyone else experiencing this? Any ideas how to handle this? I've seen the TENS machines being discussed here, do you think it might help in this case? Thank you in advance.",2,1738326717.0,OveractiveBladder,0,1.0,False

1iednkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckeryUniveristy/comments/1iednkb/good_men/,Good Men,"I met one of the most memorable men I ever would quite by accident.  Cold winter night, tracings of snow on the ground.  A small town in Missouri bisected by a secondary route connecting two interstates. Just passing through. Tired from the road, I was, and hungry.  

An all night Denny‚Äôs just off the road.  Just the place to rest for a while and get something hot to eat.  Take some of the lonely road-weary miles off of my shoulders for a little while.  

He was sitting on a banquet when I walked in.  Police uniform. Badge and name tag on the open leather jacket he wore.  Himself nondescript. Watching the people in the place in a casual way that I sensed missed nothing at all. 

Without a glance at me, casually; ‚ÄúHave a seat.‚Äù  It wasn‚Äôt a request.  Intrigued, I sat down beside him. 

‚ÄúSaw your plates.  Texas, hunh?  You‚Äôre a long way from home.‚Äù  Looked like he didn‚Äôt miss much. Still hadn‚Äôt looked at me. 

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere you comin‚Äô from?‚Äù 

I got it. I might have wondered myself.  I knew how bad what I looked like.  Hair a bit too long, and not too kempt.  Beard just starting to show some gray. 
Clothes that showed I didn‚Äôt care how I looked.  Rough, maybe a little suspicious. 

I was used to people assuming by my appearance and demeanor that I was rougher than I was.  Maybe to be avoided. Maybe trouble. And in a small town in Missouri, it would be his interest to feel me out and determine if I might be. It was his town. What was I here for?

I‚Äôd used to be.  There was a time when I sought out that very thing, trouble, but that was in the past now. No more trying to find it. No more things I never should have done.  No more fighting other men just for the sake of it.  Taking pleasure in administering a little pain, and just as much in receiving some myself.  Trying to quench the anger that it had taken me a long time to better understand the sources of. 

In the past now, and maybe some day I might begin to better understand it all.  Forgive myself for some things that had to be kept out of the light.  Maybe he‚Äôd seen that in my face. Maybe he thought that was still who I was. Can the past cling to you in a way that someone who knows how to can see? Who knows? I knew I wasn‚Äôt what most would consider a good man. I didn‚Äôt.  Hadn‚Äôt been, anyway. 

But that wasn‚Äôt who I was anymore, was it?  I had a family now.  A wife who knew what and who I had been and who I was, and accepted it all, loving me without constraint despite it all. 

She‚Äôd come along at a time I‚Äôd stopped caring about much of anything at all.  Saved me in more ways than she‚Äôd ever know.  

So I told him, and at his asking told him why I‚Äôd been there.  

Now he Did look at me, and his manner eased.  The blank face gone, and something more casual in its look.  I guess I‚Äôd passed muster. Professional curiosity satisfied.  

‚ÄúMan, that‚Äôs tough. Stuff like that really pisses me off.‚Äù  And I could tell he meant it. 

‚ÄúEvening, Chief!‚Äù A youngish couple who‚Äôd just entered smiling and nodding in greeting as they walked past.  They liked him.  

‚ÄúAngie, Bradley, good to see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me for a minute‚Äù, and he rose and approached a table at which a group of young men had been getting too loud and raucous.  Spoke to them in a friendly manner that nevertheless left no room for argument.  They listened and nodded respectfully. 

Then he came back and sat back down:  

‚ÄúI like to keep an eye on things, this time of night, after the bars let out.  This is a favorite stopping place, after, and some can get a little rowdy sometimes.  Frees my men up for more important things.  Hell, gets me out of the office, lol.  I like to keep odd hours.  Nothin‚Äô to go home to.‚Äù

Not complaining, he was.  Just stating simple fact. Lonely men just like to talk sometimes.  I once had been one myself.  

‚ÄúYou married?‚Äù he asked, interested.  I‚Äôd been retired for just a few years by then.  Had lost the habit of wearing my ring long ago, after an injury barely missed when it had gotten caught on something. This guy didn‚Äôt miss much. 

‚ÄúI am.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood woman?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe best.‚Äù

‚ÄúHang onto her, then.  Don‚Äôt never let go‚Ä¶..I was.  Second wife. First didn‚Äôt work out.  Just too different, I guess.  We still get along all right, though. Got a son between us, grown‚Ä¶‚Ä¶But Melinda‚Ä¶..‚Äù

And the smile of fond memory transformed his un handsome face.  

‚ÄúShe was really somethin‚Äô.  Prettiest woman I‚Äôd ever seen.  One ‚Äòo them dating sites.  Son talked me into it, few years after his mother an‚Äô me split.  
Felt like a damn fool, but figured why not?  We decided to meet for coffee.  Maybe get to know each other a littie bit.

I tell you, when I walked in that place and saw her, I came close to turnin‚Äô around and walkin‚Äô back out again.  Picture hadn‚Äôt done her justice.  

Bob, Lucinda‚Äù, to another couple, who‚Äôd nodded at him in passing.

‚ÄúI could see she was too good for Me.  But she‚Äôd seen me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶That smile‚Ä¶.‚Äù

And again his eyes lit up at a treasured memory. 

‚ÄúWe had three good years together, before cancer took her.‚Äù  Sadness and loneliness coming through in his voice now.  

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAppreciate it, but no need.  They were Good years.  Still don‚Äôt know what she saw in me, but I wasn‚Äôt complaining.‚Äù

I saw what she had, even if he didn‚Äôt.  His easy confidence and competent bearing. The obvious esteem in which he was held by the people it was his duty to protect.  I figured they were in good hands.  Humble, honest men often don‚Äôt recognize their own value. 

We talked for a while longer about other things.  Found that we had some things in common.  He‚Äôd served in the Marine Corps, as I had.  Had been a volunteer fireman, which had been my own second profession. 

Eventually it was time for him to leave:

‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôll drive around a while.  See things are quiet.‚Äù

They were. No calls had been alerted, in the time we‚Äôd been talking, over the net. But some men are always on the job.  It‚Äôs who they are, and they take their responsibilities seriously.  

He rose and I rose with him.

‚ÄúBeen a pleasure‚Äù he said, and extended his hand.  

‚ÄúSame.‚Äù

‚ÄúDrive careful, now.  Might be a little ice in places.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do that.‚Äù

I found a booth, and ordered something to eat.  Took my time, and then got back on the road.  And as I drove, thought about the strange unexpected encounter with a good man it would have been a pleasure to have gotten to know, in other circumstances. 

A lonely man who had been willing to talk to another who‚Äôd been willing to listen.  Who was still in love with a woman who was gone, and probably would always be. 

On a cold night in Missouri, in the winter of the year.  

You meet people sometimes, when you least expect it, who leave a strong impression on you out of proportion to the brief time you spend in their company. 

I later stopped for a break just over the Texas line.  And got a call from an old friend.  Smiled as I listened to him curse after he‚Äôd asked how far I‚Äôd made it:  ‚ÄúDamn it, OP!  I Told you not to drive straight through!  You‚Äôre not as young as you used to be!‚Äù

Remembering the folded bills he‚Äôd stuffed into my shirt pocket when I‚Äôd met him in the City.  After I‚Äôd arrived there to attend to what I needed to:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need -‚Äú

‚ÄúShut the hell up.  The gas you spent on the road didn‚Äôt come cheap.  And if I find out you needed anything else while you were here and didn‚Äôt come to me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.so help me, OP!‚Äù

The conversation coming to an end now, as I sat on a picnic table:

‚ÄúYou give that dear wife of yours a hug for me, OP.   She‚Äôs too good for you, but you know that.  And you‚Äôd better treat her right.  I find out you aren‚Äôt ‚Ä¶. I might be dying, but I‚Äôll still get on a plane and come down there and kick your ass.‚Äù

I‚Äôd smiled through the tears that wanted to fall after he‚Äôd hung up.  He‚Äôd probably try to.  He didn‚Äôt have much time left, and we both knew it.  A week or two at most, his doctors had told him.  Maybe just days. Any time at all.  The cancer he‚Äôd fought for the last two years had finally won.  And I understood. He‚Äôd called to say goodbye.  In the gruff way that was the only way he knew.  But love shines through regardless.  

It was only when I read his obituary that I learned how highly he‚Äôd been decorated for valor on two separate occasions during the war he‚Äôd fought.  In all the years I‚Äôd known him he‚Äôd never mentioned those once.  Only that he‚Äôd been there, and it hadn‚Äôt been a good place.  

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just smoke to get your fix?‚Äù I‚Äôd once asked him, as he‚Äôd dug into a pouch of chewing tobacco.  

‚ÄúHabit I picked up.  Couldn‚Äôt smoke on the front lines at night.  Bastards‚Äôd see it from miles away and know exactly where you were.‚Äù

I‚Äôd met and known many good men like him and the one in Missouri. And I‚Äôd lost and was losing too many of them. Time destroys us all.  

I wiped my eyes and got back on the road.  Momma was waiting, and it‚Äôd be good to see her again.  And I owed her that last hug from him. There wouldn‚Äôt be any more. 

Unless he got on that plane, lol.  He was stubborn enough to try.  People might try to stop him. And might not be successful. No one ever had. ",10,1738326461.0,FuckeryUniveristy,0,0.92,False

(TW: Suicide),"Me (20M) and my fianc√© (21M) are long distance and every summer he comes to my home town to stay with me for a bit. 

Last summer when he was down I got some messages from my best friend - for context my best friend suffers from bipolar disorder and had recently at this time tried to kill herself. The messages I received from her were aimed at my fianc√© asking why he forces me to stay inside and why do I go all quiet when he‚Äôs around. The actual answer to this is that I go quiet and don‚Äôt hang out with others as much because I rarely get to see him, we spend our days hanging out, watching films,etc. He didn‚Äôt see these messages at first as I was at work, so in order to sort it out I met her for a coffee after. After we spoke about it she stated that she didn‚Äôt mean to sound so accusing but she was worried that my mental health was getting bad and I didn‚Äôt want to see anyone. She then apologised loads for how she had acted, I forgave her as she had only got out of hospital days prior after her attempt. She was struggling so I understood that she may be jumping to conclusions about things and acting out of character - this is something I got used to in our 10 years of friendship. 

When I got home I told my fianc√© what had happened and he asked to see the messages, I obliged as it was all sorted and wasn‚Äôt going to hide anything. He understandably got very upset over the accusations and I explained the whole conversation I had with her afterwards. He got extremely moody and wouldn‚Äôt talk to me for hours. 

Every time her name is brought up he makes a snide comment but he won‚Äôt talk to her about it or anything. I don‚Äôt want to bring it up to my friend now as it was a really horrible time in her life and she regrets a lot of that summer. Recently my friend has been planning her wedding so I asked my fianc√© if he would be my plus one, to which he said he hates my best friend so no he won‚Äôt come, then instantly getting into a bad mood and ignoring me. Im so lost and tired, I don‚Äôt know what else to do but I can‚Äôt live with my fianc√© hating my best friend. Advice? ",1,1738326449.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

I‚Äôm going to get a flat in London and can‚Äôt decide how important a balcony is for me and whether I‚Äôm romanticising  the idea of one. 

Pros:
- I like the idea of a little outdoor space with a bench to get some ‚Äòfresh‚Äô air. Waking up on weekends and having a coffee outdoors.
-Grow some outdoor plants and herbs and add some character to the flat. 


Cons:
- It‚Äôs London and a bigger priority is for me to live near a tube station. I know it‚Äôs not for everyone but I want a 1 minute walk to transport. Lots of flats are being build near stations. This will mean the outdoor space will be noisy and maybe not worth it
- it‚Äôs unlikely I‚Äôll get a view anyway, with so many high rises being so close together 
- It may add to the price, and I could get a larger flat without a balcony.

I never knew why, until I started suspecting ADHD (in my 30s) and saw all those very relatable memes about forgetting to eat and not realising you're hungry until your legs start to shake...

I've managed to keep it somewhat under control during periods of time when I've had the energy to ensure that I eat plenty of whole grain and have regular meals, but honestly, that's the exception more than the norm (i.e. cooking hyperfixations).

And now that I've started stimulants, it feels like it's gotten worse, like my blood sugar is completely out whack from the second I have my breakfast and meds (esp if I have coffee, so trying to cut that out).

Does anyone have similar problems? I know that the solution is obviously a healthy diet, but as we all know, that is a great struggle with an ADHD brain - so what do you do when the energy just isn't there for three homecooked broccoli based meals a day, but you also need to not be shaking all day?",3,1738325823.0,adhdwomen,6,1.0,False

However, now I regret it because I feel guilty.

The first guy and I have been on four dates and at the end of the 3rd and 4th date we had some sexual stuff, and he seems very interested in me. He‚Äôs taken me on nice dates, bought me flowers on the second date, and even gifted me a bracelet on the fourth. I like him, but I have some doubts. He doesn‚Äôt talk much about his friends, which makes me think he might be unsocial, though he once mentioned that he likes how social I am. He also compliments me a lot, but sometimes it feels exaggerated, and I worry he might be love bombing me. Another small thing that while i was drinking coffee he told me he had never tried cappuccino or latte, which I found a bit odd. Despite these doubts, I do feel attracted to him, and we have a strong sexual tension.

Since we hadn‚Äôt discussed exclusivity, I went on a date with another guy after my third date with the first one. The second guy is also attractive and seems more social, which I find appealing. Our conversation flowed better, and on our second date, he kissed me and invited me over. I initially declined, but he promised we would just cuddle, so I ended up going with him. We only cuddled and kissed with our clothes on, and I actually enjoyed the intimacy. However, he broke up with his long-term girlfriend just five months ago, and I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs over her.

A sprayer (assumedly for pesticide) has been left on the median in front of 1820 Richmond Road. It's 3/4 full of a pinkish liquid, very likely a herbicide. It's been there for at least two weeks now, I've noticed it before, and it hasn't moved. Hopefully nobody tries to mess with it, I'd be worried some kid tries to find out what's in it.

When my Nmom left the hospital room, my dad thanked me for coming out to make sure she wasn‚Äôt mean to him. It was really really heartbreaking.

I suspect she is bipolar or similar, her mood is unpredictable. She‚Äôs been very manic the last few days and I‚Äôm about at my wit‚Äôs end. Every 15 minutes or so, reminding me she exists and what nice thing she did or got at the store (yogurt, coffee). My dad was in clear agony in the hospital room and she decided to use that time to read the entire 6 page info sheet about after care for his surgery to him. Like, she can‚Äôt read the room or have empathy. 

I used to avoid my family entirely because anytime I give my nmom or nsister an inch they take a mile. Despite being here now, allowing her to visit in April AND agreeing to Thanksgiving together, it isn‚Äôt enough, and while she had me 1;1 in the hospital cafeteria she told me I am coming home for Christmas and all of these other travel ideas she had that I wouldn‚Äôt feign excitement for and it upset her. Like, her and my sister decided these things on the phone without asking me. Never mind that I‚Äôve made plans with my sister for things and she üíØ ghosts me on them. And I am here. Now. Just spend time with me instead of planning for the next one?

Like‚Ä¶. I am 35 years old, LOL. I am so homesick and feel like a child. 4 more days and then I am safely back, across the country. ",1,1738325570.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

Here are a few details:

The living room is 14' wide x 20' long, located off the kitchen. There's a lot of natural light with large windows overlooking the lake. The patio door leads to the deck. There's a separate formal dining room elsewhere. We'd like to remove the carpet and replace with LVP. We like the idea of building a coffee/wine nook.

We're aiming for a modern look with a cabin/lake vibe. Must be family friendly as we have little children.

We're open to spending a few thousand dollars on remodeling, furniture, and decorations.

Thanks all for your input!!",2,1738325525.0,interiordesignideas,10,1.0,False
