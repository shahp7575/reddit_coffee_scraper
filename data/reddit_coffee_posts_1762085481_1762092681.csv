I get happy looking at him. Just looking. I'll scroll through pictures of him for half an hour just to see him and smile. The other day I almost cried because he was eating pizza, specifically because it was the slice he picked out for himself and idk. Aaah. We make each other coffee and we just sit there together and I just want to cry. I love him so much. Hes at work right now and I'm literally tearing up  thinking about him flipping his lil burgers ohh.....

I cant wait to spend the rest of my life with him. Hes saving for a ring and I've told him I just need something from Walmart but he thinks I ""deserve the best"" like? Brother get the walmart ring I want to be hitched!!!! I want him to be a father and I want to raise our kids together and I want to grow old sitting on the patio watching birds and listening to his heartbeat at night. I want to share coffee in the morning and come home from work to his face because I know with him I'm always safe, I'm always loved and I'm always happy and that's all I want for him too. 

Of course there's ups and downs but even the low moments i think, ""it's gonna be okay later and we can fall asleep tonight okay"" because that's what we do, he never lets us go to bed angry even when I want to, he works it out when I'm too stubborn and he's there. Hes just fucking there! Being himself! And that's just great!!!!! That's just the greatest thing in the world because it's him and Jesus Christ I'm crying right now. I love him. I love him I love him i love him. ",1,1762092558.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1omi3s7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1omi3s7/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #001 ""The bus to Nowhere""","My name is Elijah Wiltburrow. I've been advised that I'll need to redact certain things from this statement, not that many of you would believe a lot of this. I don't mean to insult you all, but most people don't seem to take anything paranormal with more than a grain of salt, maybe at most something to believe in for the thrill of believing that something is out there. Well, there is.

At the time of this story, I had been newly hired by an organisation that specialises in the study of the paranormal. I can't say the name of the organisation for obvious reasons, but I was drawn to it for two very important reasons.

The first reason is that I have always been drawn to the paranormal. Growing up, I was fascinated with ghost stories and read all I could on the subject. This later blossomed into me studying parapsychology, which leads me to my second reason for joining this organisation. It is very difficult to get a job when you're primarily a scholar of a defunct field of study. ""Debunked"" isn't technically the word I'd use.

It's real. I knew it at the time, and I sure as hell know it now, but that's not the point of this statement.

My friend and fellow field research operative, Lily Heinz, had accompanied me on my first job assignment. Now, Lily Heinz is a psychic. I think this is important to clarify now before we continue.

She had an episode a few months prior to this case and was “scouted” by the organisation. I use those quotation marks because it was really an ultimatum: work for them or… well, I think you can fill in the rest.

She hadn't been a particularly powerful psychic in the time I had known her, but she was aware enough to sense when some paranormal energy was around. A helpful tool in our line of work.

Now this was my first case of my career, and I didn't really know what to expect. I mean, when you are told that there is a likely paranormal bus picking people up in the middle of the night, well, it kind of kicks any expectations out of your head.

We sat inside of Lily's car; the cold night air was thick, and a fitting, almost comical fog had swept in a few hours previously. Her car's heater had died a few weeks previously, so we both sat in an awkward silence wearing our heavy puffer jackets, struggling to stay awake.

We were parked on the side of one of the few roads entering the small mining town of \[REDACTED\], the street itself wasn't anything special, just a gravel road and high trees.

A few hundred feet down from us was a single street lamp with a bus sign hanging off it; the lamp was off. We both watched the street lamp with unwavering concentration; the dossier I was given for this case had explained that from the hours of 11 pm to 4:35 am a mystery bus would come and pick up hitchhikers.

And so here we are, waiting at 1 am for a bus or something to show up. I remember feeling a certain excitement from all of this; I'm pretty sure it's the only thing that kept me awake. Lily was less enthused. This was our second night surveying the site, and last night we hadn't gotten anything. She was quick to say that this was likely just another local legend that we could log as a ""myth"" in the paperwork, but the rules are the rules, we have to survey a site for at least two weeks if the paranormal entity or object doesn't abide by time regulations.

""Looks like we have someone,"" she said. Her words broke my concentration on the street lamp, and I raised the camera I had with me and zoomed in on the figure. It was a woman wearing a heavy jumper and what looked like a backpack. A runaway, maybe?

As she got closer to the street lamp, I looked at lily, she winced her eyes and looked at me.

""There is definitely something here, Elijah,"" she said with tension.

""How can you tell?"" I asked, but as I said this, the street lamp suddenly lit alight, the bus sign illuminated, and a small bench that I hadn't seen in the dark sat underneath it.

""Shit,"" I blurted out before I grabbed the door handle, but she grabbed my shoulder and held me back.

""We have to watch, this is our job, rookie,"" Lily said to me sternly.

The woman cautiously walked up to the bench and took a seat. She sat there for a few minutes, and we watched, took photos and notes, all protocol. After at most five minutes, I heard an engine coming from behind us. I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw two bright lights approaching from the distance.

An old transit bus pulled up, and the women and the sign were obscured from view. I took some photos, and Lily looked like she was concentrating on something; she had her eyes closed and hand slightly outstretched towards the bus. After a minute, the bus's engines came back to life and drove away, and the street lamp turned off. Lily pressed her foot down, and the car began to wheel out off the side of the road and follow the bus, but after five or so minutes, the bus was gone. It didn't vanish like a ghost or melt away; it just simply disappeared.

She got out of the car and grabbed something out of the trunk, then she walked towards the side of the road and stabbed something into the dirt; it was a GPS pin. a portable tracker that, when turned off, left a pin on your GPS, helpful for when you're tracking things in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night.





We drove back to \[REDACTED\] and stayed in an old motel. It was just before 2 in the morning when I dropped like a tonne of bricks onto the bed. I drifted to bed immediately and awoke to the sound of knocking on the motel room door. I shot up and walked over to the window, looking out onto the walkway outside the door, and saw Lily standing there in a pair of jeans, a black button-up and her red hair tied back into a ponytail.

I looked at the alarm clock next to my bed, and it read 10.

""Shit!"" I remember saying before I opened the door. Lily looked at me and smiled.

""The best thing about working cases at night is that you can sleep like hell through the day. Enjoy it; soon you won't be able to sleep much at all,"" she said before placing a cup of coffee in my hand. I didn't even realise she was holding one. I took a sip and let the warm, beautiful sensation of coffee flood my empty stomach.

""You smoke?"" she asked while holding a box of cigarettes in her offhand.

""Ehh, no,"" I said awkwardly, and she shrugged before lighting one up.

She looked at me inquisitively. She leaned back on the table that sat opposite the end of my bed, and I sat on the bed, coffee in one hand and my head in the other.

""So what did we see last night?"" she asked.

I looked at her confused.

""The… bus?"" I said, genuinely confused, which made her sigh.

""Yes, the bus. What do you think it was?"" she said. I got the impression that she wasn't asking and that this was a test, and so I focused on what I had learnt leading up to this. Even before I was hired by the organisation, I had studied stuff like this for years.

""Well, the bus itself is clearly odd, it doesn't show up on any transport schedule or follow any routine, and yet it knew when that woman was there. It must be parked nearby or—"" My concentration broke. ""Shit, that woman. Has there been any news of her?"" I asked.

""Yes and no. Betty James was reported missing a few hours ago, and from what it looks like, she was running away from home, just like the others,"" she said before taking another swig of her smoke.

""Plus, the rate of people running away is significantly higher here than anywhere else in the surrounding areas, probably related, but I'm not sure how,"" she continued.

""And are we sure this thing is paranormal? Maybe it's just a coincidence."" I felt stupid for asking.

""Rookie, trust me, this is definitely paranormal. I got a feeling."" That feeling she got was what I'd later learn was her own paranormal awareness.

""Ok, so what's our next move? We can't keep watching, we know next to nothing about this thing,"" I said.

""I agree, we need eyes on this thing,"" she said with a malicious grin. The air in the shitty motel room suddenly grew thick as I realised what she was asking.

""You must be joking; I can't go on that thing. We don't even know where it goes.""

""You're right, we don't know dick besides where it disappears and what times it appears. Don't worry, I'm not sending you alone, I'll be coming with,"" she said and threw the smoke bud into the drain of the sink in the small kitchen.

""Till then, write down your notes and statement on last night's events, and try to rest up for tonight,"" she said whilst walking out of the room. She gave me a mischievous look when I realised that she gave me coffee when I definitely don't need the caffeine. Say what you will about Lily and her ""arrangement"" with the organisation, but she definitely knew how to make a joke in any situation.





After a day of tossing and turning, trying and failing to fall asleep, I eventually had to get up and get ready for work. It was 8 pm, and the night air was crisp. Lily drove us out to a diner on the edge of town, and I immediately ordered myself a black coffee.

""Didn't sleep well?"" Lily asked with a smile that said she was genuine but with a look that said she knew the answer.

""Surely I can report you for this,"" I said jokingly, although a part of me was genuinely interested in following this up. She laughed, and after a moment my coffee arrived. I took a sip, and Lily lifted a small backpack off the ground and onto the table.

I can't go into the specifics, of course, but imagine a ghost-hunting survival kit. The closest thing I can compare it to is shark hunting with a spear. Sure, you can harm the shark, but the chances of it harming you are still far too high once you're in its waters, and tonight we were diving right in.

A few hours later we pulled up to the side of the road across from the bus stop, the same spot as last night. We both got out, photographed the bus stop and walked over. The light for some reason didn't turn on when we approached, but we both had torches and a small wind-up lamp that had some power to it.

We waited for what felt like hours as we sat at the bus stop, and eventually, to what felt like our luck, the light lit up.

""Something is definitely here,"" Lily said, and as I looked at her, she held two fingers against her left eyebrow, as if there was tension there.

""Ehh, hello?"" A voice said from the left of us. I look over, and a young man, maybe 19, was standing there with a large bag and a puffer jacket. Shit, it wasn't waiting for anyone; it was waiting for people running away.

""Hey bud, how are you?"" I said in the friendliest tone I could, which I now realise would've been extremely unnerving considering the circumstances. I was only a few years older than this guy, and I tried to seem as natural as possible.

""I'm… good,"" the runaway said whilst still standing a few metres away.

""Elijah, heads up,"" Lily said silently after she placed a hand on my shoulder. I looked up at her, and she nodded her head towards the distance where two headlights shone towards us.

""So what brings you out of town? Going on a trip?"" I said as naturally as I could. Lily later told me that I weirded even her out.

""N-no… I just need to get out of this town, y'know,"" he said after a long moment.

The bus passed me and Lily and stopped directly in front of the runaway. This thing really had a target, but we both jogged over to the runaway and lined up behind him. The runaway was the first to enter, and after he stepped on, the door tried to shut but stopped midway through before slowly opening again, almost like it was reluctant to let us on.

We stepped up the steep metallic steps, and I tried to get a look at the bus driver, but from all I could see in the very dark bus was that he wore a typical bus driver uniform and sunglasses. He made no moves to greet or even acknowledge us. Lily was behind me, and after walking slowly down the aisle, I sat on the middle left-hand side of the bus, a few seats down from the runaway, and Lily sat across from me.

Besides our already established caution and scepticism, I felt like this place was really off. The bus was humid, and a sour smell hung in the air; it smelt almost like meat, but I couldn't place what animal.

The bus's engine came to life slowly, and it began to wheel down the lone country road towards \[REDACTED\].

""Elijah, stay focused; we need to take notes on what this thing is,"" Lily said before taking out her notebook and writing some notes. I reached into my bag and grabbed my camcorder.

The camcorder struggled to turn on. I now know that paranormal events and entities create a type of dead zone for technology or at the very least interfere with it greatly.

I was too distracted by the camcorder to realise that it was approaching until it grabbed hold of my shoulder. The bus driver held onto me, and I felt its fingers sink into me.

I looked up and saw its face staring down at me. Well, I looked at where its face should be; what was there was nothing. I need to stress that it wasn't flat like a smooth option; I mean, there was a hole where its face should be, and inside was a void.

""FUCK,"" I screamed. ""LILY,"" I continued, and as I looked at her, I realised she had her fingers on her forehead. She looked like she was in pain but was focused. I put my left hand on the bus driver's hand, trying to shift it off, and with my other hand I dig into my bag, looking for something.

I pulled out a small plastic bag filled with small white crystals. I opened the bag with my right hand and pushed it into the bus driver, which caused it to flinch back in pain and let go of my shoulder. Silver halide, or ""silver salt"", is like kryptonite to most paranormal creatures.

The creature made a hissing noise and fell back into a chair. I jumped out of the chair, and the adrenaline propelled me towards the driver's seat to try and pull the brakes, but it wouldn't budge.

I looked back towards the back half of the bus, and I noticed the hitchhiker; she was clearly dead. Her eyes were white and milky, and her skin was pale and thin.

""How did it get to him so quick?"" I thought, and I quickly looked back at the bus driver, and it stood up out of the chair and shrieked at me. It was next to Lily but completely ignored her, which meant I was in danger, real danger.

This was the moment that I realised what type of work I was in; it wasn't just going to sites and checking urban myths, it was standing in front of things that shouldn't exist and just trying to survive.

It leapt at me, and I shielded my arms out in front of me. I heard a metallic slam, and I opened my eyes to see it wriggling on the floor. I looked over at Lily and saw her hand outstretched towards the creature, and her eyes were rolled back.

""ELIJAH, USE THE RUNESTONE."" She yelled at me before throwing a cloth sack at me. I nodded my head and reached into the sack and grabbed a small stone pebble that had a rune etched into it. I had always been good with the study of languages, so when I saw the rune etched into the stone, I remembered what the intent was. I slammed it against the bus door and shouted “útlagr!”, an old Norse word meaning “banish”. When said with intent with this runestone, you can temporarily banish things not from our plane.

As I said this, my surroundings suddenly turned to mist, and I fell hard on some gravel. I had rolled for a few feet and was convinced that I had broken my shoulder; I held onto it and groaned. I looked around and saw Lily a few feet away.

""You okay?"" she asked. She held onto her ankle, and when I looked down at it, I realised that it must've twisted in an unnatural way.

""I'm fine. What the hell was that?"" I asked in between shallow breaths.

""A Lophiiformes-type entity. You're lucky; this was one hell of a first case, rookie,"" she said before laying back and breathing hard. What she did on the bus took a lot out of her, and she was close to passing out completely.





I called in to our higher-ups, and they dispatched some backup. A few hours before dawn, we had six people on the site surveying the bus stop. Before long, it was exorcised, and all that stands there now is a bus bench along an old country road.

I got chewed out for using a runestone. For those who don't know, runestones are incredibly rare; almost all of them can be traced back to an incredibly powerful witch in eighth-century Norway who created a couple thousand. How Lily was able to get her hands on one is beyond me, but without it, I'm convinced we'd be dead.

Lily got chewed out for putting us in that situation; her relationship with the organisation is different from mine. For them, I am an employee, but for her, it's a lot stricter. She wasn't fired and was allocated to the role of my partner indefinitely, which still stands today.

For those of you still reading, I thank you. You might be wondering why I am writing this and why I am interested in publicising some of my work if it means it would be censored. Simple. I think I am going to die. Something is hunting me, and it has for some time now, and as a scholar, I wish for some trace of my work to be out there.

Anywho, I advise all who are still reading to please stay away from any thoughts of suddenly wanting to run away in the middle of the night and to especially stay away from any bus stops on the edge of town. You may very well just be prey. ",1,1762092298.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1omi2os,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edgerunners/comments/1omi2os/mildly_hot_take_the_drawers_at_the_columbarium/,(Mildly Hot Take) The drawers at the columbarium aren't all set up by Lucy,"Hello there Chooms,

Today I present my observation (maybe some other people already made), concerning the north oak columbarium Easter egg. 

It is commonly accepted that Lucy made all edgerunner related deposits there. In case of Kiwi, Gloria, Rebecca and David that makes sense: The only two surviving edgerunners of the group are her and Falco, and especially for Kiwi, Gloria and David the epitaphs only makes sense if Lucy wrote them (Rebecca was arguably closer to Falco, but since she died on the rescue mission for Lucy, guilt could be a big motivation).

However, in case of Maine, Dorio and Pillar, this is less clear-cut. The epitath says that they have been the only family the person who wrote it has ever known. This could be Lucy at hyper trauma, yes.

It could also could have been Rebecca.

As it is known Rebecca was a late addition to the script, made not by CDPR, but by Studio Trigger, introduced by the infamous ultimatum ""The loli stays."". She doesn't have a role to play during the Maine-Incident, since that was most likely too tightly written from the start for late changes. However she has been around a lot longer them than Lucy or David, as we can see during the musicvideo for ""Let you down"". I think it's a waste to not give her a scene contemplating or talking about losing them, we only get a reference to Pillar.

Pillar is also a reason why I don't think that Lucy made that grave. Maine and Dorio as surrogate parents maybe, since her own original Family was really shitty, but Pillar the sex-pest? 

That her own parents sold her to Arasaka we know from the Cyberpunk red story pack, but there we also get the backstorys for Rebecca and Pillar. There they explain that Rebecca had been too caring and wild to be a really efficient Cyberpunk, despite her skills. In Pillar's background info we also learn that he asked Maine and Dorio to look out for her, because of her tendencies. 

Pillar is Rebecca's actual brother, so that kinda sidesteps his flaws as adopted family. Dorio and Maine had been around for more than a year, so sorrugate parents are a good possibility, especially since Rebecca and Pillar had been abandoned by their real parents.

So she very well could have made that drawer for the three of them.

My final piece of evidence is Julio. He also has a drawer at the columbarium. Lucy never met that guy, Falco and Kiwi most likely would not give a fuck, so that leaves David and Rebecca. David kept his mother's ashes on the coffee-table, so he most likely doesn't believe in graveyards and columbaria. Leaves Rebecca, who has been annoyed by the guy, but we know from the backstory and her general being, that she is a bleeding heart. 

Which means, a. The personal connection is there, for her to write the epitath and b. She does bury people at the columbarium. 

So in conclusion and tldr; The grave of Maine, Dorio and Pillar wasn't made by Lucy, but by Rebecca.",1,1762092215.0,Edgerunners,0,1.0,False

In the trailers we see them get into a scuffle at a bar, and if we go into the games episode selection menu, episode 5 has a still which shows said bar, so we know the bar scene happens here. I think Robert may have the option to come clean to the others about his past or not, but either way he then bumps into some of shrouds goons and a fight breaks out.

\-I think Z-team comes out on top of the fight, albeit battered and bruised. Included in this is that Flambae loses two of his fingers.

\- Somewhere in episode 5 we will have the option to get romantic with Visi or to keep things platonic. This one I'm unsure about but I also feel that it can't happen any later than episode 5, so it needs to be somewhere here.

  
Episode 6:

\- In the episode selection menu, we have a still of Robert laying on the floor of his apartment with a bottle of booze. There's a few ways one can read this, but my take is that he's depressed and I have an idea of how we get there:

\- In the trailers we have a scene where Robert is working out in a gym and Flambae comes to antogonize him. We see that Flambae is also missing two fingers. I think this is in the aftermath of the bar fight and Robert is trying to buff himself up, since he's still physically wasted from the time he spent in a coma.

\- We also have a trailers scene where Chase talks to Robert about the bar fight with shrouds goons, and I think here is where we start to lock in on the shroud storyline. Between dispatching shifts Robert begins brewing plans for how he'll make a move against shroud when his suit is fixed up

\- This will lead Visi to crack and come clean about her past connection with shroud, whatever it is. Robert will react badly to this and storm away.

\- Seeing this, Blazer will also speak to Robert. There's a scene in the trailers where she and him are talking by the billboard again, and she then floats upwards and looks into the distance with a concerned expression. Some people have speculated it's because there's an explosion or something happening, but my take is this is where she reveals her own past connection to shroud, and is unable to look at Robert when she does.

\- Robert will feel betrayed and overwhelmed, and will quit on the spot. This leads to him drinking on the floor of his apartment.

\- Another scene in the trailers shows Chase visiting Robert at his apartment, and I think it happens here. He'll come by to convince Robert to rejoin the team and stick things out. There's also a chance this isn't a set scene and we get visited by our romance option, with Chase being the backup if we kept things platonic.

\- This leads to all the revelations and team secrets being revealed by the end of episode 6, so that we can enter episode 7 and 8 with a clear, focused and unified goal to tackle shroud.

1omhz99,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1omhz99/the_piper_of_oakhaven/,The Piper of Oakhaven,"**Part I: The Harvest**



**October 28th.**



The fog arrived not merely as a weather event; it came as a wet, dense promise of something ancient and unseen.



Elara Crowley, at twenty-nine, hated Oakhaven. She had returned here after her mother’s death only to sell the house—a wooden box stuck between a graveyard and an endless cornfield. But for three weeks, she herself had been stuck, buried beneath probate papers and a creeping sense of November dread.



In this town, lost deep in the heart of New England, Halloween was not a carnival of plastic masks and candy. Here, it was called ""The Harvest Night,"" and the preparations were made with a frightening, almost religious solemnity.



Elara stood by the kitchen window, sipping her cold coffee. It was five in the evening, but the fog and the low, leaden clouds had plunged the outside into a thick, charcoal darkness. The branches of the old oaks, draped with dried corn husks like strange garlands, scraped against the glass.



It was at that moment she saw the movement.



Not the wind, not a shadow, but something walking along the path where the hedge used to be. It was a silhouette, too tall and too thin to be a man, hunched as if carrying an unbearable weight on its back. It didn't step; it slid across the wet gravel.



The figure stopped right beside the maple tree Elara remembered from her childhood. On the maple's branches, instead of typical Jack-o'-lanterns, hung dozens of old, blackened wooden dolls. They were simple, faceless effigies, with stick arms and bodies made of dense sacking.



The silhouette raised a hand. A sound drifted out of the fog.



It was a flute. Or, rather, a pipe—an instrument that sounded too sharp and piercing for the otherwise tranquil landscape. The melody was as old as the soil of Oakhaven itself—slow, lulling, and sickeningly joyful, like a lullaby for the dead.



When the figure lowered its hand, one doll was gone from the maple tree.



The fog thickened, swallowing the outline. The pipe fell silent. Elara felt the coffee scald her palm, yet she couldn't tear her gaze from the spot where the Silhouette had stood.



“It’s just an old man. Neighbors getting ready for their ridiculous Harvest,” she whispered aloud, her voice trembling.



But old men didn’t slide. And the dolls hanging on the maple were not just decorations. They resembled something. Something small.



Elara quickly dressed: heavy boots, her mother's old cloak. Grabbing a flashlight, she stepped out into the gloom.



The cold, decaying smell of the fog hit her face. The gravel crunched under her feet. By the maple tree, she noticed the ground was worn down. There were nine dolls, not ten, as she’d first thought. They hung on a thick rope wrapped around the branch, swaying slightly as if listening.



She shone the flashlight on them. Every doll was identical: a dense sack stuffed with straw, tied with twine. But on the chest of each, beneath the sacking, Elara discerned tiny, barely noticeable marks embroidered with red thread.



Symbols. Not letters. Stylized drawings: a star, a circle, a bird.



She hurried back inside. The cold had permeated her bones. Turning on the old computer, she found the local Oakhaven archives.



Under the heading ""Oakhaven Folklore and Traditions,"" she found a mention:



“Annually, on the eve of the Harvest Night, before the Great Bonfire, the village elders gather the ‘Ten Effigies’ (The Ten Effigies). These dolls symbolize…”



The rest of the page was torn away.



In place of the torn text, Elara found an old, scanned newspaper clipping from 1957. It was yellow and brittle, with a title in archaic script:



""Oakhaven and the Mystery of the Missing Birds""



The article recounted a strange series of disappearances in October 1957. Ten domestic birds—chickens, ducks, even a parrot—vanished in the week leading up to Halloween. Local police were reportedly ""baffled"" and leaned toward a stray coyote theory.



But the final paragraph held a strange comment, attributed to an old local farmer.



“It’s not a coyote. It’s the Piper. Every year, the Piper takes what is owed to keep us safe, and none of the townspeople should speak of it. He calls, and they leave. Birds. Or children. It makes no difference.”



Elara gasped. She leaned back in her chair. The Piper. The one she had seen by the maple tree. He had made a calling sound. And he had taken one of the ten dolls.



“The dolls symbolize…” What did they symbolize?



She grabbed her phone. The only person she had spoken to since arriving was Dean Hennessy, the local sheriff.



“Dean, it’s Elara. Are you in town?”



“Elara, of course. We have a meeting about ‘Holiday Safety’ today. What’s wrong? You sound like you’ve seen a ghost.”



“I saw someone. Or something. Outside. It was standing by the maple tree. It was tall, strangely dressed, and it was playing some kind of pipe. And then it took one of the wooden dolls.”



A long silence followed, filled only with the static on the line.



“Elara, listen to me closely,” Dean said, his voice, usually low and ironic, now tight as a bowstring. “Those dolls are decorations. It’s a local tradition. Just stay away from other people's yards. Tomorrow is the Harvest Night. Don't interfere.”



“But there are ten of them, Dean. ‘Ten Effigies.’ And I found an old article about ten missing birds in '57. And about someone called the Piper.”



“Elara,” Dean’s voice grew harder. “You’re reading old folklore. This is Oakhaven. We have our rules. It's just a story. Go to bed.”



He hung up. Elara stared at the flickering screen with the 1957 clipping. The sheriff hadn't just dismissed her; he was scared.



She locked all the doors and windows. The night outside grew absolutely silent, swallowed by the fog. She had three days left until October 31st.



She decided she wouldn't sleep. She had to find out what those Ten Effigies symbolized.

Please help me…","TLDR: always had issues with waking up to alarms, now we have a baby, baby doesn’t wake me up, wife needs help during the night with baby, tries to wake me and I’m either 1) comatose-like state and unwakeable 2) I wake up and I’m mean as hell, like really mean to her and saying random nonsense things. Wtf is going on and how can I stop it. 

So here’s the thing, I sleep hard, normal alarms don’t work. In high school my mom would have to wake me for school.
In college I started putting an nfc tag above my door across the room and in order to turn my alarm off. I learned to get up in my sleep, turn it off, and go back to bed.
Now in adult life my wife helps me wake up for work, I have the shock clock 3 which worked for a few days, but now even on max power doesn’t stir me now.
And to top it all off, now we have a baby, and the sleep windows of sleeping and waking during the night are just not working for me. it’s making me hella depressed, and my wife who is having to stay up and do all of the work with the baby is starting to be at the end of the ropes with it. She tried to get me up to help, because iv asked her to, but nothing gets up, iv told her to do whatever she needs to do get me up, so with my consent, she’s told me that she “tries to beat the shit out of me sometimes” to get me up and it still doesn’t work. However when I do get up, sometimes I don’t even remember that I did, and she says it “wasn’t me”. She would describe me as a calm and gentle type, and I agree. I don’t really get angry at most things and I live my life very laid back and with a “go with the flow” vibe just about every second. However, sometimes when she wakes me up, I yell at her, I make mean comments, do…idk just very odd stuff. Getting up and standing in the middle of the living room, holding a pair of shorts claiming it’s a burp rag of the baby, basically just sleep walking but as the anti-me. I don’t know how to stop this, or what I can do to help, because honestly it’s tearing my wife apart, and I hate to see her in the state she’s in. Can anyone help me figure out wtf is wrong with me? I’ll add in as much random info about my lifestyle as I can below.

 Low(ish) caffeine intake consisting of 1 scoop of gfuel in the morning followed by maybe a 8oz cup of black coffee at work during the week, so max like 200mg of caffeine during the week, and less on weekends, always in the morning.

Low sugar diet, I like my junk food occasionally but I consider myself to generally be a clean eater, I always get at least 80oz of water a day.

I sit all day for work and try to work out for at least an hr twice a week, haven’t been doing that because baby

Only medication I take is a 24hr Allegra before bed

Recovering nicotine addict, been back on my pouches to help with the stress of the baby, so this is something I’m trying to get rid of again

And lastly I have a sleep study here soon with the dr

Nighttime routine is as follows, shower every night around 8-9, help get baby ready for sleep, lay down in bed 10-11, be asleep by midnight, then up with the baby as they need fed and such. I will say we have been pushing that midnight sleep time because it’s one of the few quiet moments of our day that my wife and I have left

I have an 078s, replaced my DF64 Gen2. I love the grinder, but have a few questions.

1) Beans/partial grounds left in the hopper - There seems to be a lot of popcorning, partial grounds (eg. 1/2, 1/4 beans) are left in the bit on the top where I put the beans after it has finished grinding. I usually have to turn to grinder back on and push these in. Is this normal, how can I mitigate?

2) Retention - This may not strictly be retention, but the effect is probably the same. Beans stay in the auger (I assume). I turn grinder on, put beans in, grind until it sounds like it has finished, sometimes even leave it until the 60s cut off kicks in and turns itself off. I get about 0.5g less out than I put in, when I turn the grinder back on it grinds a little bit more. I assume these are beans that were in the auger that never made it to the burrs. This is particularly annoying if I make a coffee after my wife. She's not a coffee nerd and wants the easiest job possible before leaving for work at 5am, so she won't check the grams out a lot of the time. Sometimes I make my coffee in the morning and it obviously grinds a few beans left over from her coffee, because I get 1g+ more out than I put in. She has decaf, and I don't, so I don't really want her beans in my coffee, aside from it just being annoying having to use a teaspoon to remove some grounds from my portafilter to get it down to 18g before brewing.

3) Messy - probably linked to popcorning mentioned in question 1. There are grounds, fines, big fat partially ground beans, all over the back of the grinder. Which isn't a practical issue, but I love how this grinder looks and would rather it didn't look so messy all the time.

  
Is there anything I'm missing in my workflow? I don't use RDT as most things I have read said the 078s doesn't need it, and in most cases recommended not doing it.",1,1762091232.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I’ve lived in dorms with 10+ people, so I know how to compromise. I moved into a nice but expensive apartment with a friend (or so I thought). I even paid double rent for months so we could secure this place. I come from a working-class family, he’s from a very wealthy one — which now really shows.

After 2 weeks, he said he wants to move out because:
	•	he doesn’t like the area,
	•	he found another place,
	•	he says I “need too much privacy” and “get sick all the time” (not true — I had antibiotics but wasn’t contagious).

He told me this one day before a huge exam, and it was overwhelming. Then he said if I don’t like it here, I can also move out — but I’d still have to pay until I find a new roommate (which is hard). Later, he changed his mind and said he’ll leave after the semester.

Other issues:
	•	Laundry 3–4 times a day (even for 2 towels). I have OCD, but that’s excessive.
	•	30-minute showers twice a day, yet he’s messy and never cleans the bathroom.
	•	Uses the living room like his own room.
	•	His girlfriend basically lives here, and it’s suffocating.
	•	Buys expensive stuff without asking (300€ water filter, coffee machine — I don’t even drink coffee) and then blames me for not paying.
	•	I found out he hasn’t paid rent for 2 months while I’ve been paying everything.

Now he has financial control since he can move anytime without loss, while I’d lose my deposit and months of double rent. I also handled all admin tasks and bought shared items.

I want to move out, but it’d mean losing a lot of money. I tried some non-confrontational ways of communicating but he doesnt listen to me.",2,1762091025.0,badroommates,1,1.0,False

The seating is divided into indoor and outdoor sections, with the outdoor area having a queueing space in front, which is quite organized.

As you enter the indoor area, there's the cashier, and behind it is a display of various breads and egg tarts.

We bought a few of our favorite items and headed home to enjoy them, taking photos along the way to capture the joy of the moment. After all, at other branches, there's often a long wait, but today we barely had to queue, which made us very happy.

Once home, we immediately enjoyed these treats as afternoon tea. 

First, I brewed a cup of coffee before indulging in the food.

The egg tart we brought home was still fresh. It's a Portuguese tart with a crispy crust and moderate sweetness. It’s slightly smaller than those I’ve had in Macau, but I think the portion size is just right.

Additionally, I tried the muffin and flaky pastry, but I found myself quite full and unable to enjoy them fully. I decided to save the croissant for breakfast tomorrow.

Perhaps I shouldn't have had afternoon tea so soon after lunch. If I plan it next time, I might have the Portuguese tart at 2:30 PM and then the muffin and bread at 4:30 PM.

1omhkip,https://i.redd.it/x9igkz9kkuyf1.jpeg,Search for the Best BS in VanPort: Episode 4,"**Tammy’s Bitchin Kitchen vs. Bleu Door Bakery**  


One’s a cart, and the other is a sit-down restaurant—but both serve breakfast sandwiches on croissants.

I phoned in the order to Tammy’s since she opens first. With sandwich in hand, we headed to Bleu Door. It’s a well-known Vancouver eatery, but I hadn’t visited before. I was pleasantly surprised to see the savvy European vibe with a focus on French art direction. We decided to have some lattes and compare the sandwiches. As mentioned above, both were on croissants with eggs and sausage.  


**Tammy’s Goober:**  
This is an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach: sausage patty, bacon, a couple of fried eggs, cheese, and a hash brown on a Costco croissant. It’s bold and savory. The meats bring a tasty combination of flavor.  


**Bleu Door Breakfast Sandwich:**  
Scrambled eggs, a large sausage link, and cheddar on an in-house baked croissant. The eggs are fluffy and nicely seasoned. This is a more refined approach and fits the vibe of the restaurant.

  
**Which was better?**  
My wife liked Bleu Door’s more sophisticated handheld best. I preferred the attitude of Tammy’s. Of course, there’s no comparison when it comes to the experience—Tammy’s cold, rainy parking lot can’t compete with Bleu Door’s cozy, beautiful café with craft coffee. But it should be noted that Bleu Door’s sandwich costs a $11 (take out price) and Tammy's is $7.29.

**Bottom line:**  
Both BS are excellent. It just depends on what you’re in the mood for. I’m sure I’ll return to both.

Okay, I have this huge problem and if anyone's willing to help PLEASE, THAT WOULS MEAN SO MUCH.

Anyway, I made fake people to initially make my life more interesting to others 'cause God forbid a girl have fun, but something happened and I feel so stupid for not considering said problem.

 There are four people, to be exact and I will not name drop JUST incase (even if they are fake people, yes.) So person one, which we'll call carbonara, is one of my closest friend of 5-6 years. Person two, eggroll, is the person that got carbonara and I together as friends. Person three, Mac, was a person carbonara, eggroll and I met. And person four, Cheese, is Mac's boyfriend that came with Mac.

I introduced carbonara to one of my IRL friends and said ""Hey, this is (carbonara's real name), the guy I've been talking to you about!"" And she, who we'll call lemonade, quickly became friends with carbonara who was actually still me texting to her in a different account. Lemonade immediately liked carbonara as someone more than friends, but she doesn't know that I AM Carbonara. So to break lemonade and carbonara up, I made carbonara like me. WHICH WAS STUPID, WTF IS WRONG WITH ME, RIGHT? I wanted my life to be more interesting, and I wanted to know what ppl thought of me.

Lemonade, to this day, still likes Carbonara so being her friend, though I actually hate her guts, I told her ""Hey, I told Carbonara that I'll date him for a month 'cause I'm still his friend, I don't wanna hurt his feelings and I actually like someone else."" But Lemonade said ""Oh no, please, if you really like Carbonara, I won't stop you. I mean, I haven't even seen his face, lol, why would I even like him that much?"" AND THAT'S WHERE THINGS GO DOWNHILL. I know Lemonade is starting to get suspicious of Carbonara, Eggroll, Mac&Cheese 'cause I never really had a great history when it came to being honest... So I trued to distract Lemonade by introducing Mac to her. Lemonade liked Mac, he's sweet, funny, but obviously likes him in a platonic way 'cause Mac has Cheese. Mac is gay for Cheese. Mac will never leave Cheese. MAC&CHEESE FO LIFE!

UHM ANYWAY, Lemonade still asks me to see Carbonara's face, but tbh... Lemonade don't go well with Carbonara. Even if Carbonara is a fake person.

SO, people reading up until here... If you are willing to help me out, all I ask from you is a photo of your faces to use to continue the catfish to Lemonade, Water (another asshole friend), Ginger ale, Tea, Coffee, Monster, Cola, Orange juice, Pepsi, Sprite, Hot Cocoa, and Leah.

Does that make sense and has any of you been through the same thing?

I used to work in the corporate business world and I switched careers around 26. I now work (and try to make it) in the creative/editorial/fashion sphere but I struggle to make new friends. What really worries me is that I have been feeling lonely and have felt the need to make new friends for at least the last 8 years and I feel stuck. Through the last 8 years I did make some new friends but I still feel lonely and almost all of my weekends are spent at home. Which is depressing: I still feel young, pretty, I want to have fun, I want to go to dinner, parties, meet nice and kind people, laugh. But I do want those people to be ""similar"" to me in terms of interests, ideally I would want them to work in the creative industry because I would relate more to them and it would make me feel more secure in my career, it would make me feel like I belong, finally. However I admit that I do feel intimidated by people in this industry because I'm afraid they will not find me cool. But I think I hide it pretty well.

I currently live between 2 European capital cities, where there is a lot to do, a lot happening, a lot of people to meet. I feel like I am wasting my life: I see people going out, having fun, or just chilling at home with their friends while I sit in my room alone, and the years go by. I am nice, friendly, I get along with every single person that I work with. And when I do feel like there's a ""window"" for friendship with one of them, I try to go after that while always being super mindful that I am not doing too much, being too needy. So I feel like I do everything right yet IT DOES'NT WORK because I am still lonely and nobody (or very few people) invite me out for coffee, drink or whatever.

I have tried to go to events by myself, I have tried dating apps for friends, I feel like I have put myself out there. Can someone please tell me what my problem is before I lose my mind. I have been in therapy for 5 years and my therapist always tries to understand why I am so obsessed with loneliness, what happened with my parents etc, which I guess is interesting, but doesn't resolve the issue, which is that I currently do not have a social life!!!

I have some good friends that are there for me, that I see on occasion (I did say that I was living between 2 cities - a majority of my friends live in one of them, so I have a tiny social life there (but still feel lonely on week-ends); in the other city I live with my brothers and my mom and don't really have friends, so my social life is pretty much dead there). How does someone try to make new friends for 7 years and doesn't succeed? As I said I am a normal, friendly, good-looking woman so what exactly is the issue?

I would literally just need ONE new friend who could introduce me to her groups of friends and I would take it from there. But even that hasn't happened. I feel like a failure, I feel ashamed that this is where my life is at, especially at 31 (and most people I meet through work are younger, which makes me feel even more uncool and behind).",1,1762090674.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False
1omhgti,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/1omhgti/experience/,Experience,"I had a strange experience.  I invited some AAs I know to an art event.  I consider them my friends.  I care about them.  I am not sure if they care about me, but as one get's older, one realizes the truth of the dictum, it's better to love than be loved.  AA has ironically been a great way for me to practice this, because mostly what I've gotten from the people there is loud interpersonal indifference and maybe anxiety, like someone anxiously soldiering through an interaction.  But one of the things I have noticed in recovery is that connecting with other people takes effort.  It takes a little effort to cut loose.

Upon arrival, there was this immediate letdown.  The social graces you usually expect in meeting were absent.  I know that sounds shallow or something, but it's just a little bit of a bummer when you meet someone and the energy isn't there.  At the end, it was early, but they went straight home.  But while walking, the thing I want to mention that I found most symptomatic was that one walked way out in front, and the other couldn't catch up, and I was in the middle, waiting for them to sort of recognize, hey, we are a group. There was like a  misalignment.  It was early, coffee and convo would have been fun, but they seemed to bee line for home.     

This kind of thing in AA seems to happen again and again.  Or there are variations on a theme of possibly just attentional deficit, depression, anxiety. I think in the future I will extend them invites but it will be with the idea of helping them break out of their routines to have some joy.  I also have to make a conscious effort I think to stop going to AA meetings and do other things.  I think the intense routine and the ease of AA life might make people lose social skills in favor of extreme propriety.  What's the word.  Religious scrupulosity.

7 months (and a lot of sweat, swearing, and bureaucracy) later, it’s almost unrecognisable. When it’s done, it’ll be roughly **150 m² with a pool**, and so far I’ve spent around **£165k total** (house + renovation), but I’ve done a *lot* of the work myself & been incredibly lucky to meet some amazing people en-route who’ve saved me time and time again

Here’s the rough story:

* 🧱 **The property:** solid structure (already earthquake proven) but badly neglected internally 
* 📋 **The plan:** extend, modernise, add outdoor space and pool to make it my future base. ChatGPT is my interior designer + a little Ikea kitchen help
* 💸 **The costs:** building materials and labour here are WAY cheaper than Western Europe-pay in cash and you won’t pay VAT (need local bank account to do this but can be done with property deed while you wait in branch at Erst bank)
* ⚙️ **The nightmare:** you need a local ’magician’ without this don’t even start. Rule number one is FIND YOU LOCAL PROJECT MANAGER. Life without this is hell. Endless coffees, beers and dinners are needed to find your magician. If you are not there regularly you will be eaten alive. I’ve heard stories about people waiting a year just to receive windows when negotiating remotely.
* 🏘️ **Neighbours:** Neighbour relations here are life. A bad relation with a neighbour can destroy your whole project or make it plain sailing. Invest the time, buy the Rakia and apologise a lot! Land boundaries are a lot more ‘fluid’ here.
* **Bills:** Monthly electricty bill is about €50 and €7/month local tax for bins et + 1/year tourist tax on property. No/night tourist tax if property owner or family of property owner. People in my village live here comfortably on €5-700/month (provided you own your house), forigners can do it on €1000 I'd say if your expectations are relativly low.

Anyhoo, to elaborate on the title, my 6 1/2 y/o has ADHD and has been medicated on methylphenidate for just over a year now. We were one of the lucky ones when it came to medication and the whole trial and error process from what I hear. Got her started on methylphenidate first, and we just needed to tweak the dosage before it showed results and once that happened…wow. Night and day difference.

For that first 1.5-2 hours after she wakes up before we medicate her for school, and the last 1.5-2 hours before she goes to bed when she’s not medicated at all (she takes 2 doses throughout the day, and is only 38 lbs, so we don’t wanna overwhelm her body with too much), she’s just absolutely FERAL. Just 100% POSSESSED by the dopamine hunt, and to hell with literally EVERYTHING ELSE.

Personal safety. Food. Naughty behavior. LISTENING at its most basic state in general.

“Please stop hitting me over and over because you think it’s funny that my belly makes that noise, it hurts and we don’t touch people without them saying it’s okay”…when she already zoned out after I got halfway through saying “hitting”.

You switch to just “stop” because it’s shorter and easier for their hyperkinetic little brain to register…but she doesn’t do “listening” as a concept when unmedicated, so THAT doesn’t work either…all the while I’ve been awake for 6 minutes and am in the middle of waiting for my coffee to drip into the cup, and I’m STILL being used like a drum set at a rock concert.

After she got bored with that she ran (heavy-footed, of course, shaking the whole living room) upstairs while screaming/vocal stimming to play with toys in her room…loudly may I add…while I struggle to rouse her ADHD mom out of bed and enjoy my freshly poured coffee, and make the decision to write this post after I begin asking her to NOT drop her toys into her bedroom fan because of all the reasons I don’t need to list here.

But of course, she’s unmedicated and still just a sentient vibration at this point, so I give up and leave her to it while I vent online to other parents who I’m hoping understand and empathize with me.

So…FINALLY…on to the title of the post!

Does anyone else have to put up kind of a mental block before your little hurricane with legs is medicated, to remind you that they’re not really your kid at the moment, or is this the wrong approach?

I love my daughter so much, and honestly spend SO MUCH of my time devoted to keeping her safe and healthy that I feel like it doesn’t come across as her seeing me “showing love” because I’m constantly telling her “no you can’t jump from the top stair all the way to the bottom because that’s dangerous” about 50x before she just does it anyway when I stop directly looking at her, and then SCREAM AT HER and blow my top…but to my point (sorry I’m all over the place, I never get to talk to other adults because I’m basically a SAHD and as I said, it’s early and I’m the only one in the household awake), she’s just genuinely a completely different person INCLUDING personality during that first 1.5-2 hours of the day, and I struggle so much with treating this hyperactive destructive feral chaos gremlin as my well-behaved and sweet little girl before the meds, and I guess I’m just wondering how to compartmentalize that from other parents who most likely are dealing with the same thing?

I definitely do not wanna get into a subconscious habit of dehumanizing her and having that carry over into a learned psychological practice that I keep up on autopilot because of the convenience factor, and have that lead to the only terrible conclusion that it could, where she grows up feeling othered and like her father doesn’t love her unless she’s medicated and “behaving” for him…but goddammit trying to parent an unmedicated 6 y/o with ADHD is hard enough that I am constantly feeling like Sandra Bullock yelling at Keanu Reeves from “Speed” after she finds out the fuel line to the bus has been cut:

“Did you feel like you needed ANOTHER challenge???”

Like…I’m ALREADY operating a vehicle in a way it’s not intended to be used for an extended period of time, with the promise that it’ll explode and kill me and everyone around me if I try and slow down to make it more safe…and NOW I’m leaking fuel TOO???

Anyway…thanks for listening to the lonely and confused inner workings of a 43 y/o SAHD who doesn’t have friends, support, a social life, and apparently watches WAYYY too many movies 🙄🤦🏻😂😫",8,1762090327.0,ADHDparenting,10,1.0,False

For anyone new, every week I take Vegas lines and odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings, FanDuel and OwnersBox salaries to calculate a value score. This helps highlight who's overpriced and who’s underpriced.

These plays tend to be chalky/high ownership, so I typically use them for double-ups, but you’re free to use the info however you want.

⚠️ Disclaimer

* No such thing as a lock — use at your own risk.
* Not betting advice — just my process and what works for me.
* I post for free. Use it, fade it, roast it — up to you.

🔑 Core Plays

I run an optimizer for every slate to identify the strongest builds. Since sharing full lineups is against T&C (and would just have everyone running the same thing anyway), here are a few core plays the optimizer is high on:

* QB: TBD
* RB: TBD
* WR: TBD
* TE: TBD
* DST: TBD

My usual diet is cooked animal-based and decided to try (again) to incorporate raw foods slowly. I got oysters and ate 2 of them. About 5 hours later I started vomiting for around an hour. Thankfully now I'm all right.

I thought oysters didn't have to be very good quality to be eaten raw... even so, they are imported from France - the brand is called Thaëron. 

I'm at my wit's end at this point... every time I tried a raw food I got a horrible expirience. 

About a year ago I got raw milk (the farm said the cows were grass-fed on their Facebook page) which I was drinking for like a week until the ""side effects"" showed up - bl00d in my st00ls and insanely sharp pain during b0wel movements... for about 6 months. I stopped looking down because every time I did, I saw a pool of bl00d down the toilet... I was insanely scared. And no - I have never had bl00d in my st00ls ever in my life and it only occurred because of that raw milk, and it's gone because I don't drink raw milk.

A few weeks ago I got raw eggs (the best I could find - bio eggs with 0 on the number on the egg) and also started vomiting but it was much worse than the most recent vomiting - it continued for about whole 24 hours... I'm pretty sure I was throwing up bile at some point.

Why does it have to be so hard to feel good? I usually have low energy (not to mention seborrheic dermatitis) from eating cooked animal-based and I can't get anything done - I don't even have the energy to do activies which are usually considered enjoyable - hanging out with friends, taking a walk or even play video games... let alone study or work. 





And before someone says ""it's not only about food"" - I go out in the sun for at least an hour every day while barefoot in the grass.

My sleep schedule has been very regular recently and synced as much as possible with my natural circadian rhythm, though my sleep isn't very high quality because of noise issues.

I used to go to the gym but stopped nearly a year ago and felt a bit better for like a month in terms of energy when I stopped but now it's about the same... I can't believe I used to force myself to go the gym tired...

I have never smoked anything, never drank any kind of coffee or alcohol of any kind. Never taken any stero1ds or peptides and I avoid any kind of pills as much as possible.

I avoid salt as much as possible, though I have not completely eliminated it from my diet. If I'm eating any fruit (or vegetable - like cucumber or bell pepper, i don't eat broccoli or the more toxic vegetables) I make sure it's pesticide-free.

I don't have anything plastic I touch or whatever else little gimmick I have heard- I do almost everything that I ""should"" be doing in the terms of health. I obviously avoid goy slop and seed oils and stuff which is considered ""water"" at this point. 

God forbid I try something like raw bone marrow next time I feel like trying a raw food - I will probably end up in a hospital almost paralyzed for life like goatis.

I am very disturbed knowing cooked food will eventually destroy me with all the oxidation of the cholesterol and AGEs and being able to do nothing about it.

I just don't know what to do anymore. Everyone tells me a different thing and nothing works... As the title says - it feels like a dead end. Is that how a human is supposes to live? If it is, please someone convince me it is that way so that I stop trying to fix what can't be fixed and focus on something else...",2,1762090165.0,RawMeat,0,1.0,False

I resigned from my job a few months ago because I went through a lot of mental exhaustion, in a car accident and been incredibly sick and on top of that, management were not supportive at all and didn’t really see me as a human being. I decided to leave that place so I could give myself a break before I start working somewhere else, I now cannot find a job anywhere, I constantly get rejected, I have zero money to my name, no car, no driving license and I live with my parents who are both super narcissistic. I’m just so incredibly drained from everything going on and there’s nothing I feel I can do about it. I also don’t have any friends, no partner. I have no support in my life and it’s really fucking painful. I can’t even remember the last time I had a hug from someone. I can’t do the things I like anymore, can’t get my nails done can’t get my hair done or get fancy coffee etc, I used to be able to do all that for myself and treat myself. I don’t feel like myself anymore, I have quite a feminine personality so I like doing all of those girly things. I’m trying my absolute best to apply to every damn job in any sector, I spend most of my waking hours applying for jobs and it’s driving me up the wall. 

The past few weeks I have either been sleeping throughout the entire day and night or not sleeping at all for days at a time. Two nights ago I slept for around 32 hours, my mum came to check on me and she thought I was just coming down with some sort of sickness, I woke up once or twice to shut my window because it got cold

I don’t wanna do this anymore. I don’t know where to start and I don’t know when this cycle will end. I completely give up.

I [26M] am confused - was it genuine or a test?","So I (26M) met this girl (20F) recently. We connected almost instantly. She was open, expressive, and there was this undeniable energy between us.

It started simple - I asked for her Instagram after seeing her once, and we ended up chatting for a couple of hours that same day. The conversation had fun banter, a bit of teasing, some light flirting - and honestly, she seemed to enjoy it too.

The next day, we planned to meet for coffee. She showed up in a dress I had once mentioned I liked. During the meetup, she kept the conversation going, laughed a lot, made eye contact - it just felt right.

Later next evening, we ran into each other again while we were both with our own friend groups. And again, there was this back-and-forth - she kept noticing me, laughing louder, holding eye contact across the room. It was subtle but powerful. We were texting each other most of the time too, funny teasing too. I clicked some pictures of her too and sent it to her immediately. 

Then that night, things flipped.

She suddenly asked me, “What are your intentions?”

I replied, “What are yours?”

She said she had zero intentions and wanted to be just friends. She even said she didn’t want me to like her because she didn’t want me to get hurt. It's not possible for her even if she liked me a bit. 

I told her I was starting to like her - that I wanted to know her better, not jump into something serious. But she insisted that she couldn’t see me as anything more than a friend.

What confuses me is this:

* Before this, her actions clearly showed interest.
* She sent pictures without me asking.
* She texted first multiple times.
* She got upset when I couldn’t meet her.
* Her body language screamed attraction - and I’m not imagining that.
* It’s been 48 hours since we last talked. I’ve pulled back completely. Haven’t texted. I’m trying to keep my composure and not chase.

But I can’t shake the thought, was she testing me? Trying to see if I’d stay composed? Or did she genuinely mean it and just got scared of things getting real too fast?

She’s young, 20, and might not even know dating dynamics or strategies. It could just be her way of protecting herself or slowing things down.

The truth is, I genuinely like this girl. Not in a desperate way, but in a grounded, “I’d want her in my life from my core” kind of way.

So my question is - what’s the best approach here?

Should I keep pulling back and let her come if she wants?

Or reinitiate later in a light, low-pressure way and rebuild comfort first?

1omh7qu,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1omh7qu/husband_28m_and_me_27f_had_a_huge_argument_about/,Husband (28M) and me (27F) had a huge argument about finances. Am I too controlling?,"I am working full time, my husband has started a school, for which we both saved for a long time, so he can finish it debt-free, and for which we recently moved back to his home country for. We have a joined account. 
The original agreement was, which isn’t upheld (hence we fought):
- his mum (I assumed his parents) helps us & pays rent + utilities; 
- his sister pays rent (below market value) to him for a flat he owns (in a different city) & we use this for groceries 
- we use my income everything else (gas; flights, going out, gym,…) & try to save us much from my income us possible.

Now his mum got huge health problems, from which she is slowly recovering. From a financial point of view, I didn’t realize that’s a problem for the following reasons:
1. I was told his dad earns very good money and I assumed they would have savings at their age, not live paycheck to paycheck. 

2. His sister got 15k a few years ago for university, my husband never got  anything for his education (he went to a public school), which is also why they agreed to pay our rent (our rent for two years would be closer to 10k, not even 15k, so it’s still a “good deal” for his parents).

3. SIL (F25) & BIL (M31) regularly received help e.g., parents in law paid for lots of baby stuff , covered their rent one time, their groceries. 

4. Just 2 months ago (before MIL got sick) , SIL and BIL threw a party for the baptism of their baby, where my husband’s and SIL’s dad (FIL) covered the food at the restaurant for everyone, which was 2k. This could have covered 4 months of rent for us. 

My husband said he feels bad now, asking his mum for money, since they didn’t send any. She is scared she will lose her job due to the long period of absence. I told her she focus on recovering. A good employer wouldn’t dismiss her over this and if they do, she can always find a new job. 
I also think my husband should not ask her for money, but he could ask his father instead, since he also gave this generous gift at the baptism to SIL. 
My husband and I got into an argument, asking why I am so frugal with the money, he has always stepped up when I needed money. That’s true, but he never covered any big expense for me. My parents covered RELIABLY my degree + rent + living expenses a few years ago (I’m extremely grateful for) & I just expected a similar reliability from his parents. For me, this is not about the money, what really gets me angry is the lack of reliability. What if we didn’t have the money for the rent and he would have to stop his school? All the money we spent on his school, down the drain without completion. We trusted the promise his parents made & they broke it. I just feel betrayed. I am already covered a huge part of husband’s tuition (never got a thank you from his parents), and now it’s more and more asked for. I work 50h a week. when I tell SIL about my workday, she just gets big eyes “wow your work until 5 p.m.? That’s so long!” - that’s a rather short day for me, girl?!? Like that’s completely normal when you work full-time????
His whole family-in-law just makes me so angry these days. 

I told him I have been covering the groceries from my salary this month without any discussion, even though it was not our agreement.
My husband said he never goes out, he could live with 20€ a week if necessary. I was very confused and said it’s not about that.  I want us to have a fairly good life too, getting a coffee occasionally, eating out twice a month. 
We would save maybe 60-100€ by not going out, but covering utilities +  of rent is a whole different dimension.

Then solution he proposed we could both agree on: he will ask his parents for 200€ this months & he will use all of SIL’s rent money we receive for our rent.

Again, for me it’s not about the money, it’s about the unreliability and unfair treatment compared to SIL. My husband says I am too controlling with the money.
What do you think about the situation? 

TLDR: husband and I saved for his school; I am working full-time, while he is in school; his mum agreed to help us with the rent, but she recently got health problems. Parents-in-law broke their promise and now won’t cover the rent, even though they just paid 2k for a party their daughter threw and gave 15k for her university. I am angry about the unreliability and unequal treatments husband tells me I am too controlling with the money. ",2,1762089957.0,family,9,1.0,False

The methane sibo diet calls for low fiber and the other issues call for high fiber.

I can’t eat hardly anything without it causing excess gas or pain in my esophagus anymore.

I also have a poly in my gallbladder they are monitoring and will be getting a HIDA scan.

Anyone have methane sibo and other issues? Any tips? Also, I’m a pescatarian, and lactose intolerant. And I don’t want to gain weight.

1omh4ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bloggerblog/comments/1omh4ha/the_ultimate_guide_to_novelty_diplomas_from/,The Ultimate Guide to Novelty Diplomas: From Personal Keepsakes to Perfect Gifts,"Let's be honest, most of us don't spend our days thinking about diplomas. They’re the kind of thing that gets tossed in a folder or stored in a dusty tube somewhere, forgotten until you need it for a job application or a background check. But what if a diploma could be more than just an official document? What if it could be a source of joy, a piece of personal history, or the most thoughtful gift you ever give?

That’s the wonderful world of novelty diplomas. They’re not about forging credentials; they’re about celebrating moments. Think of them as highly personalized pieces of art that just happen to look incredibly official and impressive. So, who are these for? Well, just about anyone.

First, there’s the personal keepsake. Maybe your dog ate your actual high school diploma. It happens more than you’d think. Or perhaps you want a beautiful display copy for your office wall, but you’re too nervous to take the original out of its safe deposit box. A high-quality [novelty diplomas](https://www.diplomacompany.com/) replica solves that perfectly. It looks and feels so real, with its raised seals and textured paper, that you’ll be the only one who knows it’s a stand-in. It’s for your own sense of pride and accomplishment, a daily reminder of a goal you achieved.

Then there’s the gift angle. This is where it gets really fun. Imagine a husband who always jokes about getting his ""Ph.D. in Couch Potato Studies."" For his birthday, you could have a beautifully crafted novelty diplomas created with that very title, his name, and a hilarious major. It’s a gift that shows you listen and have a great sense of humor. It’s a conversation starter that will have everyone laughing when they see it framed in the game room.

They’re also perfect for retirement parties. That colleague who’s been the heart of the office for 40 years? Present them with a ""Doctorate in Office Gossip"" or a ""Master of Coffee Brewing."" It’s a unique, personal tribute that beats a standard plaque any day. The key is the quality, though. A flimsy piece of paper from a random website won’t have the same effect. The best novelty diplomas have a weight to them, a feel of authenticity that makes the gesture feel sincere and well-considered, even if the subject is all in good fun.

For graduates, a novelty diplomas can be a fantastic placeholder. Let's face it, many universities take months to mail out the real thing. Giving a graduate a stunning replica on their graduation day gives them something tangible to hold and display immediately, while they wait for the official one to arrive. It shows you’re thinking a step ahead.

Ultimately, that’s what these custom documents are all about. They’re not about deception; they’re about connection. They connect us to our own memories in a beautiful way, and they help us connect with others through laughter and thoughtful, one-of-a-kind gifts. It’s about honoring the real milestones with a touch of personal flair, or just bringing a smile to someone’s face.

Sometimes diet coke also works but it also contains caffeine. So what to do? What can I have so that I don't go over the board?

I recently got a Gaggia Classic from my dad. It has been sitting unused for quite a while, and I have not descaled it yet.

When I try to pull a shot, water (or coffee) spurts violently out of the portafilter, sometimes shooting close to a metre away. If I remove the portafilter, the water flow from the group head looks smooth and even. But as soon as I lock in the portafilter with the basket, even with no coffee in it, it starts spraying everywhere.

Video of issue https://youtube.com/shorts/Oz9JBFXqS3E?si=4UNS6oSJ46thBv2p

I have cleaned the shower screen and dispersion plate, but that did not change much. I am using the pressurised basket, so I am wondering if the valve inside could be blocked or gummed up after sitting for so long.

Could this just be limescale or a clogged basket valve? Should I try descaling the whole machine first or replace the basket and start fresh?

Any tips or step-by-step advice would be greatly appreciated.",1,1762089063.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

1omgu8b,https://i.redd.it/weodth91fuyf1.jpeg,An exhaustive review of my perfume decants and partials,"**About me:** I like clean scents and lean towards fruity-floral smells, mostly white florals. However, I cannot tell notes apart like some of my friends do. At best, my reviews are “ooo, this smells awesome”, “hmm, this smells okay” and “yuck wtf?” If you are like me, you might appreciate my review too. Some of the words here are the thoughts expressed by my friend. We have very opposite tastes and she can tell notes apart.
 
**Perfume reviews:**

YSL Black Opium: 8/10. An evening scent with a complex profile. It is something everyone will like. On a pleasant, windy evening, I can smell this on my friend and smile (because I gave her my decant). She says she smells the vanilla, coffee, and complexity. I trust her.
 
CH Good Girl: 8/10. My office perfume because it’s super non-offensive. A typical “fruity-floral, mostly white floral” perfume.
 
CH Good Girl Supreme: 8/10. Feels like a heavier version of the OG. Good for evenings.
 
CH Good Girl Blush: 6/10. Very floral, I don’t smell the fruity part much. Not my thing.
 
Givenchy L’ínterdit: 3/10. Tuberose max – Sprayed this and walked out of my room. My mom fresh out of pooja room: “The flowers I bought today are smelling extra strong.” Spoiler: she wasn’t smelling the flowers.
 
Prada Paradoxe: 10/10. My diva perfume. I spray this to lift my mood. Fresh, clean, opens citrusy, dries down vanilla. Projection: If you spray enough, it will announce your arrival. Longevity: You can smell it on unwashed clothes for days. Over months, the citrus opening mellowed down. My friend hated the citrus opening, but she likes it more now.
 
Prada Paradoxe intense: 10/10. Slightly creamier version, less citrusy. Rest all is the same imo. My friend loves this, says this is everything the OG is not, lol.
 
D&G Light Blue: 9/10. The perfume that pulled me into luxury perfumes. Citrusy, fruity, white floral. I smell like old money when I wear this. Easily layerable with other perfumes. My friend hates this because of the citrus, yet she wore it last time because once the citrus mellows down, the middle notes are addictive. Unlike most citrus perfumes, this actually lasts long.
 
Mugler Alien: 7/10. It’s a heavy, good, kinda old-school perfume. Longevity is 3 days (jk). Projection: You will not smell anything else but this. My friend loves this, swears by this, sleeps in this, and cried dry tears when I gifted her the full bottle.
 
Lattafa Yara Tous: 6/10. I don’t smell the mango at all. I smell the coconut. It’s a pleasant smell, but doesn’t blow my mind. For the price point, it’s fine.
 
Armani Si Passione: ?/10. Just ordered it after smelling at a mall. Sprayed it today but I am not sure if I like it or not.
 
Ariana Grand Cloud 2.0: 7/10. Love the bottle shape, but wish the material was a bit more premium. Very creamy, light and sweet perfume, like a fluffy cotton candy I guess. Lol. I spray it on my mom a lot for some reason.
 
Escentric Molecule no. 1 + Iris: 10/10. What a perfume! Online reviews describe it as woody, but I smell it floral. I love this perfume, I feel the price is justified. Stays a few hours on skin, and few days on clothes.
 
Escentric Molecule no. 1 + Mandarin: 9/10. Very strong orange zest opening. Great for avoiding my friend. Once the citrus note flies away, you are left with the same pleasant floral smell.
 
Chanel Chance Eau de Tendre: 7/10. Not my taste at all, bought thinking I was buying something else. Lasts long though. I think it’s the musk and amber notes I don’t like.

When someone orders a book from your site, another company handles everything: they grab the book, pack it, and ship it straight to the buyer. You don’t touch the book or ship anything yourself, which felt like a dream come true for me.

I started a small online shop with my favorite types of books, and it’s been a fun little side project that covers my coffee and book habit.

1omgr7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1omgr7a/face_id_an_the_dangers/,"Face ID, an the dangers.","Now I know most of us, don’t look at Face ID as a bad thing but if you still with the narcissist please be careful 

It has occurred to me, that while I was sleeping my Nmum has been using the Face ID on my phone to unlock it, an then activating find my iPhone to track where I was. The hints she was doing this were not subtle, they were glaring. 

So I’ve been getting up an going out because I’m trying to save what’s left of who I am, so for 13 days my iPhone has been out of commission due to the fact of forgot password I knew she was getting in to it some way I knew she was, and  I just couldn’t figure this out 

So I changed my password a few times, and then because I have Audhd lol so, then I have to do the wait 13 days thing but during this time she’s been going more nuts than usual and it lead me to question why, and today I figured it out. 

The way she got into my phone was Face ID, while I was sleeping, all she had to do was show the phone in front of my face and it would open. She has been going nuts can we take it to the shop to get the apps back can we take it to some place can we pay someone, and it occurred to me why would she want that back why would this be driving her nuts more crazy than usual with my phone. 

She has asked me recently do you have all the apps back are they all working, I nodded. I’m pretty sure she’s checked if I activated Face ID she’s also been trying to get behind me to check what I’m doing and if it is active or not. This truly is next level. My first stalker my mother, never thought I’d say that… and the second is my sister both narcissist but I find it true. 

Just remembering, I said where I was one day and she followed me, actually followed me, the flying monkey took her for a coffee, and she just dropped well me and her were there and we didn’t see you at all. - do I need any more evidence? Smdh and I didn’t even think twice, she followed me….. 

I say this because recently the same behaviour has happened with a piece of mail she wants me to open, she legally cannot open my mail without me opening it and I could get her done for it, so I know what’s in this letter and I refuse to open it an she is practically begging me for this information, I’ve cut her off from all other information and have told people to email me do not send anything to the house she’s checking pockets she’s checking everywhere and now she is so desperate for me to open this mail, I already know exactly why it is, I have no desire to open it. She has done this before and I looked it up and I said you open my mail again and I am telling the police. 

So very similar behaviour, she was always hovering around my phone, always in the room and I think I caught her a few times hovering over me trying to activate it, she’s stood over me with my phone made some excuse, but never thought she would ever do something this diabolical it quite frankly would never cross my mind I lay on my back as I have a bad back easier for Face ID , turns out i couldn’t have been more wrong. 

I now also believe her asking me where have been on day was trying to confirm the accuracy of find my iPhone. An guess what I think the ton of bricks just hit me with the reason my sister could find me in a domestic abuse refuge, was because she did the same thing as the mother, Face ID find my iPhone. So not just one person two it seems. Yeah I don’t know how mortified I should even be about this at this point. Because think I already had one nervous breakdown too many so yeah. This is how the sister tracked me to college every day too when I used to live with her for a year then had to escape to emergency housing, I heard that she knew where you were. Again please get rid of this feature before it causes things like mine. 

Just adds the information here

Find My iPhone can locate your device as long as it is connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data, regardless of the distance between you and the device. The accuracy of the location can vary based on GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular signals, but it does not require you to be physically close to the iPhone to find it.

So I’m not saying all of them will do this but I think if you live under the same roof as the narc be careful because Face ID is not your friend in this instance it will work against you. 

So yes cut to yesterday and again it turns out she was following me, why ? Because I go to the same store the same time almost every weekend, and this time I didn’t, I know she went to that store, I know she got things from that store, and she got so angry so mad I wasn’t there that I wasn’t where I should have been, and that she cannot track me anymore that she ripped off the fridge door, and has damaged a cupboard, and yes to all flying monkeys etc I did it don’t you know even when I wasn’t there magic that isn’t it ? btw she has done this before damaged my bedroom door at one point smashed it off its hinges  ( because I said no to her ) and this was all out of anger this was all out if rage, because she couldn’t find me she I wasn’t where I should be, and truth be told I do not know how long she has been getting into my phone and tracking me I do know she’s been getting in to my phone and reading everything she got her grubby little hands on. I’ve been only back a year and it’s a year too long worse decision of my life never again ( by the way in noticing my phone used to be hot and send out shock waves I’m assuming because this is when Face ID an find my iPhone was on, I used to put it on a table when I was out and you could hear it go bang boom and send them to these things I heard it and I always thought it was so strange but in thinking I find this is because since turning this off my phone is now cold and doesnt shock me at all again this would tell me I have this right on the  money it was doing that because it was tracking it was doing that because that’s how it track you, shockwaves pulses, another can open worms everywhere kinda day lol ) 

She now can no longer track me I’ve removed the app, Face ID isn’t even done, so heads up if you live with them or you have please remove find my iPhone app and see what they do watch there reaction we have to be smarter than they are, we have to be the one step ahead. So I can only give you my experience. 

So now I have removed that she huffing blowing getting physically distressed I’m leaving the house now her demeanour has changed, she seems a lot more stressed than she used to, because I have now removed another layer of her control. To peel back the layers of the covert narcissist web the awful insidious web they weave, is something I have never truly ever known anything like this in my life 

Please all stay safe, protect yourself arm your self with the information you need to stay one step ahead, covert are harder to unravel they are harder to know what’s going on, and I found another layer of her sick twisted game, please everyone protect yourself, guard your peace because your life really does depend on it, so wishing you all a very safe day and hopefully if this helps one person just one then what I go through is worth decoding her for and I wish for us all to get out, to be safe and start finally living, Monday I hope there’s some good news, be safe!!

Calling all Gary's, Quinn's, H.U.E's and everyone inbetween.

**Quickly:**

To avoid saturating google and splitting the conversation across numerous threads, I have deleted all of my reddit posts regarding my site and this is one consolodated thread.

Website:

[https://finalspace.co.uk](https://finalspace.co.uk) was created by myself in 2024 for Final Space fans since Warner Bros wrote the show off for tax reasons. It's completely advertisement free and will always be so it can be a safe place for everyone to watch the show without having to worry about ""Hot H.U.E's in your area"".

On Final Space you can...

**Watch:**

You can watch all 36 episodes of Final Space in 12 different languages (English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Persian / Arabic, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish (European), Spanish (Latin America) and Turkish) as well as there's now subtitles in the respective 12 languages.

That's a total of:

1728 x Audio files

432 x Subtitle files

**Download:**

In order to save operating costs as google drive was costing me $10 a month to store the downloads, I have made seperate google drives for each language, these can now be found on the download link at the bottom of every episode, I'm slowly working through these so bare with, but eventually all 12 languages will be downloadable with subtitles.

**Extras:**

The website itself is translated into the respective 12 languages which it will automatically detect based on your browser language and if you want to change it you can do so manually using the language select in the top right.

There's links to official sources such as Star Cadet for merchandise, Final Space Ends for the graphic novel and more.

**Coming soon:**

I currently do not have a graphic novel order, however it seems like there's plenty of you who are planning on uploading a copy, so once a copy is available, I will be providing somewhere to read it and potentially also translating it.

I plan on looking into some of the translations and fixing them up as well as a few graphical bugs.

Any other feedback or suggestions, drop them below and I'll maybe add them to the list of improvements.

Just a quick about me, web development is just a hobby for me all self taught, it's not something I do for money nor work, just for fun. Recently my mental health has been down in the dumps thanks to some individuals in my life so if you're asking for fixes, features or anything else please bare this in mind as while 99% of you are lovely and understanding some of you aren't and the 1% sound louder to me than the 99%, so please be considerate.

That been said you can find me on instagram although currently empty, will probably post updates and other projects on there as well as generic stuff like pictures of places I visit and my motorcycles when my mental health improves.

1omgr2r,https://i.redd.it/hr3styxbeuyf1.jpeg,An exhaustive review of my decants and partials,"**About me:** I like clean scents and lean towards fruity-floral smells, mostly white florals. However, I cannot tell notes apart like some of my friends do. At best, my reviews are “ooo, this smells awesome”, “hmm, this smells okay” and “yuck wtf?” If you are like me, you might appreciate my review too. Some of the words here are the thoughts expressed by my friend. We have very opposite tastes and she can tell notes apart.
 
**Perfume reviews:**

YSL Black Opium: 8/10. An evening scent with a complex profile. It is something everyone will like. On a pleasant, windy evening, I can smell this on my friend and smile (because I gave her my decant). She says she smells the vanilla, coffee, and complexity. I trust her.
 
CH Good Girl: 8/10. My office perfume because it’s super non-offensive. A typical “fruity-floral, mostly white floral” perfume.
 
CH Good Girl Supreme: 8/10. Feels like a heavier version of the OG. Good for evenings.
 
CH Good Girl Blush: 6/10. Very floral, I don’t smell the fruity part much. Not my thing.
 
Givenchy L’ínterdit: 3/10. Tuberose max – Sprayed this and walked out of my room. My mom fresh out of pooja room: “The flowers I bought today are smelling extra strong.” Spoiler: she wasn’t smelling the flowers.
 
Prada Paradoxe: 10/10. My diva perfume. I spray this to lift my mood. Fresh, clean, opens citrusy, dries down vanilla. Projection: If you spray enough, it will announce your arrival. Longevity: You can smell it on unwashed clothes for days. Over months, the citrus opening mellowed down. My friend hated the citrus opening, but she likes it more now.
 
Prada Paradoxe intense: 10/10. Slightly creamier version, less citrusy. Rest all is the same imo. My friend loves this, says this is everything the OG is not, lol.
 
D&G Light Blue: 9/10. The perfume that pulled me into luxury perfumes. Citrusy, fruity, white floral. I smell like old money when I wear this. Easily layerable with other perfumes. My friend hates this because of the citrus, yet she wore it last time because once the citrus mellows down, the middle notes are addictive. Unlike most citrus perfumes, this actually lasts long.
 
Mugler Alien: 7/10. It’s a heavy, good, kinda old-school perfume. Longevity is 3 days (jk). Projection: You will not smell anything else but this. My friend loves this, swears by this, sleeps in this, and cried dry tears when I gifted her the full bottle.
 
Lattafa Yara Tous: 6/10. I don’t smell the mango at all. I smell the coconut. It’s a pleasant smell, but doesn’t blow my mind. For the price point, it’s fine.
 
Armani Si Passione: ?/10. Just ordered it after smelling at a mall. Sprayed it today but I am not sure if I like it or not.
 
Ariana Grand Cloud 2.0: 7/10. Love the bottle shape, but wish the material was a bit more premium. Very creamy, light and sweet perfume, like a fluffy cotton candy I guess. Lol. I spray it on my mom a lot for some reason.
 
Escentric Molecule no. 1 + Iris: 10/10. What a perfume! Online reviews describe it as woody, but I smell it floral. I love this perfume, I feel the price is justified. Stays a few hours on skin, and few days on clothes.
 
Escentric Molecule no. 1 + Mandarin: 9/10. Very strong orange zest opening. Great for avoiding my friend. Once the citrus note flies away, you are left with the same pleasant floral smell.
 
Chanel Chance Eau de Tendre: 7/10. Not my taste at all, bought thinking I was buying something else. Lasts long though. I think it’s the musk and amber notes I don’t like.

1omgpav,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseMedicine/comments/1omgpav/tcm_in_insmnia/,TCM in Insmnia,"
According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the primary causes of insomnia (Bu Mei) are as follows:

1.Dietary Impropriety: Overeating or consuming excessive amounts of food leads to food stagnation and impairs the Spleen and Stomach function. This can produce Phlegm-Heat, which accumulates in the middle part of the body (Zhong Jiao). This Phlegm-Heat then rises to disturb the mind, and the rebellion of Stomach Qi disrupts sleep.Furthermore, beverages like strong tea, coffee, and alcohol are also contributing factors to insomnia.

2.Emotional Disturbances: Unresolved emotions or sudden anger can damage the Liver, leading to Liver Qi Stagnation. This stagnant Qi can transform into Pathogenic Fire (Liver Fire), which harasses the Heart Spirit, causing mental restlessness and insomnia. Alternatively, excessive emotional stimulation (the Five Emotions) can cause intense Internal Heart Fire, which agitates the Spirit. Excessive joy or laughter can over-excite the Heart Spirit, making it unsettled. Sudden fear or fright can lead to Heart and Gallbladder Deficiency, resulting in timidity and an unsettled Spirit, preventing sleep at night.

3.  Improper Balance of Work and Rest: Excessive fatigue and overexertion can damage the Spleen. Conversely, too little physical activity and excessive rest can also lead to Spleen Deficiency and weak Qi, impairing its transformation and transportation function. This results in an inadequate production of Qi and Blood, which fails to nourish the Heart, leading to insomnia due to the Spirit lacking its foundation. Excessive worry and overthinking can injure both the Heart and the Spleen. An injured Heart leads to a gradual depletion of Yin and Blood, causing the Spirit to lose its residence. An injured Spleen causes poor appetite and reduced food intake, further depleting the source of Blood production. Deficient Nutritive (Ying) Blood fails to nourish the Heart, resulting in an unsettled Spirit.

4.  Constitutional Deficiency after Illness: A prolonged illness, or aging, can lead to Blood deficiency. Deficient Heart Blood fails to nourish the Heart itself, leading to an unsettled Spirit and insomnia. Aging and a weak constitution can also lead to general deficiency of Yin and Yang, causing insomnia. For those with a naturally Yin-deficient constitution, excessive sexual activity can consume Kidney Yin. This leads to Yin deficiency in the Lower part of the body, which fails to ascend and cool the Heart. This disrupts the balance between the Water (Kidney) and Fire (Heart), allowing Heart Fire to blaze alone. This excessive Fire agitates the Spirit, leading to a breakdown in the communication between the Heart and Kidneys and mental restlessness.


TCM Treatment Methods for Insomnia

1. Internal Herbal Regulation 
TCM treats insomnia by emphasizing ""pattern differentiation and treatment determination"" (Bian Zheng Lun Zhi). This means formulating a treatment plan based on the patient's specific symptoms and constitution to identify the cause and pathological mechanism. TCM believes insomnia may be related to dysfunction of multiple organs like the Heart, Liver, Spleen, and Kidneys, thus requiring personalized treatment. Different Chinese herbs are selected according to the patient's symptoms, such as Coptis (Huang Lian), Spine Date Seed (Suan Zao Ren), Indian Bread with Hostwood (Fu Shen), Fleeceflower Stem (Ye Jiao Teng), Dragon Bone (Long Gu), Oyster Shell (Mu Li), and Arborvitae Seed (Bai Zi Ren). These herbs have functions such as calming the spirit, nourishing the Heart, soothing the Liver, and benefiting the Kidneys, effectively alleviating insomnia symptoms and helping patients return to restful sleep.

2. Acupuncture
Acupuncture is a vital TCM treatment method that adjusts the body's Qi and Blood flow by needling specific acupoints, thereby improving sleep. Commonly used points include Shenmen (HT 7), Neiguan (PC 6), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), and Baihui (DU 20). Acupuncture therapy is known for its safety and lack of side effects. By unblocking the meridians and regulating Qi and Blood, it helps patients restore their normal sleep rhythm.

3. Therapeutic Massage (Tuina)
Tuina is a therapy that uses manual techniques to stimulate the body's meridians and acupoints, thereby regulating Qi, Blood, and the balance of Yin and Yang. For insomnia patients, professional Tuina massage can help them relax, relieve tension and anxiety, and consequently improve sleep quality. Through gentle techniques like pushing, grasping, pressing, and kneading, stress is released, allowing both body and mind to gradually enter a state of tranquility, creating conditions for good sleep.

4. Gua Sha Therapy
Gua Sha involves scraping specific areas of the body with a Gua Sha tool, causing minor petechiae (Sha marks) to appear on the skin. This aims to unblock the meridians, promote blood circulation to remove stasis, and purge turbid pathogens. By regulating the body's Qi and Blood flow and improving organ function, Gua Sha has a unique therapeutic effect on insomnia caused by Qi and Blood stagnation and the accumulation of internal turbidity, restoring the smooth flow of Qi and Blood and laying the foundation for stable sleep.

5. Auricular Acupressure with Seeds
The ear is considered a microcosm of the entire body, with corresponding reflex areas for all the internal organs and body parts. Auricular therapy is based on this principle, stimulating specific points on the ear by attaching Wang Bu Liu Xing seeds (or similar) for the patient to press. This regulates the functions of the internal organs and improves sleep. This method is simple to perform, and patients can press the seeds themselves in daily life for continuous stimulation, helping to calm the heart and spirit and promote sleep.

6. Lifestyle & Routine
TCM emphasizes prevention, and health preservation is a crucial part of treating insomnia. Patients can adjust their daily routines and sleep environment, maintain a regular biological clock, and create a conducive sleep environment to reduce the likelihood of insomnia. Additionally, choosing a suitable sleep position is important. Sleeping on one's side is often recommended. The Qing Dynasty health specialist Cao Tingdong pointed out in his ""Sleep Secrets"": ""When sleeping on the left side, bend the left leg and left arm, resting the head on the hand, and extend the right leg, placing the right hand on the right thigh. The opposite is true for the right side."" This posture helps relax the muscles throughout the body, allowing for more sound sleep.

7. Emotional Regulation
TCM considers emotional distress to be a significant cause of insomnia. Therefore, emotional regulation cannot be overlooked in treatment. TCM practitioners guide patients on how to adjust their mindset, maintain a cheerful mood, and avoid the impact of excessive anxiety, depression, and other negative emotions on sleep. Through psychological counseling and emotional adjustment, patients can face life with a peaceful mentality, creating a favorable psychological environment for sleep.

8. Dietary Therapy
TCM dietary therapy is an effective adjunct means for treating insomnia. Patients can choose suitable foods for nourishment based on their constitution and symptoms. For example, foods like red dates (Hong Zao), longan fruit (Long Yan Rou), and lotus seeds (Lian Zi) have the function of nourishing the Heart and calming the Spirit. Regular consumption can help improve insomnia symptoms. By skillfully incorporating these natural ingredients into the daily diet, one can satisfy the palate while achieving the benefit of food therapy for sleep.

9. Music Therapy
TCM music therapy uses elements like rhythm, melody, and harmony in music to regulate the body's Qi and Blood flow and the balance of Yin and Yang. Soothing, gentle music can help patients relax and ease tension, thereby improving sleep quality. Different musical pieces have different effects. Selecting music suitable for one's constitution and insomnia symptoms is like playing a lullaby for the mind. For instance, the 'Jue' note in the five-tone system corresponds to the Liver. For those experiencing dizziness, irritability, and insomnia with dreams, listening to somber and sentimental music (classified as 'Yin' music), such as ""Gada Meilin"" or ""Er Quan Ying Yue"" (The Moon Reflected in the Second Spring), can have the effect of draining Liver Fire and subduing hyperactive Liver Yang.

10. Qigong & Daoyin
Qigong is a unique TCM method for health preservation. By adjusting breathing, intention, and movement, it regulates the body's Qi and Blood flow to achieve the goal of treating insomnia. Practices such as Baduanjin (Eight Section Brocade), Taijiquan (Tai Chi), and Wuqinxi (Five Animal Frolics) can help patients relax, enhance their physical constitution, and improve sleep quality. In each breath and each movement, deep relaxation and harmonious unity of body and mind are achieved, making sleep deeper and more stable.

Reason being is I want options that I can possibly blitz into overnight oats (I don't want to pay the price of overnight oats even though I freaking love them as an option, plus I think I may be able to make them better macro wise). I've only tried a few protein/ meal replacements powders and loathed them, mainly the Slim Fast powders and ISO Dunkin Iced Coffee flavor. I really want to try the Ghost and maybe Quest protein powders but not sure what everyone's experiences have been. I thought about getting sample packs, but by the time all is said and done I might as well get a tub for the price. Okay so premix drink wise, I like all the Atkins protein shakes (except the strawberry, dark chocolate, and root beer); Quest vanilla protein shakes and salted caramel; ALL Spylt Milk flavors (these are the GOAT, they have caffeine and flavor, but are like 35 bucks on Amazon with subscribe and save for a case of 12, well worth it but I need to budget better). I am mainly looking for a good vanilla and/or chocolate flavor, but I'm open to dessert flavors for overnight oats (I've seen marshmallow, cookies, and cinnamon bun flavors that sound good in theory). The requirements are that they taste good on their own mixed with liquid (should translate well to overnight oats if so), under $60 bucks for a tub, and lower in sugar or are sugar free, and are under 200 kcal per serving (I'm not trying to make a calorie bomb of overnight oats unless it's a straight meal replacement).

Yesterday it happened after we went out for dinner (big meal) and I had a coffee at around 22:00. Was sitting in the car at 22:30 and it just suddenly happened. Maybe every other 8 beats, then 20, then 4 beats. Total random. And the weird feelings in and around my throat. It’s a tightness / fluttering feeling that starts around the bottom of my throat that extends to the solar plexus in the middle under my ribs. I get very very anxious from this feeling and I just went driving around till 00:00/00:30 until I noticed I had to burp a few times, started yawning and it literally just stopped in a few seconds. It’s like everything just calms down and stops. All the tightness and weird feelings in chest and throat goes away and I’m back to normal.

Success so far at 48 days:

* 16 Cahuilla
* 13 LF
* 14 Angel X Althea
* 20 Althea X Sharxx

79% Germination rate

Not bad.  Next time, I will do several things differently as I was not happy with some things:

1. This mix is 50/50 organic.  I'm going to do much more organic.
2. I used sand in this mix, even medium (pool filter) sand is too coarse.  I have a bag of [cactus seedling mix from Rooting for You](https://www.rootingforyouplantnursery.com/products/cactus-and-succulent-seed-starting-premium-potting-mix) (pumice, coir, sand) that I will try next.
3. I planted one, ONE seed per cell on this thing.  Either I get some of those magnifying lighted glasses, a pair of good tweezers, and no coffee - or they are going to be less fancy.
4. Sealing this tray was troublesome because of the heat probe from the thermostat.  I think I will just set the probe in a small cup of sand alongside the tray next time.
5. I tried sealing with regular old masking tape, and with Parafilm.  Neither worked real well.  There's three layers (lid, cell tray, bottom tray).  I may trim the lip on the cell tray next time to make it easier to seal together and use some Scotch Super 88 electrical tape.

Things I think that worked really well:

* I soaked the seeds in 3% peroxide.
* I moistened the soil with 3% peroxide
* I misted the seeds into the soil with 3% peroxide

Seeing a pattern here?  I'm very surprised that the peroxide didn't burn anything but it worked very well and I have zero fungus.

We should think about the environment and planet that we are leaving behind for our future generations. How can you as an individual contribute to sustainability lifestyle in large cities like Bangalore? Here are few things that I practice:

1. Sustainable Mobility

I use public transport instead of driving. With the stressful traffic, I would be fine as long as I am not driving.

2. Waste Reduction & Recycling

I segregate wet waste and dry waste. I compost wet waste: Composting reduces landfill waste and provides nutrient-rich soil. I use a porcelain coffee mug instead of paper cups in office.

3. Energy Conservation

I replaced traditional bulbs with LEDs, I unplug electronics when not in use and reduce phantom load by unplugging chargers and other devices. I re-purpose the waste water from the water purifier for cleaning the home.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1omgd9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1omgd9m/struggling_with_narcissistic_parent_in_my/,Struggling with narcissistic parent in my pregnancy,"A little background for context: I grew up in an Indian household with a narcissistic mother and a submissive father. My father truly loved me, but my mother’s love was always conditional and often absent. I was beaten brutally behind my father's eyes and given silent treatment almost every week. I became a people-pleaser and carried deep emotional scars. However I was academically strong and eventually built a life abroad. My father passed away in 2019, and since then my mother lives alone. I support her financially each month — beyond her pension — covering not just her needs but also her luxuries like travel, jewelry etc. Through therapy, I’ve been processing my childhood trauma. Meanwhile I met my husband abroad. My husband, who has Indian roots but was raised in a 1st world country, has gone through something similar — he also had toxic Indian parents but, with the help of therapy, he cut them off five years ago without regret.

Now I’m five months pregnant. I recently went to India both to visit my mother before giving birth and to finalize the purchase of an apartment that I bought for her comfort, since her old place had no elevator. 
Three days ago, we had a major fight. It started when a friend from abroad asked me to bring several packages for his child that he ordered online without asking me. Though I found it inconsiderate considering limited luggage space, I agreed and planned to discuss it later. My mother, however, kept criticizing him and suggested I should humiliate him indirectly by talking about it in front of someone else. I found that degrading and told her so — asking her to reflect on where such behavior comes from. She got furious, saying she wouldn’t move into the new apartment because it’s “my apartment,” despite it being chosen and bought for her comfort. Hurt and exhausted, I said fine — she could stay where she is. My husband and I decided to move to an Airbnb for our last two days to avoid more conflict. As soon as we started packing, she threatened to commit suicide — something she’s done my entire life to manipulate my father and me. This time, I didn’t give in. I told her those threats wouldn’t work anymore. Triggered and overwhelmed, I confronted her about everything — her lifelong narcissism, the emotional abuse to me and to my dad even in his sickness, her denial of what happened when I was sexually harassed by her sister’s husband, whom she still sees as if nothing happened. In response she shouted, cried, called her brother to complain about me, denying everything she said before. Then I gave her an ultimatum: either she tells her sister the truth in front of me or we cut ties. She asked my uncle for advice, and after some resistance, they finally agreed to call my aunt. My aunt was shocked, but apologized, and acknowledged what happened. 
After the call, I asked my mother to apologize to me too. She did, but with an insincere attitude, saying she didn’t know what for. I rejected that hollow apology. The next two days, she gave us the silent treatment — ignoring my husband entirely, not even offering morning coffee, no basic mannerism. Offended, I decided we wouldn’t eat at home anymore. When she suggested lunch on our last day, I declined, saying we preferred to eat outside. She again threatened not to move into the apartment but in a calmer tone. I said it was her choice, and she went silent again.

After returning abroad, I texted her to say we’d arrived safely, but the message didn’t go through. Then I tried to call on Whatsapp and see that it's not working. I thought she turned off the internet by mistake. So I texted my uncle and told him to call her and let her know. Apparently he could not contact her either and got worried. He went all the way to visit her and found her fine, just sulking and claiming she “has no one.” She intentionally turned off her phone. He told me not to take it personally, that she’d calm down in a few days. 
But this is a constant cycle — drama, manipulation, silence, and no accountability. Everyone in the family excuses her behavior, puts up with it, saying she lives alone, but she’s always been like this. She is the youngest daughter of the family as well and her siblings always covers up for her even when they get abused by her. She refuses therapy, though she clearly needs it. I’m exhausted and don’t want her emotional chaos to affect my peace, especially now that I’m pregnant. I feel torn — I want to cut her off for my mental health, yet I feel guilty knowing she’s alone and won’t seek help. I don’t know what to do anymore.",5,1762087608.0,AsianParentStories,1,0.86,False

## How to Assemble and Decorate Your Basket Like a Pro

The presentation is just as important as the contents!

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://productroute.pages.dev/?q=christmas%20gift%20baskets)

1.  **Choose Your Container:** Don't limit yourself to a traditional wicker basket. Think about a nice storage bin, a wooden crate, a colorful mixing bowl, or even a new tote bag. The container should be part of the gift.
2.  **Create a Base:** Use a filler material to lift the items and make the arrangement look full. Shredded paper crinkle cut, fake moss, or even a clean tea towel work wonders.
3.  **Arrange with Intention:** Place the tallest item in the back. Group similar items together. Make sure everything is visible and facing forward. Play around with the layout before you secure anything.
4.  **The Finishing Touches:** Wrap the entire thing in clear cellophane and tie it shut with a beautiful ribbon. Tuck a sprig of holly, a small ornament, or a candy cane into the bow. **Crucially, always include a handwritten card or tag.**

## Your Go-To Solution for Thoughtful Giving

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://productroute.pages.dev/?q=christmas%20gift%20baskets)

Whether you’re a last-minute shopper or a meticulous planner, **Christmas gift baskets** offer a flexible and deeply personal way to give. They transform a collection of small gifts into one grand, thoughtful gesture that shows you truly pay attention.

So, this year, skip the generic gift card and embrace the art of the basket. Your loved ones will thank you!

I really need an outside perspective because my head and heart are spinning.

We’ve been together for about 10 months. The last few months have been hard, every few weeks, we end up fighting because we just can’t seem to hear each other. When he says something to me, I take it as criticism. When I say something to him, he takes it the same way.

I know my own flaws: I’m not a good communicator when I feel hurt. I shut down, stop talking, and sometimes get defensive. He says that when I do that, it feels emotionally torturous for him, like I’m shutting him out completely. And I understand that.

But on my side, I often feel underappreciated. I know he loves me and cares about me, but sometimes it feels like our relationship exists only within the four walls of his apartment and our favorite coffee shop. We never do anything special or spontaneous. He never plans anything.

He knows I love flowers, but he’s bought me flowers twice in 10 months. For my birthday, he got me a card and a card game because he said he didn’t know what to get me. I don’t want expensive gifts, even a 3€ bunch of grocery store flowers would make my day. It’s not about the object itself, it’s about feeling thought of and special.

And then there’s sex. We both like sex, but for me, it’s a form of closeness, of repair and reassurance, it’s how I feel desired and connected again. For him, it’s something that happens when things are good, when everything is calm and stable. That difference has been breaking me slowly. I’ve initiated many times and been turned down, and every time it happens, it sinks my confidence a little more.

A few days ago, we had a really hard talk. Both of us thought we were going to break up that day because we were so tired. But we decided to try again. I told him I feel like I love him more than he loves me, and he said he wishes he could love me the way I love him, but he doesn’t know if he can. When I asked if it’s just me or anyone, he said probably anyone, that maybe he’s broken or doesn’t know what real love feels like. He even told me that I deserve someone who would love me more than I love them.

And now I just don’t know. Part of me wants to fight for this. Another part of me feels like I’m holding on because I’m scared to let go. How do you know when love isn’t enough anymore?",0,1762087512.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False

And let's call them A, B, C. C had just joined the friend group a year ago so she's kind of new. our group went through a lot of changes regarding the members of it. But A is basically the ""leader"" of our group. 

 Aaron a month ago, C and B started talking shit about A when she wasn't hanging out with us because she was on vacation with her family. But I don't like having different opinions about others, so I went along with it and agreed with them, basically ""hating her"". And C and B have also been really secretive that week. 

After A got back, we had a little get together at a coffee shop we all like going to. But when I came (I was a little bit late for personal reasons), they all ignored me. I was confused, but A turned to me saying that I am toxic and they don't wanna talk to me anymore. she told me that C and B were ""testing"" me if I was a good friend, which is very fucked up and kind of like the middle school drama you used to have.

Because I was upset since I was very close friends with them, I left and deleted their contacts since I don't want to have contact with people toxic like that. I moved on, and was practically ignoring all their calls, which was mostly B and C. 

Recently after A moved away, B and C started talking to me when they see me around the town (I live in a pretty small town so you see everyone almost daily), and acting very nice about me. of course I was ignoring them and asking them to leave and stop talking to me since I didn't want to be friends with them anymore.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Uganda and Rwanda are two destinations that quietly surprise even the most seasoned travelers. Side by side in the heart of East Africa, they offer a blend of culture, adventure, nature, wildlife, and wellness that few regions can match, and all within journeys that feel immersive rather than rushed. Uganda is the kind of place that draws you in slowly: vibrant communities, homestays filled with laughter, food cooked over wood fires, and landscapes that shift from rainforest to savannah to crater lakes in a single trip. It’s a country where adventure is woven into daily life, from white-water rafting on the Nile to hiking the mystical Rwenzori Mountains, tracking tree-climbing lions in Queen Elizabeth, or meeting the mountain gorillas of Bwindi. Community and home-based tourism are strong here, offering authentic cultural exchanges that leave a meaningful impact on both sides. Rwanda, meanwhile, is calm, clean, and deeply intentional. It’s a place where conservation and culture sit at the heart of tourism. Volcanoes National Park offers some of the world’s most intimate gorilla encounters, while Nyungwe Forest surrounds travelers with ancient canopies, chimpanzees, and misty hikes that regenerate the soul. Its capital, Kigali, is modern yet rooted in tradition, with vibrant art spaces, coffee culture, and museums that tell a powerful national story. Rwanda is also emerging as a wellness haven, with quiet lodges, pristine lakes, and retreats that encourage reflection and renewal. Visiting both countries unlocks a perfect harmony: Uganda’s raw, abundant wilderness paired with Rwanda’s serene, polished experience. This best suits travellers seeking wildlife encounters, immersive cultural experiences, adrenaline-filled adventures, or slow, meaningful travel that supports local communities. These two nations offer journeys that stay with you long after you return home.",1,1762087424.0,UgandaRwandaAdventure,0,1.0,False

I’m finally ready to upgrade from instant coffee and dive into the world of semi-automatic espresso. Not looking at cappuccinos or milk drinks just yet — I want to focus purely on pulling great shots first.

At first I was looking at automatic coffee machine such as the DeLonghi Magnifica EVO, but after doing some research into this subreddit I've decided that semi automatic is the way to go and this is my planned setup for the time being:

* Machine: ECP33.21 (recommended in this sub) — \~€140. This is the european version of the ECP 3420 (I think...)

I suppose I could also consider the Breville Bambino, which goes for around 300 eur. Not sure if it's worth it

* Grinder: Baratza Encore — \~€180
* Beans: Lavazza Super Crema (1 kg for \~€35) (I don't know anything about beans, I've just seen this one recommended) (edit: segafredo intermezzo is also an option and super cheap for 10 eur /kg)

Since I already have a good precision scale, I wanted to ask:  
**What else do I need?**

* I’ve read I absolutely need a good tamper. Any recommendation?
* Is a leveller / distributor necessary at this stage?
* Any other must-have accessories or tips for getting started with espresso?

Bloating has been an issue since week 6. I looked at least 4 months pregnant at 6 weeks. Clothes stopped fitting very early on.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1omg4fq,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1omg4fq/giving_money_to_a_houseless_man/,Giving money to a houseless man,"Good morning, something has been bothering me for the last 3 years.

I change cities 3 years ago to come take care of my daughter who is now passed.

From the time I got here I was driving an hour every morning to go to the facility where my daughter was at being treated.

 The first few months I start seeing a older man at the little McDonald's I stop at to get coffee before I get on the highway to drive up to my daughter.

He was such a nice gentleman. He would be standing outside begging for money and he was always so gracious and nice. So I've always given him whatever change I had sometimes a couple of dollars. If I was getting paid that day sometimes I would give him $20 he would always be so happy when I would give him the $20.

It's been going on for 3 years but something that I noticed is that when I give him money I'm sure other people are giving him money too.

There are times where I won't see him for two or three days and then on the 4th of the 5th day he'll be out there asking for money but sometimes he would be so beat up or his face would look terrible like he had been in a fight or had an injury.

Recently I hadn't seen him out there in about a week or more, I got my money ready from my pocket that I always keep a little bit of change just so I can give to him,  as I come through the drive-thru because he's always waiting at the end of the drive-thru and this morning he looked so bad I could tell he hadn't eaten.

The first 2 years, I could tell he was getting washed up somewhere and changing clothes but this morning he look like he had not had a shower and his face was gashed up.

My heart sank, I pulled up to him and I said my brother, it's good to see you. I haven't seen you in a long time and I could tell he was so disoriented he was so out of it because he usually recognizes me right away it's always with smile at me and tell me to have a good day.

 He's a older guy maybe in his seventies and he kind of shuffles when he walks but today he was sitting down at the end of the drive-thru. His eyes were watery and I can tell he did not recognize who I was until as I was just pulling away.

I feel so guilty about all of this because as I was sitting drinking my coffee I start to feel like maybe I'm the reason why he's getting beat up or gashed or falling out, maybe I'm supporting his drug habit or alcoholism. I don't know whatever it is, I feel terrible I'm not going to stop giving him money because maybe just maybe he's buying a little food with that sometimes he will even ask me to buy him coffee and sammy in the past if I see him but my heart is hurting and I'm thinking about it too much.",2,1762086888.0,homeless,2,0.67,False

Well, it's cake day today. I'm 31.. 
I got to spend my morning in bed with a coffee while my husband manned the fort which was nice. 

My mum text me this morning wishing me a happy birthday, and that was that. I have 3 other siblings, 2 are under the age of 15.. and I have a 21 year old brother. My siblings are all significantly younger than me, but I can't help but feel a little sad and yea I'll admit, jealous, because it's yet another birthday my mum hasn't sent me anything. Not even a card.. 

I talk to my mum everyday; I always think we're close in relationship.. but more like siblings I guess. I live away at the moment and moved away 2 years ago.. but I am due to move back closer to them in a few months time. 
I make sure to FaceTime with the kids all the time, I talk to her often etc..

My brothers birthday was in August, and she phoned me up saying she was trying to find something meaningful and special because it's his twenty first.. but it was my thirtieth last year and all I had was a pair of trousers (to replace the ones she ended up taking when I moved out)  she was even going to work my birthday last year until I burst into tears thinking we would of at least gone for lunch together. 

I sound selfish. I sound entitled.. I shouldn't be bothered. But I am, and that's why I'm posting on vent I guess.. 

From the age of 10? I just remember my birthdays she stopped making effort, so when I see her planning parties and big gifts for my siblings I always get disheartened.. and I shouldn't.. 
you know when my sister turned 13, she wanted this huge party (as did I) I wasn't aloud, but she had one.. countless birthdays. When I turned 18 she said ""you're an adult now"" but my brother is 21, he's already left home but without fail she always buys him something big. 

Christmas 2 years ago.. she bought my brother and dad a ps5 each, my sister one of those hair wraps, my other sister bundles of toys.. and I got nothing (I only lived half hour away at the time, and were due to move back again soon after my husbands job finishes in may) 

I just alway seem to be forgotten about on Christmas and birthdays but my siblings always have effort and time put into presents.. ah well..

1omg1ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1omg1ak/decided_to_write_this_post_and_track_my_progress/,Decided to write this post and track my progress on manifesting my sp!,"I tag it as success story because I believe my story will eventually be one of the most exciting success stories here :)

So a bit context first, my sp and I briefly dated but then due to personal reasons we were not ready to lead it to where it should be. Then we had a month of no contact. 

During the no contact I didn’t have any idea of manifestation at all, but now when I looked back, I just realized that actually I was subconsciously manifesting that we would eventually reconnect, because I was focusing on my own life and a few other very cool things came to me that I thought I would tell him when we reconnected and he must be impressed by me. Then I reached out to him and no surprise he asked me how my life was going and really impressed by those things I’ve achieved :D

Then I asked him if he wanted to meet me and he said yes, I thought it might just be a conversation over a coffee for an hour or two but actually we spent a whole afternoon and had dinner together which was really felt like a date again. I was so happy!

Not too long after that day I randomly got to know the manifestation theories and wasn’t too sure if it can be real or what, but I made some research and decided to give it a go. I want to keep it simple because my life is kinda busy at the moment, in the past ten days I used “he is ready to fully commit to me” as affirmation and I did post some progress about the 3d. Undeniably I was spiralling and struggling to find proofs from 3d but nothing much, tbh we are human and it’s totally understandable that we always want to find clues to be assured. But somehow I just firmly believe he would definitely want to be in a relationship with me. 

We haven’t talked for a few weeks until l asked him out again, but he said had already got plans but still he asked me if we could meet another time, I said yes and we messaged a few rounds and then he didn’t reply. But I don’t read too much through lines, I just believe as long as we meet again he still gets the sparks and has feeling for me :P 

But since yesterday was the first of November, as a beginning of a new month, I decided to enhance my manifestation on him, and I’ll come here to update every time I achieve some new progress. I’ve never manifested anyone before because I don’t even know manifestation until a few weeks ago. I’d like to try it, and just do it before doubting, I want him back, he is obsessed with me and definitely not over me, I can firmly tell it from the subtle movements and expressions when he was with me. My affirmation now is “(his name) is in love with me, he wants to date me again and ask me to be his girlfriend. We are in a committed relationship now because I am the best girl he has ever met who deserves all his love and loyalty”. 

We just need a little bit of time and that’s not a problem at all! I’ll still keep being a cool girl, motivated by part of that affirmation “I am the best girl he has ever met”, sticking to my own goals, working hard and climbing up the ladder as much as I can, doing wonderful things outside of work, keeping fit and beautiful, eating well and sleep well. I always get what I want and this won’t be an exception at all :D 

I hope my story will inspire you to be positive and especially to upgrade yourself to a better version during your time manifesting your sps! 

I’ll come back and update in the comment as I’ll go out with my sp again in a few days :D

And he's a very nice guy. Intelligent (he's a young professor at the university), helpful, very generous...I get why she's happy with him.

But he has this tendency to 'mansplain' everything. Everything! It took me awhile to notice this. And I'm pretty sure he's trying to be helpful but there's a serious lack of awareness that comes with it. I've seen him explaining the concept of Ikigai to another friend - who is from Japan. He was speaking to my friend's dad - who's a dairy farmer who left school at age 14 -  and said- *""Do you remember what Nietzche wrote about nihilsm?""* 

No dude, of course he doesn't. 

My friend has always chosen men who she subordinates herself to, which is her decision, but it's increasingly difficult to be around this guy, and they've been coming as a package. I organise to meet her for coffee, he's there too, telling us about coffee beans. We organise to catch up for dinner, he comes along. 

He's nice. And I'm genuinely happy my friend is so happy, because she's had some bad luck with her relationships. She's being treated very well and she seems happy enough to be the recipient of all this new knowledge. I haven't brought this up with her yet.

Ever since his wife died, Rodger Strongarms has had to juggle his job as a construction worker and taking care of his joey. He subsists almost entirely on coffee, but at least he's good at heavy lifting.

More info about the challenge can be found [here](https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/6689300). If you'd like to participate, but don't have any ideas, why not check out my [Random Paleofolk Generator](https://perchance.org/amber-isle-paleofolk)?

And with that, my 13 Paleofolk Challenge is finished! Overall, it was fun for me to research a wide variety of animals and figure out how to anthropomorphise them. Before I started this, I couldn't name an animal from the Silurian off the top of my head, but now I love [galeaspids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galeaspida). My favourite character I've drawn for this is [Pixie Brightflight](https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/6742318), because she's so cute. My least favourite is [Owen Sizzlepaw](https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/6745572), because I rushed him and he has tiny arms.

1omfy1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/condocollapsemiami/comments/1omfy1k/want_to_understand_ultimate_perfection_of_life/,want to understand ultimate perfection of life ? here is that ultimate goal,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1762086327.0,condocollapsemiami,0,0.5,False

The bottom (shown) is just ply maybe about 4mm thick, so I think I'd need something that either attaches to the sides, sticks on (the board is heavy but nothings much would go on it so maybe wood glue would hold okay?), or that can be fixed to 4mm ply with minimal access to the inside (I could fit some fingers in, that's about it).",4,1762086213.0,woodworking,0,0.83,False

Night.  
Laptop glowing.  
Sudden realization that coding tutorials lied to me.

I thought I would just “build websites.”  
Relaxing vibes. Coffee. Lo-fi beats.

Reality?  
I was in a cyber war with CSS.  
Buttons flying everywhere.  
Navbar acting like it had trauma.  
Google giving me answers like “have you tried turning your brain off.”

Then clients arrived.

Client 1:  
“Can you make my site look like Apple?”  
Budget: *Two meat pies and vibes.*

Client 2:  
“Can it also have payment… booking… login… inventory… and AI?”  
Me, smiling like a hostage:  
“Of course.”

Every time I fixed one bug, three more spawned like it was a video game boss fight.  
Firebase would crash.  
Cloudinary would say “not today.”  
React would throw errors in languages I do not speak.

At some point I sat on the floor staring into the abyss like a Marvel villain in origin mode.

Then it clicked.

This is not chaos.  
This is the job.  
This is the grind.  
This is the moment every builder goes through before they level up.

So I locked in.

Build. Break. Fix. Ship. Repeat.

Now we have Astraronix.

It is combat sport with a laptop.  
You fight. You learn. You evolve.

If you are building too, keep going.  
If you are a business owner, get digital early.  
If your system breaks, do not panic.  
You are just in Act 2 of your movie.

Roll credits later.

In my life, I have sabotaged four relationships with genuinely great men. It always started the same way. At first, I was excited but also very anxious. Then, once we moved in together, after a few months I would start finding reasons to break things off. My anxiety was always through the roof, even though they did nothing wrong. All of them were caring, loving, and respectful. I always wanted closeness, craved it, sought it, and once I got it, I became so scared that I wanted to run away, argued about nothing, etc. And I did go away. To other countries, new careers, hobbies, you name it.

So yes, I have learned that I am a fearful avoidant, shaped by childhood experiences that can't be unseen. I am also a very anxious person. I am writing this now, sitting in my big apartment, the sun is shining, coffee in hand, yet my body is so tense as if I am in danger. I am not, but that is how it feels. It feels like that most of the time. No matter how good my partner is, I eventually run away.

The thing is, talking therapy has not helped me in the way I hoped. It has helped me understand my patterns, be more mindful of my behavior, and connect the dots. But talking about my childhood over and over doesn't create a sense of safety in my body. The anxiety and fear are still there.

I believe I am not the only fearful avoidant here. Maybe some of you have found ways to heal, or are in the process of healing? I know there is no magic fix, but I really want to do better in relationships. I invest effort and money into therapy, read books, and try to learn, but understanding does not equal healing.

### For the Tech Guru

Forget another cheap phone charger. The tech lover in your life appreciates gadgets that solve problems and look cool doing it.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://productroute.pages.dev/?q=stocking%20stuffers)

*   **Portable Power Bank:** A slim, fast-charging power bank is a lifesaver. Look for one that's small enough to fit in a pocket but powerful enough to give their phone a full charge.
*   **Bluetooth Tracker (Tile or Chipolo):** Help them keep track of their keys, wallet, or backpack with a tiny Bluetooth tracker. It’s a practical gift that saves a ton of headaches.
*   **Cable Management Sleeves or Clips:** The bane of every tech-savvy person’s existence? Cable clutter. A simple set of clips or a neoprene sleeve can tidy up their desk or car setup instantly.
*   **Screen-Cleaning Putty/Gel:** This fun, gooey gel gets all the dust and crumbs out of a keyboard or the tiny crevices of a phone. Satisfying to use and incredibly effective.
*   **Smart Notebook:** A reusable notebook (like a Rocketbook) lets them write notes, scan them to the cloud, and then wipe the page clean. It’s perfect for the eco-conscious techie.

### For the Foodie in Your Life

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://productroute.pages.dev/?q=stocking%20stuffers)

For this person, food isn't just fuel; it's an adventure. Their stocking stuffers should reflect their culinary passion.

*   **Gourmet Hot Sauce or Hot Honey:** Level up their pantry with a small-batch, artisanal hot sauce or a drizzly, sweet-and-spicy hot honey.
*   **High-Quality Olive Oil or Balsamic Vinegar:** A small bottle of infused olive oil (like garlic or chili) or a thick, aged balsamic glaze is a luxury they’ll use to elevate every meal.
*   **Unique Spice Blend:** Find a company that creates interesting, hard-to-find spice blends for things like steak, cocktails, or even popcorn.
*   **Fancy Local Coffee or Tea:** Support a local roaster and give them a bag of freshly ground, single-origin coffee or a box of high-quality, artisanal tea bags.
*   **A High-End Citrus Reamer or Zester:** A small, high-quality tool like a wooden reamer or a sharp microplane zester is something they might not buy for themselves but will use all the time.

### For the Ultimate Homebody

This person finds their bliss in the comfort of their own space. Their stocking stuffers should be all about coziness and ambiance.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://productroute.pages.dev/?q=stocking%20stuffers)

*   **A *Really* Nice Pair of Socks:** We're not talking basic multipacks. Think merino wool, thick thermal, or cashmere-blend socks. The kind of socks that feel like a hug for your feet.
*   **Jar Candle or Reed Diffuser:** Choose a sophisticated, calming scent like sandalwood, cedar, or lavender to make their space even more relaxing.
*   **Mug Warmer for the Desk:** Keep their coffee, tea, or hot cocoa at the perfect temperature from the first sip to the last. It’s a game-changer for slow sippers.

### Pro Tips for Nailing the Stocking Stuffer Game

*   **Go for Consumables:** Things like coffee, snacks, fancy soap, and candles get used up, making room for new things next year. It’s the gift that keeps on giving (and then disappears).
*   **Think Practicality:** What is something they use every day that could be upgraded? A cheap plastic sponge could become a fancy, wooden dish brush. A messy toiletries bag could become a hanging travel organizer.
*   **Personalize It:** Anything with a name, initial, or inside joke on it automatically feels more special. A keychain, a notebook, a mug... the options are endless.
*   **It's Not About the Price:** The best stocking stuffers are thoughtful, not expensive. A $5 bottle of their favorite hot sauce means more than a $20 random gadget.

1omfsve,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapze/comments/1omfsve/want_to_know_final_end_of_all_knowledge_here_is/,want to know final end of all knowledge ? here is that perfection of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1762085897.0,collapze,0,0.25,False

We used to have coffee and listen to music and have bacon or sausage biscuits for breakfast every Sunday. Just kind of making a few special hours just for us.

This morning listening to music and drinking coffee I thought some bacon might be good for breakfast, I haven't had any in a while.

Now I'm so sad I can't eat it. This is the perfect day, hour, minute, second to hold the one you wake up next to just a little tighter. Please, for me?

One day one of you is going to wake up alone for the first time and in that moment and every moment that follows it's just too late.",304,1762085724.0,GenerationJones,53,0.99,False
