1n4balj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n4balj,John and Daryl Hannah‚Äôs relationship dynamic,"The photos above were taken in NYC on January 8, 1994. 

These are various quotes about John and Daryl‚Äôs relationship dynamic according to John‚Äôs friends:

Robert Littell: ‚ÄúThey broke up in a huff following a fight at the airport in 1994. John moved out of her apartment and into the New York Athletic Club for a while until he found a place on Hudson Street. Somehow they just never spoke again. I was upset at John for their awkward parting. I thought he owed her a call. But really, I never figured them as marriage material anyway. I'd already concluded that I got along better with Daryl than John did. They were very thin-skinned around each other. Lots of tiffs and small skirmishes. John was worn out by the battling.‚Äú

John Perry Barlow: ‚ÄúI loved them both, ""but by the end their relationship had become very aggressive. In fact, I advised them both to end it. Because they were both so passionate, I just felt they were going to make each other suffer. It wasn't anybody's fault. They were both wonderful people in their own way. But the chemistry had broken down. Relationships have their own internal mysteries. The dynamics get set up, and nobody really understands the rules. 

That's not to say that there wasn't some lingering bitterness. John might have been willing to continue the friendship without the romance. Daryl didn't want it. She was
angry. She felt she‚Äôd been inappropriately hoodwinked, she‚Äôd been manipulated. Right or wrong, that's how she saw it. 

In addition, there was John's relationship with Carolyn Bessette. It wasn't possible for him to have any contact with Daryl, because Carolyn was rather controlling. He knew that I continued to see a fair amount of Daryl, so from time to time he‚Äôd ask me wistful questions about how Daryl was doing. He'd always be very solicitous. Hed ask me to convey his fond regards. I had the feeling with John that once he loved somebody, he always loved them.""

Richard Wiese: ‚ÄúIt was a tough but interesting relationship. They were both a little spoiled. They were both used to getting their way. Daryl once commented to me that all of John's friends felt sorry for his having to put up with a Hollywood actress. 'But you know,' she said, 'he's no day at the beach.' I suppose she meant that he wasn't easy either.""

Phil Auburn: ‚ÄúBy the end of 1993, John and Daryl seemed to be on the verge of splitting up. They spent most of their time arguing. Everything became a bone of contention between them. I remember when they took out some videos from Blockbuster and forgot to return them. They fought like cats and dogs as to who would pay. In July 1993 John had quit his job in the district attorney's office and was searching for something meaningful to do with his life. Daryl whose career had peaked, appeared in a bunch of second-and third-rate films. Her focus was John. She hoped to tie the knot with him, but it was all rather hopeless. As promising as the relationship had been, they had no future together. It was the beginning of the end.""

Random quotes about John & Daryl:

‚ÄúSuzanna Bowling recalled meeting John for the first time at a party in TriBeCa. ""I was hanging my coat, and he walked in with
Daryl Hannah, and they were arguing. I knew Daryl from Los Angeles. She was very manipulative and clingy. She was ditzy‚Äîin fact, she was nuts. I never knew her to be straight. She was always on something‚Äî she mixed pharmaceuticals with alcohol. When I saw them at the party, they were already at odds. And that was because she was so crazy. She was beautiful, truly beautiful, but she was also extremely vulnerable. She was warm, even passionate, but also suffocating. Her demeanor must have become wearying for John.""

‚ÄúThey were both exceedingly immature. John and Daryl were cases of arrested development‚Äîthey were like children. When Daryl lived with Jackson Browne in Santa Monica, she installed a swing set and a teeter-totter in back of their house. She liked to be pushed back and forth in the swing. I once bumped into John and Daryl at Skaties, a bike and skate shop in Marina del Rey. He was GQ perfect in shorts and an unbuttoned, formfitting shirt. Daryl was carrying on like a ten-year-old, trying on every pair of Rollerblades in sight. Evidently Daryl 
and John had a sexual routine that included all sorts of childlike games. They'd jog, and then they'd play tag, and then they'd blade, and finally theyd go upstairs and fuck like bunnies. And then they'd start all over again.‚Äù

‚ÄúJack Donahue, a New York City cabdriver, never forgot the time he drove the couple from TriBeCa to Grand Central. ""They were both dressed in grungy clothing topped by baseball caps,"" he said. ""They looked like they were on food stamps. They argued the entire trip. It had something to do with Daryl not wanting to accompany John to a political fundraiser of some sort. By the time we reached Grand Central, they were literally shouting at each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere seemed to be a positive correlation between John's misadventures and his relationship with Daryl Hannah. The more dangerous his escapades, the more serious were their arguments. The two were overheard bickering loudly on Fifth Avenue as they approached Jackie Onassis's apartment building. ""Make up your mind,"" JFK Jr. shouted at Daryl. ""Where do you want to go?"" He stormed into the lobby of the building.
Carrying a bag of low-calorie treats from E.A.T., Daryl followed. A moment later they were back on the street, still squabbling. They walked to Madison Avenue and continued their argument in a coffee shop. When they exited, John hailed a cab and jumped in, leaving Daryl behind.‚Äù

1n4b6af,https://www.reddit.com/r/realestateinvesting/comments/1n4b6af/buying_into_a_property_in_newport_beach_california/,Buying into a property in Newport Beach California,"So I have the opportunity to buy into a house that a family member owns and convert it into a rental property in a pretty desirable area about 1 mile from the beach. The area around the neighborhood is pretty industrial, but I've noticed the last few years that they're starting to move out and new small businesses like coffee shops and yoga studios are opening, which I think could improve market value.

Is this a terrible idea? Could you let me know what I am missing or what I should look into? I currently have the cash invested in an S&P500 ETF.

**Property Investment Opportunity**

* **Built around 2020**
* **4 Bedroom, 4 Bath**
* **Property Value**: $1.8M
* **Outstanding Mortgage**: $800K @ 2.5% interest (after taxes and insurance, it's about $5,500/mo)
* **Proposed Investment**: $200K stake
* **Location:** Newport Beach, California

**Ownership Structure**

* Equity = Property value ‚Äì Mortgage = \~$1.0M.
* $200K √∑ $1.0M = **\~20% ownership**.

**Objective**

* Keep this property as a **rental asset**.
* Rental income would service the mortgage and generate equity growth.

  
Note: The current owner resides in the house and will be relocating to a new residence. As far as we know, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the property. It's simply the case that they need the cash to buy a new house and it seems stupid to walk away from a 2.5% mortgage in Newport Beach, a desirable area.

But I saw something very bizarre as I was leaving and Google has not turned anything up and I wonder if anyone else has ever heard of this or has any ideas? 

 I was leaving by the exit on the western side by the Costa coffee and I was passing by the stand with the guard working - not the royal guard, like a regular security person. It was like 5:27 so time to leave. 

Then a normal silver car, not new or anything, something as normal as a Toyota but I didn‚Äôt catch the exact make, was waved through by the security guy and he pressed a button that made the barrier posts move over to the side. I stepped to the side. 

And I watched the car come through. At first I only noticed the driver, just a regular dude. Then I saw what first appeared to be maybe giant dolls but as I kept looking it was clear they were actual people in black morph suits with plain white plastic masks on over the suits. Their heads were bent at a 45 degree angle and they were all not moving I guess to not attract attention?? 

I know how fucking bizarre this sounds but honest to god this is what I saw. I didn‚Äôt drink or do any drugs recently & as far as I know I haven‚Äôt lost touch with reality. Like I said Google turns up nothing. I even asked ChatGPT and it suggested it might be some sort of prank but that doesn‚Äôt make sense bc the car had security clearance. 

Maybe it was an intentionally bizarre security drill? I briefly entertained the idea of them being someone important sneaking in, but as far as I understand, the royals don‚Äôt really frequent the Tower of London and apparently there‚Äôs underground tunnels for access so there‚Äôs no reason for them to do this. 

Anyone have any ideas or have heard of this before? ",5,1756584302.0,london,3,0.86,False

1n4ayhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1n4ayhv/should_you_switch_to_best_laundry_detergent_pacs/,Should You Switch to Best Laundry Detergent Pacs Tide PODS,"Spending months testing Tide 80367560 allowed me to truly understand its strengths and limitations. At first glance, I thought this was just another flashy household product making big promises. However, using it regularly on everything from workout gear to delicate fabrics gave me a fresh perspective. Messy toddler meals, unexpected spills during movie nights, and muddy pet escapades‚Äîthis detergent pac tackled them all. Let me walk you through the highs and lows so you can decide if this product should find a place in your laundry routine.

**Convenience Redefined**  
Using these detergent pods feels like a mini luxury. As someone who has struggled with messy liquid detergents and powder spills, I appreciated the pre-measured pods immediately. With Tide‚Äôs 3-in-1 formula combining a stain remover, odor fighter, and color protector, this product lifts a significant load off your back‚Äîpun intended. Whether it's a big sweater spill or weekly bedding wash, I just toss one pod into the drum and forget about the fuss of measuring. Call me lazy, but this simplicity made an immediate impact on my laundry habits.

**Strengths**  
- **Time-saving and mess-free:** No more fumbling with lids or powders.  
- **Stain dominance:** It‚Äôs no bluff‚ÄîTide easily handled coffee spills, grease stains, and that unexplainable gunk kids seem to attract.  
- **Deep cleaning:** Even heavily soiled clothes come out feeling fresh and looking vibrant.  

**Cleaning Power**  
Being skeptical by nature, I threw every kind of mess at this product. Grass-stained sports uniforms? Check. Baby food explosions? Check. Post-gym stink? Double check. Unlike budget detergents that leave suspicious odors or half-clean patches, Tide lived up to its claim of ""deep clean in one wash"". Even more impressive, it dissolved seamlessly in cold water, making it both effective and energy-efficient. Laundry pods that don't dissolve entirely have frustrated me in the past, but these held their ground, which made my inner neat freak very happy.

**Shortcomings**  
- **Not always cost-friendly:** The packs cost more than liquid detergents if you factor in large loads requiring multiple pods.  
- **Packaging concern:** The childproof container works great for safety but isn't the most environmentally friendly option.  
- **Fragrance preference:** The Original Scent, while fresh, may feel a bit overpowering for those sensitive to smell.  

[Check Tide 80367560 price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b0b9yvg4lr/)  

**Ease of Use for Large Families**  
Laundry for a family of five comes with its unique set of challenges. In our home, everyone has specific preferences‚Äîmy partner often complains about residue from powder detergents, while my eldest insists on a cleaner feel for gym clothes. With these detergent pacs, I stopped hearing complaints. Even with heavy loads, adding an extra pac ensured thorough cleaning, and the clothes smelled uniformly fresh‚Äîa rare win in the parenting department.

**Alternative Offerings**  
While I enjoyed using this product, comparable ones are available in the market. Competitors like Arm & Hammer pods offer a similar combination of cleaning and convenience but don‚Äôt seem to tackle stains as effectively. On the flip side, Gain pods rival Tide with strong fragrances and slightly lower pricing. The major ace up Tide's sleeve is its cold water performance, which makes it superior to rivals. That being said, people with sensitive skin might consider more natural alternatives like Seventh Generation laundry pods. Tide clearly wins when dealing with nasty, oily grease stains‚Äîthose barely stood a chance.

**Value for Money**  
Laundry detergent decisions hinge heavily on price and performance. While Tide 80367560 might strain budgets compared to generic brands, its value lies in unparalleled cleaning efficiency. The concentrated formula means you‚Äôre paying for actual cleaning power rather than watered-down liquid mixes. If energy efficiency and convenience are priorities for you, investing in this product pays off. It‚Äôs worth noting that other ""budget-friendly"" products lose out long-term because you end up using more product per load, essentially evening out the cost difference.

Original List/Post - Updated 08/28

Hi Everyone,

 I hope you won‚Äôt mind that I am asking for your assistance to help our friends at the Coalition to End Homelessness again for the September 1st protest.  They have been working hard at getting 8 units ready to go for unhoused individuals, but they still have two units that they are needing to adopt out.   With your help, I have agreed to sponsor a two room unit that will be the future home of two brothers.

 CCEH is anticipating being able to move individuals into these units the middle of September, and I am hopeful that we can give them a hand in acquiring some basic, but much needed components.  If you‚Äôre like me, perhaps you are able to recall the expenses that came with setting up your brand new space.  If you were lucky like me, you might have even been given a helping hand in this process. 

 In an effort to pay it forward and to help these individuals on their new journey, I am hoping that you will help me collect some very pertinent items:

* Purple (Pay as You Throw) Trash Bags
* Cleaning Supplies ‚Äì Glass Cleaner, Toilet Cleaners, Multi-Surface Cleaners, etc
* Hand Soap
* Dish Soap
* Sponges
* Paper Towels
* Toilet Paper
* Toilet Plunger
* Cooking utensils - specifically: peelers, pizza cutters, spatulas
* Oven Mitts
* Silverware sets (total of 8 settings)
* Medium or large pots (for spaghetti)
* Cookie pans/baking sheets
* Mixing bowls
* Dish drying rack
* Broom with dust pan
* Laundry Detergent

 Nice to have items also include:

* New Bath Garbage Can
* New Bath Towel Set (2)
* New Shower Curtain
* New Shower Liner
* New Laundry Basket (2)
* New Kitchen Towels
* New pot holders
* New Food Storage Containers
* New Kitchen Garbage Can
* New twin Sheet Set (2)
* New pillow (4)
* Throw blankets (4)

 I am still in need of a 42‚Äù round table and a tv for this unit that will be really challenging to collect the day of the protest, but if this is something that you‚Äôd like to donate, please let me know, and I‚Äôll do my absolute best to coordinate with you to make this happen.

 Please note that any monetary donations that are collected the day of will be used to purchase items off the above list as well as a tv, microwave, toaster, and radio, and anything extra will be donated to the Resource Center.  

As always, I will do a transparency post after the event so that you can see what all we collected and if you provided cash, what that went to purchase.  In room set up pictures will be available by September 12.  I will also have a QR code if you would prefer to support them directly financially.

I have a milestone birthday coming up and my family and I would like to visit Europe. We recently visited London and had such a wonderful time! 

My family consist of myself, my wife, and two children ages 2 and 5. We love coffee shops, parks, being outside, swimming, easy hikes, etc. We aren‚Äôt into drinking or partying. We are fine with museums that have places for kids also. 

I have done some research and I feel torn between several destinations. I would love to hear your thoughts.

1. Vienna/Salzburg/Alps: Love the idea of mixing a bit of city experiences with some green spaces and hiking. Just feel a little lost on how to plan this out. Willing to learn some German before traveling. 

2. Copenhagen: Family heritage on both sides. Would love to go here and perhaps take the train up near Fredrickshaven. Legoland for the kids, good food, coffee, etc. I know this is a super pricey destination, so that is the one con on my mind. 

3. France: We have been learning some French. We went to Quebec a few years ago. A little worried about the mixed reviews of France in general. 

4. England: Go back to London and perhaps venture out into other areas. We spent two days in York while we were there last time. Perhaps Bath, Oxford, Cambridge?

The San Francisco Giants (-147) are favored to stomp the Baltimore Orioles (+123) in what promises to be a snoozefest of a game. Why? Because even the most enthusiastic fan might need a coffee IV drip to stay awake through this matchup. Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a middle schooler‚Äôs puns.

### The Giants: ""We‚Äôre Here to Trip on Our Own Bats""

The Giants‚Äô offense is like a broken toaster‚Äîstill functional but not in a good way. They rank 25th in runs (4.1 RPG) and 20th in HRs (136 total). Key hitters like **Rafael Devers** (.258 AVG) and **Jung Hoo Lee** (.323 OBP) are decent, but their combined power output is about as explosive as a wet firecracker. Yet, the Giants‚Äô pitching staff? A 3.70 ERA? That‚Äôs *sixth in MLB*. Go figure.

### The Orioles: ""We‚Äôre Not Dead Yet""

Baltimore‚Äôs offense (4.3 RPG, 18th) is slightly less anemic, thanks to **Gunnar Henderson** (

I had to grind much finer (7‚Äì8 on Encore ESP) compared to other freshly roasted coffees where I normally grind 10‚Äì12+ this soon after roast.

The Harris Borax Powder Laundry Booster and Multipurpose Cleaner, 1.5lb, has quickly become one of my go-to cleaning essentials. I‚Äôve used it extensively for everything from laundry loads to kitchen scrubbing, and I have a lot to share about how well it performs and where it might not be perfect. As someone managing a household and keen on efficient solutions that actually work, I was intrigued by this product's promise of handling tough stains and multipurpose utility. It‚Äôs a product I‚Äôve been testing for weeks, and I can confidently share both its winning points and potential issues.

**Stain-Fighting Capabilities**  
What initially drew me to this product was its claim to boost the power of any detergent. Testing it on heavily stained clothes‚Äîfrom coffee spills to grass marks on my kids‚Äô soccer uniforms‚Äîyielded impressive results. Paired with my regular detergent, it seemed to significantly lift the dirt, leaving clothes noticeably brighter. The neutralization of odors was an added bonus, especially with gym clothes. A single scoop dissolved effortlessly in the washer, without any residue on fabrics after the wash. Its compatibility with hard water also stood out, as my area notoriously struggles with mineral buildup, and this helped balance it out beautifully.

[Check Harris Borax Powder Laundry Booster and Multipurpose Cleaner, 1.5lb price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b0bgynrjnm/)

**DIY Cleaning Solution Enthusiasts Take Note**  
As someone who dabbles in creating homemade cleaning recipes, this product became an instant staple. Crafting simple scrubbing pastes or an all-purpose spray with the powder worked like a charm on everything from grease-caked stovetops to soap-scum-ridden shower tiles. It didn‚Äôt disappoint when used on my kitchen counters and even helped clean out carpet stains effectively. The powder‚Äôs unscented formula made it incredibly versatile; I could use it across multiple surfaces without leaving behind any overpowering chemical smell.

**User-Friendly Features**  
Convenience can make or break a product for me, and this laundry booster understood the assignment. The inclusion of a measuring scoop, cleverly nestled inside, made dosing straightforward and spot-on. Additionally, the resealable packaging was a thoughtful touch, keeping the powder fresh and preventing moisture from clumping it up. You‚Äôd think something as minor as a resealable zipper wouldn‚Äôt be a game-changer, but when you‚Äôre juggling multiple cleaning tasks, it‚Äôs one less thing to worry about.

**Benefits**  
- Boosts detergent efficacy for laundry.  
- Works effectively in hard water areas.  
- Ideal for crafting homemade cleaning solutions.  
- Conveniently designed packaging with a resealable bag and measuring scoop.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Like any cleaning product, this one isn‚Äôt without its limitations. For one, the product doesn‚Äôt dissolve as quickly in cold water. On colder days, I found myself needing to switch to warm or hot settings for optimal performance. Additionally, though the unscented formula was great for sensitive skin, there were moments where I missed having a subtle, fresh fragrance post-cleanup. Lastly, while it works wonders on laundry and household surfaces, it failed to tackle tougher mildew spots in my bathroom as effectively as specialized mildew-focused products do.  

- Struggles to dissolve fully in cold water.  
- Lacks a fragrant boost for those who prefer scented cleaning solutions.  
- Slightly less effective on mildew-heavy surfaces.

**Competing Products**  
In a landscape filled with similar options, it‚Äôs essential to note how this stacks up. Comparatively, products like OxiClean Versatile Stain Remover or Seventh Generation Oxygen Bleach Powder have a stronger scent or more aggressive stain removal chemicals. That said, this powder shines for those aiming for more natural, unscented solutions. OxiClean, in particular, offers excellent stain-removal strength but often contains more noticeable chemical additives. On the other hand, if you solely require a laundry-specific assistant, certain detergents with built-in boosters might save you the additional step.  

Where the Harris Borax Powder really stands out is its dual use as a laundry booster and general cleaning agent. Competing cleaners don‚Äôt always offer this level of flexible functionality. Safety-conscious families or individuals will also appreciate its fragrance-free formula, which stands in contrast to harsher chemical products in the same category.

**Value Proposition**  
When discussing the overall value, it‚Äôs fair to state that this powder strikes an excellent balance between effectiveness and cost. You won‚Äôt need excessive amounts to see results, making the bag last a decent while. Its multi-functionality reduces the need for buying various specialized cleaners, providing additional bang for the buck. It won‚Äôt solve every cleaning problem, and there‚Äôs room for improvement on specific cleaning challenges, but for its price range, it‚Äôs hard to beat.

We've been together 2 years and have lived together the entire time. We had known each other for 2 years prior, and I was a traveling dancer at the time we got together. He knew what I did for work, didn't care. I left the job and the one lined up after to move back to be with him and leave the industry forever. I stayed with him and friends until he told me I could stay full time... I never got a key

I worked from 8 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon and he went to work at 3 and came back at 11. So I would sit in a park or bars for hours. That went on for about 2 months until I got a new job and he let me use his. One day, recently, it came up and he said he'd thought I moved in too quickly. When I asked why he didn't just say that, he said he didn't want me to live with other men - my previous roommates were men and the friend I was staying with was a man

He made about 3√ó what I did at the time, so I paid ‚Öì of the rent and cleaned everything. Seemed fair at the time and his cleaning skills were subpar

Fast forward to present day... we work the same hours, only I out earn him. I pay half of the bills. I clean the entire house and when it comes up he mentions how I had told him he ""doesn't do it right"" and I explained that he can't halfway try and he brushed me off saying I told him not to, and I did... when he paid ‚Öî off the bills and paid for every dinner we had out. Now we both work 60 hours a week, and he gets to do nothing his 2 days off and one of my 2 is dedicated to cleaning up his messes - he left a dirty bowl on the coffee table on his day off Monday, covered it with a towel because he knows we have an ant problem that I had just gotten under control, and left it until I picked it up Friday. It was full of ants. I sobbed because he wouldn't put cups in the sink and he finally did it about 2 weeks after that issue

We want to buy a house, he isn't saving for it and when asked recently how much he has for the house stated he ""doesn't know"" because he ""doesn't have a savings account."" So I'm doing all the saving for that

He spends at his money on Legos. We have an entire room for Legos and when I bring up saving, he defaults to the Legos make him happy

I bring up marriage and he says we haven't been together long enough, and when I being up a child, he's wishy-washy. One day he's happy talking about names, the next he says he's not sure about it

I have never spoken to his parents, not even on the phone. He won't tell me about his childhood other than random tidbits and ""we were poor"" but not turn the oven on and open the door to heat the house poor. They address cards to us, I've read a few where his mother mentions seeing us or meeting me and he won't make plans to, say his parents are too sick and can't or just asks why I want to talk to them so badly?

He loves the cat more than he does me at this point! He won't say he loves me without me saying it, it's like negotiating with a terrorist to get him to kiss me and forget sex, it's been a month and if we have it twice a month, that's a great month! It's been like that for a year... He said it's because we're both busy with work or he's tired or doesn't feel good about himself and I understand but he doesn't even try anymore and I gave up because he rejects me 50% of the time so it didn't feel worth it

My boss (32M) is getting married this week and I asked how long they'd been together, he said the same time my boyfriend and I have been. I asked how long they were engaged and he said 1 year. 1 year dating, 1 year engaged. I asked what made him decide to ask her to marry him at the 1 year mark and he said he ""couldn't wait any longer to start his life with her"" and that he ""knew she was the one so why waste any more time?"" I told him my boyfriend and I had been together 2 years. He gave me a look and went back to work. IT TOOK A YEAR for my boyfriend to say he loved me and within that year, he's stopped

I asked why he loves me recently and he said ""I don't know, you make me happy"" and wouldn't elaborate like I do when asked. He called me mean the other day when I was frustrated with the cat he loves more than me peeing on the floor for the 3rd time this week, and then immediately bypassing 2 scratching posts to destroy the couch a little more

When I try to bring up hard topics about us, he deflects. He asked last night at 3 the morning what was wrong, and I couldn't articulate at that moment that I wasn't sure about our future, it's 3 in the morning and I'm not a middle of the night argument person

I want a family! A house, a husband, a baby! I feel like a fucking housekeeper! Even Arnold Schwarzenegger gave his maid a baby!

From a male brain, is he keeping me around because it's easier than the alternatives? What's the logic? Does he actually love me or is it just attachment at this point?

Anybody, what would you do? How do I start that conversation to ask if he sees a future and its not just empty words to shut me up?",1,1756582301.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

My husband and I have been TTC for a year - never had a positive test. I‚Äôve had painful periods since I‚Äôve gotten my period but always have had a regular cycle. Doctors always told me my pain was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and I‚Äôve tried various remedies over the years to help alleviate the pain (yoga, matcha instead of coffee, etc). 
Anyway, during the ultrasound at our consult, we learned I had 20+ follicles in each ovary. My ovarian reserve bloodwork came back high as well. Still waiting on some additional testing but I guess I have PCOS. It‚Äôs a little validating to have an answer as to why my periods have been so painful (mainly the first 1-2 days). I did struggle with acne a lot in young adulthood as well as oily skin, plus I always gain weight in my belly, which are other symptoms. I‚Äôm about to turn 32 now.

This is my first review... And actually the first fiction book I've made it through in over a decade.

I have Irlen syndrome, a learning disability similar to dyslexia, and that combined with school really crushed any love of reading that might have existed in me.

Fast forward to a couple of months ago. I started posting about my bookbinding on different social media platforms and as I started to follow and be followed by more and more book people I started to feel really insecure. Like I was an imposter and everyone would inevitably discover my dirty secret... That I'm a book binder who doesn't really love books ü´£

Before long this sense of insecurity morphed into a kind of jealousy. I could see the very real joy, comfort, and creativity that reading brought all of my newfound friends... And I wanted a part of that.

I discussed this desire to try reading again with my brother and some other friends and after a bit of back and forth we settled on something cozy and not too ambitious - Legends & Lattes. (It helped that I'm a coffee addict too!! üòÖ)

At the time I was embroidering a cover for a separate project so it made sense to listen to the book via audiobook and I'm glad I did because Travis is a wonderful narrator and helped me stay immersed in the story. The 7 hours flew past and left me wanting more!

I wrote a small review as part of a video I made about this book and during the research phase I found a couple of reviews saying the book was boring and that nothing happens but I disagree. In place of developing a complicated web of plots you have to maintain in your mind or fleshing out and ever expanding universe - Legends & Lattes devotes most of its pages to building the relationships between characters which is something I found very wholesome and gave the story a real richness.

It's these relationships you build with the characters in your mind that somewhat undermine the ""low stakes"" claim on the front cover. The more you care about these characters, the more genuine your concern is when the crisis arises, and the more genuine the relief you feel is once the story finds it's resolution. It's not some planet consuming evil by any means but because Travis has made the book about these characters, they become the world - and you don't want this world to end.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it was a lovely book to start me off on my reading adventures. I'm very much looking forward to diving into more literary worlds as my confidence in reading grows.

Reviewing this book has been a fun exercise for me and I'd love some feedback because I think I'll try doing reviews more often. Do you have any tips or things I could improve on? Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è",23,1756582097.0,Fantasy,6,0.96,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/s/5bvS9SulnC


I ended up going on a solo-trip to Istanbul üáπüá∑ after my summer internship for 6 days. I got to see so many cool things and wanted to share with all of you the stuff to check out if you plan on going to Istanbul. I saw the Hagia Sofia,  Blue Mosque, Sultanahmet Square, Istanbul Archaeology Museums, Topkapi Palace & the harem, Basilica Cistern, Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazaar, Maiden's Tower, Galata Tower, Istiklal Street, Dolmabah√ße Palace, and the Panorama 1453 History Museum. I went on a Bosphorus ferry tour. Explored both European and Asian sides of Istanbul. As for food, under the Galata Bridge I tried Balik Ekmek. Other foods I ate were Menemen, Pide, various Kebabs like Adana kebabƒ±, Lamb Shank, Turkish Delight, Baklava, Katmer, and some other Turkish desserts. 

Tried some classic drinks like √áay, Turkish Coffee, and Boza from Vefa Bozacƒ±sƒ±. 

Some really good restaurants I recommend are:

Deraliye Restaurant, Inci Pastanesi, Nova Santiye Cafe, and unbeatable views from Seven Hills Restaurant. 

I went to go get a haircut from a Turkish barber who uses flames to singe your hair. Also highly recommend a Turkish Hammam. You feel very clean afterwards. The Hodjapasha Whirling Dervish Ceremony was a very cool experience as well. Pick up baklava boxes for your friends and family from Hafiz Mustafa 1864. 


If I had to put out one warning it would be mindful of the carpet stores. I bought a Turkish rug from a store for $400. I made sure to authenticate it before buying and understand the pricing based on it being silk vs wool, hand made versus machine made, country of origin, and based on dimensions. If you‚Äôre unsure, upload pictures of the carpet into chatgpt and it'll be more accurate than your own judgement on it if you're completely unsure. Also be mindful of price gougers. I went to Vefa Bozacƒ±sƒ± and the front guy tried to convince me it was ‚Ç¨7 for Boza when the sign said 60TL. Had I not caught the sign, he would have ripped me off. 


Overall, my second experience solo-travelling has helped a lot with navigating confrontations and confidence with standing your ground while being open to unexpected experiences. The people there have been so kind and welcoming. I was handed around 10-15 free apple teas and fruits like watermelon from shop owners and restaurants while passing by. Be open to conversations with strangers. I had the chance to talk with people from Syria and Iran who were immigrants, telling me about their experiences in Turkey. This trip alone has helped me understand myself more and my role being shaped by my environment, growing up in the U.S. It makes you more appreciative of your life circumstances and the people around you who care about you, family and friends. I came back with more confidence in navigating things independently while knowing when to consult others.

I highly recommend checking out Istanbul, but like any country, keep your wits, be mindful, and socially aware of your surroundings.",1,1756582004.0,solotravel,0,1.0,False

I have a burr grinder coming and I have been using one that doesn't have very good grind control settings for a long time to make our pot of coffee. The one that's coming is a lot more professional grade and it has grind settings that are much easier to use. With that tool in hand and knowing that I at least know the theory of pulling an espresso shot is the actual process and maintenance something fairly simple?

1n4a9m9,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1n4a9m9/narcissistic_mother_giving_me_silent_treatment/,Narcissistic mother giving me silent treatment,"So last year my stepfather (not a narc but controlling and abusive) had an almighty row with me - from his side. I simply set and held valid boundaries. It culminated with him reminding me yet again what a vile kid I'd been and this time I replied that I wasnt, I was acting normally for a child subjected to physical abuse and emotional abuse and neglect. 

He then blew his lid, demanded I apologise and retract what I said otherwise he would pass my emails to my mother. I held my ground. He passed the emails to her.

My mother then contacted my husband telling him how deeply worried about me she was because I was ""the most insane she'd ever seen me"". He replied to say that I was absolutely fine and that she and her husband should think long and hard about what they were saying before contacting either of us again.

For info, I was the healthiest emotionally ive ever been, I had started setting and holding healthy boundaries with her about a year or so before.

My stepfather started sending me demands that we put the fight behind us - i ignored him. He then apologised and said we should put the fight behind us. I agreed.

I acted as though nothing was wrong because nothing was wrong for me. I was fed up with them, but was really strong and resourced and so was able to be in touch.

My mother refused to speak to me. I had an important letter re a gift she had given me I needed to get off her, she had promised to send it for two years and kept not - then claiming she had sent it. She ignored my emails politely asking for it. Finally I said me and my husband needed the letter - the letter arrived and as part of the legal letter she proclaimed the gift had been given with love.

She later sent me an email saying it was my nieces birthday. I politely replied to say thank you and that I had remembered amd hoping she was well. Nothing back.

Then 6 months after her bs letter to my husband i got a birthday card with her having written in it, let's walk out of the dark into the light together. As I wasnt in any dark and there wasnt anything particular to reply to, and as she hadnt even acknowledged or mentioned a card I'd drawn and painted for Christmas I ignored the card.

She then got ill. I phoned to ask to speak to her. My stepfather said that was a good idea but she was asleep. I phoned back a day or so later. He tried to get her to take it but she with a pathetic voice said she wasnt up to speaking to me. I politely said fine and tell her I love her and hope she's OK.

Then a few months later at Christmas she emails. She'd like to see me please come to the house. I said that would be nice and gave her two dates and times I could come.

We arrived. She had invited close family friends at the same time (who she'd seen two days before on boxing day and who she'd also spend Christmas day with). I was delighted. Meant we didnt have to speak to her.

She was vile to the little boy - he jokingly sat in ""her"" chair and wouldn't move when she demanded it back and she went apeshit at him.

The other family made to leave about 2-3 hrs later and we said we were leaving too. She got upset as we hadnt opened our presents from her (we didnt bring any presents for her). We stayed long enough to politely open our presents thanked them nicely and left.

I then sent her an email a couple weeks later to invite her out for coffee with my husband and me. We never meet outside of her or my house, but with her having had people over when I came to visit (also something in all my years shes never done) i decided that that was fine and I didn't want her at mine nor did I want to go to hers. I wanted the boundary of a neutral and commercial space.

We met. It was fine. As we left she said that I must come out to theirs. I saud sonething vaguely non committal about my husband being very busy so perhaps but unlikely.

Since then I then sent one email to my whole family about something funny, specifically checking in with my parents on how they were. My stepfather replied to say they were fine.

I then decided that I wanted to go no contact. Being in contact with my mother over the years has been a lottery of her being saccharine sweet then doing or saying the nastiest things that she proclaims im overreacting to. It takes its toll. They hit. Hard. And it takes me a long time to recover.

Ive got into a number of communities that deeply support and show love and care to me and ive decided I dont want the impact of her behaviour any longer.

That was January this year.

I got all my emails forwarded to my husband so I cant tell if shes been in touch.

Today I heard from my brother my narc father died yesterday. No biggie. I went no contact years ago and last year it looked like he was dying and I decided not to visit and came into resolution that I wouldn't see him again and that in time he would die.

But, it made me feel differently about my mother. We've had a very different relationship to me and my narc father which has been solely abuse and coercion and plain nastiness for all my life.

So I asked my husband if my mother had been in touch.

Apparently shes been giving me the silent treatment since January..... (laughing)...

It appears that me setting, and holding healthy boundaries, refusing to be coerced and suckered into her games means she cant cope and so has booted me out her life.

She has told me all my life, that the abuse and emotional neglect she has inflicted on me is my fault. I asked her when she gave up on me. She replied without a pause to say I was 8 years old. Ive been told that my stepfather is glad im not his child because if I were he'd have to love me and im unlovable. She told me as a child that everytime I told her I hated her that chipped away at her love for me.

She would kick me out the house if I got upset about anything. But also, when a pet of mine died and I didn't tell her - because I couldn't cope with her landing her emotions on me - she found out 6 weeks later. She gave me this woeful oh im SO SORRY for you, you must be distraught. I replied that I was OK because it was 6 weeks ago and id grieved she screamed at me that well SHE HAD ONLY JUST FOUND OUT.... (I was sad but I wasnt going to show her). And it was long enough before that i was able to hold the sadness in. 

I'm realising that I had no chance to be a healthy child. She didn't want a healthy child, that set healthy boundaries, showed appropriate emotions and was appropriately open. Because I now am..... and according to her I'm insane..... figures....",2,1756581969.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

1n4a90g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1n4a90g/the_ethical_isekai_of_izuku_midoriya/,The Ethical Isekai of Izuku Midoriya,"This occurs after canon chapter 429, sometime early in the third year of Class A's time at UA. Things appear to be going normal with everyone in the dorms that most people are staying in during the week. Izuku is his normal self, casually walking out of the kitchen with his morning coffee when a strange teal portal appears in front of him. Before anyone can react or warn him, he walks through the portal and onto the other side. Nothing appears wrong with him to anyone watching this occur, and he feels fine, but the problem is immediately obvious. Walking right next to him is a perfect clone of Izuku Midoriya. The clone freaks out, throws the sports drink it was holding and asks what is going on. The class is confused for a few seconds before getting into motion to try and contain the situation. This is quickly interrupted as the teal portal suddenly moves, engulfing the clone of Izuku Midoriya and dissipating leaving no evidence that it was ever there. The class is thoroughly confused and asks if Midoriya knows what the hell just happened, but he is clueless as well.

With the clone, he suddenly reappears in the Support Course labs on a weird slab of technology. He quickly realizes he is not alone, as Mei Hatsume and Momo Yaoyorozu are standing nearby in obvious joy. He is suddenly tackled by Mei with a giant hug, knocking him over as she is crying into him. Momo is also wet in the eyes, but calmly offers him a hand to stand up. He inquires as to what is going on, getting context clues from Mei saying 'She thought she'd never see him again.' Momo explains that they had used technology Mei had been building since before she entered UA to summon him to their world, a multiverse dimension portal. They used a portal to create two of him in his universe with a minor fork split (coffee versus sports drink) and grabbed the secondary version of him before it could dissipate in the lost sands of time where all unrealized choices go. And now he was there in the stable other-verse, to help fill the void of their Izuku Midoriya who died defeating Shigaraki/AfO more than a year before.

From here, the prompt has a lot of ways it could go. A crux of the idea is that the world is mostly the same, but with a few key differences. I imagined things like Bakugo and Gran Torino dying, All might going by Superman instead, Touya having a powerful ice quirk and he was the one who went into mental hospital after scarring Shoto (who otherwise had a tough but not abusive life) Dabi is replaced by Burnin in the League of Villians, as she was a sidekick that killed a civilian under Endeavor's watch and he got her kicked out of heroing. Eri is named Sakura and has pink hair, and maybe a few characters are gender flipped. There is a lot of ways you could explain how Izuku died and they won the war. I imagined AfO was successful in overtaking Tomura, and Izuku made the hard decision to bait AfO with offering his quirk for peace. He secretly gave the quirk to one of his classmates before hand, and gave himself up. AfO is pleased...until he realizes it isn't working and realizes what happened. He flips out and proceeds to fight Izuku to the death, only to be held in place as Monoma appears to erase his quirks long enough for Momo to blow him to smithereens with a super effective bazooka. It could also be Stain or the Man of Steel (alt Armored Might), but it would be up to you. The quirk could also be held by anyone you choose, but I imagined it being Mineta because I imagined it would force him to grow so this Izuku would be surprised to see Mineta is now almost normal height and looks like a hollywood teenager.

From there, it is just a fun story where you have canon Izuku adapt to a world almost like his own but not quite, and have fun and silly romances in it (it is a isekai) I'm posting it for whoever needs a prompt, because I sure won't ever get around to writing it.",1,1756581926.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,1.0,False

This morning I ran a side-by-side with my trusty X-Ultra.

Coffee: Lore (pictured) & Clarity (no pic - Burundi Cassien Nibaruta - Natural Process - Blackberry | Cherry | Peach)

Grind size: Tried to match, but the A4Z ended up slightly coarser. I was aiming for finer (~1.2.0 on the X-Ultra).

Water temp: 210¬∞F

Ratio: 1:18 (15.2 g : 274 g)

Pour: 75s bloom, then 2 pours with the MeloDrip

Brew time: Forgot to note, but the A4Z finished faster.

Taste:
My wife picked the A4Z both times, and liked it even more as the cups cooled.

I also picked the A4Z on both coffees. As they cooled, I thought the Clarity coffee on the X-Ultra came very close to the A4Z.

For context: I‚Äôve had Clarity dialed in on the X-Ultra and have been enjoying it daily. Lore was a first-time brew.

Question for other A4Z owners:
I‚Äôm still not confident about the zeroing process. On the X-Ultra, it‚Äôs obvious‚ÄîI can clearly feel/see zero. On the A4Z, the adjustment felt firmer and harder to judge, and when I ‚Äúzeroed‚Äù it, it didn‚Äôt look as flush as the X-Ultra. Mine ended up only 2 clicks from the factory setting, so I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve got it right. Any tips?

So I got to know this guy online, At first I didnt reply to his first dm as I wasnt interested but he double texted me so I replied and we started talking, obv we were talking in thr intention of developing it into a rs not jst to get to know each other out of boredom, after few days he vanished in the middle of an important conversation for like 4 days, I got mad and texted him , he apologized and told me that he was about to reply but his laggage got lost at the aireport as he was going to do Umrah with his mother and sister (we are muslims) that was at the very first days of the talking stage, he told me that he bought me a personnalized gift with my name on it and wants to meet me right after he comes back ,  we came back talking again and getting to know each other and we seemed compatible in many aspects (religion, future vision, how we wanna raise our kids , how we perceive marriage etc), then suddenly he dissapeard again for 3 days, when he texted me I didnt answer until the day after , he told me that he hates small talk texting (even tho the topics we were talking about were really important as we both were serious about the rs stuff) , I expressed that me myself hate being replied to after many days, he often tells me that he hates that his partner be ""emotionally dependent""  on him and that drains the life out of him (wtf) , I  gave him solid arguments like ""If I didnt get the attention or care from my partner what makes him different than any other man? jst the label of a rs? and how would I know that he truly wants me or even interested in me if he doesnt check on me often? etc) he couldnt reply as my arguments were solid and said you are right I have nothing to say, another time he told me that's not a healthy rs if the couple are always in touch as that fascination and attachement fades with time and only the understanding lasts (as if true love doesnt come with understanding) and said that he expresses his interest or love with gifts and gestures but doesnt want to text , also he said that he is a super top nonchalant man .

At the beginning when I expressed that I hate being replied to after days and he said what type of guys he is, told him that I wont force him to change i.e. if you know that you can't deal with who I am you are free to go, but he started talking to me daily and flirting with me and istg I wasnt even a bit clingy, I wasn't showing that much of interest but he was the one that he did it all, the last two days when he came back from umrah he was spending the nights out at the coffee shops with his friends until like 4 or 5 a.m , he only reacts to my dms and says have a good night, I once replied with ""that's it? okay gn"" and probably that was the only time I felt like am being clingy or idk.

3 days later, he told me "" ik am not showing as much interest as you (indeed he was üò≠) but I can""t really click with someone through texting, but with time we can meet and grow on each other until marriage or engagement at least, does that work with you"" and gave him solid arguments aagain like "" we already live far away from each other so at best we will meet each other once a month, am I getting the attzntion or care from my partner once a month?? "" he told me that in his previous rs they were both independent and only talk casually without nagging with trust and was the best and he is looking for something similar (after buying me gifts and already knowing what kind of person I am) and what I am demanding isnt the kind of healthy long lasting rs, i replied "" so we cover the distance with more distance? and how would we got engaged if we really didnt get to know each other as we should?"" 
After these two texts he vanished, usually when he does it doesnt happen in the middle of the convo , but after saying gk or good bye, but this topic was serious, and he, disrespectfully left me on read, I was waiting for a reply to discuss more and see if there is a middle solution or at least we meet first then we see the advanced stages.

After few hours I asked him if everything is okay, online with no reply, texted him tmrw if we will continue discussing or not, he opens whatsapp with no reply, i got mad so i sent him a closure dms (for my peace of mind) told him if you are not interested anym you could jsr say so instead of leaving me on read cuz this isnt nonchalance anym this is disrespect , still no reply even tho he uses ig anf open whatsapp, he viewed the dms the day after with no reply still , 

today , out of curiosity, i asked him why did you invest in a gift and flirted with me often and aqked me out if you were gonna ghost me in the end? Well I don't have to tell you what was his reply bcz he didnt reply ü§°",0,1756581829.0,ghosting,0,0.5,False

1n4a6qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTechTakes/comments/1n4a6qi/should_you_trust_the_best_external_ssd_sandisk/,Should You Trust the Best External SSD SanDisk Extreme Portable,"The SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD caught my attention when I needed a reliable storage solution that could handle both extensive content creation and hefty video files. Having used it almost daily for the last two months, I've had plenty of opportunities to assess its capabilities and quirks. The model I‚Äôm reviewing is the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD, and it‚Äôs safe to say it has changed my digital workflow remarkably, though not without a few minor things to note.

**Compact Design That's Travel-Ready**  
The first thing I noticed was its size. This device is offering both portability and style in one very compact package. Its dimensions (7 x 5 x 2 inches) and weight (10.6 ounces) make it incredibly easy to slip into a laptop bag or even a jacket pocket. The inclusion of a silicon rubber shell adds a premium feel, but, more importantly, it enhances durability. Sporting a rugged build, it‚Äôs clear this little drive was made with adventure in mind. I took it on a recent road trip, and it withstood constant jostling and the occasional accidental drop onto hard surfaces without a scratch.

**Rugged Performance in Unfriendly Conditions**  
While working outdoors, especially on video shoots at the beach, I was grateful for its IP55 rating for water and dust resistance. Sand, ocean mist, and even a clumsy coffee spill barely fazed it. The two-meter drop protection also felt reassuring on days when everything seemed to fall out of my hands. It truly seems built for creators who find inspiration in unpredictable environments.  

[Check SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD price on Amazon.](https://preciseshop.com/p/b0csprksyn/)  

**Blazing Speeds That Transform Workflow**  
Speed was the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD's biggest promise, and the specs were not just for show. With up to 1050MB/s read and 1000MB/s write speeds over a USB 3.2 Gen 2 connection, my video editing workflow became noticeably faster. Transferring large 4K video files took mere minutes. To test it thoroughly, I moved a 60GB folder filled with raw footage‚Äîit completed transfer faster than any other external storage I currently own. This is, hands-down, one of the standout features for me, as I often face tight deadlines and need gear that can keep up.  

**Advanced Security for Your Files**  
Another highlight is the built-in 256-bit AES password protection. For someone as paranoid about data security as I am, this feature was an absolute game-changer. I work with sensitive client files regularly, and knowing they‚Äôre safe, even if the SSD were misplaced, adds peace of mind. Setting up the password was straightforward, thanks to the intuitive software included with the SSD. My colleague, who‚Äôs not particularly tech-savvy, got hers going without so much as a single Google search.  

**Includes Practical Accessories**  
One of the thoughtful touches was the bundled carabiner loop and sleek protective carrying case. I attached the drive to my backpack while exploring some rugged terrain for a landscape photography workshop. It made carrying the drive easy and accessible without the usual digging around in a bag. I also appreciated the USB-C to USB-A adapter included in the box, as it worked seamlessly to connect to older machines still using traditional USB ports.  

**Good Points**  
- Exceptional transfer speeds drastically cut down file waiting time.  
- Rugged build that handles drops, dust, and water exposure.  
- Compact design with convenient travel-friendly accessories.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The IP55 protection is water-resistant, but submerging it in water is still not advisable.  
- Its silicon shell, though durable, attracts dust and lint more than I‚Äôd prefer.  
- If you‚Äôre not using a Gen 2 USB port, speeds will lower, so not everyone will get the full benefit.

**Competitive Options**  
While this portable SSD excels in many areas, there are rivals worth considering, like the Samsung T7 Shield. Compared to the SanDisk, the T7 offers similar read/write speeds but with better heat management, which might matter during prolonged data transfers. However, the rugged durability of the SanDisk edges out Samsung‚Äôs offering, especially in harsher environments. The LaCie Rugged SSD is another option, renowned for its enterprise-grade durability, but it comes at a heftier price tag for similar capacity. Ultimately, SanDisk strikes a commendable balance between performance and affordability.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
I would argue that this SSD offers tremendous quality for the price. While it isn‚Äôt the cheapest option in the market, every dollar spent goes toward a well-thought-out design and optimal performance. Considering its lightning-fast speeds, rugged features, and included security enhancements, the value is clear. I‚Äôve shelled out more for devices in the past that couldn‚Äôt hold a candle to this one in terms of abilities and durability. Its 5-year warranty only sweetens the deal, offering extra assurance of long-term use.

Would love if you shared your ideas too :)
Also sorry the text is a bit longer than usual!

Each cog department would have a theme corresponding to its facilities and HQ‚Äôs looks. 

First Floor (Lobby):
	‚Ä¢	Sellbot: Factory styled lobby with plants, conveyor belts, and crates.

	‚Ä¢	Cashbot: Bank lobby with money bags, sofas, vases, and a marble floor.

	‚Ä¢	Lawbot: Roman-style lobby with columns, sofas, and gavels, similar to the CLO lobby and the lawfices.

	‚Ä¢	Bossbot: Classic office reception with desks, chairs, a green carpet, and brown walls, resembling the CEO lobby.

	‚Ä¢	Boardbot (HQ is still not out!): Modern, grey lobby with glass walls, sofas, coffee tables, and a front desk, with a carpet leading to the elevator.



Floors 2‚Äì5:
	‚Ä¢	Sellbot: Factory-like floors with assembly lines and crates.

	‚Ä¢	Cashbot: Floors filled with stacks of cash, coin counters, desks where Cogs work on finances, and security cameras (decorative only).

	‚Ä¢	Lawbot: Mini courtrooms with desks, bookshelves, gavels, and statues.

	‚Ä¢	Bossbot: Office floors with brown walls, green carpet, large windows (showing a grey/dark sky), desks, lamps, cabinets, and plants.

	‚Ä¢	Boardbot: Large grey meeting rooms with long tables, spinning chairs, digital stock market screens, and cameras (these ones move around and deal damage).




Final Floor:
	‚Ä¢	Sellbot: A foreman-style office with decor like a desk, some stompers and robotic machines acting like cheats for the boss/other cogs, and a conveyor belt spawning new cogs instead of an elevator. 

	‚Ä¢	Cashbot: A huge CFO lobby inspired office with the boss‚Äôs desk and a cash register on it. A large dollar symbol with a nearby screen showing which currency is stronger (jellybeans vs. dollars), functioning as a cheat.

	‚Ä¢	Lawbot: A grand courtroom with a podium for the judge and jury, statues and lights, and twin gavels that strike the toons as a cheat.

	‚Ä¢	Bossbot: An executive office with a massive desk, oversized chair, vases, paintings and lamps, kinda similar to the Director‚Äôs office.

	‚Ä¢	Boardbot: A big boardroom with steps leading to a large meeting table (the largest chair for the boss). Huge windows overlook the street and a dark/dull sky. Giant stock market screens track rising and falling shares, serving as the floor‚Äôs cheat.",2,1756581517.0,Toontown,6,1.0,False

1n49zfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n49zfi/ms_mystery_suspense/,[MS] Mystery Suspense,"I had an intense dream which made me write that story. A hotel where all the guests have unfinished duties and no one quiet unerstands why they're there...

Hotel of Unfinished business

I cannot remember how I arrived.
One moment, there was only a street, narrow and ordinary, lined with pale facades and shuttered shops. The evening sun pressed soft warmth into the air, that late-summer, early-autumn glow that makes the shadows longer, more forgiving. And then, without transition, I was standing before the hotel.
It was a modest building, three stories tall, with a neon sign buzzing faintly above the door. Not grand, not shabby‚Äîjust the kind of place a tired traveler might choose because it promised nothing more than a bed, a shower, and breakfast. The kind of hotel you forget the moment you leave it. I stepped inside.
The lobby was clean, though not new. A pair of couches faced each other across a low table scattered with old magazines. A pot plant leaned toward the dim light of a single window. A faint hum from the ceiling lamps filled the silence.
Ahead of me, another guest was just finishing check-in. Beside him stood a large, fuzzy dog, tail wagging happily as it leaned against its owner‚Äôs leg. The manager reached down to scratch its head before handing over the room key, as if dogs were the most ordinary of hotel guests.
Behind the reception desk stood a man in a dark suit. His tie was wider than fashion demanded, his jacket slightly long in the sleeves, yet he wore it with a kind of dignity, as though he had been greeting guests in that same attire for decades. His hair was neatly combed back, his smile polite, but his eyes never quite met mine. 
‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù he said in a practiced voice. ‚ÄúChecking in?‚Äù
I nodded before I could think.
He slid a thick logbook toward me, the kind with yellowed pages and fraying edges. As I bent to sign my name, my gaze caught the entries: rows upon rows of signatures, many repeating, some crossed out, others fading into the paper as if written years apart by the same hand. My breath caught when I saw my own name already there, scrawled in slightly different handwriting, several times over. The manager did not comment. He only turned the logbook back to himself, closed it carefully, and reached for a brass key.
‚ÄúGuests also help with small duties. It‚Äôs part of the arrangement here. Nothing demanding, just a little order to keep things running. Emptying bins, taking the reception desk at night for an hour, room service in another guest‚Äôs room, or cleaning a window or two. There‚Äôs a list posted in the hallway‚Äîyou sign your name, pick a time. Most find it easy enough.‚Äù
I must have looked surprised, because he smiled faintly. ‚ÄúIt works well. Everyone contributes, everyone benefits. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù
He stepped out from behind the desk and gestured for me to follow. Together we climbed the stairs, the old carpet muffling our steps. The corridors were long, lined with numbered doors.
As we walked, he went on: ‚ÄúAt night, each guest takes a turn at the reception desk. Just an hour‚Äîit helps keep things orderly. As I mentioned, you‚Äôll find a sign-up list in the hallway, same as for the other duties. The desk must never be left unattended after midnight. If anyone comes to the door at that hour, you don‚Äôt check them in. You simply wait. Do nothing, say nothing, and eventually they leave.""
We stopped before a door marked 214. He placed the key in my hand, his fingers cold, almost too steady.
Inside, the room was plain: a neatly made bed, a small desk, curtains drawn against the fading daylight. It looked ready for me, though I couldn‚Äôt recall having booked it.
The manager lingered a moment longer in the doorway. ‚ÄúSettle in,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand soon enough.‚Äù Then he gave the same polite nod he must have given thousands of guests before me and walked back down the hall.

The next morning, I followed the smell of coffee down to the dining hall.
Breakfast had begun, though the room was nearly empty. Two men in suits sat apart from one another, nursing cups of coffee as though they had been at it for hours. A woman in a grey cardigan picked at a piece of toast while a small terrier dozed beneath her chair. No one spoke much, and yet nothing about the silence seemed strained. It was simply accepted, like the rules of the hotel itself.
The buffet was modest: eggs, bread rolls, slices of cheese, fruit that tasted faintly overripe. The coffee machine hummed in the corner, spitting out the same thin stream no matter how many cups were poured. No one refilled it. No one seemed to think it needed refilling.
On the wall by the entrance hung the duty list. A wide board, divided into hours and tasks, with neat rows of names written in many hands. Empty bins, reception, room service, windows. My name was already there, written neatly next to Room Service, 3 PM. I had no memory of signing it.
Later that day, I emptied a bin in the hallway. The liner was filled with scraps of paper, old receipts, broken pens. Items I didn‚Äôt recognize. Still, I carried it dutifully down the stairs and out to a collection point behind the lobby. There were always more bags there, though I never saw who left them.
That evening, I returned to the duty board. Guests had signed themselves in for their tasks with the calm certainty of routine. No one complained, no one questioned. When I asked a man about it, he gave me a puzzled look, as though I‚Äôd asked why the sun rises.
‚ÄúIt keeps us busy,‚Äù he said simply. Then he signed his name under windows, 5 PM and walked off with a cloth in his hand.
That night, I took my turn at the reception desk from one to two in the morning.
The lobby at night was different. The lamps buzzed louder than they had during the day and the clock above the desk ticked, but not in rhythm‚Äîit hesitated, then jumped forward, as though time itself were reluctant to move.
At first, all was quiet, but just a few minutes before the end of my shift I heard something.
Three raps on the glass door‚Äîtoo soft to be urgent, too deliberate to be casual.
I swallowed hard, trying to steady my voice. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I called, without looking at the door. ‚ÄúNo check-ins after midnight. We‚Äôre closed.‚Äù
I looked up. The frosted glass pane revealed a tall, wavering figure outside, for a moment, it looked like a stranger in a coat. Then the light flickered, and the silhouette became thinner, angular. I blinked, and in the next instant, I swore it had my shoulders, my stance‚Äîmyself, reflected back at me in a grotesque, elongated form.
The knock came again, but this time it didn‚Äôt match the figure‚Äôs movement. The shadow stood perfectly still, hands by its sides, while the sound of knuckles rapping echoed through the lobby.
The dog from earlier padded into view, nails clicking against the tile. Its ears pricked forward, but instead of barking it only gave a low, keening whine. Then it sat, tail thumping once, and stared at the door as if waiting.
The figure leaned closer to the glass. I couldn‚Äôt see its face, but I felt eyes on me‚Äîdeep, searching, patient. My breath caught in my throat. I had the dreadful certainty that if I so much as twitched, it would mirror me exactly.
The glass fogged faintly, though there was no breath on my side of it. Letters began to appear in the condensation, as though traced by an invisible fingertip. ‚ÄúLEAVE‚Äù
I wanted to move, to call for the manager, to look anywhere but at that shifting form. But I was pinned in place, the silence of the hotel pressing in like a weight. The only sound was the dog‚Äôs soft whimper and the irregular tick of the clock above me.
And then‚Äînothing.
The marks on the glass lingered a moment longer, then smudged away as though erased from the inside. The figure straightened, turned slowly, and walked down the street. I  listened until the footsteps faded, though I never saw where the road led.
The dog sighed and lay down at my feet.
I sat frozen behind the desk, every muscle stiff, until the clock above me lurched toward the hour of two. My shift was finished. I rose, and as I placed the logbook back on the counter, a thought came to my mind.
Why reception duty at all, if no one was ever meant to be checked in?
The question sat heavy in my chest as I walked back to my room.
I lay awake the rest that night, listening.
Somewhere down the hall, a door opened and closed. Footsteps shuffled to a bin, a bag was tied, and the sound of it being carried away echoed faintly before silence fell again. I heard voices drifting up from the lobby‚Äîsomeone taking the reception shift, murmuring polite greetings to no one.
I turned on my side and stared at the curtains, wondering why it all felt so familiar. Why the duties seemed to matter so much, though they led nowhere. Why everyone accepted it without question.
And then it came to me, slow and cold: the names in the logbook. My name among them. Written over and over.
I remembered the hesitation in the manager‚Äôs voice when he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand soon enough.‚Äù
I was here because I had nowhere else to be. Because whatever I had been before had ended.
The realization slid into me like a stone sinking in water. I did not know how I had died. I did not know when. But I knew, with the certainty of the silence around me, that I was no longer alive.
And yet, I still had duties to perform.
Sometimes, faces disappeared.
I began to notice it after a few days. A man I had seen polishing the corridor windows one morning was gone by the next. The woman in the grey cardigan, never returned to her usual seat. No farewells, no luggage carried through the lobby‚Äîjust empty chairs where they had once sat.
When I asked a guest about it, he only shook his head. ‚ÄúEvening duties,‚Äù he muttered, as though that explained everything. He would not say more.



Days passed, though I could not tell how many. The rhythm of the hotel blurred into a cycle of duties and silences.
Then, one evening, I saw my name again.
Written neatly into the list: Reception, 4‚Äì5 a.m.
I had not signed it. But there it was, as if the hotel itself had chosen for me.

At four, I sat behind the reception desk, the logbook open before me. The lamps buzzed faintly overhead. My eyelids were heavy, but something kept me from dozing.
The sound of footsteps pulled me from my thoughts. The manager emerged from the hallway, his suit immaculate but his face ashen, pale in the yellow light. He said nothing as he opened the logbook and carefully drew a line through one of the names.
Then once more, a knocking appeared.
The first rap on the glass made him flinch so hard the pen clattered to the floor. His eyes snapped toward the door, wide with terror. He gripped the counter with both hands, knuckles white, as if bracing himself against a storm.
 ‚ÄúNot again‚Ä¶ not tonight‚Ä¶‚Äù he wispered, his whole body shook. I had never seen such fear in a man.
I stood. The guests upstairs had gathered at the railing, whispering, clutching their pets. Their eyes followed me as I walked past the trembling manager to the door.
The figure outside was taller than I remembered. Its shadow shifted, its form never holding steady. For a heartbeat, I thought it wore my outline again, but stretched, distorted. The air grew colder the nearer I came, as though it carried winter with it.
‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt.‚Äù The manager‚Äôs voice cracked. His fear was raw, desperate. ‚ÄúIf you open it, he will take you.‚Äù
I opened the door.
The Entity waited‚Äîstill, silent. Then it extended a hand, not clawed or monstrous, but pale, steady, as if inviting me on a walk. I stepped outside. The door closed behind us without a sound.
The street was empty. On the horizon, the first glow of dawn bled into the sky. Pale gold spread over the rooftops, soft at first, then brighter, sharper, filling every crack of shadow. We walked side by side, toward the sunrise.
With each step, the world grew fainter. The cobblestones beneath my feet blurred. The facades of houses dissolved into brightness. The air itself thickened, glowing, until I could no longer tell sky from ground.
I turned my head, but there was nothing‚Äîno hotel, no street, no city. Only white radiance stretching in every direction, as if the sun had spilled over and consumed the world. I felt no fear. I felt the urge to break the silence‚Ä¶
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it?‚Äù I asked.
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Death said, a small smile in the voice.
‚ÄúPretty dramatic acting of yours, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù
Death chuckled. ‚ÄúWhat did you expect dying to be like?‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶True.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou left early, compared to the others,‚Äù it said.
‚ÄúDid I?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes. When did you realize?‚Äù
‚ÄúI had my doubts when I read the hotel‚Äôs name. I mean‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòThe Limbo‚Äô? For real?‚Äù
Death laughed softly.
‚ÄúRoutine sucks‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt live with it, nor die with it,‚Äù I said.
A quiet hum of agreement from its side.
‚ÄúThought it would be funny whooping a demon‚Äôs ass.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôd stand a chance?‚Äù Death laughed again, softer.
‚ÄúWhat would you do? Kill me?‚Äù
We both stopped and laughed for a moment, the sound swallowed by the light...

‚ÄúI miss her‚Ä¶ I miss them‚Ä¶‚Äù I said.
‚ÄúI know‚Ä¶ She misses you too.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow could you know?‚Äù
‚ÄúMe? I don‚Äôt.‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶Will she be there?‚Äù
‚ÄúShe was never apart.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even talking to you, am I?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, This path is yours. Yours alone.‚Äù
I thought of her. I thought of them. And as I step into the endless brightness, I carry them with me.

 My partner texted me saying she no longer wants to be in partnership/ relationship with me 2.5 weeks after her labor/ C-section. I am incredibly hurt and at a loss.

Hey all. After a long and arduous labor my partner opted for a C-section in order to keep her body and the newborn safe. I spent the next few days in the hospital as well as the past 2 weeks caring for her and our baby day in and day out (not in a self glorifying sense). I cooked, cleaned, and took care of everything happily. I offered as much mental and physical support for my partner as I possibly could. 

After the first 2 weeks she asked me for space as she needed a reset (we each have our own living spaces, though we always spend extended time at each other's places) after begging her and asking her if it's a good idea, she said it's nothing serious and simply needs space.

So, she had her parents helping her this past week, and she's been texting/ calling me and things have seemed positive. Each day I'd ask if I could come over to help her and our child and continue to have our family bond. She would simply just ask me to wait longer, yet she'd say how grateful she was for me and all of these loving adorations towards me. 

Yesterday (Friday) I texted her saying I understand the pain and post partum sensations she must be going, but it was/ is incredibly hurtful the way she went about things. I told her the disconnect I felt from her and our child and I simply just wanted to see them. I got nothing in response, and, while out for coffee with an old friend, up on heading home, I saw a text from her.

She simply said she no longer wants to continue our relationship/ partnership and has no need to explain further to me. I texted her mom to no response. I ordered her favorite things from one of her favorite restaurants for delivery to her as some sort of message that I want to work on things. 

I am at a loss and I am absolutely gutted. ",2,1756581248.0,beyondthebump,6,0.75,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Barcelona vs. Rayo Vallecano: A La Liga Clash of Titans (and Injuries)**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

The 2025-26 La Liga season kicks off with a classic underdog vs. giant showdown: Rayo Vallecano, the pesky ‚ÄúVolcanoes of Vallecas,‚Äù hosting Barcelona, the defending champions with the swagger of a cat that‚Äôs just realized it‚Äôs out of milk. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a Barcelona tiki-taka pass and the humor of a Rayo defender trying to explain a red card.

---

### Parse the Odds: Barcelona‚Äôs Implied Invincibility

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind Barcelona, with odds hovering around **1.4** (implying a **71% chance of victory**). Rayo? They‚Äôre priced at **6.5-7.0** (a **15-16% chance**), which is about the same odds as betting your Uncle Javier will finally learn to juggle‚Äî*in this lifetime*. The draw sits at **5.2-5.4** (**19-20%**), which feels generous given Barcelona‚Äôs recent 2-1 win over Rayo last season and their historical dominance (28 wins in 45 meetings).

But here‚Äôs the twist: Barcelona‚Äôs defense? A sieve. They leaked two goals in the first half to Levante and nearly blew a 3-0 lead against Mallorca. Meanwhile, Rayo‚Äôs Europa Conference League romp (4-0 over Neman Grodno) proves they can score, but their league form against Barca? A three-game losing streak. Still, with Barcelona missing **Ter Stegen** (back surgery) and **Lewandowski** (muscle injury), the underdogs have a flicker of hope.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, History, and a Side of Drama

Barcelona‚Äôs starting XI will feature Garcia in goal‚Äîa name so generic it could belong to any Spanish goalkeeper who‚Äôs ever spilled coffee. Their attack, though, is still a star-studded gala: Pedri, Gavi, Olmo, and a forward line of Rafinha and young Torres. But without Lewandowski, their finishing could be as inconsistent as a toddler‚Äôs nap schedule.

Rayo, meanwhile, is missing key defenders Momin and Mendi, which is like asking a vegan to host a steakhouse‚Äî\*possible, but not id

I've been involved in local Democratic politics (though, I admit, I have some dramatically different ideas than the FoCo Dems) and have always felt a calling towards managing or orchestrating a local political campaign. I figure there might be folks here who've thought about running for office but don't know where to start.  Whether it's city council, school board, or other local positions, I think there's plenty of room for new voices.  


What I bring to the table:

- Professional fundraising experience (currently a Major Gifts Officer at a nonprofit with ~$12 million in operating budget; formerly in positions at both smaller nonprofits and in higher ed)
- Media and public relations coaching experience
- Marketing & communications background in both nonprofit and corporate sectors
- Experience (and great love for) managing teams and organizing volunteers.  The death of civic virtue and volunteerism is one of those things I'd love to use our platform to re-prioritize
- Formerly active with Forsyth County DNC (Marketing & Communications)
- Environmental Science degree with focus on Sustainable Planning & Leadership

What I'm looking for:

- Someone who wants to bring real progressive change to Winston-Salem. I'm especially interested in candidates who want to tackle issues like affordable housing, sustainability, transit, economic equity, and making our city work better for everyone...not just the developers who know the mayor and the wealthy who think we need a cigar bar downtown but not a grocery store. In short:  someone else who is sick of Simon Burgess opening rundown businesses in historical spaces.

I'm open to working with first-time candidates and smaller races. You don't need to have all the answers.  I'm just looking for just the drive to make our community better and a willingness to put in the work.

If you've been thinking ""someone should do something about [insert local issue here]""...then maybe that someone is you.

But you might be saying to yourself:  ""Me?  I'm just a regular person.""

And that's exactly why you should represent regular people like you.  

Let's grab coffee/tea/beer/whisk(e)y (my treat) and talk about how to turn ideas into action.

Arrival
- We used USATransers (highly recommend: they were easy to find at airport and wait time for shuttle to resort was <10min).
- Once we arrived to the resort after a ~40min drive our bags were tagged and taken, we were offered a cold towel and a welcome drink. 
- We opted to pay for the club so check in was in a separate area. While waiting to be called we enjoyed the finger foods and drinks (including coffees, fresh juices, and liquors (self pour)). 
- After 15min we were introduced to our butler who then showed us around the property and our rooms. 

Room
- Wristband opens the room
- we had plunge pool, highly recommend it. After a day of beach, eating and drinking, nothing more relaxing than to sit in your own private pool. We were in building 1. 
- Clean
- Mini fridge restocked daily (can request specifics, for example only Mexican coke, or only tecate beer, etc.)
- Maid service came twice a day (AM and turning down the room in the PM)
- Room service is free for club members - a closet like door is in the entrance that staff can drop off room service without entering the room. 

Beach
- easy to reserve chairs 
- water was beautifully warm however had much sargassum

Environment 
- clean and friendly 
- Designated smoking areas (seemed a little loose)

Staff 
- ‚ÄúMy pleasure‚Äù was a constant.
- Very friendly

Drinks 
- B+ (variety, strength, bars available)
- Ice was filtered 

Food
- many options 
- Italian, French, Japanese, buffet, ‚Äúfast food‚Äù, steak house

Entertainment
- at the pools many activities that staff try to hype up
- every night 2/3 shows (duet, queen, mj, Caribbean, band, etc.)

Departure 
- Made our way over to the main lobby with our bags, got our wristbands cut off and were free to go. 
- Again, USATransfers was excellent. They were on time and dropped us off at the airport. 


Cons
- Hallway noise seemed to echo and could be heard in room (RIP early sleepers). 
- Butler had days off and it didn‚Äôt seem like we had a butler to assist for at least 2 days. 

Pros
- Butler added us to WhatsApp chat so it was easy to communicate (when he was there). 
- Had a situation arise where we were woken up by staff very early in the morning mistakenly - they gave us an extra bottle of premium liquor (if I had thought about it more I probrably could‚Äôve requested a massage)

Tips
- request aromatherapy every day, it was a game changer! (orange, white tea, lavender and apple.) 
- Learn a little Spanish, staff will always start conversations in Spanish but will easily switch off to English if needed. 
- Carrey small bills for tipping (usd) - unless you have time to convert to peso. 
- Book kabuki (Japanese hibachi) and bistro (French restaurant) right away (only restaurants that require reservations) - must bring long pants and closed shoes. 
- If you  want to try all the restaurants make sure to see when they are open, some are only open for dinner on certain days

French Avenue Vulcan is controversial. At first, I didn‚Äôt like it much because it smelled very feminine, but once it dries down, the scent is very pleasant‚Äîone of my favorites, but only recommended if you like mango and sweet perfumes.
9PM never fails; it‚Äôs just as they say. It smells the same or even better than the original JPG Ultra Male. The only thing is that I feel the longevity could be better. I need to test it more to give better feedback. Highly recommended!
Amber Oud Gold Edition Extrait is also a bit strange. I like it, but there‚Äôs a note at the end that I still don‚Äôt fully enjoy. A lot of people rave about this perfume, but I‚Äôm not sure if I got the wrong version because there‚Äôs something that doesn‚Äôt quite win me over yet. That said, I need to test it more‚Äîthese are just first impressions after trying it for 1‚Äì2 days

Compared to a cowardly death by torture, she'd choose a blaze of glory.



Chapter 1

Eight years into their marriage, the High Society Circle's prodigal heir publicly declared he'd give half his shares to his virtuous wife Rebecca.

This so enraged his most cherished woman that she dashed into the road and was struck dead.

After her death, the heir descended into madness.

He unleashed his fury on Rebecca, personally delivering her to prison where she was tortured to death.

Reborn, Rebecca resolved to choose Charles‚Äîthe tech prodigy who'd loved her hopelessly in her past life, future richest man.

Yet she'd awakened precisely when she'd just rejected Charles' proposal.

Worse still, she wasn't the only one reborn...

‚Äî‚Äî

""Rebecca, since you've chosen Dennis, I'll let go. I won't bother you again.

May you and Dennis... have eternal happiness.""

The achingly familiar voice, thick with restrained sorrow, pierced Rebecca's ears. Her heart clenched as bitterness flooded her.

She blinked hard, her blurred vision gradually sharpening.

Crimson roses carpeted the floor.

Before her stood a man holding a diamond ring‚Äîtall and straight-shouldered, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders and lean waist, his presence cool as winter pine.

His deep almond eyes clearly reflected her own twenty-three-year-old self.

Rebecca's heart contracted violently.

She truly had been reborn!

And awakened on the very day she'd pushed Charles away!

""Goodbye, Miss Scott.""

Charles snapped the ring box shut, swallowing the lump in his throat as he turned to leave.

""Charles!

Don't go!""

Rebecca desperately wrapped her arms around the man's lean waist from behind.

Charles' spine stiffened, his ears flushing crimson.

His hands moved to pry hers away: ""Miss Scott, having chosen Dennis, you should stay faithful.

What's the meaning of clinging to me now?""

Hearing ""Dennis,"" memories of her past life's agony stabbed Rebecca's heart.

The pain stole her breath.

In that life, her mother had just passed when Gerald brought his mistress and illegitimate daughter‚Äîbarely six months Rebecca's junior‚Äîinto their home.

Gerald adored only those two. Rebecca lived suffocated and humiliated within the Scott household.

To escape that prison, she'd played Charles and Dennis against each other.

Charles was the gifted tech prodigy from humble roots; Dennis, the silver-spooned wastrel prince of the High Society Circle.

Ultimately, she chose Dennis with his grander lineage.

Though a playboy, Dennis had‚Äîunder Rebecca's relentless pushing and guidance‚Äîdoubled the corporation's profits.

At Group's anniversary gala, Dennis publicly vowed to gift her half his shares.

Yet on the share transfer day, Dennis' favorite mistress had stormed into traffic and died instantly.

After her death, Dennis went mad, blaming Rebecca entirely. He framed her for murder and threw her behind bars.

Only on her deathbed did Dennis reveal Charles had offered his entire hard-earned fortune to buy her freedom.

Then she finally grasped the depth of Charles' love.

In that past life, unloved by her father, crushed by stepmother and stepsister, used as a pawn by Dennis while battling his mistresses‚Äîshe'd never shed a tear.

Yet seeing Charles' note‚Äî""Eternal regret for failing to shield the bright moon""‚Äîshe'd wept uncontrollably.

But Dennis had no intention of letting her go.

In the end, she met a tragic death in prison during an ""accident,"" dying with eyes wide open.

Her only thought before dying was: if there were a next life, she would never miss Charles again.

Returning to the present, Rebecca suppressed the sorrow in her eyes and blurted out: ""No! I was blind before, mistaking fish eyes for pearls! I won't choose him now. Charles, I choose you!""

Hearing this, the last glimmer in Charles's eyes extinguished. He pried her hand away coldly. ""Miss Scott, stop playing games with me.""

Panic surged through Rebecca as she tried to explain, but an enraged shout cut through:

""Rebecca!

What the fuck are you doing?!""

Rebecca whirled around.

Dennis.

The spoiled heir she'd devoted her past life to supporting. The man who'd gifted her company shares before becoming her murderer.

""Rebecca! Yesterday you fucking swore you'd marry no one but me! Today you're clinging to another man?"" Dennis hurled insults like knives. ""So I'm just another fish in your pond? When did you become such a promiscuous bitch?""

Rebecca stared impassively at his twisted, handsome face.

Then stepped forward and slapped him hard across the cheek.

Silence swallowed the air.

While Dennis raged, Rebecca glanced at her stinging palm and suddenly laughed.

The sharp pain confirmed it‚Äîshe had truly been reborn.

Ignoring Dennis, she took the diamond ring from Charles and slid it onto her ring finger.

Meeting Charles's stunned gaze, she declared with burning intensity, each word crystal clear:

""Charles Gonzalez, I will marry you.

I only ask: will you marry me?

If yes, come propose at the Scott estate tomorrow.""

Chapter 2

Charles froze.

After a long pause, his Adam's apple bobbed as he started to answer, ""Of course I‚Äî""

""Like hell you do!""

Dennis's mocking laugh cut him off.

Dennis pulled out his phone and played a video. Suddenly, explicit moans filled the air.

""Let me enlighten you, Charles. Last night this woman was in my bed. Nearly shook the bed apart.""

""She's just secondhand goods I've used. You, the tech mogul, really wanna be the sucker who picks up someone's sloppy seconds?""

Rebecca's blood ran cold.

The video showed her and Dennis locked in passionate embrace!

But she knew‚Äîthey'd never done such things.

This version of Dennis had no reason to ruin her reputation.

Unless... like her, he'd also been reborn.

No time to dwell. She had to clear this up now.

Charles was fiercely jealous and a clean freak. If he believed Dennis...

""Dennis, you think some deepfake video proves anything?""

""We weren't together last night! Where's your proof I was at that hotel?""

""Proof?"" Dennis sneered venomously. ""Miss Scott, that plum blossom birthmark on your left breast? I remember its color vividly‚Äî""

""Enough!"" Rebecca trembled with rage.

Dennis had truly reborn.

Only that could explain his knowing such intimate details.

Yet in this life, she remained the untouched Scott heiress. Reputation meant everything in high society. If this spread...

Dennis smirked, icy gaze shifting to Charles. ""See now, Charles? You'll attend our wedding, won't you?""

Rebecca felt certain Charles wouldn't believe it‚Äîuntil she saw his face.

Charles stood deathly pale, eyes bloodshot as he stared at the screen. His jaw clenched, fighting back agony.

Finally, lips quivering, he rasped, ""Understood. I wish you both... a long and happy life together.""

""My apologies. Business calls.""

He wrenched the diamond ring off Rebecca's finger and walked away, silhouette utterly defeated.

""Charles!""

Rebecca tried to chase him, but Dennis dragged her into the Maybach, pinning her in the backseat.

""Give it up, Rebecca. This life, you'll marry me.""

She struggled wildly. ""Marry me? What about your precious mistress?""

""Relax. After my 'dearly departed' wife dies young, I'll marry her properly. She'll inherit everything.""

Dennis leaned close, breath like demon's whisper against her ear.

""You're mine in life, Rebecca. Mine in death. Don't think clinging to Charles will save you. I won't allow it. Ever.""

He shoved her out onto the street.

The Maybach's engine roared, shattering the evening's peace as it vanished.

Rebecca collapsed on the pavement, gasping for air. Forced herself to calm down.

It's fine.

She'd already died once. What was there left to fear?

She would rather die than marry, what could Dennis do?

Yet that very night, Rebecca was summoned to the study by her father, Jonathan.

Her stepmother Debra and half-sister Lisa were also present.

Debra maintained her gentle facade, speaking softly: ""Rebecca dear, you're at the age to marry.

Dennis seems truly devoted to you, and his family background is excellent. Why not accept?

What do you think?""

Hearing this, Rebecca sneered inwardly.

Dennis did come from a prominent family, but in her past life when she wanted to marry him, this mother-daughter pair had obstructed her at every turn, terrified she'd climb the social ladder.

Now they were encouraging it?

Undoubtedly, Dennis had manipulated the situation.

Lifting her gaze, she caught the envy flashing in Debra's eyes and the venomous glare from Lisa beside her.

An idea sparked in her mind.

She lowered her lashes, feigning her usual docility: ""I'll follow Father and Aunt Debra's arrangements.""

Jonathan nodded, pleased by her compliance, and dismissed her.

Sure enough, while passing Debra's room that night, Rebecca heard Lisa's shrill, hysterical shriek:

""That motherless jinx Rebecca isn't worthy of Dennis!

I should be the one marrying him!

I'm Father's favorite Scott heiress!""

Outside the door, Rebecca dug her nails into her palms: Don't worry, dear sister. I'll gladly let you have him.

Back in her room, she received the surveillance footage from last night's Werewolf game with friends.

Relieved, she could now prove her innocence to Charles.

But when she opened Charles' chat window and sent the video, a red exclamation mark appeared.

Staring at that glaring symbol, Rebecca's hands trembled slightly.

Charles had blocked her?

!

Without hesitation, she threw on a coat and rushed to Charles' downtown penthouse.

At the entrance, the butler politely barred her way.

""Miss Scott, apologies. Mr. Gonzalez has instructed he'll see no visitors.""

Her heart sank, voice trembling with tears: ""Why won't he see me? Did Dennis threaten him?

Is it...""

The butler interrupted: ""Mr. Gonzalez also said from now on, you two shall go your separate ways. All ties are severed!""

Rebecca's vision darkened, ears ringing.

But she quickly wiped her tears.

It didn't matter. Charles would attend their mutual friend's birthday party next week.

Chapter 3

She still had a chance to see him.

A week later at the exclusive club.

Rebecca took a deep breath and pushed open the VIP lounge door.

She immediately spotted Charles surrounded by a crowd on the sofa.

He held a wine glass between his fingers, his sharp profile exuding icy detachment.

After sitting, Rebecca smiled at nearby friends while stealing glances at him.

But he never looked her way.

After several drinks, someone suggested Truth or Dare, heating up the mood.

When Charles's turn came, he chose Truth.

The questioner grinned mischievously: ""Charles, what kind of person do you hate most?""

The room hushed slightly.

Charles tapped his glass with slender fingers, answering deliberately.

""I despise greedy people‚Äîtaking year-end bonuses here while eyeing benefits elsewhere.""

""There's a perfect word for them,"" he suddenly locked eyes with Rebecca, ""Rebecca, care to guess?""

Rebecca turned ghostly pale, palms turning clammy.

The answer hung in the air‚Äîwanting both worlds.

Tension froze the room briefly.

Someone quickly defused it, resuming the game.

Charles excused himself coldly and walked out.

Rebecca swallowed her pain and chased after him.

""Charles! Charles...""

His tall figure marched down the endless corridor.

Eyes reddening, Rebecca sprinted in heels to explain herself.

Just as she rounded a corner, a hand clamped her wrist.

""Charles won't acknowledge you. Why chase him?""

""Playing desperate?""

Dennis again‚Äîalways lurking nearby.

His iron grip trapped her as she snapped, ""None of your business!""

A sly glint flashed in Dennis's eyes.

Rebecca's heart lurched.

He snapped his fingers‚Äîtwo burly guards pinned her arms.

""Let go!""

""Dennis, what are you doing?!""

She fought wildly but got her jaw forced open.

""Be good. Don't waste my special treat.""

Dennis crooned softly while shoving a red pill down her throat.

""Mmph‚Äî!""

Rebecca gagged reflexively.

Dennis gripped her neck, pouring hard liquor down.

""Cough..."" The burn brought tears as liquor seared her throat.

He watched approvingly‚Äîher eyes glazing, cheeks flushing, breath scorching.

Waving guards away, he manacled her slender waist.

""Come. Let's sober you up.""

Dennis sneered, half-dragging her toward the lounge.

The drug's surge turned her weak struggles into coy resistance.

Through her haze, a tall figure materialized down the hall.

Charles.

Frost etched his face, gaze riveted on Dennis's grip around Rebecca's waist.

""Rebecca!""

His voice strained as he strode forward.

Rebecca struggled to whimper, ""Charles, help‚Äî""

""Apologies for the scene, Mr. Gonzalez.""

Her plea was cut short. Charles's arm tightened around her waist as his mocking voice drifted above her head. ""This girl can't hold her liquor but keeps drinking. Drunk out of her mind, she clung to me saying she missed our time in the presidential suite, begging to relive it."" Dennis deliberately emphasized ""presidential suite.""

""No... not..."" Rebecca attempted to deny, only managing choked gasps.

""Hush now, baby. Mr. Gonzalez is watching."" Dennis tenderly wiped her tears before meeting Charles's fiery eyes, his smile freezing. ""Mr. Gonzalez, are you really interfering in lovers' games? Quite presumptuous."" He enunciated every syllable, ""Rebecca will be my wife. Would I harm her? Know your place.""

Charles's outstretched hand froze mid-air. Time seemed suspended. Finally, his clenched fingers slowly curled inward, dropping limply to his side. The last flicker of hope in Rebecca's eyes extinguished. She ceased struggling, letting Dennis drag her into the private lounge like a rag doll.

As soon as the door closed, Dennis slammed her onto the leather sofa. Drug-induced weakness left her powerless. He loomed over her with darkened eyes, undoing his buttons. One by one.

Chapter 4

Before consciousness completely faded, Rebecca saw Dennis leering down at her.

How much time had passed?

Rebecca struggled to open her eyes. The crystal chandelier on the private room ceiling swam into view.

Awareness trickled back.

Excruciating pain tore through her body, exposed skin mottled with bruises.

The air reeked of stale decay.

""Ugh...""

Rebecca retched violently, only spitting up bile.

Trembling, she straightened her torn dress, staggered upright, and stumbled from the exclusive club.

Dim parking lot lights glowed in the dead of night.

As her knees buckled, she spotted a familiar silhouette.

Charles.

He hadn't left.

Leaning against his black Bentley, cigarette ash dangling from his fingers‚Äîhe'd waited ages.

Seeing her sway, Charles rushed forward.

""Rebecca...""

That same hand reached toward her.

Instantly, she remembered those fingers abandoning her, shoving her toward Dennis.

She recoiled like from scalding iron.

Spine rigid with effort, she turned away.

Leaving him frozen in the night wind.

Finally, she found her car.

""Thud!""

The door slammed shut. Rebecca collapsed over the steering wheel.

""Woo..."" Shoulders shaking, she muffled sobs into the leather.

Four AM. Rebecca returned home with swollen eyes.

She scrubbed herself raw in the shower.

The Dennis family held power. Gerald had always wanted this marriage alliance.

Rebecca knew reporting it would make her father bury the case and deliver her faster.

She gnawed her lip bloody, swallowing cries.

Fine. Like a dog bite.

After washing off the stench, she curled up in bed.

Fingertips traced her mother's photo on the nightstand.

At ten, she'd watched that homewrecker provoke Mom into fatal labor.

Hatred took root. But powerless, she'd had to call the thief ""Mother.""

Enduring humiliation, begging permission yearly to visit Mom's grave.

That day taught her:

Without power or allies, you're trampled dust. Not even life's guaranteed.

She brushed the photo's gentle smile. ""Mom, last life I tried pleasing both sides for freedom. Was I wrong?""

Moonlight silvered the room as Rebecca clutched the frame, sinking into sleep.

Mom's dream-voice soothed: ""Sweetheart, you weren't wrong. Those who love you understand.""

The vision shattered‚Äîback on that private room sofa, memories flaying her alive...

Morning came with tear-soaked sheets.

Freshly washed, a knock came. ""Miss Rebecca, Dennis is here proposing. Hurry to the front hall.""

Her heart sank‚ÄîDennis had moved so quickly.

Rebecca forced herself through the lingering pain and hurried to the front hall, where Dennis was chatting warmly with her father.

""I fell for Rebecca at first sight, Mr. Scott,"" Dennis said, uncharacteristically humble. ""I sincerely wish to marry her.""

Gerald smiled approvingly. ""Since you‚Äôre so earnest, we‚Äôll consult a horoscope specialist tomorrow about your Birth Horoscopes‚Ä¶""

The memory of last night‚Äôs debauchery flooded back, bile rising in Rebecca‚Äôs throat.

Marry him?

That meant surrendering herself to that monster again, reliving her brutal past death.

She couldn‚Äôt just wait for doom!

Digging her nails into her palms, she steadied her voice and interrupted.

""Dad, I‚Äôll agree to marry into the Carter family‚Äîbut on one condition.""

Gerald‚Äôs smile vanished. ""Rebecca, mind your manners.""

Dennis‚Äôs grin didn‚Äôt waver. ""Name it. Anything within my power.""

Rebecca drew a sharp breath, gambling everything. ""I demand two billion in Bride Price‚Äîand the prime downtown land the Carter group is developing. It must be transferred to me.""

Gerald gasped audibly. Rebecca straightened her spine, hiding every trace of vulnerability.

Please let this outrageous demand force Dennis to back down, she prayed.

But Dennis only chuckled, amused. ""Done. Only you, Rebecca, could make extortion look so charming.""

Something was wrong.

As Rebecca frowned, Dennis pivoted toward the hall‚Äôs entrance.

""I wonder what Mr. Gonzalez thinks of this?""

Rebecca‚Äôs mind went blank. She turned stiffly.

There, looming in the doorway, stood a tall, impeccably dressed man.

Chapter 5

It was Charles.

Seeing his grim expression, Rebecca froze.

Over there, Gerald had already risen to greet him. ""Mr. Gonzalez, what brings you here today?""

Charles glanced at Rebecca, replying politely, ""Mr. Scott, I've come to propose marriage.""

Rebecca's heart pounded wildly.

The next moment, his calm, unruffled voice cut through the air. ""I wish to marry your second daughter, Lisa.""

Hope shattered completely. Rebecca struggled to breathe.

Her mind reeled.

In her past life, Charles had remained unmarried because of her.

Every time they met, he‚Äôd always find a way to speak to her, his ears flushing crimson.

He‚Äôd even spent a fortune investigating the truth for her, ready to trade his entire fortune for her freedom.

But now, everything had changed.

He said he wanted to marry‚Äîand marry Lisa, that illegitimate half-sister she‚Äôd resented for years!

Rebecca‚Äôs face paled. She opened her mouth to protest, but Lisa suddenly burst forward.

""Dad!

I won‚Äôt marry him!"" Her voice cracked with hysteria. ""Dad!

I love Dennis! I don‚Äôt want to marry anyone else. Rebecca and Charles seem perfect together‚Äîwhy not just swap brides?

Please?""

For the first time, Rebecca felt her foolish sister had done something right.

She looked hopefully at Charles.

But Charles didn‚Äôt even glance her way. ""Mr. Scott, I cannot marry Miss Rebecca. She and Dennis are deeply in love. I won‚Äôt come between them.""

Rebecca‚Äôs chest tightened. ""Dennis and I have nothing to do with each other!"" she protested loudly.

""Nothing?"" Dennis rose, his voice feigning hurt. ""Rebecca, we were so close. How can you deny it now?""

""You‚Äî"" Rebecca choked on her fury.

Dennis turned his back to the others, smirking. ""The paparazzi already caught us, Rebecca. Just admit it openly. No need to be shy.""

At his words, everyone pulled out their phones to check the day‚Äôs trending topic.

.

Rebecca‚Äôs heart plummeted.

Sure enough, Gerald thrust his phone at her, his face livid. ""Rebecca!

Look at this!""

Rebecca‚Äôs mind went blank.

The headline screamed: Scott Heiress and Carter Heir‚Äôs Two-Hour Rendezvous in Exclusive Club Suite

Below it sprawled a nine-photo grid.

They were sneaked shots through the suite door‚Äîboth disheveled, tangled together!

Under the drug‚Äôs influence, her cheeks were flushed, eyes glazed as she yielded to the man, appearing utterly lost in pleasure.

Rebecca‚Äôs face turned deathly white. She whirled to glare at Dennis.

He wore an expression of detached innocence. Instantly, she knew‚Äîthis was all Dennis‚Äôs doing!

""He forced me‚Äî"" The words tumbled out, trembling.

""Enough!"" Gerald roared, cutting her off.

His face darkened like storm clouds. ""The Scott family won‚Äôt tolerate a heartless liar! Rebecca, you will take responsibility for Dennis. Don‚Äôt you dare disgrace him!""

The verdict was final. Despair washed over Rebecca.

With the photos flooding the internet, and Gerald valuing family honor above all, she had no choice but to marry.

Lifting her eyes, she met a pair of icy ones.

Mixed with coldness, disgust, disappointment...

Charles's gaze was like a blunt knife, slowly carving her heart until it was riddled with holes.

Beside them, Lisa's heart sank to the pit of her stomach.

She knew her chance to marry Dennis had vanished.

Lifelessly, she asked Charles, ""Mr. Gonzalez, do you truly wish to marry me?""

Charles stared at Rebecca's face, his thin lips parting as he spoke in a cruel tone.

""Miss Lisa, my devotion to you is absolute. I swear you'll be my only love‚Äîno wandering eyes, ever.""

Rebecca's eyes instantly reddened.

Through her daze, she heard Lisa's shy reply: ""Alright then... I'll marry you.""

Following their parents' arrangement, both Rebecca and Lisa became engaged on the same day.

Their weddings were set for mid-September‚Äîthe fifteenth.

After the guests departed,

Rebecca slipped out the back door, blocking Charles's stretch limo: ""Why did you do this?

Did you deliberately choose to marry my sister?""

The car window slid down, revealing Charles's cold voice: ""Yes. I aimed to destroy any hope you had of marrying me. Consider this your closure.""

The words hung in the air as the car sped away, leaving dust in its wake.

The scorching sun baked Rebecca's heart, suffocating her.

Her legs gave way, collapsing onto the asphalt as tears flooded down.

From that day on, Rebecca remained secluded indoors.

Reborn into this life, she'd changed nothing‚Äîonly watched helplessly as fate slid toward a worse outcome.

Tormented day and night, she wasted away until her clothes hung loose.

Until the day arrived: an invitation to a charity gala.

She attended, if only for distraction.

Upon reaching the hotel hosting the event,

Rebecca realized‚Äîthis was where she and Charles had first met.

Chapter 6

Back then, falsely accused by Lisa, Rebecca fled alone in distress and stumbled into the gala.

A clumsy waiter bumped into her just as she was about to crash into the champagne tower‚Äîuntil an embrace carrying the scent of cedarwood steadied her.

That was how they met.

Her memories shattered when a couple approached arm-in-arm.

The man wore an immaculate suit; the woman‚Äôs silk embroidered dress clung to her delicate curves.

Rebecca froze upon recognizing them.

Charles and Lisa.

Spotting Rebecca, Lisa flashed a triumphant smirk before grabbing Charles‚Äô lapel and kissing him.

Camera flashes erupted, flooding the venue with blinding light.

Rebecca‚Äôs heart clenched painfully.

She watched Charles expressionlessly ease Lisa away.

Yet Rebecca remained rooted, unable to move.

She watched them stroll closer.

Watched Charles unbutton his tailored suit jacket and drape it over Lisa‚Äôs shoulders.

The aloof CEO and the radiant Scott heiress‚Äîa picture-perfect match.

But Charles‚Äô gaze turned icy the moment he noticed Rebecca, offering only a curt nod. ""Miss Rebecca.""

In their past life, he‚Äôd always called her ""Rebecca.""

Now, only this distant ""Miss Rebecca"" remained.

Her face paled, eyes brimming with anguish.

The man who‚Äôd once adored her‚Äîwhy had everything changed?

Lisa glanced at a waiter‚Äôs tray and murmured softly, ""Charles, I feel unwell. Champagne‚Äôs too cold. I‚Äôd like warm ginger tea.""

Charles nodded and left alone.

Two minutes later, he returned with a steaming porcelain cup for Lisa.

His tender gaze as he watched her sip pierced Rebecca‚Äôs heart like needles.

""Drink slowly.""

Hearing his low, affectionate tone, Rebecca‚Äôs eyes burned.

In their past life, ginger tea with brown sugar would always appear when she suffered during her period.

She‚Äôd known it came from Charles.

Now, that exclusive tenderness belonged to another.

Rebecca fled in despair.

...

Back home, Rebecca numbly endured bridal shop attendants fitting her wedding gown.

They lavished praise on her beauty, but she remained silent.

Marrying Dennis meant certain death.

After a sleepless night, she resolved:

Run!

She had to run!

Next morning,

Rebecca took valuable jewelry to pawn for escape money.

""Sorry, Miss Rebecca. We can‚Äôt accept this.""

""Please leave, Miss Rebecca.""

Rejected by every top jewelry buyer,

the last manager finally confessed under pressure: ""Mr. Lee‚Äôs orders. Anyone who takes your items loses their business.""

Of course. Him.

Fury surged through Rebecca.

Her father would freeze all her accounts once she fled.

Dennis knew cash was vital‚Äîhe‚Äôd sealed her escape route.

Just as despair set in,

her phone buzzed with an auction advertisement.

Rebecca perked up immediately.

She could still consign anonymously, bypassing Dennis' ban.

Rebecca contacted the auction house at once, anonymously consigning her most valuable emerald brooch.

The auction venue brimmed with perfumed elegance, gathering socialites.

Rebecca sat low in a shadowed corner, wearing a hat covering half her face.

Nervous yet unable to look away, her gaze fixed on Charles and Lisa seated upfront.

As the auction peaked, a pair of antique couple's watches debuted.

Lisa's eyes sparkled as she nudged Charles' arm, cooing: ""Darling, these watches suit us perfectly!

Let's bid for them as love tokens?

Please?""

Charles scanned the watches and raised his hand: ""Unlimited bidding.""

The room erupted.

In her corner, Rebecca dug her nails into her palm, swallowing bitter anguish.

Ultimately, the antique watches sold for a staggering sum.

Amidst all eyes, Charles removed his Patek Philippe wristwatch, replacing it with the new antique timepiece.

Rebecca clenched her jaw against tears.

That Patek Philippe was her birthday gift to Charles.

He'd once blushed, promising to treasure it forever.

Yet now, he'd discarded it so casually.

Before she regained composure, the couple ahead had already risen arm-in-arm to depart.

Chapter 7

Lisa spotted Rebecca in the corner.

She curved her red lips, ""Charles, that old watch is an eyesore. Just toss it‚Äîdon't need to keep gifts from certain people taking up space.

Right, sister?""

Rebecca bit her lower lip till blood spread in her mouth.

Charles glanced over, locking eyes with her.

Meeting her red-rimmed gaze, he flinched and looked away instantly.

He smiled at Lisa, ""Let's go.""

Lisa shot Rebecca a contemptuous look before leaving arm-in-arm with Charles.

After the auction, Rebecca stumbled backstage to settle payment but was told, ""Sorry, your funds are frozen.""

Her last hope shattered.

As she wandered out dazed, a Maybach glided silently before her.

The window lowered, revealing Dennis's butler's stern face: ""Miss Scott, Mr. Lee reminds you the wedding approaches. Quit these improper notions and await your marriage at home.""

The luxury car sped off, leaving Rebecca pale-faced in the icy wind.

That night, nightmares consumed Rebecca.

One moment she dreamed of Charles clasping a necklace around her neck, calling her ""Rebecca"" tenderly.

The next, she saw Charles carefully supporting pregnant Lisa, who turned to glare with disgust: ""A loose woman like you deserves my attention?""

Gasping for breath, she woke up.

Drenched in sweat, Rebecca stared blankly at the silk canopy overhead, utterly drained.

Perhaps it was time to let go.

Days passed with Rebecca secluded indoors.

A week before the wedding, a friend gifted her motorcycle race tickets.

""Consider it pre-wedding relaxation,"" the friend urged.

Not wishing to refuse, Rebecca attended.

At the venue, she spotted Charles and Lisa.

Both wore riding gear, astride motorcycles‚Äîhandsome man, beautiful woman, perfectly matched.

Rebecca's heart clenched.

Charles detested such sports; his presence meant indulging Lisa's hobby.

Spotting her friend waving from the stands, Rebecca approached.

Near the track, sudden shrieks erupted:

""Oh god! Lisa's bike is out of control!""

Rebecca whirled around.

A motorcycle careened wildly, Lisa gripping the handlebars in panic.

Their eyes met.

Lisa abruptly twisted the handlebars.

The machine lunged like a crazed stallion, roaring toward Rebecca.

Too fast to dodge.

In a split second, Charles charged sideways.

Two choices: save Rebecca or save Lisa.

Time seemed to slow.

Breath trapped, Rebecca watched Charles leap through the air‚Äî

‚Äîcradling Lisa as they tumbled clear, abandoning her to the crushing wheels.

The heavy bike slammed Rebecca down, pinning her leg beneath it.

Crack! The bone-snapping sound echoed, horrifying.

Excruciating pain surged. A guttural moan escaped her throat.

Before blacking out, she saw Charles holding Lisa securely in his arms,

his gaze never touching her.

When Rebecca opened her eyes again, the first faces she saw were her stepmother's and Lisa's hypocritical expressions.

""You're finally awake. You were unconscious for two days straight‚Äîwe were so worried.""

Rebecca realized both her legs were encased in plaster casts, suspended high above the bed.

She tried to move them but felt nothing.

Panic seized her. She grabbed Lisa's wrist, her throat tight. ""What happened to my legs?""

Lisa stammered, unable to answer, tears streaming down her face.

Dread coiled tighter in Rebecca's chest. She screamed, ""Tell me! What's wrong with my legs?""

Only muffled sobs filled the hospital room.

After a moment, her stepmother spoke with feigned sorrow‚Äî

""Severe comminuted fractures, nerve damage too. The doctors say... you might never walk again.""

Her mind exploded.

Rebecca froze, all sound vanishing.

Tremors wracked her body. Her vision blurred as she whispered, ""No... this can't be real...""

Suddenly, the memory crashed over her.

Her eyes blazed crimson. She dug her nails into Lisa's wrist, voice raw. ""Did you do this on purpose?""

A flicker of guilt crossed Lisa's eyes before she fell silent.

Rage erupted. Rebecca shattered. ""I saw it! You twisted the handlebar‚Äîthat motorcycle came straight at me! You meant to do it!""

Lisa avoided her gaze, voice sickeningly sweet. ""I'm sorry, sis. I know you're upset about your legs, but how can you accuse me without proof?""

Watching Lisa's stone-faced denial, Rebecca choked on her fury.

Past and present collided. This woman never changed‚Äîalways playing the victim after causing harm.

Fresh hatred merged with old wounds. Rebecca detonated. ""You did this! You're still pretending‚Äî""

A cool, detached voice cut through.

""Miss Scott, it was an accident. No one wanted this.""

Rebecca froze.

She turned toward the door. Charles stood there, flowers in hand, expression unreadable.

Abruptly, her fury drained, leaving numbness.

""Get out. All of you.""

Silence hung thick. After exchanged glances, they filed out quietly.

Before leaving, Charles placed the bouquet gently on the nightstand.

His throat worked, but no words came. He shut the door behind him.

Alone, Rebecca snatched the flowers and hurled them against the wall.

Petals scattered like broken promises.

Rebecca's injury delayed her wedding to Dennis.

The Scotts offered to cancel the engagement, but Dennis declared publicly: ""Even if Rebecca never walks again, I'll marry her.""

Overnight, the entire High Society Circle envied Rebecca's ""fortunate destiny""‚Äî

A cripple still winning the Carter heir's true love.

But no one saw Dennis's dual faces. Alone with Rebecca, arrogance dripped from his every word.

""Since you're a cripple now, behave. Once you enter the Lee family, be a quiet ornament. Don't step outside without my permission.""

Rebecca met his gaze with icy silence.

Her lifeless demeanor bored him. ""Pathetic,"" Dennis scoffed before turning on his heel.

During this time, Charles Gonzalez came to visit once, only to be turned away at the hospital room door.

The man lingered outside for a long while before finally leaving.

As for the apology note and check he had someone deliver, Rebecca Scott tore them to shreds and threw them in the trash.

She wanted nothing more to do with Charles Gonzalez.

Yet news of him still reached her ears on the wind.

She heard his tech company had gone public on the Hong Kong stock exchange, and Gerald Scott was so thrilled he moved up Charles and Lisa Scott's wedding to this month.

She also heard Charles frequently visited Lisa at the Scott estate‚Äîhe cooked while she mixed drinks, their sweet affection obvious.

Today, Charles came to the Scott villa again.

Murmured conversation drifted from the study.

""Lisa, that motorcycle served you well for three years. How could its brakes suddenly fail?""

""You suspect me?""

""I just want a reasonable explanation.""

Silence hung thick in the air.

Suddenly, Lisa snorted. ""Fine. I tampered with it.

I couldn't stand how she gazed at you like some lovesick fool!

She's engaged to Dennis Lee‚Äîwhy pretend to be so devoted?

She deserved it!""

On the nearby terrace, Rebecca's fingers clenched abruptly on her wheelchair.

The late autumn wind carried a chill that seeped into her bones.

Charles had always been principled, with zero tolerance for flaws. He'd abandoned her the moment she showed any imperfection.

He should treat Lisa the same way. At the very least, he should reprimand her.

But his response was only dead silence.

Inside the study, the atmosphere froze.

Lisa, realizing her mistake, softened her voice instantly. ""Charles, I was just jealous and foolish. It clouded my judgment.""

""I know I was wrong. I'll find the best medical team for Rebecca's leg.""

Charles was silent for several seconds before replying flatly, ""Just this once.""

Those four light words slammed into Rebecca's heart like a sledgehammer.

Tearing it to shreds.

Seizing the offered escape, Lisa hurriedly excused herself to fetch newly arrived coffee beans.

Charles sighed softly and turned to leave the study, only to meet a pair of icy eyes.

He paused mid-step, discomfort flickering across his face. ""You... heard everything?""

Rebecca said nothing, just watched him quietly, as if observing a stranger.

That gaze stung Charles.

A flash of guilt crossed his eyes before he pulled a Patek Philippe watch from his inner suit pocket and held it out.

""My wedding is soon. This should be returned to its rightful owner.""

Rebecca stared at the watch, unmoving.

She waited so long Charles's outstretched arm began to stiffen before she slowly raised her own.

""From this moment on,"" her voice rasped, eyes locked on his, ""Rebecca Scott and Charles Gonzalez are finished.""

Her arm snapped forward, slamming the watch onto the ground.

Chapter 1

At the senior management meeting, Matteo Karridge's new female assistant threw an entire cup of latte in my face, right in front of everyone.

""Who do you think you are, doubting my proposal like that?

""You're fired. Now scram!""

I stood up calmly, wiped the coffee off my face, and looked straight at Matteo.

Frowning, he avoided my gaze and stayed quiet.

I smiled and pulled out my phone.

""Dad, did you catch that?

""Someone just told me to scram.""

\*\*\*

On Monday, I was completely absorbed in a game when there was a sudden knock on my office door.

""Ms. Akre, Ms. Norman said all managers need to be in the main conference room for a meeting in ten minutes.""

I kept my eyes on the screen, my fingers flying over the keyboard.

""I'm not going. I'm swamped.""

In the six months since I joined the company, I hadn't attended a single meeting.

That wasn't because I didn't have to, but because I didn't feel like it.

""But..."" Thomas hesitated, ""Ms. Norman made it clear that everyone has to be there today. She said it's straight from Mr. Karridge.""

My fingers paused mid-tap, and just like that, my game character got wiped out by the boss.

As the screen went gray, I cursed under my breath and shut my laptop.

When I got to the conference room, it was already packed.

I didn't even bother listening to the chatter. I grabbed a seat in the corner, pulled out my phone, and went back to my game.

Half an hour later, Matteo and his assistant, Annie Norman, finally walked in.

Annie wore a smug smile, holding a stack of documents.

Matteo quickly scanned the room, his eyes barely resting on me before shifting away.

Then he announced, ""Ms. Norman has an important proposal to share with all of us today.""

Annie cleared her throat and started going on and on about her so-called ""revolutionary"" marketing plan.

I kept playing my game, tuning in here and there, and it just kept sounding more and more ridiculous.

This plan wasn't just super expensive. It also didn't align with our company's market positioning at all.

""...So I really think we should invest 15 million dollars right away and secure the high-end market within three months!""

Annie wrapped up, full of energy.

A few claps echoed in the conference room.

I finally lost my patience. Without even looking up, I said, ""Spending 15 million dollars on pointless exposure is like throwing money off a rooftop‚Äîat least that'd be more exciting and attention-grabbing.""

The whole room went dead silent.

Matteo's eyebrows furrowed slightly.

""What did you just say?"" Annie snapped, her voice jumping up.

I finally looked up and said slowly, ""I said, your plan is full of loopholes.

""Spending 15 million dollars on this is basically flushing money down the toilet.""

Annie's face turned bright red.

She grabbed the latte from the table and stormed toward me in a few quick steps.

""How dare you? You're just a lazy bum, wasting your days playing games in your office, and you actually have the nerve to question my plan?""

She practically yelled that.

Then, with a splash, the cup of latte hit me right in the face.

It dripped down my cheeks and stained my white dress brown in an instant.

Silence swept through the conference room. Everyone seemed to be holding their breath.

""Isabelle Akre, as the CEO's assistant, I hereby fire you. Now get out!""

Chapter 2

Annie looked down at me like I was nothing.

I slowly got up, pulled a handkerchief from my pocket, and started wiping the mess off my face, bit by bit.

Then I turned to Matteo.

He knit his brows, deliberately looked away, and remained silent.

I suddenly burst out laughing.

I spoke into the phone, which was on speaker, ""Dad, did you hear that?

""Someone just told me to get lost.""

There was a two-second pause before a deep, strong voice came through the line.

""I got it. I'll take care of it.""

The only reason I even came to work here was because of that arranged marriage my grandpa set up years ago.

Matteo was my fianc√©.

I never really bought into arranged marriages, but my dad kept bugging me‚Äîeven called me ungrateful to guilt-trip me into saying yes.

So I had no choice but to go along with it.

To help us get closer, my dad suggested I join the Karridge Group.

During those six months working under my fianc√©, sure, I acted like I was slacking off and playing games all day.

But in reality, I was quietly using every resource I could get my hands on to boost the company's performance. I even helped get it listed.

Overnight, the Karridge Group became a shining star in the business world, and Matteo even became one of the wealthiest people in New York.

Even though I did a lot behind the scenes, we barely talked in our daily life.

From the few times we actually went out on dates, I could tell he still thought I was just some woman from an arranged match and had no clue who I really was.

\*\*\*

I plopped back down into the chair at the corner, pulled out my phone, and went right back to the game I was playing earlier.

Annie's face went from flushed red to pale. She clearly didn't expect me to completely ignore her like that.

She slammed her hand on the table, her voice sharp. ""Isabelle! Do you even know where you are?

""Everyone else is paying attention to the meeting, and you're sitting there playing games?""

I smirked and said, ""I already hit my annual performance goal. What's the big deal if I play a little game?""

""If you don't leave right now, I'm calling security!""

Without even looking up, I said, ""Do whatever you want.""

The other executives glanced at each other.

Some quickly looked down and pretended to be flipping through papers, while others secretly glanced at Matteo, waiting to see how he'd react.

Matteo finally got up.

He was dressed in a sharp black suit today, and his expression was totally cold.

He looked at me, clearly a bit annoyed. But mostly just indifferent.

""Isabelle, I'll admit your performance has been solid,"" he said calmly, but with an unquestionable tone.

""But this is a company, not your house.

""Please leave the conference room right now. Don't interrupt the meeting.""

My fingers froze, and my game character died again.

I looked up and met his eyes, a playful smirk tugging at my lips. ""Mr. Karridge, are you really sure you want to kick me out?""

Matteo's face tightened, and his voice got even colder.

""I don't feel like saying this twice. If you had even a little professionalism, you'd know where the line is.""

""What if I don't feel like leaving?""

""Then don't come crying to me when I get tough.""

Seeing that Matteo was backing her up, Annie suddenly got more confident.

She stormed over, took a quick step toward me, and slapped the phone right out of my hand.

It hit the floor with a crack, the screen shattering into a web of fine cracks.

""Isabelle, don't be shameless!""

She grabbed my collar and yanked it up.

""Mr. Karridge already said so. Why are you still hanging around? Get out!""

Annie had disliked me from the moment she became an assistant.

Once, as I walked past the CEO's office, I caught her mid-rant. ""Mr. Karridge, the company isn't a charity organization. It's not fair to other employees to keep spending so much on someone who just sits around playing games all day.""

Her voice wasn't loud, but just loud enough for me to hear outside.

Matteo did not respond.

But through the window, I saw him pause for a second, his hand stopped flipping through the documents.

Since then, Annie's been getting worse and worse.

She started 'accidentally' bringing up my so-called 'amazing work' in department meetings.

""You know, some people get paid a ton but don't even show up to meetings. It's hard to tell if they're here to work or just on a paid vacation.""

Rumors about me slowly began spreading around the office.

Some said I was a spoiled rich girl who got hired through connections. Others claimed I just napped in my office all day. And a few even made bets on when I'd finally get the boot.

I knew all about it, but I just couldn't be bothered to care.

Chapter 3

But the more I ignored her, the more she pushed her luck.

She totally lost her cool and took full advantage of the moment.

I wasn't about to let her have her way. I grabbed her wrist and twisted it hard.

""Ah!""

Annie let out a sharp cry and automatically let go of my collar.

The second she pulled back, her arm hit the edge of the conference table. Her watch clinked loudly against the wooden surface.

She stumbled back a couple of steps, looked down, and turned completely pale.

There was a big scratch right across the face of her expensive Patek Philippe, and under the light, it was impossible to miss.

""You... you...""

Her wrist trembled as she lifted it up, her eyes burning with rage like she was about to explode.

""Isabelle, do you even know how much this watch is worth?

""This was a birthday gift from Mr. Karridge! It cost 150,000 dollars!""

I slowly fixed my messed-up collar.

""You can't really blame anyone for not standing steadily.""

""Isabelle!"" Matteo finally snapped, his voice sharp and loud, ""You've gone too far this time!

""You not only ruined the meeting, but now you've gone and damaged someone else's stuff on purpose.

""In my capacity as CEO, I'm officially firing you.

""Pack your things and get out now!""

Annie jumped in aggressively, ""Mr. Karridge, we can't just let her walk away! She has to pay for the watch!""

The conference room was completely silent.

Everyone was staring at me, some with pity, others with an excited look in their eyes, like they were waiting for a good show.

""Fine, I'll cover it.

""150,000 dollars, right?""

I bent down and picked up my broken phone.

The screen was cracked, but it still worked.

I dialed a number and was about to speak when Annie cut in with a smirk, ""What 150,000 dollars? It's 1.5 million dollars!""

I stopped and turned to her.

""Are you sure about that?""

""Of course I'm sure!"" Annie shot back arrogantly. ""This gift from Mr. Karridge is priceless!

""Making you pay just 1.5 million dollars is already being way too generous!

""Go ahead, ask anyone! Am I right or not?""

Annie wouldn't let it go.

She knew exactly what I earned and that there was no way I could ever afford that kind of money.

She was just trying to make me look bad and embarrass me as much as possible.

Seeing this, the other executives started jumping in one by one.

""Come on, how can you even put a price on a gift from Mr. Karridge?"" The CFO pushed up his glasses. ""Ms. Akre, you should just admit it.""

""The company isn't a charity organization,"" the Marketing Director smirked. ""Of course, you should pay for what you broke. But with your salary? I bet you'd still be paying it off when you retire, right?""

The room exploded in laughter, their eyes full of mockery and gloating.

They'd never liked me‚Äîthe so-called lazy girl‚Äîand now that I was in trouble, of course, they were more than happy to kick me while I was down.

Matteo stood off to the side, his eyebrows slightly furrowed, but he didn't say a word to stop what was happening.

Facing all the sneers and mockery, I wasn't even angry. I looked straight at Annie and said, ""1.5 million dollars, right? You won't try to squeeze more out of me, will you?""

Annie froze for a second, then let out a sharp laugh.

""Isabelle, come on. Who are you trying to fool at a time like this?

""What's your monthly salary again?

""1.5 million dollars? You're gonna spend your whole life paying it off?""

I ignored her and picked up my phone.

""Get 1.5 million dollars in cash ready for me and send it over to the Karridge Group conference room as soon as possible.""

Annie rolled her eyes. ""Tsk, pretending to make some big move? You think a random phone call is gonna fool anyone?""

I didn't say anything. I just waited quietly.

Within ten minutes, the conference room door swung open, and a sharply dressed middle-aged man walked in.

Right behind him were three bank clerks in uniform, each carrying a suitcase.

He came straight over to me, gave a respectful bow, and said, ""Ms. Akre, here's the 1.5 million dollars you asked for.""

I gave a small nod.

""Thanks for the trouble. Just put it here.""

As the three suitcases were opened one by one, neatly stacked hundred-dollar bills caught the light‚Äîshining almost too bright to look at.

The room went completely silent. Everyone was staring at the money, completely frozen.

It felt like all the air had been sucked out, and even the sound of breathing grew quieter.

Annie's face turned pale, and she couldn't say a word.

She stared at the cash like she couldn't believe it, then looked up at the man in the suit.

Suddenly, the CFO turned white with shock.

""Mr. Harlan?""

Chapter 4

William Harlan was the President of Evercrest Bank's New York Headquarters.

This was someone so high up that even Matteo's grandfather, Hugo Karridge, would usually have a hard time getting a meeting with him. And yet, here he was, standing politely in front of me, calling me ""Ms. Akre.""

Matteo hesitated for a few seconds, then quickly stepped forward and reached out to shake his hand.

""Mr. Harlan, why come all the way here in person?

""My grandfather's been asking about you. He'd really like to see you again.""

William didn't even look at him. He just gave a quick nod.

Then he turned back to me and said, ""Ms. Akre, if you need anything else, feel free to reach out anytime.""

With that, he turned on his heel and left the conference room with his people.

He didn't stick around for even an extra second‚Äîlike every moment spent there was too precious to waste.

Matteo's hand hung in the air, frozen. His face turned red, then pale.

Annie's confidence completely vanished.

Her legs were shaking so badly she could barely stand, and sweat was already forming on her forehead.

I slowly reached into the suitcase, grabbed a stack of cash like it was nothing, and gently slapped her face with it.

""Ms. Norman, that's 1.5 million dollars‚Äînot a single penny missing.

""And now, this watch is mine.""

Without another word, I yanked the Patek Philippe right off her wrist and tossed it straight into the trash can in front of her.

""You!""

Annie's eyes practically popped out of her head with rage.

I turned to Matteo and gave a small smile.

""Mr. Karridge, I've already covered the cost of the watch.

""Now, let's talk about compensating for my phone.""

Annie froze for a second, then a sarcastic smile spread across her face, like she'd just heard the funniest thing ever.

She folded her arms and said with a sneer, ""How much could a Luminae XR even be worth?""

I held up one finger.

""It's not that expensive, really‚Äîjust 20 million dollars.""

The whole room exploded into noise, followed by bursts of laughter.

The Marketing Director even slammed the table. ""20 million dollars? Ms. Akre, did that cup of latte flow into your brain or something?""

The CFO pushed up his glasses and tried to sound serious as he threw in another jab. ""According to company rules, damaged items should be compensated at market value.

""Ms. Akre, I'm afraid the market price of your phone doesn't even come close to a few thousand dollars.""

Seeing everyone back her up, Annie got even more smug.

She stepped closer and said with a smirk, ""How about I do you a favor and help you find a mental hospital?

""After all, delusions are a kind of illness, and they do require treatment.""

Matteo stayed quiet off to the side, his eyebrows furrowed tightly.

Facing all their sneers and jokes, I stayed completely calm.

""You're right. A regular Luminae XR really isn't worth much.""

Annie let out a sharp laugh. ""Good, at least you know. Stop embarrassing yourself already!""

""But unfortunately, this isn't a regular phone.""

As soon as the words left my mouth, the conference room door swung open again.

This time, a middle-aged man in a gray jacket walked in, followed by eight bodyguards.

It was Adam Gibson‚ÄîAshcroft Global's senior vice president, a guy who usually only showed up at big press events.

Matteo's expression changed in an instant. He quickly stepped forward.

""Mr. Gibson? What are you doing here?""",4,1756580392.0,Novelnews,2,1.0,False

I barely had time to find the coffee machine before I was suddenly out‚Äîno warning, no real reason, no compensation. Just done. I picked myself up and moved on.

Flash forward to this June: my old manager pops up. Says he wants me back. At first, I refused; who wants to board the same sinking ship twice? But reality bites‚Äîjob offers weren‚Äôt exactly falling from the sky. So I agreed to meet. I asked for a 30% raise (honestly, more sanity-check than negotiation tactic). He said he‚Äôd ask the ""main boss.""

Twenty days of silence. Then‚Äîbam‚Äîthe job‚Äôs ‚Äúput on hold.‚Äù I pretty much expected it. I told him, ‚ÄúThis feels disrespectful.‚Äù He apologized.

A week later, same story: he circles back again. I agree to meet, but this time, I ask for a simple severance clause. If they let me go again, two months‚Äô pay. He said yes, but after I followed up? Suddenly management wouldn‚Äôt sign off. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt proceed.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt help but wonder if the main boss feels I‚Äôm trying to leverage the situation‚Äîasking for a 30% raise and a severance clause might seem like pushing too hard. Maybe it feels like I‚Äôm making demands instead of just coming back to work. But honestly, isn‚Äôt wanting some stability and respect too much to ask?

So, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm struggling with: If a company isn‚Äôt willing to commit‚Äîto even the most basic request for stability‚Äîwhy start these back-and-forths at all? Why reach out, court me, negotiate, dodge, and disappear? What's with expecting loyalty on their terms but not offering any in return?

I‚Äôm not angry. Just tired. Tired of vague signals and wasted time. Tired of feeling like asking for basic respect is asking for too much. Boundaries matter‚Äîso does my time.

Not every open door is worth walking through. If this loop sounds familiar‚Äîif you‚Äôve ever found yourself replaying these awkward, unfinished conversations‚ÄîI‚Äôd honestly love to know how you handled it.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Trinbago Knight Riders vs. Guyana Amazon Warriors: A Tale of Two Titans (and One Very Old Grandpa)**

The Caribbean Premier League‚Äôs latest clash pits the red-hot Trinbago Knight Riders against the age-defying Guyana Amazon Warriors. Let‚Äôs dissect this matchup with the precision of a spin bowler and the humor of a stand-up comedian who‚Äôs had one too many rum punches.

**Parsing the Odds: Math, Not Magic**  
The bookmakers have priced this as a near-50-50 battle, with Guyana at **2.05** (48.78% implied probability) and Trinbago at **1.74** (57.47%). That 8.7% gap suggests Trinbago is the slight favorite, but not by much‚Äîlike a tight Test match in Trinidad where the outcome hinges on whether the referee‚Äôs coffee was strong enough.

Why the tight line? Trinbago‚Äôs **four wins from five games** and their **top-of-the-table NRR (0.618)** scream dominance. Colin Munro, their Swiss Army knife of a batter, is the CPL‚Äôs leading run-scorer (283 runs at 177.98 strike rate). Meanwhile, Guyana‚Äôs **Imran Tahir**, cricket‚Äôs answer to a time-traveling wizard, has taken **12 wickets at 8.00 economy**‚Äîproof that 46-year-old ‚Äúgrandpas‚Äù can still outwit kids half their age.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and Metaphors**  
Trinbago‚Äôs recent 7-wicket thrashing of Barbados was a masterclass in efficiency. Colin Munro (67 off 44) and Nicholas Pooran (65 off 40, six sixes) formed a **93-run partnership** that made the Royals‚Äô bowlers look like they‚Äôd forgotten how to bowl. With Munro‚Äôs bat and Andre Russell‚Äôs bowling (3/37 in the last game), they‚Äôre a machine built for tight T20s.

Guyana, meanwhile, is led by Tahir, who‚Äôs like the ‚Äúgrandpa in a superhero movie‚Äù who still kicks butt. His experience could exploit the \*\*Brian Lara Stadium

This morning me and my bf woke up to the living room in a mess because of our cats. We have 3 male cats (2yo, 1yo and 4 months ). The youngest cat still has problems with learning what he can or cant do. My bf has around 50 plants and every few nights without fail the youngest cat destroies a few of them. He bites them, digs in the dirt, breaks their stems or pushes them to the floor. my bf cares about his plants alot and cares for them every day. He also cares about our cats and loves them alot. We dont do any negative discipline on them( kick or push them in any way when they do bad things, we just firmly say NO when they are doing something bad, that worked on the first 2 cats)

My bf works 2 jobs, very often sleeps 2-3 hours a night, doesnt have time to eat and would probably starve himself because he forgets to eat if i dont cook for us( i dont mind cooking i love to do it, i cook he cleans after). 

The mess the cats make happens often, we both understand that they need to learn, but today he got mad( he usually doesnt). I heard my bf in the living room saying Oh no, when i came in a saw the plants all over the place. i Asked what happened( stupid question since i know what happened) and he was just mad he had to fix the mess once again. He angrly said I will put them on the street. I was so surprised and told him instantly to never say thata again and that he shouldnt speak like that untill he calms down. 

1 hours passed, he fixed the plants and i made us coffee and cleaned a bit because the other cat made a mess in the bathroom. We sat downg to talk and after 5 minutes of talking he instantly apologized for saying that, he explaind that it wasnt just the plants, that they chew on cables also and that every day he has to fix the same problems (he had to throw away a few plants because they would thestroy them beyond repair.). He said he would never trow them in the street, that he loves them alot and he said that because he was angry, and he understanda he should never speak like that ever. he also apologized to the cats haha. 

my problem is that he never said anything of this sorts and it threw me off guard. He is a very loving and caring person and its hard to thinks he would say somtehing like this. I told him that its hard for me to act like he didnt say that and he said i shouldnt pretend he didnt say it and that he understand my pain and why im overthinking it. He apologized 10 more times after. 

now i dont know what to do with this feeling, its h ard for me to hear something like that because i was in an abusive relationship before him( verbally abusive). So im not sure if im overreacting because of ny past. 

he is truly sorry i can see it on him and he. took full resposibility for saying that. i also know he would never throw them out, he is not that kind of person, but just hearing that hurt my feelings alot ",2,1756580054.0,AIO,7,0.75,False

I feel like I have had a few good months of only waiting 1-2 weeks but it has now been over 2 weeks with no end in sight. I just got off the phone with the pharmacy to check and they said they have no idea when it would be in but I could call other pharmacies. I did that before and felt like everyone I called thought I was some drug seeker. Surprise! They never had any either.

It was hard before but I had a baby in January and now I‚Äôm miserable without it. I cannot get anything done, I lose everything, and everything I can manage to do is half done. Don‚Äôt even get me started on how work is going. It was already awful since I got back from maternity leave. 

My mood swings the first few weeks of not having my meds are terrible. Like I cannot control them at all and feel almost manic? Like I‚Äôm unusually irritable, want to pick fights with everyone, feel out of control, and spend way more money than usual. üò´ I hate who I am without it and I hate that lawmakers or the FDA OR WHOEVER IT IS  (I can‚Äôt even remember who is causing the problem was it‚Äôs been so freaking long we‚Äôve been dealing with this) get to ruin my life.

I recently did some fuel consumption testing with a fairly common canister stove setup (MSR Pocket Rocket Deluxe + Toaks 750ml with stock lid), in preparation for a Wind River High Route trip.

I boiled fourteen 250ml batches of water (amount of water used in typical 1p dehydrated meal pouches and morning coffee), plus two 450ml batches of water (amount of water used in typical 2p dehydrated meal pouches). After these sixteen boils, I had enough fuel remaining to warm, but not boil, a 250ml batch of water. All the water came from a bowl of ice water that I added ice to and let sit until the ice stopped melting, to simulate a glacial meltwater source at 32f. I stopped each test once I reached a rolling boil.

**TLDR - if you're boiling glacial melt water (ie near freezing start temps), you can expect to get fourteen 250ml boils plus two 450ml boils out of a 100g MSR IsoPro fuel canister using this pot/stove setup in wind-free conditions.**

Adjust your expectations accordingly if you are using warmer water sources, or if you'll be frequently boiling water in windy conditions.

Every morning I plop toddler in the stroller, wrap up the baby, and head out. Yesterday we grabbed coffee and a treat, met with a friend at the park, had a stroller nap by the river, stopped by the library, met up with uncle for ice cream, and had dinner at a friends house ‚Äî all without ever piling into a car. 

Whenever someone asks ‚Äúhow do you do it??‚Äù I answer ‚Äúbought a house in a walkable city.‚Äù I have no other hacks and no idea how I would do this otherwise.

The usual happened with us. We met and there was instant deep connection. Thought it would be different this time around. That she would be in my life for a while. We had similar values and experiences in life. She said she wanted the same thing as me like an active friendship and frequent communication. 

I expressed (and still do) that I want active friendships. Not the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get a coffee and each have a monologue to summarize the last 3 months of our lives‚Äù. My goal is to have actual new memories and do things and go to events. 

Realized I was the one putting most of the effort. The messages. The initiating of hangout or phone call. She is caught up in her own crises of life, work, and money. Still is. Her reasoning; ‚ÄúMy mental health isn‚Äôt good. I can‚Äôt message or talk to you or anyone.‚Äù

Ok. I stepped back to not be a burden. Before that, I expressed my desire to help and even did things like calls, send a small gift, listening to her for 1 or 2 hours. But it became unequal. I stopped all of that to see if she would step up and start initiating. No. Nothing. 
So I have been letting the friendship fade. No fight or argument. Just the slow fade. 

Now i see tomorrow‚Äôs date. It is significant to her and therefore to me. I have been itching all week to write to her. I guess to say hi, reconnect, because I truly do care and want this friendship to succeed. 

But the saying ‚Äúif they want to, they will‚Äù is so true. She has time to post on social media and make content, but zero time for me. I‚Äôm not priority. And ok it is how it is. But the desire to write on the monumental day is burning. 

I wonder if I will regret not reaching out. This person was like a sibling. But I also know writing and waiting for a response may open a wound and leave me tender and not enough. 

I can only hope this same day next year will be less raw and heavy. And maybe she won‚Äôt even be a thought. So my focus less on who I wish she and our friendship could be, and more the reality of what little it is.

1n492cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1n492cw/should_you_buy_the_best_compact_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Best Compact Coffee Maker Elite Gourmet,"Testing out the Elite Gourmet EHC4128 was a daily ritual that quickly became second nature. As someone always on the go, having a compact coffee maker that fits seamlessly into my kitchen was a game-changer. This Elite Gourmet coffee maker is part of my early morning routine, and its strong design and practical features make it a worthwhile addition to smaller kitchen spaces, dorms, or RVs.

**Stylish, Compact Design**

The first thing you‚Äôll notice is how sleek and space-friendly this coffee maker looks. Measuring just 8 inches deep, 9 inches wide, and 6 inches high, it‚Äôs perfect for any countertop without making it feel cluttered. I loved how its modern aesthetic complemented my minimalistic kitchen setup. If you‚Äôre working with tight spaces or looking for something portable, it‚Äôs a great fit. The black finish adds a touch of sophistication, blending well with most kitchen d√©cor.

**Convenient Brewing Experience**

Brew quality coffee without unnecessary hassle. The fully automatic operation mode simplifies the process, and you‚Äôll appreciate how straightforward the setup is. Every morning, I‚Äôd measure water, pop in the reusable filter, and let the machine do its thing. The semi-transparent water reservoir‚Äîdesigned to hold up to four cups‚Äîis a feature I heavily relied on, especially since the level indicator ensured I was never second-guessing the water amount. It‚Äôs the little details, like this, that make the brewing process stress-free.

**Pause 'N Serve and Speedy Coffee Fixes**

What really stands out is the ""Pause 'N Serve"" function. This feature lets you pour a quick cup mid-brew‚Äîideal when I‚Äôm in a rush (which is most of the time). Whenever I couldn‚Äôt wait for the entire brewing process to finish, this feature saved me from standing around impatiently. It‚Äôs perfect for individuals with chaotic mornings or those who simply hate waiting.

[Check Elite Gourmet EHC4128 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0czqctd4k/)

**Upsides**

The coffee maker has plenty of strengths that make it a reliable appliance for everyday use:  

- The reusable filter is eco-friendly and reduces the need for disposable paper filters. Plus, it‚Äôs incredibly easy to clean.  
- Glass carafe holds enough coffee for small groups or solo indulgence while keeping the coffee hot and fresh.
- Keep-warm function activates right after the brewing cycle, ensuring every cup stays at the perfect temperature.  

**Shortcomings**

Although the product has its benefits, there are areas of concern that some users might find limiting:  

- It lacks advanced programmability found in higher-end models, so you can‚Äôt schedule an automatic brew ahead of time.  
- The glass carafe isn‚Äôt insulated, which means the coffee will cool faster if not left on the warming plate.  
- The 4-cup capacity might not suffice for families or heavy coffee drinkers.  

**Competing Products**

This coffee maker holds its ground against similar-sized contenders in the market. For instance, when compared to the Mr. Coffee Mini Brew, the Elite Gourmet EHC4128 edges out with its durable glass carafe and reusable filter. However, another competitor, the Black+Decker 5-Cup Coffee Maker, might appeal to those who prefer slightly larger brewing capacities or machines with programmable timers. Despite these options, the simplicity and eco-friendliness of the Elite Gourmet make it better suited for users seeking a hassle-free, budget-friendly coffee machine.

**Cost Efficiency**

Speaking of cost-efficiency, I found this coffee maker to deliver a fantastic price-to-quality ratio. Its sturdy design, combined with practical features like the pause function and reusable filter, makes it a worthwhile investment for students, professionals, or anyone working with a tight budget. While its basic features might not cater to coffee connoisseurs, it‚Äôs a solid pick for its target audience. Additionally, the long-lasting components ensure you‚Äôre not scrambling for replacements anytime soon.

Imagine waking up, sipping your coffee, and letting **AI** do the heavy lifting while you focus on creativity! That‚Äôs a dream sitch right there, isn‚Äôt it?

**What‚Äôs Your Niche?**
Now, you might be wondering, *""What can I actually create?""* Well, think about your passions! Here are some ideas that can get your creativity flowing:

1. **Blogging**: Write about what you love. Share your thoughts, experiences, hacks, or even reviews. Bonus points if you mix it up with some video!
   
2. **Online courses**: Have a skill? Teach it! Use platforms like Teachable and pair it with AI tools for content design.
   
3. **Social media influencer**: Build a brand around your personality! Use AI to draft engaging posts and plan your content calendar.

4. **Digital art**: Create art or design assets and sell them on websites like Etsy or Creative Market. AI art generators make it even easier!

**Overcoming Fear of Failure**
Here‚Äôs the thing: *Every success story starts with a ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù* You might worry about failing or not making money right away. But have you ever heard of the 1% rule? Just ask yourself:

- What‚Äôs your goal?
- What can you do *today* to move closer to it?
- (Bonus) What do you have to lose? ü§ë

There‚Äôs comfort in knowing that you're part of a growing community of creators. You won't be alone in this journey. Want to hear something cool? Even the pros started small‚Äîsome were even in 9-to-5 jobs just *like you* not too long ago. 

So, what‚Äôs stopping you? Maybe it‚Äôs time to trade in those dress shoes for some comfy slippers and start creating some magic. Think about it‚Äî *who wouldn‚Äôt want to ditch the grind and make a living on their own terms?* 

Keep hustling, keep dreaming, and remember: in the world of AI tools, the sky's the limit! üåü‚ú®",2,1756578822.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1n48w62,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductPerspectives/comments/1n48w62/should_you_try_windex_vinegar_multisurface/,Should You Try Windex Vinegar Multi-Surface Cleaner Refill Now,"Testing household cleaning products is almost second nature to me, given that I'm constantly juggling the balance between keeping my home tidy and finding efficient tools to help. The WINDEX Vinegar Multi-Surface Cleaner Refill, DOT726806PK2, has been one of the latest products I've been trying out. With a solid reputation behind the Windex name and the promise of a vinegar-based, ammonia-free formula, I had high hopes as I introduced this multi-surface cleaner into my daily cleaning routine.

**Ease of Use and Design**  
One of the things that stood out almost immediately was the product's no-nonsense packaging. The refill comes in a large 2-liter container that's optimized for convenience, providing enough cleaning solution to last through multiple uses without running out too soon. It's a lifesaver for someone like me who prefers avoiding constant trips to restock supplies. The cap design makes it easy to pour the solution into my spray bottle without causing a mess, which I‚Äôve found to be an issue with some other cleaners. Plus, its vinegar-based formula is a win for anyone looking for an alternative to harsh-smelling ammonia cleaners.  

**Performance on Glass Surfaces**  
Using the product on my windows and mirrors was where it really started to shine‚Äîpun intended. I often struggle with streaks and smudges left behind by subpar window cleaners, but this one claimed to leave a streak-free finish. After testing it on my large living room windows, I was genuinely impressed; the smudges and fingerprints wiped right off, leaving the glass crystal clear. It makes such a difference when the sunlight streams in, and there‚Äôs no annoying residue disrupting the view.  

**Check WINDEX Vinegar Multi-Surface Cleaner DOT726806PK2 price on Amazon.**

**Versatility Across Multiple Surfaces**  
In addition to glass surfaces, I experimented with it on various areas around my home to see just how ""multi-surface"" the cleaner really is. It worked impeccably on my kitchen countertops, wiping away grease from cooking and dealing with coffee stains on my dining table. I even tried it on some smudged picture frames and chrome faucets, both of which came out gleaming. I did notice, however, that while it‚Äôs marketed as safe for all-glass surfaces, you‚Äôll want to test it on delicate materials just in case. That said, I had no issues with streaking or residue on any of the surfaces I cleaned.  

**Strengths**  
- Intuitive and mess-free refill packaging  
- Effectively removes smudges and fingerprints  
- Streak-free results, even on glass  
- Gentle vinegar-based formula without harsh ammonia odor  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Limited use around delicate or untreated surfaces: Some caution is necessary when using on specialized materials.  
- The product‚Äôs size, while economical, may be slightly bulky for storage if you have limited cabinet space.  

**Competing Brands**  
When considering other options, I couldn‚Äôt help but think of the Method Glass Cleaner and Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs Clean Day products, both of which I've used in the past. The Method cleaner offers a plant-based, eco-friendly solution that aligns with green cleaning preferences, though it often struggles with tougher grime and can leave residue at times. Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs, on the other hand, is lovely for casual cleaning with its various scent options, but it doesn‚Äôt match the streak-free shine I consistently get from the Windex cleaner. As far as price-to-quality is concerned, the WINDEX Vinegar Multi-Surface Cleaner finds a happy medium‚Äîit‚Äôs affordable yet incredibly effective.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Speaking of cost, this product feels like a practical investment, especially with the 2-liter refill lasting for months in my household. Compared to other cleaners of similar quality, it offers long-term usability, making it hard to justify spending more on brands that deliver equal or lesser effectiveness. If you‚Äôre in search of an efficient and streak-free cleaner without breaking the bank, this one certainly delivers the bang for your buck.

1n48uln,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1n48uln/should_you_try_the_best_cold_brew_coffee_maker_by/,Should You Try the Best Cold Brew Coffee Maker by Takeya,"The Takeya 10310 Cold Brew Coffee Maker immediately caught my eye due to its sleek, minimalist design and the promise of delivering a richer, smoother cold brew coffee experience. As a daily coffee drinker who loves experimenting with brewing methods, I decided to put this product to the test. After weeks of trying different coffee grounds, settings, and storage options, I can confidently share the highs and lows of this product, as well as who might benefit the most from adding it to their kitchen.

**Convenient and Functional Design**  
This cold brew coffee maker gets points for practicality. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit into most refrigerator doors without jamming next to the milk or juice cartons, and that‚Äôs a win in my packed kitchen. The non-slip silicone handle is a small but thoughtful touch that makes pouring feel secure, especially early in the morning when I‚Äôm still half-asleep. Its BPA-free Tritan construction feels solid and lightweight, and the transparency of the pitcher makes it effortless to monitor how much coffee you have left. While the black color of the lid and handle keeps it looking chic, I found myself wishing for a few more color options‚Äîmaybe something a tad brighter to match my more colorful kitchenware.

**Strong Performing Coffee Infuser**  
If you‚Äôve never dipped your toes into the world of cold brew coffee, this device will make you wonder why you waited so long. The reusable fine-mesh coffee filter does a stellar job of keeping those pesky coffee grounds where they belong‚Äîinside the filter and not floating in my mug. I tried different grind sizes, from espresso-fine to coarse, and the filter impressed me by accommodating them all without clogging. Unlike other cold brew systems, the infuser leaves minimal sediment behind, ensuring a clean and smooth coffee every time. The flavor profile? Well, it managed to extract rich, bold notes while reducing acidity, which is perfect for people like me who occasionally battle with heartburn from traditional hot coffee.

[Find the best price for Takeya 10310 Cold Brew Coffee Maker on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b00ffly64u/)

**Airtight Seal for Flavor and Freshness**  
One aspect that stood out is the patented leak-proof lid. On more than one occasion, I found myself tipping the pitcher around to test its claim of being airtight (I like to live dangerously). Not a single drop leaked, which is great for storing my cold brew in the fridge or even laying the pitcher horizontally when space was tight. This feature also retained the freshness of the brew for about a week, though honestly, I usually finished mine within four to five days.

**Durability and Easy Maintenance**  
With regular use, I was apprehensive about how the material would hold up, especially since I‚Äôm guilty of tossing kitchen gadgets into the dishwasher without a second thought. The Takeya Tritan body turned out to be dishwasher safe and stayed free of stains or odors even after weeks of use. It‚Äôs rare to find a cold brew maker that doesn't retain any hint of coffee smell after repeated cleanings, so this definitely scored some bonus points from me. However, while dishwasher-safe features make cleaning a breeze, I found that the filter required a bit of extra effort to rinse thoroughly, particularly after using finely ground coffee.

**Upsides**  
- Effortless brewing process making it beginner-friendly  
- Airtight, leak-proof lid maintains flavor and prevents spills  
- Sleek design fits refrigerator doors seamlessly  
- Durable and odor-proof BPA-free Tritan pitcher  
- Reusable fine-mesh filter minimizes sediment for clean brews  

**Downsides**  
- Filter can be tricky to clean if using fine coffee grounds  
- Lack of color options could make it less visually appealing for some  
- One-quart size may not be sufficient for heavy coffee drinkers or larger households  

**Competing Products**  
For those who like to weigh their options, I compared this coffee maker to offerings like the Hario Mizudashi Cold Brew Coffee Maker and the OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker. The Hario is more visually appealing with its glass body, but it‚Äôs prone to breaking‚Äîa risk I‚Äôd rather not take with clumsy hands. The OXO, on the other hand, features a larger capacity and an automatic draining system, but that comes at the expense of taking up more counter or fridge space. The Takeya 10310 strikes a middle ground between these products, especially for those prioritizing a durable, compact design with a reliable flavor payoff.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Considering the simplicity of its design coupled with its durability and high-performance filter, this cold brew coffee maker offers solid value for its price. With proper care, it looks like an investment that will last years without replacement parts. I might argue it‚Äôs more affordable than paying for a week‚Äôs worth of cold brew from a boutique coffee shop. Still, for heavy coffee consumers or larger households, the limited capacity could necessitate additional brewing, slightly lowering its appeal from a cost-efficiency perspective.

Okay, I know I'm overthinking this. But I'm used to hearing back pretty quickly from places when the interview went really well. I've heard back the same day only a couple hours after the interview at 2 seperate administrative positions I've had.

This job was for an Executive Assistant, which would be an amped up version of what I've already been doing. They made it clear they're open to people who haven't been EAs in the past (they're paying entry level anyway, below national average) and they seemed impressed enough by my experience. The interview went really well in my opinion. I figured out my responded to questions well in advance to the interview, and I was prepared to answer a lot more than they even ended up asking.

I didn't hear back Thursday or Friday though, and for some reason I was convinced I'd hear back by the end of the week. Now I'm going through all the possible things I might've done wrong.

Did I overdress, for example??? I stressed a lot about my outfit, but only because I anticipated this being a corporate setting. I was prior to the interview that I'd be meeting with the CEO and the COO directly, so surely I needed to look the part. I have some dresses, some nice blouses, trousers, etc., but I wanted to wear a blazer because I wanted to look crisp and clean.

I also have a bigger bust and wide hips and I didn't want it drawing any attention, so I my shirt is a little oversized and makes me look especially blocky, along with my blazer hiding the sides of my body. But now I'm worried I looked overdressed???They stressed that they didn't want someone that felt they would be ""too good for this position"", because they've said some people retorted it as a ""glorified coffee runner"", but honestly I don't care because it would've been higher pay than I've made before.

Did I look goofy wearing a blazer suit to an assistant interview??? My interviewers ended up not being the CEO and COO as originally planned (they had a meeting I guess), and were wearing bit more relaxed/casual office wear. I feel a little embarrassed for how I dressed now and I'm not sure if it hurt my chances at all.

I also brought a pad folio to take notes in, and a planner that I had questions written down in (it's a full-focus planner if any of you are familiar) because I wanted to seem well structured and organized (EAs are very organization-centric).

TL;DR Do I still have hope of getting the position even though I haven't heard back since my interview Wednesday? Did I overdress for the position (executive assistant) or dress poorly for my body type? Am I just overthinking things?",2,1756578313.0,jobs,5,0.67,False

The biggest news to come out of the West Virginia football program during the offseason was the return of head coach Rich Rodriguez. This is his second time as the head coach of the Mountaineers. The last time he was in Morgantown the team had its best three-year stretch in school history.



Last season, the Mountaineers finished with a 6-7 record, but were 5-4 in conference play. The team lost 42-37 in the Miami Beach Bowl to the Memphis Tigers.



The Roberts Morris Colonials finished last season with a 7-5 record in the Northeast Conference. The university has brought in a handful of power conference transfers this fall, which has Robert Morris predicted to finish third in the Northeast this season.

WVU is a perfect 24-0 against FCS teams, while the Colonials have never taken down an FBS opponent.

This is an excellent college football matchup that you will not want to miss. Make sure to tune in and catch all the action.

1n48gp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Napoleon/comments/1n48gp0/the_controversial_suicide_of_napoleons/,"The Controversial Suicide of Napoleon‚Äôs grandnephew, Count de Camerata","Charles F√©lix Jean-Baptiste Camerata-Passionei di Mazzoleni was born in 1826. His mother was Elisa Napoleone Baciocchi, daughter of Elisa Bonaparte and Felice Baciocchi, and niece of Napoleon. His father was Filippo Camerata-Passionei di Mazzoleni.

He was described as having been ‚Äúbeloved by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance. He greatly distinguished himself at Court by the tact and ability which he displayed as State Councillor. This position he attained, not by mere favour, but through his undoubted merit, which every one recognized.‚Äù

On 4 March 1853, less than a year after the restoration of the Empire, Camerata was found dead in his room.The New York Times reported of his death that:
>The Count de Camerata, second cousin of the Emperor, shot himself last Friday morning. He was ma√Ætre des requ√™tes at the Council of State. No one knows the cause of this suicide. Every one guesses and surmises. No two surmises are alike, and no one worth repeating. His body was deposited, with as little public ceremony as possible, in the vaults of the Madelaine.

As the NYT makes clear, nobody knew the exact circumstances behind his death, and they remain unclear even to this day.
Theo Aronson writes in his book ‚ÄúThe Golden Bees‚Äù that: 
>A few days later a beautiful young actress, Elisa Letessier, known professionally , as Mile. Marthe, took her own life by means, it was reported, of a pan of charcoal. A week or so afterwards a member of the French secret police, Zembo by name, was found under Hungerford Bridge in London with a dagger through his heart. These three deaths set Second Empire Paris seething with rumors.

>The most generally accepted story was that young Camerata, finding himself hopelessly in debt, had committed suicide, and that Elisa Letessier, heartbroken at his death, had done the same. The announcement of the marriage of the Emperor to Eugenie de Montijo had led to something very like panic on the Bourse, and it was said that Count Camerata had lost a great deal of money on that occasion. Having appealed in vain to his rich mother, Napoleone Camerata (who had now reverted to her title of Princess Bacciochi) and to Jerome, who, it was claimed, owed him money at the time, he took his own life. 

Caroline Laetitia Murat in her memoir, however, writing many decades after the fact, recounts her experience as follows:

>One morning my valet de chambre came and knocked at my door saying that they wished me to go without delay to the Rue de la Ville L'fiveque. I feared a misfortune. Alas! my fears were too well founded. The young Count Camerata was dead. I was taken in to see him. Never shall I forget the sight of his lifeless body stretched out on his little iron bedstead, the eye blown out of his head, his fearful wound still open and bleeding. But no ; I stop here. I cannot write down the horror of that morning.

>...The current rumour was that Camerata was deeply in debt, that he had speculated heavily on the Stock Exchange, and that neither the allowance that the Emperor made him nor his mother's resources at the moment would be sufficient to cover the enormous deficits that settling day must reveal. It was said that the poor boy had lost a very large sum : that he had to find 200,000 francs by the next morning. He was believed to have had recourse so often to the Emperor's generous and frequent goodness that he dared not in these circumstances make an appeal to him. What could be done ? At the end of his resources, half mad, he went, it was said, to the Empress at the Tuileries and threw himself at the feet of her Majesty, entreating her help. Nothing came of it. It was reported that she received him coldly, refused him all assistance, threw in his teeth the generosity of the Emperor, of which he had, she said, so often taken unfair advantage. Then, in a frenzy of despair, he flung himself out of her private boudoir, leaving her as a farewell the words, "" If I do not find two hundred thousand francs this evening, I shall blow my brains out!‚Äù

>...The Count Camerata received no money that night. He went to bed. He awoke early, asked for his coffee, had his hair dressed, and sent his valet to fetch a newspaper. During his servant's absence, the thing happened. How?

>The Emperor was on the throne ; Camerata was his cousin ; and nevertheless‚Äîthanks always to her who decided on his life‚Äîthey buried him like a dog. A military van came to take the body of the most amiable, the most charming of youths, and they carried it away in this manner. I do not believe that they allowed even a prayer !
(Caroline‚Äôs story of his burial is corroborated by the NYT article)

>There is another version of the tragedy. The two stories are not contradictory. I am not prepared to say which represents the truth... I have not access to the records of the Secret Service‚Ä¶ It was stated that on a certain evening, at an important Court function, as he stood with the hand of a very great lady on his arm, Camerata was indiscreet enough to say to her in Italian, ""I love you"" in tones so audible that they were overheard by one of the ladies-in-waiting. The indiscretion ‚Äîthe insult, it was called‚Äîwas perforce reported to the Emperor, and forthwith the young prince was marked by the secret police. 

>He was alleged to have in his possession certain letters addressed to him by the great lady who had been the object of his too-public declaration. They were not perhaps of a seriously compromising nature; but it was enough that they existed. The police endeavoured to recover them. Led by the zealous Zembo, they raided his apartments in the Rue de la Ville L'Eveque. Naturally, Camerata declined to deliver the documents or betray where they were deposited. He was ready to defend the lady's honour with his life. A dispute arose. There was a struggle; and Zembo, his hot Corsican blood being aroused, or his zeal overmastering his prudence, shot Camerata through the head‚Ä¶

After relating these two rumors, Caroline recounts the following as having occurred after his death:

>Next morning, all Paris talked of the suicide of one of the most favoured of courtiers. It was freely said that, not being able to meet his liabilities, he had taken his own life. We who knew him were well aware that he was not a moral coward. Whether he was really in debt at that time or not, I cannot tell; but it is certain that his mother was wealthy.

>The Princess Bacciochi was having a marble bust made of her son, and she requested me to go and see this bust and give her my opinion as to the likeness. I went, then, one day to the studio of the sculptor. There was a beautiful young person there who inspired the chisel of the artist in the work that he was engaged upon when I entered. I learned that she was Eliza Letissier, an actress of the Vari√©t√©s who was known professionally as Mile. Marthe, and who had been entirely devoted to poor Camerata. She could not be consoled for his death. A few days later on, she was found dead in her room. In her hand was a paper, not in her own handwriting, stating that she did not want to live longer without her lover. She had chosen to follow him. And this is how, for lack of a movement of goodness, for lack of a little tender feeling and human pity, one may have to answer for two lives.
