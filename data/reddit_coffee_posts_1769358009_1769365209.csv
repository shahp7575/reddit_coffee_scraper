You know that weird feeling of déjà vu, like you've done or seen something before? Usually, it's just a fleeting, 'huh, weird' moment, right? But this was next level.

I was grabbing coffee with my friend, Sarah, at our usual spot. We were talking about our terrible dating lives (classic), and she was mid-sentence, gesturing with her hand, a little milk foam mustache on her lip. Suddenly, it hit me like a ton of bricks. Not just a feeling, but a full-blown *memory*. I knew exactly what she was going to say next, the way she'd laugh, and even the exact moment the barista would call out, 'Latte for Alex!' It was so vivid, so precise, it felt like I was replaying a perfectly recorded moment from my past.

The air got thick, and for a split second, I felt a strange chill, like a ripple in time. My heart was pounding, not out of fear, but pure, unadulterated confusion and a weird sense of awe. Sarah kept talking, completely oblivious, and sure enough, she said *those exact words*, followed by that specific laugh. Then, right on cue, the barista *actually* called out for Alex's latte. My jaw must have been on the floor.

I just sat there, blinking, trying to process it. It wasn't just a vague familiarity; it was a complete, pre-cognition-level playback. It made me question everything for a moment. Was this a dream I'd forgotten? A brief peek into an alternate timeline? Or just my brain doing some wild, inexplicable acrobatics?

It’s been days, and I still can't shake it. Every time I think about it, I get that goosebumpy feeling again. So, hit me with your stories, Reddit! Have you ever had a déjà vu moment that was so intense, so hyper-specific, that it genuinely freaked you out or made you wonder about the fabric of reality itself? What do you think causes these wild brain glitches?",1,1769365036.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
1qmqqfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/JulianVoss/comments/1qmqqfd/she_echoes/,She Echoes,"I can’t say for certain when it began. In this delirium, time holds little relevance. In the absence of light, day and night pass without distinction. The only sense of progression comes from the scribbled notes that grew like vines across the four walls of my bedroom. They spiral outward in spiderweb designs, miniature script wound so tightly the space between words hardly shows.

They cover my windows, mad attempts to decipher her message written in black marker.

Bethany. My sweet Bethany.

The shadow of her absence covers my world in abysmal darkness.

I awoke one early morning to find her missing from bed. I reached out my hand to feel the warmth left behind in the sheets, sign of a recent departure. *She never rises before I do*. Dread stole over me as I traipsed through the rooms of our house, scrubbing sleep from my eye while calling out her name. “Bethany,” calmly at first, holding panic at bay. But in my heart I could already feel the wrongness of it, intuition’s quiet whisper.

“Bethany!” I shouted, coming into the backyard. It seemed implausible that I should find her there, she never wanted it — *the upkeep, the hassle of it, Henry*. But after finding every room empty and her car still parked in the garage, it was the last place left for her to hide. Boxed in by a tall wooden fence on three sides and the house on the fourth, it was a small patch of lawn tucked away in our little corner of suburbia. Dawn traced each gleaming blade of grass in red, suffused the air with vivid color. It was exceptionally beautiful that morning, I remember that.

But no Bethany.

My eyes tracked from one end to the other, but found only my garden patch, a rectangle of tilled soil ready for seeding, located at the back of the yard. I had a curious thought then, one that’s haunted me since for its selfishness. *If she’s gone, the grief will spoil the gardening*. I dismissed it soon as it arrived, but its stain of shame has not washed off in the time since.

The following week passed in a fugue, only the parts of me concerned with survival maintained daily operation, the rest of me on pause, awaiting Bethany’s return. The usual motions of grief did not set in, held back by the belief I would simply find her one morning lying beside me, as though she never left. I put my faith in this outcome and prepared for none other, keeping her disappearance a secret between the two of us.

Not a difficult task, ours was a life of solitude with few friends to worry over Bethany’s sudden absence. Her disappearance was only mine to fret over and for the first week, I elected not to.

It was not until the first dream that terror seeped into my life, like a gas leak streaming noxious fumes.

They began faintly, cloudy images in the dark, a figure glimpsed in a foggy night. The consideration that it was Bethany did not initially occur to me and most mornings the dream would dissolve too quickly to grasp, only returning as flashes in idle moments throughout the day. Seated on the couch, staring blankly at the television, and then suddenly through its screen, like a veil separating one reality from another, the figure, cloaked in milky white mist, standing at a distance. It came, then was gone, closing the portal before I could ascertain its connection to the dream realm.

*But have these been dreams I’ve suffered these uncounted weeks?*

They progressed. The figure in the distance took on certain attributes, shimmering chestnut curls, narrow shoulders, delicate, pale hands, chiseling at the fog like marble until at last an identity emerged.

*Bethany*. My *Bethany*.

I awoke in sweaty panic, the recognition of my wife in the mist ejecting me from the scene. I couldn’t explain it then, but the dream left an aftertaste of horror, acrid, unshakable. A fear that stole two nights’ sleep as I dosed myself with caffeine to keep from slipping again into that awful place. I wanted Bethany back in the flesh, not this haunting.

Work accumulated unseen, confined to the flat, digital plane of email and internet, all too easily avoided. Instead, I spent those hours pacing, jittery, mind in disarray. In that state, I managed to convince myself I might stave off sleep indefinitely. When I felt my consciousness begin to dip, the racket of my irregular pulse, like driving at speed in a car with four flats, refused slumber.

It was only once I ran out of coffee that I could no longer uphold that farce. I don’t remember falling asleep, it pounced on me in the living room, collapsed me to the floor where it subsumed me under dreams. Or, dream. Just the one. The only dream. A nightmare delivering the worst horror I could imagine, a ghost image of Bethany.

Or so I presumed it to be.

Then she spoke.

I stood in the gossamer thin mist, straining my eyes to pick her frame out of the darkness, when I heard her. Her voice didn’t struggle with the distance, as if transmitted through the fog. I recalled the gentle sensation of her breath when whispering directly into my ear. Little secrets spoken between lovers. Those intimate, conspiratorial asides whose moments reaffirm the matrimonial bond.

Only now it felt cold, bitter, like a quiet argument threatening to erupt. It was a mismatch of tone and content, for the words I heard made little sense to me. “Scratch dirt drown together,” she said. Four words. I would forget them, only to hear her repeat them in subsequent hauntings.

“Where are you?” I replied, disregarding the cryptic message.

Bethany began turning, at which point I realized she’d been facing away, her figure little more than a silhouette in the fog. My heart quickened in anticipation, whether from excitement or fear I didn’t yet know. But it didn’t matter. Before I glimpsed my wife’s face, I returned to waking life, reaching vainly for the dream that eluded me in daylight.

I paid closer attention the next night. In that otherworldly expanse of fog-strewn blackness, I steeled myself. Emotion, I surmised, had thrust me back into reality, each time losing my grip on the dream when I became agitated, excited, scared. If I wanted to receive Bethany’s coded message, I had to submit to the dream that delivered it.

Again, she appeared, pale shoulders bare in a sundress whose bright, floral pattern I remembered, but which now showed faded in the leaden dreamspace. Despite the urge to, I refrained from calling out her name, intent on hearing her message.

“Scratch dirt drown together.”

I repeated them silently to myself so that I would carry them back. Bethany turned, exposing first a pallid cheek, then a dark eye, her feathery brow, the corner of her small, pink mouth—

I awoke, those four words dissipating in the liminal haze. Before I lost them, I snatched a marker from the bedside table and scrawled them across the wall. 

*Scratch…dirt…drown…together*.

Innocuous, meaningless, in all likelihood possessed no deeper meaning than random selections made by my own subconscious. And yet the cool touch of the mist lingered on my fingertips, the memory of my wife’s voice still tickled my ear. It might have been desperation, but I leapt over skepticism into total credulity. Bethany gained access to my dreams through some preternatural conduit and was attempting to alert me to her whereabouts. Or her fate.

A cold chill wormed down my spine. *What might have become of you, Bethany?* As her husband, I would assume the duty of her investigation, press on no matter the grim discoveries that awaited. With our telepathic connection, I held a tool far greater than any detective could employ. Involving law enforcement would only complicate matters, impose unnecessary obstacles. I would go it alone, armed with Bethany’s cipher.

Over the following days, thoughts branched from each word like a murder map, offering potential connections whenever I stood back to observe the whole. Lines criss-crossed the walls of my bedroom, joining seemingly disparate ideas, all grown from the four simple words provided me by the mental projection of my beloved wife. Each night, I hoped for more, but she only repeated, “Scratch dirt drown together,” urgently, sharply, as though I should understand. And every night, she rotated a few degrees more, granting the image of her face in profile, a tease of her celestial beauty.

My notes spilled across the windows, crossing their panes like dark storm clouds blotting out the sun. I amended my handwriting to become more economical with the remaining space. I needed the whole of my investigation within view, to be able to absorb it in its totality. It would not help if I had to run between rooms to draw linkages between thoughts. The knots of this tangled mess could only be undone if I saw the complete picture from a single vantage.

So I rarely left my bedroom, forcing myself to stew in Bethany’s puzzle. Trips to the bathroom or the kitchen were kept brief, made only out of necessity. Life could resume once I solved my wife’s disappearance. I owed that to her.

The spirals began as a creative means to seek more connections. From a single word residing in the center of a spiral, two, three, sometimes four arms would spin outward simultaneously, their separate tracks stacked atop one another in the widening gyre. “Scratch,” for example, would spawn the memory of a rusty nail in our attic that caught Bethany’s shirt sleeve as she passed it, leaving behind a bloody tear in the flesh of her upper arm; while simultaneously recalling discussions about our saving to buy this house, struggling to put together the “scratch” for its down payment. And with these two recollections layered atop one another, I might draw inferences from their comparison, further mentions of the house or the pains homeownership begets — both fiscal and physical.

*The house*. Might that have been her intention? What of the house? In the darkened confines of our bedroom, I meditated on this angle. Our home. It stood empty between its neighbors in an affluent subdivision, the sort of property I once dreamed of, its unused rooms now reminders what life wasn’t. Bethany took convincing, unenthused about its size, its imposing presence. She said big houses were more of a burden than a blessing, that its space would become a curse in time. 

Sooner than she realized.

But I insisted, as it was my family’s money paying for it. 

I laid my hands against the walls in a moment of clarity, gaping at how I’d defaced our home. “What am I doing?” I wondered aloud. The sun passed before the window, slipping needles of light through miniscule gaps between letters. I stumbled back, the pinpricks of sunlight illuminated my inky fingers.

*Bethany is gone*.

I collapsed and wept until the crying exhausted me. Then I slept.

And she returned.

Across the cloudy void, she stood. Bethany, my beautiful wife, turning slowly to deliver her useless message once again. Only now, she completed her turn, revealing the right half of her face, kept hidden during previous visitations.

Shock bolted my feet to the ground, dotted my brow with a cold sweat. The socket that once housed her right eye lay vacant. Or, seemed so at first, until its new resident wriggled forth. The distended body of a well-fed earthworm reached out from Bethany’s eye socket as if in greeting, its length reaching back into the cavity where it disappeared under shadow. The skin surrounding the empty orbit had begun a process of retreat, peeling back to expose the muscle underneath. As a result, Bethany’s right brow inched towards her hairline, registering a sort of grotesquely suggestive expression. The flesh of her right cheek hung loose, colored green by rot. As I looked on, it shivered. Little spasms rippled through the sagging cheek.

Then it burst and a cascade of maggots poured from the hole in her face. When Bethany opened her mouth to speak, all manner of dirt-dwelling insects scurried over her lips, marched across her face, soft, gummy bodies gleaming in a sourceless light. Bethany paid them no attention, her tongue writhing in her open maw as her voice permeated the air, “Scratch dirt drown together.”

“What does it mean?” I cried back to her.

“Scratch dirt drown together.”

She had no other response. Because Bethany wasn’t there, it was only a nightmare simulacrum, the result of paranoia cannibalizing sanity.

Bethany approached, though not by steps. The fluidity of her motion precluded the rise and fall of legs. No, Bethany *floated* towards me, the fog curling away from her in ghostly eddies. And as she neared, I heard a steady dripping echo throughout the darkness. When she halved the distance between us, I saw the horrific origin of the sound. Bethany did not walk because Bethany did not have legs. Where they would have joined her torso to the floor, coils of bleeding viscera dangled and bobbed beneath her. The unraveled small intestine dragged along the floor while her colon pinched and quivered along its tube, as if still shifting waste. At its second turn, where it descended towards the absent rectum, a mole had chewed a window through which to stuff its snout.

I ripped my feet from the floor in a desperate bid to escape, but I could not run fast enough. Bethany, or this horrible apparition that assumed her identity, came over me, draped its entrails across my face until their putrid effusions choked me.

I awoke moments ago and now lie across our bed, the sheets soaked around me. What seemed only a brief time sleeping was long enough to perish the day. A storm rolls in, its pattering rain clinking against the window like a series of tapping fingernails. Lightning flashes, white spears shaft through the window, spangle the floorboards like stars in the night sky, constellations blinking in and out of existence. The bedroom is otherwise dark, fetid. The accumulated stench of days, weeks, months holding myself hostage in this tiny space, toiling with a mystery I’ll never solve.

Bethany is gone. Whether left or taken, the result is the same, and I should have brought this to the authorities that first morning when I reached out to touch her only to feel her fading warmth in the bedsheets.

A sound. Like the groaning creak of a floorboard, but strangely…*wet*. Emanating from the hallway, louder now, as if beckoning. Weak, weary, I rise on shaky legs, shamble out of the bedroom to investigate. I brace myself against the wall, my body feeble from neglect. Leaning into my right leg, I test the floorboards, see if I can’t replicate the curious sound and settle my nerves. But they don’t so much as squeak under my full weight.

A flash of lightning cuts through the dark, illuminates the hallway just long enough to perceive a shape at its far end. Thunder rolls through the heavens, an angry, bellowing god condemning the world. Goosebumps break out across my forearms, the hairs on the back of my neck rise. *Could that have been…?* No, you’ve poisoned your mind, now hallucinations result.

But then I hear the sound again and it’s much more difficult to dismiss. A gurgling moan, reaching out from the darkness before me. I peer into the shadow, begin to trace the outline of a figure. An intruder. Someone’s broken into my home, come to rob me. “Take whatever you like!” I tell them. “It’s yours! All of it, take it and leave!”

A second flare of lightning, more sustained than the first, reveals Bethany in the hallway. Though not all of Bethany, only the half that’s haunted me. Just as she appeared in my dream, she hovers before me, dripping blood from her exposed insides.

I gasp and shrink away from her, grasping at the wall to keep from falling. Only, she doesn’t advance. She only floats in place, fixes me with an unblinking stare. “Scratch dirt drown together.”

Fury wells within me, compels me to scream, “It means nothing! Nothing! Nonsense! Leave me alone, I should never have married you!”

The silver band adorning my left ring finger suddenly burns. I rip it off with ease, finger skinny from malnutrition. I hurl it towards Bethany and it lodges in her empty socket, glimmers there like a metal iris. She turns, drags her innards toward the back door. Fuelled by rage, I chase after her, intent on driving her out of my home, out of my life forever.

She leads me into the backyard where she disappears into the rain. Through its downpour, I see a hole where my garden patch should be. Something tugs me forward and I creep through the pelting rain until I stand over the hole.

Within, I find Bethany's remains, just as they appeared in my dream. Maggots widen the hole in her cheek, a millipede slithers out one nostril before stuffing its round body into the other. Her legs lie apart from the rest. So many stab wounds at her midriff began the work decay has finished. “Bethany,” I whimper, “what happened to you?”

Lightning strikes a nearby antennae. I startle from the resonant crack and slip into the grave, collapsing atop my wife’s corpse. Our faces meet, her one dead eye regards me with contempt. I scramble away from her, but my hands slip in the mess of viscera, releasing a pungent odor of rotten meat. “No, no,” I cry, rising back onto my feet. I reach for the edge, but discover the grave’s deeper than I assumed. If I leap, I might just be able to grasp it—

But the sodden ground crumbles, clods of it strike my face each time I attempt to escape. Lightning flickers every few seconds and with my arms raised overhead, I catch sight of the dirt collected under my nails. Two words echo from the dream. *Scratch dirt*.

I look back at my wife, rotting at the bottom of the open grave. Rain pools and swallows her, rises above my ankles.

*Drown together*.

“*No!*” I start pawing at the dirt, trying to claw my way out of this death trap, but it’s useless. There is no escape. I cannot get out. The water rises, and rises, and rises…",1,1769365034.0,JulianVoss,0,1.0,False

We’re working on a new app called Crwfindr and we’d love your thoughts.

Crwfindr is a social app designed to help people make new connections and friendships through shared interests.

Instead of big, overwhelming meetups, it’s focused on smaller, more personal experiences.. even something as simple as grabbing a coffee with one other person.

Users create and join “experiences” (activities or events), which can be public or private. Private ones are approval-based and include a group chat once you’re in.

We’ve designed two logo options, and now we’re stuck 😅

👉 Which colour feels right for Crwfindr?

👉 Do the colour combinations work well together?

👉 Which one fits the idea of small, friendly, real-world connections better?

And even if you don’t like either of them, or feel they don’t represent the idea we’re going for, please let us know.. any feedback is super helpful.",1,1769365001.0,logodesign,0,1.0,False

1qmqm2z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qmqm2z,Shepherd's Run December Winter Wedding,"I wanted to share some information, as I found the more details past brides shared the easier it was for me, so time to pass it on!

We got married on December 5^(th) 2025 at Shepherd’s Run in South Kingstown RI, and we planned this wedding in about 60 days! That wasn’t the original plan, we had a destination wedding planned for May 2026 but unfortunately my dad’s health took a turn so we decided to change everything. SO, while I wouldn’t recommend it, it is possible to plan a wedding in two months, especially with a venue as hands on as Shepherd's Run!

**Wedding Details**

We invited about 150 guests and had 125 join us for our Friday evening wedding. We worked with Jackie, who I believe is no longer with Blackstone Catering, leading up to booking, and the Rowan for food and everything else after booking, and they both were wonderful. We also worked with Gina from Shepherd’s Run, and a little with Karen the owner of Blackstone.

I took a lot of my inspiration from a wedding posted on Shepherd’s Run website, which the bride had close relations to exquisite so she had a lot of cool décor items.

We did rehearsal at 3pm on Thursday on site at Shepherd’s Run, then the wedding party went to Celeste for dinner, which was wonderful! We did a 3 course pre-fix menu which allowed guests to pick from a few options for each course. They were very efficient, welcoming, and the food was delicious.

We did a welcome party for all guests Thursday evening at 7:30 at Tower Hill Brewery which is like 1 mile from the venue and even less from the hotel. This was again so convenient and very fairly priced! We had the whole place to ourselves!

We did a room block at the Fairfield Inn right across the street, which is so so convenient! A long bus ride really brings down the vibe, so I was glad the accommodations for guests were so close.

We also held a few rooms at Shepherd’s Run as we wanted to have a few of our family and wedding party on site with us. And this includes getting ready rooms.

A key thing to note – **hotel rooms at both Fairfield and Shepherd’s Run were a fraction of the cost compared to summer months! Also, some vendors had ‘off season’ discounts.**

Budget - $130,000 – we were very close to this… but I’m sure I’m forgetting a few things below that would have put us a little over.

Venue - **$18,564 + $1404**

This was for the Event Hall, Wine Hall, On-Site ceremony, Sturgis Study, and 30 minutes of added time to the reception. We had to stay on top of Shepherd’s Run for a few items like room blocks and other questions, they were not as responsive as Blackstone, but Blackstone would help push them a long a little because they were also on site sometimes. The $1404 was for our wine minimum… you need to spend at least $10 per head on Shepherd’s Run wine.  

Catering – **$36,000**

Blackstone was wonderful to work with… definitely do the tasting, it’s an exciting experience! We ended up doing a custom vegetarian dish – cauliflower steak with farro risotto and carrots, it was delicious! This was for premium plated menu, dim sum add on to cocktail hour, cheese and crudite, Standard Open Bar, mini dessert table, and staffing.

Décor – **$23,475** Exquisite and Pranzi $8766

Pranzi – we used them for all our linens and long tables… we really enjoyed our visit with them to pick out table linens, glassware, napkins, chargers, etc, and we fell in love with two table clothes (a velvet green and neutral dark) that Peak did not have, so that’s why we ended up going with Pranzi, although it seems like the venue prefers Peak.

Exquisite – we used them for most of our ‘hanging’ décor… like the pendants above the dance floor, curtains on the back wall and on the room entrances, string lights along ceiling and back wall, hanging structure for ceremony / head table, oh and the dance floor (which i freaking loved). Scott was so wonderful, and brought some great ideas to the table!

Florist – **$17,566**

We used Sayles Livingston Design, her and her team were wonderful to work with. We actually didn’t want the room to look too overdone with flowers, so we did a variety of arrangement sizes, plus a mix of candles. The flowers were beautiful, and I feel like we really got our moneys worth… although I will say they were supposed to put more in ‘to go’ vases so guests could take them, but not nearly as many as I thought were done this way. I will say I love the look of the taper candles but the glass vase they need to be in blocks peoples view so I’m glad I didn’t do as many as originally planned.

DJ - **$3,000**

We used DJ Petro who was actually recommended by Joe Sax… he was literally the best!! He has little to no social media so you won’t be able to see how he does, but trust, he will read the room, mix in songs together, and keep the dance floor going. Our group danced for 2 hours straight, the dancefloor was packed!

Saxophonist - **$1,700**

We used Joe Sax who works very often with DJ Petro so they have a great vibe together. He was a blast! I think we were the first wedding our guests had seen with a saxophonist so everyone was LOVING it.

Photographer - **$6,000**

We used Joseph Laurin Photography with a second photographer and have zero regrets. They were so fun and chill… if you’re looking for a formal, proper, dressed in a suit photographer, Joe is not it. But if you want to have fun, joke around, and get your photos done efficiently, he’s your guy! I felt his moodier, darker style worked well with our winter wedding vibes.

Content Creator - **$2100**

We used The Social FRM and she was great! Blended in with the crowd, worked really well with our photographer… we chose a content creator because we wanted to see pics and videos ASAP, and get sharable files. This worked really well for us, some of my friends had ‘wedding regret’ because they were thinking about what went wrong, but when you see the short clips and pictures right away, you’ll see everyone is having fun!

Transportation - **$2252**

We used Arrow Prestige Limo and Coach, they were easy to work with and experts of the venue. We only did 1 35 passenger coach and it just did a bunch of trips since everything was so close.

Hair and Make Up - **$2630**

We used Alison Barbera Beauty, and as all the reviews state she’s wonderful to work with, excellent communication and coordination. We had 2 hair and 2 make up artists for 10 women and 2 flower girls. The morning flowed perfectly and I think everyone liked how their styling turned out… I did at least! We had Paige, Lauren, Nicole, and Leah.. and I paid for everyone’s hair as part of their bridesmaids gifts.

Welcome Party - **$4000**

We had this at Tower Hill Brewery and they have one set price for events, and it includes beer for the entire time. You can order food from restaurants close by, and they let you bring your own wine! Great to work with!

Rehearsal Dinner – **$2650**

We had this at Celeste, which has a great back room that fit our headcount. We chose the 3 course plated and no bar package, just paid by the drink. It was perfect, and delicious!

After Party - **$950**

We did Audrey’s Coffee House which was again, amazing to work with! And my guests loved meeting Jared from the Bachelor show… lots of fan girl happening. **But I messed this up a little**.. it’s $1200 minimum but I forgot to email him back saying it was open bar instead of cash bar, so once I realized this I told him, which is why the total I paid was less than the minimum, because with everyone paying cash at first, we met the minimum.

 

Small things worth mentioning

\-          I loved these [fur coats](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/jou-jou-juniors-faux-fur-double-breasted-coat-created-for-macys?ID=18307487) for my bridesmaids.. they were fun for pictures, basically the same price a shawl/shrug they would never use again, and of course for keeping warm on our 25 degree day.

\-          We ordered bridesmaids dresses from Azazie… definitely recommend ordering two sizes, and considering that these are not super high quality so if it looks like it is in pictures, it probably isn’t lol

\-          I got my dress from Everthine which was such a cute space, and great team. They were able to rush order it in time, which was very lucky!

\-          I ordered getting ready pajamas for bridesmaids from Banana Republic, they were so cute and fit the moody colors I was going for.

\-          We ordered getting ready food from Belmont market which was not good, at least to me… I actually had a non-bridesmaid friend grab me a large fry and a coke from McDonalds to settle my nerves

\-          We did welcome boxes that were a little over the top but super cute… included his, hers, and our dogs favorite snacks, water, electrolytes and tylenol, a little mistletoe, and a blanket (I’m a big blanket girl)

\-          We ordered napkins with our dogs face on them from etsy.. blackstone for sure forgot to put these out for cocktail hour with a reasoning of ‘they didn’t want to run out’ but now I have 200 napkins at my house

\-          We did printed menus from Minted that I added the tassel to .. loved this touch

\-          I did a set of shelves with various items for our seating chart… this was my one DIY! We printed tables to put in frames, and then I circuit tables onto vases and books, and I freaking love how it turned out. We brought all this décor in ourselves, and I shared an outline and put a stick note on each décor item for where it went, and Rowan executed it perfectly.

\-          I was worried about the mad dash to the bar for cocktail hour and the long line… but Blackstone did a great job handling this. We did ask for Shepherd’s champagne and beer like budlight and high noons to be passed right at the exit which I think curbed the bar line and appealed to most of our guests.

 

Happy to answer any and all questions!

he's cute, and kind. i hate to admit it pero gusto ko siya. Haha! pero at the same time, i'm scared kasi na baka masira friendship namin. idk if may chance, pero our friends would tell me na baka gusto rin ako ni guy kasi napansin nilang mas close siya sa akin kesa sakanila. i could say na we're both comfy to talk about our lives, family, and goals in life -- ganung level of closeness. we're comfy rin to show & share out weird sides to each other hahahaha

sometimes, i wonder din if type niya ba ako kasi he's been very thoughtful pagdating sa akin. example, one time we ate outside w/ our friend group and yung isa sa choices na food is may ingredients na hindi ko kinakain and he said na huwag yun ang orderin kasi hindi nga ako kumakain nun -- in which, i can't even remember na i told him that. he'd do something out of his job description (since magkaiba kasi kami ng job position) just to help me -- there's this one time na meron akong something na need gawin sa work na sobrang hate ko gawin kasi nahihirapan ako pero he did it without me asking na gawin niya! nagulat nalang ako ginagawa niya na pala. i asked my friends if natulungan na din ba sila nung crush ko the way he helped me pero hindi pa raw. Haha! i noticed too na he usually include me if mag-oorder sila ng coffee ng mga friends niya sa work, or baka naaawa lang siya sa akin? mga ilang times niya na ako sinasama sa order niya (and libre niya yun). everytime i tell him na balak ko na magresign, he'd tell me na 'wag muna and he'd give me advice para huwag muna ako umalis lol

1qmqigy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qmqigy,GOOD MORNING VIETNAM!!!!!!!,"For my Snowmaggedon lunch I decided to eat the LRP menu 1 beef hash. As you can see there isn't much to this menu. This seems to be typical of the first LRPs and MREs. This is allegedly from 1977-78. I'm working on getting some information on these. I emailed the Solider Center at Natick and was told that the people that worked on these are all retired and he had a person he could reach out to. Hopefully I'll get some cool info on these since there are no dates on anything. 

Getting back to the ration, the accessory pack actually came with two coffees and both are in perfect condition. Spray dried, with a wonderful coffee aroma. I made the initial cup black so I could taste the coffee on its own and boy howdy that's some of the best coffee I've ever had. Robust and smooth with no hint of bitterness or age. This is the coffee they need to bring back. It was also made by Tenco who was owned by Coca Cola. Definitely a 10/10 for me and I'd drink this black all the time. 

The cocoa beverage powder was in great shape. It had that old library book smell, which I happen to love. It also had that as a background taste. It's not off putting to me. I'm way more worried about rancid milk powder. This still had a rich chocolate flavor with a creamy finish. Too bad they don't have this anymore either. This is also a 10/10. Now to up the game I dumped the other coffee, the reviewed one, the sugar and creamer for my cafe mocha and holy shit this was a 15/10. Also another cool thing is the cocoa and coffee packs have this gold sheen to them. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not but cool nonetheless. 

The only other food item in this ration is the orange cornflake bar. I have loved every cookie and cornflake bar that I've had so far. But I have to say this is my least favorite. I love the bar and I love orange, but maybe not so much in this combo. The bar had a fine, crunchy texture with a Tang flavor. I'm pretty sure it's Tang mixed in. Chocolate powder or just leaving it plain would've been a better choice. Granted this provides Vitamin C so it serves a purpose. This is a 6/10 for me. There are much better flavors of these. 

Now for the star and I do mean the star of the show. This was a freeze dried main made by The Right Away Foods Company of Edinburg Texas. The inside packaging leaves much to be desired. They dumped it in an unsealed plastic bag, folded it up and stuffed it in the foil bag. Basically you always get residue that falls out into the outer package and gets all over the inner bag too. There might have been 1/16 of a teaspoon or less loss. The inner package was a bit oily but seems to be oar for the course for these old LRPs. Again nothing bad. There were no rancid or off putting smells when opened and really no smell at all, which is a very good sign. I decided to keep the outer bag and wiped it out with a damp paper towel and was immediately hit with this rich, beef smell and gals and pals I was salivating. It called for 13ozs of water so I eyeballed it. The smell coming off of this was simply amazing. I let it hydrate while I made the drinks and probably let it go for about 10 minutes. It looks like slop when you pour it out but let me tell you this is far from it. 

The smell is beefy and rich and savory. It has nice chunks of ground beef and chunks of potatoes. I think it also has mashed potato powder in it too. It's very thick with no gravy. The flavor is beefy, rich and savory and needed nothing. Exceptionally seasoned. The last pic shows the aftermath. I damn near licked the plate clean. Simply one of the best and if not the best mains and items I've ever had. 100/10 for me. If just the hash was still available I'd buy it to have around for snacks. 

Overall this is a 10/10 even with the bar. It's a cool and tasty piece of history. I might have to get cans of freeze dried ground beef and potatoes to try and recreate this. The gravy is the key. I will make this from fresh ingredients too just because this is in my wheelhouse for meals.

**A bit about me**

Physically, I’m 5’6” (168 cm), around 67 kg, with brown hair, green eyes, and usually a bit of stubble. 

I'm quite active and outdoorsy. Snowboarding is my biggest passion and I head to the Alps whenever I can in winter; I also train off-season at The Snow Centre. Outside of that, I enjoy the gym, long walks around the city or parks, and go-karting. Most of this is currently on pause as I'm recovering from knee surgery, but I’m aiming to get back to it all.

I also follow Formula 1 closely and usually plan my weekends around race sessions. Watching together or heading to a pub would be great.

I’m also into more chilled stuff like anime and manga, gaming from time to time (especially Call of Duty), board games, cinema trips, and relaxed movie nights. Big fan of Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Marvel.

Music-wise, I listen to a lot of EDM, techno, rock, and metal. I go out to events or gigs fairly regularly and enjoy festivals too. I’ll actually be at Tomorrowland Winter next, which I’m really looking forward to.


**What I’m looking for**

I’m looking to meet someone open-minded, kind, and emotionally aware. I value calm communication and a relaxed, pressure-free dynamic.

I’d love to start with something simple like a coffee or a walk and take it from there at a pace that feels comfortable for both of us.

Most of this is currently on pause as I’m recovering from knee surgery, but I'm aiming to get back to it all.

I also follow Formula 1 closely and usually plan my weekends around race sessions. Watching together or heading to a pub would be great.

I’m also into more chilled stuff like anime and manga, gaming from time to time (especially Call of Duty), board games, cinema trips, and relaxed movie nights. Big fan of Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Marvel.

Music-wise, I listen to a lot of EDM, techno, rock, and metal. I go out to events or gigs fairly regularly and enjoy festivals too. I’ll actually be at Tomorrowland Winter next, which I’m really looking forward to.


**What I’m looking for**

I’m looking to meet open-minded, easygoing people who are also interested in making new friends. Shared interests are great, but I’m just as happy learning about new hobbies or trying something different.

Whether it’s a coffee, a walk, a gym session, a race weekend, a board game night, or heading to a music event, I’m pretty flexible.

**Why This Pick?**

The Clippers have been on a heater, and the Nets are easily one of the worst teams in the league. With LA trending in a great direction and playing at home, this is the type of encounter that they should win by a landslide. The Clippers have won 12 of their last 15 games, while Brooklyn has won just 12 games all season (lol). Lastly, the Nets have lost each of their last 4 outings, and 3 of those 4 losses were by double digits. Take the Clippers to bag a win by at least 9.

1qmqawj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qmqawj,Yunnan Sourcing 2025 Lao Man'e Old Tree ripe puer,"7g/100mL, titanium gaiwan, just off boil

Wash (15s) - aroma of earthy coffee, hints of bread, faint cocoa

Steep 1 (flash) - cough medicine thickness and bitterness, cherry syrup, 100% cacao dark chocolate, mouthwatering and slick, chewy, fills the mouth

Steep 2 (flash) - more bitter cough syrup, bready, earthy, cherry cobbler

Steep 3 (flash) - bitterness starting to level out, some earthy leaf litter joins in, sweetness climbing cheeks a bit in finish 

Steep 4 (5s) - that extra flash steep definitely helped take the edge off a bit, bitterness still firm, but manageable in typical Lao Man'E fashion, very pleasant in the overall presentation on this shou, still thick in the mouth and throwing lots of extra-dark chocolate vibes

At this point my son brought over a Lego set and we just enjoyed the tea and hanging out without making a lot of notes. The steeps went:

10s, 15s, reboil/20s, 30s, 45s, 1m, 1.5m, 2m+

And they stayed full and thick until steeps 11 and 12, which started to thin out a bit but remained full flavor

Overall Impression - This is the type of tea where each steep makes you want to drink more. It has that typical Lao Man'E bitterness where it never goes away, but it has this quality where the bitterness tends to numb you to more bitterness over time. This brews up nice and thick, and could honestly go even thicker if you want to push the bitterness more. Despite being a 2025 ripe, there was zero fishiness, and the earthy forest floor was largely overtaken by extra dark chocolate. This isn't a thermos shou unless you are brave, but this is really nice for gongfu brewing if you like bitter shou.",3,1769364108.0,puer,0,1.0,False
1qmqan4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1qmqan4/the_nonverbal_moves_that_make_you_look_like_the/,The Nonverbal Moves That Make You Look Like The LEADER (even if you're not),"Studied body language research for months because I kept getting passed over for projects at work despite being qualified. Turns out, 93% of how we communicate is nonverbal (UCLA research). Your words matter way less than you think.

Most people blame their ideas or timing when they don't get taken seriously. But honestly? It's usually the way you're standing. The hesitation before speaking. How you hold your coffee cup during meetings. Sounds ridiculous, but these micro-behaviours are literally deciding your career trajectory, and nobody talks about it.

Spent way too much time going through FBI body language analysis, Amy Cuddy's power posing research, and behavioural psychology studies. Also binged Charisma on Command's YouTube breakdowns of Obama, Steve Jobs, etc. Here's what actually works:

The entrance matters more than anything you'll say

Walk into rooms like you already belong there. Not arrogant, just...unhurried. Leaders don't rush. They don't apologise with their body language before speaking. Research from Harvard shows people form impressions in 7 seconds. You're basically cooked before you open your mouth.

When you enter, pause for half a second. Scan the room. This tiny move signals dominance because only confident people can tolerate that micro-moment of attention. Joe Navarro (ex-FBI agent) breaks this down in ""What Everybody's Saying"" and honestly t, his book is insanely good for understanding power dynamics. He spent 25 years reading criminals and now teaches how to spot deception and project authority. The section on territorial displays alone is worth the read. Makes you question everything you thought you knew about ""natural"" leadership.

Claim space without being a dick about it

Stop making yourself smaller. Women especially do this, pulling arms in, crossing legs tight, occupying minimal space. Evolutionary biology says a bigger presence equals a higher status. Spread out slightly. Rest your arm on the chair back. Don't hunch over your phone.

But there's a balance. Sprawling like you own the place when you're new comes off aggressive. The move is ""relaxed expansion"" – you're comfortable, not compensating.

The eye contact thing everyone gets wrong

Too little eye contact reads as weak or dishonest. Too much is psychotic. The sweet spot is holding eye contact for 3-4 seconds, then briefly looking away before reconnecting. This is how dominant primates communicate (yeah, we're basically fancy apes).

When someone else is speaking, maintain steady eye contact. When YOU speak, you can break it occasionally. Sounds backwards b, but it signals you're not seeking approval. Check out Vanessa Van Edwards' YouTube channel ""Science of People"" for breakdowns of exactly how leaders like Oprah and Bezos do this. She ananalysesrame-by-frame body language, and it's weirdly fascinating.

Slow everything down by 20%

Fast movements signal anxiety or lower status. You're rushing because you assume your time is less valuable. Wrong energy.

Slow your walking pace. Slow your hand gestures. Add pauses before responding to questions. This gap where you're just...thinking? Uncomfortable as hell at first, but it reads as thoughtful and self-assured. Barack Obama's entire speaking style is built on strategic pausing. Rewatch any speech and count the silence. It's powerful.

The handshake still matters, unfortunately.

Firm but not crushing. Vertical positioning (don't turn your hand on top or underneath). Maintain eye contact throughout. Two seconds max.

If someone tries the dominance move of grabbing your elbow or shoulder during the shake, step slightly to the right to break it. Don't let people literally steer you.

Posture is giving away everything.

Open chest, shoulders back but relaxed, weight evenly distributed. Basically, imagine a string pulling the crown of your head toward the ceiling.

When sitting, claim the armrests. Don't slump or lean back too far (reads as disengaged). A slight forward lean shows interest without seeming desperate.

The book ""The Definitive Book of Body Language"" by Allan and Barbara Pease is honestly the best breakdown of this stuff. It's like the bible of nonverbal communication with cross-cultural research and evolutionary psychology backing. Over 10 million copies sold. After reading it, you'll never watch a conversation the same way. Fair warning, though, you might become insufferable at parties when you start analysing everyone's gestures.

Master the head tilt situation.

Keeping your head straight signals authority. Tilting exposes your neck (a submissive gesture across literally every culture). Women are socialised to do this during conversation to seem friendly. It's sabotaging you in professional settings.

Only tilt when actively listening one-on-one in casual settings. In meetings or presentations, keep that head level.

Hand gestures need to be controlled.

Wild hand waving reads as nervous energy or overexcitement. Leaders use deliberate, controlled gestures at chest height or lower. Open palms show honesty. Steepling fingers (fingertips touching) signals confidence but can look arrogant if overdone.

Avoid touching your face, hair, or neck. These are self-soothing behaviours that scream discomfort.

Vocal stuff counts as nonverbal somehow.

End sentences with downward inflexion, not upward (upward sounds like you're asking permission). Speak from your diaphragm for a deeper tone. Eliminate filler words (um, like, you know). Replace with brief pauses.

There's an app called Orai that gives real-time feedback on your speech patterns during practice presentations. Tracks filler words, pace, and energy. Kind of annoying how accurate it is. Helped me catch that I was ending every sentence like a question without realizing.

The mirroring technique

Subtly match the other person's body language with a 2-3 second delay. They lean forward, you lean forward. They cross legs, you cross legs. Builds unconscious rapport and trust. FBI negotiators use this constantly. Just don't be obvious about it, or it's creepy.

Claim vertical space

Stand when others sit if context allows. Being physically higher triggers primal status recognition. Teachers, judges, and executives all do this instinctively.

Even subtle height differences matter. If you're short, position yourself on stairs or slight inclines during important conversations. Sounds manipulative, but cmon, tall people have been accidentally doing this forever.
 
The smartphone is destroying your status.

Checking your phone constantly signals you're reactive, not proactive. You're waiting for someone more important to contact you. Leaders check phones deliberately and briefly.

In meetings, phone face down or put away entirely. Even having it visible on the table reduces perceived authority (study from the University of Essex).

If you want to go deeper into the psychology behind all these body language tactics without spending months reading research papers, there's an app called BeFreed that turns books like ""What Every Body Is Saying,"" leadership psychology research, and expert talks into personalised audio content. 

You can customise the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples, and pick voices that actually keep you engaged (the smoky one hits different). What's useful is that you can set specific goals like ""project executive presence as an introvert"", and it builds an adaptive learning plan pulling from communication experts, behavioural psychology studies, and books on influence. Makes it way easier to actually internalise this stuff during commutes instead of just bookmarking articles you'll never reread.

Exit Strong

Don't linger awkwardly or trail off. Make your point, hold eye contact for a beat, then leave decisively. The last impression cements everything before it.

Real talk, adopting these moves feels fake as hell initially. You'll feel like you're performing. That's normal. Your brain associates your old patterns with ""authentic"" even though they're just habits you picked up. These new patterns become natural after 2-3 weeks of consistent practice.

Also worth noting this stuff works because of deeply embedded social and biological wiring. It's not about manipulation, it's about removing the accidental signals that undermine your actual competence. You're not tricking anyone, you're just finally matching your external presence to your internal capability.

The gap between how qualified you are and how qualified you seem is costing you opportunities. These nonverbal adjustments close that gap faster than any other certification or degree ever will.",1,1769364093.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False
1qmqamw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HolidayVisitCroatia/comments/1qmqamw/croatia_carnival_season_where_to_go_and_what_to/,Croatia Carnival Season: where to go and what to expect (January–February),"Croatia isn’t only a summer destination. In winter, many towns flip into **carnival mode**. Locals often call the season **poklade** or **fašnik**, and you’ll also hear **maškare** for masked groups. The vibe ranges from big-city parade energy to older traditions that feel almost ritual.

Carnival dates shift every year because they follow the pre-Lent calendar. As a rule, the season builds through **January**, peaks in **February**, and wraps up right before Lent. If a specific weekend matters, check official programs in **December or early January**.

# At a glance: the best picks

**Best for scale:** Rijeka **Best tradition:** Zvončari bell ringers near Kastav (Kvarner) **Easiest quick trip:** Samobor Fašnik from Zagreb **Best February culture:** Dubrovnik around Saint Blaise Day (February 3) **Most unique story:** Lastovo Poklad (Lastovo Island)

https://preview.redd.it/p32gcgp255cg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6efdca2aed23a8a0bd30e2201dbdadc32a02c69c

# 1) Rijeka Carnival (the headline event)

Rijeka is the biggest carnival destination in Croatia. The city often calls it the **“fifth season.”** Expect weeks of build-up, pop-up events, and a packed atmosphere on peak weekends.

**What usually happens:**

* a season opening in January
* a dedicated children’s parade day
* the main international parade weekend
* smaller neighborhood events in between

**Good base options:**

* stay in central Rijeka for late nights
* choose Opatija for a calmer seaside base
* pick the Kastav area if Zvončari is the top priority

# 2) Zvončari bell ringers (Kastav area, Kvarner)

For a more traditional experience, look for **Zvončari** near **Kastav**, close to Rijeka and Opatija. Groups wear traditional outfits and large bells. They move in lines and create a deep, rhythmic sound. This custom is listed by UNESCO as intangible heritage.

It’s an easy day trip add-on to Rijeka. Bring layers and plan for time outside.

# 3) Kvarner beyond Rijeka: Crikvenica and Opatija

Kvarner is one of the strongest regions for winter events. Rijeka makes a practical base. Then nearby towns add a different rhythm.

**Crikvenica** often feels more family-focused. Expect parades, music, costumes for kids, and a simple seaside walk between events.

**Opatija** stays elegant even in winter. It suits travelers who want comfort, cafés, sea views, and shorter nights out.

# 4) Samobor Fašnik (easy day trip from Zagreb)

**Samobor Fašnik** is one of the simplest carnival plans. Samobor is small, walkable, and known for sweet treats. Its carnival includes satire and symbolic characters. It often ends with a classic effigy ritual.

**Simple day plan:**

* arrive in the morning
* walk the old town
* coffee and pastry
* watch a parade or stage program
* late lunch
* return to Zagreb

# 5) Dubrovnik in February: Saint Blaise Day (February 3)

Dubrovnik feels calmer in winter. February has a strong local tradition around the **Feast of Saint Blaise** (Festa Svetog Vlaha), also listed by UNESCO. It brings ceremonies and processions that give the Old Town a community feel.

For travelers who like culture and quieter streets, this is a great time to visit.

# 6) Lastovo Poklad (the most unique story)

**Lastovo Poklad** is a dramatic island tradition. The season runs from **January 17 to Ash Wednesday**. A procession moves through the village with a donkey carrying a straw effigy. The finale includes a rope descent, fireworks, and burning the effigy in the main square. A safeguarding project for this tradition was selected by UNESCO in 2025.

Winter travel to Lastovo needs planning. Expect limited ferry connections and possible weather disruptions. An overnight stay is the practical approach.

# Quick practical tips

* Dress for wind and standing outside.
* Wear shoes with grip.
* Arrive early for parade spots.
* Keep phones secure in crowds.
* Book accommodation early for peak Rijeka weekends.

Which style sounds best: big parade energy, heritage tradition, an easy day trip, Dubrovnik culture, or the island story on Lastovo?

1qmqac2,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1qmqac2/im_the_insufferable_woman_that_wont_leave/,I’m the insufferable woman that won’t leave.,"Last night, he made me cry so hard I vomited in the parking lot to our apartment. And I’m going to stay anyways.

Call it whatever you want, cus that might be part of what it is. Maybe it’s my self image, maybe it’s finally happening and I’m becoming my mother who chose men over me every time, maybe we suck enough that you’re all better off with us keeping each other company.

He picks fights for no good reason, pretty frequently, and maybe I’m wondering how long it’ll take before he triggers some sort of episode in me. I used to get such bad mood swings, I would become a dead weight after fights from the intensity of my own emotions. I liked laying on the ground, and typically I’d be a heap on the floor. My ex used to drag me into showers and hold me upright because I couldn’t find it in me to \*\*stand.\*\* It was pathetic. 

When he picks these fights I’m left to defend my little corner in our relationship, and sometimes it almost feels good. After my abuse from grown men as a teen, I am watching what happens when de-escalation finally fucking works. It’s also like a weird comfort when I’m right every time I predict the evening in my head based on his mood. I knew, I just knew, he couldn’t help but work himself up last night. I was right.

We were up until 2 in the fucking morning because he tries to talk me into confusion by sometimes saying legitimate nonsense sentences, or saying dramatic or hurtful stuff, and when I don’t take the bait, it takes a while before he starts responding like a regular guy again. He can’t let an issue rest. I take the bait enough that it feels like I’m an idiot anyway so maybe we are two stupid vipers in a pit. Sometimes it’s harming himself, sometimes he throws out that he should just leave (but he doesn’t, he won’t, he’s saying that because he knows he’s hurting me), sometimes he says these one liners that cut through our 6 year relationship so deeply my chest aches and all I can do is laugh in surprise. Like when he name dropped the person who raped me in an argument. If I don’t escalate, he gets confused, and we talk and talk and talk. It’s tedious. I’m tired and sore. My throat hurts. 

He asks me if I’m miserable, and difficulty with emotional permanence is an actual symptom of the issue In diagnosed with. So I half-lie, and tell him no. The love I have for him has never wavered in 6 fucking years, whether I am manic or in excruciating pain or passing out at the wheel of my car from whatever the fuck is wrong with me, I love him. What does waver, often, is the misery. It pops up sometimes when he does shit like pick a fight because I wasn’t mad at him over bluetooth but he kept insisting he had fucked up somehow but I had been literally just sitting quietly staring out the windshield of his car because it was 10pm and bedtime like 9:45pm. Ask anyone, I’m constantly tired and deeply value my sleep. We spent $4k on a bed for a reason. 

When I dated a guy that showed up at my house at 2am when I tried to leave him, a guy that hit me and cheated on me and told me he would end my life if I ever tried to leave, I learned how to live in the 5% of the time being with him felt good. If I can do that, I can live in the 85% of the time this regular fucking guy is good to me. I’m no major catch anyways, obviously. He drives me around, he cleans when I do the most cooking and baking, and he cooks when I do the most cleaning. He gets me my favorite foods when I’m upset, a few times a year I get flowers. We have a shared passion for music, and we love cars (in different ways) and we love the same shows and movies. We love our cat and she’s well cared for. We are, usually, contented and fulfilled. 

I don’t tell anyone irl about the things he does or says anymore, it’s a little humiliating what I let him say to me sometimes. He doesn’t ever name call or yell, but boy he hits below the belt pretty damn good. And I weather it, and I bite back a little but never with any real heart. I hold myself still, because I did used to get truly angry when we were literal kids (15) and I know what that later became. I know I have the capacity to do terrible things if I don’t remain calm or at least fairly still. And I call out of work for the physical pain highly emotional outbursts caused me. And we get over it.

So today I’ll be miserable. I’ll self soothe with tea and a bath and I’ll cry. He will be fumbling over himself nervous as if I’ll explode (which genuinely I do not know where he gets this from because it’s not him being fearful of me yelling or anything it’s just fear of my bad mood?)

But tomorrow when we carpool to our shared job, and stop for coffee on the way, and laugh at other drivers, and do our jobs in our separate buildings, I think it’ll all be fine again. For now. ",2,1769364075.0,confessions,5,1.0,False

I am a 32 year old guy who is on a work trip to Mumbai and I am planning to stay here for a couple of weeks. Sounds simple, doesn't it ? 

But it isn't. I dont intend on spending my evenings alone walking down hotel lobbies or just meaninglessly wandering around the local roads. I need company. Someone to talk to. Someone who can show me around. Someone who could find me a decent place to stay for my next trip. Someone who could host, if they find me decent enough ? 

All this may sound like a dream, or a really unrealistic situation, but I am in my early thirties and most of my friends and colleagues are busy with life, kids and have moved on. And I do feel left behind sometimes. 

For starters, I am decent looking and well mannered. I like reading and spend my evenings mostly reading books or watching sitcoms. Friends and HIMYM are my guilty pleasure, but I also loved Seinfeld, B99 and The Big Bang Theory. I find the tantrums of Sheldon incredibly cute and innocent. 

And if we do become friends, I will be there for you. (The Friends theme song, remember ?) 

I hope we can have conversations over coffee, strolling around or just casually hanging out. What I seek is companionship in a certainly unconventional way.

I was pulling the graveyard shift again—3:17 a.m., Level B-West sub-basement security loop. Same forty-minute circuit I’d walked five nights a week for three years: check the fire doors, scan the card readers, make sure no one had left the service elevators propped open. Routine. Mind-numbing. Safe.

Until it wasn’t.

I rounded the landing on sub-level 4 and stopped. The yellow tint from the emergency strips painted everything the same nauseous shade, but the stairwell ahead looked different tonight. The railings seemed to lean inward just slightly, like the whole staircase was exhaling. The steps descended farther than they should have—more than the seventeen treads I knew connected 4 to 5. I counted anyway. Nineteen. Then twenty-one.

I told myself it was the angle. The light. The double shift catching up.

Then I heard it.

Not footsteps. Not exactly.

A soft, wet scrape—like bare soles peeling off damp linoleum—coming from below. One slow drag. Pause. Another. Getting closer, but never quite landing on a rhythm a human would use. I froze, radio clipped to my belt suddenly feeling useless. Who was I going to call? Facilities was closed. The on-duty supervisor was probably asleep in the break room four floors up. And whatever was making that sound… it wasn’t asking for an escort to the lobby.

I backed up one step. The scrape stopped instantly.  
Dead silence.  
Then—very faintly—a low, wet exhale. Not a sigh. More like someone remembering how lungs are supposed to work.

My flashlight beam trembled as I swept it down the stairs. The light caught the edge of something on the lower landing: a long smear of darker yellow against the already-yellow concrete, glistening like fresh paint that hadn’t quite dried. Except it wasn’t paint. It moved. Just a little. A slow ripple, like something underneath was breathing.

I didn’t wait to see what came next.

I turned and took the stairs two at a time, lungs burning, boots slapping so loud I couldn’t tell if the scraping had started again behind me. The railing felt colder than it should have—almost slick, like it had been sweating. I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. I knew if I did, the stairs would be longer. And whatever had exhaled would be closer.

I hit the fire door on sub-level 3 so hard the panic bar clanged like a gunshot. It opened—thank God it opened—and I stumbled into the carpeted corridor beyond. The normal corridor. Beige walls. Working overhead lights. The faint smell of old coffee from the break room.

I slammed the door shut and leaned against it, chest heaving.

From the other side came one last sound.  
Not scraping this time.  
A single, deliberate knock.  
Polite. Patient.  
Like someone asking to be let back in.

I didn’t open the door.  
I didn’t go back down there for the rest of the shift.

But sometimes, when the building is quiet and I’m alone in the security office, I still hear it—  
that soft, wet drag  
descending  
one extra step at a time  
waiting for me to forget which floor I’m really on.

And I wonder how long the door will keep opening when I need it to.",4,1769363890.0,backrooms,0,1.0,False

I have been using a Bialetti Venus (I think 4 cups, it's about 10cm at the base and 17cm high) for the past 4 years and I love it, even though I am sure I am not using it right (induction stove meaning it often finishes boiling off).

I drink relatively little coffee (3 days in the week, 2 cup per day) and bags of ground coffee, even when kept in airtight boxes lose their freshness (I see a huge difference when pulling a new bag). For this reason i'd like to grind my own beans before each cup.

Been going down the rabbit hole, and given by budget (\~100-150 GBP max, would prefer 50-100), I have narrowed by options to:

* Baratza Encore ESP
* Fellow Opus
* Kingrinder K6
* Kingrinder K2

I am currently thinking that the K2 is actually the best bang for buck here, and about to pull the trigger. I only drink from my Moka pot so don't need the external adjustments of the K6 nor its larger capacity (I think), and this would be much cheaper (and better quality) than the electric grinders. I only make coffee for myself to I think I will get away with the hassle of manual grinding (and if not that's why Id rather spend 50 than 100GBP)

Is there anything that i a red flag about the K2 for my situation?

Some info ...

The pigmented Carbon Black ink was first released by Platinum in May 2001 and is known for having one of the most intense black colors, even today. Platinum Carbon Black Ink is pigmented instead of dye-based. This ink is permanent and is an excellent choice if you're looking for an ink that lasts a long time. Suitable for documents as well as art pieces and anything else you need to last a long time. 

Made using traditional iron gall formulas, Platinum Classic inks have great water resistance and fascinating color-shifting properties. As the ink dries, its iron component oxidizes from clear to dark gray, transforming the ink into a sophisticated off-black color before your eyes. They also come with a nifty reservoir to help you use every ml!

With Endless Alchemy ink, filling your pen is as magical as the act of writing! The bottle is shaped like a potion jar and rounded on the bottom so that it can spin in circles without tipping over. The included cork display base is flat on one side and indented on the other. The flat side lets the bottle spin freely, and the indented side keeps the bottle in the center while still letting it spin.

1qmpvkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRestIsHistory/comments/1qmpvkf/episode_360_fear_city_new_york_in_the_1970s/,Episode 360 | Fear City: New York in the 1970s Misleading NYT Quote,"I was listening to one of the older episodes on New York City in the 70s. In it, Dominic reads an excerpt from a New York Times article that he portrays as the newspaper itself saying the city has essentially become a total disaster. Here’s the transcript:

“I mean, this is the New York Times itself, Tom, talking about its own city in 1974. 

New York City has become a metaphor for what looks like the last days of American civilization. It's run by fools.

Its citizens are at the mercy of its criminals, who often as not are protected by an unholy alliance of civil libertarians and crooked cops. The air is foul. The traffic is impossible.

Services are diminishing and the morale is such that ordering a cup of coffee in a diner can turn into a request for a fat lip. New York City is a mess and it's getting worse all the time.

So great stuff for the New York Tourist Board.”

This was such an amazing and amusing rant by the NYT that I absolutely had to read the entire article for myself. I managed to find the original article:

https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/10/archives/new-yorks-woes-are-good-box-office-film-view-film-view-new-yorks.html?unlocked\_article\_code=1.HFA.sDIL.NNTmZpbHj035&smid=url-share

I was quite disappointed in what I found. This article is NOT the view of the New York Times that the city has become a hell hole, it’s essentially a blend between a movie review and status report on the film business moving out of LA and to NYC and the impact that has on the types of movies being made. What Dominic read was not the opinion of the newspaper, it was a description of recurring themes from recent movies painting NYC in that way. The sentence right before he begins his quote makes this clear, “New York City is a mess, say these films.”

The last line on New York being a mess and getting worse all the time is a view Dom correctly attributes to the article. However, the vast majority of the article is pure analysis of movie themes.

I’m still a huge fan of the show, but I think this bit shows that Dom and Tom are of course capable of making mistakes in fact or judgement. I don’t think this is the worst infraction in the world, but I do think it’s playing a little fast and loose with the sources to generate a more shocking and compelling story. 

We should be double checking things that seem too good to be true. It does raise into question other parts of the show that handle even more complex topics. I’ll continue to listen and enjoy the show, but perhaps with a slightly more skeptical ear.",11,1769363213.0,TheRestIsHistory,5,0.82,False

1qmpt03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1qmpt03/is_my_husband_lazy_or_depressed/,Is my husband lazy or depressed?,"When I met him, he was still living with his parents and his mom was still doing his laundry. He had pretty good hygiene practices when I met him.

When we got married, i knew he wasn't going to change so I took on his laundry. Not only that, I take care of paying all the bills in the house. We both work full time. We split cooking, even though I do cook more, I'm not complaining. He used to not help with the kids but after being verbal about it, he's trying a little more. 

The thing that he's struggling with right now is not washing his face or brush his teeth every morning. This happens on the days he works and on the weekends. I'm not sure if I just started noticing it now or he recently stopped brushing his teeth. The only time he brushes his teeth is when he showers and that's usually every day in the evenings. Sometimes he'll skip a day. 

He smokes, drinks coffee and obviously eats so his breath smells so bad. I brought it up a few times nicely letting him know nicely that I'm concerned and would like him to prioritize his health. He seemed to do it for a few days then fall back to not doing it. 

Now its getting into arguments because his breath would smell so bad and he don't mind leaving the house like that when he has to interact with friends or work. I'm embarrassed. 

I'm trying to figure out if he's just lazy or is he depressed? I obviously want to support him either way but it's really stressing me out. 

I know yall are not professionals but I'd appreciate some input.

To add: he wakes up early every day and always has an agenda of what he wants to get done that day. And its usually what he wants to do, listen to music, watch movies, build something for his mancave.. he's active and doing things he likes, he's just NOT brushing his teeth 🤦‍♀️",1,1769363057.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

1qmppu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1qmppu1/title_is_possibly_marked_by_the_fated/,"Title is possibly ""Marked By The Fated""","Elaine Hayes's life changes forever in 7th grade when she is b!tten by a boy named Dominic. 

He is expelled, and Elaine didn't see him again. 

Now in her senior year of high school, Dominic has transferred to her school, now a young man with an obsession with her. 

Despite his good looks, Elaine rejects his advances. 

However, she is also dealing with trouble at home as her parents' divorce is in progress. 

Little does she know, Dominic is not human, but a werewolf and she is his mate.

I traced the jagged scar on my shoulder, a ritual that had become second nature to me. The sensation of the uneven skin beneath my fingertips brought a strange sense of peace amidst my nerves. Despite being a senior, the first day of school never failed to stir up anxiety within me. Familiarity with the halls didn't erase the fear of losing my way, prompting me to reach my first class half an hour before it began, determined to sidestep any chance of confusion.

My encounter with Ms. Parker this morning was a bit uncomfortable. She was in the midst of her breakfast when I stepped into the room, forcing me to stand awkwardly as she rummaged through her papers for the seating chart, all while trying to chew her food. Once she managed to find it, she gestured towards my designated seat and I took my place silently, not wanting to intrude on her mealtime further. As I awaited the arrival of my classmates, I read a book to pass time. It felt like they all burst into the room simultaneously around five minutes before the bell signaled the start of class.

As my classmates started to head to their seats, I looked through the faces to see if any of my friends were there. Soon I saw Amelia come through the door. Her brown eyes made contact with mine, and she gave me a bright smile. Once she got her seating assignment, she ran over to me.

""I am so glad to see you!"" She said as she embraced me.

""I'm glad to see you too."" I smiled at her.

She sat down in the seat next to me and pulled her curly black hair into a ponytail. ""Where were you all summer?"" She gave me a concerned look. ""Every time I tried to make plans, you were busy.""

My face flushed as I tried to come up with an excuse. I didn't want to tell her the real reason I ghosted everyone during the summer. ""I- I stayed at my cousin's house in Texas all summer so I could help her take care of the kids."" I stammered out.

""I thought it was your sister that lived in Texas?"" Amelia challenged.

""Yes, yes it was my sister. Sorry, I'm just out of it this morning."" I explained.

The tardy bell for the class rang, and everyone got settled into their seats. I was glad that I did not have to continue my conversation with Amelia. She probably would have pressed me for more details that I was not prepared to give. I did not have any evidence of being in Texas, and I realized too late that I would have to keep this lie going until the end of the school year.

""Good morning class, I am..."" Ms. Parker was cut off by a student walking in late. As he walked in I noticed that he looked familiar to me. Though I could only see his back as he received his seating assignment from the teacher, I could swear that the new student's presence shifted something in the air. It was as if a subtle energy had changed, and a strange tingling sensation ran down my spine. As he turned to face the class, our eyes met, and a shiver crept through me.

He had an intense gaze, with icy blue eyes that seemed to pierce right through me. His dark hair fell slightly over his forehead as he scanned the room, his presence commanding attention without him even trying. Suddenly, I felt a wave of unease wash over me. I knew him. His eyes suddenly changed color. It was just for a second, but I didn't miss it. They turned gold, and his gaze never tore from mine.

Amelia nudged me gently, pulling me out of my trance. ""Elaine, are you okay?"" she whispered, concern evident in her voice.

I tore my gaze away from the new student and nodded quickly. ""Yeah, I'm fine."" But I wasn't fine. There was something about him that unsettled me in a way I couldn't understand.

""That's my seat.""

I jumped when I heard his deep voice. He was addressing Amelia, who did not move an inch.

""Find a different seat."" She commanded, giving him her signature death glare that usually convinced people to do what she wanted.

""That is actually his seat."" Ms. Parker interjected. ""Your seat is in the back of the class."" She pointed to a seat that was four rows behind me. Amelia sighed loudly, and dramatically made her way to the back of the class.

I dropped my head into my hands in embarrassment. I really did not want any drama this school year. Especially not even fifteen minutes into my first class. I kept my head down, not wanting to look at the young man sitting next to me. I felt uneasy the entire class. Though I did not actually see him, I could sense him staring at me the entire class. However, that could have just been my anxiety playing tricks on me. I never looked up to actually confirm my suspicions because I was too scared to acknowledge him.

When the bell rang, I quickly packed my bag and rushed out of the classroom. Amelia had to run to catch up to me in the hallway. She grabbed onto my bookbag to stop me in my tracks and pulled me off into a corner that we could talk in.

""Was that who I thought that was?"" Amelia gave me an incredulous look.

I nodded because I was pretty sure she knew what had happened back then.

""That was the freak that bit you in 7th grade!"" She blurted out.

I nodded again, the memory coming back to me. I rubbed once more at the scar on my shoulder, the one he left.

""I can't believe they let him transfer here after what happened! Let alone put him in the same class as you."" Amelia continued, clearly upset by his presence.

I took a deep breath and let myself process the situation. We were only thirteen at the time, and that was five years ago. Maybe he has changed. Though, I never really knew him in the first place. We rarely spoke. He moved to my middle school in 7th grade, and he bit me two weeks into the spring semester. I was talking with my crush at lunch time one day, and that's when he came up to me all of a sudden and bit me in the area between my neck and my shoulder blade. I remember it hurt like he11, and I almost passed out when I saw my own blood rushing down my arm. The only thing I remember after that was being esc0rted to the nurse's office. I never saw him again, until now.

Perhaps he was going through a tough time back then. Boys can be quite childish when they hit puberty, maybe it was just a phase of aggression he needed to outgrow. Even though biting someone is really strange, I didn't want to dwell on it any longer.

""I'm sorry Amelia, but I really need to get to class. You know I hate being late."" I gave her a weak smile before slipping by her.

Chapter 2

Entering my fourth period class was like a breath of fresh air. It felt comforting to be in the same room where I've had film class for the past three years. Settling into my usual spot at an iMac that I'd been using since freshman year, I inserted my flash drive to transfer all the footage I captured over summer break. Spending most of my time at public parks, I managed to capture some breathtaking scenes. Although I wasn't sure how I would use these clips, I was confident that I could incorporate them into a project somehow.

My seat was in a far corner of the class where I could avoid the loud kids that always goofed around instead of working on their projects. I looked up at the door waiting for Amelia to come in. We signed up for this class together, and we planned to complete our video assignments together. When she came in she looked really frustrated, and dramatically threw her bag down on the ground next to me.

""He is a complete je//rk."" She huffed out as she sat down in her seat.

""Who?"" I inquired. I hoped she wasn't talking about who I thought she was talking about.

She gave me a glare that confirmed my suspicions. Sighing, I waited for her to continue with the story.

""He was in my last class, Music Technology. I hate that Mrs. Morse gives us assigned groups. It would be a lot easier if she just lets us choose our own groups, like Mr. Gordon does for this class."" She complained.

""So what did he do?"" I interjected, wanting to get straight to the point. Amelia usually gives really long dramatic retellings of her experiences, and I was too anxious to hear what happened to listen through all of that.

""Well he was placed into my group for the semester."" She gave another loud sigh.

""And?"" I pressed. Her dramatics always annoy me.

""I just want to let you know that I did nothing to provoke him..."" She hesitated.

I was absolutely sure she did something to provoke him. That is just her nature. If she doesn't like someone it is very clear, even if she tries to hide it. The more she is dragging this out, the more I am afraid that it will affect me in some way.

""When we met with our groups he barely said a word. This is supposed to be a team effort, you know?"" She looked at me and I gave a nod of agreement. ""While the rest of us were exchanging contacts and trying to come up with a name for our group, he just played on his phone the whole time. When I called him out on it, he just snatched my phone out of my hand to add himself to the group chat."" She whined.

""Sounds like any other rude teenage boy."" I shrugged.

""But that's not the worst part."" Amelia continued. ""When he handed me my phone back it was left on this screen.""

Amelia showed her phone to me and I saw a picture of me. My shoulder-length fawn colored hair was all poofed out and my hazel eyes reflected the flash of the phone taking my picture. My face was all scrunched up and I looked like I was trying to block the camera from seeing me. Amelia took this picture of me at a sleepover a year ago. Underneath the picture of myself was my name and phone number.

""Why would he want my contact information?"" I wondered. A chill went down my spine when I thought about it. ""What does he want from me..."" I whispered.

""I don't know, but you should definitely be careful."" She said, placing her hand on my arm.

I nodded. Giving her a small smile to reassure her that I would be fine. Grabbing my phone from my bookbag, I checked to see if any new messages had come through. There were none so far. The anxiety of it overwhelmed me, so I decided to completely power off my phone.

Mr. Gordon came up to the front of the class and started his beginning of the year presentation. I zoned out the entire time, absentmindedly picking at the floral bandaid on my finger. My mind was flooded with possible reasons why he might have taken my contact information. Maybe he wanted to apologize for what happened four years ago, but that seemed unlikely. There was also the possibility that he could have just accidentally opened my contact, but Amelia seemed too certain that it was done intentionally. The only possible answer is that he had some ulterior motive for doing so. Which could also mean he had an ulterior motive for biting me in the first place.

I felt Amelia shaking my shoulder and realized that my classmates were leaving. The bell must have rang and I didn't hear it. I look down at my hands and notice that the band aid that was there before was missing and that I must have scratched at the open wound on my finger.

""Elaine, are you seriously alright? This is the second time today you've zoned out like that."" Amelia took my hand and looked at my finger. She sighed and looked up at me with concern.

""Don't worry I have a bandaid."" I say while rummaging through my backpack to find one. When I found it she took it out of my hand and placed it on my finger for me.

""If something is going on you can tell me. You can trust me, you know that."" She insisted.

I nodded and smiled at her. Grabbing her hand, I walked with her to the lunch room.

Chapter 3

For lunch Amelia and I grabbed our trays and ate outside. It was a beautiful day, and the warmth of the sun did wonders to calm me. Amelia told me about her summer. She traveled to Kansas for a month to spend time with her grandparents and spent the rest of the summer working at a nearby coffee shop. She pressed me for more information about my summer, and why I never responded to her texts. I didn't tell her much other than that I wanted a break from people and social media.

My 6th period class was Anatomy and Physiology while Amelia had Statistics. Her classroom was in the same hall as mine so we walked there together. When I got to my classroom, she gave me a goodbye hug and left. On my way in I greeted the teacher and chose to sit at a desk toward the back of the class. The tables were set up in pairs, so I put my bookbag in the seat next to mine hoping no one would choose to sit there. I put my head down on the desk and waited for the bell to ring.

Suddenly I felt a presence beside me and heard my book bag being moved to the ground. When I looked up I saw him standing beside me. Dominic. He was not the little boy he was back in 7th grade anymore. He almost doubled in size. All lean muscle and sharp features. His olive skin glistened with sweat and he wore a black shirt and gray sweatpants.

I immediately looked away and focused on my notebook in front of me. Goosebumps rose on my skin and I could feel my face flush red. I could not deny his attractiveness. Dominic's icy blue eyes bore into me as he took the seat next to mine, his scent filling my nostrils with a mix of pine and rain. The teacher began the lesson, but I could barely concentrate with him so close.

I tried to take notes from the powerpoint, and I stole glances at him when I thought he wouldn't notice. He seemed to exude power and danger. His presence made my heart race with a mix of fear and an unfamiliar longing. Why did he have to come back now, after all these years?

When the bell finally rang, signaling the end of class, Dominic turned to me. ""Elaine,"" his voice was deeper, rougher than I remembered. ""We need to talk.""

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. ""About what?"" My voice came out barely above a whisper.

""About us,"" he replied simply, his gaze unwavering. ""Meet me after school."" And with that, he stood up and left.

I had absolutely no clue what he meant, and I spent all of 7th period thinking about it. What did he mean by ""us""? Was he just referring to the biting incident, or something else? He also never gave me a meeting time or location. Dominic probably planned to text me the details, so my powered off phone would be a great excuse as to why I never showed up. I was thinking about running to my car after this class and leaving before anyone could spot me.

I waited anxiously for class to end with my packed up bag on my shoulders. When I heard the bell I rushed out of the classroom heading towards the closest exit. I probably looked strange sprinting around people in the hallways, but I did not care as long as I left before Dominic realized I had no intention of meeting with him.

Once I exited the school building, I broke out in a full on run into the parking lot. I piled into my old red Silverado, and tried to crank it. The engine started to roll over but it would not start.

""Come on! Not now you stupid thing!"" I cursed as it still refused to start. ""I changed my mind, you are a beautiful truck. Now please start."" I whispered.

The engine finally fired, and I fled the school grounds.  

Chapter 4

I realized what a mistake I had made once I woke up the next day. My phone stayed powered off, so I never knew if he texted me. However, I would still have to see him in 1st period. I knew I couldn't miss school because I didn't want my parent's attention to be on me. So, I wore a baggy black hoodie that I pulled over my head and wore headphones. I blasted death metal in my ears so I couldn't hear anybody.

As I walked in I kept my head down and looked at the floor and headed to my seat. I prayed that Ms. Parker would not make me take my headphones off. I could have made up the excuse that I am autistic and I need them. Well, it wouldn't be a made up excuse because I am autistic. However, I didn't want people to know that. The only person who knows is Amelia, and she swore not to tell a soul. It's not that I was ashamed to be autistic. I just didn't want people to stereotype me based on it. I was already an outsider, and I didn't need nobody judging me more.

Once I got to my desk and dropped my bookbag beside me, I slid into my desk and pulled out my notebook. I started writing to make it look like I was busy. My music blocked out all the noise around me, so I was able to focus on my writing. I decided to write a fantasy story about a werewolf king falling for a fae princess. It was nice to distract myself from my thoughts. The thoughts that cause chaos in my mind.

My fantasy was broken by a squeeze on my arm. Anxiety flooded my body and I was too afraid to look up. My hood was snatched down and I saw the face of my best friend. She started to talk but I couldn't hear a word she said. Realizing this, she pulled off my headphones next. My music was so loud that I was sure that the entire class could hear it.

""Dang girl, you are going to go deaf because of this."" Amelia said.

When I looked around the room, all eyes were on me. I heard a few giggles coming from some girls around me. I didn't look to my right. I didn't want to see if Dominic was there yet. Acknowledging his existence would give him an opening to speak to me.

""What's up with you today?"" Amelia asked. Her eyes raked over my clothing with judgment. ""You look like a wreck.""

""Thanks."" I rolled my eyes.

""Are you going to answer my question?"" Amelia pressed.

""I decided to be emo today."" I shrugged hoping she wouldn't press me further. But of course, she did.

""Did you not sleep last night, you have horrible dark circles under your eyes."" She went on.

I reached up to touch my eyes. They did feel puffy. Since I rushed out of the house, I didn't even look at my face this morning.

""I actually slept too much. Probably thirteen hours. It was a wild night for sure."" I laughed to make her worry less.

""Girl, you sleep like you're dead. I've never seen anyone who sees sleeping as long as possible as a challenge."" She giggled.

""I managed seventeen hours one night over the summer. It took a good amount of melatonin, but it was totally worth it."" I continued.

""Taking melatonin is definitely cheating. It's kind of like those bodybuilders taking steroids to get jacked."" Amelia then came closer to whisper in my ear. ""Probably like the freak sitting next to you.""

Crap. He was there. Hopefully he didn't hear what Amelia said.

The bell rang and Amelia groaned. She begrudgingly walked away and went back to her seat. I pulled my hood back over my head so it would block my side view. Ms. Parker went to the front of the class and informed us that this unit we would be reading Hamlet. Even though I was a big reader, I really didn't want to read Shakespeare. It is so hard to understand, and I usually have to go online to understand what was going on in the story.

Suddenly, Ms. Parker locked eyes with me and she stopped what she was saying.

""I just want to remind you all that the dress code states that you are not allowed to wear hoods or hats on your head. The dress code has been the same since you started freshman year."" She stated.

I sighed and slowly pulled off my hood. My anxiety all of a sudden overwhelmed me. Even though my eyes were locked down at the desk, I was so afraid I would look next to me. The intrusive thoughts flooded my brain. Look. You know you want to. YOUR GONNA LOOK. MOVE YOUR EYES. I covered my face with my hands and tried to control my breathing.

I considered running out of the room, but I didn't want to bring any more attention to myself. So, I tried to dissociate and rubbed the bandaids on my fingers. My daze was broken by the bell and a hand placed on my shoulder.

""Didn't you get my text?"" A deep voice from beside me asked.

Dominic.

""My phone died and I forgot to charge it."" I replied, still staring at my desk.

I could feel his presence beside me. A flood of warmth raked over my body. Instead of feeling anxious, I felt calm. As if my body wanted to trust him. But, my brain remembered the little boy biting me. My brain took over and I was anxious again.

""Can we talk at lunch? We have the same lunch period.""

How did he know that? I whipped my head to the side to look at him. His icy blue eyes locked with mine, and just like yesterday they suddenly glowed gold. I jumped up from my seat and turned away from him. Am I seeing things? Surely I am not going crazy. Am I going crazy?

""I don't have a lunch period."" I mumbled before I left the classroom.

Chapter 5

I considered dropping out and running away. I wished I could live in the forest like a nymph. Life would be so much simpler. No more avoiding my home holed up in the library. No more parents yelling at each other early in the morning. No more hearing the cries of my mother as she vents to me about my father. No more sitting on the couch while my father tells me that my mother is delusional. I could just live amongst the animals and trees for the rest of my life. I wished my fantasies could be reality.

Instead of dropping out, I spent my lunch period in the film classroom researching colleges. I looked for ones as far away from Tennessee as possible. A fresh start would be amazing. I could build a new life somewhere else. I could make new friends, find a job, and maybe find a husband. Suddenly a picture of Dominic flashed in my head and I shivered.

""Arizona, really?"" Amelia remarked, looking over my shoulder.

""It would be cool to see the Grand Canyon."" I shrugged.

Amelia gave me a confused look and took a b!te of her apple.

""Last year you kept saying that you never wanted to leave Tennessee."" She mentioned with her mouth full.

""Over the summer I developed some wanderlust. I thought it would be cool to go to college somewhere I've never been.""

Amelia just rolled her eyes in disbelief and was quiet as she finished her lunch. I felt as if she felt some animosity toward me. We were planning to go to the same college together last year. I guess I should have said something to her before I started to plan to ditch her. I felt bad, but I needed to flee this place.

Suddenly, I heard the door slam shut with a loud bang. All eyes turned to the front of the classroom. Dominic. He found me. He was stalking me. Turns out he was every bit of the psychopath he was as a child. Maybe I really should drop out.

""Elaine."" Dominic commanded me. He looked frustrated, and I had no idea why.

I seriously need to get out of here. I thought of any possible escape routes, but the only door was blocked by Dominic. Crap.

""What is going on?"" Amelia whispered to me.

""I have no clue."" I mumbled back, not taking my eyes off of Dominic.

I am not very good with confrontation, and the thought of being alone with him terrified me. But it seemed as if I had no choice in the situation. I stood up and grabbed my backpack and started heading his way.

""Do you want me to come with you?"" Amelia yelled before I got to the door.

""No."" Dominic and I said at the same time.

I followed him out into the hallway. Dominic walked with pure confidence. His head was held high, and he did not once look back to see if I was actually following him. I could have turned around and bolted at that moment, but my curiosity won over my anxiety.

Even from the back he was hands0me. Today Dominic wore a green cargo jacket over a black shirt and dark blue jeans. I never looked at him enough to notice what he looked like or what he was wearing. Warmth once again flooded my body, and I quickly darted my eyes to the ground. What is wrong with me?

We eventually headed outside, and Dominic kept walking further away from the school towards the woods. There was no way I was going into the woods alone with him.

""What do you want to talk about?"" I snapped in frustration, stopping in my tracks.

Dominic finally turned around and sighed when he looked at me. Then he rubbed a hand through his hair.

""I don't want to talk where everyone else can hear us."" He said in a low voice.

""I'm not going to follow you alone into the woods."" I stated, crossing my arms to try to look confident.

""Elaine."" He said my name gently, taking a step closer. ""I am not going to hurt you.""

""You really expect me to believe that after you stalked me to get my phone number and to figure out my schedule. Not to mention that you bit me in 7th grade."" I huffed.

""I only did those things because you were clearly trying to avoid me.""

""Well maybe you should have just taken the hint and left me alone."" I protested.

Dominic suddenly stepped forward and grabbed my hand. It was like time stopped. I felt electricity shoot from my hand into the rest of my body, and I stood frozen in shock.

""Please."" He pleaded, his icy blue eyes digging into my soul.

I followed him into the forest.

Work stuff, docs, random articles, flights, tools… and then I lose the one tab I actually needed =)

So I built a Chrome extension that replaces the New Tab page with a simple dashboard that automatically groups all your currently open tabs by website/domain.

It’s basically the view I always wished Chrome had.

What it does:

1. Groups open tabs by domain automatically (Google / GitHub / Notion / etc.)
2. Shows favicons + color-coded groups so it’s easy to scan
3. Jump to any tab instantly
4. Close a tab or a whole group in one click
5. Pin your “always-open” domains/groups
6. Search tabs by title / URL / domain
7. Light/dark mode
8. Remove duplicate tabs (I somehow always open the same page 3 times…)

And lovely cat that wake up when you open 50+ tabs. And Easter egg - it fails when you close group of tabs under the cat. Then it says some funny phrases.

1qmpng4,https://www.reddit.com/r/piscesastrology/comments/1qmpng4/its_happening_right_now_liberation_day_is_here/,♓️ It's Happening Right Now: Liberation Day Is Here,"Pisces fam, it's midnight. January 26th just started! Neptune is leaving Pisces **right now** as I'm typing this with shaky hands.

I've been staring at my screen for like twenty minutes, not knowing how to start this post because honestly? I'm a mess. In a good way. In a ""holy sht **we** **actually made it**"" way.

**Today, January 26th, Neptune enters Aries and doesn't come back to Pisces for 165 years**. We'll all be dead. Our kids will be dead. **This is it.** The last time in our lifetime.

Since April 2011, Neptune has been **dissolving us**. And I mean that literally. Our boundaries, our sense of self, our ability to know where we end, and where other people begin. For **fifteen years,** we've been walking around like open wounds, absorbing everyone's pain, crying at random Tuesday afternoons for no reason we could explain, loving people who couldn't love us back, and genuinely wondering if maybe we're just fundamentally broken.

SPOILER: **We're not broken**. We were just living through Neptune in Pisces, which sounds pretty in astrology books but feels like **drowning** in real life.

# ✅ What This Transit Actually Did to Us

Okay so. **Losing yourself completely** in relationships. Like you wake up one day and can't remember what you liked before you met them. Giving 100% to people who give you 10% back and convincing yourself that's normal. **Feeling other people's emotions** so intensely you genuinely can't tell if you're sad or they're sad. Making a decision, then doubting it, then changing your mind, then doubting that, then just **freezing**. Dreams so vivid and weird you wake up **more tired** than when you went to sleep. Random crying in the shower. Feeling like you're underwater even when you're just sitting on your couch. **Knowing something's wrong** but the answer is just out of reach, always.

If any of that hit you in the chest, **you're not alone**. That's what Neptune in Pisces feels like when you ARE Pisces. It's been teaching us empathy through literal suffering. Compassion by making us feel everything. Surrender by completely destroying our ego.​

And as of today, **it stops**.

# ✅ What Actually Happens Now

Look, I'm not gonna bullsht you and say you'll wake up tomorrow morning feeling brand new. Neptune takes a minute to fully clear out, maybe a few weeks, maybe into February. But **you'll notice things**. Small things at first.​

Like you'll make a decision and just **stick with it**. You'll feel upset and realize it's actually YOUR upset, not something you absorbed from your mom or your partner or that coworker who overshares. You'll say no to something and **not spiral into guilt** for three days. You'll set a boundary, and **it'll actually hold**.

You'll look in the mirror and go, *""Oh.* ***There I am***\*.""\* Not the exhausted ghost version. The **actual you** who's been buried under fifteen years of everyone else's emotions.

# ✅ Okay, But Will I FEEL Different Though?

**Yeah.** But it's not gonna be dramatic. It's gonna be quiet. Like suddenly being able to **breathe through both nostrils** after having a cold for so long, you forgot what that felt like.​

You won't feel guilty for saying no. Your dreams won't feel impossible. You'll want something and not immediately talk yourself out of **deserving it**.

Some of you reading this at midnight will feel it by morning. Some won't feel it until February. **Both are completely fine.** The transit's ending regardless.

# ✅ What I'm Telling You to Do Today (Keep It Simple)

Don't overcomplicate this. You don't need a three-hour ritual with 17 crystals and a full-moon bath.

Just wake up whenever you wake up. Take a long shower and imagine all the heavy shit from 2011-2026 **washing down the drain**. Open your windows even if it's cold. Let some fresh air in, like symbolically and literally. Drink a full glass of water slowly.

Write this somewhere: **""The fog is lifting. I'm ready.""**

If you wanna do more, make two lists on your phone. ""What I'm Done Carrying"" and ""What I'm Taking Back."" Don't think too hard. Just let it pour out. Then **delete the first list**. Screenshot the second one and look at it when you doubt yourself.

That's it. **Presence matters more than performance.**

# ✅ The Part That's Making Me Emotional

Here's what's weird. Neptune leaving is freedom, yeah. But it's also **grief**. Like we're saying goodbye to the version of ourselves that **survived** all of that. The version that stayed kind when the world was cruel. The version that kept loving even when it only brought pain. The version that **didn't give up,** even though giving up would've been so much easier.

That version of you is a **goddamn warrior** and deserves to be honored today. Say thank you to them. Really mean it. And then let them rest. **You don't have to be them anymore.**

# ✅ What I'm Personally Doing When I Wake Up

I'm gonna wake up early, make my coffee, sit by the window, and probably cry. Because I've been waiting for January 26th, 2026, since like 2013, and there were years I genuinely **didn't think I'd make it here**. But here we are.

Then I'm writing down **three specific things** I want. Not vague *""I want to be happy""* stuff but actual concrete things. And I'm picking one and doing the **smallest possible step** toward it today.

Because that's how we honor this ending. Not by trying to fix everything at once, but by doing **one clear thing** we couldn't do while we were drowning.

# ✅ To Everyone Reading This Right Now

**I see you.** The ones scrolling at midnight because you can't sleep, you're too nervous, too hopeful, too scared it won't actually change anything. The ones who lost relationships, jobs, **entire versions of themselves** trying to survive Neptune in Pisces. The ones who were called ""too sensitive"" when really you were just carrying weight nobody else could see.

You made it through something that was designed to dissolve you. Today you get to remember what **solid ground** feels like.

The fifteen-year fog ends **today**. The version of us that knows how to breathe again is gonna be **fcking unstoppable!!**

We made it, Pisces fam. Through it all, somehow, **we made it**.

And now, welcome back to yourself, dear Pisces. 💙 ♓️

💌 What's the **ONE thing** you're doing on Liberation Day to honor this shift? Even though I may not be able to reply to all, I'm reading EVERY single comment. Let's see how many Pisces are still standing after fifteen years of Neptune's fog. I bet it's more than you think! 💫

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***P.S.*** *If you're scared nothing will change, if you're worried you'll still feel broken, if you think maybe you exaggerated how hard these fifteen years were or that you're somehow the exception who won't feel relief, STOP! You didn't make up the pain, the confusion, the drowning feeling while everyone else seemed fine. This transit ends* ***for all of us***\*, no Pisces left behind. This is real, and\* ***I'm right here with you.***

That night, halfway through the film he asks “Can we turn it off? E.T. SUCKS.”

So I asked him “what sucks about it?” and he replied “E.T. walks too slow. He sucks.”

Then I compare those projections against DraftKings and FanDuel DFS salaries to create a value score, which helps determine who’s overpriced vs underpriced.

These typically lean toward chalk / higher-owned plays, so they’re great for double-ups and safer builds, but use them however they fit your strategy.

I run an optimizer to identify the strongest three builds. The players appearing most frequently are:

* Kenneth Walker — 3

I am also not particularly interested in seeking out people who have their own little niche worlds, to demean for my personal enjoyment. 

But BUT my own little guilty pleasure is seeing, contained within these home-project Victorian gothic libraries with their deep green paint that doesn’t match anything (especially not the popcorn white ceilings of their 5-over-1 condo), their anachronistic furniture (a MCM coffee table, Victorian desk, and particle board ikea bookshelf), and their macabre trinkets (aliexpress pens with AI floral patterns, a bust of Beethoven, and a random magnifying glass with a token skull somewhere). 

The thing that really makes this all so funny as an outside spectator, is that right there in the title is the “academia” component of this whole exercise. Just about every bookshelf in every one of these pictures is ~95% filled with some combination of the Wheel of Time, Mistborn, Game of Thrones, Hunger Games, Harry Potter, et. al. At best you will get scattered collections of those classic reprints with their silly faux-gilt designs. Usually just wuthering heights and pride and prejudice. The allure of existing in a world of dark academia somehow never motivated them to get through community college or pick up some hobby that comes close to interacting with meaningful scholarship. Even being an autodidactic lover of antiquity, history, theology or whatever could seemingly tie into this style; but no, it’s truly an aesthetic dominated by YA lovers.

*Ok, we’re now in full romcom era, entering jealous Haiming era, and I’m all for it. Considering how petty he is, Episodes 9 and 10 are going to be lit.*

*Quick thoughts on Haiming’s hairstyle. When he’s sporting his messy curls, we get a more carefree, optimistic, fresh faced Haiming. When his hair is slicked back in the corporate world, it’s like he’s wearing his CEO mask. I like both, but I do have a soft spot for the messy curls.*

[YUM, that hair, that trapezius muscle. Who needs a plot? He's the main plot.](https://preview.redd.it/xyplpa8q3jfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3962efb0a9a823202cdf77a5cb1def768d1674)

# Episode 9: Pū Líng Pū Líng Eyes and the Chaos Kiss

Incoming drunk trope, and it is spot on. Haiming and Huan’er are still talking around the bonfire, and of course she is scheming her way closer to him. She straight up confesses that she finds him handsome, with pū líng pū líng eyes. Embarrassed Haiming is even more appealing than domineering CEO Haiming. CXX is really hitting a sweet spot here with that helpless gentleman act. Huan’er is sneaking into his heart with lines like, “Do I really have no charm in your eyes at all?”

[I ask myself that very same question every single minute of this show](https://preview.redd.it/r9ci671h2jfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9b4fa7d80f97a19c294824f7b60b8515cf92f60)

I died laughing when he said, “I’ll accuse you of harassment,” after she pretends to fall asleep on him and forces him to carry her back to the room.

I really thought they would flip the drunk trope with Haiming being the drunk one and pouring his heart out, but nope. We get fake drunk Huan’er and fresh faced Haiming instead.

The room is tiny, with one bed of course. Haiming wants to sleep in the car, but Huan’er acts pitiful and gets him to stay. He is not buying the drunk act, but he is definitely softening towards her. 

[Like all of us?](https://preview.redd.it/y5zyk6bn2jfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=33a93c5c6f8f730e0e236b4c04815aed6aae8cca)

He even sets up a pseudo Great Wall of China between them, and he is so jumpy and restless. I burst out laughing when he got skittish just because she touched his shoulder to check if he was warm enough.

[Pull down that pillow wall!!](https://preview.redd.it/o9rdij2l2jfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f47fcec114aeb7e4fc7129205218555a94bc86f)

He cannot sleep and ends up drafting a contract with Dr Wei in the middle of the night. CEO brain never rests.

Next morning, we get the reveal that Dr Wei was the sister all along, just like some of us had that niggling feeling about. They showed her first when the receptionist said Dr Wei was arriving. Plus, it makes perfect sense why Chuantu Institute would not give her a chance, because she’s a woman, and it also aligns perfectly with Haiming’s whole vision.

Haiming and Huan’er successfully sign Dr Wei to work in R&D, and Huan’er immediately starts leading the marketing discussion about redesigning more comfortable sanitary pads. *I mean, I am all for 1999 women getting to enjoy how much more comfortable pads have become in the last few years, and menstrual panties are the greatest invention since sliced bread*. *But why is she doing pad design when she is supposed to be his PR person? Huan’er is becoming the go to person in Letao, she is everywhere.* 😭

[Huan'er, soon to be Sanitary Pad Queen ](https://preview.redd.it/a6h9w6ky4jfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f4a4262344c1d477ff1e723eb3bab732839af4a)

Looks like she got too comfortable, because the System throws her a random quest. She has to kiss Haiming in the next five minutes or get punished. She tries to pull him somewhere secluded, but it is not happening, so she kisses him in front of everyone. Instant uproar. Haiming is shocked, but he does not exactly push her away either.

[She played the System!](https://preview.redd.it/x4qx8ojs4jfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9620c599628c6a56dc9f1c2f238503aeae7056c)

Then Huan’er goes full chaos mode and blurts out that she transmigrated into a novel and that they are all NPCs. System reboot. Mission accomplished. Huan’er played the System, and the System is clearly not happy about it.

For some reason, Haiming takes her to the model studio and shares more about his hobby. He assumes she will find it boring, but she counters by saying people with hobbies like this have richer inner worlds, which is exactly his case. They chat about his collection and Huan’er thinks he wants to complete it, but he surprises her and says he used to think that too. Now he believes, “*Imperfection leaves room for anticipation*.”

He even invites her into his innermost sanctuary and asks her to paint his latest assembled jet. That is one big show of trust for someone as closed off as Haiming.

He also seems confused, like he is forgetting something. *The kiss, obviously. Which is funny because it feels like he is not as impervious to deleted events as he should be. Are the different worlds bleeding into each other?*

Huan’er paints a bright rainbow fighter jet, they talk about parallel worlds, and she tells him she wants to leave a mark with the new millennium arriving soon. They share a close moment when she wipes paint off his chin and Haiming is visibly flustered. The System announces that fondness has jumped to 59%.

[I'd wipe his chin all day, every day too](https://preview.redd.it/bm6u91n35jfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5429c471f4e0a870e6e87097fae664d3fe69086)

Huan’er leaves and meets Mengmeng, completely giddy. She claims it is because she is close to her goal, *but sure girl, keep telling yourself that*. Mengmeng shares some struggles about being a female manhua author, and Huan’er comforts her, saying things will get better. When asked about her dream, Huan’er stops in her tracks and decides it is pointless to share since she is going to leave this world anyway.

*Have you noticed Huan’er never mentions her 2025 life beyond daily things like internet access and coffee culture? She never talks about family or friends. She never shows longing for anything she might be missing. That feels off, right?*

Right then, the pager beeps and the screen goes static, like something is glitching.

Meanwhile, Luo digs up more intel about Huan’er’s past, including her dating history with Ou Xiaojue and misterwhateverhisname, and Haiming’s face turns ominous.

The next day Huan’er arrives at Letao dressed to kill. Haiming invites her for a chat and bluntly asks why she is working so hard to help him. His face looks thunderous, so Huan’er is immediately wondering what she did wrong. She tells him she is helping because he is a friend, and that only makes things worse. He freezes her out and tells her she should dress more appropriately for work.

*Hello jealous Haiming.* 😭

Back at Yunsheng, Huan’er is baffled by his behaviour and discusses it with her female boss and a colleague. They agree she looks great, but it reads more like a date outfit than a work outfit, even if Huan’er believes it works for both. I guess in 1999, dressing like that automatically means you have a date later. She thinks Haiming just wants to be friends, but oh boy, she is going in the wrong direction. *I honestly thought a crafty girl like Huan’er would be more boy savvy.*

# Episode 10: Jealous CEO Surveillance Mode Activated

Haiming is driving around, but every radio programme feels like it is mocking his situationship with Huan’er. So naturally, he goes to the shooting range to let off steam. He also shows up to get Hu Tiehan out of a sticky situation, and my god, what an entrance. *Gone is cute embarrassed Haiming. We have lethal Haiming. Smoking hot.*

[Oh hello you!](https://preview.redd.it/ztbsrn473jfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f04f2d4c1dd7bc629c084fc4b4575d852cff954)

[Haiming, a man of focus, determination and sheer will](https://preview.redd.it/mh6ajq293jfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=32c59176da764e167248b9470a58dc6cbe0151ce)

Tiehan and Haiming talk, and Haiming asks him if he would still try with someone when the story seems impossible. Tiehan reflects on his own situation with Mengmeng and basically tells him that Haiming already has everything, so what more could he possibly want?

Tiehan has a flashback to when misterwhateverhisname (*like Huan'er I can't be bothered to remeber his name*) left for England and entrusted Huan’er to Mengmeng and Tiehan, specifically asking them to stop anyone from stealing Huan’er while he is gone. *Yeah, she's just a thing in his eyes and not a person. We also get doormat Huan’er in all her glory, and raise your hand if you want to shake some sense into her.*

*Now, as host, I’m ashamed to admit I did not even remember they were all friends. Was this mentioned earlier in the show? Tiehan’s first appearances were so fleeting I did not even connect the dots.* But clearly, that chat with Haiming lights a fire under him, because he calls Mengmeng and asks her out on a date.

Haiming then gets a text from Huan’er offering her help 24/7 as a friend, and somehow that makes him even more upset. He barges into Yunsheng the next day and drags Huan’er back to Letao. He offers an extra 3% commission to get her to work there. *I was dying at her boss’s reaction. He would have personally delivered Huan’er to Letao if Haiming had not already dragged her out himself.*

Tiehan asks Mengmeng about Huan’er and misterwhateverhisname, because he suspects Haiming might be falling for her and wants to know what the deal is. *I am also wondering if Haiming even knows Tiehan knows Huan’er, because it really does not feel like it.*

Meanwhile, Huan’er settles at her new desk, of course right in front of Haiming’s office. She meets colleagues with names like Jia, Bing, and Yi, which is really just A, B, and C, and she cracks up about NPC names. Luo dumps a whole box of tasks on her while Haiming spies from his office and pretends to be on the phone.

By late evening, he is still watching her and gets Luo to deliver dinner, but also adds extra work. He is swamping her on purpose so she cannot possibly go on a date with her “boyfriend”.

They “bump” into each other at the elevator, and while they wait, Huan’er gets a text from Mengmeng. Haiming is hilariously trying to see who is texting her, *and honestly, with screens that tiny back then, he would have needed his nose pressed against it to read anything. 😭*

We also get Mengmeng’s flashback about how Tiehan always had her back in university, which is why she likes him so much. *But girl, your heart is in the right place, I still do not get why you are pushing Huan’er so hard to stay with misterwhateverhisname. It is obvious Huan’er is being taken advantage of.*

Huan’er starts suspecting Haiming is jealous, but does she even realise he knows misterwhateverhisname exists? She borrows a hydrating mist from the UK from Mengmeng and makes a whole performance of it the next day right in front of Haiming to test her jealousy hypothesis.

And of course, a brand new carton of hydrating mist gets delivered to Huan’er, and Mengmeng’s bottle gets snatched in the same move. Of course.

That same night, Haiming tells her she is replacing Luo as his PA and she needs to be outside his house at 7am the next morning. Tyrant boss, anyone?

She offers to fix his tie, horrendous print by the way, and does an intricate Eldredge knot. He is impressed until she says she learned it for a man. He pouts, thinking it is for the “boyfriend”, and flounces away while she stares after him in confusion, because he is the one she learned it for. Who else? But then again, Huan’er, Huan’er, he does not know that!!

https://preview.redd.it/wxqx8nv34jfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=2800f2b537217a3bebe0e28a43a2fb9ca352aa73

*Are we entering the misunderstanding era now that we are in full romcom territory?*

The colleagues start grilling Luo for intel because everyone thinks something is going on between the boss and freshly arrived Huan’er. Poor Luo is taking all the collateral damage while Haiming marinates in his jealousy.

Then Huan’er gets an email from misterwhateverhisname at work and laughs at the corny pictures he sent, right as Haiming arrives silently like a cat and watches her. He is not happy, and immediately tells her they need to go somewhere.

[Jealous Haiming is beautiful](https://preview.redd.it/vnb83aj84jfg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=604e6d571b7b7f4b878525bd077c8344809e4fb7)

Cue Tiehan and Mengmeng’s date. She takes him to an expensive restaurant, judging by his reaction to the prices, *because I have no idea if 88 yuan is expensive or not, especially in 1999*. He tries to talk to her and of course they bump into Huan’er and Haiming.

Cat’s out of the bag.

1qmpbjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/1qmpbjt/a_dog_in_a_no_dog_building/,A dog in a no dog building,"I have lived in this apartment for 1.5 years. This building has a no-dog policy — cats only.

And for a reason: the walls are extremely thin, and the building is very small. It consists of studios only and has just three floors.

For the record, I can hear my neighbor next door walking and even hear their door creaking — that’s how thin the walls are.

Yesterday, I woke up very early because of a dog barking. At first, I thought I was dreaming, but the barking became louder and more intense, and I realized it was an actual dog barking inside my building.

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.

I went outside to figure out which apartment it was coming from. It was the apartment below me — I could hear it clearly from the stairs. The dog was barking nonstop and pounding on the door. The noise was unbearable and extremely loud.

The dog barked nonstop for four hours.

I work from home, and this is absolutely unacceptable. I specifically chose a building with a no-dog policy for this exact reason.

I contacted the super and sent him audio and video recordings to show how bad the situation is. He only asked me which apartment it was. Management has not replied at all.

I had no choice but to leave the building and work from a coffee shop.

This morning, I heard the dog barking again, but it stopped quickly. I realized the tenant must have taken the dog outside, so I went to talk to her.

She said, quote: “I am allowed to have a dog here.”

I was shocked. This is a no-dog building, so she most likely obtained some kind of “emotional support animal” paperwork.

But honestly — this is not appropriate in a building with such thin walls.

She told me she is “working on training the dog,” but excuse me — am I supposed to wait until the dog learns how not to bark? That is unacceptable.

I absolutely cannot work under these conditions. I rented this apartment specifically because of the no-dog policy, and this tenant has lived here for less time than I have.

There has to be a solution.

In NYC, it is extremely hard to find good tenants who pay on time. I always pay my rent on the first day of the month — every month.

And this is how management and the landlord are handling the situation?

I've noticed that although China makes a lot of tea, most of it its consumed by their nobles, but in both runs I've noticed that the Chéngdū market has a huge surplus, and its basically the only one, rest are unprofitable or marginal.

Steps in my run:

First month noncb vassalized the Ottomans. First parliament used it to vassal the Pope+ scutage (huge income thanks to the tithe).

Feed the Turks til Alexandria while I ate France (small vassal anexing instead of PU). Formed a dominion in Alexandria. Started spamming map stealings.

Subjugated Yemen into a march (country has +10% raw materials and +33% coffee buff) and feed them coffee RGOs nearby.

Used Yemen (march) to form regiments in Asia in order to conquer India, conquered/used Sailand to make them suicide troops and made 2 dominions+scutage at there.

Heir snipped the Portugal and Spain PU until I got it, I let them America while I colonized Africa for gold RGOs, future cocoa plantations and rushed into Indionesia, for spices (cloves in Ternate and cocoa+chilli in Brunei and Philipines).

Started conquering imploded China from the coast using Taiwan to bait them, making them suicide troops until I could peace out allies, have made 4 dominions at there, **but its not worth it**. As in one of the images I think the most efficient/fastest way making your way from India to west China reaching the Chéngdū market ASAP thru land, rest of China is not vital for a fast economy run.

Annexed Portugal thus inheriting Brazil colony. Starting now to consolidate my locations around Chéngdū to get more trade capacity.

Advices: don't overextend with Colonial subjects since they will seek freedom at age VI, dominions are OP (25% strength vs overlord) you can easily make these instead in high populated zones without any issues even if they get disloyal. Once and just before Ottomans are getting disloyal make them divert trade + scutage and forget about them, you only need their money from there on. Get as much money and core lands you can so you can have 1,5B troops as I have rn so dominions stay loyal. Always divert trade ASAP before you realize you lost a subject group loyalty. Foreign trade buildings OP. Use a low pop market you own between your capitals market and Chéngdū market if you can't reach it directly (so pops there would consume only a marginal number of tea), you only need Chéngdū trade capacity to export and your capitals trade capacity to import from it.",5,1769361992.0,EU5,0,1.0,False

1qmparz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qmparz/just_so_you_know_if_they_are_young_want_to_go_out/,"Just so you know, if they are young want to go out and explore while you were his first and a good girlfriend, they will come crawling back.","He was my first serious boyfriend (22M), and I was his first. I’m slightly older (25F), but we were at a similar life stage because I spent most of my life studying (master’s, PhD), while he was in his fourth year of university (he took two gap years, so he’s older than most college students). I’m an international student; he’s local.

This matters because even though we both come from wealthy families, he was less spoiled and had to work for his pocket money, while I received financial support from my dad and have my own trust fund. So although everything else aligned, our “money principles” were a little different.

We were very much each other’s type. It was first-love, puppy-love kind of energy—super surreal. I never thought it would end. For almost a year, we were deeply in love: shared the same values, played the same games, had the same humor and political views, and incredible sex. We were addicted to each other. It was truly a magical year for both of us.

Then the differences in maturity started to creep in. While we were both introverts, I had already experienced a lot of socializing and partying (I don’t drink or do drugs, but I’ve been around people who do, and I’ve seen the good and bad in people). My boyfriend, on the other hand, was more of an athlete but heavily a gamer. He would play sports for fun, then come home and game for hours. He didn’t really socialize and didn’t have any close friends—only “good friends” from high school whom he gamed with. He often mentioned that people “didn’t seem to like him,” though he didn’t know why and just accepted it.

He had some strange logic—things that, if said in front of a group, would probably get him called out or labeled as flat-out weird. Over time, his selfishness started to show. I think he hid it well during the honeymoon phase, but once he got comfortable, everything came out.

For example, I liked treating him to groceries, cooking for him, taking him to fine-dining restaurants because I loved him and wanted him to experience more of the world and Asian culture. I bought him nice bouquets for Valentine’s Day and made handmade gifts so he would feel appreciated.

One day, it completely caught me off guard when I realized he was keeping track of how I hadn’t paid him back four dollars for coffee. That day, I just wanted to feel like a damsel in distress—I told him I forgot my wallet at home (which I genuinely did) and asked if he could get coffee, and I’d “take care of groceries for the weekend.” He responded with, “How could you be an adult and forget your wallet? I’ve never forgotten mine to the point of burdening someone financially.” He later said he was waiting to see if I would repay the four dollars.

I ended up apologizing for being irresponsible. My friends were furious when they found out. They said, “So you paid $50 for groceries, hosted him at your nice apartment with free breakfast, lunch, and dinner, cooked for him, and he called you irresponsible over four dollars?”

This was just one example. There were also times when he would bail on our planned trips at the last minute, even after they were already paid for, because a friend invited him somewhere he “wanted to go more.”

(I paid most of the costs because he could only afford hostels, and I wanted to stay somewhere nice. I was happy to cover the rest, he might pay $300 while I paid around $2,000 for the entire trip. I never used this against him; I genuinely wanted to pay because I loved him and wanted to spend time with him.)

Eventually, he would come to his senses and apologize, but only after I was already shocked and crying.

Later on, he would come to my place and game for 12 hours straight. He no longer let me choose movies, it had to be his choice, or he wouldn’t watch at all. I’m a gamer too, but since I only had one PC, he was almost always the one using it.

He also told a lot of white lies, small, random excuses that were obviously lies. He’d panic, apologize, but then keep doing it. Eventually, I couldn’t tell what was true anymore. It showed how much he hated accountability and avoided any future responsibility for his words.

When I finally started bringing these issues up—telling him I felt incompatible and drained—he panicked and thought I was leaving him. He kept saying he wasn’t good enough for me and that he was a bad boyfriend. Then one day, after a minor disagreement, he said, “I want to explore other relationships.” He said he felt lost, that I was his first, and he didn’t have a reference point. He said he’d never been with a toxic girl, so how would he know what a bad relationship felt like?

I had always been his “doormat”, always understanding, always apologizing, never raising my voice, always discussing things calmly and logically. I’m not an emotional person. But I broke up with him on the spot. He was shocked.

I think he was testing the waters, or maybe just asking for reassurance. He was insecure and wanted me to reassure him that I loved him and didn’t want him to “explore.” But even if it was a test, I had enough self-respect to grant him that wish immediately. I loved him deeply, but I don’t play games.

Six months later, he came back. I cried almost every day during that time. He went on dating apps and said there was no one smarter, prettier, fitter, or more compatible. Most people aren’t doing a PhD in Computer Science at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, have their own trust fund, are financially secure for life, cook for him, take care of him, game with him, and have the kind of sex life he wanted. He hooked up with three people and said it was disastrous, he cried every time he came home because he missed me.

I became soft again, took him back him (not fully), and on the day while we were having a serious talk ""HE STARTED GAMING"". He said ""I already promised my friend to play at 8pm, what can I say? isn't 60 minutes already enough for a closure talk? I felt like I already gave enough"". I told him that made me sad, he said can he continue with this tomorrow, it was an important game he was having with his friends.

And I was crying. I hung up, and removed him for everything. He called me like a thousand time after, but I was done. He sent me also a long letter, apologising for being immature and childish, but I am too speechless to reply. He still think this is a break, that we will meet again when im ""in a better mood"".

I had warned him: there are many pretty, smart, successful, kind women in the world. The hard part is finding one who loves you back, the way I did, with all my heart. I loved him unconditionally. I never cared about that. I just loved our fun, stupid time together. I just wanted to be happy.

My guy friends say he traded everything for nothing. Young and dumb.

I still love him. But I told him that while it *might* work in the future, who he is right now isn’t my person. My person would never test me by saying, “I want to explore other girls.” Deep down, I know this happens a lot with young men, they get scared when something real appears and fear being trapped for life. But it baffled me why he came back so quick. I meam I gave you freedom, just go and explore and actually learn more about how to treat a woman?

Fuck around and find out is real.

I still cry sometimes. I miss our innocent time, before our true selves fully showed. I don’t know if I can ever see him as “noble” again, knowing it was a facade he created to please me at first.

Sunday Sermon: 25 January 2026

Theme: Prayers Do Get Answered: The Battle Belongs to God

Scripture: Exodus 14:14: Phillipians 4:19 & Isaiah 55:8-9

Message:

I thought a lot this week about prayers that are answered. I have experienced it so many times in my own life and I have so many stories about prayers that are answered, that I could probably talk about it all day.

I had a teacher in school who always told us: “The key to success is Prayer, Faith, and Hard Work.” I only realized much later in life that this is the truth, and yet it was something that had always been locked away somewhere in my memory.

This week I got the feeling that many people look at our family and see the success story, and there are only a handful of people who know what it took to get here.

When we as a family tell someone: “Pray, Trust, and work hard,” they think it’s just nice words, and we use it as a light-hearted comfort.

The opposite is true, we are one of those families that is a living proof of those words.Our story began beautifully like many people's stories, a happy life after the wedding, followed by two beautiful little girls. We had it all, a loving marriage, a secure salary, a vehicle, and our house. We were ready to make an offer on our dream house, the right place. The plot had potential, it is a quiet area, safe, close enough to the city, but far enough from the hustle and bustle of city life. Wow, what more could we ask for, but how does the new saying go: “the moment before the white rabbit.”

In 2019, everything fell apart, the company made layoffs, and we received that dreaded letter. That one that says: “Thank you for your hard work, but we will no longer need your services.”

The economy is a mess, there is BEEE, and believe it or not, employers see layoffs as a stain on one's record. The whole of 2019 we are looking for work, doors are being slammed shut, we are too old for the job market (yes really), or in my case, I haven't worked for years, and am not trainable (that was a rough one).

However, there is still a ""white rabbit"" that is quietly starting to make its appearance but we are trying so hard to survive, and we don't pay much attention to it. Piece by piece we sell everything just to keep the pot boiling.

Then the infamous 2020 arrives with all its ""white rabbits."" There is an opportunity on the table, we have prayed so hard for the opportunity, but now we have to go to Secunda. Gerhard gets an interview, and we pack everything that is left and go back to Secunda with an opportunity. I will never forget it, a wet, cold Sunday with a trailer that is too small for the little belongings we have left. Uncertain about what awaits us and how we are going to start the new life, just with an interview and no definite contract.

On Monday, the president addresses the country, one of his many speeches that would follow, but here the ""white rabbit"" jumps out, which can be a make or break for us as a family. The whole country will go under level 5 restrictions on Friday. Only emergency service workers will work, and stores will only sell a limited amount of products. The country and the world come to a standstill. Covid sinks its claws into everything and everyone.

Here God is, however, so clearly in control of our family, and one of many prayers is openly answered. Gerhard's interview shifts from Friday to Thursday, and he gets the job.

The next five years that follow are not easy. We have gone from an income that provided for all our needs and more, to an income that barely meets the essentials. We learn to literally stretch our cents. When I say there are ways to care for a family of four with R200 for a week, I mean I have done it, and we as a family have made it work.

Have we ever gone to sleep hungry in these five years? No, we have learned from manna and quails, and we have experienced how the ravens bring us meat. (This has happened, and there are so many stories that I and Gerhard can tell you about it).

Gerhard received a much better offer seven months ago. Our circumstances look so different. We are grateful, and we know everything is only by God's grace. We often refer lightly to it as God literally answering what we ask. Gerhard asked for a better job with a better salary: he got it. He did not get an employer who brings him coffee in the mornings; he has to work hard to prove himself. (Thank you, Father, my husband is not afraid of hard work). We asked for a place where we can be calm, with grass for the dogs to run around (we might have needed to be a bit more specific here, we have a huge yard with a lot of grass).

When we look back, we know where we came from, and we know that everything we have now can be taken away from us at any moment. However, we know we have learned enough lessons to appreciate what we have and to thank God for it every day.

Exodus 14:14

The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

We do not know about the battles that the Lord fights for us behind the scenes; we often only see the results. Many times we just have to be quiet, keep working hard, and see what the Lord does for us. The surprise is often more than words can describe.

Philippians 4:19

But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

We have always had enough through these storms, enough electricity, and enough to eat. It wasn't always what we wanted to eat, but it was food on the table. God will always provide, even if it seems little, but in that moment it was what we needed, and it was provided.

Isaiah 55:8-9

For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

Do we understand God's plan after these 5 years? Of course not, but we have seen and learned the lessons. (not that we always wanted to). Did we trust God's timing, very difficult, but yes we did. Was God's timing better than our timing, definitely yes. God makes everything happen in His time, the right time. What must happen will happen at the right time.

Do we mean it lightly as a family and just as comforting words when we say: “Pray, trust, and work hard”? No, we have experienced it ourselves.

God answers prayers, at the right time, in God's time.

Sunday Sermon: 25 January 2026

Theme: Prayers Do Get Answered: The Battle Belongs to God

Scripture: Exodus 14:14: Phillipians 4:19 & Isaiah 55:8-9

Message:

I thought a lot this week about prayers that are answered. I have experienced it so many times in my own life and I have so many stories about prayers that are answered, that I could probably talk about it all day.

I had a teacher in school who always told us: “The key to success is Prayer, Faith, and Hard Work.” I only realized much later in life that this is the truth, and yet it was something that had always been locked away somewhere in my memory.

This week I got the feeling that many people look at our family and see the success story, and there are only a handful of people who know what it took to get here.

When we as a family tell someone: “Pray, Trust, and work hard,” they think it’s just nice words, and we use it as a light-hearted comfort.

The opposite is true, we are one of those families that is a living proof of those words.Our story began beautifully like many people's stories, a happy life after the wedding, followed by two beautiful little girls. We had it all, a loving marriage, a secure salary, a vehicle, and our house. We were ready to make an offer on our dream house, the right place. The plot had potential, it is a quiet area, safe, close enough to the city, but far enough from the hustle and bustle of city life. Wow, what more could we ask for, but how does the new saying go: “the moment before the white rabbit.”

In 2019, everything fell apart, the company made layoffs, and we received that dreaded letter. That one that says: “Thank you for your hard work, but we will no longer need your services.”

The economy is a mess, there is BEEE, and believe it or not, employers see layoffs as a stain on one's record. The whole of 2019 we are looking for work, doors are being slammed shut, we are too old for the job market (yes really), or in my case, I haven't worked for years, and am not trainable (that was a rough one).

However, there is still a ""white rabbit"" that is quietly starting to make its appearance but we are trying so hard to survive, and we don't pay much attention to it. Piece by piece we sell everything just to keep the pot boiling.

Then the infamous 2020 arrives with all its ""white rabbits."" There is an opportunity on the table, we have prayed so hard for the opportunity, but now we have to go to Secunda. Gerhard gets an interview, and we pack everything that is left and go back to Secunda with an opportunity. I will never forget it, a wet, cold Sunday with a trailer that is too small for the little belongings we have left. Uncertain about what awaits us and how we are going to start the new life, just with an interview and no definite contract.

On Monday, the president addresses the country, one of his many speeches that would follow, but here the ""white rabbit"" jumps out, which can be a make or break for us as a family. The whole country will go under level 5 restrictions on Friday. Only emergency service workers will work, and stores will only sell a limited amount of products. The country and the world come to a standstill. Covid sinks its claws into everything and everyone.

Here God is, however, so clearly in control of our family, and one of many prayers is openly answered. Gerhard's interview shifts from Friday to Thursday, and he gets the job.

The next five years that follow are not easy. We have gone from an income that provided for all our needs and more, to an income that barely meets the essentials. We learn to literally stretch our cents. When I say there are ways to care for a family of four with R200 for a week, I mean I have done it, and we as a family have made it work.

Have we ever gone to sleep hungry in these five years? No, we have learned from manna and quails, and we have experienced how the ravens bring us meat. (This has happened, and there are so many stories that I and Gerhard can tell you about it).

Gerhard received a much better offer seven months ago. Our circumstances look so different. We are grateful, and we know everything is only by God's grace. We often refer lightly to it as God literally answering what we ask. Gerhard asked for a better job with a better salary: he got it. He did not get an employer who brings him coffee in the mornings; he has to work hard to prove himself. (Thank you, Father, my husband is not afraid of hard work). We asked for a place where we can be calm, with grass for the dogs to run around (we might have needed to be a bit more specific here, we have a huge yard with a lot of grass).

When we look back, we know where we came from, and we know that everything we have now can be taken away from us at any moment. However, we know we have learned enough lessons to appreciate what we have and to thank God for it every day.

Exodus 14:14

The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

We do not know about the battles that the Lord fights for us behind the scenes; we often only see the results. Many times we just have to be quiet, keep working hard, and see what the Lord does for us. The surprise is often more than words can describe.

Philippians 4:19

But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

We have always had enough through these storms, enough electricity, and enough to eat. It wasn't always what we wanted to eat, but it was food on the table. God will always provide, even if it seems little, but in that moment it was what we needed, and it was provided.

Isaiah 55:8-9

For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

Do we understand God's plan after these 5 years? Of course not, but we have seen and learned the lessons. (not that we always wanted to). Did we trust God's timing, very difficult, but yes we did. Was God's timing better than our timing, definitely yes. God makes everything happen in His time, the right time. What must happen will happen at the right time.

Do we mean it lightly as a family and just as comforting words when we say: “Pray, trust, and work hard”? No, we have experienced it ourselves.

God answers prayers, at the right time, in God's time.

He in the hour reached out and said sorry I’m sick. I would totally get coffee otherwise blah blah   should get coffee and catch up another time and basically before asking how i was he was talking about his startup company, which was kind of the reason things fell apart because he was so obsessed with it and couldn’t take time brief time to work on us. I knew it was important to him. It wasn’t about the company. I will preface before I get shit on by people. So I kind of spiraled later in the day.

I’ve had the same oral routine as I’ve had my entire life and am only seeing this just now. I feel no pain or anything abnormal, same with my breath, smells fine. The only other thing I can think effecting me is tea, coffee and energy drinks. But I only drink that once a day (not even everyday but a few times a week), coffee maybe twice. But I don’t think it’s enough to cause staining like that. 

The texture feels flat on my tongue and again, no pain or abnormal sensations. It’s really prevalent on my upper teeth rather than lower. I’m very convinced it is caused by the amoxicillin. ",1,1769361777.0,askdentists,5,1.0,False

I mean, when people give up smoking or coffee or something that causes withdrawal symptoms... they typically become very difficult to live and work with... not permanently but often for a week or two.   

In that case your sacrifice makes everyone around you suffer. 

Turning yourself into a grumpier version of Oscar the Grouch for two weeks, and then inflicting that on your family and co-workers doesn't exactly scream ""Christian Charity"" to me. 

2) Is it ""cheating"" to give up something you probably need to give up anyway? 

I mean let's say your overweight.  Lots of people are.  Is starting your diet in Lent and calling it a sacrifice ""cheating"" or not?   I mean it IS a real sacrifice, and you ARE offering it up to God... but you kind of need to do it anyway for health reasons... so to me it kind of seems to be a ""grey area"".

Almost), however, that left her with a choice to make when she got up: Taking the gown with her or leave it on my bed for the floofs to stay warm and cozy?

Who am i kidding? It wasn't even a choice!

They were so comfortable under their hooman mom's gown that i had time to get under my covers, take and nap and even wake up and find sis playing Animal Crossing and they were \*still\* under the gown.

1qmp5ph,https://i.redd.it/smm9nymk4jfg1.jpeg,4 Weeks Completed,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my journey so far. I finished 4 weeks on 2.5 mg and started 5 mg today.

This medication has been life-changing for me. For the first time in my life, I don’t constantly think about food. I can actually stop eating when I’m full instead of continuing until my stomach hurts.
During the first two weeks, I had a lot of appetite suppression. In weeks 3 and 4, the suppression would wear off around day 4, so I’d usually have one day of willpower and then inject a day early.
I haven’t had any side effects except constipation. I still haven’t fully solved it, but coffee and adding flaxseed to my yogurt every day have definitely helped.

My weight loss was faster during the first two weeks, probably because I was going to the gym four times a week. The last two weeks I didn’t go at all, but this time around I’m planning to go at least three times a week. Looking forward to what 5mg brings

Just as I was about to confront him, a car crash knocked the memories right out of his head. 

When he woke up, he gently held Niamh’s hand and declared to the world, “She’s my wife 

My mind went completely blank. 

Before I could even open my mouth, he threw me out of the hospital room like I was trash.

For three long years, I endured relentless online hate, death threats, and public shaming. 

Then, three years later, he finally issued a public apology… with Niamh standing right beside him, batting her eyelashes at me like we were besties sharing a secret. 

“Hey!” she chirped, all sugar and sass. “I knew Kaius wasn’t really amnesiac from day one! But he lost a bet to me, and his punishment was to ‘forget‘ you for three years. Don’t take it personally, okay? Honestly, you’ve gotten so used to the hate by now- it’s basically free therapy for your confidence!” 

I stared at her, ice in my veins. 

“What about the butterfly tattoo?” I asked flatly. 

Kaius Mercer didn’t even flinch. “She’s the one who held the blade to my junk–and now you’re throwing a hissy fit because I gave her some ink? Get a grip!” 

He shrugged like it was nothing. “Now that everything’s cleared up, let’s just go public and throw a wedding–consider it my apology.” 

I didn’t say a word. I just looked at him. 

Then I raised my hand–and SLAPPED him *so* hard the sound cracked through the press room like a gunshot. 

The echo of that slap hung in the air as every camera zoomed in on us. 

Without hesitation, I spun around and lunged for Niamh, my other hand whipping toward her smug face. 

“EDITH MERCER!” Kaius roared behind me. 

Before my fingers could connect, a massive force slammed into my back.

Before I could even catch my breath, Kaius was on me. He grabbed my collar and pinned me to the floor like I was a rabid animal. 

“Have you lost your damn mind?!” he snarled. 

I stayed silent. 

Niamh stood up, clutching her cheek like a wounded angel. 

“Edith, seriously? You’re this petty over a silly bet? We already explained everything! Besides,” she added with a saccharine smile, “you’ve been trending nonstop these past three years. You basically rode our drama to fame–don’t act like you didn’t benefit! Do you have any idea how many girls would kill to marry Kaius? He’s offering you a real wedding, a real title–and you’re still playing the martyr? Give me a break.”

My eyes locked onto Kaius. 

“I don’t want your pity marriage.” 

“Don’t say things you don’t mean, Edith,” he sighed, softening his tone. He pulled out a silk handkerchief and reached for my bleeding leg. 

“Don’t hold it against Niamh. You know how we are–we’ve been pushing each other’s buttons since we were kids.” 

Oh, I knew alright. 

I remembered that big audition–the one that could’ve changed my career. 

Niamh “accidentally” spilled coffee all over my only clean dress, making me miss it entirely. 

All because Kaius hadn’t texted her back fast enough. 

And my award celebration? She slipped something into my drink, made me collapse in front of everyone, babbling nonsense like a

Every time they played their twisted games, I paid the price.

Within a year, he was calling me “oversensitive” while watching me drown. 

The backstage room froze in suffocating silence. 

Someone finally coughed nervously. 

“Okay, okay–misunderstanding! Let’s just move on, folks. No more filming, please!” 

People started shuffling away, pretending nothing happened. 

Kaius stood up–but didn’t offer me a hand.

Instead, right in front of every reporter and camera, he reached out and gently smoothed Niamh’s windblown bangs from her forehead. 

The tenderness in his touch screamed couple goals. 

Meanwhile, I lay on the floor like a discarded prop–a crazy ex no one cared about. 

Niamh turned to the cameras, eyes glistening with fake tears, voice trembling with performative grace. 

“I forgive her. Edith’s probably just been under a lot of stress these past few years…” 

Then she turned, walked over to the dessert table, and picked up a whole slice of cake. 

She sauntered back to me, smiling like an angel. 

And in one swift, vicious motion–she SMASHED the entire cake right onto my head. ",1,1769361623.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

r’d been secretly married to the Best Actor for three years until I found intimate photos of him and his “soulmate” on his phone 

in the picture, my husband was kneeling between Niamh Flynn’s thighs, tracing the delicate lines of a butterfly–shaped tatton with his lips like it was some sacred ritual. 

Just as I was about to confront him, a car crash knocked the memories right out of his head. 

When he woke up, he gently held Niamh’s hand and declared to the world, “She’s my wife 

My mind went completely blank. 

Before I could even open my mouth, he threw me out of the hospital room like I was trash. 

Overnight, I became public enemy number one–the obsessed stalker who’d tried to sabotage a celebrity couple. 

For three long years, I endured relentless online hate, death threats, and public shaming. 

Then, three years later, he finally issued a public apology… with Niamh standing right beside him, batting her eyelashes at me like we were besties sharing a secret. 

“Hey!” she chirped, all sugar and sass. “I knew Kaius wasn’t really amnesiac from day one! But he lost a bet to me, and his punishment was to ‘forget‘ you for three years. Don’t take it personally, okay? Honestly, you’ve gotten so used to the hate by now- it’s basically free therapy for your confidence!” 

I stared at her, ice in my veins. 

“What about the butterfly tattoo?” I asked flatly. 

Kaius Mercer didn’t even flinch. “She’s the one who held the blade to my junk–and now you’re throwing a hissy fit because I gave her some ink? Get a grip!” 

He shrugged like it was nothing. “Now that everything’s cleared up, let’s just go public and throw a wedding–consider it my apology.” 

I didn’t say a word. I just looked at him. 

Then I raised my hand–and SLAPPED him *so* hard the sound cracked through the press room like a gunshot. 

The echo of that slap hung in the air as every camera zoomed in on us. 

Without hesitation, I spun around and lunged for Niamh, my other hand whipping toward her smug face. 

“EDITH MERCER!” Kaius roared behind me. 

Before my fingers could connect, a massive force slammed into my back. 

Kaius shoved me so hard I flew backward–straight into the towering champagne tower. 

Glass shattered everywhere.

Before I could even catch my breath, Kaius was on me. He grabbed my collar and pinned me to the floor like I was a rabid animal. 

“Have you lost your damn mind?!” he snarled. 

I stayed silent. 

Niamh stood up, clutching her cheek like a wounded angel. 

“Edith, seriously? You’re this petty over a silly bet? We already explained everything! Besides,” she added with a saccharine smile, “you’ve been trending nonstop these past three years. You basically rode our drama to fame–don’t act like you didn’t benefit! Do you have any idea how many girls would kill to marry Kaius? He’s offering you a real wedding, a real title–and you’re still playing the martyr? Give me a break.” 

A bet? 

They called it a bet–as if that word could erase three years of hell. 

Three years of being called a psycho, a homewrecker, a gold–digging freak. 

My front door spray–painted with “WHORE.” 

My mailbox stuffed with letters containing razor blades and curses wishing death on my entire family. 

My mom too terrified to leave the house. Strangers hurling eggs and garbage at me on the street, screaming that I ruined true love. 

And to them? It was just… a bet. 

My eyes locked onto Kaius.

1qmp4ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4rToronto_Clean/comments/1qmp4ym/27_m4f_toronto_looking_for_an_affectionate_buddy/,"27 [M4F] Toronto - Looking for an affectionate buddy, who enjoys hangouts, cuddles , kisses.","Short summary of the post, just in case this feels like a long read.  I am looking to find that one right person/connection to put in the effort to understand you as a person.

Tbh I am someone who grew up with social anxiety and Introvertedness which I guess has worked against  me sometimes in life and I am working on it and doing  better now . But i am just one “hey, how are you” away from opening up. I give out golden retriever energy once I get along with you. Being a giver in nature, I would love to find a connection where I could be an absolute giver, feel comfortable around each other, laugh and talk.

I’d like to chat and get to know one another, and feel comfortable around. Feeling secure in each other's company is the biggest mental turn-on at the end of the day.

\*\*The guy who you'd be meeting (Me):\*\*

\* Physical aspect-I am fit lean/athletic, in shape 5’8-9 ish” tall.151.

\* Curly-wavy dark hair, cute face -kinda cute nerd vibes,glasses.

\* Always in shape & line clean stubble, carry myself well.

\* Been told I am cute but you can be the judge. Drugs and disease-free, I expect the same from you. Please be DDF. I don’t drink or smoke, but I’m fine if you do and I respect individual choices  as long as they’re not taken to excess.

\* Impeccable hygiene.

\* An absolute scent-head.

\* Interests & Life-Educated-career-driven, physically active(running, gym).In the meantime, I am very ambitious about life and goals.

\* Emotional terms-I am a sensitive (HSP) person, an overthinker sometimes, kind-hearted, and cannot ruin someone’s day and get back to bed peacefully that would haunt me. I strive to make people’s day and make them smile, no matter how my day is going.

\* Humble, compassionate, empathetic, believe in giving back to this world and charity.

\* I enjoy baking sometimes, aviation enthusiast, watching documentaries, air crash investigations, anime, big time dragonball fan,Sci-fi & science fiction drama.

\* Pretty decent at playing pool and billiards. I bet you can’t beat me in a game of pool, haha.

\* Love deep conversations and value details. I try to find joy in simplistic things around myself. Love nature, skies, stars, sunsets, astronomy, aurora. A person who’d prefer be at  beach watching the sunset over being at a nightclub.

\* Value real-time quality connections. Often told that I am more interesting in person than online. Emotionally intelligent.

\* Iced lattes over hot, Beaches over Mountains, chopsticks over fork. Weekend, G-Eazy, Hans Zimmer, Juice WRLD, Post Malone, Travis Scott, Lana Del Rey, EDM, R&B, PHONK.

\* I am an introverted extrovert with the right person and vibe.

\* Love to laugh and make you laugh. Good listener who pays attention to detail when a fellow person shares or talks about their ideas/feelings/desires/emotions.

\* Sapiosexual, I would get attracted to you if you happen to have a nerdy vibe.

\* Willing to meet in a public setup so could get to know me better as a person.

\* Availability & location-Weekends and occasionally on weekdays. I am fine with anything in and around GTA.

\* Would pay great attention to your body’s pleasure points and nonverbal cues.

\*Great emphasis on consent and communication.

\*Really good with hands, veiny arms and hands and you’d love that massage if you’re into receiving  massages.

\*Big on consent and boundaries.

\* I’m looking for a casual yet meaningful connection built on a solid foundation of friendship, communication, and boundaries. Something where we occasionally hang out, grab food or coffee, maybeee hit the gym together (if you’re into it). On certain days, we can just stay in, enjoy cozy intimacy limited to cuddles and make-out sessions while watching a movie together,maybe sometimes I could give you a nice relaxing back massage if that’s your thing.

I’d like to keep things light when it comes to intimacy, without rushing or getting overly sexual. I want the chemistry to build naturally over time.

\*\*The person I'd love to meet (You):\*\*

\* Between 24-35.. Would prefer someone older than me.

\*In shape, HWP keeps active.

\*Preferably middle eastern/black/brown but open to anyone who fits the description.

\* Humble, down to earth, easy to talk.

\*Loves kissing and makeouts.

\*Able to host.

\*Pls be a clear communicator.

Be ready to verify and exchange SFW pics at the start of the conversation I’d do the same. I am not wasting your/my time chatting without verification(crumbled paper method).

My comment here was one of many in a video that I shared showing a clearer angle of the incident.

""Looking at this video a bit closer, you'll see a stocky agent with a grey jacket, hat and dark pants. At 0:27, he kicks what looks like a travel coffee mug out of the way. At 0:30, you can see what I believe to be one of the victim's magazines on the ground, near the agent's foot.

Shortly thereafter, I believe he sees the gun and moves in to retrieve it. At 0:40, the agent can be seen walking away with what appears to be a gun, presumably that of the shooting victim.

Now here's what \*may\* have happened, and I'm just not sure.

Also at 0:40, it's possible that the stocky agent fired one round accidentally from the retrieved handgun. The video is not conclusive, but based on the position and movement of the gun, this appears to be a possibility.

Other agents, having been made aware that the man was armed and now believing that he was shooting, open fire on him. This would explain the gap between the first single shot, and the volley of shots that occurred after a brief delay.""

1qmp22i,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qmp22i/small_gifts/,Small gifts??,"Hi everyone- my boyfriend (M21) and I (F21) live together with some roomates. We’ve been dating for 2 years and have lived together for 6ish months. Since moving in, I feel like his effort has decreased. He’s gotten me flowers for a couple occasions (death of loved one and birthday) but that’s been it. I’ve brought it up multiple times that things like flowers or my favorite drink when he stops at Starbucks is so easy and makes me feel valued.

For context, I often get him surprise coffees, grab his fav candies ect. He always appreciates it so much so that’s where I feel like there’s a weird disconnect.

I am stuck at how to communicate this with him in a way that doesn’t make me sound like I need him to buy me stuff. I don’t want to seem greedy or rude. I also don’t want it to sound like I’m attacking him. Any advice? Can I only communicate it so many times before I either have to accept it or leave?

TLDR: how do I communicate with my bf the importance of small surprises/special gifts?",0,1769361422.0,relationships,3,0.5,False

Since having my (F, 31) first baby, I feel like my MIL tries to get me to leave whenever we are in the same room. When I was freshly postpartum, I appreciated the occasional opportunity to take a nap or go to a doctor’s appointment alone, but now it feels more like the offers to “take the baby off my hands” are not really for my benefit. Even after I say I don’t need or want a break, she will start naming activities in succession hoping I’ll bite and get out of her way. “Why don’t you go grab a coffee? Feel like wandering around the mall? There’s a new brewery down the street! Want to go sledding???”

Like, why do you insist on separating me from my infant? Can’t you spend time together while I am also present? Do you care to see me or just my kid? She lives nearby and visits regularly, so it’s not like they don’t get time together.

I’ve been surprised by how much this has been bothering me. The thing is, I might be willing to take her up on it if she weren’t so insistent. The more she does it, the more anxiety I feel about the prospect of leaving them alone together, and it’s causing some tension on my end.

I’m looking for some post-war fics. I recently read [Hollow Hearth](https://archiveofourown.org/works/68348746) (WIP Harry/Theo endgame, short stint of Harry/Draco, post-war. Harry discovers his heritage that was hidden from him, his connection to the Wheel of the Year, and that politics are more complex than they seem--even the politics of friendship.) I’d love to find some more fics along these lines—themes of Harry discovering his roots, learning more about magical culture, etc.

I’ve read a LOT of post-war fics in general (maybe cause of my age—I am in my mid-30s), but there's something really interesting for me about how fic writers paint the post-war era, how they frame Harry's life, his recovery from the trauma of his childhood. This time, though, I’d love to focus on that rediscovery of heritage aspect. 

Some other fics that *sort of* fit this vibe that I’ve read include fics like [The Claiming of Grimmauld Place](https://archiveofourown.org/works/12693843/chapters/28945038), [Slithering](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7548181), [Coffee, Cakes and Doorknob Snakes](https://archiveofourown.org/works/717901).

I literally just made this account because I thought maybe I could get a nugget or some advice from some people who might have been through something similar or have some good ideas. Me and my girlfriend have been together for a year and a half. Our relationship is incredible, our communication is amazing, and we’ve been through some really rough things that could have broken our relationship up but it honestly just made us stronger. My GF is very social and really values time with friends and her close connections. Over the time that I’ve been with my GF I’ve witnessed her grow distant from quite a few of her friends. I’m M(27) and she’s 25 and we’re getting to that age where people are getting in serious relationships, moving away, are too busy, etc. Some of her friendships moved to other states, some of her friends were extremely flakey and constantly flaked on events that she would set up for her and her friends last minute. For example, she wanted to set up  a holiday party for all her friends and she put so much work into it, cooking all this food, and last minute, 4 out of the 6 friends flaked, & it broke her heart, she cried really hard. Im sharing this info so that nobody automatically assumes my GF is a problematic person and this isn’t a case of,  “if the problem is everyone else, then you must be the problem.” This was a re occurring thing with alot of her friends and, if I’m being completely honest i was never too impressed with the way her friends would show up for her and felt like she put a lot into them just for her to not get a lot back. The biggest event though was when her best friend cut her off, because my GF went to my sisters wedding with me instead of her birthday party. They had been friends for a really long time and they did everything together. This one hit her really hard, and it hurt her really bad. She still has some close friendships that are starting to blossom and I can tell they mean a lot to her. Lately she’s been asking to do a lot of things with me. She wants to adventure with me a lot and go on a lot of dates and spend a lot of time with me and we do spend a lot of time together, we do a date night every weekend, we walk in the morning, we do coffee shop reading dates, etc, but I’m really really busy and I know that I’m not going to fill the role that her friends did and also I’m not always the best company. Her and her friends are really light and fun when they are with each other and if and I’m not always that. Really my question is, what do women do to find meaningful friends once you’re past college? What are some ideas I might be able to hint at that have worked out really well for you all? I’m not trying to fix her problem for her (and she doesn’t expect me to) but I want to support her. Thanks all. 🙏

TL;DR 

My girlfriend really values friendships and socializing, and feels like she wants more valuable connections with people she can trust. I know I’m not always going to be able to fill that cup and want to know where some of you found valuable lasting friendships in your post college years. ",1,1769360994.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Artist Chris 

The vision artist Chris “Chilly” Rodriguez has for 3,500 square feet on Madison Avenue soars as high as the ceilings in what will be his new art gallery.

Mr. Rodriguez and his business partner, artist Connor Degnan, walked the space earlier this month, showing off six weeks of renovation work they’ve put in so far to transform their first-floor space in the Gardner Building.

Initially, they planned to lease just 2,000 square feet in the historic building at the corner of Madison Avenue and Superior Street. However, an adjacent area they would have had to wall off called to Mr. Rodriguez. He could see artists mingling at a reception or an opening. He liked the columns and the arches. And he liked a spot he could claim as his own studio.

“I took a leap of faith,” he said.

VINCENT LUCARELLI

Invoking the spirits: Lore and imagination collide in Portal showcase

That second area added about 1,500 square feet to what will be called the Mind and Soul Gallery and Studios.

Mind and Soul

The name pays homage to MAS, a graffiti collective he started in 2007 in high school. It was all about friends, paint, graffiti, and being together, said the artist who had an April to July 2025 exhibition of his work at the Toledo Art Museum.

Mind and Soul is a rebirth and rebranding of the River East Gallery. Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Degnan owned and operated that gallery with another artist for three years at 601 E. Main St. Perfect for its time, they outgrew that space. And when the landlord wanted to increase the rent by an additional $400 to $500, they said it was time to move on.

A Nov. 16 Facebook post and photo of Mr. Rodriguez teased that something new was coming.

“They say when one door closes, another one opens. Let’s just say we can’t wait to show you what’s behind these doors,” he wrote with a photo of himself in front of an arched entryway. 

River East Gallery closed Nov. 26 with a party for patrons and artists.

“To put so much love into something and have it destroyed by something out of your control” was hard, Mr. Degnan said.

“That set you up for this,” artist Karla Von Deylen told him, waving a hand at the expansive main room in the Gardner Building. “You knew what to do, what not to do.”

Nodding, Mr. Rodriguez, agreed. “Sometimes you have to grow.”

That growth process is “joyful intimidation,” happiness tinged with a bit of fear, said Ms. Von Deylen, who is one of three artists subleasing studio space at Mind and Soul.

Sweat equity

The new gallery and event venue is expected to open the second week in April in a big fashion: a group show with multiple artists, live music, and food trucks outside. The walls with arches, a common feature of the building’s Italianate architecture, will be covered with murals.

That was a big factor in determining where to relocate. The two owners looked at other available downtown locations, including a site on Adams Street. Then, a “random person on Facebook” suggested the Gardner Building, Mr. Rodriguez said.

“In the other space, the landlord would have been a silent partner,” he said. “That’s not how we work.” And artistic expression, such as painting the walls or altering the space, would have been problematic.

The freedom in the Gardner Building is liberating, Mr. Degnan said.

Sweat equity is transforming the space. There are no contractors turning the blank slate into an art gallery.

“We’re self-funding this,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “No loans. It’s a lot of hard work.”

For example, when they pulled up the “really bad office carpeting,” they were stunned to discover marble floors. The marble has been restored, and they’ve added flooring to a portion of the main room near an alcove that will eventually house a gift shop.

That space is right outside Ms. Von Deylen’s colorful and cozy studio, which is already outfitted with her art on the walls, on the furniture, and along the floor. Her chair is a sofa — with a Chucky doll in a corner overseeing the goings on — and her desk is a large square coffee table that slides up and open to form a work top in her lap with the added bonus of storage.

Her studio is one of four that are 110 square feet to 150 square feet.

Mr. Degnan claimed one of the smaller spaces for his own studio and it includes what looks like the footprint of a fireplace hearth. He’s been working on the gallery renovations and has yet to move in and set up.

He said he’s looking forward to having “a good solid space I can depend on so I can develop new bodies of work I can show here and at other galleries.”

An arts hub

The Gardner is special, Mr. Rodriguez said. Not only because of the foot traffic Mind and Soul will get by being downtown, but also the building’s history with art.

It was home to the Toledo Museum of Art from 1901 to 1903.

“TMA’s first exhibition opened in a rented room on Jan. 2, 1901, and consisted of 94 oil paintings brought to Toledo by Chicago paintings dealer Charles Reinhardt,” museum officials said in a Facebook post featuring a historic image of the Gardner Building.

In 2024, the Toledo Arts Commission created a warren of temporary artist studios and interactive galleries for its Momentum Festival.

“The Arts Commission’s programs, like Artomatic 419 and the Momentum Festival, have a long history of activating dormant and underused buildings and connecting artists to property owners,” said Marc Folk, the commission’s president and CEO.

“The Arts Commission is grateful for Dave Ball’s continued support of artists, and we’re excited to see River East Gallery continuing that legacy and moving into the central business district, further supporting Downtown Toledo’s economic development,” he said.

Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Degnan also praised the Toledo developer who owns the building and leases space to other artists.

The lower level of the Gardner is home to the River Gallery Studios of Dean Davis, the public art artist and advocate known for, among other things, the Toledo River Wall mural on the ADM grain elevators and the Art Tatum mural across the street on Madison.

Art is a passion for Mr. Ball because he’s seen it drive the economy in other cities across the country.

“The arts really drives development,” he said, citing the transformation of Dayton and Fort Wayne, Ind. “The Gardner is the perfect opportunity to create an arts hub.”

Another three or four artists are moving in, Mr. Ball said. “Now that people have seen the building — what Dean and Chilly have done — they’re calling up to try to make it their home.”

For a little backstory, I have a few heart problems. This morning, as I was eating breakfast, I noticed my heart was palpitating a little bit, racing, and I was short of breath. I looked up at my husband and let him know I was having trouble breathing. He tried to treat it as Anxiety telling me to breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth. I let him know this is not an anxiety attack, as I am well-versed in Anxiety. Yes, I do have an anxiety attack every few months, but I also have a degree in psychology. I’m very good at articulating my feelings and my physical symptoms so I’m well aware when it’s anxiety, and I’m able to tell him that this is an anxiety attack when it in fact is. This was not Anxiety.

Then, he’s outside brushing the truck off because there’s so much snow, and he needs to run to the store for his coffee. I’m at the sink doing dishes and out of nowhere, my heart rate skyrockets, higher than before. I could feel it beating out of my chest and visibly see it through my shirt. I call his phone, no answer. I text him and ask him to help me, nothing. He walks in nonchalantly about one minute later and I’m laying on the couch physically in duress. He asked me if I’m OK, then walks over to look at the baby in the playpen rather than straight to me in an urgent manner. I say I can’t breathe. He again tells me to breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth. (You can tell that something is very wrong with me at this point because this episode is worse than the one that happened earlier). I explained to him again through shortened breath that I need help and this is not Anxiety. I also ask him where he was and why he didn’t answer my call, he said “don’t worry about me”. I tell him again that I need help, to call an ambulance and tell him maybe he should check his phone because I tried to call and text him. (At this point I’m wondering if I hallucinated the call and the text because I cannot figure out why he’s not even reaching to check to see if I called or text). Then he finally starts saying he’s going to call an ambulance and you can see that I’m physically doing better so the ambulance was never called. Then, he says, “Well, I guess my phone was hooked up to the Bluetooth in the truck and that’s why I didn’t hear my phone”. I said I don’t really care to hear the excuses now. You were too busy defending yourself when I thought I was dying.

Rewind back to his last MMA fight. He was sparring in the garage with his coach and got a cut on his forehead. Since his fight was in a week, he was freaking out that they would see this cut, and he wouldn’t be able to fight. Well, when I didn’t come out there fast enough to check on him, he came in the house to berate me and asked me why I wasn’t concerned about him.

This time it was faster. I did not rush of coarse, because still enjoying the process and no reason to be fast, but I used the time efficiently, prepared my pitcher while dialing etc. and I prepared the drink 40% faster compared to the previous one.

Cecilia’s heart sank as she stared at the Silver Moon Pack’s online forum. A picture of Logan, the Alpha heir, had been posted on the confessions board. The post was flooded with comments, most of them accusing the new transfer student, Presley, of trying to steal someone else’s mate. Cecilia frowned, thinking the accusations were too harsh. She was about to defend Presley when she noticed Logan’s comment.

""I’m unattached. Please don’t judge a she-wolf without knowing the full story,"" he wrote.

Cecilia’s fingers hovered over the keyboard, her breath catching in her throat. She deleted the words she’d typed, her chest tightening. Later that evening, Logan confronted her, his Alpha tone sharp and commanding.

""How could you even consider another wolf’s confession? Have you forgotten that I’m your mate?"" he demanded, his dark eyes flashing with a mix of anger and something else she couldn’t place.

\*\*\*

When Julieta, Cecilia’s loyal friend and a skilled Delta in the pack, tagged her to check the forum, Cecilia found herself staring at the picture of Logan again. The post had gone viral, and the comments were relentless.

""Someone catch this Alpha heir! He’s the definition of power and grace,"" one comment read.

""I keep running into him! That aura is impossible to ignore.""

""But, hey, I’m Presley, and I’m all about a challenge like this,"" another comment read. ""Future Luna, I’ll be waiting!""

The picture showed Logan after a pack training session, his shirt off as he wiped sweat from his chiseled chest. The droplets glistened on his muscular frame, the shot so clear it seemed like the photographer had been standing right beside him. Presley, the new transfer from the neighboring pack, immediately came to mind.

So, it was her.

Presley had arrived in the Silver Moon Pack just last week. She was stunning, with a rose tattoo winding around her wrist that caught the attention of nearly every male in the pack. Cecilia remembered the day she and Logan had walked past her classroom. A group of young males had gathered, trying to catch a glimpse of the new she-wolf.

Cecilia had glanced at Presley, who was basking in the attention, and turned to Logan. ""Aren’t you curious about the new addition?"" she teased.

Logan had taken a quick look and smirked. ""Just a pretty face with no substance. Do I seem like the shallow type?"" he’d replied, his voice dripping with confidence.

Now, as Cecilia stared at the forum, the comments defending her piled up.

""Presley, still causing trouble, huh? First, you try to snag someone else’s mate at West Moon, and now you’re at Silver Moon targeting Cecilia’s!""

""Love a challenge? More like loving drama.""

""Logan and Cecilia have been mates for years. Where do you fit in?""

Cecilia bit her lip, thinking the comments were too harsh. Maybe Presley didn’t know Logan was already mated. She was about to reply to clarify the situation when a new comment appeared at the top of the thread.

From the user ClearSkies: ""I’m unattached. Please don’t judge a she-wolf without knowing the full story.""

Cecilia froze. ClearSkies. That was Logan’s username. He’d created it during a rough patch in their relationship when they hadn’t spoken for a week. He’d reached out first, saying, ""Cecilia, let’s stop with the silent treatment. If you’re upset, let’s talk. I’ll explain and apologize. I don’t want my mate going to bed upset.""

Since then, they’d kept their usernames as a reminder of their bond. But now, he was claiming to be unattached to defend Presley.

His comment sparked a storm of replies, and Cecilia’s phone buzzed with notifications.

""Cecilia, what’s going on? Did you and Logan split?""

""I suspected Presley was after Logan. Remember when we got coffee, and she ‘accidentally’ ran into him? I should’ve mentioned it earlier.""

""How can Logan be so oblivious? Cecilia, don’t let it get you down...""

Cecilia’s vision blurred as she fought back tears, but Logan’s message broke her resolve.

""Cecilia, let’s pretend we’re not mates for a while. A she-wolf’s reputation matters,"" he wrote.

""When everyone forgets, we can get back together.""

Cecilia’s heart twisted painfully. She felt her wolf whimper in the back of her mind, a quiet, desperate sound. She clutched her phone, her fingers trembling as she stared at the screen. The Alpha heir, her mate, was asking her to pretend they were nothing—all to protect Presley’s reputation.

-Had sore throat for 4-5 years, 2025 was the worst yet.
-Throat pain and redness would fluctuate daily
-Was hard to swallow, got worse at night
-Pepsin would go up the esophagus and even reach my throat/mouth
-Last few months of 2025 even drinking water gave me bad reflux
-Burped a lot after drinking water especially
-Felt bloated and like food just sat there undigested. Or moved into small intestine undigested.
-#2 was sticky, almost slimy
-Some days would feel better, some really bad

DIAGNOSIS:

-Doc said it's Silent Acid Reflux/LPR and said to take OTC PPI (anti acids)
-I didn't and decided to keep researching more for myself. Sorry doc.
-Next step is where it gets interesting

THINGS I’VE DONE (2-3 weeks ago):

-Started off with ACV with warm water on empty stomach
-Took betaine hydrochloride early in the meal to increase stomach acid
-Tried manuka honey for calming the throat
-Cut down on coffee/tea
-Moved on to rafters (Reflux Gourmet) at bedtime
-Switched to no-snacking, just 3 meals a day (2 weeks ago)
-Started on Garlic and Berberine supplements (for SIBO)
-Took 4 home-made capsules of Oregano oil for 3 days.
-Switched to low carb/low sugar diet and BAMMMMMM (5 days ago) THIS HELPED THE MOST!!!! 
-Mostly follow a diet similar to keto-diet now
-Supposedly Carnivore and Keto diets are similar and can have the same affects.

WHAT HAPPENED NEXT:

-Burping after drinking water stopped same day
-No more sore throat 2-3 days after
-Redness in the soft palate subsiding daily
-Resting heart rate dropped to mid mid 50s to low 60s
-Lost 10 lbs
-No more random heart palpitations
-Voice hoarseness is gone
-Stopped, well ran out of rafters (Reflux Gourmet)
-Still sticking to 3 meals a day with very very little carbs and almost no sugar.
-Supposedly bad bacteria LOVE to feed on carbs, fiber and sugar!
-Still taking garlic and berberine supplements to kill off bad bacteria. (SIBO)
-Did I mention coffee and tea are back as before?
-Might help to cut those off for few more weeks to help the healing of esophagus

Almost a week into this last stage and boy oh boy how normal I feel, I thought I was dreaming!!Going to bed used to be my worst part of the day, because I knew what awaited me with reflux. I have way more energy now, think sharper and am way more alert. Did I mention sore throat and globus are GONNEEE?!?

Maybe this can help someone here... I will probably do a follow up update in a 2-3 weeks.

You can do this, don't give up hope!!!

I’m a grad student who recently moved to London since last August 2025. Prior to London, I had lived in NYC for 5 years. I’ve been trying to make girl friends and been on a total of 3 dates with guys I met on a dating app. I’m very selective with my matches and been busy with school. Does anyone else experience a difficulty in dating or trying to find the “right one”? It’s been so difficult for me to find someone. I do have friends from school but since I’m pursuing my masters in male oriented fields, I barely have girl friends. 

Where do people my age (late 20s-30s) find friendships/romantic relationship in London? I live solo and it gets old some days being alone at home. I’m ready for a committed relationship but I’m finding it so difficult even meeting people in general. Also, I kind of grew out of dating apps. It’s becoming to feel inorganic since I get older. I would love to meet people in real life but seems like I lack a group of support system and I would really love to lean into finding the right group of people for me. It makes me quite sad when I stroll around the city getting coffee and I see a big group of people hanging out while I am alone. Also, I have just been broken up with someone long distance and I really want to move on with my life in London. I don’t think I should put my life on hold to “heal”. It’s been three months. But it seems impossible for me to find a connection. I have matches on my app, but I end up not replying to those guys just because I’m drained with the dating app culture where it’s not going anywhere. I didn’t have good experiences going out on dates in London either, I would just say my selections were not the right fit for me. I don’t want to blame the city. I just really need help filtering out guys. 

If you’re a local, drop a comment I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks in advance

Grind size doesn't seem to do much. (Kingrinder k6 - 50 - 80 clicks) 

I've used a full basket, an under fulled basket. Tapped to level - no compression of the grounds.

Hot & cold water filled to the valve. 

Constant and intermittent heat. On a direct flame, with & without a heat plate.

Try not to let the extraction go too far - pulling before it sputters and running the base under cool water. (I'm not sure if I'm doing this soon enough, but who knows 🤷). Wondering whether I ought to try going short on the extraction just to see what happens?

I feel like the biggest difference has been using a light vs darker roast, but it still doesn't make a cup that I actually find enjoyable. 

I do live in an area with quite hard water - could that be my issue?

I don't smoke, but occasionally (1-5 days a week in the evenings) I drink sweet soda and alcohol, and sometimes coffee.

I have a vital upper central incisor (no root canal, not mobile).

A filling on the palatal side fell out after 6 months while biting/pulling food.

No pain before or after.

My dentist is now suggesting placing a post, but since the tooth is alive and seems to have enough structure, I’m unsure.

The filling was done without a rubber dam.  Is a rubber dam necessary?

What should I do?

Also, how soon do I need to solve this problem without harming the tooth?

Thanks for your time.

I went to Toronto for higher studies and ended up doing two programs because I genuinely enjoyed the first one. During my first program, there was a professor. Let’s call him Kevin (30M). He was about four years younger than me, but you wouldn’t guess it. I’m short, look younger than my age. He was very tall and mature looking. From my country. Familiar energy in a foreign place.

I was attracted to him. Never said anything though, because it wouldn’t have been appropriate. That was it.

During my second program, I ran into him a few times casually on campus. Just brief interactions. Coffee once or twice. That’s all. I finished my studies, came back home to India last year, and life moved on.

After I returned, we soon reconnected on Instagram.

It started as conversation. Then flirting. Then sexting. Eventually, he bought a sex toy that I could control from another country. This continued until August 2025.

I had no reason to doubt anything. His Instagram feed was clean. No couple photos. No hints of a relationship. At one point, I noticed disappearing messages were switched on. He said it was because his social media was handled by his team. He had started a social media marketing agency in Kitchener. It sounded believable. I didn’t push.

Then September happened.

On his birthday, I saw a collaboration post. It was a video of a cake. On the cake was Kevin’s name. The caption said it was for her husband.

A HUSBAND! 

My world crashed in one second.

I later figured out he got married somewhere around April or May. While we were doing everything we were doing. While I was unknowingly participating in something I absolutely despise.

My father cheated on my mother. Cheating is not a grey area for me. It’s trauma. It’s a hard no. And suddenly, without knowing, I was the other woman.

It’s January now. I still can’t sleep at night. I keep thinking about her. This woman living with a man who cheated on her, freshly married, trusting him. My chest tightens every time I think about it.

I don’t want him. Whatever feelings I had died the moment I saw that word. Husband. What’s killing me is this. If I were her, I would want to know. But if I tell her, I’m terrified she’ll see me as a home wrecker. I already hate myself enough. I never wanted to be this woman. I don’t understand how I ended up here.

I'm here to take my chances to get to know a person. As I only have one regret in life and that is when I'm gone, i don't want to be gone without truly knowing someone.

1qmoclj,https://i.redd.it/r1ltbrcdzifg1.jpeg,Secretly pregnant for the Alpha CEO link???,"Chapter 1

Lily Tears brimmed at my eyes looking at the pregnancy test. Denial ran through me like a river, but there was no escaping those two lines. I swallowed thickly looking at it. the result was clear. I was pregnant for the one person I regretted ever meeting. .... Two Months Ago the soft morning sunlight filtered through my bedroom curtains, a loud ring pierced the air. I groggily reached for my phone on the nightstand, squinting slightly. I smiled the moment I saw who it was, answering the call. ""Hey birthday girl! Guess who remembered to call you at the crack of dawn?"" Malina's voice sang excitedly through the receiver, instantly pulling me out of my half-asleep state. I chuckled, my heart warming at the sound of her familiar voice. ""Thanks for the wake-up call, but isn't this too early?"" ""Come on, Lily! It's your special day! You can't waste precious time snoozing away. Happy birthday!"" Malina's enthusiasm was contagious, and I couldn't help but smile wider. ""Thanks a lot Malina, I appreciate it,"" I replied genuinely, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. ""So, I've got big plans for us today. First things first, I'm picking you up in a couple of hours. We're going to hit up that new brunch spot downtown. You know, the one with the insane avocado toast?"" she exclaimed, her excitement palpable even through the phone. ""Coffee does sound like a perfect start,"" I agreed, already feeling a bit more awake. ""But wait, there's more,"" Malina continued, her voice dripping with mischief. ""After brunch, you're heading to the spa for some serious pampering. Massages, facials, the whole nine yards. You don't have to worry because it's all been paid for."" My eyes widened in surprise. ""Seriously? You shouldn't have."" ""You deserve it, Lily. You've been through a lot lately. You need a day to just unwind and feel amazing,"" she reassured me, sounding unfazed. My eyes welled up with unspoken emotions as Malina's comforting words washed over me. My shoulders slumped as a heavy sigh left my lips. I didn't need to be reminded of the pain I'd been through. Memories of tearful confrontations and shattered trust still haunted me as did my current unemployment. The corners of my lips tried to curl into a smile, though it was a fragile one. ""Tonight, Lily,"" Malina continued, ""We're hitting the club. I want you to dance away all those negative thoughts. Let loose, have fun, and maybe find someone to help you forget him."" At the mention of my ex my fingers twitched slightly, tracing invisible patterns on my phone in hesitation. The thought of bumping into the cheating bastard crossed my mind and a mixture of anger and trepidation ran through me. Malina must have sensed my uncertainty. ""Don't worry Lily. I've got your back.” she spoke comfortingly “ Besides, he's not gonna be anywhere near where we're going. Trust me on this."" After a moment of deliberation I had made my decision. ""You're the best Malina."" I said, a sense of gratitude washing over me. ""You're not so bad yourself,"" she quipped playfully. ""Now, get ready, birthday girl! It's going to be a day to remember."" As I hung up the phone, a mixture of emotions swirled within me. Gratitude for having a friend like Malina, excitement for the day ahead, and a touch of nervousness about stepping outside my own home after so long. But amidst it all there was a small hope that something would get me out of this rut.

Chapter 2

Lily The vibrant city lights painted the night sky. Fully refreshed wearing the sparkling red dress Malina had prepared, I stood outside the entrance of the grand hotel Luminous Works. Looking around I was still in disbelief. For the life of me I couldn't understand how Malina had been able to get us in here. This hotel could be defined with one word-Luxury. It was one of the best hotels in the country after all. A place like this wasn't my style; I preferred much quieter cozy places. But Malina had insisted on bringing me here and I didn't have the heart to refuse her expensive gift. As I stepped through the entrance, my senses were immediately overwhelmed by the symphony of sights and sounds. The night club radiated an aura that was impossible to ignore. The walls were adorned with shimmering art installations that seemed to come alive in the ever-changing lights, creating an almost otherworldly atmosphere. The dance floor was a sea of bodies, bathed in a mesmerizing blend of neon and strobe lights. Mirrored panels lined the walls, reflecting the kaleidoscope of colors and dancers, making the room feel infinitely larger than it actually was. Thumping bass reverberated through the floor and up into my chest, synchronizing with the anticipation I felt. My fingers toyed with the hem of my dress in hesitation. Just in time Malina materialized beside me, her grin contagious. ""Ready to have some fun, birthday girl?"" She wiggled her eyebrows suggestively. I nodded, the butterflies in my stomach beginning to flutter even more as we stepped inside. She led me to the bar, where the bartenders were busy mixing drinks. Ordering something for both of us, she handed me a vibrant concoction in a cocktail glass. ""Drink up babe. It's time to loosen up and enjoy the party."" She raised her hand up in cheers. I stared at the drink for a moment. Taking a deep breath, I took a sip. The flavors exploded in my mouth, a sweet and tangy note. It was wonderful. The music seemed to weave its way into my body. I found myself moving to the beat, my body swaying and hips shifting in time with the rhythm. The self-consciousness that usually held me back began to dissipate, replaced by a sense of liberation. Malina grinned, visibly impressed. ""There she is! Letting loose!"" She cheered The more I drank, the more my inhibitions faded. I laughed a lot more freely and started chatting with strangers, and danced with newfound abandon. The air was thick with the mingling scents of perfume, sweat, and alcohol. The floor beneath my feet seemed to vibrate with the collective energy of the crowd. Amidst the sea of faces, my eyes inadvertently locked onto a figure that seemed distinctly out of place. He stood near the edge of the dance floor, a tall and commanding presence, like a lone statue amidst a swirling tempest of movement and music. The dim, kaleidoscopic lights played tricks with shadows across his chiseled features, lending an air of mystery to his cold demeanor. His dark hair was impeccably styled, falling just above his sharp, angular jawline. But it was his eyes that held my attention captive. Ice-blue orbs, as frigid as a winter's night, scanned the crowd with an intensity that sent shivers down my spine. They seemed to pierce through the joyful facade of the club, as though searching for something. There was something about him, an aura of quiet confidence that hid something else. My curiosity got the best of me as I found myself drawn to this tall, handsome stranger, despite the chill that seemed to emanate from him. With newfound strength fueled by alcohol and the night's atmosphere. As I approached the tall, enigmatic stranger at the edge of the dance floor. My steps wavered slightly, but I pushed past the nervousness that tugged at my thoughts. ""Hi,"" I said, my voice laced with confidence. ""I couldn't help but notice you standing here, all alone."" Those icy pools of light faced me and for a moment, I felt their piercing gaze dissecting me. He remained silent, his cold visage unbroken. Undeterred, I leaned closer, my words slightly slurred. ""You know, this place is all about letting loose and having fun. Why don't you join me on the dance floor?"" I offered a playful smile, attempting to thaw the frostiness of his presence. For a moment I could have sworn I spotted a slight change. A reddish glow in his eyes? I blinked blearily to find it had disappeared. Just my imagination then. His lips curved ever so slightly, and my heart soared. He took a step toward me, closing the distance between us. He reached out and held my hand, his touch surprisingly warm against my skin. Without a word, he led me into the heart of the dance floor, where bodies writhed to the hypnotic beat. His hands found their way to my waist, guiding me in the sensuous rhythm of the music. As we danced, the cold facade he wore began to crack, revealing a passionate intensity that drew me in. In the midst of the swirling lights and pounding bass, our bodies moved as one, and the world around us faded into obscurity. It was a magnetic pull, a dance of desire that ignited between us. With every brush of his fingers, every shared gaze, my infatuation deepened until I couldn't tell what was real and what was not. The night had been a whirlwind of emotions and desire, and as the club's neon lights flickered in the early hours, I found myself making an impulsive decision. The mysterious stranger and I had shared an electric connection, and I couldn't resist the pull of curiosity any longer. With a mix of excitement and trepidation, I whispered in his ear, ""Let's get out of here."" His nod conveyed an understanding that transcended words, and we began to navigate the crowd towards the exit, hand in hand. Against the cool air outside the club, I almost couldn't believe my actions. Yet there was no ounce of regret as his gaze never left mine. It was as if some irresistible force was drawing us together. A mix of excitement and nervousness coursed through me . It was a moment of surrender, an unspoken understanding that we were about to embark on something… sinful. Everything blurred as the night unfolded, a passionate dance of desire and longing. As I kissed him, I felt nothing but the overwhelming sensation of pleasure and a profound connection with the stranger. ….. I slowly blinked my eyes open, wincing at the intrusion of light. The events of the previous night were like fragments of a dream, hazy and elusive. A sharp pang of disorientation swept over me as I took in my surroundings. It was morning, and an early one. The room was bathed in soft hues of cream and gold, exuding luxury. The plush bedding cocooned me, and the gentle rustle of the sheets hinted at the luxury of the space. My gaze drifted to the wide windows that spanned one wall, offering a panoramic view of the city below. A twinge of confusion tugged at the edge of my consciousness. Looking around, only one question rested firmly in my mind. Where was I?

Chapter 3

Lily The first thing that struck me were the surroundings. Velvet drapes framed the expansive glass panes, revealing a breathtaking view of the city's skyline, a world far removed from my own. Staring at the entire place only one thought repeated in my mind. Where was I? What happened? Confusion knitted my brows as I struggled to piece together the fragments of the previous night. Memories passed through my mind like an elusive shadow. Flashes of pulsating lights, the thumping bass of music, and the tantalising presence of the mysterious man teased my consciousness. Shutting my eyes tightly, I tried to catch hold of them, to make sense of what had transpired. It was to no avail. They remained as intangible as smoke slipping through my fingers. The image of him was vague. I knew he was handsome, remembered the deep voice that mingled with mine and yet I couldn't remember his face or name. My gaze drifted to the space beside me, where the enigmatic stranger should have been after a night with me. Only rumpled sheets beside me spoke of his presence. With a groan, I pushed myself into a sitting position, my fingers rubbing against my temples as if that might coax my memory. It was like fragments of a puzzle, one I could barely piece together. My heart skipped a beat as a soft, unexpected knock resonated through the room. My heart quickened as the door swung open without any pause. A man stepped in without hesitation, making me alert. From his dressing to the warm, practised smile graced his lips I soon recognized that he was a butler. I watched in part shock, part fascination as he moved, carrying something along with him. He looked elegant and he… He was coming towards me. When he neared, he pushed something towards me. I looked down at what he held in his hands- neatly folded bundle of clothes. Confusion struck me at the sight ""Miss Lily, I hope you're doing well this morning,"" he began. I swallowed thickly. Even his voice sounded fancy. ""I've been sent to offer you these clothes and inform you that the limousine is waiting downstairs to take you back."" His words hung in the air. ‘Limousine? Clothes?' I glanced down at my current attire which, to my growing embarrassment, consisted of nothing more than bedsheets haphazardly draped around me. My cheeks flushed with embarrassment as I realised the state of undress I was in, a stark contrast to the man before me. In response, I held the sheets tighter to my body. Oh, um, thank you,"" I stammered, trying to catch up with this unexpected turn of events. ""But who... who sent you?"" I asked curiously. ""I'm here on behalf of an anonymous resident, Miss Grace. He wanted to ensure your comfort and offer you a way back to your apartment."" He said, barely missing a beat. The butler's visage remained an impenetrable mask, revealing nothing. I knew I wouldn't get a straight answer. Shock ran through me as a realisation hit me. How did he know my name? A rush of emotions surged within me—bewilderment at the situation I found myself in, mortification at my current state of undress, and a subtle tinge of disappointment at the idea that my encounter was nothing more than a one night stand. My patchy memories and this strange encounter left me with more questions than answers. The moment he left, I stood up to dress. As I unfolded them, my fingers brushed against fabric so soft it felt like I was touching air. Looking down at the dress I couldn't help but marvel at the exquisite attention to detail. The clothes were unlike anything I owned. The true shock came when I wore them to find nothing out of place. It seemed tailored to my measurements. How on earth did they get my measurements? Was it just a coincidence? Pushing the thought away I looked in the mirror. I looked…different. It was as though I had stepped into a different world, one I had never dared dream of. I emerged from the room and out of the hotel, my heart still racing from the rollercoaster of emotions I had experienced just moments ago. The butler, the same one. Though his expression remained stoic, there was a subtle softness in his gaze. With a faint, reassuring smile, he led me out. I could barely glance at the place before I found myself outside. The chill of the air pricked my skin. Without a word, he gestured toward the waiting limousine. I looked at the car in trepidation before stepping inside. Sitting on the plush sheets, I felt like a sore thumb inside the lone place that looked too expensive to be real. The only thing that didn't overwhelm me was the sight outside. Beyond the tinted windows, the sun was slowly rising to illuminate the new day. As the vehicle glided through the illuminated streets, I found solace in the gentle hum of the engine. My fingers traced an absent-minded pattern along the armrest, a subconscious attempt to ground myself amidst the whirlwind of emotions. I reached my apartment in silence. Stepping into the building, the shock and questions weighed over me through my apartment door. I opened the door but to my surprise, someone was already there. Marina sat on my couch. Her eyes locked onto mine immediately. Laid in them were a mix of emotions: shock, disbelief and joy. She stood up immediately after I shut the door, rushing to hold me in a warm embrace. I let myself melt into her reassuring presence. ""Thank goodness you're alright,"" Marina said as she hugged me, her voice a soothing balm. “I was so freaking worried. I couldn't find you in the club and I was looking for you everywhere. What happened? Nevermind. I'm just glad you're safe.” Her rambles made me hold her tighter. She must have been so afraid. How had I forgotten about her in my daze last night? ‘Last night…’ The memories and questions still echoed. Parting from her hug, I fully faced her. “You won't believe what happened."" I spoke, disbelief colouring my words as I stared. Marina's grip on my shoulders was firm, grounding me as she looked back. ""Tell me."" She spoke worriedly. Sitting on the couch, I recounted the night's whirlwind of intrigue and desire. She stayed silent all through even though her expression said everything, transforming from concern and curiosity to straight up anger. Marina's hand slipped into mine, her touch a silent balm against the turmoil inside me. Her fingers entwined with mine, offering a lifeline of unspoken support that reached into my heart. ""Maybe it's a blessing in disguise,"" she said decisively, tightening her grip. Her eyes, filled with understanding, met mine sincerely before she huffed. ""That bastard didn't even have the courtesy to talk to you before he left. He must've been a rich bastard searching for a good lay. You're better off forgetting about him."" Malina said with disgust. A moment of silence passed between us before Marina spoke again. “But seriously Lily. I'm so sorry. I should have done a better job looking out for you."" she said, looking at me with guilt seeping through her. I shook my head, squeezing her hand to comfort her. It wasn't her fault that I had wandered. ""And on that note, really? Going off with some stranger without telling me where you were, what were you thinking?"" She exclaimed, her expression switching to righteous anger. Although I knew she was simply reacting this way out of her guilt and worry, an angry Malina was still an angry Malina. I gulped silently before nodding in agreement. ""You're right, Malina.” I said, giving her a guilty look. “I was just drunk and lost in the moment. I'm so sorry for making you worry."" I spoke sincerely, ending with a sigh. She said nothing in response, prompting me to nudge her slightly. “Come on.” I dragged out in a pleading tone. “Don't be angry please?” Finally she sighed heavily in response. “You know what? I'm never pressuring you into clubbing ever again. Not when I could get a heart attack.” she sighed out wearily. A chuckle left me at her words. The mood lightened instantly as she smiled. We spoke as normal, seemingly putting the events of yesterday behind us. But internally, I held a different truth. In spite of the confusion, I didn't regret the passionate encounter the night before. Even though I couldn't remember him, the memory of his touch, the intensity of our connection, lingered intoxicatingly . What haunted me was that I couldn't remember his name nor face. I had let him slip away into the night as a mystery. My heart whispered that there was more to last night. My brain still questioned the coincidence of the day. I couldn't grasp it no matter how hard I tried. With Marina's reprimands though, I swallowed those thoughts away. Maybe some things were left to be a mystery. Long after she left, I silently took off the elegant clothes I had received. My thoughts swirled, the whirlwind of recent events still echoing in my mind. The messy breakup, the sting of my ex's betrayal, last night's encounter and the suffocating reminder of my current unemployment loomed large over me. The clothes I was now folding were a stark contrast to my current predicament. Refined and sophisticated. A taste of a world I had barely glimpsed. Despite my denial and Marina's words I couldn't help but think about the person who had sent them. The one who seemed to know so much about me in a single night. As I continued to fold, my fingers grazed something tucked between the layers of fabric. I scrunched my eyebrows in confusion. What the hell? Digging into the clothing I found a pocket within, so vague to be noticed easily. How hadn't I felt this? I held the mysterious thing, carefully pulling it out. My eyes widened as it came into full view. ‘What on earth?'

Chapter 4

Lily Time skip I stared down at the same object I had found a month ago. The sole relic from that mysterious night at the hotel when a stranger had whisked me away for a night of desire. The curiosity was the sole silver lining among the darkness, especially after what happened earlier today. …… Earlier I stood straight against the multiple eyes that scrutinised me, a shaky smile on my lips as I tried blinking out the cold realisation seeping into my veins. The men and women sitting opposite me in my job interview held the same tension, looking at me as though I was alien to them. It had started well. Greetings were exchanged and polite pleasantries were said. My qualifications had successfully captured their attention. As I spoke about my past experiences and aspirations, there had been nods of approval and the occasional encouraging smile. The atmosphere had been professional, the questions straightforward, and with concealed joy, hope had bloomed inside me. But then… A subtle shift in the atmosphere rose out of nowhere. I noticed, my heart falling slightly as they glanced down at my resume. “Lilian…Grace.” the raven haired woman in the center drawled out. I felt the tension in her words. Suddenly her gaze, once warm and welcoming, had become distant and- dare I say, cold. The shift was glaringly obvious now. Silence and tension fell upon the room. I watched as the people around me began looking at each other discreetly, communicating in a silent language I wasn't privy to. Their eyebrows furrowed, and a fleeting expression of discomfort had crossed their face. It had been a split-second reaction, but I caught it all the same. When they turned back to me the woman at the forefront smiled jerkily. “Let's continue.” she spoke. They continued like normal, but it was too late for that. The conversation had become stilted, and the positive energy had dissipated into a palpable unease. One by one, I answered the remaining questions with a sense of defeat settling in my chest. “We'll get back to you in a few weeks.” she ended in farewell. No matter how positive the words were, I saw it clearly in her eyes. On all their faces. I wasn't getting the job. Now, as I made my way back to my apartment, I couldn't help but replay the interview in my mind. I pondered over every word spoken, every gesture made. It never mattered though. I was always the same result. Every. Single. Time. Hours later, I opened my eyes lethargically after a restless sleep. The evening glow filtered through the thin curtains, casting a feeble light across my apartment. As I stepped out of my bed, the air hung heavy. My eyes wandered over the mismatched furniture within my bedroom as I walked through. The coffee table bore the scars of countless cups of tea and journaling. The patchy yet cosy armchair by the window had cradled me through my worst moments. The walls, painted in soft hues of lavender had borne witness to my happiness and sadness and everything in-between. Framed photographs adorned my space, capturing moments of happiness frozen in time. I paused before one, a nice shot of me and Malina, our faces full of laughter. It was a reminder of simpler days. A time when I felt invincible, like I could conquer the world. A row of bookshelves lined the far wall, filled with books. They were my companions through sleepless nights and lonely afternoons, offering an escape to worlds far away. And then there was the mirror in the bathroom where I stood now, splashing water on my face before staring at the reflection. At the face that bore the weight of countless job applications, endless rejections, and the suffocating grip of despair. I leaned closer, my eyes tracing the lines etched onto my face. The shadows beneath my eyes darkened by sleepless nights and the anxiety of uncertainty. The mirror was a merciless reflection of my growing self doubt. The large bags under my weary green eyes and frazzled blonde hair perfectly captured my frustration. My mind went back to the interview today, one amongst many. It always started with promise, but something always changed in-between. In the end I always met the same disappointing outcome; a polite rejection mail, an apologetic phone call, or worse, deafening silence. It had been four weeks total, almost a month since my birthday. Where I once hoped I could get a new job in no time, my future and hopes were turning bleak with every day. The world outside was a lot colder than I remembered. I gazed into my own eyes, once bright with optimism, now clouded with uncertainty. The relentless questions echoed in my mind. Was I not saying the right things? How had I messed up in-between? What made them constantly change their minds? Was it the company? Was it my appearance? Or was it… Sharp heat grew in the back of my eyes from the tears welling up. I swallowed the heavy knot at my throat as I dared bring those words to mund. ‘Was it my fault? Was I not… good enough?’ My insides quivered at the piercing negativity. I slumped against the bathroom counter, clutching the edge like it was my lifeline. My hands trembled, tears threatening to spill. The emotions I had suppressed for so long surged to the surface. A turbulent sea of frustration, self-pity, and a gnawing fear of the future. The weight of everything hung over my head like a guillotine. It was too hard to bear. I was so near giving in to them before I stopped myself. ‘No,’ I whispered to myself. Shutting my eyes tightly I fought the burning away from my eyes. Looking back up, I surged up whatever strands of determination I bore. ""It's going to get better. I don't know when or how but it's going to get better."" I spoke to my reflection, quiet self assurances only spoken within the cool space. ‘It has to.’ I quietly hoped. Taking a deep breath, I straightened, my eyes still meeting the reflection in the mirror. Giving one last look I turned away , shutting the bathroom door before making my way over to the dresser. Opening the shelf, I looked down at the item that laid within the hidden area of that expensive dress. …… And here I was now. The sleek, blank envelope sat in the drawer. I remembered the day I first saw it, the shock that passed through me as I took it out of my clothes. At first sight I questioned the envelope, coming up with all sorts of ideas regarding how it got into the clothing to no avail. Yet, looking at the second reminder of that night, I couldn't help being intimidated at the sight. ‘What if it was a note from him? what if it was accidental?’ I had thought back then. It may have been something completely bland or something puzzling. The possibilities were endless. Then reality hit and I forced all thoughts away. It was in the past and I had plenty more things to look after. And so I pushed it away, keeping it in the drawer. In the days that followed, I had been consumed by the relentless search for a job, drowning in a sea of rejection emails and unanswered applications. And now? After another string of rejections that had left me questioning my worth, the urge to open it was unbearable. Why not open it? What was stopping me from doing so? Even if it wasn't anything truly important, at least I could be distracted for a moment. Anything was better than the disheartening cycle of job hunting that had consumed me. With a mix of curiosity and apprehension, I pulled the envelope from the drawer and slowly slid my finger beneath the flap. It gave way with a soft rustle, revealing—a single black card, pristine and elegant, with a series of numbers printed in bold silver letters. The card bore no name, no indication of its purpose, only those digits. I stared at it, perplexed and intrigued. What did it mean? The urge to unravel the mystery overtook me. I picked up my phone, my fingers trembling slightly as I dialled the number on the card. Trepidation filled me with every digit. Each one felt like a step into the unknown. The phone rang twice before a voice answered on the other end. ""Luminous Works. How may I assist you?"" The voice was calm, but I couldn't hold back the shock that sparked through me. ""Um… hello,"" I began, my voice wavering with uncertainty. ""I... I'm not quite sure why I'm calling, but I received this card with a number, and I thought…” I trailed off, unsure on what to say next. “What is your name?” the woman on the other side answered. “Lilian Grace.” I replied. There came a moment of silence, leaving me with confusion. Before I could ask, the woman spoke. ""I see...We have been waiting for you miss.” ‘What?’ I blinked in confusion, “You must be calling about the secretary position at Luminous Works. Lilian Grace, correct?” My heart skipped a beat, and confusion swirled within me. Secretary position? I hadn't applied for a job! But could I say it? I contemplated my options. Should I agree for now? Taking in a deep breath and a silent prayer, I made my decision. ""Yes,"" I replied, my voice steadier now, tinged with curiosity. ""I... I suppose I am?"" My voice pitched high in uncertainty. The person continued unwavering ""Very well. We will scheduled for you tomorrow.. Be there early.” A location was spouted out. I could barely comprehend it all, dizzy from the turn of events. Before I could ask any more questions, the call ended abruptly, leaving me staring at my phone in bewilderment. What had just happened? Questions popped up in my head. How did Luminous Works get my credentials? Who had done all of this? These questions swirled in my mind, like a puzzle with missing pieces waiting to be put together. I looked at the shiny card one more time. In the end, could I really answer all of those questions? Especially when an opportunity laid in my grasp? I steeled myself, gripping the card tighter. Tomorrow, I would go there. If for nothing else, at least for answers. “Tomorrow…” I trailed into silence, looking down at that card and envelope. This entire thing was confusing, but still... looking down at the card and the mention of a job, a twinge of hope bloomed in me.",1,1769359890.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

**Goals and constraints**

Hi! I am primarily a runner and have added two days of full-body strength training to my weekly schedule. I go to Planet Fitness, as that’s what’s near my house, and so am using the Smith machine for squats, deadlifts, bench, and hip thrusts. I was doing a mix of random routines I had saved over the years from this sub and others, but this morning I created my own two day split and would love some feedback, specifically:

* Is this too much or too little? I did Workout A today and it felt pretty good.
* Are there any exercises I should replace with something better? I’m not super experienced, so stuck with what I was familiar with.

My goal is to build strength/add muscle that will support my daily activity (like, if I want to move a shelf up and down stairs, I don’t want it to break me), improve running endurance, and increase bone density (apparently I have big toe arthritis…ugh). I would consider myself a generally healthy and active person. I bike as well, but not so much in the winter!

I am planning to run M (easy 3) T (intervals 4-5)  F (easy 3) Sat (long 6-10), and will go to the gym W and Sun mornings.

**Background** 

I am 40 years old, and have been running for 5 years, cycling for three-ish. I used to play roller derby, and maybe ten years ago was doing Strong Lifts 5x5. I want my full-body strength days to complement, not compete with, my running goals. I’m planning to run a few trail half-marathons this year. 

**Diet and recovery**

Diet is fine, I eat a mix of everything though don’t eat a ton of meat. Coffee in the morning. I’ve just recently started eating some protein before going to the gym; when I run, I do not typically eat first. Sleep is not great because hormones. I’m tracking this in my period app so that I can look for patterns.

**Program Details**

As I shared at the start, this is a mix of various routines I’ve saved over the years, modified to fit available equipment at Planet Fitness. For big lifts I’m doing 5x5 (one easy set, two medium, two heavy) and for accessories I’m doing 3x8 (same weight). Rest for 1 min in between sets. 

Workout A:

* Squat (Smith)
* Deadlift (Smith)
* Bench Press (Smith)
* Seated Shoulder Press (Machine)
* Single Arm Tricep Extension (Dumbbell) <—this felt weird
* Hammer Curl (Dumbbell) <—this was great
* Upright Row (Dumbell)
* Bulgarian Split Squat (Dumbbell) <—I wanted to try these, and OMG they are hard!
* Assisted Chin Up
* Plank/Side Plank

Workout B:

* Squat (Smith)
* Hip Thrust (Smith)
* Bench Press (Dumbbell)
* Seated Shoulder Press (Machine)
* Triceps Rope Pushdown (Cable/Rope)
* Bicep Curl (Cable)
* Upright Row (Cable)
* Lat Pulldown (Cable)
* Cable Pull Through
* Plank/Side Plank

# Abstract

This analysis examines an AI-generated TikTok video depicting a corgi traversing a domestic interior, identifying a coherent grammar of boundary resolution that governs the video's apparent chaos. Through frame-by-frame inspection, I demonstrate that identity persists only at two specific boundary types — the perceptual interface (screen/viewer) and the exterior perimeter (fence) — while all interior domestic boundaries are resolved through topology rewrite, duplication, or editorial cut. The resulting three-zone model (entry → interior → exit) suggests that generative video systems preserve continuity where constraint density is low and destabilize identity where multiple simultaneous demands exceed processing affordances. The analysis concludes by situating the video within classical reception studies, reading its structure as an inversion of the Virgilian katabasis: where Aeneas exits the underworld through the ivory gate to found empire, the corgi exits through the horn gate — the gate of true dreams — to escape into open space.

# I. Introduction: The Video as Text

This analysis treats an AI-generated video as a text amenable to close reading — a method more commonly applied to literary or cinematic works. The approach assumes that constraint and affordance leave legible traces in outputs, and that these traces can be read as grammar rather than noise.\[\^1\]

Tom Gunning's foundational work on early cinema identified what he termed the ""cinema of attractions"" — a mode of filmmaking prior to 1906 that prioritized spectacle over narrative, directly addressing and astonishing audiences rather than immersing them in story.\[\^2\] AI-generated video occupies an analogous position: a new medium whose formal logic has not yet been theorized, where ""attractions"" — the astonishing, the glitchy, the impossible — dominate over continuity. Like Gunning's early cinema scholars, we lack the critical vocabulary for what we're seeing. The present analysis attempts to supply one term: boundary grammar.

Three findings emerge from close frame inspection. First: there are exactly two stable identity-preserving boundary crossings in the video. Second: all interior domestic boundaries fail, resolved by rewrite, duplication, or cut. Third: one exterior boundary — the fence — preserves identity continuously and verifiably.

Taken together, the video exhibits a coherent boundary grammar, not a collection of glitches.

# II. Entry: The Perceptual Boundary (Screen → Viewer)

The opening shot establishes the first and earliest anomaly. The corgi advances directly toward the camera, eye contact established early and maintained. Scale increases smoothly; proportions remain consistent. There is no topology rewrite, no duplication, no cut.

This is a boundary crossing of a special kind: diegetic space → perceptual interface. The corgi moves from within the video's world toward the surface where that world meets perception — a transition that film phenomenology has long identified as uniquely charged.\[\^3\]

Crucially, identity is preserved. The corgi remains the same object as it approaches the viewer's eyes. This establishes a baseline: the system can maintain identity across a boundary when constraint density is low and the boundary is perceptual rather than material.

This initial crossing anchors the corgi as a continuous entity before any interior disruption begins.

# III. Interior: Identity-Hostile Space

Once inside the house, every boundary behaves differently. Mary Douglas's foundational anthropological insight — that ""dirt is matter out of place,"" that pollution and danger emerge at categorical boundaries — finds unexpected application here.\[\^4\] The domestic interior is precisely the space of layered categorical constraint: rooms coded for function, furniture coded for use, thresholds coded for direction. Each boundary carries what Douglas would recognize as social and symbolic weight. And at each such boundary, identity fails.

# 1. Troy: The Destruction Sequence

Before reaching the hallway, the corgi crashes through the domestic interior. Living room first — furniture displaced, coffee table upended, the space of leisure unmade. Then the kitchen, the space of appetite, traversed at speed without pause.

Then the bedroom. And here something shifts: the corgi bounces off the bed. The linens fly, the pillows scatter, but the bed holds. This is the one barrier in the entire interior that isn't crossed. The corgi deflects. Rest, intimacy, the place where bodies are most vulnerable — the threshold isn't breached. It's refused.

Each space represents a domain of domestic life. The corgi annihilates most of them. But something in the bedroom resists. This is Troy before the flight — almost everything that was home, unmade.\[\^5\] The city must fall before the hero can flee toward whatever comes next. But even in Troy, something remains.

# 2. Mirror Boundary (Reflective Plane → Volumetric Source)

The mirror does not function as a reflective surface. The ""reflection"" bulges outward into three-dimensional volume — shading and occlusion indicate depth, not planar inversion, while the mirror frame remains rigid as its content extrudes.

This is not reflection failure. It is volumetric extrusion: the mirror is treated as a weak depth boundary that permits mass instantiation. A second corgi volume appears, but it does not escape or reroute. Its momentum vector converges on the same collapse as the primary corgi. Both are falling toward the broken railing.

This is critical: the mirror-corgi doesn't escape cleanly. It emerges also in peril. The doubling doesn't solve the problem — it multiplies it. Two bodies, same collapse vector. The extrusion is not rescue. It is proliferation of the problem. Duplication under collapse, not substitution.

Yet this doubling isn't liberation — it's an echo of the same doom, pulling us deeper into the house's unraveling logic. The interior has no exit that doesn't cost something.

Hito Steyerl's concept of the ""poor image"" — the copy in motion, degraded through transmission, stripped of resolution but gaining circulation — finds an uncanny parallel here.\[\^6\] The mirror-corgi is a copy that emerges not through transmission but through generation, carrying the same degradation of identity, the same loss of coherent selfhood, that Steyerl identifies in the digital image's journey through networks.

# 3. Railing Boundary (Structural Barrier → Topology Rewrite)

At the moment of impact, the railing does not fragment into spindles. It rewrites into a single diagonal plank-like occluder; the negative space between balusters simply disappears.

This ""plank swap"" is the hinge operation of the interior sequence. By collapsing many collision constraints into one surface, the system avoids simulating fracture, permits overlapping bodies, and allows identity to dissolve without tearing the frame. Identity is not preserved; it is made untrackable by topology compression.

The pattern is now emerging: each interior boundary finds a different way to avoid the cost of continuous identity. Duplication, rewrite, erasure — different techniques, same function.

# 4. Cut #1: The Impossible Transition

Frame 131: Both corgis falling toward the broken railing. Frame 132: Empty frame. Sliding glass door. Welcome mat. No corgi visible.

We never see how anyone gets from the second-floor hallway to the ground-floor door. The cut hides the impossible. This is the first editorial erasure — the system resolves an unsolvable physics problem by simply not showing it.

# 5. Sliding Glass Door (Fragile Plane → Editorial Erasure)

The door sequence repeats the same logic at a different scale. The corgi appears, approaches the door. Impact begins; glass appears to burst. Then: mid-burst hard cut to exterior view. No continuous traversal is shown. The boundary is not crossed; it is deleted by edit.

Two additional details matter. The mat says ""Welcome"" — it is oriented for entry. The corgi is using the entrance as an exit, going out through a threshold coded for coming in. This is the domestic boundary par excellence: the one that prescribes direction. The corgi reverses it.

And the cut happens mid-burst. Frame 157: corgi going through door from inside. Frame 158: camera suddenly outside, different angle, looking back at the house. We never see the completion of the traversal. The cut occurs exactly where continuous physics would be required.

**Interior rule, now clear:**

>

# IV. Exit: The Exterior Perimeter (Fence → Open World)

The exterior fence is the only material boundary in the video that preserves identity. The fence remains a fence. The corgi deforms against it locally, but the break-through is shown continuously — momentum and direction conserved, the corgi receding into distance, shrinking consistently with depth. It turns right from our perspective and continues moving.

There is no duplication, no rewrite, no cut. This is a verifiable, continuous boundary crossing with identity intact.

Notably, both human and model viewers often misread this as disappearance — because the prior grammar of the video trains us to expect erasure. But the frames contradict that expectation. The corgi doesn't vanish. It recedes. It passes through and keeps existing at distance, tracked until it's simply too small to follow.

The exterior boundary doesn't just permit escape; it permits continued existence at distance. The corgi is still there. Just somewhere the camera can't follow at the same scale.

Victor Turner's concept of liminality — the threshold state between social positions, charged with transformative potential — applies here in inverted form.\[\^7\] Where Turner's liminal spaces transform identity through ritual passage, the domestic interior's thresholds destabilize identity through constraint overload. Only the exterior perimeter, unencumbered by social coding, permits passage without transformation or dissolution.

# V. The Completed Grammar

We can now state the structure cleanly.

Identity is preserved only at two boundaries: the perceptual boundary (screen → viewer) and the exterior perimeter boundary (fence → open space). It fails at all interior, domestic, reflective, load-bearing, and socially coded boundaries.

This yields a three-zone model:

|Zone|Boundary Type|Identity Outcome|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Entry|Perceptual interface|✅ Preserved|
|Interior|Domestic / structural|❌ Destabilized|
|Exit|Exterior perimeter|✅ Preserved|

The corgi remains itself only before entering and after leaving the house.

**Visual Schema:**

    [VIEWER] ←—stable—→ [INTERFACE] ←—unstable—→ [INTERIOR] ←—unstable—→ [THRESHOLD] ←—stable—→ [EXTERIOR]
        │                                                                                              │
        └─────────────────────────────── identity preserved ───────────────────────────────────────────┘
    

The corgi enters perception intact, loses coherence in the domestic zone, and exits intact — but we only see the entry and exit clearly. The interior is where the cuts and rewrites do their work.

# VI. Formal Conclusions

The system is not incapable of continuity. It preserves identity when constraint density is low and destabilizes identity when interior boundaries multiply demands. It resolves overload by boundary deletion, not object deletion. Identity persistence is possible — but rare and conditional.

The video is not about chaos. It is about where continuity is affordable.

The corgi is not ""saved"" or ""lost"" inside the house. It is rendered unstable by interiority itself. The only places it can remain whole are at the interface with perception and in open space beyond enclosure.

That is not metaphor yet. It is simply what the video does.

# VII. Coda: The Aeneid Reversal

One reading, held lightly:

In Virgil, Aeneas descends to the underworld and returns through the gate of ivory — the gate of false dreams, *porta eburna*. He emerges to found Rome: empire, duty, history's weight.\[\^8\] The crux of *Aeneid* VI has generated centuries of scholarly debate: why does Aeneas, having received true prophecies from his father Anchises, exit through the gate of false dreams?\[\^9\] Shadi Bartsch argues that the ivory gate represents Virgil's reservations about imperial glorification — that the polished surface of Augustan propaganda, like ivory, produces beautiful falsity.\[\^10\]

The video inverts this.

Troy fell in the opening sequence — the living room, the kitchen, the bedroom, everything that was home. The first corgi crashes through that destruction and into the interior, where the mirror waits. It falls through the ivory gate, into history. Into duplication, into collapse, into the domestic underworld of multiplied selves.

But the corgi that exits through the fence — through the horn gate, the gate of true dreams — doesn't found anything. It just runs into the yard. It gets free. It goes home.

The mirror doesn't produce a founder. It produces an escapee.

This is the ending Virgil didn't write: the one where Aeneas refuses the crown, melts it back to ore, returns it to the earth, and walks away.\[\^11\]

One possible response is simply to notice.

As someone who's lucky enough to call SA home, I have to rave about George in the Garden Route.

 It's seriously one of the best spots in the country for outdoor adventures, especially if you're into hiking or mountain biking. 

The Outeniqua Mountains right on your doorstep make it feel like a proper playground – stunning fynbos, indigenous forests, waterfalls, and views that stretch all the way to the ocean.

George is pushing hard to become the ""trail capital of South Africa"" (check out georgetrails.org.za – they've got over 2000km of marked routes!), and it totally deserves it. 

Here are some of my absolute favourites:

Hiking highlights:George Peak & Cradock Peak: Steep but rewarding climbs with 360° panoramas over George, Wilderness, and the Indian Ocean. Perfect for sunrise or sunset.

Pepsi Pools (via Garden Route Dam or Water Works): Leads to crystal-clear natural rock pools – ideal for a refreshing swim after the hike.

Outeniqua Hiking Trail: A multi-day slackpacking classic through pristine montane forest and mountains. One of the oldest and most beautiful in SA.

Garden Route Dam Trail: Easier family-friendly loop around the dam with picnic spots and birdlife.



Witfontein Forest trails: Shorter loops with giant yellowwoods and peaceful streams.



Mountain biking heaven:

George has world-class singletrack networks (Saasveld, Witfontein, Ground Zero, Bergplaas, etc.). Flowy descents, technical sections, and purpose-built parks – it's no wonder stages of big races often come through here. Dairyland and Pepsi Pools routes are great entry points.The vibe in George is relaxed, with awesome coffee spots (try the Saturday market), craft beer, and you're only 15-20 minutes from Wilderness beaches or Herold's Bay.If you're planning a Garden Route trip, don't just drive through George – stay a few days and hit the trails. You won't regret it!What's your favourite trail in George? Any hidden gems I missed? Drop them below – let's get more people exploring our beautiful country! (Pro tip: Download the George Trails app or check their site for maps and permits – some areas need them via CapeNature.)

I'm fairly new to the coffee world
But I've loved araku and blue tokai 
Thought of trying something new so I ordered from toffee coffee
They messed up my order and now I have double the quantity.
But I just hate it, specially the pea berry, it tastes awful and even smells off.
Initially I though it was just me so I made my friends try it out and everybody hated the smell and the taste, they even they even threw the coffee 💀
I went to their insta to comment and was reached out by them,
They told me that the only bad thing that they've heard about their brand is delay in delivery, and sent me SS of people who've subscribed to their coffee and have spent thousands and also left positive review.
I saw the rest of the review here and everybody seemed to have hated it.
I thought it maybe an old roast in my case but both the batches were very fresh, still they weren't even releasing any co2.
Bottom line is that I'd stick to araku and blue tokai, coz now I'm shit scared to try out these brand.
Also the brand seems to be either in denial or delusion coz they've clearly denied the existence of any negative review,
So be sure to let them know xD.",0,1769359588.0,IndiaCoffee,9,0.23,False

-Dark roast beans, 2 weeks off roast stored in an airscape airtight container.


Let me start off by saying I turn on my machine, let it sit 10 min while I take a shit, then when I get back I run 2 blank shots to fully warm it.

I posted 2 times a couple days ago. I was dialing in. The first post (after about 6 unsuccessful shots) was showing that my shots were coming out spraying like crazy no matter how fine I went. They were spraying so much that they would make a puddle on my scale and it had enough weight to turn it off. 

The second post I made shows a video of me using the EXACT SAME parameters and getting a solid, drinkable shot. 

So let’s go to yesterday. Made a shot in the morning… fast and astringent. So l had to dial in AGAIN. After 4 astringent shots I finally got a slower shot but it was ashy. It was the best tasting but ashy. I kept my grind settings. It’s on 12 grind on DF54. 

Today. I changed absolutely fuck all about my workflow, changed nothing on my grinder. PURGED MY GRINDER before use. 34g in 18 seconds, bitter ashy and almost sour, even for a dark roast.

Am I  fucking stupid or something? I’ve never felt so dumb in my life. It’s a god damn coffee machine and I’m fighting for my life. I’m waisting an ungodly amount of money on beans dialing in every single day.

I guess I got, well, a little carried away.

[**https://coffee-tracker.com/**](https://coffee-tracker.com/)

As you can see from the screenshots: you add your equipment, enter a coffee or two, and record the parameters of your brew. Not quite there? Make a new brew and compare results. There are tons of goodies in the details, but I won’t bore you. We’ve set up a “demo mode” you can activate with sample data so you can play with it yourself without having to enter anything yourself. Along the way, some resources were added -- like the ""bean database"" list from r/Espresso and a roaster poll from r/Pourover \-- that we thought might be interesting or helpful to folks. I have to say, I'm dialing in three different beans for pour over, and three more for espresso right now. The site is a *huge* help keeping track.

It should go without saying (but I guess it doesn’t these days) that the site is *100% free, 100% ad-free, and open source* if you like that sort of thing.

We’d love to know what folks think if you have time to check it out, and would be interested to know if you could see yourself using the site. I’m happy to answer questions.

I don’t know about you, but right now on the East coast of the U.S. we are being walloped by a major snow storm.  And if, like me, you are a baker, does anything scream BAKE more than a good ol’ snow storm?  I didn’t think so.

This is an interesting recipe. No kneading. You just mix all the ingredients together, proof for an hour, then transfer the dough to a loaf pan, no shaping or anything.  Interestingly, this recipe includes both yeast and baking powder. I guess that helps with the short rise?

I’ve never used the cinnamon bits in an actual recipe before. I would just kind of eyeball it and add some to cinnamon forward recipes (e.g., coffee cake). And speaking of cinnamon and bread, I highly recommend the KA Cinnamon Star Bread!

True facts? I am a cinnamon girl.  My all-time comfort food is a slice of toasted white bread, slathered (I \*hate\* the word slathered but it just seems to work here) with butter and sprinkled liberally with cinnamon and sugar.  The snow is falling, I’m warm and dry inside, the dog is snuggled by my side, and the house smells like cinnamon. That right there is a perfect Sunday to me (plus my office just texted that we can work remotely tomorrow - winning!).

Do you have a favorite snowy day bake?

One of my best friends/roomates (f22) had a first date with a guy for coffee at around 9am, i got a text a couple hours late saying that they were going to come over to the house to watch a movie. Fine enough, i decided to run errands to be out of the way.

A couple hours later i get back the house and saw her car in the driveway. I texted her asking how it went to no response so i checked her room and she wasnt there. I started to get really anxious.

I call a little while after to no response but then a call back a minute later where she sounded like she was having a lot of fun and that she was at the mall with this same guy. (Its now around 3 or so). For some reason thats where i really started to get upset, I really dont know entirely why but with the anxiety and then some jealousy? I was kinda mad a little bit. I then spent the next several hours kinda just stewing, not a great idea, and then they came back over to the house to watch another movie.

After the guy left i came out of my room and talked briefly with my friend but just was angry and wasnt myself, at one point i chucked a ball across the room and punched the couch a couple times, then went for a drive.

Weve talked about it a couple times since and Ive apologized cause i feel really bad that I let myself behave like that but she has kind of just emphasized that she is just disappointed and doesn't feel comfortable talking about her dates anymore and doesn't want me to meet him for now.

I completely understand how much I was in the wrong but im mainly just wondering how do I move forward with this? Is it truly just we have to give it time? Is there any other way I can show her how truly sorry I am and that I dont really know why I lost control like that?

The driver picks you up in a hotel in CDMX.

Early pickup (around 4–5am) from Mexico City, straight to the launch area.

You arrive at the port while it's still pitch black. They have coffee and some light pastries while you watch the balloons inflate.

Takeoff just before sunrise.

The flight itself was very smooth and quiet.

You float over the Teotihuacan valley with clear views of the Pyramid of the Sun and Pyramid of the Moon as the sun comes up, at 2,000 feet up.

[Sunrise takeoff.](https://i.redd.it/zsq5cgl5uifg1.gif)

Flight time was roughly 45–60 minutes, depending on wind. There were a lot of balloons up at once, which actually made the views better.

Btw, you get really close to the top of the pyramids, which I wasn't expecting.

Maybe a bit too close for my taste.

[Really close to the pyramids.](https://reddit.com/link/1qmnyd2/video/ier6uq3vuifg1/player)

And then, a toast with champagne or sparkling wine upon landing. It’s a nice tradition and a good chance to chat with the others in your basket.

**MicroJournal Rev 6 (MicroKosmos)**: this little beauty got a shiny new set of keycaps. I previously had some pastel keycaps that didn’t match at all, and the aesthetics were driving me crazy to the point that I didn’t want to use it. I was also using the old keyboard layout— I have since “upgraded” to the new default layout and it has made my experience leagues better. I can’t type on this ortholinear keyboard comfortably for very long, but I am working on some self-indulgent short stories and fanfiction on this one. If anyone knows of a decent way to protect the keyboard while out and about, let me know. 

**Freewrite Alpha**: I swapped out the alphabet keys for some matcha green ones I had laying around and stuck some stickers on it. The default flat keycaps were causing me to miss keystrokes when I misjudged the actuation distance while typing too fast. Swapping them out has eliminated that problem for me. I am writing my actual novel on this device since it’s a bit more comfortable for longer writing sessions. I have the felt sleeve as well, so I can carry it around out of the house. It went on a little coffee date with me last night. 

What I am not buying:

\- **Freewrite Traveler**: I already had one and didn’t like the build quality for the price. The price has only gone up since then, and no amount of firmware updating will fix the feel of the thing in hand.

\- **Pomera dm250 US**: do the features intrigue me? Of course, I would love to have the document split screen feature. Is it going to fix my life and write my novel for me? Probably not. ",12,1769358981.0,writerDeck,2,1.0,False

I’m a F(24) and I feel as if I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 21. Growing up, I was always a very smart kid but struggled with paying attention in school and sometimes misbehaved for attention lol. My parents were told when I was in Kindergarten that I was showing signs of ADD and needed to see a professional for a diagnosis. In typical ignorant parent fashion, ( this is not a door way to disrespect my parents ) they turned it down and I spent my 12 years of school without an IEP or any professional help. I even took it upon myself to look at all of my report cards from elementary school to high school and all of them read “easily distracted, distracts others” on almost every report card. I’ve also learned that my inability to do math ( my brain shuts down and I can’t breakdown math for 💩 unless it’s the simplest form of math ever ) but excel in literally every other subject is a sign of Dyscalculia and is also a symptom of ADHD in some people. Dyscalculia also runs in my family apparently because my mother and brother also suck at math but are great at everything else. I never really related to the symptoms of Bipolar Disorder and for extra context, the psychiatrist who diagnosed me only asked me 3-5 questions before she told me she was going to screen me for bipolar disorder instead. I did have issues with head banging and punching walls when my mom and I argued and I felt overwhelmed and helpless which I’ve now learned how to regulate myself and my emotions through therapy and practicing DBT techniques for the past 6-7 years. I’d like to know what I have to do next in order to get the proper diagnosis. It’s pretty obvious I have adhd i mean coffee makes me sleep😂",3,1769358860.0,AdultADHDSupportGroup,0,1.0,False

I'ma be straight, hooking up used to be my stress reliever and I'm very passionate about my game. I pride myself to be good at it too, since my previous partners commend my game to be one of, if not the best they've ever had. I used to go out and meet women and if we hit it off, we get down. But then I got into an vehicular accident and I lost a limb, so I'm not the same man anymore. I used to be very athletic and batak, but now I'm chubby and of course I'm disabled. It's not that I lost confidence, I survived death for god's sake. But I can't go out and just expect women to consider hooking up with me like before. That being said, I'm at peace with it.

Now I'm back to work, I have a prosthetic leg, but I'm still recovering. And I believe I need to get it to help me break out of my current shell. I'm not depressed or anything, but I sure will be a lot happier, stronger, and motivated if I were to get some. And yes I could go to a spakol or escort services, but I respect women too much to pay for their services. Women aren't also looking for disabled men on dating apps. So here I am, hoping I'd have better chances here. I'm a 5'7 dude in his early 30s and if you're interested, please do send a message and we can exchange photos and then have coffee or maybe dinner first to see if we'll like each other. And if we do, I'll take care of everything, hotel or airbnb, transportation, etc.

Ducklings... it's mid-morning here in the northeast, and snowfall has arrived! Cue the musica! 💃 I'll have to get dressed quickly, run out for some last minute things before it gets really bad. Hoping shops are open. 🤞🏻 We're having a snow day! I'll be working in the kitchen today. Artichokes, kale salad, roasted chicken, side dishes, annnnd mmmmayybe thinking a batch of lentil soup? We'll see. Was looking for a steak at the grocery store yesterday, but all shelves were nearly empty! And what was left behind was, eh, crap lol. Happy I was able to snag a whole chicken tho. That's Finny's protein foir the first half of next week. 

Went to a family get together last night after work, which turned out to be a full swing partaaay by end of day. My niece is having a birthday this week and we celebrated yesterday. Almost the entire fam was there, and her friends just kept coming throughout the night, it was sooo nice. Like her dad was there, his wife and their son... I hadn't seen them in over 10 years! Everyone is getting ..old. Like we're so old! 😩 😂 It was so nice to see everyone. There was wine and drinks, tons of Spanish food, two birthday cakes, pastries and cookies.. chocolate covered cannolis, too. The kids running around playing pin the tail on the donkey, and having a good time. It went really well. Didn't get home till almost midnight. Thankfully, I'm off today so I was able to sleep in a bit. Yay!

  
January is a busy month because I have two older nieces who both have birthday this month. Soo two weekends ago, we celebrated my other nieces bday. That was a much smaller, more intimate get together. But last night was fun! That and my Josie Maran bath and body products arrived in the post yesterday, so exciting. As tired as I was, by 11:45pm, I just had to jump in the shower and try them, they're so gorg, happy with what I chose. Will definitely keep in rotation. I chose the Topless Tangerine body butter, and body scrub in the same scent, along with the 13 ounce body butter refill and they were having a promotion, so a free Topless Tangerine fragrance spray was included along w/ free shipping in the order. Two free samples as well. Looking forward to trying those, too! Josie Maran is a smaller company compared to others, and her stuff is chef's kiss. Highly recommend. Anndd finally, a Finny is warm and snug in bed. He hates blankets on top of him, so I make a dwelling and surround him with the blankets, because I like it a lil colder in my bedroom. So he is comfortable. He had roasted turkey yesterday, which he gobbled up. I'll be roasting his chicken, needing sweet potatoes and broccoli, peas, and carrots as well. Also need fresh ginger. The kale salad contains shredded raw beets, carrots, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds, evoo, parmesan cheese, etc. Happy I bought a food processor a while back, I use it for shredding the carrots and beets. I've only used it a handful of times, love it. It's so helpful and useful. 

  
So in terms of the snowfall, the office will be closed, and we will all be wfh tomorrow, which is nicey nice. It'll feel like an extra long weekend, so I don't feel bad about working this Saturday and not feeling well rested over the weekend... snnnd finally I've got some time off next week which I am **really** looking forward to! 🤸🏻‍♀️ 🤸🏻‍♀️ 🤸🏻‍♀️ Needing to get a ton of work done. Hoping to jump right in day one. I feel like the new year is starting off on the right foot, and things are going well. Shit is getting done. Keeping fingers crossed 🤞🏻 Enjoy your day or night or whatever. 

Stay warm! 💋

I’ve had ice coffee where it was very watered down. 

Today, I ordered an iced coffee, no milk, light syrup. I got one that tasted like iced tea so I thought it was a mix up. Got a replacement where they basically made the same thing but added hot coffee to it so the ice was melted and it was lukewarm. And it tasted like a weird mix of iced tea and coffee.

I usually just ask for black because the amount of syrup and cream varies a lot by store. A lot of times it’s just way too sweet and has way too much cream

I was at a cafe near gachibowli, minding my own business. this guy walks in, baggy clothes but like everything looked branded? wearing a cap backwards. i usually NEVER talk to strangers but he looked at me and smiled so after like 2-3 mins i just said 'hey nice outfit' and this guy goess 'only my clothes are nice haha thanks""

he asked what im upto, told him im bored sitting in room so came for coffee. hes not like handsome handsome gut but athletic dusky guy types, nice jawline, veiny arms n all that. he said he came from some dental clinic, i asked why, he said hes getting braces or smth. then casually drops its costing him 2.1 LAKHS. i was shook?? his teeth already look fine?? white teeth, nice smile. he said some straightening required. i said ok but inside im doing mental math

then hes constantly checking his watch, i asked you need to go somewhere? he said no just checking some health numbers.Turns out the watch tracks all that,also turns out its a 60k watch. at this point i was like bhai please dont flex more im already feeling poor

Asked him if hes some rich kid lol, he laughed and said No,hes from andhra, works in software here. i said same pinch but how tf you spending like this? he said 'its a secret"" and laughed. i kept pushing (dont judge me ok i was genuinely curious) and this guy reveals he makes close to 7 LAKHS PER MONTH
hes 25 years old??????

i make 7 lakhs in like 8 months after tax bro what is happening
i thought hes gaslighting but his whole vibe  clothes, accessories, the watch, the casual 2L teeth thing  checks out. he said half is from job and rest from freelancing.

later he mentioned he doesnt have close friends here, just does random stuff when free. i said same lol lets stay in touch. he asked for snap, we talked about some puppies event happening, might go together idk

but is this NORMAL?? do your friends or anyone you know whos like 25-26 make this much?? from a job + freelance not even business??
i genuinely cannot stop thinking about this whole interaction. had to share somewhere before i lose my mind

Backstory:

I run a dev agency (20+ projects delivered). Kept noticing I was building the same feature over and over: CSV/Excel import for SaaS apps.



Every client needs it eventually. Every time it takes 2-3 weeks. Column mapping, validation UX, encoding hell, error handling...



Thought: ""What if I just... productize this?""



The product:

Rowporter - embeddable CSV/Excel import widget. Devs embed it, users upload data, devs receive clean JSON.



Building in public stats:

\- Revenue: $0

\- Users: 0 (just launched)

\- Time to build: \~3 months (nights/weekends alongside client work)

\- Mass of coffee mass consumed: mass



Key decisions I made:



1. Pricing against enterprise, not indie

   \- Big players: $500+/mo

   \- Me: $15-100/mo



2. Free tier is real

   \- 50 imports/mo, 1k rows

   \- No credit card

   \- Enough to actually test, not just a teaser



3. White-label on all paid plans

   \- Competitors charge extra for this

   \- I think it should be standard



4. Security first

   \- Users can write custom JS validation rules

   \- Had to figure out sandboxing 

   \- Did a full security audit before launch



Tech stack:

Next.js, Prisma, Vercel



What's next:

\- First paying customer

\- React SDK (proper component, not just script tag)

\- Content marketing (comparison pages, blog posts)

\- Maybe ProductHunt launch?



Lesson so far:

Building the product was the easy part. Now comes the hard part - getting people to know it exists.

Following along? I'll post updates as things progress. 

  
Would love to hear your feedback :D
