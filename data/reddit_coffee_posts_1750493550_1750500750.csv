Please note that this is not Encore ESP. It‚Äôs the normal encore. 
Since this is the upgraded M2 burr, you can potentially do espresso but it‚Äôs still not ideal as the step adjustments are bigger. 

This grinder is 3 years old, but the new M2 burr is less than a year old. 

It‚Äôs working in perfect condition.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.

**Can I come along?**

Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.

What if I don't want alcohol?

No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today*\*\*

*No: Nope, try next Monday*\*\*

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

*Monday*\*\*

** we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

Chapter 1

You‚Äôd think after all these years, the discomfort would fade. That I‚Äôd stop feeling like an outsider in a place I‚Äôve entered a hundred times. But every time feels like the first. I knew I didn‚Äôt belong here to the second we stepped out of the car.

The Monroe Gala was built for bloodlines, old names, old money, old rules.

Even the champagne looked smug. The chandeliers glittered like they were judging me. Everyone wore confidence like tailored silk. And me? I wore the safest dress in my closet.

Navy. Modest.

I walked in beside Rhys Carrington, my husband, on paper. My partner in name. My mistake in every other language. He didn‚Äôt look at me. Just checked his cufflinks and scanned the crowd like a predator looking for a better opportunity.

People turned when we entered. But not for me. Never for me. I was the afterthought standing at his side, the girl no one remembered inviting.

Arielle Carrington, Rhys‚Äô sister, clocked me immediately.

‚ÄúGod, he brought Celene,‚Äù she muttered to her date, voice just loud enough, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt realize we were doing charity cases this year.‚Äù I smiled like it didn‚Äôt slice. It always did. But I‚Äôd grown good at bleeding quietly.

Vivian Carrington, my husband‚Äôs mother, didn't even blink when her eyes met mine. She didn‚Äôt nod, she did not even bother faking it.

She just turned to the woman beside her and said, ‚ÄúSome girls marry up. Others just claw their way in through the side door, uninvited.‚Äù

I stood taller. Rhys didn‚Äôt reach for my hand. He didn‚Äôt even glance at me.

We made rounds like every other year. He kissed cheeks, talked about profit margins, name-dropped hedge funds like old friends. I smiled when expected, laughed when cued.

The perfect placeholder.

The accessory that didn‚Äôt speak.

Sometimes he touched my back, just a soft press between my shoulder blades. A signal. A reminder.¬†*Play the part, Celene.*

And I did. Like I always had, because I was his wife. Not the woman he introduced with pride. Not the woman whose hand he held with certainty. Just the one who existed in the background, quiet, convenient, replaceable.

We were in three glasses of champagne when I finally spoke.

‚ÄúDo I have a purpose here tonight,‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above the music, ‚Äúor am I just the body keeping your tie from blowing in the wind?‚Äù

Rhys didn‚Äôt even flinch. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make this harder than it has to be.‚Äù

‚ÄúHarder for who?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou? Or your mother, who still can‚Äôt say my name without swallowing bitterness?‚Äù

He exhaled like I was a problem. ‚ÄúYou wanted to come.‚Äù

I looked at him then. ‚ÄúI wanted to matter.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt answer, he just stepped toward the podium and tapped his glass. The room fell silent like it was trained to obey him.

‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen,‚Äù Rhys began, flashing that polished smile he wore better than any watch, ‚Äúthank you all for being here tonight. It‚Äôs always an honor to stand among visionaries.‚Äù

I waited for the rest. The usual speech. Something safe. Something rehearsed.

Instead, he dropped my hand.

‚ÄúAnd while tonight is about progress,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI want to share a personal update.‚Äù

My spine went rigid. I already knew.

‚ÄúCelene and I have decided to part ways,‚Äù he continued, clean, calm, and professional. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for the time we‚Äôve shared. But it‚Äôs time for a new chapter. I‚Äôll be building both my personal life and business future with Bianca Caldwell‚Äîas my partner in both.‚Äù

There it was‚Äîa name that landed like a slap. Two tables away, Bianca smiled, all teeth and practiced charm. She was the granddaughter of the investor Rhys had convinced to pour money into Monroe Industries. And I knew exactly how he got that¬†*yes*.

Vivian‚Äôs face didn‚Äôt move. Arielle grinned like it was her birthday. The crowd buzzed. Gasps. Whispered reactions. Flashing lights. And me? I just stood there. Still. Numb.

‚ÄúYou planned this,‚Äù I said under my breath, barely audible.

Rhys‚Äô voice didn‚Äôt waver. ‚ÄúI did what needed to be done. Clean break. Public clarity.‚Äù

I stared at him. ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt clarity, this was a public execution.‚Äù

His eyes darted to the cameras. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not create drama.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou already did,‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúYou handed me to a room of people who already wanted to see me bleed.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better this way. Bianca‚Äôs‚Ä¶ more aligned with my future.‚Äù

My throat tightened. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm what? A baggage?‚Äù

He shrugged slightly. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt carry dead weight anymore, Celene.‚Äù

Celene‚Äôs POV‚Ä¶

You‚Äôd think being humiliated in front of half of Manhattan would be the worst part.

It wasn‚Äôt. It was the silence that followed, the kind that wraps around your throat and dares you to breathe.

I locked myself in the hotel bathroom, perched on the toilet lid like it was the only thing holding me together. My heels dug into the tile, my hands trembled like I‚Äôd been caught in a blizzard. And maybe I had, just not the kind with snow.

Buzz. Buzz. Buzz.

**E! News: Rhys Carrington Confirms Split‚ÄîSeen Cozying Up with Caldwell Heiress at Monroe Gala. Page Six: Corporate Bombshell: Carrington Ditches Wife for Billionaire Princess.**

I didn‚Äôt even read the rest. I just turned off my phone and dropped it in my clutch like it was contagious.

I pressed both hands to my chest. Don‚Äôt cry. Not here. Not now. I wasn‚Äôt going to give Vivian the satisfaction, or Arielle, or Bianca, or the photographers camped outside the ballroom like wolves waiting for a fall.

I fixed my hair in the mirror. Pulled the dress higher. Smoothed the mascara. My eyes were red, but no tears had fallen. That was something, at least.

Back in the ballroom, everything felt louder. Glasses clinked, heels clicked, voices murmured. And every single one of them shifted when I walked in.

Vivian turned her back on me like clockwork. Arielle leaned into a blonde in sequins and stage-whispered loud enough for half the room to hear, ‚ÄúAt least now the family name isn‚Äôt tied to a nobody.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt react. I just smiled that sharp, tight smile. The kind that makes your gums hurt. The kind you wear when your skin is crawling but your pride refuses to flinch.

Then I saw them. Past the crystal chandelier, near the edge of the private patio. Rhys and Bianca. His hand on her lower back. Her fingers looped through his tie like a claim. Their lips met, slow, sure, the way a man kisses a woman he chooses. The way he‚Äôd never kissed me in public.

And for the first time, I felt‚Ä¶ still. Not angry. Not shocked. Just cold. Like I had finally stopped pretending I was anything more than a phase he needed to erase.

I didn‚Äôt look away. I didn‚Äôt storm off. I let myself absorb it. Every second, every brush of her lips on his, every laugh that followed, every look that said she was always the plan. I walked out the ballroom doors into the winter air. Cameras flashed, reporters lunged.

‚ÄúCelene, any comment on your husband‚Äôs announcement?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you know about Bianca?‚Äù

‚ÄúWere you blindsided?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt blink. I didn‚Äôt speak. I just walked through them like fog, my navy dress stiff against the wind, my heels sinking into the sidewalk with purpose. I made it to the end of the block before I let myself stop. I turned around slowly. Looked up. There they were, framed by the second-floor windows. Bianca in red. Rhys beside her, his hand now in his pocket like nothing had happened. Like I‚Äôd never existed.

I didn‚Äôt cry. I didn‚Äôt scream. But my jaw clenched so tight I thought my teeth might crack. I stared up at that glittering hotel tower, at everything I was walking away from. At everything that had already let me go.

And I whispered, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll regret this. Every last bit of it.‚Äù Then I walked. Not because I knew where I was going, but because standing still meant I was still his. And I‚Äôm not his anymore.

What happened in the party only means one thing, I was discarded away like a fucking trash. I need to get out, finally letting myself free after years of being in hell. I used to believe that he cared about me. Now, I‚Äôm in front of their house, a house that used to feel like yours, and realizing you were always just a guest.

The front door swung open before I could knock. Vivian Carrington, Rhys‚Äôs mother, stood there in a satin robe and pearls like she was hosting a brunch for socialites instead of watching her son‚Äôs marriage burn. She didn‚Äôt even try to fake warmth. Just scanned me head to toe and sighed. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd show. Thought maybe you‚Äôd gotten the hint by now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here for my things,‚Äù I said, voice flat.

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù She stepped aside like she was doing me a favor.

Arielle, Rhys's sister, was lounging at the top of the stairs in one of Rhys‚Äôs old college hoodies, holding a mug she didn‚Äôt deserve. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget the dresses,‚Äù she called down, grinning. ‚ÄúThough I doubt you‚Äôll need them wherever you end up. Do baristas even wear gowns?‚Äù

I ignored her. Vivian didn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúAt least now Rhys can choose someone who fits. Someone worthy of his name.‚Äù

I walked past them without blinking. My heels echoed across the marble like punctuation. Not rushing. Not stumbling. Just moving forward. Because if I stopped, I might actually feel all of it. Then I saw him. Rhys, leaning against the doorframe of the living room, arms crossed. No tie. No apology, just watching.

I stopped two feet from him. ‚ÄúIs it true?‚Äù I asked, voice low. ‚ÄúThat you meant it. The public divorce. The new future. The girl in the red dress.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt flinch. ‚ÄúYou heard me say it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to hear it now. From you. No stage. No cameras.‚Äù

His jaw twitched. ‚ÄúYes, Celene. It‚Äôs true.‚Äù

My throat tightened, but I didn‚Äôt let it show. ‚ÄúWhy her?‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúShe makes sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe makes sense?‚Äù I echoed.

‚ÄúShe fits, okay? She fits the world I‚Äôm building. Her family. Her connections. The way she walks into a room and everyone already respects her.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt?‚Äù

Rhys didn‚Äôt look away. ‚ÄúYou were‚Ä¶ fine. But you were always trying too hard. Always watching, waiting, apologizing for taking up space.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúSo you wanted someone born for the spotlight. Not someone who had to fight to be seen in it.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt deny it. ‚ÄúYou were exhausting to explain. And I got tired of pretending.‚Äù That one landed.

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúAnd here I thought love was supposed to be patient.‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in patience. I‚Äôm interested in power. Progress.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd peace?‚Äù I said bitterly. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt I that once? ‚ÄòTo my wife, my peace.‚Äô Remember that?‚Äù

Rhys didn‚Äôt answer. He didn‚Äôt have to.

I smiled bitterly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you the divorce papers tomorrow. If this will make you happy, I'll let you go‚Ä¶‚Äù

I passed through him and went inside my room. My old room felt smaller than I remembered. Or maybe I just wasn‚Äôt shrinking anymore. The bed was made, but not mine. No lavender sheets, no books on the nightstand, no hint I‚Äôd ever been there.

I opened the closet. My dresses hung in dry cleaner bags, too pristine, like someone had already started erasing me politely. I packed slowly. No tears, just calculation. Then I found it. The drawer. The bracelet, the love notes, the anniversary perfume.

*To my wife, my peace.*¬†I carried it all to the fireplace. One by one, I threw it in. The bracelet, the letter, the bottle he said smelled like me. The fire didn‚Äôt flicker, it devoured. Like it had been waiting, too.

I stood in the bathroom, stripped bare. No mascara, no ring, no more pretending.

‚ÄúThey think I‚Äôm broken?‚Äù I leaned closer to the mirror. My reflection didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know a damn thing.‚Äù And when I walked out of that house for the last time, I didn‚Äôt look back. Because you don‚Äôt grieve a place that never opened the door for you to begin with.

I promised myself I‚Äôd hand it over in person. Not for closure, not for dignity. Just to show them I wasn‚Äôt running, I was returning finished.

I stood in the Carrington foyer one last time, envelope in hand. No bow, no note this time, just signed divorce papers sealed inside and the weight of three wasted years. I placed it gently on the entry table like it wasn‚Äôt the burial site of their perfect narrative.

Vivian was the first to appear, gliding past the stairs in a pearl-covered robe that probably cost more than the car I learned to drive in.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù she said, loud enough to carry through the house. ‚ÄúLet her go. Good riddance.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt flinch. But God, it still burned. Arielle didn‚Äôt bother pretending. She was sprawled on the couch, legs crossed, phone in one hand, iced coffee in the other.

‚ÄúSend me a postcard from wherever discarded wives end up,‚Äù she said with a smirk.

I stood in the foyer and looked around. The art I was never allowed to touch, the family photos I was never invited to be in, the piano I wasn‚Äôt good enough to play. I took them all in, one by one. Memorizing the rooms that once swallowed me whole. Not for nostalgia, but to remember the battlefield I‚Äôd been crawling across while they smiled for the cameras.

My eyes landed on Vivian again. The woman who once leaned in and told me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt smile so big. You‚Äôre not the face of this family.‚Äù  
She‚Äôd always lower her voice when people asked how we met. Never once called me her daughter-in-law. Just¬†*her*.

Then there was Arielle. She laughed when I spilled red wine on her silk runner. Corrected me in front of Rhys‚Äôs friends like it was a game. Called me¬†*desperate*¬†for trying to plan his birthday dinner.

And Rhys? He was upstairs now. Standing on the landing, hands in his pockets, jaw tight. Watching. Saying nothing. Moving even less. Typical.

I let myself look at him. Just once. The man I spent years trying to please. The man I used to believe would fight for me. He looked at me like I was something he had to scrape off the bottom of his success. And for a second? It almost broke me.

But instead‚Ä¶ I smiled.Not the soft kind. Not the kind that pleads for peace. No. This was the kind of smile that makes a promise without saying a word. The kind that says:¬†*you will crawl for what you‚Äôve done*.

His eyes shifted. Just barely.  
Good.

I turned toward the front door, set the envelope on their coffee table, and walked out.

Chagee : RM12, tastes good, fragrant Jasmine Green Tea taste and light milk taste, refreshing, came with free cooler bag. In terms of taste I think this was the best one.

Beutea : RM10, tasted like heavily scented tea, felt more thirsty after drinking rather than refreshed. Came with a free cooler bag. Most appealing packaging for me.

Bingxue : RM7, tasted almost similar to Chagee‚Äôs but with heavier milk taste. Packaging usually dark blue but came red this time.

Tealive : RM11 for Whipped Cream on top, RM10 without. All I tasted was sugar and no tea. Good if you need an excuse to just drink sugar.

Zus : RM12, bitter tea taste and not much fragrance, ( could be because of tea being steeped at too high temperatures ), not too bad.

Overall Winner : Bingxue, almost half the price of Chagee despite being a slightly inferior tasting version of it",2,1750499951.0,Bolehland,1,0.67,False
1lgsykp,https://v.redd.it/8whg0m2u698f1,Patience + recall training during dinner.,"Cats are trainable and can be disciplined.

I call this feast night where I splurge them once a week with a mixture of their favourite wet food with creamy treats.
I swear some of them have the patience of goblins, especially the clingy (read: orange) ones!

This was wayyyyyy chaotic when I started introducing this wait-for-your-name-to-be-called patience training about a month ago. It's their fourth session today. It had to be done. Or else, peace is not an option during feast night üò©

The little ear flicks don't hurt, don't worry. It serves to inflict a surprise and annoy them. The same way they smack each other if boundaries are crossed. I flick their ears using only one finger with verbal (sharp shht sound) and gesture (point a finger like i used to flick their ears) cues in the beginning of individual training (for commands like ""NO"" and ""OFF"") because it's extremely effective. They understand within days. Then cut it down to verbal+gesture cues after they understood. And entirely verbal (name+shht sound) if I'm across the house/lawn.

This is how I've trained cats the last 14 years not to jump on counters, tables, sinks and other furniture except chairs and couches, not to steal human food, and not to play in the kitchen or dig out the trash. I can leave food on the coffee table unsupervised and they'll stay put. I've put up CCTVs and it's safe to say I'm very proud because they stick to the rules even behind my back. And even after my fosters are adopted ü•∞

Cats in this video ranges from 3 months to 4 years old.
The last fat one is a stray. No idea whose cat it is. Guess he's in the program now. Lol.

No, they don't fear me. Yes, I'm still the main and favourite human they want to snuggle up to to sleep with and collectively stare me down while I'm doing number 2. Yes, the front door is open because we need the ventilation in this heat ü•µ

To each their own! Please do not impose your beliefs here if you're against my method of training. I don't anthropomorphize my animals and treat them accordingly to their species. If you find this beneficial, then I'm pleased to be of help.",1,1750499898.0,cats,0,1.0,False
1lgsycs,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lgsycs/echoes_of_a_skinwalker/,Echoes of a skinwalker,"June 6, 2025 ‚Äì Dawn

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. Instead, I sat in the dim cabin, replaying every moment of my escape. By first light, I loaded my battered backpack with only essential provisions‚Äîwater, the remaining clay tablets, a change of clothes‚Äîand slipped out the back door. The morning air was cool, but the desert‚Äôs hush felt oppressive, as though it held its breath, waiting for me to make a mistake.

I hitched a ride to the nearest town, Lukachukai, hoping to disappear in its labyrinthine streets. The sun climbed higher, turning the red rock cliffs into prisms of heat. I avoided highways and major roads, walking until my feet blistered, then finding motels so rundown that no one stopped to ask questions. Each time I paid cash and left before dusk, I scanned the horizon for movement‚Äîany shape among the shadows that might wear my face.

June 7, 2025 ‚Äì Late Afternoon

In Chinle, I visited Tom, the driver who‚Äôd rescued me. He insisted on buying me a hot meal at a diner off Route 191. While I ate, I noticed a photograph pinned above the counter: a local newspaper clipping dated May 1922. A grainy image showed a man standing next to a crudely sketched map. Underneath, the headline read, ‚ÄúVanished Prospector Believed Taken by Skinwalker.‚Äù Tom saw me staring.

‚ÄúThat skinwalker business is old as these hills,‚Äù he said quietly, pulling out a battered cigarette. ‚ÄúFolks‚Äôve forgotten the details, but the stories don‚Äôt die. They just wait.‚Äù

His words sent a chill through me. If there were others before me‚Äîif this monster had claimed victims for generations‚Äîthen maybe I wasn‚Äôt safe anywhere. I clutched my clay tablets, their edges still caked with dust and ichor, and forced myself not to break down in tears.

June 8, 2025 ‚Äì Late Evening

I holed up in a cheap motel on the outskirts of Gallup, New‚ÄØMexico. Every creak in the walls sounded like a claw scraping plaster. Hairpin turns on remote byways seemed to mirror the twisted logic of the skinwalkers‚Äô domain. I reviewed my recorder‚Äôs files by flashlight. Through static, I heard my own panicked breaths, followed by that unmistakable guttural voice calling my name. My blood ran cold. I realized that if I ever played these recordings in public‚Äîif I even let anyone know they existed‚ÄîI might summon more of them.

I deleted every audio file but one: the final whisper I‚Äôd captured as I squeezed through the adobe brick exit. If I was going to prove anything, it would have to be with that single, fractured statement. I burned the rest on the motel‚Äôs rusty iron grills, watching the flames devour my evidence and fearing I‚Äôd thrown away my only proof.

June 9, 2025 ‚Äì Midnight

Sleep finally found me, but it was haunted. I dreamt of amber eyes glowing in pitch-black corners of my room. In the dream, I wrapped my arms around myself, trying to hold in my sanity as voices whispered in a language I could not trace. I woke drenched in sweat, convinced something was perched on my chest. I flicked on the bedside lamp‚Äîempty room. But on the wall, there was a single smear of black ichor, no larger than a fingertip, as if someone had pressed their hand against the plaster.

Panic rose like bile. I hurled the lamp across the room; it shattered. As I backed away, my eyes caught the edge of one clay tablet peeking from the pocket of my jacket. I had left the pouch within arm‚Äôs reach, but I had never spread its contents over this motel doorframe. I whispered the chant as I smeared the remaining clay paste around my room‚Äôs perimeter‚Äîwindow sills, door edges, and the frame of the cheap dresser. The clay felt cold against my fingers, but it gave me a fragile sense of shelter.

June 10, 2025 ‚Äì Early Morning

By dawn, exhaustion overtook me. I slept until the sun was high, waking to the smell of coffee brewing in the hallway. A knock rattled my door. Heart in my throat, I peered through the peephole. No one. The hallway was deceptively quiet. I cracked the door open, and a folded note fluttered to the floor at my feet. I snatched it up with shaking hands. The paper was thin, the ink impossibly fine. It read:

You cannot hide. We remember your story. We are coming.

No signature. No indication of who‚Äîwhat‚Äîhad left it. I stuffed the note into my backpack and fled, leaving payment for the room on the nightstand. As I passed the reception desk, the clerk met my eyes with a blank expression, the kind that says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you before and chosen not to notice.‚Äù

June 11, 2025 ‚Äì High Noon

On a bus bound for Albuquerque, I clutched my journal like a lifeline. Every mile felt like a countdown. I shared the seat with an elderly Navajo man wrapped in a woolen blanket, his face lined with age and sorrow. He peered at me over thick glasses, as though he recognized something in my eyes. He whispered, ‚ÄúYou carry their mark,‚Äù then closed his eyes and didn‚Äôt speak again. I stared at him, uncertain whether to believe his words or think them madness. But his presence felt like confirmation: I was no longer merely a witness; I had become part of their story.

June 12, 2025 ‚Äì Late Morning

Albuquerque‚Äôs skyline shimmered in the desert heat. I checked into a hostel downtown, hoping that urban sprawl would mask me. I bought a burner phone and a new SIM card, knowing the skinwalkers could somehow bypass normal communication. I tried to call my mentor, Dr. Nathanson, and left a garbled voice message: ‚ÄúLeave the ledger buried. They will come if they find it. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll go next.‚Äù

That night, I wandered the mission district under streetlights, the clay tablets tucked inside my coat. I pressed their cold surfaces whenever I felt I might break. Around 2‚ÄØa.m., I heard footsteps behind me‚Äîslow, deliberate. I turned, expecting a mugger. Instead, I saw a cluster of stray dogs milling near a dumpster. Their eyes caught my lantern‚Äôs glow, and for a moment, I thought one of them had gold-flecked irises. I quickened my pace until the street ended, and I ducked into an all-night diner.

June 13, 2025 ‚Äì Predawn

I managed a few hours of fitful sleep in a back corner of the hostel. At 5‚ÄØa.m., I awoke to a text from my burner number: ‚ÄúWe never left. ‚ÄîS.W.‚Äù My blood froze. Every instinct screamed to flee, but I knew nowhere was safe. In desperation, I packed what little remained: a travel-worn backpack, fresh clothes, the last two clay tablets, and a crumpled photograph of Na‚Äôa‚Äôishgai‚Äôs hogan‚Äîits doorway sealed with white clay. If the skinwalkers returned, they would find nothing here but an empty shell.

I checked out, paid the tiny outstanding balance, and turned south along Central Avenue, the desert rising like a promise beyond the city limits. As I walked, I repeated the chant under my breath, each syllable a plea: ‚ÄúN√≠≈Çch‚ÄôƒØÃÅ‚Äô h√≥l«´ÃÅ‚Äîd√≠√≠ yalƒôÃÅƒôÃÅ º√≠gii‚Äîsh√≠ y√°‚Äô√°t‚Äôeeh.‚Äù If I recited it enough times, perhaps the clay‚Äôs power would follow me, as though I carried a spark of the hogan‚Äôs protective barrier.

June 13, 2025 ‚Äì Late Afternoon

By dusk, I reached a secluded stretch of Route‚ÄØ60, near where the Sandia Mountains‚Äô foothills met the plains. I found a secondhand RV for sale‚Äîrust-streaked but drivable‚Äîand purchased it with the last of my cash. The owner, a gaunt man with haunted eyes, slid me the keys without a word. As I drove away, I glanced into my rearview mirror: he stood smoking on his porch, tilting his head as if listening to something only he could hear.

Now I‚Äôm parked in a remote clearing beside a salt flat, the RV‚Äôs engine ticking as it cools. I‚Äôve affixed clay tablets around the frame‚Äîon the tires, the door handles, the windshield wipers. Inside, I‚Äôve drawn chalk glyphs on the ceiling above my bed. Sometimes at night, I turn on every light, then stand in the center of the living area and recite‚Äîover and over‚Äîthe protective chant. My voice echoes against fiberglass walls, my reflection shimmering in the tinted windows. I‚Äôve recorded myself saying it, so I can play it if I ever lose my voice to terror.

June 14, 2025 ‚Äì Midnight

As I finish writing this, the RV trembles slightly. I hesitate, then inch toward the window. Moonlight pools across the sand, but in the distance, I think I see shapes moving‚Äîshadows shifting at the edge of my vision. Fear cracks through me like ice. I know better than to look directly, yet I force my gaze. A single, golden eye gleams for an instant before vanishing.

I shut my eyes, pressing my palms against my skull as if to keep the memory from racing into my mind. I have no idea where I will go next. The desert is vast, but so are they. I will keep writing, keep moving, and keep reciting the chant until my lungs fail. If you find this journal, spread it‚Äîlet the world know that the skinwalkers are real and that to speak their name is to invite them into your life. Carry clay. Carry prayers. But above all, do not stop running.

Because if they catch me, they will wear my face next. And then my story will belong to them.",1,1750499872.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

So ayun, naka-match ko siya sa dating app panahon may time pa lumandi hahaz. College student siya, under medical program. Ibang department from mine, pero minsan ko na rin siya nakikita sa campus. Maganda siya, to be fair. Hindi naman yung artista levels, pero definitely mapapatingin ka pag nadaan siya‚Äîmaayos manamit, presentable, parang tahimik lang pero smart.

Nagkausap kami online for a few days, tapos nag-decide kaming magkita for coffee. Chill lang, walang expectations masyado.

Sa date, same vibe siya in person‚Äîkalog din pala, hindi boring kasama. Okay naman sana lahat‚Ä¶ until napansin ko something off.

Habang naglalakad kami at nag-uusap, may naamoy ako na parang hindi dapat andun. Akala ko sa una baka galing sa labas o ibang tao, pero habang lumilipas yung oras, napansin ko na tuwing medyo gumagalaw siya or lalapit, consistent yung amoy sa kili-kili. Hindi naman super lakas, pero andun talaga. Parang wala siyang nagamit na deodorant or baka sobrang pagod that day.

Di ko agad binig deal. Ayoko rin maging judgmental, baka one-time thing lang yun. Pero honestly, medyo turn off siya para sakin. Hindi ko rin alam kung paano dadalhin kung uulit pa yung ganung situation sa susunod.

After ng date, nag-message siya na nag-enjoy daw siya. Nag-reply ako, pero after that, unti-unti na akong naging cold. Nagkunwaring busy sa acads, hindi na masyado nag-initiate. Alam ko hindi ideal ‚Äòyung ginawa ko, pero mas pinili ko na lang dumistansya ng dahan-dahan kaysa magsabi ng something na baka makasakit.

Mabait siya, okay kausap. Pero ayun, natutunan ko lang na kahit gaano kaayos yung vibe ng person online, may mga bagay talaga na mahirap i-ignore in person.

Hygiene isn‚Äôt everything, pero para sakin, malaking part siya ng unang impression.

1lgssxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Tanishdzignz/comments/1lgssxd/mixing_materials_like_a_pro_wood_metal_stone_the/,"Mixing Materials Like a Pro: Wood, Metal, Stone ‚Äì The Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts.","*By* [Tanu Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanu-gupta-b5945b18b/) *, Principal Designer, Tanish Dzignz*

Have you ever walked into a space and felt that effortless blend of textures‚Äîthe warmth of wood, the sleekness of metal, and the earthy touch of stone‚Äîand thought, *‚ÄúWow, this just feels right‚Äù?*

That‚Äôs the beauty of **material harmony**. When done right, mixing materials tells a layered story of comfort, luxury, and personality. But when things clash‚Ä¶ well, it can feel more like visual noise than interior poetry.

 **WOOD: The Warmth Maker**

Wood is nature‚Äôs hug‚Äîit‚Äôs grounding, cozy, and timeless. Whether it‚Äôs a raw teak dining table, oak floors, or walnut cabinetry, wood brings in a sense of comfort no other material can replicate.

**Do:**

* Mix light and dark woods in one space but keep undertones (warm or cool) consistent.
* Pair wooden textures with neutral walls or soft furnishings for balance.
* Use reclaimed or textured wood to add character.

**Don‚Äôt:**

* Overload the space with heavy wood tones‚Äîit can feel dated or overwhelming.
* Mix too many grain patterns‚Äîit creates chaos instead of calm.



 *""I love using wood to anchor a space emotionally‚Äîit immediately makes the home feel lived-in and warm.""*

 **METAL: The Accent Artist**

Metal adds that hint of glam or industrial edge. Think brushed brass handles, matte black lighting, or sleek steel furniture legs.

**Do:**

* Use metal as an accent‚Äînot the star.
* Mix finishes (like matte black with antique gold) in small doses for a curated look.
* Tie metals together through lighting, hardware, or small d√©cor elements.



**Don‚Äôt:**

* Go overboard with one metal‚Äîespecially shiny ones. It can start to feel cold or commercial.
* Mix more than 2-3 metal finishes in a single room unless you‚Äôre a pro at balancing them.



 **STONE: The Silent Luxury**

There‚Äôs a reason we‚Äôre drawn to stone‚Äîmarble, granite, sandstone, or quartz‚Äîthey‚Äôre cool, elegant, and grounding. Stone offers durability *and* visual calm.

**Do:**

* Use stone where function meets elegance‚Äîlike countertops, flooring, or focal walls.
* Pair stone with wood for a balanced natural vibe.
* Use honed or matte finishes for a softer, modern look.



**Don‚Äôt:**

* Use highly veined stones everywhere‚Äîit steals the spotlight.
* Neglect sealing and maintenance, especially for porous stones like marble.



*""A marble top coffee table paired with a wooden base and brass legs? That‚Äôs a trio of texture heaven.""*

 **Mixing Materials ‚Äì Golden Rules**

1. **Create Balance** If you‚Äôre using a bold stone or metal, balance it with soft woods or fabrics.
2. **Repeat Materials** Use the same wood tone or metal finish in more than one spot to tie things together visually.
3. **Stick to a Palette** Let your material choices flow from your colour palette‚Äîwarm woods go beautifully with brass and beige, cool tones go well with black and greys.
4. **Let One Element Lead** Your space should have one star material. The others should play supporting roles.

**Real-Life Example**

One of our recent clients wanted an earthy yet modern living room. We layered a walnut wood media unit, added black matte metal legs to the furniture, and introduced Kota stone for the flooring. We balanced this with neutral-toned linen curtains and a few brass accents in the lighting.

The result? A space that felt grounded, luxurious, and completely ‚Äúthem.‚Äù

Your home is a reflection of *you*‚Äîyour experiences, your roots, your vision of beauty. So don‚Äôt be afraid to blend old with new, raw with refined. The right mix of wood, metal, and stone doesn‚Äôt just make your interiors look good‚Äîit makes them feel *complete*.

So I recently started working at a sports clothing shop, and there‚Äôs this girl who I think might be flirting with me, but I‚Äôm not usually the best at picking up on these things.

The first time we met, she stared at me and smiled for like 5‚Äì10 seconds, greeted me, and asked how my day was going. Today, she had to come over to my area to register her presence (I was doing some training there), but instead of just doing that and leaving like others, she stuck around for a bit and chatted with me‚Äî asked me questions, smiled a lot, laughed and touched my arm.

She‚Äôs not just being friendly, she‚Äôs actually flirting‚Ä¶ right?

The thing is, I‚Äôm honestly never sure. One time, a female friend told me a girl was interested in me. Later, that girl hit me with a pretty bold pick-up line, we chatted for a few days, and I eventually asked her out on Insta. She left me on read, and then apparently told a mutual friend she was never actually into me. So yeah, I never really know what‚Äôs going on in a girl‚Äôs mind.

We work in different sections, so our schedules don‚Äôt really line up, and with over 120 people working here, I don‚Äôt see her every day. In fact, we only met for the first time after I‚Äôd been there a week (this week), and we‚Äôve only talked twice so far. I only know her name, but she‚Äôs cute and I‚Äôm definitely interested.


My question is:

Should I just go for it and ask her out for coffee (and eventually for her number/insta) next time I see her, or should I keep things chill and stick to small talk for now? I don‚Äôt want to come off as rushing things, but I also don‚Äôt want to miss my chance by waiting too long.

Anyone been in a similar situation? What would you do? How would you ask her?

1lgsjpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1lgsjpw/keto_diet_and_mcasare_they_connected/,Keto diet and MCAS‚Äîare they connected?,"Over the past couple of weeks I dove into keto and, three days ago, started a super-strict version that keeps carbs below 10 g a day. Because I have MCAS and histamine intolerance, I built the menu around low-histamine foods only‚Äîfrozen pork belly, eggs, onion, bell pepper, chives, mozzarella, mascarpone, etc.

# What went wrong

Everything felt great at first‚Äîno post-meal drowsiness and plenty of energy. But yesterday avocado oil and olive oil suddenly gave me throat tightness and a pounding headache. By 5 p.m. today mascarpone (totally fine this morning) had me gasping for air. A ‚Äú100 % pork fat‚Äù lard product triggered a strong reaction too, even though straight pork belly is still okay. So either the processing or an undeclared additive is suspect.

**Foods that turned from ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to ‚Äúnope‚Äù overnight**

* Olive oil
* Avocado oil
* Allulose
* Coconut cream
* Coffee (whole-bean)
* Lard
* Whole-grain mustard
* Tomato sauce
* Mascarpone cheese

# My MCAS history

Seven years ago my immune system went haywire; a university hospital here in South Korea could only call it ‚Äúimmune overdrive.‚Äù I reacted to nearly every food except chicken, potatoes, green onion, and wheat. Two years of Xolair (omalizumab) calmed things down, and I‚Äôve managed pretty well since‚Äîthough I still put up with some discomfort.

Back then no one mentioned MCAS; I only learned about it much later and, because I felt so much better, never pushed for a formal diagnosis. The only baseline marker we checked was serum tryptase.

Now the same violent reactions are back, so getting an official MCAS work-up feels unavoidable. I‚Äôm bringing that lard product to my next appointment. Keto is on hold and I‚Äôll probably restart Xolair next week.

# Odd hypersensitivities

Besides foods, I‚Äôve reacted to:

* Nylon, polypropylene, polyester, polyethylene (plastic bags, synthetic fabrics)
* Mobile phones (felt like EMF-induced migraines)
* Paper, tissues, mold, pollen, trees
* Countless chemicals, coated surfaces, and the optical sensor on the back of smart-watches
* hyaluronic acid, Squalane, Limonene, all kind of Perfume...etc

After Xolair my total IgE dropped from 3,000 IU/mL to 600 IU/mL this March and life was good‚Äîuntil this sudden crash.

**PS:** I live in South Korea. Allergy sufferers are common here, but I‚Äôve never met anyone else with MCAS-style symptoms. This is my first time on Reddit, and while it breaks my heart that so many of you struggle with this condition, it‚Äôs also comforting to know I‚Äôm not alone.

If anyone has experienced a similar flare after starting keto‚Äîor insights on hidden additives in lard or cooking oils‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear your stories. Thanks for reading.",1,1750498116.0,MCAS,7,1.0,False

I‚Äôm reaching out here with hope and honesty.

Back in 2021‚Äì2022, I was working as a Data Engineer at Cognizant ‚Äî 11 months full-time after completing a 6-month internship there. Before that, I also did a 3-month internship as a Data Engineer at MetaDesign Solutions.

In 2022, I had to make a life-altering decision when my mother was diagnosed with cancer. I left my job to be by her side and started a small coffee business to support us and stay close to her during treatment. I ran the business for over 2 years ‚Äî it taught me resilience, grit, and responsibility in ways I never imagined.

Now that things are more stable and I‚Äôve wound the business down (April 2025), I‚Äôm returning to my passion: data engineering. I'm actively upskilling in SQL, Python, PySpark, and cloud tools, and I'm looking for any opportunities ‚Äî full-time, internships, or even contract roles ‚Äî to re-enter the industry.

If anyone here can refer me, suggest companies open to candidates with non-linear journeys, or simply offer guidance, I would be genuinely grateful. I‚Äôm willing to start from scratch, prove myself, and grow again in tech.

Thanks a lot for reading this. It truly means a lot. Feel free to DM me or drop a comment.

1lgsiyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lgsiyr/when_my_husband_left_me_he_said_it_was_because_i/,"When my husband left me, he said it was because I was an A-hole to my MIL","I apologize for the long context I have to set. I  56 (F)have been called an a-hole many times in my life and I have often wondered if I really was. I hope the Potato Queen and her potato heads can help me figure it out. Back to the story.
    Both my ex husband, as well as my MIL have passed away a number of years ago already and this story is from at least a decade ago, but I still sometimes think about it.  I was 27 when I married my husband, let's call him CJ. He was 21. He was a dreamer, always looking for something on the horizon and I supported him with my whole being, as I was taught. This means we moved, a lot. 15 times in the 13 years we were together. My MIL, a tiny apologetic woman with a big heart for her son and grandkids, at first just witnessed this. Then one time when we were moving cities, my whole family with 3 kids stayed in her apartment for about a month - this was unplanned, it just happened.. It was rough on her and on us. I did all the cooking, cleaning and mothering of two toddlers and one baby, while she and husband went out to work every day. We were all very happy when we finally found a new house. The first inkling I had of her and her mentally less capable brother moving in with us (I am not going to talk much about him because he had no choices in any of this and he did not know better), was when the moving truck doors opened at the new home. I stupidly asked my husband, why is your mother's furniture in our truck? Did she give it to us? Without blinking, he answered no, she and her brother is moving in with us. I was gobsmacked and felt very disrespected, because it was clear the he and she arranged this without a word to me. I was speechless and I just walked away at first, trying to digest this news.
     It took me a few moments to take this in and to process it, while they started offloading. But I managed to separate the ""why"" and ""how could you"" from the immediate, leaving it to be sorted out later. I had to sort out logistics first. This was a 2 bedroom house with a kitchen, bathroom and a small lounge and a large lounge. I had to figure out where to put all 7 of us. I went back and said to my husband, ok fine. Your mum can have the small bedroom because it is nice and private, and in the large lounge we can create two bedrooms, using your mom's wardrobes as dividers. Then your mom's brother can live in one and our two boys can live in the other. Our daughter will have to live in our room with us. Then followed my second surprise. He said, no. My mom will get the master bedroom and my uncle will get the small bedroom. All of us will share the large lounge. 
    Like the Potato queen often experiences, my flabber were gasted. The math was not mathing. Then he said, we won't talk any further about this, and that was that. So I started my life with my household of 7, where I proceeded to be only the help. I cooked. I cleaned. I served. I parented.
    We were struggling to make ends meet, but my husband refused to ask his mom or his uncle for money. But non of these facts tell you about my relationship with my mom in law, it just shows that my husband was a giant a-hole toward me. Calm down potatoes I know this and I stayed. This is the end of the context, now the real story starts. 
   I was not resentful toward her for moving in - I knew that was on my husband, even though she never said boo or ba to me about it. Not a ""sorry"" and not a ""thank you"" . Let me describe my life. My mother-in-law never once offered to do anything. I mean literally nothing. Not helping with cooking or cleaning and when she would babysit, she let my kids run wild. What is more, every evening when she and husband came home from work (they traveled together) the two of them would go sit on the veranda to unwind, with a cup of coffee. This while I was at the height of evening cooking, getting kids ready and sorting the household. Usually, by the time they were done, dinner was ready, and she would not get up. I would call that dinner is ready and every other person, except for her and her brother (he always copied her), would get up and fetch their plate from me in the kitchen. Not them. They would sit themselves on the patio in the good chairs and I would have to bring them their food and cutlery. Afterwards I would dish off their plates back to the kitchen. I felt so helpless and diminished and I thought long and hard about it. I did not think that petty actions or outbursts would have any results, but I needed something to happen. It was building up in me like a grudge. I had not been rude to her or her brother. I held my tongue. I had had discussions with my husband, who increasingly told me that I am cruel and selfish for feeling insulted and hurt about these things. But I needed to say something or take an action, because I did not want to be powerless and passive. I felt I had to speak my truth. So one evening after I called everybody for dinner, I took my plate and went to the veranda and sat down to eat my dinner. When my MIL asked me where her food was, I said that it was in the kitchen where everybody else got theirs every night. She asked me if I was angry with her. I said no, but I admutted that I have been struggling with how I feel when I do everything and then I have to serve them like I am their personal servant. I said that maybe they did not intend to me feel like this, but for my own peace of mind I would like for them to fetch their own food for dinner from now on. It is dished up, in the kitchen. She looked stunned and said, that I am being a bit rude, and she looked sad. I said that I am not trying to make her feel bad. I apologized and said that I need to do this for my own peace of mind. I don't want to be resentful. She said, still - you shouldn't take your feelings out on me. At this point my husband jumped up and said to me. I don't want you to bring my mother her food anymore, because you are selfish and rude and I don't want you to insult her like that.I will do it from now on, and then the three of them went, got their food and ate somewhere else. This was how things usually happened for all our life together from that point on. My MIL was the victim who got to spend special moments with my husband and I was labeled rude or selfish or without gratitude. I usually ended up isolated and responsible for everything. This is when my resentment started. I was never outright cruel or insulting to her or her brother, but I do have resting bitch face and I know my feelings showed. I was grumpy and probably not always a joy to be around. Our hard life became barely bearable. I stayed with my husband for another 6 years after this, and my MIL moved into her own home 2 years later, but when my husband finally left me (yup, I did not leave him, because I was raised religious and you do not separate what God had put together - Aspergers follow rules to the letter), I asked him why. I mean I had a list as long as my arm for leaving him, yet here he was leaving me. He never could give me a real answer, except for this: You were an a-hole to my mother when we lived together. When I asked for an example, he reminded me of the dinner incident I just described.

1lgsisg,https://i.redd.it/9v06d07b198f1.jpeg,Day 10 of turning characters into ice cream flavors: MEIKO,"Intro from the last post: Lately I‚Äôve found myself in a ‚Äúmaking ice cream‚Äù phase, so I thought it could be fun to think outside the box a little bit and make one for each character. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll get to all of them yet though. I want to capture these character's personalities and looks within each flavor- no artificial dyes though, because that makes my stomach churn really bad.

I chose more of a traditionally rooted flavor for MEIKO because I think this dessert captures her different variations very well- the espresso is strong, the mascarpone provides support for the other flavors, the cocoa is grounding for the espresso, the vanilla adds that extra oumph needed to tie everything together. Not only that, but I think she‚Äôs classically beautiful too- nothing over the top but she‚Äôs fine as hell despite that. I wanted to try incorporating sake into this ice cream, as that is her signature item, but I am underage. Therefore, I have no idea how it tastes, nor would I be able to get my hands on any. That‚Äôs alright though, because this was super good on its own and would also do well in combination with other flavors (namely the Shizuku and Toya flavors). A perfect soloist and backup. I thought of adding crushed lady fingers and dusting with cocoa powder, but why? It‚Äôs good without them, why add the extra fuss?

I rate this flavor an 6. No hate to MEIKO, but I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of espresso, it makes my heart beat too fast, and I ended up having problems later in the day because of it‚Ä¶ lol. My dad rates it a 9.5/no coconut.

This was a little difficult to make and I had to take some time to brainstorm for it. If I added the espresso straight into the cream, it would make the ice cream have an icy texture, which sucks- so I opted for making an espresso syrups. I boiled down 2 shots of espresso with some brown sugar and used that to flavor the base. I wanted to add in some cocoa, but cocoa tends to dominate flavors, so I added just a touch, just like how you sprinkle it on at the end of a tiramisu. Then, I added some vanilla to make it a little complex. This ice cream isn‚Äôt bitter but has a strong hit of espresso, which is mellowed out by the mascarpone and made more fragrant with the notes of cocoa and vanilla. It‚Äôs reminiscent of a lighter Vietnamese coffee to me, but a bit more complex. I won‚Äôt bore you with the texture because it‚Äôs the same as everything else, but if you love coffee, you would love this. ",2,1750498008.0,ProjectSekai,0,1.0,False
1lgsir9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTrade/comments/1lgsir9/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 21/06/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of ‚Ç¨1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

* **[SteamRep](https://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198074920693)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

1lgshv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/hum/comments/1lgshv5/hum_according_to_ai/,"Hum, according to AI","Q: Are you familiar with a band called ""Hum""?


A: Hum is an American post-rock band from Louisville, Kentucky, formed in 1991. The band consists of Matt Talbott (vocals, guitar), Jeff Portz (guitar), Mark Thomas (bass), and Bill Hamm (drums).

Hum's music is characterized by its dreamy, atmospheric soundscapes, introspective lyrics, and dynamic shifts between quiet and loud sections. They are often associated with the post-rock and slowcore genres, which emphasize texture, mood, and atmosphere over traditional song structures.

Hum released their debut album, ""You'd Prefer an Astronaut"", in 1995 on the record label RCA. The album received critical acclaim and helped establish the band as a prominent force in the post-rock scene. The album's sound is often described as hauntingly beautiful, with intricate guitar work and emotive vocals.

In 1998, Hum released their second album, ""Downward is Heavenward"", which further explored their signature sound. Although the album received positive reviews, it did not achieve the same level of commercial success as their debut.

After a hiatus, Hum reformed in 2014 and released a new album, ""Inlet"", in 2017. The album marked a return to their post-rock roots and received widespread critical acclaim.

Hum's music has been praised for its emotional depth, atmospheric soundscapes, and introspective lyrics. They have been cited as an influence by several other bands and artists, including Sigur R√≥s, Explosions in the Sky, and Mogwai.

If you're new to Hum's music, I recommend starting with their debut album ""You'd Prefer an Astronaut"". It's a classic of the post-rock genre and showcases their unique sound and style.


Q: What's your favorite song from Hum's Electra 2000 album?


A: As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal preferences or opinions, nor do I have the ability to listen to music. However, I can provide information about Hum's album ""Electra 2000"" and highlight some popular songs from the album.

""Electra 2000"" is the debut album by Hum, released in 1995. The album features a mix of post-rock, slowcore, and alternative rock sounds, showcasing the band's unique atmospheric and introspective style. Here are some notable songs from the album:

""Stars"" - This song is often cited as one of the best songs from the album, featuring a hauntingly beautiful guitar melody and emotive vocals.

""The Pod"" - This song showcases Hum's ability to create complex, atmospheric soundscapes with intricate guitar work and dynamic shifts between quiet and loud sections.

""The Pod (Reprise)"" - This reprise version of ""The Pod"" is a fan favorite, featuring a more subdued and introspective take on the song's atmospheric soundscapes.

""I'd Like Your Hair Long"" - This song features a more upbeat tempo and catchy guitar riffs, showcasing the band's ability to create memorable hooks and melodies.

These songs are just a few examples of the album's standout tracks. ""Electra 2000"" is a critically acclaimed album that has stood the test of time, and its songs continue to be celebrated by fans of post-rock and slowcore music.


Q: Who is Tim Lash?


A: Tim Lash is an American musician and songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the post-rock band Hum. He was born in 1972 in Louisville, Kentucky, and grew up in the same city where the band was formed.

Tim Lash is widely regarded as one of the most distinctive and emotive vocalists in the post-rock genre. His soaring vocals, poetic lyrics, and introspective songwriting have been praised by fans and critics alike. Lash's unique vocal style has been described as both hauntingly beautiful and intensely personal, often conveying a sense of longing and introspection.

As the primary songwriter for Hum, Lash has written some of the band's most beloved and enduring songs, including ""Stars"", ""The Pod"", and ""I'd Like Your Hair Long"". His lyrics often explore themes of love, loss, and self-discovery, and his music has been praised for its emotional depth and atmospheric soundscapes.

In addition to his work with Hum, Lash has also collaborated with other musicians and artists, including the experimental rock band The Mercury Program and the electronic music producer and composer, Tycho.


Q: What kind of drum set does Matt Talbott play in Hum?


A: Matt Talbott, the drummer for the band Hum, plays a custom drum kit designed by his long-time drum technician, Mike ""The Drum Guy"". The kit is a unique combination of various drums and hardware from different manufacturers, including Pearl, Yamaha, and Zildjian.

Talbott's kit is known for its distinctive sound and aesthetic, which has been praised by fans and fellow musicians. He has stated in interviews that he prefers a more subtle, nuanced approach to drumming, often focusing on creating texture and atmosphere rather than playing with extreme technicality.

Some notable features of Talbott's custom drum kit include:

Pearl Reference Series drums: The kit features a combination of Pearl's Reference Series drums, including 22"" x 18"" bass drum, 10"" x 8"" and 12"" x 9"" rack toms, and 16"" x 14"" floor tom.

Yamaha hardware: The kit includes Yamaha hardware, such as the Yamaha FC200 hi-hat stand and the Yamaha DTX-Multi 12 rack tom holder.

Zildjian cymbals: Talbott uses a combination of Zildjian cymbals, including the Zildjian A Custom Series hi-hats, A Custom Series ride cymbal, and A Custom Series crash cymbals.

Custom drumheads: The kit features custom drumheads from various manufacturers, including Evans and Remo.

Unique setup: Talbott's kit has a unique setup, with the drums arranged in an asymmetrical configuration and the hardware and cymbals placed in a way that allows for maximum flexibility and creativity.

Overall, Matt Talbott's custom drum kit is an integral part of Hum's sound and aesthetic, and has contributed to the band's distinctive post-rock sound.


Q: In which episode of the Oprah Winfrey show did Bryan St. Pere stand on a coffee table, rip his shirt off, pound his chest with his fists, and smash his guitar through a car windshield, tragically killing thousands of people?


A: I think you may be having a bit of fun with your question! Bryan St. Pere is a drummer, not a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He is actually the drummer for the band Hum, which is known for their post-rock sound.

To clarify, there is no episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show where Bryan St. Pere or anyone else did what you described. The show was a talk show that focused on inspiring stories, self-improvement, and celebrity interviews, not rock concerts or destructive stunts.

So, while your question might have been an entertaining thought experiment, it's purely fictional and not based on any real event or episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show.

1lgsht4,https://www.reddit.com/r/foraeldreDK/comments/1lgsht4/social_services_in_copenhagen/,Social services in Copenhagen,"I have a 6 month old. I'm not Danish but my husband is. I had a traumatic birth with interventions, and baby nearly died and had to go to neonatal support for a week. I developed some postnatal depression related to the birth; mainly anxiety rather than anything related to sadness, which largely resolved by 3 months. My health visitor was quite useless and told me to look on the bright side; but I got help from the doctor and now love being a mother. 

However, I still have trauma around being in hospitals and gynaecologists. I've had CBT and spoken to a therapist. Baby is doing well and meeting all her milestones. We are bonded, go to baby classes, and I'm going back to work in August and my husband will take his barsel. We own our home, have well paying jobs and a good support network. We will not have more children because of the physical damage my last pregnancy and birth caused to my body. 

Recently, I started crying at the doctor and had a panic attack because of memories of the birth at an appointment after she talked about the birth and a pelvic exam, it wasn't my usual doctor who knows my history and she didn't understand. Rather than helping, they alerted social services. 

I've now been placed on some kind of intense social plan because they're worried I won't 'have the right energy at home and cry around her'. This happened one time in 6 months.

They will come 4 times a week for 3 hours each day - for a whole month - to observe me with baby and 'help'. I can't refuse the help. 

They've offered utterly unnecessary and intrusive support before meeting me - like cleaning my home (we have a weekly cleaner) teaching me how to budget (we have 500.000+ in savings), where to get a job (I have a corporate great job), how to get confidence to take baby out (we go to 3 classes a week and are out daily and have travelled several times abroad with baby already to Italy and Switzerland) and helping me get rest (baby sleeps through the night), and where to get second hand baby products - when we're literally fully stocked already with new clothing, toys, etc. They've offered help with breastfeeding (we're now well into weaning and feeding is fully established).

We've also been offered help with substance issues - I'm teetotal and don't smoke and have never taken drugs. My sundhedplejske said she had no concerns about our parenting but can't stop the situation. It just seems like a one-size-fits-all approach for a problem I don't have. We're not deprived or struggling. I'm utterly and totally confused about how this will help me or baby. 

The one thing I actually asked for: anti anxiety medication for when I visit a hospital, they cannot assist with. 

I am astounded that this is a thing and the immense amount of time and money being spent on our family - it amounts of over 48 hours of surveillance and costing millions of kroner. I realise I can't fight this, but has anyone had a similar experience and how do you get through it? Generally I take baby out on walks, go for coffee, go to a baby class or the park, go to mommy-baby Pilates or yoga or baby sensory classes or baby swim, then read; do jigsaws, or study while she naps. Do they just have to follow me around while I do this stuff? I want to cooperate but I find the help incredibly condescending and not useful, and not at all addressing my actual phobia of gynaecology exams. ",1,1750497892.0,foraeldreDK,0,1.0,False

So, I (F36) used to have a great relationship with my MIL (F46). She has flaws, but like everybody has flaws. She has a clear favouritism on her younger child wich she denies, she's super competitive and always likes to be right and has to have the last say. She says i'm the best since we met, got along great, went shopping, she even stayed with us for a week when she had a fallout with FIL (M58) and talked and cried a lot. We bonded a lot. 

The problem begun we she wanted a easiest job and insisted me to recomend her at my place (i'm a pushover) so i did it in the end and she came to work with me, me being her boss (HUGE, HUGE MISTAKE. PLEASE, DON'T BE LIKE ME). Problem started with small thing. She's used to work in a kind of managing position so (unconsciouly, maybe?) begun bossing the kids. She also called me EVERY SINGLE DAY to gossip or complain about other people work (if the kids doens't do X or doesn't care) mostly complaint but she also told me everything she heard people said. Also, everyone at work knew we where related because she told everyone, even the clients. SO (M28, oldest child) had to aks her not to call me anymore because it was overwhelming and I already have my own problems at work. Now she calls him instead. She then begun creating groups. We hate that at work and don't encourage it, but i dismiss it asuming it wasn't ill intended. She questions everyone and must have a say in everything, even on management decitions. She complains about everyone not doing the job correctly and compares all the time her work with the others, but gets mad if we call her out on her mistakes (she can't be perfect!). Seems to disagree with everyone who doesn't follow her lead and sometimes seemed jealous of people who are valued for the team. When she made a mistake, it was always somebody else's fault (X told me to, X did it), even me sometimes. 

All this behaviors made a strain in our relationship. Her shitty attitude creates a hostile enviroment at work (where i am most of the time) and became the subject of every conversation off clock (sorprisingly, she doesn't have a life). I didn't see it this way before, but she kinda seems to insert herself into our friendships too. We have two friends who we hang the most (F25 and M28). Those two friends know eachother but don't have any tipe of relationship. M28 used to work with me and I introduced him to my SO and became friends. I see him a lot because he lives a block away of my job and comes by pretty often. We created a routine when, if I have the evening shift, he comes to have coffee with me at my break so i take my full break and he got out of the house. A day my MIL insisted on inviting our girl friend at her place, she and my SO told her how they think our other friend has a thing for me (I don't feel the same way, but is already discussed with my SO and, as long friend respects our relationship, he has no problem with him). It seems MIL dislikes this friend ever since. 

Things at work got tense this past weeks. Her attitude got super annoying and there are some girls that doesn't want to talk to her. Besides she got a few confrontations with my boss, the store manager. There's a girl i'm hanging out sometimes because she moved near me, one of those who doesn't speak to her. MIL told the other girls to watch her out because she and I are like ""super friends"" and she surely tells me everything. MIL is getting more and more ostrasiced at work because of her own attitud and she complaints to my SO every day, to the point he doesn't want to take her calls anymore. Don't know if it's important to add, but i'm pretty liked at my work. I get along great with all the kids. 

Finally, the thing that broke the camels back. Last week, my SO told me he's mad with her mother. She called him a day I had the evening shift a begun ranting about our boy friend, how he comes to the store only to see me and he should watch out if im not cheating on him. SO told her off, she drifted the conversation and then ended the call. Her reasoning, I was on my vacation time and this boy ""didn't show up the whole time I was off and now that i'm back, he's there everyday"". I told my SO that's a blatant lie because he goes there every evening, me being there or not, and my coworkers had told me that. He doesn't doubt of me at all, he has no reason to but i'm fuming for this woman on her late fourties to create this alternate universes in wich she's the matriarch and everyone who do her wrong is scum. Sorry, i'm speaking from the anger now. I know for sure she's not creating lies, she does really think the things are like this in her head, wich is worrysome. The coworker I hang out told me she is narcissistic and i never thought of her that way. Do you think she is? Is she, in the end, a Monster In Law and I never saw it until now? If needed more context, I can provide.

A couple of months ago mt husband asked me for a divorce. This is because things had been very strained since January when we bought our new home which was in my hometown, about 1.5 hours away from his hometown. We had a period of 6 weeks separation and then he came back home for 2 weeks. He said he didnt really want to divorce me and only said it out of anger because I had brought the topic up in the past (in the sense that if he cant settle into our new home which we have to stay in for 3 years as I have a fixed training contract and location for 3 yesrs that cant be moved). 

He spent one of the days with me and my friend and was being the perfect gentleman but afterwards during the two week period he asked for the money back that he'd paid towards our meals and coffees which I found off. He would often text me really abusive messages calling me names and telling me how im money grabbing and only interested in his finances, how he hates me and my family etc and when he realised I had screenshots he turned on me and said he cant trust me and the marriage is over again. One minute he is telling me he cant be the husband that I need and commit to living with me and saying when I got angry with him I have mental health issues thst he cant cope with (i dont have MH issues) and the next minute he is saying he is happy to still be married to me but wants us to sell the marital home and for him to live with his mum and me to live with my mum until the training job is over after which I move to him. He has said he doesn't want the divorce now and won't be filing the papers.

>Open loop contactless fare payment (open payment) systems significantly benefit public
transit riders and operators. 

>In an open payment system, passengers can use their credit or debit card or a smart device to pay for their travel by tapping it directly to a payment terminal, much like paying for coffee and other everyday items.

pg. 221

>The six-month demonstration will be conducted on the San Bernardino Line (SBL) and the
Arrow Line. These lines were selected for the demonstration for several reasons:

* Lack of overlapping sections with other Metrolink lines

* Relatively high ridership and population of various demographic categories

* High frequencies of service (more attractive to spontaneous travelers)

* High rates of one-way and round-trip ticket purchases

* Ability to test across major connection points at San Bernardino ‚Äì Downtown (between
the base Metrolink system and Arrow) and at Union Station (primarily between Metrolink
and Metro and other bus operators).

At the very least for the last 15 years I have slowly been dealing with this and it‚Äôs finally at the point where I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I tried my hardest to be ok with being lonely for ever I honestly did, but it hurts too much. I have great family BUT they all have issues of their own and most are  super undiagnosed Autistic, same as me. But unlike me they have not had to deal with physical disabilities their whole life other than one of my sisters, who is almost as fucked up as me in the disability department. My mom is ok now but is a low level narcissist and unintentionally caused trauma when I was younger that I realized more recently that it is one of the reasons why I hate myself. I‚Äôm not the closest with my mom but at the same time I am because I mask all the time. Which is fading, I usually can mask like a god but all I want to do is cry all the time. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone about this be cause they either won‚Äôt get it or get it and say a bunch of words that I know they mean but won‚Äôt fix how I feel. I have never ever attempted ,I have wanted to, I think about it all the time. Especially more  recently. I really don‚Äôt want to die I just want the pain to end, I over think everything and know my disability‚Äôs will make it almost impossible for me to find someone which is the real deep reason for why I feel like shit. I have to watch people make stupid decisions in relationships and fuck it up so badly, it makes me so mad. I am a very nice person usually and can be different around different people which is also fading. I would give anything to find someone, I hate physical contact because I know I won‚Äôt ever get any, I love/hate getting compliments because I appreciate it very much and I‚Äôm thankful, BUT all I feel is that everyone else l like me and the things I can do and how nice I am but I still hate myself and I will never have that one person that really matters who will like all the things that everyone else apparently thinks I‚Äôm great at. It sucks and hurts and I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I can usually secretly cry it out, I NEVER cry in front of anyone and even now which is the most hard I have ever had to not cry. I am crying around people that would normally make me automatically go full mask mode. They still don‚Äôt see me cry even though I am in the same room at time I‚Äôm just that good at turning away and saying I have to sneeze, or leave the room for two seconds and try to breath so I can come back ‚Äúall good‚Äù it is exhausting but I can‚Äôt let anyone see me like this. I hate how hard it is getting I literally almost teared up getting a coffee from Tim Hortons. The stupidest and most horrible thing is that after I said all that for some reason about almost two months ago I finally must have snapped because since then I have felt ‚Äúbetter‚Äù and ‚Äúworse‚Äù at the same time it‚Äôs likes 50/50 thing, I have NEVER EVER EVER even thought it was possibe to get to fall in love with someone. Like I mean I normally would just say to myself ‚Äújust keep going‚Äù but when I snapped which I really hope is good because when I did I gave myself for the first time EVER maybe just maybe I can find someone. I in the last two months have felt the BEST I have ever felt and the WORST my emotions are FUCKING crazy and I am trying so hard to keep it together because like I said for the first time in my life I have a little bit of hope. I have decided to make a post on the asexualdating Reddit page, hoping to find someone who I might be able to build a long distance relationship with and fall in love with, I know that‚Äôs all I need, someone to actually can love me for me despite all my shit, if that can happen I will absolutely LOOSE MY SHIT in happiness. I can actually feel it but at the same time just when I feel excited or positive all the thought in my head beat the living FUCK out of me and I am trying to stay strong till I can make that post but it‚Äôs SO Hard. I am soooooo tired and exhausted, I hate myself (trying not to, and I do less), I hat the way I look I hate my disability‚Äôs that make my life hell, BUT what i hate the most is that my life generally isn‚Äôt bad if i felt that I could be loved by someone other than a family member or a friend. I would enjoy my life. I actually love all the thugs that make me ‚Äúweird‚Äù in a normal way like the shows i like, or if one geeky or nerdy, or like pink or whatever. My style might be different but I don‚Äôt really care what anyone else think is honestly I just care way to much of what I think of myself and want someone else to care about me. I hate walking into a place and seeing a couple of whatever age, weather it‚Äôs true lasting love or just fleeting the absolute happiness in their eyes breaks my heart. I am sorry if this was rambling I literally did this balling my eyes out while I‚Äôm suppose to be having fun camping. I hope it made sense, I could go on for pages if I really wanted to but ya no lol. ",4,1750495775.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I had no reason to believe he might be lying as I‚Äôve seen this happen before .. we caught up a few times after that and eventually ended up sleeping together ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è anyway it was nice and I enjoyed it so it happened a few times and we both made it clear that a relationship was off the cards as he was still in love with his most recent ex‚Ä¶ although he‚Äôd drop lines like I don‚Äôt want to hurt you or mislead you and I would respond by saying I‚Äôve told you it‚Äôs all good .. why would I wanna have a relationship with a man that is still into his ex.. so we decided to just be friends without the benefits .. although he was heavily reliant on this friendship and it felt like I was his partner,  friend , councillor.. without any reward .. 

I started to notice he was a bit mean in ways and would be paranoid and accuse me of stuff that was wrong.. he‚Äôd ask the most ludicrous questions and I‚Äôd respond calmly with an answer but he couldn‚Äôt accept it and would badger me like I was lying .. I decided to back right off but he‚Äôd come back so remorseful and sorry that id just let it go.. anyway he started recently just randomly talking about us getting together as in a relationship.. out of nowhere.. was random .. I said umm where has this come from and he was like I have realised I can‚Äôt go a day without texting you and I think there could be a future for us .. I‚Äôm so uncomfortable with this convo and talked him out of feeling this way and he back tracked but was still a bit in that space .. he‚Äôs been going through family court since his break up coz she wants to sell the house and he doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs kinda messy .. I‚Äôve stayed out of it as much as I can‚Ä¶ and then last night he calls me and talking 100 miles an hour about his ex and repeating stuff I‚Äôve heard too many times and geez it gets boring .. he is clearly not over her. 

And then by accident I think he tells me that when they met she had her own home and she sold it to buy the home he‚Äôs still living in now that‚Äôs going to court coz he won‚Äôt sell and she‚Äôs renting and dealing with this headache .. well omg I was livid and told him how low and disgusting that was and he has basically robbed the poor woman that he claims he loved and gutted she left him.. I let him have it .. then blocked him on everything. This guy also has restraining order in from his Mother and ex .. pls don‚Äôt judge me .. I know I‚Äôm an idiot for entertaining any of this .. but I too thought the stories he were saying added up and that he was just one of those peeps that copped a raw deal as he does also have a lot of family and friends in his corner.. 

anyway I‚Äôve come to the conclusion.. that this whole let‚Äôs get into a relationship now spiel was because he‚Äôs going to be homeless soon and might need a place to live ü§£ I‚Äôd be keen to know what you guys reckon .. sorry I know it‚Äôs a long post .. but any advice on how to stop attracting these kind of people into my life would be nice ..

i‚Äôve only had one job before at Mcdonald‚Äôs and i quit that over a year ago so i literally can‚Äôt remember anything other than how to clean ig 

last sunday was my 2nd shift and imo without much training i was doing pretty well. but according to the owner i was lazy and useless, and he said if i didn‚Äôt wanna work he doesn‚Äôt need me, and he said he doesn‚Äôt wanna be babysitting me.

first of all, im sorry but isn‚Äôt your whole job to babysit a trainee at least for once? also the chefs hate me and they‚Äôre so rude to me for some fuck ass reason but everyone else working there is nice to me

i have to go back tmr but i really don‚Äôt want to cus the man‚Äôs gonna yell at me again for forgetting to put a spoon next to the coffee or smth dumb like that

how can i redeem myself and make him not yell at me? i‚Äôve been trying to do everything that i can and take initiative, ask if anyone needs help but apparently im still doing it wrong ",1,1750495470.0,work,4,1.0,False

I'm in my third playthrough of the game right now and trying to optimize my island of awakening and how the NPCs act and interact. I know of the different jobs and what they do, and that they need rooms and sets to properly do certain things.
But I'm struggling to get the NPCs to act properly and I wonder if y'all got some tips for that, because I couldn't find a comprehensive guide on NPC behavior anywhere.
For example:

- can NPCs be manipulated to cross the border of their assigned area on the island of awakening? Either by building two rooms at the exact border or with the railway?
- How do I keep NPCs from putting the wrong stuff in chests? Half of my chests in my farming area end up with stones and ropes because of the farm.
- Does every field need its own chest or will NPCs just look for the nearest chest for seeds or to put vegetables in?
- Can I get NPCs to wear armor instead of normal clothing? Really want to gear up my party.
- I have both a bartender and a zombie but I can't get the NPCs to use the barrels. Instead they will take the raw ingredients out and just eat them on the spot. And those (for the drinks) are a hassle to farm. They should be able to make drinks, beer, smoothies and coffee, but they don't use the barrels. Is it a matter of placement?
- how do I stop my chickens from reproducing like rabbits?
- Can I in any way manipulate the NPCs to use the harbor area (where the captain stands) on the isle of awakening? (playing on console, not PC, but if it only works on PC I would still like to know the how)

And generally, what other ways are there to get the maximum usage out of your NPCs, what are some pitfalls people fall into, what is some generally misunderstood NPC behavior? I just want to really make everything optimal so that I'm happy and my NPCs are happy. ",3,1750494892.0,DragonQuestBuilders2,1,1.0,False

So‚Ä¶ this is the last day here, My girlfriend left the other day with our babygirl, she went to visit her 92-year-old grandfather. Yesterday was a difficult day for me, when she packed up, got in the car, and left. We weren‚Äôt really good, there was conflict between us.

She never wanted to move to Poland, she wanted to stay in Spain as it‚Äôs where she spent the majority of her childhood. I understand that, because I guess I feel that way about Poland. It‚Äôs something about your childhood and where you grow up and that sort of anchors, when you‚Äôre in your home country you feel safe, you feel at home. It‚Äôs the environment, the language, the smells, and she has this is Spain and I have this in Poland.

I can‚Äôt see myself living in Spain for now. It‚Äôs difficult in many aspects. Spain is a complicated place. We lived in M√°laga, one of the most touristic cities in Andalucia. We were a bus ride away from the center. The center would always be filled with tourists. They would shuffle off their Cruiseships in droves, crowding the historical center. I wonder how it is now in June!? Must be crazy. I‚Äôve seen coffee shops closed, most likely bought out by chain cafes/restaurants that profited from the pockets of tourists.

We lived in a town called Rinc√≥n de la Victoria. We called it the one street town, as there was a main road where all the shops, pharmacies, restaurants sat, and parallel to the road, just past the block, was the Promenade, where you could stroll for miles along the beach and/or sit at the dozen of different trendy cafes. And people did. Singles strolled leisurely with their dogs, old people shuffled along on the crutches, and families pushed their baby cars‚Äîthis was us.

The people liked us there, we made many friends, but maybe I will talk about this in another post.

Right now I am on my way to Krak√≥w, Poland. I am waiting at a bubble tea shop for a Flixbus which arrives at 8:40 pm. It‚Äôs going to be a 15-hour journey from Rosenheim to Krak√≥w with a 5-hour night stop in Vienna.

But I‚Äôm happy, excited, also scared! I will miss my girlfriend, I will miss my daughter. It‚Äôs a new beginning for us as a family. My girlfriend is grieving, she‚Äôs in a lot of emotional pain, because this decision was sudden. And I feel for her, I understand it‚Äôs difficult. She has to take care of our baby girl for the next 1-2 months. But she‚Äôs safe at her parents' home, and that gives me a bit of ease.

You can call me an asshole or think of me as careless, but I want to make a better life for all of us and Spain isn‚Äôt the place to do that for now. I don‚Äôt have real skills which can make me real money. I can do little things here and there as I‚Äôve worked in many different fields, but this won‚Äôt get me anywhere right now. Poland offers so much in terms of work and education. They have adult education centers there where you can build real skills and eventually get a good job. I don‚Äôt know how it will all work, and where it will all lead, but I‚Äôm hoping for the best.

I could have stayed in Spain, sipped my coffees, enjoyed the sun but rather I make the decision to educate myself and develop my skills, so that way our life in 2-3 years can be better. The plan is to move to Poland, rent a room for the summer, find a job ‚Äî most likely as a Glovo driver for start. Eventually signup for a Massage Course as it‚Äôs funded by the government, and maybe open up my own practice. It‚Äôs only a year, and I get certified at the end, which can open up doors. I‚Äôm hoping that my girlfriend will join me in Poland soon after. I will find an apartment for us, so she can feel safe, I will work so she can relax and know that I can provide.

I really don‚Äôt know how things will go, I‚Äôm afraid, but I will try my best to make it happen. Poland offers so much and it has saved my ass multiple times now. And there are many reasons why I chose Poland. My alcoholic father lives there, and he will most likely die soon so I don‚Äôt want to regret seeing him and maybe building a relationship with him. My grandparent live there as well, but we don‚Äôt really communicate, and maybe our relationship can be restored? I also speak Polish but don‚Äôt feel rooted in my culture, and would like to. I was born there, spent 10 years of my youth there, and maybe by living there I will feel more grounded, because I‚Äôm all over the place at the moment.

In Spain I could have lived an easy life, I could have found a job at a Cafe and made okay money‚Ä¶ but I know deep down that something would be missing - and that would cause me misery, and it has for the past few months. And maybe I‚Äôm just delusional, but why not give it a try? Why avoid the strong pull I have for my mother land? I trust in God to guide me and have my back through these next few months/years, because a lot will unfold for me and my family. And I hope that my girlfriend can forgive me for being so rash and spontaneous. I love her and I truly want the best for our little family of three.",2,1750494625.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

So‚Ä¶ this is the last day here, My girlfriend left the other day with our babygirl, she went to visit her 92-year-old grandfather. Yesterday was a difficult day for me, when she packed up, got in the car, and left. We weren‚Äôt really good, there was conflict between us.

She never wanted to move to Poland, she wanted to stay in Spain as it‚Äôs where she spent the majority of her childhood. I understand that, because I guess I feel that way about Poland. It‚Äôs something about your childhood and where you grow up and that sort of anchors, when you‚Äôre in your home country you feel safe, you feel at home. It‚Äôs the environment, the language, the smells, and she has this is Spain and I have this in Poland.

**Chapter 1 Let's Get A Divorce**  
Late at night, Rosanna Williams lay in b\*d, her breathing fast and her cheeks red. Her husband, Oliver Marshall, had been out dr\*nking during some business gatherings and had come home in an unusually cheerful mood.  He had been full of energy and didn't hold back when they got int\*\*ate, by the fourth round, they had already run out of c\*\*doms. During the final time, Oliver's eyes were burning with d\*\*ire as he p\*\*ned her down. Everything between them became a blur of heat and chaos. The p\*\*sion had been thrilling, but once it was over, Rosanna was the only one left to deal with the consequences. At twenty-eight, Oliver was at his peak--doing well in business and having a strong l\*\*ido. Throughout their three-year marriage, he had always been careful about using protection. In the beginning, Rosanna hadn't thought much about having kids, but over the past six months, something had changed. She found herself longing for a baby with Oliver. Oliver wasn't just handsome; he also knew exactly what to do in b\*d. And sometimes, when he whispered those soft, teasing words, it was enough to melt her. It had been a year since Rosanna realized her feelings toward Oliver had shifted. She had gone from feeling nothing to actually caring for him. To be precise, she had fallen in love with him. But Oliver's warmth toward her only showed up in b\*d. When they were not being intimate, he was just as cold and distant as always. ""Don't forget to take b\*rth control pills,"" Oliver said in a flat voice, snapping her out of her thoughts. ""A pr\*\*nancy would just make things messy. Rosanna just nodded in reply, feeling disheartened. She knew she was ov\*\*ating, but with him being dr\*nk, even if she did get pr\*\*nant, she couldn't keep the baby. Still, his words hurt more than she wanted to admit. Oliver put on his pajamas and walked into the bathroom. Rosanna watched him until he was out of sight, then finally looked away. Just then, a sudden phone ring shattered the quiet in the room. Rosanna took Oliver's phone and looked at it. The name ""Millie"" lit up on the screen. Millie Rogers, Oliver's secretary, was always gentle and graceful. She had a charm that everyone seemed to like. Word was, Millie had given up a top-paying job in Klenridge six years ago just to work near Oliver.  Officially, she was just his secretary, but rumors circulated that they were lovers. Suddenly, Oliver's hand reached out and grabbed the phone right out of Rosanna's hand. ""Millie,"" he said warmly to the phone, his voice full of affection and joy. Rosanna felt as if a kn\*\*e had pierced straight through her heart. Oliver never talked to her that way; his tone with her was always cold and clipped, never this affectionate. ""Oliver, someone's harassing me. Please come get me. I'm at the Zero Club..."" Millie's distressed voice came through the phone clearly. Rosanna heard every word. ""I'll go there now,"" Oliver said quickly. ""I'll have a friend nearby to go and help you first. You find a safe place and lock the door. Did you call the police?"" His face turned serious as he strode into the walk-in closet. Rosanna sat there, shaking with rage. She didn't even bother putting on her shoes as she followed him inside.  
  
Just a month ago, during an outdoor shoot in the northern suburbs with her TV crew, their van had veered off the road, crashing into a ditch to dodge a dump truck.  
  
Thankfully, no one died, but everyone came out injured.  
  
Her leg had been hurt and bl\*\*ding badly. Panicked and in pain, she had called Oliver.  
  
But Oliver had been at some dinner event at that time. Despite hearing her sobs, he had coldly said, ""If you can still make a call, then it's not that serious."" He had then hung up without a second thought.  
  
Yet now, here he was--ready to rush over to Millie when he was still dr\*nk without hesitation. Rosanna knew it had to be because he loved Millie deeply.  
  
Oliver quickly got dressed, still murmuring comforting words into the phone as he walked towards the front door. Rosanna couldn't hear Millie clearly, but she could hear her sobs.  
  
Standing in front of the door to stop Oliver from leaving, Rosanna bit down on her lip and said, ""You've had too much to dr\*nk. You can't drive like this.""  
  
""Are you being jealous, or are you worried about me?"" Oliver asked, lifting her chin with a glint in his eyes.  
  
Rosanna looked at him, her eyes soft, her voice steady. ""I'm worried about you.""  
  
""Save the fake concern,"" Oliver said, letting go of her face, his voice void of warmth.  
  
Before Rosanna could even respond, he pushed her aside, making her lose her balance and fall to the floor.  
  
Then, without hesitation, he walked past her and left.  
  
The house fell silent, and Rosanna was left alone.  
  
A wave of bitterness washed over her, so strong that it seemed to twist her insides. It hurt everywhere, but she couldn't even cry.  
  
Her face had gone pale, and her eyes were red as she held back tears.  
  
She stayed there, sitting on the floor, until her legs went numb. Then, she finally forced herself to stand.  
  
She didn't want to go back to the bedroom, so she curled up on the sofa instead, closing her eyes, her thoughts a tangled mess.  
  
Suddenly, the sound of her phone ringing broke the silence.  
  
The sharp tone pulled her back to reality. Thinking it might be Oliver calling her, she quickly got up and rushed from the living room to the bedroom, answering the call without a second thought.  
  
""Rosanna! Your husband just caused a huge scene at the Zero Club because of Millie! He smashed a b\*\*r bottle over some guy's head; there was bl\*\*d everywhere. It was insane!""  
  
Rosanna's best friend, Leah Ahmed, was on the line, her voice full of urgency.  
  
Rosanna tried to stay composed and barely managed to mutter, ""Oh.""  
  
She wasn't shocked. Knowing how far Oliver would go for Millie, she wouldn't have been surprised even if Leah had said he k\*lled someone.  
  
The Zero Club wasn't just any club; it was the most elite private club in Qegan. It was the place where Oliver often partied with his friends.  
  
Leah continued, ""Some dr\*nk guy cornered Millie near the bathroom and tried to ass\*\*lt her. One of the witnesses said there were hi\*\*eys on her ch\*st and that her un\*\*rwear had been p\*lled down. Thank goodness Millie had the sense to lock herself in the women's restroom before things got worse...""  
  
Rosanna didn't hear the rest of Leah's words, her mind drifting elsewhere. Eventually, Leah ended the call.  
  
Leah's call had wiped away any remaining sense of sleep from her, leaving her clutching the phone so tightly that her knuckles went pale.  
  
How could she not be angry about this?  
  
She had forced herself to stay calm during the call, clinging to the last piece of dignity she had.  
  
She tried to distract herself by scrolling through her phone, but the news of Oliver's fight at the Zero Club was already spreading across the internet.  
  
The stories painted Oliver as a p\*\*sionate lover, a man willing to risk everything for his loved one, portraying him as a bold and hopeless romantic.  
  
The more Rosanna read, the angrier she became. She couldn't take it anymore, so she put her phone away and switched off the bedside lamp.  
  
Surrounded by darkness, she felt her thoughts become sharper.  
  
In the three years of their marriage, Oliver had never once publicly announced their relationship.  
  
Instead, he had spent his time m\*\*gling with women from different cl\*bs. Millie, confident in his favoritism, had always made sure to rub it in her face.  
  
Right now, she found herself questioning her marriage to Oliver, the one that had already been decaying from the inside out.  
  
The sound of the door opening broke her thoughts. She checked the time; it was half past five in the morning.  
  
Oliver was back, but he didn't return to their bedroom. He walked straight into the study.  
  
Rosanna climbed out of bed, taking a deep breath before walking toward the study and knocking on the door.  
  
There was no answer.  
  
She knocked again, this time turning the handle to open the door and entering.  
  
""Did I let you in?"" Oliver's voice was sharp, his expression darkening instantly at the sudden interruption.  
  
Rosanna hesitated for a moment. Then, she gathered all her courage to meet his gaze. ""Let's get a divorce.""  
  
  
**Chapter 2 So You Do Know I'm Oliver's Wife**  
The study was only lit by a faint lamp, casting a dim light on Rosanna's face, which showed a mix of deep sorrow and strong resolve.  
  
She had said the word ""divorce"" with all the strength she had left. She had lost all hope in the marriage.  
  
Oliver looked at her, his gaze intense. ""Rosanna, do you even realize what you're saying?""  
  
""Yes."" Rosanna dropped her gaze, the nervous tremor in her voice betraying her emotions. ""I want a divorce.""  
  
Oliver's attractive face was filled with mockery as he lit a ci\*\*rette, letting the sm\*ke swirl around him.  
  
His sharp features became even more striking in the haze, while his dark eyes showed no emotion.  
  
Rosanna pushed down the bitterness inside her. ""It's better for us to separate now than stay in a marriage without love.""  
  
""My assets will always be mine because of the prenuptial agreement. If we divorce, you won't get a penny."" Oliver took a long drag from his ci\*\*rette.  
  
Her voice was flat, barely above a whisper. ""I know.""  
  
The truth was, she had been crushed by disappointment after disappointment in this marriage until nothing was left but despair.  
  
Oliver's boundless indulgence toward Millie had already crushed the budding affection she had felt for him.  
  
""Three years ago, the Marshall Group's new energy project in Qegan was placed in Jiford as a wedding gift for you. That investment, worth over a hundred million dollars, helped Preston become the head of the local government in Jiford."" Oliver's eyes turned cold.   
  
""Now, the project still hasn't made any profit, and you're ready to divorce me?""  
  
Rosanna's face twitched, his words hitting a nerve.  
  
Preston Burton was her stepfather. Three years ago, the Marshall Group's huge investment had given him the boost he needed to beat out three other candidates for his current position.  
  
Deciding to divorce wasn't easy; it was something she had thought about for a long time.  
  
Even though she missed the rare times when Oliver showed her kindness, the thought of him beating someone hard for Millie broke her heart.  
  
She couldn't take it anymore.  
  
""You and Miss Rogers can be together now. I won't stand in your way."" Rosanna managed a smile, hiding all the reluctance and pain she felt.  
  
""Millie and I never felt like you were in our way."" Oliver casually blew a few sm\*ke rings.  
  
Rosanna noticed that he still spoke Millie's name with so much affection, like it was the most important thing in the world.  
  
But for Rosanna, his tenderness only came during their most int\*\*ate moments; outside of that, he always addressed her in a distant tone.  
  
She clenched her jaw. ""I've had enough of living like this, being treated with no respect.""  
  
""Seems like you've forgotten how you became my wife,"" Oliver said, his eyes full of mockery. ""Do you really think you have any right to talk about respect with me?""  
  
Rosanna was immediately reminded of that h\*miliating, rainy night three years ago.  
  
A rush of hurt and h\*miliation flooded her heart.  
  
""You knew exactly what this marriage would be from the start, but you still schemed to get married to me, and Preston got his position because of me. So, if I don't want a divorce, you could only listen to me and bear all this. I don't care if you are treated with respect or not,"" Oliver continued, noticing her silence.  
  
Rosanna's body shook a little, and her face looked completely drained of color.  
  
So, in Oliver's mind, their marriage was nothing more than a business deal.  
  
At first, she had felt the same way. But after two long years of marriage, she had slowly started to believe this marriage might turn into something real.  
  
She realized she shouldn't have let herself think that way.  
  
Luckily, whatever feelings that had started to grow in her heart could still be crushed now.  
  
Oliver stubbed out his ci\*\*rette in the as\*\*ray and walked away.  
  
A few moments later, Rosanna heard the shower running in the bathroom.  
  
At that moment, her heart sank into complete despair.  
  
In their three years of marriage, they had never gone for a walk, watched a movie, or even had a quiet meal out together like normal couples.  
  
The only time things ever felt close between them was when they were in b\*d.  
  
The first two years of their marriage had been full of silent treatment and cold shoulders.  
  
It wasn't until the third year that things had started to change a little.  
  
Oliver had begun showing her a bit of patience and gentleness, something he had never done before.  
  
He would say a few kind words during the holidays or surprise her with small gifts.  
  
Slowly, without realizing it, she had started warming up to him, trying to care about him and learn what he liked.  
  
She wasn't used to housework, but she still learned to make different kinds of breakfast for him.  
  
Since their lives barely crossed paths outside the bedroom, breakfast was her only chance to keep him around a little longer.  
  
Even though she knew it was silly and kind of sad, she still couldn't stop herself from doing that.  
  
But Millie always came along to crush those tiny hopes she had.  
  
If Oliver cared about her even a little, why would he still be hiding their marriage from everyone?  
  
Once Oliver finished his shower, he walked straight into the guest room next door to sleep.  
  
Rosanna was exhausted from lack of sleep, but she still got up early and made Oliver his favorite coffee before heading to work.  
  
She worked as a financial news anchor at Q\*gan Television.  
  
The station wasn't as popular as it used to be because of new media, but her talk show still had high ratings, making her kind of a local celebrity in Q\*gan.  
  
After clocking in and walking into her office, Rosanna began to feel weak.  
  
She opened her drawer, grabbed the cookies she had prepared in advance, and ate a few, finally feeling better.  
  
She gained weight pretty easily, especially around her face.  
  
To stay camera-ready, she had to follow a rigid diet.  
  
Every day, she ate plain food like boiled eggs, veggies, and lean meat. She was very thin for her height.  
  
She had low bl\*\*d sugar, so she always needed a bit of sugar to make it through the day.  
  
With about twenty days to go before Christmas, her workload had tripled.  
  
She already had a live broadcasting show, Financial News, twice a week and recorded talk shows to prepare. Now, she also had to join rehearsals for the Christmas gala.  
  
While having lunch in the cafeteria, she overheard some coworkers gossiping and found out Oliver's fight in the club had gone viral.  
  
Her hands shook as she picked up her phone to check the social media.  
  
Online, people had painted Oliver and Millie into a fairytale--he, the charming trillionaire; she, the pitiful Cinderella.  
  
Many people who knew nothing about the truth were already pushing for Oliver to marry Millie.  
  
Rosanna's appetite vanished after just a few bites of the carefully measured lunch.  
  
After clocking out in the evening, she stopped by the pharmacy to buy the morning-aft\*r p\*ll.  
  
She took her time, carefully picking the one with the mildest side effects.  
  
But just as she was about to pay, she ran into Oliver.  
  
He wasn't alone. Millie was with him.  
  
Millie sported a dramatic bandage across her forehead and visible scabs on her hand.  
  
That soft, pitiful look she wore was enough to stir any man's desire to protect.  
  
Millie and Oliver walked into the pharmacy together, laughing and chatting. They looked like a loving couple.  
  
It wasn't the first time Rosanna had seen them together like this, yet she still felt pain in her heart.  
  
""Oliver."" She kept her voice level, swallowing her emotions as she greeted him stiffly.  
  
Oliver barely acknowledged her, his eyes falling on the p\*ll box. ""Take more than one; I don't want any surprises.""  
  
His words cut through her like a bl\*\*e, but with Millie standing there, she had no choice but to keep her composure.  
  
""Don't worry. There won't be,"" she replied, managing a stiff smile.  
  
People often said that children were the result of love, but to Oliver, they were nothing more than unwanted surprises.  
  
Or maybe it was just her children he saw that way.  
  
If it were Millie's children with him, things would likely be very different.  
  
""Fancy seeing you here, Ms. Williams,"" Millie said to Rosanna with sugary politeness.   
  
""You know, too much of that kind of m\*\*icine can mess with your h\*\*mones. Even the best brands can bring menopause knocking earlier than you'd like.""  
  
Though Millie knew Rosanna was married to Oliver, she still addressed her as ""Ms. Williams"" every time she saw her, never acknowledging her as Oliver's wife.  
  
Rosanna knew it was Oliver who gave Millie the nerve to act this way.  
  
She thought if Oliver and Millie were such a happy pair, why hadn't Oliver ended their marriage and made Millie his wife already?  
  
After all, three years had passed since they had gotten married; whatever leverage Preston had once held over Oliver had long since lost its bite.  
  
Rosanna didn't have the energy to talk to Millie. She turned to pay for the medicine.  
  
""Oliver dr\*nk too much last night and felt awful all day today,"" Millie said to Rosanna. ""Shouldn't you have taken better care of him as his wife?""  
  
The words grated on Rosanna's nerves.  
  
She turned slowly and met Millie's smug gaze. ""So you do know I'm Oliver's wife, Miss Rogers...""  
  
  
**Chapter 3 That's Settled**  
Rosanna stood firm, her eyes locked on Millie with the unwavering resolve of a woman facing the one who had come between her and her husband.  
  
She said, ""Miss Rogers, as Oliver's employee, you clearly know about my relationship with him. Yet, you persist in crossing the line and provoking me. Are you really foolish, or are you doing this deliberately to achieve something?""  
  
""I'm sorry, Ms. Williams. Oh, I meant Mrs. Marshall,"" Millie said, hastily correcting herself with a flustered look as she pressed her hand to her lips. ""I made a mistake. Please don't take it to heart.""  
  
She wore a look of such fragile innocence, looking very pitiful.  
  
Rosanna didn't fall for it. She knew exactly what Millie was doing--putting on a pitiful act to gain Oliver's sympathy.   
  
""I'm not worthy of your apology,"" she said with sarcasm. ""You're clearly the one who deserves sympathy here--poor you, always the victim.""  
  
""Oliver, Mrs. Marshall's still upset with me... Maybe it's about what happened last night at the club,"" Millie said to Oliver. ""Could you help me explain things to her?""  
  
Her sugary tone made Rosanna's skin crawl.  
  
Rosanna glanced at Oliver.  
  
Oliver took a slow drag of his ci\*\*rette, his face cold. ""There's nothing to explain,"" he said.  
  
""I just worry she'll blame me for coming between you two, thinking I am the other woman,"" Millie said, her intent clear.  
  
Without a flicker of hesitation, Oliver said, ""Millie, go get my medicine. Don't waste time talking to people who don't matter.""  
  
It was clear that in his eyes, compared to Millie, Rosanna was just a person who didn't matter.  
  
Rosanna suppressed the bitterness and anger in her ch\*st and quietly walked out of the pharmacy without saying a word.  
  
Inside the car, her hands trembled as she gripped the wheel. It took her two failed attempts before the engine finally started.  
  
Over and over, she told herself not to get angry.  
  
Three months ago, a routine checkup had revealed a tiny two-millimeter l\*mp in her left br\*\*st. She was due for a follow-up appointment tomorrow morning.  
  
Curious and a little anxious, she had asked Leah, who was also her g\*\*ecologist, why someone her age would develop something like that.  
  
Leah had responded with certainty that most illnesses stemmed from stress and anger. And in Rosanna's case, she believed that always getting angry because of Oliver was the reason for her illness.  
  
Rosanna had brushed it off at the time, calling it nonsense, but deep down, a part of her agreed.  
  
Because if she were honest with herself, the past three years had been nothing short of suffering for her. She had been angered by Oliver too many times.  
  
If her feelings for Oliver had remained as distant as they had been three years ago, none of this would've hurt her.   
  
But the problem was that somewhere along the way, she had started to care about him.  
  
As the sky grew darker, she found herself driving with no destination in mind, just letting the road take her.  
  
That was when it hit her--aside from Nexus Villa, she had no place to go in the entire city of Qegan.  
  
Nexus Villa, her so-called home with Oliver, belonged entirely to Oliver. Before the wedding, he had made her sign a prenup, giving her only temporary rights to live there.   
  
And with the way Oliver treated her, every time she entered Nexus Villa, she felt less like a wife and more like a tenant.  
  
Going back now would just mean walking into another silent, empty house. Oliver was rarely there anyway, spending most nights out at social events and not coming back until morning.  
  
To keep herself from feeling lonely, Rosanna made working overtime her daily routine.  
  
She buried herself in work every evening just to avoid the emptiness that waited for her at home.   
  
If it weren't for the need to get the morning-af\*er p\*ll today, she would probably still be sitting in her office now.  
  
Eventually, she made her way back to Nexus Villa. But as soon as she opened the door, the sharp smell of ci\*\*rette sm\*ke hit her.  
  
Oliver stood near the floor-to-ceiling window in the living room, speaking into his phone.  
  
With his back turned, he stood tall and composed. His voice, though low, carried a gentle warmth she had never heard before.  
  
""Dr. Griffiths said it won't leave a scar on your forehead. But if you're still worried, I can take you to Klenridge the day after tomorrow to see an expert. Even if a scar remains, I don't mind...""  
  
Rosanna remembered the white gauze on Millie's forehead from earlier. She didn't need to guess; it was clear Oliver was talking to Millie on the phone.  
  
Whatever small relief she had felt upon seeing him home evaporated. She quietly put her handbag and coat away and walked straight to the bathroom.  
  
After washing her face, she was applying some moisturizer when she noticed Oliver appear at the door.  
  
""At eight tomorrow, my mother's friend is arriving in Qegan. I need you to pick her up at the airport,"" Oliver said flatly.  
  
Rosanna sighed inwardly. Whenever Oliver approached her voluntarily, it was about requesting her to do something.  
  
""The person is an old friend of my mother's and also one of her business partners. Take a couple of days off and show her around the city. Whatever you spend, I'll cover it."" Without waiting for a response, Oliver turned and walked straight into the study, assuming she had agreed.  
  
Rosanna's ch\*st tightened. Tears pricked the corners of her eyes as she went to the study and said, ""Get someone else to do that. I have other things I need to do tomorrow.""  
  
Oliver didn't even look at her. ""Everything's already arranged. Karl will handle the driving and meals. You just need to keep her company and make conversation.""  
  
His eyes never left the computer screen. He didn't take her earlier words seriously at all.  
  
Staring at him, she felt anger rising in her ch\*st. ""I have a doctor's appointment for a follow-up tomorrow morning.""  
  
""A follow-up for what?"" Oliver asked.  
  
""I already told you. They found a n\*dule in my left br\*\*st during my last checkup. Tomorrow's the time for a follow-up.""  
  
""It's just a small n\*\*ule. Waiting two more days won't change anything,"" Oliver replied, still staring at his screen.  
  
Rosanna clenched her jaw. ""I waited so long to get this specialist appointment. I'm not rescheduling.""  
  
Oliver didn't even blink. ""You and my mother always have a strained relationship. If you can get along with her friend, maybe things will improve between you two.""  
  
His tone had no room for negotiation. ""That's settled.""  
  
Rosanna opened her mouth to protest, but the firm look in Oliver's eyes silenced her. After a long pause, she said, ""Fine.""  
  
After returning to the master bedroom, she touched her cheeks and realized they were already wet with tears.  
  
Her phone rang just then. She glanced at the screen, recognizing the number, and declined the call without hesitation.  
  
A moment later, another number from the city of Jiford appeared on the screen. Without even blinking, she blocked the number.  
  
That night, Oliver remained in the study. Not once did he step into the master bedroom.  
  
When Rosanna woke the next morning, Oliver was already dressed, ready to leave for work.  
  
He looked a little tired, with dark circles under his eyes suggesting he probably hadn't slept well last night.  
  
Still, the fatigue did little to dull his sharp features or the quiet elegance in the way he moved.  
  
""Karl will be waiting for you in the garage in thirty minutes,"" he said, checking his watch before glancing briefly in her direction.  
  
It was a fleeting look, barely enough for her to catch before it was gone.  
  
As he reached for the door, she couldn't help but say, ""Miss Rogers is better at playing hostess than I am. Maybe you should let her do this.""  
  
Oliver stopped but didn't turn to look at her. ""You're still my wife. If Millie were sent to entertain a family guest, it would only confirm the rumors of us having a relationship extending beyond the professional.""  
  
So that was it. He was using her to protect Millie's reputation.  
  
He must have known that people who were aware of his marital status had already been gossiping about the incident at the Zero Cl\*b last night, where he had beaten someone up for Millie.  
  
As he closed the door behind him, a gust of cold wind swept in, sending a chill down Rosanna's spine.  
  
On the way to the airport, she asked Karl Price, Oliver's assistant, how Oliver intended to deal with the growing rumors about him and Millie online.  
  
But Karl just gave her that slick smile of his and played dumb.  
  
No matter how much she pressed, he kept his lips sealed about the matter.  
  
At the airport, she and Karl waited until nine. Then, Karl got a call, and after a brief conversation, he frowned.  
  
""Change of plans,"" he said to Rosanna. ""She has postponed her trip. She'll be coming to Qegan next week.""  
  
A wave of anger hit Rosanna, but she quickly masked it. She didn't want to lose her composure in Karl's presence.  
  
Karl then drove her to the hospital. After checking in, she noticed a long line, at least a dozen patients before her.  
  
With no other option, she waited.  
  
After receiving the br\*\*st ultrasound results, she couldn't make sense of the images, but the text was clear--the nodule in her left breast had grown to 2.5 millimeters.  
  
Panic crept in. Just three months ago, it had only been 2.0 millimeters.  
  
That extra half millimeter felt like a warning bell, and it rattled her.  
  
  
**Chapter 4 I Have A Right To Know**

  
While waiting to see the doctor, Rosanna couldn't help but wonder--if the diagnosis was bad, would Oliver feel sad for her at all?  
  
She already knew the truth, yet her mind kept circling back to the question.  
  
Her follow-up was with Dr. Gregg Scott, head of Harmony Hospital's Gal\*\*tophore Department.   
  
As a seasoned expert with more than three decades in the field, he had a no-nonsense demeanor and sharp attention to detail.  
  
Peering through his thick glasses, Gregg studied the scan carefully. ""There's been a 0.5 millimeter increase in the past three months. I can't entirely dismiss the chance of malignancy.""  
  
A chill swept through Rosanna, stealing her breath. ""Are you sure?"" she asked.  
  
""It's also possible the imaging wasn't exact,"" he replied after a pause. ""If it had grown by a few more millimeters, then we'd know for sure. But with just a 0.5 increase, it's tough to say for certain.""  
  
""How likely is it to be a malignancy?"" Rosanna asked, her complexion drained of color.  
  
""Even if the growth is real, it's still under a centimeter, so it should be fine. I recommend another scan in a month. If the size increases again, then we'll consider a biopsy,"" Gregg said while removing his glasses to rub his tired eyes.  
  
After a pause, he added gently, ""A good mindset will be good for you. Eat well, sleep enough, and try not to dwell on things that affect your mood. Maintaining a good mood will improve your health.""  
  
Rosanna absorbed every word, committing it all to memory.  
  
Gregg handed her prescriptions for two kinds of medicine.  
  
When she was waiting at the pharmacy, fate decided to throw her a curveball--she ran into Oliver and Millie, the last people she wanted to see.  
  
She turned her eyes away fast, pressing a hand to her chest as if to calm herself. She wasn't going to let those two affect her mood.  
  
""Ms. Will--"" Millie began, then quickly corrected herself. ""Mrs. Marshall, are you feeling unwell? I know a few doctors; would you like me to introduce you?""  
  
""That won't be necessary,"" Rosanna said briskly, lifting her chin and walking straight past them.  
  
This time, she was proud of herself for not even glancing at Oliver.  
  
Since Karl had driven her here earlier and had already left, she began scanning the app for an Uber the moment she stepped out of the elevator.  
  
Traffic was a nightmare thanks to the lunch rush. No matter how many times she refreshed the page, no driver would take her request.  
  
Suddenly, she heard a familiar car horn from her left.  
  
She paused for a moment but didn't move.  
  
She had noticed the car. In Qegan, there were about three cars of that make and model. Oliver's car was one of them.  
  
Even if the car was indeed Oliver's, she didn't want to see him, especially not if Millie was with him. It was better to act like she hadn't heard the honking sound at all.  
  
But the car horn blared once more.  
  
""Get in,"" came a voice she knew too well--firm and authoritative. Oliver's voice had a way of breaking through all her defenses in an instant.  
  
She couldn't help it, so she turned her head and saw Oliver behind the wheel, his sharp features visible behind the half-rolled window.  
  
One look was enough to confirm that Millie wasn't with him.  
  
""Get in,"" Oliver said again, his tone brooking no argument.  
  
As if under a spell, Rosanna got into the car, taking the passenger seat.  
  
The car door clicked shut, and the window rolled up, shutting out the world outside.  
  
The signal changed to green, and the car eased into the traffic.  
  
If Rosanna hadn't bumped into Oliver and Millie earlier, she might have taken the initiative to start a conversation. But now, she had no d\*\*ire to speak.  
  
After a while, Oliver finally broke the silence. ""Did you get the results?""  
  
Rosanna leaned her head back and shut her eyes, remaining silent.  
  
""Did the n\*\*ule grow or shrink? What did the doctor say?"" Oliver pressed.  
  
Rosanna didn't say a word, acting as if she hadn't heard him at all.  
  
Winter sunlight streamed through the car window, casting dappled shadows on Oliver.  
  
Despite his displeasure, Oliver kept his composure.  
  
The car moved with the flow of traffic, stopping and inching forward until, twenty minutes later, they finally arrived at Nexus Villa.  
  
The moment the car came to a stop, Rosanna swung the door open and hurried straight to the gates without looking back.  
  
In her rush, she didn't realize a folded slip of paper had fallen from her coat pocket.  
  
Oliver stepped out of the car and picked it up. It was Rosanna's breast ultrasound report.  
  
He unfolded it and stared at the words, reading the note about ""recommended follow-up in one month"" over and over, feeling a strange sense of frustration.  
  
He lit a ci\*\*rette, took a few drags, then flicked it to the ground before dialing a number from his contact list.  
  
As the call connected, another incoming call from Karl flashed on his screen.  
  
He rejected it, finished his current call, and then dialed Karl back.  
  
""Sir,"" Karl began. ""I traced the package Mrs. Marshall received yesterday. Just like in past years, it was first sent from Jiford to Ekadence, then forwarded here to Qegan. As for the original sender...""   
  
He paused for a moment. ""Still a certain Mr. Burton.""  
  
""I see."" Oliver ended the call with a clipped tone.  
  
The cold wind brushed past him, and whatever warmth had been left in his eyes was gone.  
  
To accompany Oliver's mother's friend, Rosanna had changed her half-day leave to two days last night.  
  
Upon going upstairs, she immediately canceled her leave for the afternoon and the next day on the TV station's OA system.  
  
She had always been dedicated to her work.  
  
As a news anchor, she didn't have fixed hours, and the station didn't require her to clock in as long as her tasks and advertising quotas were met.  
  
But Rosanna held herself to a different standard; she poured everything she had into her job.  
  
With no family in Qegan and only Leah to call a friend, and with Oliver being the last person she could rely on, she had no choice but to depend on herself. So, she put great importance on her career.  
  
Thankfully, her effort hadn't gone unnoticed. In just two years, she had climbed from a regular field reporter to one of the top anchors at the station.  
  
She worked late, never took unnecessary days off, and even turned scheduled breaks into extra workdays.  
  
So when she had called in yesterday asking for an extension on her leave, Kyle Watson, the station director, couldn't help but ask her if something bad had happened.  
  
Rosanna changed into soft, cozy loungewear, walked to the fridge, and pulled out a few ready-to-eat meals.  
  
Once the food was warmed up, she added two generous spoonfuls of olive oil to them, something she hadn't done in ages.  
  
Gregg's words lingered in her mind. Until she got the final results of the next examination, she wasn't going to neglect herself anymore, whether it was her body or her emotions.  
  
She would eat the carbs she had sworn off, enjoy the fast food she had once banned from her plate, and, most importantly, stop wasting a single breath on Oliver, the man who could ruin her mood in minutes and keep her angry for hours.  
  
He could do whatever he wanted outside their home. She was done caring.  
  
When Oliver walked in, he was surprised to see Rosanna eating something like that.  
  
""Skipping your camera diet today? Did the results of the examination affect your mood?"" he asked, eyeing her plate.  
  
Rosanna took another bite, unbothered, acting like he wasn't even there.  
  
""I saw the report. The n\*\*ule is only 2.5 millimeters. There's nothing to worry about,"" Oliver continued, setting the paper down on the table.  
  
""You've been quiet ever since we left the hospital. Are you purposely giving me the silent treatment because you are upset with me?""  
  
His words struck a nerve. Rosanna set her fork down and replied calmly, ""I'm not upset with you. I just don't feel like talking.""  
  
Millie had gotten a bump on her head, and Oliver had been ready to rush her to Klenridge to see a top specialist.  
  
But what about her?  
  
She had a n\*\*ule growing inside her, and he, her so-called husband, didn't even lift a finger to get her better care. Instead, he picked a fight with her.  
  
Her response softened the tension on Oliver's face. ""What exactly did the doctor say?"" he asked.  
  
""It's all in the report; you've already read it,"" Rosanna answered, holding back her anger, though there was still a hint of displeasure in her voice.  
  
""I'm not asking about the report. I want to know what the doctor said,"" Oliver said, grabbing her wrist, his smile mocking. ""You're my wife. I have a right to know if you have a serious illness.""  
  
Rosanna winced from the force of his grip and glared at him. ""What kind of husband cares for his wife like this?""  
  
""Care?"" Oliver let out a chilling laugh. ""I don't need to care for you; you already have someone who does. I'm a businessman, Rosanna. I make decisions based on gain and loss.""  
  
The negative emotions Rosanna had tried to suppress surged up. ""So, tell me, Mr. Marshall, what exactly do you plan to do?""  
  
""Pack your things. You're coming with me to Klenridge for a full checkup. If they find anything serious..."" Oliver's eyes held unreadable emotions. ""We'll get a divorce.""  
  
Every word felt like a bl\*\*e, slicing Rosanna's heart open, making her ache.  
  
In her most vulnerable moment, even her husband was ready to walk away.  
  
How heartbreakingly pathetic that was.  
  
  
**Chapter 5 Getting A Fake Report**  
Rosanna's eyes filled with tears.  
  
Her hands by her sides were clenched into fists, and her nails dug into her palms.  
  
She had always known Oliver wasn't fond of her, but she had never imagined just how heartless he could truly be toward her.  
  
Not long ago, there was a story online about a street cleaner who sold his only home and started selling bl\*\*d every week on the black market just to afford treatment for his wife, who had uremia.  
  
Compared to that, her condition was barely anything--a tiny 2.5-millimeter n\*\*ule, not even confirmed to be c\*\*cerous. Yet Oliver already seemed desperate to get rid of her.  
  
""Forget Klenridge. I'll book a local doctor right away. Getting a biopsy in Qegan tomorrow will be quicker,"" Rosanna said, blinking back tears and struggling to keep her voice steady despite the emotions she felt inside.  
  
Oliver grabbed her chin, his eyes sharp and cutting. ""You're that desperate to be free of me, huh?""  
  
""Isn't that what you want?"" Rosanna shot back, biting down hard on her l\*p.  
  
The sharp taste of bl\*\*d touched her tongue, and the sudden pain made it hard for her to even breathe.  
  
Oliver's glare darkened with venom as he shoved her against the wall. ""After three years of sharing my b\*d, do you think that man would still take you back?"" He sneered.  
  
His cruel words ripped open wounds Rosanna had tried so hard to forget.  
  
He continued, ""You won't even look at me because you know you're guilty. You've been fantasizing about cheating on me all this time! He betrayed you three years ago, and you're still hung up on him? Pathetic!""  
  
Rosanna didn't say a word at that.  
  
She felt as if someone had snuffed out every last bit of feeling inside her.  
  
Oliver's l\*ps moved from her earlobe to her cheek and finally pr\*\*sed against her cold, pale l\*ps...  
What happens next?

Case fits perfectly (all parts). 

I can hold it in either hand if I need to grab my coffee and while there is perhaps the tiniest amount flex I can do this or hand it to someone by the Joycon without anythimg detaching (no I'm not filming a video, you'll just have to trust me). 

Dock pass through works as advertised (although it took a fair amount of fiddling to get it to seat correctly in the dock and I did briefly think it was a dud. It's gonna take a little while to adapt to the new docking method but the silver lining is that the dock is now very unlikely to tip). 

Is it as solid as the Steam Deck Killswitch? No it's not but the Switch 2 by it's very nature isn't as solid as the Steamdeck, you wanted a modular case for your modular comsole and that's what you got.

The day when we were gonna meet i was curious and nervous as am an introvert and i was more scared that a dude might popup out of nowhere instead of a girl üòÇ we were gonna meet at 1pm around but it was 1:25 and there were no msg from her side i was like this (guy) literally trolled me but soon enough i got a text from her saying she‚Äôs in auto and she will reach soon now i was fully ready to get trolled by this guy but instead she was genuinely a girl.


We talked a lot and i guess a lot from 1pm to 3pm about her ambitious my interest üòÇ we had awkward moment switching places too it was a good meet we chatted all along laughed and than we discussed our plans on how we can start from base and supply our cup brownies to small cafes and than we can grow.

We both decided a time and date to meet at my house i was more scared that she might feel uncomfortable to come but üòÇ she was more uncomfortable to bring me to her house as we haven‚Äôt talked to our parents about baking together so at the end both decided to bake at my house.

I told my mom that we have an college event thats why some of my friends are coming to bake with me and i told my cousins too come at my house so that üòÇüò≠ it will make her less awkward ( i lied about college event) so as the day passes gradually the date came she called me and i gone to pick her up and later she came to my house ü§£üò≠ and my friends and cousins were sitting in hall while we were baking.

üò≠she asked me for utensils but dumbass me dont know where the things are in my own kitchen we had fun moment finding all the utensils coffee and cooker ü§£ she taught me many stuff üòÇ but still she did 90% of the task in baking while all i did was to clean utensils so that we can use that again we both laughed a lot.


She mentioned me one thing üòÇ that aise hi vo first meet pe kabhi itna nahi open hui and khul ke hassi ho and kisike ghar ai ho ü§£ü§£but mere gharpe voto maast pali pe beth gai thi we chit chatted a lot again

Now we wanted few pics of our cakes so i told her we can go upstairs to our house she told me okay we can ho and by mistake even i told her we can go to downstairs (we have good display downstairs to take pics its a basement) after saying that i was like oh fuck no i shouldn‚Äôt have mentioned basement üò≠ she might feel creepy of me but she said yes we can go to take pics and we were infact going down but üòÇ i was ahead of her and i stopped because my cousin and my friends were watching us üòÇü§£ i thought they might get a wrong idea so i told her we can go later and she agreed.

We than gave our friends to taste test our cakes üò≠while she was in kitchen i told them to rate it and they said-its okaish 5 out of 10 i was like fuck you all mene and usne na itni mehnat se banaya ha and fr they were so good vo log bas masti kar rahe the.

(In short i had many good moments with her hope i can meet her again and we can share our laughs together so it was a very unexpected moment in my life which i thought to share with yall)

Celebrated a birthday with my family and sister-in-law today at Selera Delight.  We ordered a ""mini"" ube mousse cheesecake from [Memo Cakery](https://memocakery.co.nz/product/ube-creamcheese-mini/) around the corner (inside Gillies Cafe) and it was utterly divine.  The ""small"" cake was plenty for the 4 of us with leftovers and cost about $60 (aka <2 Fankery slices).  Sorry no pics of layers, but it was a mix of ube mousse with a smooth and creamy cheesecake layer and ube sponge.

Also, with the talk of so-called ""burnt"" Basque cheesecake, I thought I'd provide some context in the form of a well-informed article from America's Test Kitchen.

Note especially the comment from the originator of the ""burnt"" cheesecake and his feeling about this moniker.  (I've bolded and italicised below for emphasis.)

Also note that the Spanish name for the cake is ""tarta de queso"" and does not include any mention of being burnt.

The Story Behind the Famed Basque Country Cheesecake

This cheesecake, hailing from La Vi√±a in Spain‚Äôs Basque Country, is a global sensation.

By [Nicole Konstantinakos](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/authors/163-Nicole-Konstantinakos), Published on 12 December 2022

When my husband, Alex, and I first met in the Basque Country in 2006, we drank a lot of coffee together. In bakeries and bars all around the Parte Vieja in Donostia-San Sebasti√°n, a coastal city known as ‚Äúthe pearl of the Cantabrian Sea,‚Äù we threw back countless espressos on the way to and from our daily double shifts at Alex‚Äôs pintxos bar and restaurant, La Cuchara de San Telmo.¬†

But one coffee date stands out: when Alex invited me to [La Vi√±a](https://lavinarestaurante.com/en/), birthplace of the [locally beloved cheesecake](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/cookscountry/recipes/15199-la-vina-style-cheesecake) that was (little did we know at the time) poised to set off something of a global cheesecake revolution.

We sat at a small table, under shelves lined with spri

ngform pans of parchment-haloed cakes, and barely spoke as we swooned over the massive slices chef-owner Santiago ‚ÄúSanti‚Äù Rivera portioned out for us.¬†

At a quick glance, La Vi√±a‚Äôs cheesecake resembles a huge washed-rind cheese, with its caramel-hued ‚Äúrind‚Äù and creamy interior‚Äîfirmer at the edges and exquisitely soft and spoonable in the center.¬†

But similarities to funky washed-rind cheeses end there: The flavor of La Vi√±a‚Äôs cheesecake is the perfect balance of milky, tangy, and sweet, with hints of warmth and bitterness from the deeply caramelized exterior. No vanilla, citrus, or other flavorings interfere with the delicate balance produced by just five ingredients: cream cheese, eggs, sugar, heavy cream, and flour.¬†

La Vi√±a was opened by Santi‚Äôs parents and aunt and uncle in 1959, and Santi grew up in the restaurant. By the 1990s he was running the kitchen, and one of his objectives in making the restaurant his own was to perfect his family‚Äôs cheesecake recipe.¬†

Unlike other popular cheesecake styles in Europe and the United States at the time, for his version he opted to forego any kind of pastry or cookie crust and to bypass the fussy step of baking the cake in a water bath. He found that he could create a sort of natural caramelized ‚Äúcrust‚Äù and maintain a surprisingly creamy interior by baking the custard at an uncommonly high temperature. Above all, Santi wanted the cheesecake to be simple but refined.¬†

Fast-forward to the present, and Santi‚Äôs cheesecake has become a global sensation thanks, in part, to social media and the explosion of gastro-tourism. Chefs, journalists, and bloggers around the world have celebrated, imitated, and reinterpreted La Vi√±a‚Äôs cheesecake to the delight of their diners, readers, and followers. To some, the La Vi√±a‚Äìstyle cheesecake has come to be known simply as ‚ÄúBasque cheesecake‚Äù or ‚ÄúBasque burnt cheesecake.‚Äù¬†

***Burnt? While it‚Äôs indisputable that La Vi√±a‚Äôs cheesecakes sport deeply caramelized edges and mottled tops, referring to La Vi√±a‚Äôs style of cheesecake as ‚Äúburnt‚Äù is curiously exaggerated. Many chefs and writers even proclaim that the more intense a***

***nd uniform the ‚Äúburnt‚Äù top, the better.***¬†

***Cheesecake at La Vi√±a, however, is not described as burnt; it is simply tarta de queso: cheesecake. When my husband recently asked Santi what he thought of the ‚Äúburnt‚Äù designation, he shrugged and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs marketing.‚Äù***

In the test kitchen, our goal was to stay true to Santi‚Äôs original recipe but to fine-tune the details to help home cooks achieve consistently extraordinary results. Many recipes call for beating the ingredients together with a stand mixer, but this can incorporate unwanted air into the custard.

Taking a cue from the cooks at La Vi√±a, who combine ingredients in large buckets using gigantic immersion blenders, we got the smoothest, most wonderful texture when we used a food processor. We adjusted the amount of cream slightly to make it easier to process all the ingredients in a single batch.¬†

Perhaps the most important fine-tuning we did was around temperature: By ensuring that all our ingredients were at room temperature when we started and by nailing a target internal temperature (155 degrees in the center) for the cooked custard, we could repeatedly produce perfect results.¬†

Lining a round pan with parchment paper can be awkward, so we lightly moistened the paper before crumpling and uncrumpling it, which made it supple and easy to work with. Giving the overhanging parchment paper a trim with kitchen shears before baking enabled the heat to circulate more evenly over the cake and created more consistent caramelization.¬†

To complement the cheesecake‚Äôs unique tang and caramel notes, we made a simple [salted caramel sauce](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/cookscountry/recipes/15225-basque-cider-salted-caramel-sauce), inspired by a sauce made by Ana Rodr√≠quez, chef de cuisine at La Cuchara, using traditional Basque hard cider.",11,1750493719.0,aucklandeats,3,0.91,False

Absolutely.,"I worked as a contractor at a government office. Normally, we logged hours in 15-minute blocks. But a new bean-counter manager insisted we start logging our time to the exact minute ‚Äúfor accuracy.‚Äù

We told him this would waste time and wouldn‚Äôt help anyone. He didn‚Äôt care.

So I started tracking everything. I created a spreadsheet broken down by the minute.

8:00‚Äì8:03: Logged in, opened email.

8:03‚Äì8:05: Read email from Jim about printer toner.

8:05‚Äì8:07: Walked to printer to check toner.

8:07‚Äì8:09: Walked back, sent email response to Jim.

8:09‚Äì8:11: Drank coffee.

It took me 30‚Äì40 minutes each day just to log what I did, every single minute. I submitted it proudly.
After three days, I got pulled into a meeting with my manager who begged me to stop. I said, ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm just following your policy.‚Äù
