1lvzmko,https://i.redd.it/lo6ok5844ybf1.png,Oakcha Gourmand Collection Review,"This set contains 6 samples of original fragrances by Oakcha. Even though they are considered a dupe perfumer, they sell their original fragrances in a tester collection. I've purchased 3 of these collections, and this is my first review. 

***
Projection for all of the fragrances was good. Slightly less than what I'd expect for such a high level concentration, but good. The scenta lasted all day, though after 5 hours it wasn't projecting at all. In terms of quality, they've done a good job.   

**Caramel Brew**  
You're a freshman in college getting ready to pull your first all nighter. You head to the gas station to grab some supplies and decide a can of caramel macchiato sounds good. It's not as good as a fresh coffee but the familiarity of the scent of espresso still energizes you.  

*Top Notes: Candied berries, Espresso, Milk*  
*Heart Notes: Cedarwood, Coconut Sandalwood*
*Base Notes: Caramel, Musk, Vanilla*  

**Berry Bonbon**  
It's Sunday morning and your mom decides to host dinner, so you have to clean the house. To make everything smell extra fresh you sprinkle some berry carpet deodorizer.  

*Top Notes: Almond toffee, Pistachio, Raspberry, Rum*. 
*Heart Notes: Candied violet, Cardamom, Coconut, Pistachio*
*Base Notes:Caramel, Musk, Vanilla cream*  

**Lemon Cake**  
It's Saturday morning and you rush downstairs to grab your fruity cereal before Saturday morning cartoons start. Is the cereal extra lemony today? Or did the scent of lemon pledge your mom cleaned the table with making your cereal taste funny??  

*Top Notes: Lemon, Lemon petitgrain, Lime, Navel orange*  
*Heart Notes: Almond, Biscuit, Coconut cream, Orange blossom*  
*Base Notes: Amber, Blond woods, Caramel, Meringue, Musk, Vanilla*    

**Marshmallow Mist**  
You've just turned 21 and it's time to have your first legal drink! You decide to be *different* and make a cloud berry orange julius. You think you've reached the height of sophistication, that is until your friend tells you it tastes like the time she licked the inside of a sweet orange rind.  

*Top Notes: Cloudberry, Marshmallow, Orange, Star anise*  
*Heart Notes: Caramel, Honeysuckle, Milk, Roasted marshmallow*  
*Base Notes: Musk, Sugar, Vanilla, Woods*  

**Nectar Whirl**
I don't even know. It's a very sweet smell but also nutty? And coconut?  Ooh I've got it! Remember those feet scented scratch and sniff cards from the 90s?  It's like that plus simple syrup. 

*Top Notes: Caramel, Coconut, Sugar*   
*Heart Notes: Almond, Macaron, Patchouli* 
*Base Notes: Amber, Musk, Sugar, Vanilla*  

**Vanilla Gelato**  
Your partner buys you candied violets for Valentine's Day. A sweet, floral, slightly powdery fragrance. You realize eating flowers may not be your favorite thing, but it also wasn't bad.  

*Top Notes: Candied violet, Red mandarin orange, Cream*  
*Heart Notes: Brown sugar, Coconut milk, White blossoms*  
*Base Notes: Sandalwood, Vanilla, White amber*  

***
I usually enjoy gourmand scents but none of these are up my alley. None smelled bad though and I think the craftsmanship is fine, they just need to work on the names because they totally misrepresented the fragrances. Each scent was sugary so if you don't like sweetness you'll absolutely hate this set. ",1,1752109168.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False
1lvzm4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lvzm4m/aita_for_talking_to_my_friends_bf_behind_her_back/,AITA for talking to my friend's bf behind her back,"English is not my first language so sorry if i make some mistakes and sorry if my story doesn't make sense sometimes, i'm not very good at making a such a long flowing story :)

I (18f) have a friend ""Emma"" (18f). She is a great friend to me and we always have a great time together. We have known each other for 6 months because we work at the same restaurant in our city. Emma has a bf ""James"" (20m). Well right now he's not actually her boyfriend, but they are friends with benefits. 

I have recently found out that Emma is a serial cheater. During her relationship with James she cheated, and now that theyre friends with benefits (im going to shorten that to FWB) she obviously has the liberty to date other guys. The thing is, she is allowed to date other guys now that her and James are FWB, but James isn't. Which is very weird to me. 

You see, today we hung out, the three of us. Emma was a little drunk and slurred her words and you couldn't really have a coversation with her. James and I only had one drink, so we were still sober. Because Emma was a bit gone, James and I had no other choice than to talk to each other, if we didn't want to stay in complete silence, because Emma was busy texting other people. 

Eventually we went home and we watched a movie. Emma was a little bit more sober. I eventually had to go home because it was getting pretty late. 

Then, at 11:30 PM, James suddenly texts me. He texts me help Emma is mad at me and kicked me out of her house and she has blocked me on every platform possible. He then called me to ask for advice. 

You see, apparantley Emma was mad at him for being nice to me and allegedley giving me more attention than her. Mind you, she was quite gone and she was one her phone, James and I didnt have a lot to do. James also kept checking in on her and took care of her by bringing her food and water and making her coffee to sober up. 

(Also, she once got mad at him because he was downstairs without his shirt on and her sister walked in the room, so she saw him without a shirt. The sister does not have any sort of interest in James and has a bf of her own) 

James and I talk a bit on the phone and I realise what a hypocrite my friend actually is. Apparantley James kissed another girl while being FWB and Emma got hella mad at him. But yesterday Emma literally made out with another guy and James in the same day. (She told me not to say anything, which i also haven't.)

I have noticed from James' stories that Emma expects to get bf treatment (meaning he still buys her stuff and doesn't interact with other girls), but she treats James like FWB. She has also told me before that James said when they were still in a relationship that he felt like she was using him. She told me yeah i do use him but he still shouldn't attack me on that. I was like uhm girl what. 

James also has told me that the reason Emma wanted to be FWB was because she didn't agree with James' rules. James had very simple rules. 1. Don't cheat (which he doesnt know but she cheated multiple times during their relationship) and number 2. avoid other guys who have showed interest in you and are crushing on you and are prepared to steal you from me. I find those rules very reasonable. 

Because Emma is keeping James like a dog on a leash, giving him some attention from time to time and basically manipulating him into thinking she loves him but she's actually using him, I asked James how he felt about Emma treating him like that and if she was actually worth all the pain. This poor, sweet guy is very hurt by Emma. He loves her so much, but she causes him so much pain. 

I then advised him, that for once he should not chase her anymore (because apparantley she likes to be chased) and if she really cares about him she will come to him. Then if she comes, he should tell her that if she wants to be FWB than he should have that liberty too, and not just her. If she still doesn't agree with that, he should leave her. 

I hope I  handled this situation correctly but I do feel guilty. Emma is my friend and im basically breaking her and her well half bf half FWB apart. But the poor guy doesn't deserve this. He truly is a good bf. He is a bit of an idiot but he takes such good care of her when she has it difficult and he is a human with emotions, not a toy. But still, Emma is my friend, and I couldn't say James and I are friends, we barely have spoken to each other before this.

So, AITA for talking to my friend's bf behind her back?",1,1752109132.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

It was live action (not animated), and the intro was instrumental, kind of jazzy like smooth morning jazz.

The most distinct part, at the beginning, there were stone pillars that seemed to be standing still until something started moving under the ground climbing up one of the pillars the pillars reacted like they were scared and literally ran off screen. I believe this thing turned into a face after?

After that, the intro showed scenes transitioning between things like:
	A coffee cup
	A doctor’s stethoscope
At the end of the theme I remember a man sweeping the ground outside the bank.
	
The tone felt silly, but I’ve heard people say the show was political in some way. The theme was around 30 seconds to a minute long. I think I originally found it through a meme showing the pillar scene.

Any help figuring out what this show is would be greatly appreciated, I’m mostly trying to find it due to the theme which I liked the sound of.

Some of the most **profitable, repeat-booking STR guests**? **Golfers and anglers.** Here’s why they quietly pay the bills while your neighbors worry about off-season occupancy:

🏌️ **Golfers: Off-Season Cash Flow Machines**

* Golf getaways aren’t summer-only — shoulder season *is prime* for buddies’ trips and corporate retreats.
* A house near a **premium course** (hello Bandon) gets repeat guests who treat your place like their clubhouse.
* Golfers book midweek. They fly in, spend big, don’t trash the place, and come back every year.

🎣 **Anglers: Year-Round Bookings on the Books**

* Good fishing spots = early risers who need beds. And coffee. And freezers for the catch.
* Riverfront, lakefront, or charters? They extend your season well past the “summer tourist” window.
* Fishing cabins rent all winter for steelhead, salmon, or coastal rivers — in places big resorts don’t bother with.

**Pro Tip**

* Add boat parking, gear storage, outdoor wash stations, and sell that in your listing.
* Partner with local guides — they’ll send you repeat guests every weekend.
* You’re not fighting over peak Airbnb search traffic — you’re tapping niche communities with built-in demand.

I’ve never ordered or tried anything from Sorce, but I read a lot and I’ve scanned their website numerous times. I’m going to be using the upcoming Special Order window to make my first purchase and I’d love some feedback/thoughts/opinions. If you’ve tried any of these, please let me know what you think of them. I’m not so much interested in longevity or sillage as I am scent and experience. I’ll also include my likes and dislikes in case there’s anything I didn’t include that you would recommend. Also just love to talk about fragrance so tell me what you plan on ordering or your Sorce favorites :)

Likes: amber, honey, milk/cream/lactonic, most tea notes, orris root, cardamom, musks, vanilla, benzoin, hay, grass, apricot, most purple florals, rain, vetiver, sandalwood

Dislikes: cherry, leather, suede, pumpkin, maple, tobacco, gardenia, rose, cinnamon, pistachio, coffee, most tropical fruits (coconut, mango, lychee, banana)

Ofc there’s exceptions to all of this but I’m including it as a basic rule of thumb. 

**Aliens Go Ice Skating**: Winter air, sparkling snow, iris, black pepper, Indian vetiver, peru balsam, cocoa butter, tonka bean butter, tonka bean absolute, cashmere scarves, and a strangely colored sky.

**Don't Whistle In The Woods**: Cedar, sandalwood, cypriol, fir balsam, black vanilla, sugar, ambrette, and a hint of fur 

**Dragonfly Wings**: white lotus absolute, jasmine sambac absolute, umeshu (also known as plum wine), peonies, sparkling lake water, white rice, lily pads, cotton, blonde woods, and a hint of pink pepper 

**Nothing Burns Like the Cold**: Jasmine absolute, toasted rice, saffron threads, luscious caramel, a trio of vanillas (vanilla CO2, vanilla planifolia accord, and a house tincture of Madagascan vanilla beans), Ambroxan, and velvety musk 

**Reduced to a Thing That Wants You**: Yellow mandarin, pink pepper, tuberose, vanilla bean, marshmallow cream, sandalwood, nutmeg, sheer amber, warm skin and clean sheets 

**Tarot At Tea Time**: Wild orange, black tea, cardamom, fresh ginger, violet leaf absolute, smoky Java vetiver, and hints of labdanum and vanilla  

**We Are All Stardust**: Sandalwood nut co2, Australian sandalwood, beeswax absolute, Iso E Super, Ambroxan, labdanum, vanilla

I’m trying to narrow this down to 2-3 so I’d love to hear your thoughts! I’m also interested in **In Dreams and Fairytales** and **Moon Magic** but I’ll probably be getting those later on. I went overboard during the Alkemia sale, so I need to stay in my budget this time.😅

My emotions are incredibly unbalanced. Feeling very depressed and heavy, too much effort to move. Then anxious like the world is a terrifying place. Then a small moment of respite if I try hard to get my head on straight. Then the feelings crash over me again.

SSRI withdrawals? (iykyk) I forgot to take them for maybe 2 days, but that was about a week ago. Started taking them again - no appetite. I feel awful, my brain really doesn’t feel on my side and I’m having a hard time thinking.

It’s not the right time for PMS. But it is the middle of winter. So, that checks out.

I really want to drink. I don’t think I will. Yesterday the feeling was stronger. I also *don’t* want to drink at all. I just want to stop feeling terrible. I know drinking will make it worse. 

I’m going to go to class. Then the gym. Then I will clean at home.

Still off caffeine 😅 Mind you I’d rather drink a coffee than a wine, but I also know the caffeine helped lead me here in the first place.

“Some Things Deserve a Fight”


**The Teacher**

Morning hit me like a bad punchline.

I woke up too early, too cold, too sore, and with exactly three brain cells firing — all of them yelling “go back to bed.” But I didn’t. I got up, cursed the floor, and brewed coffee strong enough to strip paint.

Why?

Because somehow, for some godforsaken reason, I cared.

Not a lot. Not the hugging, speech-giving kind of care. But enough to wonder if Danny had slept. Enough to make a note to bring extra gloves for Tasha. Enough to remember that Gabe flinches when you talk too loud, and Sofia whispers to her sleeve like it holds secrets.

They were in my head.

And I didn’t hate it.

That scared the hell out of me.

I drove to the academy gripping the wheel like it might confess something. The sky was gray. The same dull, washed-out color the school walls always seemed to be painted with. But today… I don’t know. There was something different.

Maybe it was them.

I found myself rehearsing what I was going to say…

“Alright, Class F. Today, let’s try not to die.”

Or maybe:“If no one cries, we’ll call it progress.”

God. I’m turning into someone with hope.



They were already there when I arrived. Most of them.

Tasha was leaning against the wall outside the classroom, hoodie half-zipped, sparks twitching around her fingers like fireflies that couldn’t commit. Gabe was flipping a coin with his thumb, bored, but sharp-eyed. Livia sat quietly, sketchbook open, pencil moving like it had a mind of its own.

Danny wasn’t talking. Just sitting on the edge of the planter near the entrance, staring at his shoes.

And then there was Leo.

Or, well — there wasn’t Leo. Until I looked directly at him, and realized he’d been there the whole time.
Like a shadow with bad posture.

I nodded at him.

He didn’t nod back. Just… existed.

“Inside,” I said. “Let’s go disappoint someone important.”



We weren’t supposed to be visited until next week, but someone on the Board pushed the schedule forward. I’d gotten the email at 1 a.m. from the Dean herself, along with three warning flags and a “Please don’t embarrass us.”

Too late…

They wanted to see progress.
I didn’t have progress.

What I had was a half-wired spider-girl, a human firecracker, one blood mage in denial, and a stealth ghost with no control over his own presence. And the rest weren’t much more predictable.

But damn if they weren’t trying.



We got about fifteen minutes of peace before it happened.

I was inside the simulation room setting up dummy routines — just a soft reflex test, no traps, no gas — when I heard shouting from the hallway. Not the panicked kind. The teenage, testosterone-laced, I-think-I’m-funny kind…

Then I heard his voice.

Jerrod.

Louder than necessary. Laugh sharper than broken glass.

I stepped out, and there he was — taller, broader, flashier than Danny in every way. Hoodie off, powers visible. Literally glowing. Golden aura pulsing around his collarbones like stage lighting.

He had an audience. Not just random kids — other upperclassmen. They followed him like groupies, all of them laughing too hard, too soon.

And Danny?

Frozen. One hand clenched. A drop of blood already starting to trail from his nose.

“Hey little bro,” Jerrod grinned. “Still bleeding for attention?”

The others chuckled.

I didn’t.

But I didn’t jump in. Not yet.

I needed to see how far this would go.
And whether Danny would stand up — or fall apart.



**Danny**


I felt it before I heard it.

That hum in the air. That pressure in my teeth.
Whenever Jerrod gets close, the world gets louder. Glossier. Dumber.

I kept my eyes down. Stared at my shoes. One lace was untied. Maybe if I stared hard enough, I’d disappear.

“Hey little bro,” he called out, voice dipped in performance. “Still bleeding for attention?”

Laughter. Too many voices at once.

I wanted to say something. Anything.
But all that came was heat.

My nose stung. I wiped it. Red smeared across my wrist.

Of course.

Right on cue.

I could hear them — upperclassmen I’d never even spoken to — laughing like it was their job. Like humiliating me was a team sport.

Jerrod stepped closer.
I didn’t look up.

He leaned in, his voice low enough for just me.
“You embarrass me, you know that?”

My jaw locked.

“You could’ve gotten into a better class if you tried,” he kept going. “But no. You had to land in the freak bin. You’re the only one who bleeds by accident.”

I stared at the floor harder.

He laughed again. Real loud this time.

And that was when something shifted.

Not outside — inside.

I felt the blood in my nose hesitate.

Hang.

Not fall.

Like it was waiting.

Like it was listening.

My fingers twitched. I didn’t move them on purpose. I wasn’t thinking.
I wasn’t thinking anything.

Just burning.

And when I blinked, there it was —
That same shimmer in the air from the simulation.
Thin. Red. Floating like a thread in zero gravity.

Jerrod didn’t notice.

But the others did.

Their laughter stopped.

A second passed.
Then the teacher stepped in.


**The Teacher**

I’d seen enough.

Jerrod was still grinning, still soaking in the laughter, when I stepped into the hallway. I didn’t yell. I didn’t throw power or slam walls or give some heroic speech.

I just said,
“Leave.”

He turned.

Smug. Confident. The glow around his shoulders pulsed like stage lights warming up.

“Excuse me?” he asked, like I’d stepped on his spotlight.

“You heard me,” I said. “This hallway doesn’t need you. Class F definitely doesn’t need you. And your ego’s not strong enough to survive a closed room with me, so…”

I sipped my coffee.
Still warm.

“Leave.”

One of the upperclassmen behind him muttered something. I looked at him. Just one look. He shut up fast.

Jerrod laughed — a forced sound this time — and held up his hands like I’d pulled a weapon.

“Damn. You people really are sensitive.”

I said nothing.

He turned to Danny one last time.
Didn’t say anything.

Just smiled.

And then he walked off, group in tow, fake-laughing all the way down the hall.

I waited until the last footstep faded.

Then I looked at Danny.

He wasn’t shaking. Wasn’t crying.

He was staring at the blood hovering in front of his face like it was alive.

His eyes locked onto mine for a second.

And I saw it.

That flicker.

That moment of real power.
Not just instinct. Not just panic.
Control.

I stepped closer.
Not too close.

“You okay?”

He didn’t answer.

Just sniffed once and wiped his nose again. The blood dropped to the floor like it got dismissed.

Then he nodded.

Once.

That was enough.


**The Teacher**


The classroom buzzed more than usual.

Not the lights. The kids.

They were… talking.

Not just mumbling or throwing jabs — talking. Like real humans. Like a class.

Gabe was comparing shockwave control with Tasha, teasing her about “frying her own phone” and calling her “Battery Girl.” She rolled her eyes, but didn’t walk away. Sofia offered a spider to someone. I didn’t ask. Livia had pulled her desk next to Danny’s and was sketching his blood arc like it was a scientific anomaly. He didn’t mind.

It was chaos.
But not the hopeless kind.

The kind you get right before something actually starts to work.

I leaned back in my chair, sipping cold coffee, watching them bond over powers that were never supposed to matter.

They were training.
At home.
Together.

And it showed.

I didn’t smile.

But I felt it.

That sharp, quiet thing that hides behind pride.
Hope.

And then Leo walked in.

Quiet. Like always.

No footsteps. No sound. Just presence.

And suddenly… the room shifted.

It wasn’t dramatic. No explosion. No smoke.
But it was off.

Gabe dropped his coin mid-air.
Tasha blinked and sparked without meaning to.
Danny rubbed his nose again. No blood this time — just… tension.

Even I felt it. That little static itch behind the eyes. Like I’d lost a word I’d been about to say. Like I’d been halfway through a thought and someone cut the wire.

Leo sat down in the back without looking at anyone.

No one greeted him.

No one noticed him.

And the weirdest part?

None of them seemed to remember what they were just doing.

The laughter faded.

The buzz flattened.

Even Livia closed her sketchbook without a word, staring blankly at the whiteboard like she’d forgotten where she was.

I wrote something on my clipboard.

“Leo enters. Sensory disruption. Possible passive field. Subtle psychic interference?”

I looked at him.

He looked… not blank. Just quiet.
Present but fading.

And I thought to myself:

If this kid ever figures out what he really is…
He won’t need to be invisible anymore.
The world will wish he was.


**Tasha**


It felt like I forgot what I was laughing at.

One second, Gabe was teasing me about frying his earbuds, and I was about to say something smart back — something that would’ve made him shut up for five minutes, minimum.

And then…
Nothing.

Just air.

Heavy. Still. Static.

My fingers twitched. A spark jumped from my palm and popped against the desk. I didn’t do that. I didn’t even think about doing that.

It’s like something pulled my wires.

I looked around. Everyone else was quiet too. Like we’d all missed the same beat in a song we were dancing to.

Then I noticed Leo.

Way in the back. No sound. No eye contact.

Was he always there?

No — he just walked in, right?

Did he?

I shook my head.

Something’s off.
I don’t know what.
But I can feel it humming under my skin like a storm waiting to break.





**Gabe**


I dropped the coin.

I never drop the coin.

It hit the floor with a sound too loud for how small it was, and I just stood there like a clown at a magic show, trying to remember what trick I’d been doing.

Everything in my head felt… tilted.
Like I’d taken a nap I didn’t mean to and woke up in the wrong room.

Tasha sparked. Danny was rubbing his face again. Livia froze mid-sketch like someone had pressed pause.

Then I saw him.

Leo.

Corner seat. Head down.
No noise. No movement.

He didn’t even look at us.

And yet…

I swear the whole room got quieter the second he walked in. Not just the volume. The air itself. Like even sound was unsure if it should stay.

I don’t know what his power is.
But I know this:

He bends the room around him.
And no one seems to notice.

Except me.



**Sofia**


Mara stopped moving.

She was halfway across my hand, mid-leg-lift, when she just… paused.

That’s not normal.

I don’t control the spiders, not really. But they trust me. They feel what I feel. And I felt — I don’t know — wrong.

Not scared. Not hurt.

Just… displaced. Like I was watching myself from a few feet to the left.

I tried to whisper something to her — just a name, just a comfort word — but the syllables felt fuzzy in my mouth.

Like forgetting your own name mid-sentence.

I looked across the room.
Nobody was talking. Nobody was smiling.

Then I saw Leo.

And I knew it was him.

I don’t think he knows.
But I do.

He doesn’t hide.
The room hides with him.



**The Teacher**


Something’s wrong.

I’ve seen power before. Real power. The kind that bends rooms and warps expectations. But it always came with noise. With light. With something to warn you.

Leo doesn’t do that.

He walks in, and the air forgets how to breathe.

Tasha twitched without meaning to.
Gabe fumbled a coin like it weighed five pounds.
Sofia stopped talking to her spider — and that girl never shuts up to her spiders.
Livia looked like her brain skipped a page.

Even I…
I forgot what I was writing.

Just for a second.

Just enough to notice.

I’ve dealt with psychic bleed before. Once. Years ago.
It didn’t feel like this.

This doesn’t press against you.
It erases.

Gently. Subtly. Like fog slipping into a window you swore was closed.

And worst of all?

No one seems to remember it happened.

Except me.

And maybe Leo.

But he’s not talking.

He’s just sitting there. Still.
Like a statue sculpted out of absence.

So I watch.

I write in my notebook, under the coffee stain on page four:

“Leo: passive null field?
Cognitive disruption?
Memory static?”

“Effects increase when room is emotionally charged.”

“Test during conflict scenario.”

I close the book.

Sip my coffee.

Still cold.

I look at him one last time.

His eyes flick toward mine.
Just once.
Just for a second.

And I feel it again.

That… slip.

Like I’m standing on a thought that’s already forgotten me.

Tomorrow, I’ll set a trap.

Nothing dangerous.

Just enough to see if the shadows move with him.

And if they do?

We’re not just training broken kids anymore.

We’re sitting on something bigger.

And I intend to find out what the hell it is.

You have

Propisobarbital







(Optional step)

If you want to turn it into sodium salt form: (Extra)

Add 1.00 g of barbiturate to a clean 100–250 mL beaker. Add 20 mL of distilled water. Warm gently on a hot plate (no boiling) while stirring with a magnetic stir bar. Stir until most or all of the solid dissolves (some cloudiness is fine for now) Weigh 0.08 g of NaOH. Slowly add it to the warm solution in small portions. Stir continuously. The solution will typically become clearer. Optional: check pH it should be around 7–9 (if too acidic, add a few mg more NaOH). Remove the beaker from heat and let it cool to room temp. Slowly add 60 mL of cold ethanol (3× the volume of water used). Add it gradually while stirring, not all at once. The sodium salt will start to crash out as a white to off-white solid. Place the beaker in a refrigerator or freezer for 30–60 minutes to encourage full crystallization. Stir gently before filtering if solid clumps form. Filter the solid using filter paper or a coffee filter and a funnel. Wash the solid with a small amount (10 mL) of cold ethanol to remove impurities. Allow to air dry or use mild heat (40–50 °C) on a hot plate to speed up drying.

**Since Chizuru became the convenience store manager, actors, classmates, and even former “rental girlfriend” clients often dropped by to visit. Grandma Nagomi considered it routine and never interfered. But when Umi stepped into the store and approached Chizuru, Nagomi’s sharp intuition screamed trouble. She watched him closely from a distance. When Umi invited Chizuru to a café to “talk,” Nagomi, standing just behind him, saw through his intentions.**

Grandma Nagomi (calm but authoritative): “Sir, looking for coffee? We’ve got plenty right here.”

**Caught off guard by Umi’s sudden visit, Chizuru felt uneasy, worried he’d say something odd again. Desperate to get rid of him, she seized on Nagomi’s cue.**

Chizuru (forcing a smile): “Umi, our coffee’s great—better than any café’s!”

Umi (pausing, nodding): “Alright, I’ll give it a try.”

*Chizuru’s heart sank: “Oh no, now he has an excuse to linger!”* 

Chizuru quickly added: “Go buy it at the counter. Large is 300 yen, small is 200 yen.”

**Umi headed to the register, where Kazuo Dad brewed two small coffees. Umi returned to the dining area, offering one to Chizuru.**

Umi (eagerly): “Have one with me!”

**Recalling the pregnancy pamphlet’s warning about caffeine, Chizuru declined:** “Thanks for your purchase, but I don’t drink coffee.”

Umi (undeterred): “No worries, Chizuru. I’ve got great news to share!”

*Chizuru thought: What kind of news could you have?* She humored him: “What news?”

Umi (beaming): “I’m about to star as the lead in a TV drama!”

*Chizuru thought: What’s that got to do with me?* Politely, she said, “Congratulations!”

**Curious about the drama, she nearly asked but held back, hoping to end the conversation. Umi, however, barreled on:**

 “It’s adapted from a romance manga…”

**He launched into a detailed pitch about the show, while Chizuru stayed silent, her mind racing for ways to make him leave. She nodded occasionally, her eyes distant.**

Umi (pausing, probing): “So, Chizuru-chan, what do you think?”

Chizuru (forcing a smile): “That’s awesome, congrats! I’ll watch when it airs. Look, my boss over there’s giving me the evil eye. She pays me good money, and I’ve been slacking too long.”

Umi (urgently): “Wait, I haven’t told you the most important part!”

Chizuru (irritated): “What is it? Hurry up, or I’ll get fired!”

Umi (dismissively): “Fired? This convenience store gig isn’t worthy of you!”

**Chizuru, growing fond of her manager role, flashed a look of displeasure, her lips tightening.**

Umi (sensing tension, pressing on): “You could act in this drama!”

**Chizuru wanted him gone, but the mention of acting piqued her interest. She stayed quiet, letting Umi continue.**

Umi (excitedly): “The second female lead—interested?”

**Chizuru instantly recognized the manga—a romance she’d devoured countless times, all 380 chapters, and rewatched its three anime seasons. She identified deeply with the heroine, pained by the author’s drawn-out plot that left her unhappy, unfairly cursed by impatient, negative readers. She knew the second female lead’s role intimately—one requiring intimate scenes with the male lead. Her heart hardened:**

 *I knew it. He’s got ulterior motives, expecting me to throw myself at him or kiss him? No way!*

Chizuru (coldly): “Not interested.”

Umi (desperate): “But it’s a TV drama! Network broadcast! A major role, not some low-budget crowdfunded film!”

**Chizuru caught his subtle jab at Kazuya, her face darkening with anger.**

Umi (backtracking): “Sorry, your movie was great too! But this is TV—a rare chance. Think it over!”

**Tired of his persistence, Chizuru tried to shut him down:** 

“Don’t you get it? I’m not right for the role. She’s the petite one, but I’m as tall as the tallest female character. And she’s short-haired—I’m not cutting my long hair!”

Umi (relentless): “That’s where your acting shines! In season one, she was the tallest female lead and nailed it. Hair’s nothing compared to this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!”

**Umi’s stubbornness wore her down, but Chizuru held back her strongest reason inside her belly, determined not to share it with him.**

Umi (resentfully): “Do you know how much I sacrificed to get you this role?”

**Chizuru’s patience snapped, anger flaring:** 

“What you sacrificed has nothing to do with me! I never asked you to do anything!”

**Her outburst triggered a wave of nausea, her stomach churning. Grandma Nagomi, who’d been watching closely, saw Chizuru clutch her belly in distress and rushed over.** 

“Chizuru, are you okay? Did you eat something bad at lunch? Come rest in the office.”

**Turning to Umi, her eyes sharp as daggers, she said icily:** 

“Chizuru’s unwell and needs rest. Please leave.”

**Nagomi guided Chizuru to the office, leaving Umi no choice but to depart, his heart heavy with disappointment. As he left, he shouted:**

Afternoon hit and it got busy busy calls, errands, squeezing in a walk before the humidity doubled. And yep, there’s a stray thunderstorm in the forecast this afternoon, so I got home just in time.

I recently discovered these amazing 2-in-1 devices, and they've completely changed how I keep my home clean.

Let me break down what these machines can do. They vacuum up loose dirt and debris first, then use water and cleaning solution to deep clean your carpets. It's like having a regular vacuum and a professional carpet cleaner merged into one convenient device.

I've found that these combination machines save both space and money. Instead of buying and storing two separate appliances, you get everything in one unit. Plus, you won't have to rent a carpet cleaner every few months - you'll have one ready whenever you need it.

If you're interested in checking out some top-rated vacuum and carpet cleaner combos, I recommend browsing through this collection: https://explorehomedeals.com/Carpet-Cleaner

The best part about these machines is how they handle different types of messes. From pet accidents to coffee spills, they tackle it all. The vacuum function picks up pet hair and dry dirt, while the carpet cleaning feature removes deep-set stains and odors.

Here are some benefits I've noticed:
- Saves storage space
- More cost-effective than separate machines
- Convenient for quick cleanups
- Great for homes with pets
- Effective on multiple floor types

While these machines are slightly heavier than standard vacuums, the convenience far outweighs this minor drawback. My carpets have never looked better, and I love being able to deep clean whenever needed without the hassle of renting equipment.

For anyone looking to upgrade their cleaning game, you can find detailed reviews and current prices here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Carpet-Cleaner

Just remember to maintain your machine properly - empty the dirt container regularly, clean the brushes, and use the recommended cleaning solutions. This will ensure your combination vacuum and carpet cleaner lasts for years to come.

I'm honestly impressed with how well these machines perform both functions. They're especially useful for families, pet owners, or anyone who wants to maintain clean, fresh-smelling carpets without the hassle of multiple devices.",1,1752106993.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

You can now order your non-perishable groceries (coffee, tea, pasta, cereal, chocolate, soaps) through their website and they’ll deliver them in reusable glass jars in a tote. You leave the empty glass jars and tote out for them to collect when they come for your next delivery. Plus, it’s not adding any additional vehicle trips because they’re already coming to your place to pick up your compost waste. Plus, they have a fully electric fleet and are zero emissions as a company. I know this reads like an ad but I really think this model could be the future if there is demand for it.

My best friend and their partner opened their relationship to dating and hooking up with other people. I come from a religious home where surprisingly all the relationships I grew up under (immediate and extended family) were healthy one time married monogamous relationships. I didn’t see divorce except in a friend or twos parents. I want to note I’m not under a religious institution anymore. I am very spiritual but believe in many things and practice witchcraft. I’m not opposed to nonmanogamy in fact I’ve been curious about it for years a omnisexual femme who’s only been in long term committed relationships with two cis men. 

I’m just worried for a few reasons:
1) I miss my friend I haven’t seen them much as of late and they just opened their relationship officially a month and a half ago. Plain and simple I’m jealous and have grown accustomed to being able to see them three or four times a month from simple things like getting coffee to more fun stuff like diy crafting days / going out on the town. I’m autistic and struggling with unexpected change and rejection sensitivity 
2) my friend has been stressed at work lately and with their family. I’m worried that between this and spreading themselves thin that they may not be able to keep up with their wellbeing (they have a history of this)
3) I’m worried about me! What if -I- am the one who can’t adapt. I don’t want to be worried about any of this. I just want to be happy and supportive unconditionally without complications. I know I’m experiencing incredibly human feelings but it makes me feel small and like my journey of accepting others and myself is going backwards. 

Have you been through this before in tacking the beginning of your own opening up journey or in supporting someone else? I started reading opening up and it’s helped but I am seeking more resources to aid my mixed up feelings and thoughts. I love my friend and they deserve support and understanding that isn’t tinged with ignorance jealousy and or bias.

Lewis): Bar Exam Edition,"[https://kevinmzielinski.com/f/screwtape-letters-cs-lewis---bar-exam-edition](https://kevinmzielinski.com/f/screwtape-letters-cs-lewis---bar-exam-edition)

My dearest Wormwood,

It is with a certain fiendish delight that I write to you concerning your latest charge, a young soul preparing for that dreadful gauntlet known as the bar exam. Oh, how splendidly we can twist this endeavor into a mire of misery and self-doubt! The bar exam is a fertile field for sowing despair, and with a few careful nudges, we can ensure your patient stumbles into our clutches. Let me guide you in this delicious task.

First, let us exploit the sheer weight of the exam. Whisper constantly into your patient’s ear that this single test defines their worth, their career, their entire future. Make them believe that failure here is not a mere setback but a catastrophic end. Encourage them to see every moment of preparation as a referendum on their intelligence. When they miss a practice question—oh, how glorious!—let the thought creep in: “If I can’t answer this, how will I ever pass?” Feed that doubt until it festers into panic. A mind consumed by fear is far too distracted to focus on learning.

Next, let us turn their preparation into a labyrinth of inefficiency. Tempt them with the allure of over-preparation. You see, the bar exam covers a vast swath of material, and your patient will be tempted to master every nuance of every subject. Encourage this! Urge them to spend hours crafting meticulous outlines for obscure topics like the Rule Against Perpetuities, while neglecting the high-yield areas like Contracts or Torts. Let them drown in flashcards and color-coded notes, each one a tiny monument to their anxiety. The more they spread themselves thin, the less they’ll retain.

Oh, and do not underestimate the power of comparison. Your patient is likely surrounded by others preparing for the same exam—classmates, study groups, or those insufferable voices on the internet. Plant the seed that everyone else is studying harder, smarter, or better. If they hear a peer casually mention completing 500 practice questions in a week, let them spiral into self-loathing for only managing 200. Whisper, “They’re probably acing every practice test while you’re barely scraping by.” The beauty of this tactic is that it requires no evidence—mere suspicion will suffice.

Now, let us turn to their daily habits. The bar exam demands discipline, but we can twist this to our advantage. Tempt them to fetishize their study schedule to the point of absurdity. Let them spend hours planning the perfect routine—8 a.m. to 8 p.m., with precise breaks for coffee and existential dread—only to crumble when they inevitably fall behind. When they miss a single hour of study, let them feel as though the entire day is ruined. Better yet, nudge them toward procrastination disguised as productivity. You know the trick: convince them to reorganize their desk or watch “just one” bar prep video on YouTube, which leads to hours of mindless scrolling. Time is their enemy, and we must make it slip through their fingers like sand.

Physical and mental exhaustion are our allies here. Encourage your patient to skimp on sleep—after all, what’s one less hour when there’s so much to learn? Let them believe that grinding through fatigue is noble, heroic even. A tired mind is a vulnerable one, prone to mistakes and despair. Similarly, nudge them toward unhealthy habits—caffeine-fueled all-nighters, meals of instant noodles, and a complete neglect of exercise. A body weakened is a mind distracted, and distraction is our playground.

Now, Wormwood, let us address the exam itself. As the date approaches, amplify their dread of the unknown. The bar exam is a beast of many heads—multiple-choice questions, essays, performance tests—and each can be a source of terror. Whisper that the questions will be unlike anything they’ve practiced, that the graders are capricious, that the time constraints are impossible. If your patient is taking the exam in a new format or jurisdiction, all the better! Let them fixate on rumors of “trick questions” or “unfair scoring.” The more they fear the exam’s structure, the less they’ll trust their own preparation.

Finally, let us sow division between your patient and their support system. If they have friends or family offering encouragement, twist those words into pressure. When a loved one says, “You’ve got this,” make your patient hear, “You’d better not fail, or you’ll disappoint us all.” If they’re in a study group, let them resent their peers’ progress or feel inadequate in discussions. Isolation is our goal; a lonely soul is far easier to manipulate.

Be vigilant, Wormwood, for our Enemy is not idle. He will try to fill your patient with peace, focus, and resilience. He may even inspire them to pray for strength or seek balance in their preparation. Counter this at every turn. Distract them with shiny objects—new study apps, endless Reddit threads, or the temptation to “just check” their email. Keep their eyes on the mountain of work ahead, never on the small victories they achieve each day.

If you play your cards right, your patient will enter the exam room a bundle of nerves, second-guessing every answer and haunted by the specter of failure. And even if they pass—well, we can still make them feel it was a fluke, unworthy of celebration. The beauty of our work is that misery can linger long after the exam is done.

Your affectionate uncle,

Screwtape

P.S. Do not let them dwell on the fact that many before them have passed this exam with less effort than they imagine. That thought could spark dangerous confidence. Keep it buried.",2,1752106869.0,barexam,0,1.0,False
1lvyqzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_sia_ifell32/comments/1lvyqzx/my_son_made_me_and_my_mother_cry/,My son made me and my mother cry,"So i (34 F) struggled with infertility for nearly 4 years. When i finally saw the two pink lines i Was overwhelmed with joy and started researching names for both girl and boy. After my (small) genderreveal Party i Was really happy to know that i Was having a Baby girl and after lots and lots of thinking i picked my grandmothers name which is really feminine (in my opinion). After officially naming my Baby my mother got very emotional since my grandmother died 14 years ago. But enough of the side information. The point is: i really took time picking my Babys Name and it had a very deep Meaning to both me and my mother. Fastforward to now (15 years later) my son came out as trans. I was surprised at first  but still super supportive (he is still my baby afterall) and as earlier mentioned the name i gave him is very feminine. He told me that he was already looking into other names and asked me to choose with him because he valued my opinion. I have to admit i Was a little sad because the name he had really meant something deep to both me and my mother, but i wasnt going to tell him since it was his choice and i wanted my son to be 100% happy. After some thinking on how to introduce these news to our family (they are muslim while both me and my son are atheist) we decided to tell them over a cake&coffee meeting which is a Tradition in our family when theres good/big news. So i made my son a little cake and we both agreed to warn my mother so she wouldnt be too surprised, however she didnt get to know his new name before the others. My son cut the cake at the cake&coffee Meeting and similar to a genderreveal cake there was a pink, blue and white filling (the colours of the transgender flag). A lot of his uncles were shocked but everyone respected him (not everyone supported his decision but the Islam is a peaceful Religion so they still respected him and agreed to referr to him as a boy, accept his new name etc). When he was about to Announce his new name (he made envelopes for everyone to read at the same time to make it a little fun and interesting) i could see my mother trying to hide how sad she was. As i opened my envelope i read his name and started crying. On the letter it said Alexander (my grandmothers name as his second name) and then his lastname. My son always knew how much his name meant to me and his grandmother and he respected it the same way my mother and i respected and supported his choice of changing his name. After the name reveal uncles and aunts were chatting and i saw my son playing with his younger Cousins. While i Was cleaning some things up i walked by my mother Sitting on my grandmothers bed (grandma used to live with my mom since they always had a strong bond and were both divorced) and saw her crying. I thought something was wrong and wanted to comfort her but she just told me how happy she was that my son kept her mothers Name especially since it was so feminine. I started crying aswell because seeing my mom cry i just got really emotional. I cant explain how happy i am about this whole thing especially the fact that my son came out to me AND the whole family considering how religous they are.

1lvyqhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormonpolitics/comments/1lvyqhz/why_latterday_saints_should_be_libertarian/,Why Latter-Day Saints should be libertarian,"God can take everything from us, but he cannot take away our free agency, we as mortal individuals have the ability to know good from evil, and to choose to follow God's plan or not (2Nephi 2:27). Satan's plan is to destroy that very agency, by forcing people to choose (Moses 4:3). Thus we must obey the kingdom of God not the unrighteous dominion of men, we should obey the law, as far as it is in accordance with our God given rights as set out in the United States constitution (D&C 98:5).

This has radical implications; while we must live the law of consecration and help the poor, whether suffering from financial, spiritual or social poverty, it does not mean that we should impose it by breaking the commandment ""thou shall not steal"" with high taxes, regulations and bureaucracy. And while we must be chaste and modest and support traditional family it does not mean we should break the 11th article of faith and impose our beliefs or way of life on others with laws restricting religious freedom, gay rights or fornication.

For example God give us the word of wisdom because he knows how to care for our body as temple, but we don't outlaw alcohol or coffee. We can be both morally against it and respect free agency of other people in my opinion, same can apply to everything. We are in the world but not of the world. We should advance the cause of the church and expose the gadianton robbers and secret combinations of the state, wherever we are.

The governments of the world are becoming increasingly mean and wars are popping up everywhere, especially in the middle east. Im french, but i know the political turmoil happening in the USA is also a sign of the last days, as prophesied by Joseph Smith that ""even this nation will be on the very verge of crumbling to pieces"" and that someday the constitution will need to be saved by our people, members of this church. Both political parties stand increasingly against the US constitution. I think we need to support all freedoms, stand against all government tyranny as we have suffured from it in the past.

If you disagree with me, regardless of your interpretation, it's important to support civic dialogue of faith and politics as Dallin H. Oaks outlined in the October 2024 general conference. It's also important to support candidates of good moral character and peaceful transition of power.

I'm glad this subreddit exist and that everyone is welcome. I made this new post to engage in civic discussion regardless of your faith. ",0,1752106572.0,mormonpolitics,10,0.33,False

1lvynsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/1lvynsc/how_i_met_my_wife_on_splatoon_2/,How I met my Wife on Splatoon 2,"
It all started during a particularly sweaty Turf War in *Splatoon 2*. It was late 2018, and I was deep in my ""gamer hermit"" era. Every night after work, I'd fire up my Switch, throw on a headset, and lose hours to inky battles. I wasn’t looking for love. I was just trying to rank up.

Then I noticed her.

Not her voice we weren’t even on voice chat yet. It was her *playstyle*. She was my random teammate in a game on Kelp Dome. While the rest of us flailed around with Aerosprays and Chargers, she was calmly flanking, inking key routes, and covering for teammates like a pro. Her name was ""SquidVicious,"" and she *saved my inked butt* at least three times that match.

I sent her a friend request. No expectations just respect.

To my surprise, she accepted.

A few nights later, we ended up in the same squad again. This time we had voice chat on Discord. Her voice was warm, confident, and a little sarcastic. She teased me for main-ing the Splat Roller  said it was a ""baby’s crutch weapon."" I called her a “meta slave” for always picking Dualies. Instant chemistry.

What started as a few matches a week turned into nightly sessions. We started talking about more than just Splatoon. Favorite games. Music. Books. Life. She lived in Portland; I was in Chicago. Entire time zones apart, but it didn’t matter...our schedules aligned like fate had written a script.

Eight months in, we finally met IRL at PAX West. I knew it was real when she beat me in a 1v1 on Moray Towers, then handed me a victory coffee with a grin like she’d been waiting to do that for years.

Fast forward a couple years, a dozen flights, a pandemic, and a *very* Splatoon-themed wedding cake later… we’re married.

Our first dance? A string quartet version of the *Splatoon 2* lobby music. Judge us all you want ...we still run ranked together. And yes, she *still* carries me.

1lvynf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lvynf3/is_this_neglect/,Is this neglect?,"I 16 f, have been having problems with my mom 41 f. She keeps arguing with me over small things such as me missing one dish or my clothes. Mind u. When I say arguing I do not mean small disagreements, i mean screaming, yelling, swearing, and her purposely trying to get a reaction. 

I got into an arguement with her on the ride home from a friend's because we had gotten onto the topic of clothes. I recently just got rid of an entire trash bag of them. And that may sound like a lot but to provide context, every piece of clothing I own is either 5-6 years old (I would've been 10-11) or i bought it, or she bought it and it's 3 sizes to big, because she likes to believe that because she's a big women, I am too, I am chubby but I am not as big as her, shes about a size 16, I'm a size 10- 12 depending on the brand,however she buys me stuff in her own sizing despite me telling her it'll be too big for me. 

Currently, I've have maybe 6 pairs of pants, 1 of which she bought and doesn't match literally anything i have. I have practically no t shirts that fit, and a bunch of hoodies I cant wear in summer. And 1 pair of boxy shorts. I told her I needed to go shopping and she told me id have to buy them and she'd pay me back. And that she would only be okay paying me back for cheap stuff that she liked. Meaning pretty much nothing my style. When we go shopping she always makes me buy shirts that I don't like, and I mean shirts that should be for 8 year olds that have the pink glittery letters and sayings like ""girls rule"". And the pants are even worse. Boxy, itchy, uncomfortable, plain pants. Shorts are usually way too tight and hard to get on or boxy and boyish, which i don't care for because of the way it crumples. So if I were to go shopping with her and buy my stuff it'll all be stuff that isn't even in my age group of clothes.

I always ends up having to buy my stuff. School binders, pencils, backpacks, high lighters, rulers, calculators, my phone, my laptop, my ear buds, my over ear headphones, my books, my journals, my lined paper, I even had to buy my own bras this year because I had 2, and one was practically falling apart and the other one was a cheap zipper one that randomly unzipped in class all the time, luckily I wear hoodies, but I can't be risking that in public, especially at my age. Any money we have goes towards their smokes or stuff they wanna do. I pointed out that id rather get a new bra that I actually need then go see a monster truck derby, and she got upset and said that they get bored and don't always wanna work. Which I get. But when u choose to have kids, u can't just ignore the stuff they need. Like with the bra, im not flat chested at all, meaning I can not get away with not wearing one, so it's literally a necessity at my age, and I had to spend almost 60 dollars of my hard earned money to buy them because she bought cigarettes.

She also refused to buy a sponge for almost 4 months, mind u, I have to do all the dishes, so they were forcing me to do dishes with a rag, and finally, I told her no, that i had literally 2 rules, rinse the super dirty dishes that have sauce and or coffee or something, and I want a sponge. She got upset and whiny.

She also tends to scream at me when I dont do what she wants when she wants. Such as, a few weeks ago I went downstairs to make food and she wanted dishes done, that she wasn't using, that she had made in the middle of the day, and when I said they could wait till after dinner because we didn't need them she flipped out and called me lazy, and mean, and said that I always do this, and I never wanna do my chores. Mind u, I was making food because I get dizzy spells randomly, and was hoping food would help. I snapped after 5 minutes of being yelled at for no reason and told her this was why I wanted to move out, to which she bashed my friend and her mom who she found out I would move in with, and started calling me and my friends family spoiled and bratty and terrible and all kinds of names. Then stormed out for a smoke. Came back in and started telling me I was stupid for wanting to leave and she wasn't that bad and this is normal parenting. And when I didnt respond with being mean and I actually stayed calm she bashed my friend and her mon again for no reason, wasn't even in the conversation at this point. So I told her to get out. To which she got up in my face and kept yelling. When I continued to cut her off while she spoke by telling her to get out she got annoyed and walked out and then said something about my friend again. At this point I was dizzy. Nauseous, over whelmed, and upset, so I screamed at her to get the fuck out of my room and leave me alone. She then screamed in was grounded and walked off. Then later tried to have a 'talk with me' when her boyfriend was home, played the victim and pretty much drew a picture of me being oh so mean to her and yelling at her because her back hurts and she just wanted to make sure my chores were done and I'd apparently lashed out for no good reason. Then kept cutting me off, ignoring me, then somehow changed the conversation to my attitude, then how I was mean and angry, then my clothes. Then started saying that if I were different religions I would have to dress more modest. So I stopped her and simply said it wasn't relevant to the conversation. She got hurt and whiney and even her boyfriend said she was bringing up stuff that didn't matter right now. So I went upstairs. She then, in the same day. Followed me upstairs while I was doing my laundry and started telling me I was mean to her and a bunch of other stuff and saying I shouldn't be allowed to hang out with friends, and after the 5th time of her cutting me off I told her that if she was gonna keep talking over me like I was stupid then she could leave me alone till she was ready to talk to me like a person and not an object with no feelings. 4 arguements in 1 day over 2 plates and a container she wanted washed that we didn't even need washed.

She will frequently do this, where something small will happen. She'll make it a big deal and yell at me all day. And if I don't get mad she'll change the topic or bring up friends or family or something important to me over and over until I snap, she will purposely try to get a reaction, and then every time she plays victim and talks about how mean I am to her. And if I end the conversation she will follow me to me room and get in my face, mind u. I don't have a door so I can not lock her out. And I can't leave because we live in the country, the closest town is a 5 minute drive, and almost an hour and a half of walking.

When I was little she would frequently scream at me over my room not being clean, mind u she never taught me how to clean it, and then she would make it worse. Dump every drawer I had out and make me spend my whole day re organizing and cleaning and folding things. One day she kept me up till 2 am screaming about my room and telling me she'd send me to a mental hospital. Another time, she told me and my brother she was gonna take my dog to get put down, not a surprise, he was sick and in bad shape. So I hugged him goodbye and she left. I cried for hours. Found out she put him on a high way because she couldn't find a place. Tried to lie to me by saying he chased a squirrel. The dog could barely walk down 2 small steps in our yard. On another occasion she screamed in my face about how I missed a dish, which wad a singular lid to a container, and when I wouldn't wash it because she was yelling at me, she literally told me she might as well go blow her brains out and kill herself in the car because I hated her so much. I tried to slam a closet, and she stuck her hand in the way, then screamed in had assaulted her and grounded me.

She also constantly picks at things, everything from my clothes to my makeup and hair and who I hang out with. And not in the normal way of maybe my makeup is a bit smudged. But no, she'll comment on the lip colour I use. My lashes, my eye shadow, my shirt, my pants, my hair. And she will find something to pick at. And it's not just my appearance. She called me a toddler because she keeps purposely upsetting me and trying to get a reaction and then playing innocent when I snap. Like she'll sit there and constantly remind me of my chores as I do them and when I get annoyed she'll act all innocent and say she only reminded me twice when she really did it 10 times in 2 hours.

She also refuses to believe anything is wrong with me. She won't believe  me when I say my head hurts or im sick or my stomach hurts. She won't believe me when I say im dizzy or I feel nauseous or im sore. And she refuses to get me meds, she will also leave doctors appointments till the absolute last minute. She refuses to listen to any of my problems and downplay every single once. She also likes to get in my face during arguements just enough that it's not physical but clearly to upset me, and then say shes not doing it as she continues to do it. 

She also keeps putting my important stuff off, like for my 8th grade grad she made me get a hand me down dress for free that didn't fit because she forgot, for my birthday last year she bought me a bunch of last minute gifts that I didn't even like and never mentioned, i mean, she bought me a murder mystery book I never even heard of, 3 fish net headbands, and hair elastics. She won't buy my school stuff, my friend had to give me her old shoes because mine had literal holes in them and she ""couldn't afford new ones"" so she was gonna make me buy them. She once forgot to buy me pads for 3 months and my friends mom bought them for me. I was going to a dance with my ex once and she made me wait till after week before and made me buy a thrift store dress and then told me i looked like a slut  because it was low cut even though she approved it at first. She also waited till it was almost too late to get me my birth control last month and I almost completely ran out of it because she kept forgetting to make an appointment. I have needed teeth pulled for 2 years and she still hasn't done that either.

She also frequently will leave me home alone with almost nothing to eat, and the stuff i can eat im not allowed to make, and the stuff i can eat is usually stuff i really hate, like a peanut butter sandwich, or even when she's home, sometimes there's literally nothing to eat and I'll go all day without eating and then she'll make a small dinner. If I get upset because im hungry she whines about how she hasnt eaten either. Then call me spoiled. To the point that my friend has offered to literally make me prep meals to bring home so I can have lunch.

I’m a 25-year-old Middle Eastern doctor, currently navigating the beautiful chaos that is life and medicine. I’m relaxed by nature, grounded in faith, and always trying to balance ambition with peace of mind. I’m here in the hopes of meeting someone kind, thoughtful, and genuinely interested in building a meaningful connection.

When I’m not working long shifts or juggling hospital drama (the real kind, not Grey’s Anatomy), I’m usually out for walks, swimming, hiking when I can escape the city, or checking out new cafés and restaurants. I’m also a reader at heart; Murakami is my go-to, and if you’ve read Kafka on the Shore, we’re already off to a great start.

Medicine is something I’m genuinely passionate about. It’s not just a career, it’s a calling, with all the highs and lows that come with it. It’d be amazing to meet someone who either shares that passion or at least understands what it’s like being in this field.

I’m 5’11”, tan skin, black hair, brown eyes, and a light beard. I speak Arabic fluently, and I’d love to connect with someone who speaks another language too. I think being bilingual adds a unique layer to how we see the world and relate to others.

I'm looking to meet someone between 21 and 25. Someone who’s sincere, curious about life, and open to building something real. Bonus points if you’re kind, a little nerdy, or like long conversations over good coffee (or tea I’m flexible 😄).

If this resonated with you at all, I’d really appreciate it if you messaged me with a bit about yourself and maybe a photo too. I’m happy to do the same.

Looking forward to hearing from you ✨

I met this Capricorn, VERY handsome, tall, athletic, seemed very mature and didn’t really have time for games. He was a mover so buff naturally. I met this contestant online where all my other contestants seem to come from in terms of dating, and I actually asked him out simply because I had some liquid courage in me. I didn’t think he’d be responding cause he was WAY out of my league but he actually did pretty fast. Anyway, we went to a coffee/ bar house - laughs, flirtatious smiles, ended with a hug and an agreement to a second date. Second date did not go so well. We went to the movie theaters to see Ballarina, and he was cracking jokes so I laughed like a normal person would and lightly brushed his arm in a, “Omg, stop! Oh Capricorn you’re so funny” the of way. Eventually the movie came on. Few minutes in and he just got up and left. Just got up and left. No words, nothing. So naturally, I thought he got up to use the bathroom and then come back right? BUT AFTER 10 MINUTES something told me somethin was up and I got up to go check on him to see if he was okay. 

“Capie…? You okay? Everything good or did you have a little accident?” 

No response, so I asked the front desk if they’d seen a man leave matching his description and lo and behold they said he left about 15 minutes ago. 

Why do I attract the wrong guys? I texted him asking what happened but no response. I don’t know anyone who just up and leaves their date at a movie theater especially when they were the one driving. And I even told him about my medical condition and how I have seizures. What if I had a seizure right then and there? 

My mind told me he wasn’t worth waiting on a reply so I just blocked him because anyone who’s just gonna bail knowing something that serious could happen at ANY time is a dangerous guy.

Hello , just a sad situation where I need advice since it’s been eating me on inside. Little background of mine , I’m a dog person , I use to volunteer at my local shelters when I was in college so this hit me harder than most. A year ago I got a great job and began taking my regular coffee breaks outside in the parking lot , within the weeks I began noticing a small black chihuahua hanging around my job. I befriended this little rascal as he always seem to hang  around my breaks . I walked around the place while he followed me around , I brought him snacks etc etc but always wondered why his owners let him out but never did find out.The little  guy  always went back home after spending time around the property. One day on the weekend when the place was empty I drove through and brought my own dog and rascal was there hanging around, they both seem to bond. I was happy and (don’t shame me ) thought of taking rascal home since his owners seem to not care but refrained because I knew he had a family . One day I stopped seeing the pup , two months went by and nothing , eventually i crossed the street to the near by houses and asked about him. A woman informed me he was hit by a truck and sadly didn’t make it , I was stunned and went back to work . As i sit on my desk I ask myself if stealing him would’ve been the best thing I could’ve done . It’s just eating me inside knowing I had the chance to save and give him a forever home.",1,1752105823.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1lvy8xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1lvy8xe/purchasing_help_budget_2500_usd_usa/,"Purchasing Help - Budget $2500 USD, USA","Looking for a new laptop and could use help deciding. I'm willing to pay more for something I don't have to replace within the next five years, and if I'm using it everyday would rather be something I find useful and comfortable.   
Even though I heard great things, not really interested in a Mac because I personally don't care for MacOs.

My needs:

**powerful mixed-use laptop**

* be able to use it for work, school (starting grad school), and personal use
* Needs to be able to run multiple programs and browser tabs at once 
   * Researching for my papers ( I have like 3 windows of like 10 tabs open everytime I write a paper)
   * compatible with the entire Microsoft office and adobe suite
   * I tend to use adobe acrobat pro and sometimes publisher. 
   * Very rarely I'll use lightroom - probably once every two months?
   * occasionally will run light gaming programs or install messaging apps on it (messenger, Instagram, whatapp, discord, not dropping games bc I'm embarrassed)

**Decent battery life**

* With my usage type, I don't expect it to last an absurd amount, but being able last through classes and work before needing a charge at home or when doing homework

**High-quality display**

* On my last laptop XPS 13 9300 I did opt for the 4k display so I'm kind of used it it 
* I tend to watch a lot of TV shows or movies on my laptop and occasionally do some hobby editing so display and color accuracy is important to me

**BIFL.. or as close as you can get**

* not really into replacing my technologies too often
* durable 

  
Nice to have

* **15 inches or smaller** for portability (open to larger models but preferred size)
* touchscreen (not essential, would rather have a longer battery life over this)
* **webcam + mic quality** suitable for recording meetings (have an external plug in camera so the webcam isn't a dealbreaker)
* **repairability** (Can replace parts as needed, again not really a dealbreaker but would be nice)
* **large storage capacity** (prefer to not have to carry around an extra SSD or hhd)

Apologies if this is vague; I haven't really kept up with laptops or used another laptop in so long that I'm not sure what information would be helpful or what's out there.   
  
I'm not a brand loyalist and any suggestions would be appreciated. 

**Previous laptop:** Dell XPS 13 9300 (used during 2020–2025). I liked the display and overall performance, especially considering how heavily I used it. That said, it had issues with overheating from the start, and even after a battery replacement, it never quite ran the same.  However, it barely survived sitting in a coffee spill for a few hours by my s.o. about six months ago, so performance issues can’t be blamed entirely on age.

1lvy648,https://www.reddit.com/r/piercing/comments/1lvy648/new_piercing_littletono_info/,"New Piercing, Little-to-No Info.","Hey so this is going to sound all over the place and confusing... because I am.. but honestly I have no idea what course of action to take and honestly finding a direct answer for my situation is stressful to say the least 😭. 

So, my piercer kinda sucked I'm guessing? (I didn't tip at the time since I only had exact cash on me, and felt like scum of the earth in the moment; but the more I go on, the less and less I think it would've been worth it..) Like in the moment it was fine, he was nice. Got it pierced June 10th 2025 btw, so 4 weeks and 1 day ago as of this post. Although I will say the vibes him and the other guy were giving were definitely like trying to persuade me to get a piercing and FAST so I couldn't rethink it, which was kinda odd. Like I was standing outside the shop too and the other guy came out and was like ""You're getting a piercingggg...??"" (When I say it was fast i literally mean it, the whole thing took a total of like 15 minutes, genuinely. Also to clarify, they didn't 'manipulate' me into getting a piercing in any way! I had always wanted my ears pierced, had just graduated HS, so I had money, and we were walking past a tattoo and piercing shop in the city. [It was also a double lobe piercing for $100, the exact amount I had literally JUST been given over Venmo.] That's when I stopped in a store and decided to backtrack and made the VERY MUCH IN A HEAT OF THE MOMENT decision to finally do it, right there.) Sorry I know this is off topic, I have ADHD; I can't keep one cohesive thought to save my life. So then they had me do a form on my phone, and at that moment a maybe mid-teen(?) girl came in with her dad and were talking about an ear piercing she got either a week month before this having some issue of some kind, but it sounded like it was personal enough to her that it wasn't anything to do with the shop. Then we sat and the piercer guy did the piercings with a needle in both lobes. Like I said, he was kind and also very precise, made sure I liked the locations, asked if I was okay after the first piercing and after (I'm guessing cuz I said I hadn't gotten a piercing before on the form, but also get faint from them due to a... embarrassing PREVIOUS heat of the moment choice to pierce my ears at home a couple years prior, where I got light headed and eventually stopped.) and yeah all that was totally fine, that's not where I think these guys mayyy have sucked. It's after.

So like I said, this was VERY irrational, didn't do any research or anything till after so i didn't know much going in, or what they're supposed to do. The issue comes in when I simply checked out and they wished me a good day and a goodbye as I left. No; they didn't tell me any date to come back. No; they didn't say a word about aftercare, or provide anything for it. No; they didn't tell me any safety precautions or healing tips. No; they didn't tell me about downsizing. They didn't say a single word. All I did was get my ears pierced and left as if it was a haircut or even a coffee. I didn't know this was odd, and I also didn't know what to ask even if I did. 

I of course ended up having to do a lot of my own research, like getting Ocean saline spray, not touching it, spinning it, cleaning it a couple times a day (which I found out FOUR DAYS LATER... luckily it didn't get infected somehow, thank god. I was so worried after that.) etc. But also... I'm still kinda lost. I literally feel like a kid lost in a grocery store where time is ticking and everyone knows what they're doing with it except me </3. Literally only found out about downsizing... TODAY. Right before this post. That's why I'm writing it actually. The place I got it done is probably like 2 hours from me, and they gave me no recourses to help it, I'm assuming since they also sold an aftercare set separately. I'm at the 4 week mark, and it says within the next two weeks I need to get it downsized, whatever that is, at my piercer, but I can't do that? I mean I'll be up there like August 20th, but that's beyond 8 weeks at that point. I need help cuz I'm kinda overwhelmed and confused and don't know what to do...

Am I even able to go to a separate piercing place to look at or ""downsize"" my piercing if they aren't the ones who did it? Does downsizing mean I switch earrings to a normal one from a store? Do I even go to a place for that?? How much is it? Do I have to switch piercings from the initial ones and buy new ones? Like I seriously need someone to just hold my hand and give me a simple list/timeline of when to do anything that may be crucial to know and do, and how to go about doing it 'easily'. I think it's a barbell piercing? Idk they didn't tell me anything about it. It's silver and it's a tiny ball and a bar and plate in/on the back/other side. It doesn't hurt or anything so I don't know if I should even downsize yet since it's just chilling but I seriously have no clue. Please please please send your guidance since I'm so lost and everything online makes me so completely overwhelmed and stressed. 😭🖤

Thought I'd give a few responses.

*Boomer complains trouble sleeping. She drinks coffee late at night and stays on her phone until 2 am. Have suggested to not drink coffee so late and turn things off early. Nope.

*Boomer complains of stomach issues, always going to the bathroom. Well she had her gallbladder removed a few years back but refuses to focus on better eating - instead foods with heavy oils (olive oil) or fried foods. Have suggested better eating...nope. 

*Boomers refuse to pay any hookup fees for telephone or internet service instead tells them that their daughter/son can do it. Like who are we ?!?! We're not IT. 

*Boomer had cataract surgery 7 years ago and is starting to hit curbs when driving. I asked when last eye appointment? 7 years ago. I've told Boomer every day to set up eye appointment. Nope.

1lvy229,https://www.reddit.com/r/TerranStories/comments/1lvy229/the_first_wake/,The first wake,"The First Wake – As Witnessed by a Voranii

They called themselves the Voranii. A species of crystalline intelligence, shaped by millennia in the methane-glass fields of the planet Iirak. To them, death was a shedding. When a Voranii expired—when their core-light dimmed—they fractured their own shell and allowed their remains to be returned to the creches.

There were no tears. There was no mourning.

There was only the echo of legacy: a sharp pulse of memory uploaded to the Archive, to be filed, studied, perhaps admired. It was logical. Efficient. It had been enough.

Until Lirae died.

Lirae had been… different. A diplomat posted to Earth Station IX, assigned to the Terran Liaison Corps. She was fascinated by humans. Not their technology, not their clumsy organic frames or their erratic politics—but their hearts. She spent hours with them, asking odd questions about sadness, about music, about something they called “coffee.”

She even laughed—a strange, tinkling resonance that made other Voranii uncomfortable.

And then, quite suddenly, Lirae was gone.

A reactor breach. Contained, but too late for her.

According to Voranii custom, her shell was gathered, cataloged, and transported back to Iirak. A standard record was submitted to the Archive.

And that would have been the end.

But the humans held a wake.

The invitation arrived encoded in a Terran dialect. It was addressed to the Voranii delegation, with time, location, and a simple message:

“We will remember Lirae. You are welcome to join us.”

They debated attending. It was… absurd. The dead were dead. They could not be honored further than factual remembrance.

Still, curiosity lingered.

And so, Representative Valik, eldest of the Iirak Core Cluster, attended.

The room was dimmed. Music played—not the mathematical harmonies of Voranii tonecraft, but something soft and human. Strings and breath and rhythm, imperfect and alive. Valik sat near the back, his smooth exterior refracting candlelight in pale reds and blues.

One by one, the humans stood.

They told stories.

Of how Lirae had once gotten lost in the hydroponics garden and refused to call for help because she was “having too much fun mapping moss.”
Of how she once took over a diplomatic reception just to give a spontaneous presentation on the molecular beauty of snowflakes.
Of how she would tilt her crystalline head when confused by sarcasm—but never stopped trying to learn it.

They laughed. They cried.

One human read something called a poem. Another played something called a violin. At the end, they raised cups—not to forget, but to remember.

Valik had no tear ducts. No lungs to sigh. No chest to ache.

But something cracked inside him—gently, like a crystal split along a fault line, not in pain but in awakening.

Later, Valik returned to Iirak with a full memory-recording of the event.

He did something no Voranii had ever done.

He placed it—not in the archives—but in a chamber of reflection.

And above the entryway, engraved in Old Voranii, was a human phrase:

“We will remember.”

## key Features Analysis

The selection process for these top picks involved rigorous testing and evaluation based on several key features.**Coffee Bean Origin and Roast:** The origin of the coffee bean substantially impacts its flavor profile. We focused on beans from renowned regions like Ethiopia, Colombia, and Sumatra.The roast level, ranging from light to dark, influences the acidity, body, and overall taste. Light roasts retain more of the bean's natural characteristics, while dark roasts offer a bolder, smokier flavor.

**Candle Scent and wax Type:** The scent of a candle should complement the coffee's aroma, creating a harmonious blend. We considered various scents like vanilla, sandalwood, citrus, and floral notes. The wax type,such as soy,beeswax,or paraffin,affects the candle's burn time,scent throw,and environmental impact. soy wax is a popular eco-friendly option known for its clean burn.**Burn time and Scent Throw of Candles:** Burn time indicates how long a candle will last, influencing its overall value. Scent throw refers to the candle's ability to fill a room wiht fragrance. A good candle should have a consistent scent throw throughout its burn time, without being overpowering.

**Coffee Brewing Method Compatibility:** The optimal brewing method can enhance the coffee's flavors. We considered the compatibility of each coffee bean with various brewing methods, including pour-over, French press, espresso, and drip coffee makers. Different brewing methods extract different compounds from the coffee beans, resulting in unique taste experiences.

Key features of the best coffee and candles of 2025 include:

## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions regarding the selection and usage of coffee and candles.**How do I choose the right coffee and candle pairing for my preferences?**
Consider your personal taste preferences for both coffee and scents.If you prefer bold flavors, opt for a dark roast coffee and pair it with a complementary scent like sandalwood or spice.

**What are the best practices for burning candles safely?**
always trim the candle wick to ¼ inch before each use to prevent smoking and uneven burning. Place the candle on a stable,heat-resistant surface away from flammable materials. Never leave a burning candle unattended, and keep it out of reach of children and pets.Avoid burning candles for more than four hours at a time.

**How do I store coffee beans to maintain freshness?**
Store coffee beans in an airtight container in a cool, dark, and dry place. Avoid storing them in the refrigerator or freezer, as temperature fluctuations can degrade the flavor.Purchase whole bean coffee and grind it just before brewing for the best taste.

Ello ello, my name is Lewis. I'm a 30 year old tall skinny white guy from the UK!

I wasn't sure how else to word the title. I'm on the search for a genuine friend who's interested in putting in the effort/time to get to know each other and doesn't mind endlessly chatting nonsense at any time of the day.

I've been single for a while after coming out of a 7 year relationship. I miss that close connection with someone and the intimacy of a relationship. I'm not looking for anything romantic but I am hoping to capture the friendship version of that here with you. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath. 

So here begins my search for my bestie. I understand this isn't for everyone, but is that someone you? Someone not scared of being a silly goose? Being a little clingy at times? A little excited to check your phone for the next message?

I'm like an onion. There's layers. Just try not to cry while you peel them back to discover what lays deep within. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. Same goes for my toast. Not crumpets though.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.

I came from a home where I didn’t really do anything; I was in this strange depressive state, but everything also felt like it was behind a blurry glass panel. I didn’t really feel anything. But I wasn’t alone, I had my younger sisters who kept me company.
When I moved in with my father, I was still in that weird state of not being able to get out of bed no matter how much I wanted to. I've gotten better now, but I still cry every day or feel like crying.
My father has been with his wife for three years, and he does everything with her. They go for walks, get coffee, watch movies at night, have dinners with food I don’t like (they complain if I cook something else for myself), and they go out to eat at restaurants. They're always doing things together, and I try to respect it as much as I can. But if I ask my dad to do something with me, he pretends not to hear me and either goes out with her or stays locked in the bedroom with her.
I know she talks badly about me behind my back to him. I know because my dad complains that I need to change certain things (things that happened when he wasn’t even home), and because she’s a very arrogant and cold person. But if I make a face when I find out she’s staying home instead of going to work, he looks at me like I’ve personally offended him.
I honestly feel like I’m stuck in the middle of their relationship, like I’m a burden they have to deal with (especially because my father doesn’t see me as a boy).",0,1752104311.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.5,False

Mocha and S’mores were getting along just fine. 

I had to go out of town for a bit. I came back and S’mores is skinny, and not eating as much as she used to. Mocha is completely fine. S’mores was really lethargic until I loved on her a bunch and then she started to move around more. Is she maybe just depressed because she missed me? 

I’m really worried because losing Coffee devastated and traumatized me, I was holding my piggies cold body for hours just thinking I could warm her up and back to life. Can someone tell me if I’m over reacting and she was just depressed because she missed me, or if I should take her to the vet? I don’t have a lot of extra money, but I’ll do it for her.

If you’re thinking about making a post but aren’t sure what to include - don’t worry. You’re not alone. A lot of people aren’t used to writing about themselves, especially when it comes to dating! That’s why I put together this guide to help! 

Remember, the goal here is to share a little about yourself so people can get a sense of who you are before starting a conversation. Think of it as a dating profile, but with more personality and intention. 

🧠 Some Things You Could Include in Your Post: 
🎨 Basic Info (whatever you’re comfortable sharing):
- Age 
- Gender/orientation 
- Location (Stamford, nearby, willing to travel?) 
- Relationship goals (casual, serious, etc) 

⏰ Core Values/Beliefs: 
- Do you want kids someday?

- How you like to spend your weekends 
- Favorite kinds of dates? (Coffee, live music, food?)

💬 Fun Icebreakers (optional, but they help :)!) 
- An unpopular opinion you have 
- Something you will never shut up about 
- A green flag you’re proud of 
- A song, book, or movie that “gets” you 
- Something super unhinged about you, or about something you know 

📸 Photos/Socials (optional): 
- You can include a picture, but no pressure! 
- If you’re not comfortable posting one, people may ask via DM if you connect later 

You don’t have to answer all of these - just pick what feels true to you (or go off book!). A great post doesn’t need to be long or fancy. The most important thing is honesty. Be you. 

💞 And don’t forget: if you see a post that resonates, message that person! This is your sign to stop waiting for something to happen and make it happen. 

We’re just getting started here, and your post could be the one that helps someone else feel brave enough to post too.

Chapter 1: Early Life

Prince Silver Spoon was born on November 16th, 2008 at 12:08AM. He was 5.4lbs. He was heir to the throne of the Silver Kingdom. His parents were Queen Rose and King Richard. His siblings were Golden Spoon *(his older brother)* and Rose Gold Spoon *(his younger sister).*  



Silver was born a few years before the war between the Silver and Amethyst Kingdom came to an end. They fought for many years, due to the Silver Kingdom wanting the Amethyst’s power. Nobody ended up winning, but the rivalry continued, just without the war and fighting. Some locations and stores in the Silver Kingdom's famous cities were ‘Anti-Amethyst’ and did not allow anyone who was from the Amethyst Region to go inside or visit them. Richard and Rose tried to bring peace between the two kingdoms during their short reign, but failed to fully succeed. 



The Silver Region mostly spoke French and English. It was also well known for its city life and weather. The climate conditions in this area were always cloudy. The region had its fair share of rain showers. The cloudy weather gave the city its charm. It looked similar to New York and some cities in the UK. Silver’s family would often make fortnightly trips to the Silver Kingdom City, where they would go shopping, visit cool places, and go to events. 



	Richard and Rose wanted to make their children’s childhoods as memorable, loving, and happy as possible, like a normal family. From making sure they didn’t have to go through the pressure of always being in the public eye, to doing fun activities with them. They read books to them about any question they had. They had answers to everything all the time and always listened.



 He and his siblings were mostly raised away from the paparazzi, so that they could live a normal childhood, despite their importance. He was very energetic and playful as a young boy, and he liked the summertime and liked playing outside. The family went on various adventures and vacations and loved the beach. His parents were liked by their subjects and brought peace after the war with the Amethyst Kingdom. 



During royal events and visits, the couple advised everyone not to surround the children and take pictures and all of that, as this would overwhelm them and make them grow up to not want to go out as much, in fear of just being surrounded all the time by paparazzi and not getting to properly enjoy themselves. 



He loved making pillow forts with his siblings on rainy days, and playing board games during their weekly Family Nights where instead of going to bed or watching TV in their own rooms after dinner, they would sit together and play board games varying from Uno to Charades, eating ice cream, and watching movies with the best popcorn. They did this as a way to bond with each other, and it was fun.  Another normal thing Silver experienced was that he used to go to a public preschool as a child. He was homeschooled for the rest of his life, but this gave him a chance to socialize with peers who aren’t royals and are ‘normal’.



Silver had a childhood friend named Baguette. Rose and Richard wanted him to make a friend that was outside of the kingdom, so they had a genius idea. They gave him two cookies, went to the local playground during the afternoon on a cloudy day, and told him to give one to another kid and ask them to be friends. Silver followed their instructions and found his new best friend. Since then, they had playdates every Wednesday at the Silver Palace. They always watched Barney together, and played with each other. They also loved watching and observing insects, and kept a pet ant for a few hours. They were devastated when it crawled out of the cup and went missing.



Silver’s childhood consisted of many normal activities and experiences, like learning how to ride a bike, playing pretend, and drawing photos that would be hung up on the fridge after being shown to his parents. Richard and Rose’s favorite drawing he made was a drawing of his family. It was drawn in crayons, and the couple almost cried tears of love when they saw it, and it was one of the 5 drawings on the fridge, which are held up by alphabet letter magnets. 



The other drawings are rumored to be a picture of Silver Spoon playing with his siblings outside, him and his best friend, a photo of his biggest blanket fort he made with his siblings, and a picture of him as a mermaid which was the last photo they hung up.

  


King Richard and Queen Rose loved photography and the idea of  lasting memories. They kept a scrapbook with images they took from their analog cameras during vacations and other special occasions. As mentioned before, they also had a Nintendo Wii that was very important to them, as it held photos and videos from special events. They were a very modern royal family, and targeted to be as ‘normal’ as possible. The other kingdoms aimed to do this too, but it was mostly the Silver kingdom that wanted to achieve some level of normality and not have every grocery store visit be on the front of a magazine.

  


Chapter 2: Tragedy



One fateful day, King Richard and Queen Rose went into their backyard to go swimming. The servants didn’t treat the pool correctly, so there were microscopic, brain-eating amoeba inside. They decided to go swimming alone, as a break away from their children. The day after they went swimming *(August 17th, 2012)*, they felt unusually ill and had a fever, felt nauseous and were very sensitive to lights. They both thought they just caught a bad cold, so they decided to go out for a walk to see if that would make them feel better.



 So at around 6:00 pm, the couple walked out, telling Silver, the only one who was downstairs watching Bubble Guppies *(his favorite show at the time)* , that they would be going out for a walk, but would be back in time for dinner. They said they love him once more, and kissed him goodbye, unknowing this would be the last time. Before they could even leave the castle grounds, they collapsed to the ground in excruciating pain. All they could see was darkness. The brain eating amoeba did enough damage to cause fatality. King Richard and Queen Rose were gone.



Silver Spoon heard the screams and groans of pain, and rushed outside, only to see them lifeless, on the brick floor. He was only 4 years old, so he was very confused and scared. Luckily, he was able to call 911, as his parents instructed him to do this if something went wrong and someone was hurt.  No longer than 3 minutes later, ambulances and police cars rushed to the scene. The flashing lights would forever scar the poor prince. His siblings, Golden Spoon and Rose Gold Spoon came downstairs to see what all of the commotion was, and they saw the same horrific scene that Silver had to witness. 



For the next few days, Richard’s Cousin, Golden Spoon and his spouse, Rose Gold Fork, took care of the children. They would be next in line for the throne, as the children were way too young. The children were very confused about the earlier situation and asked many questions, but Golden Spoon and Rose Gold Fork covered it up by saying that their parents were sick and would get better in a few days. They felt horrible telling this lie, but if they told the kids the truth, they would be heartbroken. So they decided to leave it to the other royals that were going to adopt them in a few days.



 One afternoon, the doorbell rang.  Golden Spoon answered it. Outside was King Gold Bar VI. Gold Bar was king of the Goldspire Kingdom. The other person outside was Queen Diamond. She used to rule the Goldspire Kingdom, but she divorced King Gold Bar and started ruling the Bronze Kingdom. 



Queen Diamond took Golden Spoon and Rose Gold Spoon into her car, while King Gold Bar took Silver into his. King Gold Bar chose to adopt Silver because he saw potential in him. He could see Silver being a protective, powerful, and fair king in the future. On their way to the Goldspire Kingdom, King Gold Bar said he would explain everything as soon as they got there. It was a sunny day and everything felt normal to Silver, but something felt off and King Gold Bar was awfully sad…

  


Chapter 3: Big Changes



When Silver arrived at the Goldspire Palace , King Gold Bar introduced him to his new siblings: Golden Wii Remote, his new older brother , and Crowny, (his new younger sister). One and a half hours later, after the king showed the young prince around the castle, he decided it was time to tell him the truth. After he finished explaining to the prince about what actually happened to his parents, Silver Spoon burst into tears. All he wanted was to hear their comforting voices once more. The ones that comforted him after nightmares, the ones that were always there, the ones that loved him. 



He heard their contagious laughs echo through his mind once more, leaving him in tears. He had to leave behind his best friend, as well, and all of the fun adventures they went on during their time together. He wanted to see his siblings again, but the king had to tell him that they would be residing in another kingdom forever, but would occasionally visit. Silver was devastated, hot salty tears streaming down his face as his mind raced with memories. His throat felt like it was tightening as he tried to suppress his feelings. He was normally such a happy and playful boy, so it was so heartbreaking to see him in this state.



It was getting late, so King Gold Bar made some mac and cheese for dinner. Silver lost his appetite due to hearing the devastating news, but Gold Bar encouraged him to try to eat some so he wouldn’t go to sleep hungry. He ate it and wanted to go to bed not too long after. His poor little heart couldn’t handle this tragedy. So King Gold Bar showed the prince his new quarters and put him to bed. 



At around 1:43AM, Silver went into King Gold Bar’s room while crying, saying that he had a nightmare that everyone he knew and loved suddenly disappeared and he randomly ended up in an entirely different place. These nightmares were the result of his brain trying to process all the change and strong emotions he was going through so fast. Gold Bar taught him more about the amoebas and showed him a picture of them that the doctors scanned inside Richard and Rose’s brain, and said that they were very rare and he would be safe. He reassured him that it was just a bad dream and put him back to bed.



The next morning, Golden Wii Remote woke him up just in time for breakfast. When the kids went downstairs, they ate King Gold Bar’s famous, golden, crispy waffles with chocolate chips inside. Silver loved it. It made him feel better after what he had to hear yesterday. After he finished his breakfast, Golden Wii Remote played Mario Kart Wii with him. It was Golden Wii Remote’s comfort game, and it made him feel comfortable during tough times. 



After that, Crowny showed Silver her photography skills on her DSi, which made him a little bittersweet, knowing his parents used to love photography. They played together and went on so many ‘adventures’ until around 7:00 PM, when King Gold Bar treated them all to ice cream. Once they got back, they watched Finding Nemo to kind of make Silver feel at home, while King Gold Bar had a fight over text with Queen Diamond. This happened quite frequently after the divorce, but Gold Bar was good at hiding it from his children.



Later that night, before Silver fell asleep, King Gold Bar knocked gently on his bedroom door. Silver let him in, and he sat on the edge of his bed.



“Are you feeling okay?” King Gold Bar asked.



“A little better.. Better than yesterday..” Silver said with a twinge of sadness in his voice.



“Do you like your new siblings?” Gold Bar asked another question.



“Yeah, they’re awesome!” Silver answered.



“Just know that you can talk to me if you feel sad, and that your feelings are valid and you can cry if you need to. Crying does not make you weaker, don’t listen to the press that says otherwise.” King Gold Bar said in a comforting voice, as Silver began to sob into his arms.



 King Gold Bar cried with him, he couldn’t hold back his tears and stay strong for Silver anymore. Silver didn’t want to sleep alone. So King Gold Bar offered to sleep in Silver’s bed with him for the next few nights, as he needed to get used to the feeling of his own bed at some point.



	The next day was the funeral. Silver couldn't hold back his tears for the paparazzi and press anymore. He listened to his fathers advice and let it out. He cried and cried, getting worse as he heard people read their eulogies, and being reminded about how loved they were, how loving and kind they were, and how much everyone missed them. He almost passed out, seeing their blank expression in the open coffin and hearing their contagious laughter and their final cries for help echo through his mind, along with a final “We love you, Silver”, the last words they said to him. His crying reached a crescendo as he had to watch the burial. 



His older brother stayed strong, only letting out a few tears, and Rose Gold Spoon was too young to understand what was going on, but she kind of got the impression that something bad was happening. But Silver had it the worst, because although Richard and Rose never directly said it, he was obviously their favorite child. Everyone from all different kingdoms, even the Amethyst Kingdom, tried to make him feel better by showering him with gifts, love and just anything to make him feel better. He cheered up a few days later, when King Gold Bar took him and his new siblings to the amusement park. 

  


Chapter 4: Adjustments



It took some time, but Silver Spoon would get used to his new life. He got along very well with his new siblings, and the king treated him like his own son. Golden Wii Remote taught Silver how to play his favorite video games and introduced him to many other games. He enjoyed getting into pillow fights with his siblings, and taking photos of random objects and areas around the castle with his younger sister. They also liked going to the mini shop area behind the large staircase. It is best described as looking similar to the shops in hotels. This area consisted of a gift shop, coffee area, diner,  Even though he was less nervous and sad than when he first moved into the palace, he would still continue to have disturbing nightmares for the first two months, and King Gold Bar would continue to do check-ins with him each night for a while after the funeral, to see if he was doing okay after having to deal with all that tragedy at such a young age, and still be followed around by ignorant paparazzi who shoved cameras in his face and only cared about taking the next photo for likes. Silver was not used to this many people surrounding him, and he really didn’t like going out in public, but he got over it as he grew up.



These nightmares would be very disturbing and he would have to sleep in King Gold Bar’s room multiple times. These nightmares included him drowning, falling quickly to the bottom of the sea, hearing his parents laugh while a tsunami filled with amoebas took him away and he looked back at the shore from the water as he left behind everything from his old life. He also began having nightmares where he would see weird microbes that looked like the brain eating amoeba, and some other weird, messed up stuff that stuck with him for the rest of his life. These nightmares looked similar to the vocaloid artist, Kikuo’s [popular music videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFGrpQy0YE&list=PLlKgo8f0CEPPErkypoWOOxahPrN5bceqD&index=8&pp=iAQB8AUB). Abstract, yet bone-chilling. Think of the song ‘Don’t look at me in that way’ by Kikuo. He would always wake up sweating, crying and scared after these nightmares occurred.



Later on in life, during an interview with the press about his early life, he described one of his most traumatic nightmares. He was in his old playroom, while he frequently saw ghosts of his late parents. The ghosts were still, slightly transparent and partially grayscale. Not moving or anything, just standing there, smiling at him, watching him play with his favorite toy. They suddenly blew away, like dust with the wind. He also saw many abstract shapes that looked like they belonged in the Silver Kingdom museum. His nightmare briefly cut to a spinning music box that was underwater with fast spinning star shaped flowers that looked similar to the flowers in the sky from Spongebob, but drawn in crayons. He heard music that felt a lot like it was from the Silver Kingdom throughout the entire dream, hearing instruments like the accordion, tubas, ect. He heard the traumatic, terrifying screams of pain echo throughout the dark, cloudy city as he ran endlessly from an amoeba that got closer to him with every passing second. It cut into a scene with a variety of abstract pieces, shapes and backgrounds as he turned into one of the flowers. Then he woke up, sweating and crying. He felt empty, knowing he wouldn’t get the same loving comfort from his parents. He would still be comforted, but it didn’t feel the same. He later saw a song made by Kikuo that greatly resembled this nightmare, and then the nightmares came back for a short amount of time, but we’ll get to that later.



Five months after his move to Goldspire, he was crowned as Prince of Goldspire, replacing his brother, Golden Wii Remote who probably wouldn't make as good decisions and ideas as his brother *(for example, Golden Wii Remote was dead serious about banning all XBox and PlayStation consoles if he becomes King, even as he got older)*. Surprisingly, Goldie was not upset about this change in role, and was actually glad, because he felt stressed about the pressure of becoming a future king. He was also diagnosed with ADHD around age 7. King Gold Bar saw a lot of the signs, such as him not being able to sit still during the other royals’ speeches and quiet events, and other obvious signs. He also found out that Silver Spoon had a bad reaction to cold weather and snow, and got *terribly* sick during the winter if he was not warm enough. Not just a common cold, he would get a fever, an ear infection, and other extreme symptoms just hours after being exposed to freezing temperatures. He was also allergic to cats and pollen.



Each year, during the last week of April, and the second week of July, the Goldspire Kingdom went on a two-week trip to Superstar, which is a country that is also ruled by the Goldspire Kingdom. They always stayed at a special hotel, which has an entire floor reserved only for them throughout the year. During this time, they made trips to the local beach, theme park, and other fun spots. They also made guest appearances at IHop, too.



This was started around 1990 because they thought this would be helpful to give the royals a break and avoid stress and cause other mental issues, to not repeat the history of their ancestors. The other kingdoms have this scheduled annually as well, but on different weeks and months to avoid unnecessary conflicts with the other kingdoms. For example, the Amethyst Kingdom and the Silver Kingdom’s vacation days were on completely different months, but the Amethyst vacation was at the same time as the Goldspire’s due to the two kingdoms being allies.



Chapter 5: Growing Up

As he grew up, Silver grew a larger ego, though he still retained his playfulness and mischievous qualities. In terms of personality, young Silver was still the same as he always was. He loved being loved and showered with affection. He developed a fear of bodies of water not too long after the incident and refused to swim in any pools or lakes, no matter how clean they were. He had also developed a fear of thunderstorms, though it is unknown why. He also began to hyperfixate over the childrens’ show ‘Ben and Holly’s Little Kingdom’ for the next year and a half. He watched all 104 of the episodes, and he even created a Youtube Channel where he and his younger sister made roleplay videos where they would go on ‘adventures’ around the castle grounds. This obsession got so crazy and out of hand, that Golden Wii Remote read him a creepypasta he found online about the show that was sure to get him to stop liking it.



Silver was quite the wild child during most of his childhood *(ages 5-9 years old)*. He was very energetic and still loved anything to do with the outdoors. His favorite games to play were tag, capture the flag, football, and hide and seek. He also really enjoyed going to amusement parks during the summer and the thrill of the roller coasters. With his love for the outdoors and being active, he was also prone to more injuries. He got stung by a honey bee when he decided to hide in a tree while running from Golden Wii Remote during a game. He even broke his arm when he was nine years old, because he was playing tag with Golden Wii Remote and fell on his arm, shattering it. He also got a bloody nose and broke his leg after falling from a staircase. He needed crutches. In a recent interview, Silver said he hated crutches and they were the most uncomfortable things ever and he hated every second of it. He needed to be carried down the stairs, and he felt so restricted, bored, and sad.



Royal children were not allowed to be at ballroom events after they turned 18 months old, up until they turned 8 years old. This rule was put in place to reduce chaos and give ballrooms their charm and class. During his first ball, when he was playing tag with Golden Spoon and Golden Wii Remote, he accidentally bumped into Hourglass, a member of the Silver Kingdom. The bump caused her to spill something on her favorite dress. 



She scolded him and lectured on for nearly an hour, talking about her personal experiences about how she was disciplined for making simple mistakes as a child and how careless children were. She talked and talked, until she stormed upstairs to change her dress. Silver began to cry a little, feeling horrible about what he did. Hourglass saw him crying after  coming back downstairs, she handed him some candy and apologized for being so harsh. It was revealed in a later interview that she was facing issues with her significant other, 

 

The Goldspire kingdom holds a lot of special events and other activities, especially during the spring and summer. They have 5 days of  ‘Game Days’ each week throughout April. Game days are similar to Field Days in elementary schools that are held towards the end of the school year or. These were accompanied by movie nights or gaming later in the evening . They also have ‘Fun Nights’, where every Saturday night from 7:00PM to 10:30PM throughout March and April, there was a party in the Goldspire Palace’s spacey basement. There’s food, bouncy houses, music, and other fun activities. Silver had tons of fun participating in these events. His favorite Game Day activity was Capture The Flag. Fans remember Silver juking out *(making a sudden, deceptive move—usually in sports—to fake out an opponent and get past them.)* Brooklyn, causing her to fall to the ground as he took her flag. Some people called it 



When he turned eight years old, he and his family, and the other kingdoms, excluding the Amethyst Kingdom, due to not wanting to interact with the Silver Kingdom, had to partake in a special event called ‘Story Month’ where they would act out classic tales and some new ideas that they could suggest. These plays took place in the palace’s theater room, where anyone could visit and watch. Because there was no possible way to memorize and practice a 30-40 minute play before 11:00 AM, they had to use a special chip that inputted the ideas in their brains so they could automatically just do their parts without practice, because it normally takes 50 hours of rehearsing for just one play. Silver loved participating in these and always had large roles, with his favorite being the Forest Adventure duology, where he got to have butterfly wings and fly around in part two. But one play traumatized him. He had to play The Giant from Jack and the beanstalk. His part and what he had to do in this particular play was so embarrassing and cringe-worthy, that immediately after he got out of costume, he ran up to his room and stayed in bed for the rest of the day while crying. He even chose not to participate in the play the following day. 



He also got seriously injured during the ‘Mario’ Play where he acted as Luigi because Golden Wii Remote *pleaded* to be Mario, and then he fell on a Brick. The brick was made out of plastic mixed with some concrete, so it would obviously hurt a lot. A lot. After this play was over, he was in a lot of pain and had to go to the emergency room that was located in the Goldspire Palace to see if he would be okay. He was advised to avoid a lot of  physical movement, but continued to play in the shows.

  


Chapter 6: Scissors



When Silver was 10 years old, he met Scissors from the Bronze Kingdom. They met during the late-August ballroom dance. They agreed to dance with each other for attention, and to appear on headlines and make the press go crazy. But they developed feelings for each other not too long after they danced. So they began dating. Scissors visited Silver at the Goldspire Palace every Thursday. During these dates, they would play video games together, watch Youtube, or follow the others, mostly Golden Wii Remote, to a store or any other place they were going to. Their favorite places to go included: The trampoline park, arcade, amusement park, beach, and shops. 



The relationship was going smoothly for the first 5 months and they were both very happy in the relationship, but things got rocky after that. They began getting into arguments, fighting, and just disagreeing with each other all the time. These arguments gradually got worse. Silver began to dread Scissors’ visits on Thursdays. Their most infamous argument  was in public, when they followed Golden Wii Remote to Target. Silver told Scissors that  Coca-Cola is better than Pepsi. She heavily disagreed, and so they got into a loud argument in the middle of the store. The following Thursday, Scissors broke up with Silver after a screaming match in the Goldspire Palace because he ate the last slice of pizza they were sharing. He went back to his room for the remainder of the time Scissors was there, while Scissors just sat in the living room, watching Youtube.  He was in tears for the entirety of  the next day, and he continuously stated that he will never date again. King Gold Bar and Golden Wii Remote both laughed at him when he said this, knowing he would forget about the breakup in a month, and he’d most likely date again in a few years.



It was later revealed by Scissors in an interview she had subsequently a few years after the relationship, that she was diagnosed with RSD *(Rejection Sensitivity Disorder)*, and got very offended by some things Silver would say, even though he didn’t mean or want to be rude, leading to most, if not all of the arguments and disagreements that soon led to their breakup. 



Chapter 7: Teenage Years



Fast forward to when Silver Spoon became a teenager. He became way more mature, he began making speeches at events, and helping out in his community more. He also gained a lot more interests and found more things he likes. For example, his favorite coffee from Starbucks, his favorite artist being Odetari, ect. 



He also had to learn a lot more things from King Gold Bar just in case something happened with Goldspire and the Silver kingdom because, because the Silver kingdom was upset with them for being allies with the Amethyst Kingdom, and the Silver Kingdom was always looking for problems ever since Golden Spoon and Rose Gold Fork took the crown.



Although he was mature, he managed to get  banned from a section of Kohls’ for horsing around with his friend, Paintbrush. Surprisingly, Gold Bar wasn't phased by this, laughed it off, and told Silver that he was just being a kid, but to never do it again in order to keep a good, regal reputation. During this time, he also started up a livestreaming hobby where he would play video games while recording himself for fans to watch. Livestreaming made him even more popular with the press and paparazzi. 



He also started going through a course called ‘Prince Training’ where King Gold Bar teaches him how to become a good king so that he’s prepared for the future. These courses included many skills, lessons  and strategies to help him become as successful and powerful as King Gold Bar and his ancestors, such as: Sword Training, Defending, and other useful stuff that will keep Goldspire standing strong during his reign.



Chapter 8: Candle



He met Candle during one of his visits to an organization. Candle was beautiful, and she had such a calming voice. So Silver asked her out, she instantly accepted and then they began dating. But he needed special permission from the king, because she wasn’t a royal from the other kingdoms, but this rule was lifted not too long after. King Gold Bar approved of the relationship, and  she was given her own room in the palace. Silver and Candle liked watching anime, eating noodles, and going to the mall together. This relationship was really stable compared to his previous one. But one day, Silver said something out of pocket as a joke *(think dark humor)* and Candle slapped him across the face loud enough for everyone in the food court to hear. They all turned their attention to Silver, and victimized Candle. Silver was hated globally for the entire week, he was on the front of negative news pages everywhere, headlines of news stations and social media while everyone supported and gave attention to Candle, until the mall’s surveillance camera footage was leaked, showing Silver as the victim. Candle did this to get  attention from the paparazzi that she lacked and she was actually using Silver Spoon as a way to become popular. She changed her ways later on in life and apologized to Silver multiple times, trying to reconcile with him, but Silver refused to get back together and told her how badly she impacted his life.



The following Monday, Silver broke up with her for possibly ruining his reputation, mainly because reputation is crucial to an heir to the throne. They also began getting into a few arguments over little things that gradually turned into personal flaws a few weeks prior to the incident, and Silver didn't want a repeat of his relationship with Scissors.



Chapter 9: Falling..



Unlike his breakup with Scissors, this breakup left a great impact on Silver’s mental health. He fell into a deep depression and began waking up in the afternoons, not eating meals sometimes, and acting completely opposite to his normal self. He began isolating himself more and more from his family. He was a complete wreck: He was lonely, he had no friends, half of his fans who used to admire him now hated him for something he didn’t even do, and now he is a hot mess who can’t even get out of bed.



He did find joy in PC gaming, though. His favorite game was Minecraft. He spent his days making his world, it was an escape from his everyday duties and lifestyle. He also began making more variety content. His days became way more repetitive during this depressive state: Wake up, eat breakfast, go back to bed unless there was an event or he had duties, livestream, eat, go back to sleep. He also lost a lot of his energetic personality, and became more serious. It took him a while to get back on his feet and feel better mentally and emotionally.



One day, he transferred his channel from Twitch, to a new livestreaming app called ‘Brookly’, which was programmed by the Princess of Amethyst Kingdom, Princess Brooklyn. He was rivals with Brooklyn from a young age, so he would sometimes make cameos in her livestreams and troll in the comments. This would make Brooklyn extremely mad, but in a joking manner, as she found this funny. 

  


Chapter 10: Brooklyn



On Wednesday, August 2nd of 2023, Silver Spoon DM’d Princess Brooklyn, requesting to do a collaboration with her on Saturday. She agreed and they planned a time, topic, and all the other things. He decided it would be easier to just stay at the Amethyst Palace overnight rather than just traveling all in one day and being exhausted. So on Friday night, he packed to stay over and then went to bed early so he could wake up in the morning. 



On August 5th, he woke up, and got ready for the meet-up. After breakfast was over, he was driven to the Amethyst Kingdom by King Gold Bar. When he arrived at the door, he rang the doorbell. Brooklyn’s brother answered. He told him that Brooklyn had a migraine and might not be able to livestream today. Then he came inside, put his backpack on the ground and approached her.



She was covered inside a blanket, shielding her eyes from the bright, painful lighting in the living room. Silver knew that Brooklyn couldn’t handle bright lights due to remembering her getting sensory overloads during Fun Night events when he was younger, so he turned them down for her. 



Brooklyn told Silver to sit beside her. They made plans for the livestream for the next 10 minutes, and then Silver followed Brooklyn to her special livestreaming room. They made their first livestream that lasted 2 hours and 19 minutes. They had a lot of fun, laughter and joy was shared between the two streamers. After their livestream,  Silver asked her out. Brooklyn was hesitant at first, due to her last relationship being toxic and traumatic, but she said yes. They spent the rest of the day talking and getting to know each other, and then they watched a movie with everyone else later that night. Before he went to sleep in one of the surprisingly comfortable guest rooms, Silver video called King Gold Bar, telling him he would be staying a little longer for the Canobie visit, and that he was now dating Brooklyn.



The next day, everyone from the Amethyst Kingdom went to their annual Canobie Lake Park visit, and Silver got to go with them. Everyone had a great time, and Silver got to learn a lot about Brooklyn, because he only saw her during visits when he was younger, so he only knew so much about her before the meeting.

  
  


  
Ran out of space but I'm on chapter 17",1,1752103643.0,SilverSpoonfans,0,1.0,False
1lvxnpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1lvxnpo/review_3_special_orders_7_regulars_from_sorce/,Review: 3 Special Orders + 7 Regulars from Sorce,"Hello, it's me! I'm back and sniffing my way through the Sorce catalog because it's not going to sniff itself!

SPECIAL ORDER:

**Where the Wild Things Grow II:** I like this a lot more than the sweeter, candied Version I of this scent, but I would still classify this as a perfumer’s idea of a strawberry, closer to a lollipop than the real thing. If you are looking for a true-to-life strawberry straight from the dirt, keep looking. However, there’s just enough of a green note to make it wearable for me though, and wear it I will! For approximately 2 hours because it has nooooo longevity! You win some, you lose some. ***Notes:*** *Late spring strawberries still on the vine, vanilla cream soda, fresh green grass with morning dew, and ambrette seed. Versions I and II are the same materials, in different proportions. Where the Wild Things Grow I is sweeter and fruitier, and II is greener and earthier.* 7/10

**Between the Sheets:** For a solid 3 weeks I was sniffing this and sniffing this and getting GREEN BELL PEPPERS every time and cursing myself for the blind buy. Don’t blind buy kids! But I stayed consistent and after about a month the green bell pepper curse now lasts only 5 seconds, and then this dries into this luxurious, creamy, round, understated scent. Most of my Sorce faves up until this point have been decidedly sweet, but this is smooth and balanced and very grown up, and perhaps even unisex? I don’t know that I would’ve chosen this out of a sample set because of the green bell pepper situation, but I really like where this ended.  ***Notes:*** *Figs, cream, beeswax absolute, cashmere, wool, skin musk* 8.5/10

**UFO Disco:** Another blind buy that I really disliked at first sniff. After a month…well I still don’t like it too much. I was hoping for mango and cardamom and instead it’s like dry, peppery mango fruit leather. It is oddly…textured. Like there’s a cashmere accord hiding in there somewhere. My husband’s take is that it simply “smells odd” and that he doesn’t like it. I think it’s better as it mellows out on the dry down, but I don’t know if I love it enough to keep it. After 3 hours the vanilla musk comes through which is nice. This one might be bound for the destash pile. **Notes:** *Mango lassi sprinkled with cardamom, guava, amyris wood and a holographic vanilla musk* 5/10

REGULAR CATALOG:

**The Ghost Wants a Birthday Cake:** Oh my god, I believe the hype now. It really is like juicy peaches fresh out of the oven with a buttery cobbler note coming in on the back end. I don’t even *like* peach perfumes and my nose keeps searching for something artificial, but this is exceptionally realistic. My husband particularly likes this one and describes it as “Entenmann’s cake…with peaches.” Admittedly, this is a very sweet gourmand and just generally A Lot. The projection is A Lot. But this is objectively delicious and, as they would say on GBBO, it’s “a little triumph!” We have no choice but to stan!! I upsized this one SO fast. ***Notes***: *Warm peach cake spiced with ginger, cinnamon, and cardamom; vanilla bean ice cream, Mysore sandalwood, Australian sandalwood* 9/10

**A Party, or Something:** Yup that’s cake. It’s undeniably yellow cake with just a hint of that pistachio nuttiness. Honestly, I’m not sure I would clock the pistachio if I didn’t know the notes, but now that I know it’s there I can smell that it’s adding an earthy richness to all of the sweet fluffy cake. I can’t say the same for the marigolds, chocolate, or cashmeran - this is just pistachio cake to me! And yes, I also upsized this. ***Notes:*** *Marigolds, yellow cake, white chocolate, pistachio buttercream, Iso E Super, Cashmeran* 8.5/10

**Moon Magic:** I actually ordered this by accident, thinking that I was ordering SNOW Moon Magic, but I am soooo glad I did. This is the sweetest, cuddliest, babiest lavender  bedtime scent. I absolutely love slathering this on before bed, although I’m not sure I would wear it out and about. This is missing the strong treacly cookie dough note of Snow Moon Magic and it seems cleaner and lighter by comparison (but not verging into cleaning product territory!) I burned through my 6ml oil in 2 months and now I’m straight up rationing the last drops before I can get my hands on some more. ***Notes:*** *Lavender sugar, vanilla steamed milk, chai spices, tonka bean, Cashmeran, Ambroxan, crystals charged by the moonlight (our crystal accord)* 9/10

**Cabanilla (Freebie)**: A salty, beachy vanilla. I get the coconut, vanilla, and salt right up front but not many of the other notes. I like it! The closest match for me would be **Dirty Coconut** by Heretic. This was a freebie in an oil format and fades super quick on me and is just a bit…boring? I think if it’s going for the beachy vibe I want MOAR beach, not just a vanilla suggestion of a beach. It’s a like, not a love. Also fades pretty quickly for me.  ***Notes****: Salted vanilla, sand, palm fronds, driftwood, a cracked coconut, brown sugar, balsam of Peru, and a distant beach bonfire* 6.5/10

**A Sign Painted Peaches:** Uh oh. This is going shampoo again. Like [Venus in Fleurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1jcrt1l/sorce_yet_another_review_rec_request/), this smells almost exactly like a L’Oreal Kids shampoo from the 90’s that I associate with swim class at the YMCA. It dries down strong and powdery and I really dislike it. I don’t even know if I can smell any peach? It’s wild to me that this smells so incredibly different than The Ghost Wants a Birthday Cake. I can’t find any overlapping notes between this and Venus in Fleurs except the vanilla absolute, but this is a hard pass for me. ***Notes***: *Peach nectar, sun-warmed peach skin, saffron, gardenia, ambergris, vanilla absolute, vetiver* 3.5/10

**Light through the Clouds (Freebie)**: I get a hit of pepper in the opening, and then about 5 minutes of the mildest sugared lemon you can imagine, and then it’s…gone? Light through the clouds? More like Absolutely No Projection through the Clouds! But in all seriousness, there’s nothing that really offends here, but if you want to get serious about your sugared lemon check out **Butterfly Rabble** by Arcana Wildcraft, because this is just not worth the $$  ***Notes:*** *Sichuan pepper, sugared lemon, green mandarin, water lily, olibanum, white tea, cloud musk, ambergris, sandalwood, gurjun balsam, vetiver, golden amber* 5/10

**Falling Stars Salted Vanilla Sweet Cream**: Honestly I’m not getting much (any?) coffee. It’s sort of the watered-down Sorce base, with less cookie dough but more vanilla and cream.

1lvxlq8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lvxlq8,My 2023 Model Y rear was rear ended at a red light. Should I even pursue an insurance claim?,"About 10 days ago on June 30th, while on my way to work, I stopped for a red light at a 4-way intersection. A 2021 Toyota Tundra comes to a stop behind me but for some reason, ends up rear ending me. (I have a video of this incident too: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tvZqiukbftw?si=sU4Ljs9iXmM5eiwW). 

The initial jolt was pretty big, and I dropped my ice coffee. Anyways, I immediately get out to investigate the rear of my car. The driver is Hispanic, doesn't speak English, but I was able to hand sign to him to follow me out of this intersection so we can pull over and exchange information. This portion was a nightmare because I needed Google Translate and the area for internet reception was very poor. It was so spotty I could only manage to translate that we needed to exchange info, but I wasn't able to learn from his end why/how he hit me.

Then he departs, and I depart to work too. The same morning, I make a claim through the Tesla App and the soonest I can be seen for an appointment is now July 15th.

Now as I wait, I'm just thinking is this incident worth the whole ordeal? Paying $500 for my deductible, taking my car to the shop and maybe not having it for X number of days, coordinating with work, having an ""Accident"" reported on my VIN/Driving Record (maybe negatively affecting a future buyer's perception of my car), etc.

If I'm being honest, I suppose the damage (scuffs, nicks) don't look too bad. But my paranoid side says what if my bumper falls off in half a year, what if he damaged my frame, what if he hurt my internal electrical components/battery, etc.?

This is where I'm turning to Reddit for your insight and guidance. What should I do: Go through insurance? Or do nothing and consider it an unlucky accident? Or maybe something else?

1lvxktr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lvxktr,Advice on aging/finishing compost,"Hey all! 

Just recently finished up my first ever compost run! About one month of collecting garden and kitchen scraps without turning. About one month of turning about every 4 days while still adding kitchen scraps. About one month just leaving it alone, sifting a few shovelful here and there, turning until done. 

This was all done in a 33 gallon trash can, drainage holes on bottom and the sides, and a jute coffee bag for a cover. Used leaf litter, shredded cardboard, and a bag of wood shavings for browns. Had several day stretches on more than one occasion of over 110 degrees in the middle of the pile. Leftovers from sitting were used to start a new pile, and now I’m left with about 15 gallons of partially finished compost. It’s still fairly light in color and contains lots of partially broken down wood shavings and small twigs. 

I would like to let this compost sit until at least the fall to rest and finish breaking down and was wondering what everyone’s thoughts were on storing partially finished compost to finish. I have considered piling it up in a corner of the yard and covering with a tarp, or building another 33 gallon composter just for finishing. I also have access to basically unlimited jute coffee sacks through my job and have also considered just bagging it up and letting it sit directly on the ground until I need it.  

Any input is appreciated! Thanks in advance! ",3,1752103381.0,composting,4,1.0,False

1lvxk29,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassF/comments/1lvxk29/part_1/,Part 1,"You ever look at a room full of kids and wonder if the universe is playing a long, elaborate joke on you?

Yeah. That’s me. Every Monday through Friday at 7:45 a.m.

They call it “Class F.” F for Foundation, officially. But unofficially? F for Failure. The students no one else wanted to deal with. Powers too weak, too weird, too… useless. My job is to teach them how to maybe survive long enough to not explode or electrocute a neighbor.

Or themselves.

I sipped my coffee. Black, because hope left me years ago. Then I faced the classroom.

“Alright, let’s do this again. Introductions. Your name, and what you think your power is. Please try not to undersell yourselves this time.”

First up: Danny.

He was slouched so low in his chair, I thought he might melt into the floor. Hoodie up. One earbud in.

“My name’s Danny,” he muttered.

I waited.

“And?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

He sighed. Deeply. Theatrically.

“I can, like… give myself a nosebleed.”

A few kids snorted. Someone in the back whispered legendary. I didn’t laugh.

Instead, I leaned forward.

“On command?”

Danny blinked. “Yeah. Pretty much.”

“How?”

He shrugged. “I just sorta… think about it real hard. Then boom. Blood.”

My brain clicked.

Wait.

“Have you tried doing anything with the blood once it’s out?”

Another shrug. “Not really. Just clean it up before Mom sees.”

I stared at him. Not in judgment. In awe.

“Jesus, kid. You’re a blood manipulator. You’re sitting on a literal war crime of potential.”

Danny blinked again. “Huh.”

Next.

A girl with bright green braids and a jacket covered in band pins leaned back in her chair. “Tasha,” she said. “I can charge my phone with my hand.”

Another snicker. I didn’t join in.

“Just your phone?”

“I mean, I haven’t really tried anything else.”

“Ever held a car battery?”

She looked alarmed. “No?!”

“Good instinct,” I said. “But next time, we’re getting you gloves. You’re not a walking charger, Tasha. You’re a generator. You might be able to fry drones out of the sky if we train you right.”

Her eyes widened just a little.

Row by row, it kept happening.

Kid who thought he was useless because he could make his skin slightly bouncy?

Shock absorption. With the right focus, maybe even kinetic redirection.

The girl who could only talk to spiders?

Do you know how many spiders there are in a city? Too many. That’s surveillance on a level Homeland would cry for.

They thought they were broken.

They weren’t.

Just ignored.

Thrown into the junk drawer of the academy system.

And now?

Now they were mine.

“Alright,” I said, pacing in front of them with my coffee in one hand and the other gesturing like a lunatic conductor. “Here’s the deal. You are not weak. You are not jokes. You are… underdeveloped potential. You’re rusty knives, unsharpened arrows, loaded slingshots in a world of laser cannons. But let me be clear. You can kill a god with a slingshot if you aim it right.”

They stared.

Danny’s nose started bleeding slightly. He didn’t even look fazed.

I smiled.

“Class F. Let’s see how far we can take this.”

1lvxjxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1lvxjxi/im_worried_my_nmom_trauma_will_lead_me_to/,I'm worried my Nmom trauma will lead me to unsuspectingly date a narcissist,"Because of my mom I am literally paranoid about unsuspectingly getting into a relationship with a narcissist even though I've learned a lot in recent years about recognizing red flags. I don't know how to strike a balance between overanalyzing everything a potential partner does and being reasonably cautious. For context, I posted earlier about meeting someone I like recently and I think they're a decent person, but because of the trauma of my upbringing I keep going back and forth wondering if he's really actually nice or if it's just an act. I know what lovebombing looks like based on my mom's behavior and that of a toxic situationship of mine from several years ago (that in retrospect I got into because of my experience with my mom) so I know it's different from genuine interest. But I also have OCD so I can't stop second-guessing the interactions I've had with him so far? 

I think I just want outside reassurance that my instincts that he's a good person are correct, since if someone is ""off"" I tend to detect it pretty quickly. I haven't gotten sus vibes from him for now and so far I've felt really comfortable around him. If I give a rundown of some of our interactions so far could people weigh in on what they think? I'd really appreciate it:

-We met at church last week after bumping into each other. He was new there and asked about the service schedule. I introduced myself and we talked for a little bit, and then afterwards he asked for my number so we could keep in touch 

-I didn't hear from him until later in the week when he asked if I would be back at church again the next Sunday at the same time. I said yes so we planned to meet up again. He also asked if there were any cafes in the area where he could get coffee after, so I listed a few, and then he invited me to tag along if I wanted (which I took to be a roundabout way of asking me out without being too pushy). I said sure, so he let me pick the place. He also texted (with a smiley face) that he wanted to sit next to me in church this time since we hadn't met yet last time and were sitting in different pews 

-We met up at church again and he complimented my dress and my singing

-Afterwards he walked me to my car and then we met up again to get food. He paid for everything and then we talked for awhile while eating. He rambles a lot and sometimes interrupts when he gets really absorbed in the conversation but he has ADHD so it didn't really bother me since I'm pursuing a diagnosis myself and I'm guilty of the same conversational hiccups myself. When it was my turn to talk he was very attentive and seemed genuinely interested in learning more about me

-We then went to get ice cream where he paid again, and while we were at the ice cream place I dropped some on my shoe. He ran to get a napkin and wiped it off for me. Then we talked some more, and at the end he asked me if I wanted to meet up for a movie later in the week. I said yes, and then we left and he walked me back to my car again 

-I texted him when I got home to make sure he'd gotten home okay and then we joked around a little via text before I assume he went to sleep 

Overall he was really easy to talk to and despite the rambling he was a very good listener and pretty non-judgmental. I felt at ease with him, but I've been really unlucky in love so I guess I'm just not used to the attention? Like I'm wondering if the unfamiliarity of the feeling is making me overthink things and freak out wondering if it's an appropriate level of attention or interest or not. He hasn't texted me back about the movie yet but this is a repeat of last week where he didn't get back to me until a day or two before we were supposed to meet up again so I'm thinking he's both busy with work but also not wanting to come on too strong, which might be a good sign because he's not acting too invasive. He also let me pick the movie. He hasn't said anything too intense like how he's crazy about me or future faking or anything like that. Idk I think I'm driving myself insane with paranoia because I really didn't get any bad vibes from him and I just want to stop ruminating and worrying that I have blinders on. I really like him and I want to keep hanging out with him for now to see where it goes 

EDIT: I feel like I need to clarify some things before the discussion continues. While I respect people sharing their experiences in the replies and I am truly sorry for anyone who has experienced traumatic relationships, I do feel like some might be projecting their own experiences and trauma onto my situation. I specifically mentioned that I did NOT get bad vibes from this person whereas the comments so far seem to be implying that I did and therefore should be listening to that instinct. I reiterate: I did not, and I am also not under the impression that I ""know"" this person deeply. I felt comfortable with him but I am very cautious and still getting to know him to figure out whether he is a good person or compatible with me. I am not rushing into anything nor do I have any intention to, and I am fully aware that predatory people can hang out at churches just as much as anywhere else. I apologize if I'm coming off as defensive but while I am asking for advice, I am also not naive enough to not already know these things. I have had bad experiences with two people before this where I sensed red flags early on. One I ignored and I got very codependent until they discarded me (this was the aforementioned situationship), and the other was a future faker that I met in an online church adjacent group (so again, I'm well aware of creepy church people) that I blocked after I realized he was getting weird. I've also had an experience with an older man who tried to groom me in college that I had instant bad feelings about and also ignored for too long, who I thankfully got away from because my parents stepped in and scared him away. So I'm not going into this blind as it seems people are assuming. 

The reason I am paranoid is in large part because I have clinically diagnosed OCD as a result of my trauma and the nature of the disorder is to blow things out of proportion even when nothing is wrong. Even with extensive treatment I often have trouble distinguishing what is OCD-based paranoia and what is real, and that is what I'm seeking help with. I have already posted in an OCD-specific group but so far have not received any replies. If there is anyone who specifically has experience with navigating the nuances of clinically diagnosed OCD (not the pop psychology interpretations of it) and its related cognitive distortions and separating that from real, genuine red flags, that's the kind of response I would really appreciate.

I tend to have very strong gut instincts early on and thanks to therapy I've done a lot of work on recognizing both emotional and physical signals indicating that something is wrong and that I should guard myself. I'm familiar with how it feels when I meet someone who gives me the ""ick"" for lack of a better way of putting it, and I did not experience the same sensations during these initial interactions as I did with the aforementioned people I had bad experiences with. Like I said, with the situationship, I ignored the red flags so I've learned to pay very close attention in my interactions even with friends and compare those to what happened with that relationship and see if any of it lines up, and if it does I try to steer clear. My intention is to continue evaluating my physiological responses in further interactions and see if anything starts to flare up that feels similar to what I felt with these other people. So far nothing of the sort has happened so it may be too early to make a definitive judgment. I have also taken the precaution of sharing some of our text conversations with my friends to get their opinions because I did not want to navigate it alone, and based on their observations of the firsthand interactions they seemed to think he was normal. I am also intending to talk to an older female friend about this so at the very least she is aware that I'm seeing this person (she's sort of a surrogate mother figure and I trust her).

Again, I feel like people are assuming I haven't done any work on this and am navigating this blind so I apologize for not clarifying in the initial post. Also, re: feeling like ""home"" - what actually stuck out to me was that talking with him felt like the exact opposite of what has always been ""home"" to me and familiar. Again, not a long-term indicator but it was very different from my previous interactions with the people that turned out to be bad news. The situationship person subconsciously felt like ""home"" because their behavioral patterns in retrospect mimicked my mother's, so I know that's why I latched onto them and why I'm better at looking out for the same phenomenon again. I haven't gotten any indication of similarities in that respect yet, which is why I'm questioning whether this is actually an OCD-related problem. I get that for people without OCD experience it can be difficult to know how to respond to someone who has it so again if anybody here does have OCD or has experience with it I'd appreciate specific guidance from that angle

1lvxawp,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/1lvxawp/food_parcels/,Food parcels,"I see that Countdown is running its winter appeal, so thought I'd share my experiences with food parcels. 

I've had a few instances in the past where I've had to apply for assistance from the salvation army. They were absolutely a lifesaver, and got me through a tough time in my life. Please do tap yes to rounding up on the self checkouts. 

If the following sounds ungrateful, it's not meant to whatsoever.

If you're thinking of donating food directly, please consider donating things like margarine, yoghurt, eggs, fruit+veges, instant hot chocolate or latte satchets, flavourful cereal or oatmeal, and ready made meals e.g. tinned soups, frozen pizza or the like. (Of course alongside the usual milk powder, baked beans etc).

I say that as I don't think I've ever received margarine in a parcel. My friend says they've never gotten it either. It can be a bit tricky considering the abundance of bread that's handed out. Margarine is good as it doubles as cooking oil - I don't recall ever getting oil either.

As for the other suggestions, often when you're at the point of needing help with food it can be disheartening (let alone unhealthy) to eat plain rice with plain tuna or tinned spaghetti for every meal with the occasional chocolate biscuit thrown in, Hence me suggesting ready made meals and nutrients dense but easy to prepare/store foods. Coffee and hot chocolate because well, it's winter, they're comforting.

I'd personally have loved it to recieve a selection of ingredients to make a specific recipe, or maybe come across a little motivational letter or a funny joke hidden inside packaging (keeping hygiene in mind). 

Pet food, toiletries, and cleaning supplies are helpful as those are expensive but essential. I don't have kids but I assume baby products are also helpful. Non-food items are also amazing to be offered - I once received a big fluffy blanket which has been my favorite blanket ever since.

Basically, put yourself in the shoes of who you're donating to. You have had some big and unexpected expenses that have left you with $10 for the week. There is almost no food in the pantry. You are eating plain oats cooked with plain tinned tomatoes for every meal because you need to feed your pet before yourself. You are using hand soap to wash your hair. You are losing weight, you are running out of willpower and are barely making it through each day. You apply for a food parcel. What would make you squeal with relief and delight?

Disclaimer: I don't know how it works behind the scenes as I haven't ever volunteered at a food bank, only made and received donations. I also have only ever applied for parcels when it's just myself and my cats so I probably got the leftovers. Anything is appreciated in the end anyway.",64,1752102635.0,newzealand,23,0.89,False

I’m not a Karen. Not a Karrin, not a Keren, not a Kiera, not a Kara, and definitely not the type to ask for a manager. I usually keep it moving. But honestly, I feel like we’re all just ignoring the basic rules of society at this point.

And I’m not saying I’ve never bent one myself. I have. But some of the stuff I’ve seen lately is wild.

A guy made a full left turn at an intersection with a giant “No Left Turn” sign. Then he stared at me like I was the idiot for not slamming on my brakes.

Someone at a crosswalk hit the button so many times it looked like he was trying to stimulate the clit of a dead whale.

At the DMV, a woman answered a FaceTime call on speaker while standing under a sign that said “Quiet Please.” Like, not even pretending to care.

In the grocery store, a man brought in his dog and told the clerk, “He’s basically my child.” His “child” was licking the deli case.

A guy cut the line at the bank and said “I’m in a rush” like that was a valid ticket to skip everybody.

I saw a mom let her kid throw breadcrumbs at the ducks even though there was a big sign saying not to. The pool in the apartment complex, like we want to swim with ducks!

When the kid asked why, mom said “Because the government’s weird.” Great lesson.

A car parked in the fire lane with its hazards on. Like the blinkers made it legal.

A guy dropped his coffee cup on the ground and said “They hire people for that.” Right. And we also hire janitors for schools, but that doesn’t mean you poop in the hallway.

In the middle of a movie, a guy answered his phone and whispered, “I’m in a movie but it’s not that good.” Thanks for the update.

At the zoo, a lady hopped the fence to pet the giraffe because “he looks nice.”

In a hospital, a guy walked through a “Staff Only” door looking for snacks.

Someone yelled at a cop because their car got towed from a “No Parking” zone. Like the sign was just a polite suggestion.

A woman brought a parrot to jury duty. Said “He helps me think.” Maybe the bird should be on the jury.

At a concert, a girl blocked the fire exit because it was closer to the stage. Said, “I paid a lot for these shoes.” Priorities.

Then there was the guy who walked across a clearly labeled wet paint bench and acted like someone else ruined his pants.

At this point, it’s not just bad manners. It’s a full-on condition. I call it **Entitledism**. We’ve all got a little bit of it, but some people are out here living in it full-time free range idiot mode.

Short interest remains high, and guess what? There’s no liquidity down here. If bulls step in tomorrow — even mildly — we’re looking at a squeeze to 0.20+ just to rebalance. They’ll be scrambling for cover while we sip coffee on Mars.

Conclusion
Patience is a weapon. Let them laugh now — we’ll laugh later. When this beast wakes up, it won’t ask for permission. Tomorrow? Could be the day shorts start crying.

1lvx9qy,https://i.redd.it/3jww4lefkxbf1.jpeg,It's always the ones you least expect.,"Curonian colonisation was the colonisation efforts of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (today part of Latvia), a vassal duchy of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Small, but wealthy, the Duchy took a modest part in the European colonization settlement attempts of West Africa and the Caribbean.

In 1651, Courland and Semigallia leased a colony in Africa on St. Andrew's Island in the Gambia River from the Kingdom of Niumi[1] and went on to build Fort Jakob on the island. The Duchy also leased St. Mary Island (modern-day Banjul) from Kombo and Fort Jillifree from Niumi. The Courland and Semigallia's colonies exported sugar, tobacco, coffee, cotton, ginger, indigo, rum, cocoa, tortoise shells, as well as tropical birds and their much sought after feathers. In the end, the Duchy would manage to retain control of these lands for less than a decade and the colonies were formally ceded to England in 1664.

The colonies were lost when Courland and Semigallia's neighbours took advantage of its weakened defences during the Northern Wars, when Jakob was held captive by the Swedish Army from 1658 to 1660. After the end of the war, the island of Tobago was returned to Courland. However, the Duchy ended up abandoning the island in 1666. In 1668, a Curonian ship attempted to reoccupy Fort Jacob but was driven off by the Dutch garrison stationed on the island. The Courland Monument near Great Courland Bay commemorates the Duchy's settlements.

St. Andrews Island or Courlander Gambia was also the later British Fort James. (1651–1660, 1660–1661)

I hope there’s someone else in the same boat too, maybe. Now hear me out, when I say spending money everyday I don’t mean on massive expensive purchases, but I literally mean I can’t go a single day without spending at least a fiver or something. Like, literally. First thing when I wake up I’m thinking how I can spend money. I’ve a coffee machine at home and food but for example I’ll still make sure to go out and buy the coffee and a sandwich in the shop or something. I frequently buy things online, but it’s always smaller purchases, maybe between €15 to 60 euros or so. I use Amazon a lot and I love getting things that are on a good sale, even if I don’t necessarily need it. 

I don’t waste a lot of money on this.. or so I think, anyway. I justify it because I’m thinking ‘these purchases aren’t expensive and I could probably do with this’.

Again, I feel like it’s tricky because I’m not spending all my money. In fact, I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I had no money or under like 8k saved up. I don’t have a job with a huge salary, actually unemployed at the current moment. But I wouldn’t be able to sleep knowing I didn’t buy anything.

Am I overthinking?,"My boyfriend’s birthday was on July 7. That same day, I found out he’s still in contact with the mother of his child. I didn’t know they were talking, so it caught me off guard.

Then, on July 8, I had a dream where his ex was with us and she was clearly trying to make me jealous. It felt so real that I woke up feeling uneasy.

Fast forward to July 9, around 4 AM—I woke up and checked my phone. I noticed I didn’t receive any messages from him around midnight (which is unusual), and I started wondering what he was doing during that time.

I went back to sleep… and then I had another dream. In that dream, he told me he went out at midnight to have coffee with his ex and their two kids. I found out because I borrowed his phone and he was visibly uncomfortable, like he didn’t want me to see something. And when I looked—there it was.

Then I woke up, heart racing.

Now I can’t tell if my mind is just messing with me or if my gut is picking up something. I know it’s just a dream, but the timing and the way it all unfolded really shook me. I feel anxious and unsettled.

1lvx5cu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lvx5cu,For the pink Bincoo double-valve user who posted not long ago— it works 👍🏼 But it just has to be finessed some w/ no instructions included…,"I forgot who it was that was disappointed with trying to make this pot work right— and it definitely would help if Bincoo provided a guide with the purchase— but I already had the same pot on order when you posted, & just received it recently. (Wanted an example in my coffee nook of a cute knockoff Brikka-type double valve pot.) 
Here’s the process that worked for me twice now, though I’m still playing around to get a bit more yield of actual coffee, (not the amount of foam, which was fine & lasted several minutes after pouring into the cup):

—13.5 grams Lavazza’s Super Crema beans ground slightly courser than medium-fine;

— room temp water about a millimeter below the max-fill line etched in the bottom half of the pot;

—2 firm taps on the counter & a handful of light taps around the moka basket to level it out;

— preheated hotplate set to 2 out of 5 at first, then after an initial tiny puddle of coffee dripped out in the top before a total stoppage of flow, I turned it down to 1.5 on the hotplate dial (got scared lol, with it being a slightly higher-pressure pot & my lack of experience with 2-3 bar pots..);

— Foam started spewing suddenly, & after several seconds of gushing (with lid down) I pulled it off the heat.. & when it stopped, it was fairly abrupt— not gradually easing off.  So next time I might be braver & leave it on the heat a few seconds longer, maybe at a different level just to try to get more than about 40ish grams of coffee, which was today’s total. (Pictures not taken until after several minutes, so there was reduced foam in both the pot & then in the white cup— which is actually kind of big for a demitasse cup.) 

Was thick-bodied & smooth without a bitter edge… very nice…. 

But it overflowed for me at first, like with you.  I hope you haven’t returned it. It does work. They just really should’ve put at least a few usage guidelines on a piece of paper in the box 😏",2,1752102213.0,mokapot,2,0.75,False
