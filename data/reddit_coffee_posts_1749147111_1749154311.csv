I’m 6ft (183cm) and 85kg ish (187lbs). I’m trying to get my body fat % down to around 15%, currently around 20%.

I’ve realised that 2:1 fat ratio is necessary for me. I have struggled with depression, anxiety and chronic fatigue for almost my entire life, and this macro ratio has made me feel like a new person. 

I am however struggling to keep my calorie intake down. I’m trying to stay around 2,000 to keep the fat loss going, but I’m hitting on average between 2,500-3,000 per day. 

I do exercise heavily a few times a week but not enough to outweigh this intake. 

I know keeping my insulin low will absolutely help with fat burning. But surely calories still matter?

I’m eating around 400g 80/20 ground beef (raw weight), 4 egg yolks, 80g of butter and 4-8 tbsp of heavy cream per day in coffee etc. 

I came to this from standard carnivore, eating around 2lb of meat per day, but I don’t feel great with that much protein and too little fat as it knocks me out of ketosis. 

Any thoughts or experiences? Thank you!",1,1749154242.0,Metabolic_Psychiatry,0,1.0,False

**Food Sector Snapshot: Market Performance and Lifestyle Insights**

The food sector on June 5, 2025, presented a mixed bag of financial performance and lifestyle trends, offering a glimpse into the dynamics of both the corporate world and individual consumer behavior. Stock market data from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) painted a picture of fluctuating valuations for prominent players in the food processing and beverage industries. Simultaneously, social media and media outlets highlighted the daily routines of key figures and the rise of digital platforms for culinary engagement.

**Stock Market Performance: Britannia and Tata Consumer Products**

Two major Largecap companies, Britannia Industries and Tata Consumer Products, exhibited contrasting performances on the BSE. Britannia Industries, operating in the Food Processing & Packaging sector, closed the day at ₹5558.3. Despite intraday fluctuations, the stock demonstrated a positive one-day return of 0.27%. Over a month, Britannia's shares yielded a return of 3.72%, and a more substantial 17.75% gain was observed over the past three months. This positive trend, however, comes against the backdrop of a 52-week range that shows a significant variance, with a low of ₹4506.5 and a high of ₹6473.1, indicating the stock's susceptibility to volatility. The daily pivot level for Britannia was calculated at ₹5546.62.

In contrast, Tata Consumer Products, focusing on the Tea & Coffee sector, closed at ₹1111.95. The stock experienced a negative one-day return of -1.04%. Though the one-day performance was down, a positive trend was observed over a three-month period. The company's stock had a 16.22% return in the last three months. The stock also experienced intraday fluctuations, with a low of ₹1109 and a high of ₹1133.2. The 52-week range for Tata Consumer Products shows a low of ₹884 and a high of ₹1246.42. The daily pivot level for Tata Consumer Products was set at ₹1122.95. These financial metrics offer a glimpse into the health and dynamics of the food industry.

**Personal Wellness and Daily Routines: Sara Tendulkar's Lifestyle**

Beyond the financial aspects of the food sector, social media offered a personal perspective through Sara Tendulkar, a registered nutritionist and the daughter of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar. Her Instagram posts provided insights into her daily routine, highlighting the intersection of personal wellness, dietary choices, and lifestyle.

Tendulkar’s day begins with a cup of freshly brewed coffee, a common ritual that underscores the role of caffeine in modern lifestyles. Her subsequent activities involve physical activity; she uses a Pilates Reformer for her workout. The Instagram post then describes a quick shower and a minimal makeup routine, focused on essential products such as sunscreen, concealer, and lip and cheek tint, which shows a focus on health and personal care. Her routine emphasizes the importance of mindful choices, from beverage to physical exercise, and demonstrates an effort to stay active in personal wellbeing.

**Digital Platforms and Culinary Engagement: The Guardian’s Feast App**

The media landscape also highlighted innovative approaches to culinary engagement. The Guardian's Feast app, a digital cookbook boasting over 5,000 recipes, showcases how technology is reshaping the way people interact with food and cooking. The app, with features like cook mode, ingredient-based search, and recipe saving, streamlines the cooking process for users. The app aims to simplify cooking. It can be accessed on mobile devices. This digital platform highlights the increasing demand for accessible and user-friendly culinary resources, catering to the needs of both novice and experienced cooks.

**Conclusion: A Complex and Dynamic Sector**

The food industry on June 5, 2025, presented a multifaceted landscape. The stock market data revealed fluctuations, highlighting the need for careful monitoring and analysis for investors. The digital transformation in culinary engagement offers opportunities for simplifying processes and a more interactive experience with food. Sara Tendulkar’s Instagram post underscores the trend of integrating wellness and personal routines into daily life. The food sector, as these reports indicate, is driven by financial markets, lifestyle choices, and technological advancements, all of which collectively shape the consumer experience and the evolution of the industry. The sector’s performance shows the need to embrace both financial strategy and consumer understanding for long-term success.

We bought a camper last week from marketplace and they stored mothballs inside the camper and also the storage underbelly of the camper. There was a bag underneath the kitchen sink of the camper, under the bathroom sink of the camper, in the bunk room, in the master, and one in the underbelly storage space. Over the weekend, we got rid of the mothballs & used an ozone machine on 30 mins in the living room of the camper, then 30 in the master BR. Let it air out, then cleaned the crap out of it. Well, we went to check on our camper during the week (Tuesday) to see if the smell was any better. It wasn’t. So we scrubbed all the surfaces of a 1:1 white vinegar and water solution and poured baking soda all over the carpets and on the plywood surface underneath the beds. (Yes, mattresses have been removed since we purchased) Checked on the camper again on Wednesday to see if it helped at all. It did not. So on Wednesday we put activated charcoal in coffee filter bags and placed in a bunch of spots. Also put coffee grounds in filters in a bunch of spots. Have had an air purifier running since Wednesday. Our campsite resort is an hour away so it’s difficult making several trips throughout the week. We were hoping to stay the weekend at our campsite but I’m honestly feeling hopeless that the smell will be gone. When we get home just from visiting, our clothes reek of mothballs. & unless this activated charcoal works some serious magic, I have a feeling the smell will still be there. Do I run the ozone machine for an hour or two on Friday? Also afraid to use it because I’ve read it can damage electronics and ruin furniture or surfaces. How long can I run it and not risk damaging anything? What are my options? I would leave the windows open for a week while we’re not there, but as mentioned it’s an hour away & I’d have to be positive it wasn’t going to rain. Do you have any success stories of getting rid of the smell 100%?? Honestly what we’ve done so far seems to only have helped the smell by 10%. 

Please help!!!

I’m a 20M (happy birthday to me ;)) international student currently living in Canada and studying computer programming. I work at a fast food restaurant earning a basic wage (i'm tryna get a well paying part time job but yall know how hard job market is rn), and I also occasionally work at my college (which pays really well, but it’s on-call and not very reliable).

On average, let's day I earn about **$2,000 per month**. (i hope unless they frick my hours even more arghhh ;;;-;;;)

Here’s a breakdown of my monthly expenses:

* Rent: **$450**
* Phone bill: **$65**
* Bus pass: **$126**
* Meal plan (considering getting one): **$250**
* Outside food/coffee/random snacks (gonna try max ;-;): **$50**

That brings my total monthly expenses to around **$950** — whoa.

I want to start investing **$50/month** into a mutual fund (planning to increase it once I graduate and land a good-paying job) also HELP ME TO INVEST YALL IDK ANYTHING. That leaves me with **$1,000 in savings**, which I plan to put into a High-Interest Savings Account (HISA).

I need to pay my tuition fees (**$8,500**) before September. Hopefully, I can save around **$6,000** by then, so my parents won’t have to stress too much about covering  my RIDICULOUS international student fees.

I’d really appreciate any advice on how I can improve my financial journey, savings strategy, or just general tips. Thanks so much in advance, guys!",1,1749153753.0,PersonalFinanceCanada,2,1.0,False
1l49264,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1l49264/an_adhders_existential_wander_through_sitting/,"An ADHD-er's Existential Wander Through ""Sitting Jobs"" as a Mechanical Engineer - Jobs To Work with Your Hands?","tl;dr: What jobs can a mechanical engineer who isn't completely tied to their degree do that doesn't require sitting at a desk all day?

Hey there. I don't use Reddit all too often but I know it to be an excellent way to talk to people about basically anything. I happened upon this Reddit and thought I would share my story thus far.

I'm 26 years old and graduated college with a BS in mechanical engineering because I like solving puzzles with the ultimate goal of becoming an astronaut. College was rough for me on account of the fact that classes with the exception of labs are not hands-on activities. For 6 hours a day, I would sit in classrooms and listen to lectures about genuinely interesting things but always with the added challenge of having a difficult time focusing, the hallmark trait of ADHD. Poor focus is not a new thing to me as I've been medicated for the condition since I was but a wee lad in the 2nd grade. Tests sucked, homework was like pulling teeth. I knew that I understood the concepts but the way I was tested on my knowledge of the subjects was grating at best and wildly incompatible at worst. I made it through though. Got my degree and told myself that if I wanted to become and astronaut, I would need to get a PhD in... SOMETHING mechanical engineering related.

Thus began my first career as a researcher on the Wright Patterson Airforce Base in Dayton, Ohio. Not only did I not know what I was doing, I had no drive to do research in 3D printed electronics (even though I would have sent samples up to international space station for testing), and worst of all this was just a position that I happened to find myself in, expecting people to just give me tasks the same way that professors would assign homework in college. Needless to say, that certainly didn't pan out. My work was cool in the sense that I got to use ludicrously expensive 3D printers and custom designed inks that would deposit aerosolized silver dust directly onto any substrate of my choosing but by this point, I was so tired of stressing myself to death in classes and not having a clear direction that when the Air Force finally cut my measly research funding (which was basically just Uncle Sam's pocket lint and maybe a stray pube), I felt only relief. There was no place more backwards feeling than a military institution that didn't want me there in the first place on account of me having ADHD, something they made abundantly clear in their strict adherence to bizarre schedules, rejecting me from studies on account of my condition not being suitable to their research (when I was taking part in studies), and the stupid flag-lowering ceremony that demanded that I drop everything to stare at a flag on the wall for a minute and a half.

Needless to say, my exodus from the clown car that was being a military researcher attempting to become an astronaut was messy and frustrating. With no other job prospects lined up and my hopes of becoming an astronaut theoretically dashed, I moved back in with my parents and applied to Airstream, Honda, and a small engineering company that my dad runs. While Airstream was interested in hiring me, I declined their offer, accepting an offer from my dad's company (whom the employees deemed me a reasonable candidate for). Thus began my... Maybe 2 years of work for this small firm as a drafter working on \[Big Coffee\] and \[Big Pseudo-Mexican\]. I work 9-5 every day sitting at a desk in a boring little town placing lights and electrical outlets in \[Big Coffee\] shops only for that work to be submitted to the architect and returned to me with little more to say than ""we moved all of those lights you just put in based on our drawings because we didn't feel that we put them in in a straight enough line"" thus resulting in me rebuilding the entire drawing and submitting it again. When that project is all said in done, I am handed a ""new"" project which is little more than a slightly modified prototypical drawing of a nearly identical coffee shop that I just worked on except this time, the architect did an even worse job moving their click-and-drag assets leading to more headaches.

The work is as easy as it is completely brain dead. No amount of money would allow me to force my ADHD to behave for 8 uninterrupted hours while I do the same tasks over and over again. After several bouts of severe depression, I finally started to consider that maybe these so-called ""sitting jobs"" where I work at a desk for 8 hours a day just aren't for me. While I have a great deal of anxiety about the concept of potentially switching jobs, I find myself not even knowing what jobs could even be compatible with my needs. I want to solve puzzles and work with my hands, no be cooped up in some shitty office slowly rotting away from the inside. There is nothing more dehumanizing than corporate Starbucks coming to me to fix the shit that they personally broke because they know that their legions of engineers are just replaceable cogs within a system that cranks out thousands of gallons of overpriced bean water. I know full well that they don't even look at my drawings. I could probably put a note on the drawings calling the CEO a crayon-crunching, glue-huffing, gether upping blate maw who probably couldn't find his own ass with both hands but considering how in-bred the restaurant industry is, in the off-chance that the Starbucks CEO found out about my insults, he would probably end up crying into the ass of the Chipotle CEO or the Piada CEO or whatever.

This job can be summed up simply as the imagery of Mr. Incredible working at the insurance company and I hate it. So what kind of jobs are out there in the wild world of not-lobotomizing-yourself-because-you're-working-a-job-that-disagrees-with-your-brain-at-a-fundamental-level? I once considered becoming a fireman but with how much grooming goes on in college and high school, I'm basically completely unaware of what kind of jobs even exist nowadays. What do you think a bored mechanical engineer with ADHD who has an inherent need to work with his hands can do to that fits his physiological needs? A sailor? An underwater welder?

**CHAPTER ONE**  
**ROUGH DRAFT \[revised\]**

Why am I here? I don’t know. Maybe I’m searching for something.  
I open a book titled *THE AGENDA*. Inside is a quote staring at me in bold: “When we give liberty for normalcy, normalcy is stolen from us also. Now we’ve lost both.”  
My fingers coast along endless shelves of books. The smell of old pages fills the room. All I hear is faint whispers and pages turning. My steps echo off of the hardwood floors, and the silence wraps around me. It feels unnatural—suffocating.  
Every precious moment I spend reading the backs of dust covers on each book, feeling the textured pages, trying to find the one.  
I hear distant muffled laughter—maybe teasing. I peek around the corner of a shelf to see two teenage boys, maybe 17 years of age, whispering, their grins stretched across their faces—somehow contagious.  
I hear something about “a pretty girl and her books.”  
My heart flutters.  
Are they talking about me? Maybe. I would not call myself “pretty,” but I’ll take it.  
They come closer, walking to the end of the aisle I’m on. I see their faces in my peripheral vision. I hear their breaths—fast and shallow. I let my long, earthy brown hair shield my face.  
I wish they would come and introduce themselves.  
I keep on reading, flipping each book carefully through my hands.  
I’m so particular.  
A girl who looks identical to myself walks down the same aisle, looking at me with a flicker of familiarity in her eyes. She carries a stack of 11 books in her arms, arranged in a way that you can see her face.  
I feel like I know her.  
Why does she look like me? Maybe she is me—just more free.  
I hear a deep, unknown man’s voice, so disturbing, it sounds like death. He breathes into my soul.  
“Time’s up. You must leave.”  
I want to speak, but I can’t. I’m caged in my own mind.  
No. I want to keep looking for books—I have only two. This isn’t fair.  
Everything fades to a blinding white.  
I wake up to the sound of monitors screeching and the electrical hum of the blinding fluorescent lights above me. Echoes of footsteps scream from the hall.  
Where am I? I’m not sick—at least I don’t think I am.  
I look to my right. There is a small steel tray with shiny instruments on it, and a vial of what looks to be—blood. The obnoxious smell of latex and rubbing alcohol fills the room.  
There is a certain frigidity to this place that can’t be recreated—an institutional chill lingering.  
I look down toward the end of the bed, and the room seems to stretch another 10 feet or so. Heat waves pulse through my head, making the room spin around me like a tunnel. I reach my hand to feel my face. This is me. This isn’t me. I feel—dead. I’m sweating.  
Hot.  
Cold.  
All at once.  
A needle administers unknown drops into my arm.  
I pull the neckline of my gown down, revealing my upper chest.  
Electrodes.  
Everywhere.  
Nothing feels normal about this place.  
I hear distant echoes from the hall. An eerie woman’s voice says, “Profile 13B is just down the hall—room 392, I believe.”  
A man’s voice, cold, sophisticated, but slightly robotic, responds, “Yes. I’ll get to her momentarily. I just need to check on Profile 13A.”  
Am I 13B?  
I sit up in bed.  
Blood rushes from my head down through my body. Muscles contract in a way I’ve never seen. It feels like the muscle is ripping away from bone. Nerves fire on and off, sending electrical pulses through my body that can be described as nothing short of excruciating. I bite my tongue, holding back a cry. What in the world did they do to me?  
I begin slowly pulling the needle out of my arm with a surprising numbness. Am I even human anymore? It doesn’t feel like it. I pull the electrodes off of my chest, and the monitor goes flat—as if I died. My feet come in contact with the icy tiled floor, and I push myself off of the bed. The room spins, and I fall.  
I have to get out of here.  
That thought drowns out any other noise.  
I’m crawling toward the door when I feel a sting in my arm. There is a needle in my arm. It looks more like a dart than a needle. My cheek presses against the floor, and consciousness begins slipping. Loud footsteps approach me. Through my blurry vision, I see a man dressed in a suit and tie towering above me. He leans down on his knee, his voice the same voice I heard earlier:  
“We’re not done with you yet.”  
Everything blacks out.  
BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.  
The alarm clock sounds, slicing through the silence.  
5:00 A.M.  
I gasp, transported back to my bedroom. The sound pierces through me, fraying every nerve ending. I feel my arm, half-expecting the needle to still be there. My pillow is drenched in sweat. My heart is still pounding.  
The world feels frozen, as if time is absent.  
That wasn’t just a dream—it felt more like a warning.  
I open my eyes to nothingness and look over to my alarm. The red digits peer at me across the room through my blurred vision.  
My head presses deeper into my cold, wet pillow. It felt so real.  
The soft hum of the heater in the corner is just enough to fill the silence. I gently push aside the crisp sheets, letting the cold creep in.  
Shuffling over to my desk at the other side of my room, I blindly feel for the string to my lamp and pull. The dim light is just enough to fight the darkness, sending a ghostly halo through the dark.  
My MacBook, textbooks, and notepads are scattered around carelessly on the desk, but then my eyes stop at the leather journal hiding under a stack of crumpled paper.  
Dad gave it to me for my 17th birthday—just a week ago. He said it would be the perfect place to put my thoughts, memories, and secrets.  
I reach for it, its familiar earthy smell—somehow grounding.  
A journal is the perfect place to write things that nobody else sees. Express emotions that nobody else notices. Sometimes it feels like my closest friend, there to hear my deepest worries.  
I flip it open and start to write.

**\[Lainey Ledger’s Journal | 01.09.2026\]**

There is a familiar weight in the air these days. The world feels colder. It has been a little over a month since the CDC announced a national emergency over NOVIRA-26. We’re back in lockdown—just like 2020. There is an intrusive thought woven into me that I can’t quite shake. Something is different about this time.

My eyes lose focus, the words blurring into each other. I stop writing and listen to my heart pulse in my ear.  
There is a sick feeling in my gut that there is more to this. I’ve been raised to question everything—but this is instinct.  
There is a large window overlooking my desk. I push aside the curtains. It is still dark outside—no signs of life. The moon beams through the trees just enough to make a shadow.  
The window is frosted at the corners. Moonlight patches our long gravel driveway, stretching into the dark abyss. The pines sway gently, as if they are whispering to each other.  
I push open the window and lean over my desk, letting the cold air hit my face. The moonlight reflects off my slightly tanned skin. I inhale, letting the night air relax my muscles. The gentle breeze guides shorter pieces of my hair across my face.  
Wow.  
My parents built a 3,500-square-foot cabin about a mile off a public road, just 20 miles outside of Knoxville, after the panic during COVID-19 hit in 2020. Close enough to the city for good job opportunities, but far enough away to be secluded.  
I’m an early person by nature. There is something special about being awake before the world. That silence is like no other. It is a different type of ‘alone.’ It is the perfect time for me to let thoughts and ideas surface and to be aware of my own emotions—time for just me and God.  
I make my way downstairs, my fluffy socks muffling each step.  
Dad’s already awake, sitting on the barstool at the kitchen island, resting his head on his palm. The dim light above illuminates the golden streaks in his hair.  
The kitchen smells like fresh-brewed coffee and… worry.  
I stand at the last step, looking at him.  
Why is he awake so early?  
His eyes finally find me. He tenses for a second, not expecting me to be there.  
“You’re up early.”  
I lightly chuckle. “Yeah… I’m always up early, but you’re never up early.” I hesitate for a second. “Is there something bothering you?”  
“Just thinkin’.”  
“You can tell me, you know,” I say quietly.  
He runs his hands through his hair, fidgeting a little.  
“Nothin’—um, you hungry?”  
I know he’s trying to change the subject. He freezes for a second—as if he just lied.  
He continues, tension in his voice, “I’m not sure, Lainey. I’ve been noticing things. Patterns. The kind you don’t notice unless you question everything.”  
A weight settles in my chest. What’s going on?  
My eyes meet his—a distant gaze, as if it could fill the emptiness between us.  
“Follow me,” he whispers dryly, rising from the barstool and making his way to the basement.  
I trail him down, my hand sliding along the cold steel railing. It gets colder and colder with each step, and the smell of paint and old cement fills my nose—intensifying by the second. I was never allowed down here until now because of “important stuff.”  
He has a private office down here. A wooden desk sits to the right in the corner against the cinder block walls. On his desk, there is a ham radio, a 24-inch curved monitor, notebooks and pens scattered about, and of course, a coffee maker—because this is Dad.  
He sits down in a mesh office chair and turns towards me, his stormy-blue eyes in a steady focus.  
“When I was in my late twenties, I worked for the U.S. Army Military Intelligence—Signals Intelligence. I worked with classified radio messages and stuff like that.” He pauses for a second, his fingers fused together. His breaths are deep and controlled.  
“Anyway, long story short, I was exposed to some—uh,” he pauses for a moment, then leans forward closer to me—my eyes searching his. “Let’s just say, dangerous things. Information that normal people aren’t supposed to know.” He glances at the ham radio and then back at me.  
For a second, I don’t see Dad—I see someone else. Someone I’ve never met. Who are you?  
“They are classified HF bands for undercover government operations. If this information is handed to the wrong people, they make sure it doesn’t get out,” he says, his voice deep—gut-wrenching. “Luckily, I had enough sense to know it and left immediately, moving across the country and laying low.”  
They would’ve killed my dad.  
I swallow a lump in my throat. My chest finally relaxes. I don’t think I have taken a breath since he started telling me these things.  
“They transmit the HF bands around 3:00 A.M. EST. They hop between 6.2 MHz and 7.9 MHz to avoid scanners picking up their signals. I have a setup where my monitor is connected to the ham radio. When it transmits, it records the message to the monitor, and I transfer it to a hard drive and delete the audio file,” he says, pointing to the nest of wires between the radio and monitor.  
“Unfortunately, though, the receiver only picks up fragments of the message because they jump between frequencies.”  
“Last night,” he continues, his tone getting colder by the minute, “something concerning came through.”  
He opens the drawer and pulls a matte-black hard drive out and plugs it into the side of the monitor. A window pops up. He double-clicks on an audio file labeled:

This is a neuro medsurg unit. She has 10 months or 11 experience. She is very smart and I am not going to downgrade on her intelligence. However, I do not like how she treats the PCTs or considers the precepting role.

She was strangely aggressive with our educator since I didn't have my schedule for the month of June. I said I'll figure it out as it is not serious. She went ""well I need to know when I get paid"". Ooookayy. She does like to rub in my face how she may be a new nurse but she is already a preceptor. I was like ""cool"". Don't know how the conversation started (with multiple nurses), but I said I want kids in the future but not now. And she had the gall to day ""well when is your boyfriend going to marry you?"". Bitch, when the time is right. Then we wanted a patient to poop, and I was going to ask if he wanted coffee to help with lol, and she said ""just make it and offer it"". I said ""I don't want to waste it"" to which her response was ""well I don't want to waste my time"". Then I just shrugged and said ""well he's an easy patient and his room is right there"". Convo ended. She also expresses annoyance that she wishes I was only hers, cause she loves to ""create her orientee"". I thought that was a bit of a psycho comment.  I showed her the trick with a morphine/dilaudid vial to not draw up the meds. I asked if she wanted myself to show her, and she said ""no Ill watch "".And she said ""oh yeah that didn't work when I tried"". Girl please 😂. Plus, the reason I'm split is because she created a hissy fit with management so I could have days with her. Otherwise I would be with my preferred preceptor.  She mistreats other staff and I just don't like her. I apologized to the educator on her behalf because I didn't want to seem like I'm shit talking. And she said ""you're good lol"". She's tolerable in the preceptor sense, and she doesn't bother me. But I can tell she can really hurt a new grad with her wording. She is most definitely a bully. She also told me to ""take 4 patients by the time I see her again so she doesn't have to do all the work"". I'm gonna hang with 3 for awhile.

I'm deeply unhappy with my life. I feel like I'm constantly staving off loneliness and depression. I live in a city I don't like because of a girlfriend I'm no longer with, and haven't been with for the past 4 years. I live in a tiny studio apartment (310 square feet) in the walkable part of my city. I'd love a dog, but my space is too small for that. 

I spend too much money. I spend too much money because I hate being alone in my tiny apartment so I'll do anything to get out - dates, drinks, coffee, museums, travel. I'm very smart, maybe too smart for my own good. That's what my friends always say. I hate being smart; it doesn't make me feel superior or special. It makes me feel inaccessible and strange. It makes me feel lonelier than I already am.

My most recent partner left me in the first week of January, accusing me of having an affair (I wasn't). I fell for someone else, he broke things off, we tried to be friends, I eventually ended the friendship because I was falling in love with him. I miss him every day. We had the same dark, dry humor, similar values, similar interests. Nothing else has come close to that connection. He's the first person I've connected with that way in a very long time. I feel like finding that again would be like catching lightning in a bottle. 

I have a law degree, but didn't sit for the bar. Hated practicing law. Have a JD-preferred job making just under 75k a year doing disability advocacy work, and it's the one part of my life that I currently enjoy. 

I have hobbies. I read, write, draw, paint, play piano, listen to podcasts. But really I just feel like I'm trying to quiet the noise in my head, all the time. I feel like I'm distracting myself, all the time. I have friends, and they are wonderful, and I'm eternally grateful for them. But they have partners and homes and families and I don't have those things, so I'm fit into the margins of their free time. Because they have partners and homes and families, they rarely want to go out. 

I want those things too, but I feel like I'll never get there. I'm tired of doing everything alone. I look around my tiny apartment, at my tiny life, and think, ""This is it?""

I replied and said I respect her situation and that I would be interested in just getting coffee causally sometime— just to remain polite and hang out as friends.  

Anyways, we recently hung out with some of her friends; I drove and picked her up, opened my car door for her, and bought coffee for both of us— just trying to be polite. Just wondering if maybe that was too much or perceived as too chivalrous? I definitely still have feelings for her, but understand her perspective and want to make a good impression on her without making things awkward. 

I feel like maybe she was sending mixed signals in the car as we talked about some personal things, she was playing with her hair the entire time, holds very good eye contact, and has the most infectious laugh whenever we make jokes. It makes it tough for me to not fall harder for her when she does all those things but I don’t know what to do about it. I get I should try to move on, but I feel drawn to her and would love to see where things might go in the future. Any advice?

*Going to keep details discreet*
 Was visiting a city , i live in a rural town. Was going to get coffee before my flight I had a bottle of prosecco for breakfast (I didn’t want to waste it) so I was a bit tipsy.  a man came up being me I don’t know how long he was following me he talked and followed me down the street he did tell me his name and I remember it then another man appeared I engaged in small talk with them. I’m a musician they said they had a recording studio, I thought that was cool and I had two hours to kill before flight.  I missed my flight and I missed my uber.  then I realized they were trying to get a hotel room. All the street cam footage and the cameras in the hotels we went to they all are going to see me causally walking, causally talking , maybe even smiling , looking completely relaxed. I don’t know why I just froze, and followed complete danger. I knew what they were going to do with me when we started walking into hotels and I just accepted it. I was raped a few months ago from a tinder date. 

Then they couldn’t get a room so they called their friend and he called a taxi for us, in the taxi they both put their very expensive jewelry on me and both identified themselves as gang members of bloods and the other was crips, they were cousins. We went to guy #3 apartment. Again I had a chance to run but i fucking didn’t and I don’t know why I just froze and literally became a zombie. All three men raped (or had sex) with me. I tried to go into the bathroom but one of the guys kicked the folding door in so I jumped out. After they took the jewelry off of me and a taxi was called one of the men went inside with me and wouldn’t let me go kissing me and everything. He wanted me to stay, I said no he wouldn’t stop but we made it to the airport and I jumped out. 

It’s been two days I did make an online report and got a call back from the cops I didn’t pick it up. Mostly because I know I don’t have a case , it’s my fault and all the camera footage will prove it. I mostly just hate myself I’m really fucking angry at me. I went back to work , if I think about what happened like go back to that hour I get really dizzy and my whole body just feels frozen like little needles all over. I contacted my friend’s from the city about what happened so at least someone knows what happened. One of them knew two of them men, one of them is a well known pimp so there you go. So now I created this whole entire drama that’s going to go down and it’s over me. I want to die.

## Key Features Analysis

The best big scented candles possess a combination of high-quality ingredients, meticulous craftsmanship, and thoughtful design.Several key features differentiate exceptional candles from average ones.

**Wax Composition:** The type of wax used significantly impacts a candle's performance and longevity. Soy wax, beeswax, and paraffin wax are the most common options. Soy wax is a popular choice due to its clean burn, eco-friendliness, and ability to hold fragrance well. Beeswax is a natural option that burns slowly and emits negative ions, which can purify the air. Paraffin wax, while cost-effective, can produce more soot and may not be as environmentally kind as other options.

The choice of wax also influences the scent throw, or how well the fragrance diffuses into the room. Soy wax generally has a moderate scent throw, while beeswax offers a subtler aroma. Paraffin wax tends to have the strongest scent throw,but at the potential cost of air quality.Many premium candles use a blend of waxes to optimize both scent throw and burn quality.

**Fragrance Blend:** The complexity and quality of the fragrance blend are crucial factors in determining the overall appeal of a scented candle. high-quality fragrance oils, essential oils, and natural extracts are used to create unique and captivating aromas. The fragrance should be well-balanced, with distinct top, middle, and base notes that unfold over time.

A well-crafted fragrance blend should also be long-lasting, maintaining its intensity throughout the candle's burn time. The best scented candles use a high percentage of fragrance oil to ensure a strong and consistent scent throw. They avoid overpowering or synthetic smells, opting instead for nuanced and natural-feeling fragrances.

**Wick Material and Design:** the wick plays a critical role in the burning process.The material, size, and number of wicks can significantly affect the evenness of the burn, the amount of soot produced, and the overall lifespan of the candle. Cotton wicks are a common choice because of their consistent burn and ability to absorb wax efficiently. Wood wicks provide a crackling sound, creating a cozy ambiance.

Large scented candles often utilize multiple wicks to ensure a uniform melt pool and prevent tunneling, which is when the candle burns down the center, leaving wax around the edges. The wicks should be properly trimmed before each use to minimize soot and maximize burn time.

**Container Material and Aesthetics:** The container not only holds the wax but also contributes to the candle's overall aesthetic appeal. Glass, ceramic, and metal are common container materials. Glass containers allow you to see the candle burning and are often available in various colors and designs.Ceramic containers can add a touch of elegance and sophistication to any room.

The design of the container should complement the fragrance and the overall style of the candle. Some candles feature intricate patterns,embossed designs,or minimalist labels. The container should also be heat-resistant and durable to withstand the high temperatures of the melting wax.

**Burn Time:** One of the most significant advantages of large scented candles is their extended burn time. A high-quality, large candle should burn for 50 to 100 hours, or even longer, depending on the size and wax composition. The burn time is influenced by several factors, including the wax type, wick design, and fragrance concentration.

To maximize burn time, it's essential to follow the manufacturer's instructions for candle care. This typically includes trimming the wicks before each use, allowing the candle to burn for several hours to create a full melt pool, and avoiding drafts that can cause uneven burning.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality big scented candle provides several practical benefits that enhance your living space and overall well-being.

**Creates a Relaxing Atmosphere:** Scented candles have a remarkable ability to transform the atmosphere of a room. Certain fragrances, such as lavender, chamomile, and sandalwood, are known for their calming and stress-relieving properties. Lighting a large scented candle in the evening can help you unwind after a long day, creating a serene and peaceful environment.

The warm glow of the candle flame adds to the relaxing ambiance, softening harsh lighting and creating a cozy atmosphere. Scented candles can also be used to create a spa-like experience at home, promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety.

**Enhances home Décor:** Large scented candles are not just functional items; they are also decorative pieces that can enhance your home décor. The elegant containers and captivating fragrances add a touch of sophistication to any room. Candles can be used to complement existing décor styles, whether it's modern, minimalist, or traditional.

They can be placed on coffee tables, shelves, or mantels to add visual interest and create a focal point. Scented candles can also be coordinated with other décor items, such as pillows, throws, and artwork, to create a cohesive and stylish look.

**Long-Lasting Fragrance:** Unlike smaller candles or air fresheners, large scented candles provide a long-lasting fragrance that fills the entire room. The high concentration of fragrance oil ensures that the scent remains strong and consistent throughout the candle's burn time. this means you can enjoy the captivating aroma for days or even weeks, depending on how often you burn the candle.

The long-lasting fragrance eliminates the need for frequent replacements or the use of multiple air fresheners, making large scented candles a cost-effective and convenient way to enhance the ambiance of your home.

**Masks Unpleasant Odors:** Scented candles can effectively mask unpleasant odors, such as cooking smells, pet odors, or stale air. Certain fragrances, such as citrus, cinnamon, and pine, are particularly effective at neutralizing odors and creating a fresh and inviting atmosphere.

Leaving a candle burning for a few hours can quickly eliminate unwanted smells and replace them with a pleasant aroma. Scented candles can be especially useful in kitchens,bathrooms,and other areas prone to odors.

## FAQs Section

**How do I properly care for a large scented candle to maximize its burn time?**
To maximize the burn time of your large scented candle, always trim the wicks to about ¼ inch before each use. This helps prevent smoking and soot buildup. Allow the candle to burn long enough for the entire top layer of wax to melt, creating a full melt pool. This prevents tunneling,which is when the candle burns down the center,leaving wax around the edges. Avoid burning the candle for more then four hours at a time. Keep the candle away from drafts or flammable materials.

**What are the different types of wax used in scented candles, and which is the best?**
The most common types of wax used in scented candles are soy wax, beeswax, and paraffin wax. Soy wax is a natural and renewable resource that burns clean and holds fragrance well. Beeswax is another natural option that emits a subtle aroma and can purify the air. Paraffin wax is a petroleum byproduct that is inexpensive but may produce more soot and can be less eco-friendly. The ""best"" wax depends on personal preferences – soy and beeswax are preferred for eco-consciousness and clean burning, while paraffin offers a stronger scent throw.

**Are scented candles safe to use around pets and children?**
When using scented candles around pets and children, it's essential to take precautions. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep candles out of reach of children and pets to prevent accidental burns or ingestion of wax.Be mindful of the fragrance, as some essential oils can be harmful to pets. Ensure the area is well-ventilated to prevent the buildup of smoke or strong odors.

My name is Ljiljana, but hardly anyone here says it right. At school, I was just Lilly. My family calls me Ljilja, which feels like home, soft, warm, and old. Ljiljana means “lily” in Serbian. I’m eighteen. I was born in Belgrade in 2006 and my Brother Dimitri in 2004 but we call him Dimche, just a few years after my parents moved back there from Melbourne. They’d first come to Australia in the early ‘90s, fleeing a war they never wanted to explain to us properly, moving into a tiny flat in the east of Melbourne. They tried to make a life here, but in 2002, when things felt quieter back home, they packed it all up and returned to Serbia, thinking they could rebuild. They wanted their kids born in their own language, under skies they understood.

That’s where I was born, Belgrade for a few years, we were just two Balkan kids in the Blokovi , raised on instant coffee, street noise, and family who spoke with their hands and fought with their hearts.We spent our earliest years in Belgrade, chasing pigeons through the streets, learning a way of life completey different to the one we would soon know. I don’t remember much about those first years, but I know they shaped me. Serbian is my first language. I spoke it fluently by the time I was four, fast, loud, full of slang I picked up from my cousins. But then in 2010, my parents decided they’d had enough. No future, too much corruption, no steady work. So, we packed our lives into suitcases again and came back to Melbourne.

 In 2010, when I was four and Dimche was six, our parents decided to leave Serbia again. They wanted something more for us, more stability, more chances, more of everything they felt they couldn’t give us there. So, we packed up and moved back to Melbourne, back to a place that was supposed to be home but never quite fit the way it should have. I didn’t speak a word of English when I started school. Neither did Dimche. He was six, I was four. We learned the hard way, through mistakes, through silence, through watching and mimicking until it stuck. I became Lilly. He became Dimi to the Aussie kids. They couldn't say ""Dimitri"" properly, and honestly, I think he liked the new name. It gave him something to hide behind. English didn’t come easy. I mixed up words. I pronounced “three” like “tree.” I got teased for it. I hated reading aloud. I felt dumb. At home, I’d rant in Serbian to my parents""Ne mogu više! Ne razumem ništa!""(I can't take it anymore! I don't understand anything.)and they’d just sigh and say, “Samo polako, naučićeš.”( Slowly, you’ll learn.)

Starting school here was rough. I barely spoke a word of English. Everything felt too fast, people talked fast, the weather changed fast, and I felt like I was always five steps behind. Dimche had it harder. He was older, just old enough to remember what we’d left behind. He didn’t talk about it, but I could feel it. He didn’t belong here, and he never pretended to.  But outside, things were different. In school, we were the kids with the hard to pronounce names. The accents. The weird lunchbox food. I became Lilly because I didn’t want to explain myself every time how to pronounce Ljiljana.I sat there quiet, holding my little lunchbox, not knowing how to say “pencil” or “bathroom.” I remember the teacher asking me what my name was, and I said “Ljiljana” proudly. She blinked. “Lilly?” she asked. I nodded. I was six, and already learning to make myself smaller.


My grandparents when they came here with nothing in the 90's but a few suitcase, old photos of family and that heavy silence people carry when they’ve lost more than they can explain. They don't talk about the war. Not really. Just sometimes, when they've had too much to drink or when the news shows bombed out buildings somewhere else in the world, and my Dede mutters, “samo drugi narod.” (It's always the same). They don’t talk about it much. Only in pieces when a song plays, or the news shows something too familiar, or Baba sighs in that way that makes the whole room go quiet. My Dede just says, “Nemaš pojma šta smo prošli,” and then lights another cigarette. (You have no idea what we went through.)

We live in the northern suburbs, a place that was thick with immigrant stories, where languages mixed on the streets like spices in a stew but now a hub of gentrification. When we came back to Melbourne in 2010, we were two little Serb kids with thick accents, confused eyes, and no idea how far away we really were from everything we knew. In a neighborhood where no one’s really from here, and everyone has a story. The air always smells like a mix of spices, barbecue, and car exhaust. We live in a little brick place with a lemon tree out back and lace curtains that Baba won’t let go of. The hallway is lined with family photos—black-and-white ones from the old country, color ones from our first few years here when everything looked just a little off.

At home, I’m Serbian. We speak the language, even when I have to throw in English words because I forget how to say things like “assignment” or “Wi-Fi password.” We eat sarma and ćevapi, and every December we celebrate our Slava Sveti Nikola with candles, bread, and that same awkward prayer my dad reads from his cracked phone screen. It never feels perfect, but it always feels real. Every Sunday, we eat sarma and roasted pork, and my Mama plays old Ceca songs on her old Blaupunkt speaker she had gotten as a wedding present, the same ones sge swore she’d never listen to again when she left. She still listens everyday like she's still a teen girl in the Blokovi of Belgrade. But out there in school, at parties, online I’m something else. Too foreign for the Aussies, too Aussie for the Serbs. I once told a boy I am proud of my immigrant background. He paused, looked at me like I’d said something shameful, then changed the subject. It stuck with me.

My friends don’t really get it. Some of them are Aussie through and through beach trips, sausage rolls, calling their parents “mate.” Others are from Vietnam, Lebanon, Italy, or also Balkan, so they kind of get the split. But even then, when I say I feel Serbian, people raise their eyebrows. “But you were raised here,” they say, like that cancels everything else out. My friends don’t always get it. I tell them I’m from Serbia and they say, “But you’ve lived here forever, right?” And I say, “No. I was born there. I moved here when I was four.” They pause like that makes things more complicated than they expected. One girl once asked if Serbia was part of Russia. I just laughed. It’s not worth explaining every time.

Sometimes I feel like I’m too Serbian to ever be fully Australian, but too Australian now to ever go back. When I visit Serbia in the summer, my cousins call me “Australijanka” and tease me for saying hvala with the wrong accent. When I’m here, people ask if I’m “from Europe or something.” It’s like I’m always from somewhere else, even when I’m exactly where I belong. But I’ve learned to carry both. My Baba says I have ""duša sa dve strane sveta"" a soul from both sides of the world. I think she’s right.

My brother He got caught up in the streets when he was a teenager. He was smart so smart but that never counted for much in the crowd he ended up in. By the time he was sixteen, he was selling drugs. Just a few caps at parties, he told us at first. “you did the same at my age"" he would say to our father brushing it off. He thought he was just like the Dizelaši he would see in old gangster films.But of course with his insatiable ambition it got more serious than tracksuits, jewelry and cars,fast. Police raid, me, my parents and almost all of our friends getting questioned. He was only 19 when he was sentenced, he'll be out when he's 24. When he went in, it knocked the wind out of our family. Cried for a week. Mum cried in the laundry so we wouldn’t see. Dad went silent. And me? I broke. People whisper about it some in the Serbian community, some at school. I hear the way they say his name now, like it’s a warning. But he’s still my brother. I visit him every couple of weeks. We speak in Serbian, and he always asks how Baba is doing, if Mum’s still going to church, if I’m keeping up with work or school, asking if I'm still sober, he cares He tells me not to end up like him.

We had Culture Day during my last year. Everyone had to bring something from “their background.” Most kids brought food. I brought my Nošnja and a small icon from our krsna slava, a plate of burek, and a photo of my parents on thier wedding day, standing stiffly in a white dress beside my dad in his oversized 90s suit with a obnoxious gold chain and Versace sunglasses. I stood there explaining Slava and the meaning of krsna slava and why Serbs kiss icons and bake bread with a coin inside.  One girl thought I was Greek. Another asked if Serbia was in Russia. One boy laughed and asked if my brother was bringing “rakija from jail"". That's still really stuck with me.

When I got home, Baba was folding laundry and watching SBS. She saw me walk in upset and after I explained she said, “Znaš, Ljiljo… i kad ti je duša umorna, ti si i dalje naša.”
(Even when your soul is tired, Ljilja, you’re still ours.)

I’ve always had to much of my past hold me back already been carrying too much after. Memories and moments that stayed in the dark corners of my head, sharp like glass. Close to my seventeenth birthday, I lost my girlfriend. Around that time I myself had been experimenting with drugs. As one does at that age, but after she had passed I found heroin Or maybe it found me. Either way, it felt like a way out. For a while, it worked numbed everything, blurred the edges. Made me forget how heavy it all was. But it didn’t take long for it to take everything. My body, my mind, my connection to everyone I loved. I lied. I stole. I disappeared from myself. And then, one night, I ended up on a bathroom floor, half conscious, Mama banging on the door, screaming my name like it could pull me back. Some people at school knew, people whispered, old friends stopped talking to me, I was looked at a different way, people would always watch me worried I was going to steal for another hit.


Most people think addiction looks like something dramatic shaking hands, alleyways, screaming fights. Sometimes it does. But sometimes it looks like a quiet girl with perfect attendance, who does her homework on time and smiles too much. It took me a year to admit it was real. Another year to claw my way out of it. Recovery didn’t happen overnight. It was messy. Shameful. Full of relapses, silence, and guilt. But I clawed my way back. I started therapy. I cut out old friends. I stopped running. I learned to sit with pain without trying to kill it. I’ve been clean for  months now. It’s not just numbers on a calendar it’s work. Every single day. Some days I still wake up and feel like I’m made of smoke. But I get up anyway. 

Last year, I graduated high school. I walked across the stage in the most beautiful dress I could find and held my certificate like it weighed a thousand kilos. No one in that auditorium knew what it really meant for me not just passing exams, but surviving. Making it.

Now, I work for a small importation company here in Melbourne. It’s nothing fancy, but its something I enjoy. We import goods from the Balkans everything from ajvar and smoki, to hand-carved wooden spoons and Orthodox icons. I unpack crates that smell like my childhood. I see labels in Cyrillic. I talk to customers in Serbian, watch their faces light up when they find something from “back home.” For a lot of them, it’s the closest thing they’ve had to Serbia in years. It's still a job, that comes with annoyance, but it's something where I actually feel fulfilled. Some days I just pause and think: I made it here. With everything I’ve seen, everything I’ve lived through I made it.

I still visit Dimitri. I still light candles on Slava. I still help Baba roll sarma and argue with Mama about whether we put too much vegeta in everything. I listen to Avril Lavigne in the car and sing Viki Miljković songs under my breath when I’m cleaning. I still live between two worlds, but I’ve stopped seeing that as a curse. Now I know it’s something else a gift I had to fight for.

I live between two skies now—one grey and cracked like the old buildings in Belgrade, and one bright and endless like a Melbourne summer. I’m not fully either. I never will be. But I’ve learned to survive in the middle space.

I am Ljiljana. I am Lilly. I am the sister of a boy who lost his way, the daughter of people who gave up everything twice, the granddaughter of a woman who never stopped believing in me, even when I didn’t.

I have to admit to myself I really only have made about a handful of truly great cups in the past year. The rest come out with a sharp bitter note or a weird cardboardy note. 


For those of you wondering, I used the Switch because it gave me at least consistently drinkable coffee


Ode Gen 2 (typically between 5-6 on grind size)
TWW tried half diluted and full, just use the full now cuz its whatever at least i get some flavor
95° water is my baseline
18g coffee, 270g water (used to be at 288g but because of bypass the coffees all turn out watery)

I used to do the CC’s recipe but it caused a lot of bypass and i couldnt figure out how to make it work well. Tried every grind size from 4-8 on every coffee i’ve had


Now I do
0:00 valve closed, 100g water, med agitation, flow rate 8-10g/s
1:00 open valve, 60g in 6-8g/s low-mid agitation
1:30 60g more, same
2:00 50g more, same but end with a light swirl 
Total brew time 3:30-3:45s


So far best results but otherwise, still get a sharp bitter note some times, or a funky wet cardboard smell and astringency.

A newspaper in the UK called the Telegraph wrote about it early this week.

Article in the Telegraph: [https://archive.ph/xihhE](https://archive.ph/xihhE)

Website for the project: [www.prideandprejudice.uk/](http://www.prideandprejudice.uk/)

I'm a fashion creative director by trade so I know the fashion is not accurate, so please keep in mind that this is Regency through the eyes of a 21st Century curator.

I've not touched any of the words of the story, I have played with the type to emphasise the moments in the story I connect with.

Each picture in the magazine has a qr code which leads to the website where more information about the sources I used in the curation of of that picture are published. I've segmented these into Designers, Personalities and Zeitgeist.  There's also a list of references, which most Regency fans will have already found. I've poured so much I love about the story into the product, from perfumes for each of the Bennet sisters to inserting Austens own jewelery (Or inspired by here jewelery) into the adverts and features. There is a subtext running through the imagry of the stories of the women of the time.

I used an ai tool to create the pictures but then each one had to be further worked on. AI does not do empire line, ai does not do consistancy so a lot of side work was required plus the creative direction of the brands etc.  It's been a labour of love and a lot of fun.  I'm taking my wife away next week to a wonderful hotel near Chawton to celebrate finishing the project. We're going to do the new JA walk. All questions or if you spot somthing amiss with the site please let me know.

Hey r/wordgames! I've been working on a word puzzle game and finally got it to a place where I'd love to share it with you all.

**It's called Word Orbit** \- basically a daily word hunt game with a space theme (because why not, right?).

Here's how it works:

* **Daily Puzzle (7 planets):** The main game mode. Each planet has its own set of letters, and you're trying to find all the hidden words. I aimed for something that takes maybe 10-15 minutes with your morning coffee.
* **Weekly Challenge (9 planets):** This one's tougher - more planets, more words to find. I usually tackle this one over several sessions throughout the week.
* **Mini Daily (5 planets):** Quick version for when you just have a few minutes. Still fun, just bite-sized.
* **Free Play:** No pressure mode where you can just mess around with different letter combinations. Good for when you want to zone out and find words without worrying about completion.

**The scoring twist:** Regular words score based on length, but if you manage to find a pangram (a word using every letter on that planet), you get a sweet bonus! There's something really satisfying about spotting that one word that uses all the available letters. Sometimes I'll stare at a planet for ages, convinced there's a pangram hiding in there somewhere.

**What I've learned from building this:** Coming up with balanced letter combinations is harder than I thought. Too many vowels and it's too easy, too few and it's frustrating. Also, deciding which words to accept was a whole rabbit hole - ended up going with a pretty comprehensive dictionary because nothing's worse than knowing a real word that doesn't count.

The pangram bonus was actually a late addition after I realized how much fun it was hunting for them during testing. Now I can't imagine the game without it - it adds that extra layer where you're not just finding words, but looking for THE word.

If you give it a try, I'd genuinely love to hear what you think. What works? What's annoying? What would make it better? Still tweaking things based on feedback from friends and family (who are probably tired of me asking them to test ""just one more update"").

We recently took on a challenge with a user's new living room, which, as they mentioned, was a bit of a blank canvas with some post-move-in clutter. The main goal was to optimize the layout and bring in some functional yet stylish elements. We used Style Blast AI to reimagine the space, and the results are pretty amazing!

What the AI Did:

Our AI analyzed the original room's dimensions and natural light, focusing on the user's request for layout ideas. Here's a breakdown of the transformation:

* Optimized Seating Arrangement: The AI suggested a more cohesive and inviting seating area with two comfortable sofas, creating a natural conversation zone centered around the coffee table.
* Defined Entertainment Zone: A sleek TV console was introduced, providing practical storage and a clean look for the entertainment system, perfectly positioned for optimal viewing.
* Strategic Storage and Decor: On the right side, where there was previous clutter, the AI incorporated a stylish console table with a lamp and framed art, adding both functionality and aesthetic appeal. Woven baskets were also added for discreet storage.
* Window Enhancements: New curtains were added to frame the window, enhancing privacy and adding a touch of softness to the room. A simple pendant light replaced the existing one, contributing to a more modern feel.
* Warmth and Texture: A large, light-colored rug was placed to anchor the living area, adding warmth and defining the space. Indoor plants were strategically placed to bring life and freshness into the room.
* Overall Cohesion: The AI aimed for a minimalist yet warm aesthetic, selecting furniture and decor pieces that complement each other in terms of style, color, and proportion, resulting in a harmonious and inviting living space.

This transformation really highlights how AI can simplify the design process, providing practical and beautiful solutions for even the trickiest layouts.

2. The fic is with the reader as a nurse, and she loves helping people, especially the elderly. I think Bucky, a mob boss or a ceo, visited his old friend; the reader is this old man’s neighbour's nurse. I think there’s a detail where her coffee got splashed on his dry-cleaning vest, and instead of bringing his laundry bill to her, he bought her a new phone?

1l481km,https://engage.ottawa.ca/s1-barrhavensouth-phase3,Public Feedback Opportunity for Half Moon Bay (Barrhaven) Expansion,"In 2021, the Half Moon Bay (Barrhaven) expansion was approved (the main nearby roads are Barnsdale, Greenbank, the 416 Highway, and Cambrian Rd). Currently, there isn't a developer's application for this area, however there is a public engagement opportunity to provide suggestions and feedback for the planning process.

Currently the Half Moon Bay area of Barrhaven is purely residential and does not have any commercial businesses. This means that whenever these residents want to get groceries, go to the gym, get coffee, go to their doctor's office, etc. they have to either travel across the river to Barrhaven proper, go further south to Manotick or take the highway. In addition, the residents in this area are bottlenecked to three bridges that connect to Strandherd Road, or they have to go around by taking the highway or Prince of Wales. One of the bridges has bike paths, one bridge is very narrow and oddly shaped, and one is rural farmlands.

Strandherd Road was originally designed to support Barrhaven proper and now experiences constant traffic due to the Half Moon Bay addition over the last decade. In addition, Manotick has also seen an increase traffic for area that previously considered itself a small town within Ottawa. Addressing the lack of commercial space in the Half Moon Bay neighbourhood would help relieve the traffic in the surrounding areas.

The current city plan is for this expansion area to only be low rise residential. The city plan can be found in the documents in this [link](https://engage.ottawa.ca/s1-barrhavensouth-phase3).

There is a need for additional housing in Ottawa and there is also needs to help improve the Half Moon Bay neighbourhood. There would be two possible solutions that could meet both these needs. These two solutions could also be complimentary and combined.

1.) **Mixed used medium density** (business on the bottom, residential on the top and typically 3-6 storey tall): 

Minimal existing housing touches this new development area, which should mean minimal resistance to medium height buildings (3-6 storey). Some residents aren't fans of buildings being taller than their single detached homes/townhomes, so new land expansion areas are good opportunities to add medium density with minimal NIMBYness.

Examples of busineses that would fit into mixed used buildings would be: convenience stores, gyms, cafes, restaurants, daycares, medical offices, etc.  


2.) **Mixture of stacked townhomes, low rise apartments, and commercial buildings:**

Stacked townhomes and low rise apartments take up less space than single detached homes and row townhomes. This would free up land to add standalone buildings for businesses.



The current plan for single detached homes and row townhomes would cause OC transpo to have to weave through several streets and intersections to service this expansion area. While adding medium density and commercial areas could help OC transpo better service the expansion area and Half Moon Bay in general, since there would be fewer stops and greater volume of transit users.

There is also a lack of bike lanes and multi-use pathways in the Half Moon Bay area. Empty land like this expansion area is easier to add these pathways than adding pathways to existing developed streets. These pathways would compliment the commercial build up in Half Moon Bay expansion since it would help reduce car traffic by giving the residents more options to travel.



**Sending feedback to the city is very easy and will only take a minute or two.** You can email the city planners for this expansion, the two barrhaven councillors (Wilson Lo and David Hill)  and the suburb mailbox. I believe the subreddit rules prevent me from providing their direct email addresses.

  
There are currently feedback opportunities for other parts of the city. This reddit [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1kzc5q9/public_feedback_opportunity_for_stittsville_south/) has the Stittsville South Expansion write up that I created last week.

1l47woo,https://www.reddit.com/r/seasteading/comments/1l47woo/the_unique_economics_of_seasteading_cities/,The Unique Economics of Seasteading Cities,"Doing some braAInstorming on how economics changes in a floating city.  Especially in terms of cost of living.

Currently, as an example, there is a popular coffee shop in San Francisco, where land is extremely scarce. Because demand is high and the coffee shop cannot expand in capacity, high demand causes the price to rise. Now it's a $20 cup of coffee with lines around the corner.

In a seasteading city where land space is not a limiting factor because you can always float the entire city away in any direction to expand your business, high demand for coffee could be paired with expanding capacity almost immediately, allowing prices to remain low.

Now multiply this effect across the entire economy, what results?

---

AI: You’re absolutely right to zoom in on land scarcity as the central constraint.

Let’s break it down.

Key Assumption: Seasteading cities can scale horizontally by adding new floating modules, allowing for rapid expansion of physical space as needed.

Immediate Economic Consequence:

In a typical terrestrial city like San Francisco, land is artificially scarce, which imposes a rentier bottleneck. You want to open a bigger coffee shop? Too bad—real estate is limited, rent is astronomical, zoning is restrictive. Thus, demand increases → price increases → only luxury versions of goods can survive (e.g., your $20 cup of coffee).

In contrast:

> On a seastead, demand increases → capacity increases → price stabilizes or even falls.

---

So What Happens When You Multiply This Dynamic Across the Whole Economy?

1. Collapse of Urban Scarcity Rents

If modular expansion becomes the norm:

Landowners can no longer extract massive rents simply for owning prime location.

Commercial and residential real estate become commodities, not luxury assets.

Prices of goods and services stabilize closer to marginal cost + reasonable markup, not scarcity-inflated prices.


> This is post-scarcity urbanism.

2. Flattening of Class Stratification

In landlocked cities, space constraints create hard class barriers:

Rich live near opportunity; poor are pushed to the periphery.

Seasteads with mobile, expandable infrastructure disrupt this hierarchy.

Anyone can expand housing, services, or production capacity, lowering barriers to entry.

This doesn't magically eliminate inequality, but it makes it far harder to entrench.

---

3. Hypercompetition and Price Suppression

When physical constraints are removed:

Competitive businesses can scale quickly to meet demand.

Prices trend downward under competition, assuming no artificial monopolies.

Even luxury goods have to fight harder to justify premiums.

You may get high-end offerings, but not because there’s no alternative. The $20 coffee has to compete with a floating café that can triple capacity overnight and sell for $5.

---

4. Entrepreneurial Boom

New entrants are not locked out by real estate costs.

Floating city ""zoning"" is dynamic—if there’s demand for a district of VR arcades, fashion ateliers, or biotech labs, they can be built tomorrow.

Dynamic industries (e.g., startups) flourish, as they are no longer throttled by NIMBYism or city planning inertia.



---

5. Population Self-Sorting and Specialization

Seasteads can physically cluster based on lifestyle, industry, or ideology.

This creates functional cities, not just demographic blobs.

Cities evolve like coral reefs—nodes form, grow, and rearrange based on flows of capital, energy, and talent.


It’s not utopia. But it’s liquid capitalism—literally.


---

What Doesn’t Magically Fix Itself

Despite this flexibility, some economic pressures persist:

Raw material logistics (you still need imports).

Skilled labor shortages.

Power generation and water remain cost anchors unless local systems (e.g., solar, desal) are optimized.

External regulatory constraints—most seasteads will still interact with states.



---

Real World Analogy: Cloud Computing vs. Physical Servers

On land: opening a new business is like setting up physical servers—expensive, slow, prone to bottlenecks.

On seasteads: it’s more like spinning up a new instance in the cloud—modular, scalable, responsive.



---

Bottom Line:

A floating city seastead removes one of the most inelastic supply curves in the economy: land. The result is a system where physical space and capacity can match demand, breaking the price-surge cycle that plagues urban centers.

*Going to keep details discreet*
 Was visiting a city , i live in a rural town. Was going to get coffee before my flight I had a bottle of prosecco for breakfast (I didn’t want to waste it) so I was a bit tipsy.  a man came up being me I don’t know how long he was following me he talked and followed me down the street he did tell me his name and I remember it then another man appeared I engaged in small talk with them. I’m a musician they said they had a recording studio, I thought that was cool and I had two hours to kill before flight.  I missed my flight and I missed my uber.  then I realized they were trying to get a hotel room. All the street cam footage and the cameras in the hotels we went to they all are going to see me causally walking, causally talking , maybe even smiling , looking completely relaxed. I don’t know why I just froze, and followed complete danger. I knew what they were going to do with me when we started walking into hotels and I just accepted it. I was raped a few months ago from a tinder date. 

Then they couldn’t get a room so they called their friend and he called a taxi for us, in the taxi they both put their very expensive jewelry on me and both identified themselves as gang members of bloods and the other was crips, they were cousins. We went to guy #3 apartment. Again I had a chance to run but i fucking didn’t and I don’t know why I just froze and literally became a zombie. All three men raped (or had sex) with me. I tried to go into the bathroom but one of the guys kicked the folding door in so I jumped out. After they took the jewelry off of me and a taxi was called one of the men went inside with me and wouldn’t let me go kissing me and everything. He wanted me to stay, I said no he wouldn’t stop but we made it to the airport and I jumped out. 

It’s been two days I did make an online report and got a call back from the cops I didn’t pick it up. Mostly because I know I don’t have a case , it’s my fault and all the camera footage will prove it. I mostly just hate myself I’m really fucking angry at me. I went back to work , if I think about what happened like go back to that hour I get really dizzy and my whole body just feels frozen like little needles all over. I contacted my friend’s from the city about what happened so at least someone knows what happened. One of them knew two of them men, one of them is a well known pimp so there you go. So now I created this whole entire drama that’s going to go down and it’s over me. I want to die.

I receive an order $60 for an hour-5 drop offs. It took almost an hour for anyone to come out of the pickup door. I didn’t care. I was just playing on my phone and enjoying my coffee. Someone finally comes out and puts 15 Nintendo Switch 2s in my car. I scan for 5 of them. I can’t lie, I had a moral quandary. I finished my orders with 10 Switches extra. Pretty soon after, I get a call from a panicked Walmart employee. I didn’t want to get deactivated, or worse, arrested for grand theft. I also didn’t want to royally fuck someone working at Walmart or potentially disappoint some eager child, so I went to return them. I pulled up to the pick up area. I called twice and nobody picked up. I waited until a loader came out and told him I was returning 10 Nintendo Switches. He said they didn’t have any returns initiated so it was my problem. I parked and got a cart and went inside to customer service. You can’t imagine the looks I got on my way in with a cart full of Switches. I gave them to customer service who were highly suspicious of someone fucking up a fraud scheme and I left with a clear conscious.

1l47pwg,https://i.redd.it/5k184befq55f1.jpeg,Is it possible to never get a good cup of espresso depending on the beans?,"Brand new to espresso, and recently got my breville barista pro. The first bag of beans I used was counter culture hologram. After a little toying around, I was able to make what I thought was some pretty decent espresso. I am not much of a coffee “snob” and drink my espresso with milk, so I’m pretty easy to please. 

When I ran out of beans I went to the store to pick up some Lavazzo beans, but they were all pre ground. I ended up blindly getting blue bottle espresso beans (which was my first error because apparently nestle owns them and fuck them) because again I’m not super picky. I figured something was better than nothing and I’d just continue to toy around and improve as I go. 

When I tell you I cannot for the life of me make a decent shot of espresso, I am not kidding. Even with milk and sweetener, it tastes like crap. I also cannot get a good pour- no matter how fine I grind the beans (as you can see currently on 7) it starts pouring around 4 seconds. I’ve tried weighing it, not weighing it, decreasing the grind, increasing the amount, nothing is working. I use the needle tool to help distribute evenly, as well as a puck screen. Yet all I can make is shitty, inconsistent espresso. 

Should I just toss the beans and try something new, or is this just user error? 

Also, I do plan on going to a local coffee shop and picking up beans there next time. I was really just going for convenience, but I think that was definitely a bad call. ",13,1749150483.0,espresso,15,0.89,False

1l47p2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1l47p2a/afraidfixated_on_the_idea_that_i_have_ms/,Afraid/fixated on the idea that I have MS,"Hello all. I am a 40M, white, in the USA. 5'10"" and 171 pounds. Generally healthy and active. I drink on weekends, probably more than I should. Sorry in advance for the long post.

Lately I have been very afraid and fixated on the idea that I might have ms due to some symptoms that I've been experiencing. I've been to a couple of doctors over the last 2 years, neither have considered my symptoms  overly alarming, though I am scheduled to get an MRI in a couple of weeks after I expressed to my PCP that this is causing me a good amount of stress and anxiety. Overall I would say my worrying about this is considerably more disruptive to my life than the symptoms themselves, which I would describe as generally mild.

This started two years ago in spring 2023, shortly after I started lifting weights. I was experiencing pain in my wrists, occasional numbness/tingling in my hands. Doctor gave me Diclofenac to use as needed, ran through a few tests like resist as I pull your hands apart, grip,, etc. Said I seemed healthy, and was likely just nerve damage, possibly from how I sleep.

A year later it returned/ was noticeable enough that I went back to the same doctor. More or less same diagnosis.

  
A few weeks ago as I experienced these symptoms again, along with pain/numbness in my ankles and feet. A different doctor gave me the same prescription, along with steroids and a muscle relaxer which I haven't taken (I did take the Diclofenac for a week).

  
This weekend I was drinking very hot coffee and found that I couldn't swallow it, this has never happened before or since but since I have been researching MS I know difficulty swallowing is  a symptom, and it really freaked me out, essentially ruining a day out with my wife. I also have felt very shaky since then, I have a slight tremor in my hands and especially my ring finger when I hold them out in front of me. Also noticed my hands were really shaky when I was brushing hair that evening. I have also noticed the occasional ""Are you trying to activate siri"" message from my computer as I accidentally double press the command key when trying to do commands (I'm a software developer).

  
I went back to the doctor yesterday, and that is why I have the MRI scheduled. He ordered it w/o contrast, I'm not sure if that is relevant or useful.

I've also been experiencing really bad sinus pressure lately, and the sensation of a head cold. It's not persistent, I've attributed that to allergies ( I recently moved to a new region and I've had seasonal for some time). I've switched from zyrtec to flonase and that seems to be helping.

  
I noticed some issues with my sight, but a trip to the optometrist gave me a very mild perscription at that seems to be helping reading text on my computer. I'm adjusting to new glasses now as well.

  
Yesterday and today I had a sudden cramp on my left rib cage, and of course I've been wondering whether that is an 'ms hug'. As I sit here it's not actively hurting, maybe just a remnant of a cramp or tightness.

I'll say I am no athlete but am a fairly active person.  I haven't worked out in a week as I decided I would rest to see if my body needed a break. I don't log miles like I used to, but I have run thousands and ran a marathon in late 2022. In 2023 I decided to focus on strength training, and I do lift weights at a fair density 3-4 times a week, as well as continue to run though considerably less in the last year (\~250 miles). I definitely feel like grip is a limiting factor for me lifting weights, but I am lifting 40-50 lb dumbbells when I say that.

  
Lastly I'll say I am under a fair amount of stress lately. In fact I would say quite a bit, for the last year. This is work and personal stuff, probably not worth diving into much detail, but stuff that feels existential on a regular basis.

  
Anyway, I hope this isn't too much text. I think I could chalk my symptoms up to a bunch of different things and I know researching MS isn't really helping my mental health, I intend to see someone about developing strategies to help me avoid these sorts of invasive thoughts when they occur. I guess I am seeking advice on whether I should continue to investigate and find a doctor who will key in more on MS or other neurological issues, are there any tests or things I should ask about, or any strategies in dealing with this kind of anxiety or symptoms.

I'm finishing up my novel and wanted to get a critique of my query letter. Please let me know what you all think! : D

=====

Dear Agent, 

Kayla wants nothing more than to escape the haunted manor. After waking up in an unfamiliar place, she finds herself bound to a horror-filled house. Kayla must face her deepest fears if she ever wants to see home again. 

When Kayla wakes up on the floor of a manor without any memory of how she arrived, she explores its halls in search of the shy inhabitant that keeps making coffee for her. After finding a skeleton key she manages to open one of the many locked doors, only to stumble across a living jack-in-the-box. 

Kayla retreats into the snow-choked woods. Quickly she realizes that no matter which direction she travels she will always arrive back at the manor. She doesn’t want to go back inside, but she isn’t alone in the woods. With no hope of escape through the forest, her only chance lies behind a heavily locked door of gnarled wood inside the manor. She’ll need to face her nightmares to collect the keys or risk becoming like the things outside. 

Hollow is a literary horror novel complete at 59,000 words. It combines the classic mythological adventure of Inferno by Dante Alighieri with the magic of Locke & Key by Joe Hill.

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,

=====

*First 300 Words:*

*SLAM!*

Not sure which hurt more: my face slapping the floor or the auditory punch from the splintering crack of the door shutting behind me. My ears rang in protest. 

*Well, that hurt.* Gingerly, I lifted my head and opened my eyes. *What the hell happened?* I pulled my arm out from under my body to join its counterpart in front. I pressed both hands to the floor to lift myself up, causing my fingers to splay out in front of me. Their glossy baby pink painted nails looked flat compared to the beautiful polished cherry wood floor beneath them. Lights from overhead even managed to softly reflect off the wood. 

My head was killing me. It felt like the kind of hangover you got in college before swearing off tequila. Groaning, I placed a hand on it. *How the hell did I get here?* My memory was a bit fuzzy. One moment I was driving, the next I was here. Wherever here was. 

I glanced around. Looked like I was in the foyer of an old house. Can’t say it looked like any of my friends’ places. Maybe their grandparents’. I took a deep breath. 

“OK. Breathe, Kayla. Think.”

Last thing I remembered before getting in my car was arguing with my fiance. I needed to clear my head, so I left the house. *Did I go drinking and black out?* Certainly possible. I wouldn’t have driven myself afterward, though. I closed my eyes. *God.* I moved my hand to cover my face. Mark, that creep from work, texted me all the time. Please tell me I hadn’t asked him for a ride.

I reached for my phone in my back pocket. A quick peek at it would answer any questions I had. *Oh no.* My heart sank, fingers failing to come into contact with the hard plastic of my phone case.",2,1749150373.0,PubTips,3,0.75,False

I've tried everything, SIBO is now on my radar.","Hi all, I'm new here. I'm a 33 year old woman. I have had chronic health issues (including digestive ones) for 12+ years.  I have never had any of my doctors test me for SIBO, and I stopped going to conventional doctors years ago because they always gaslit me and told me it was fine when I would say my symptoms.  I now consult functional medicine practitioners and have recently learned that as far as the gut goes, I have mold illness (mycotoxin colonization), h pylori, candida, many nutritional deficiencies, and a very congested lymphatic system. despite this, nothing that I've ever done with any practitioner, even the non-conventional ones, has ever fixed the digestive issues that I have. If, based on my symptoms that I will list below, it seems like I could have SIBO, I will get a test at the conventional doctor. however, I don't have constant bloating, so it's unlikely they'd even give me the test. Based off of what I've read on the Internet, it seems likely I could have SIBO, and it might explain why nothing I do works. I'd like to hear your insights..***.do the digestive symptoms seem like they could be SIBO despite the lack of constant bloating and gas?*** please refrain from ""GO TO A DOCTOR"" comments; I will do that if it seems likely I could have sibo, but wanted opinions first.

***Digestive symptoms:***  
\-bowel movements haven't been normal since 2014: partially digested food in every stool. Loose, lighter brown / dark tan stools that are greasy and not formed well. sometimes they're very thin and small. they sometimes break apart. seems like I have trouble digesting fats too. a very strong smell to  bowel movements (I don't know what it is). I've tried taking HCL (hydrochloric acid) supplements to increase stomach acid, digestive enzymes, ox bile, bitters, and liver support, all to support enzymes and bile to digest food more. nothing helps. I continue to not be able to digest things full and have these abnormal bm's.  
\-pain in ileocecal valve (the valve that connects the small intestine to the large intestine) sometimes  
\-regular dull throbbing pain in liver/ gallbladder area  
\-bloating and no-scent gas for no reason sometimes, but only really when I eat too much fat, nuts, or seeds  
\-sometimes reflux of food involuntarily but not always. this was my first chronic symptom in 2014 and hasn't happened in a while.  
\-pain in small intestine area ONLY if I eat something extremely triggering. this doesn't happen much.

***Other (non-digestive) symptoms:***  
\-many nutritional deficiencies (iron dysfunction, vit b6, vit b2, vit c, b12, copper, vitamin e, vitamin A, vitamin D, and many more). I take all of these supplements and more and still remain low because of malabsorption.  
\-deadweight body fatigue (like I'm made of lead)  
\-full-body muscle twitches sometimes for days on end  
\-hair thinning and loss on head  
\-male hair growth on my (female) body, indicating testosterone metabolism issues  
\-high estrogen  
\-night sweats  
\-sinus issues (chronic post-nasal drip, congestion often in sinuses and chest)  
\-chronic cough  
\-immune suppression: recurrent tonsilitis with fever and recurrent strep throat; sick once a month  
\-derealization, depersonalization (both dissociative disorders), anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure  
\-trouble focusing, poor memory, anger issues (feel irritated a lot)  
\-eczema and dermatitis in the colder months  
\-greasy scalp not long after washing hair  
\-swollen and sore neck lymph nodes often  
\-oxolate pain and high oxalates  
\-occular migraines  
\-cold hands and lower body temperature

***Things I've tried:***  
\-digestive enzymes, HCL, bitters, ox bile, leaky gut protocols, probiotics, coffee enemas, anti-fungals for candida, various herbal remedies for h pylori, homeopathics, a few liver flushes, various diets (paleo, autoimmune, vegan, no sugar), binders for mycotoxins, mineral and vitamin supplements (many!), glutathione, magnesium, colostrum for the gut lining, and so so much more",1,1749150266.0,SIBO,5,1.0,False

CQ CQ CQ DX... KD8DIE... QRZ on 13.233...

I sat up, jaw aching like someone had nailed my teeth to the bone. The metallic taste of blood confirmed I’d been grinding again.

I’d dabbled with amateur radio in college. Knew the cadence, the clipped syntax.

KU3RIP... QSL... WX clear... standby for coordinates...

I sat at my kitchen table, notebook open, transcribing morse fragments. The signals were clearest when I stayed perfectly still, mouth open like a human phonograph.

KC9ASH to base... drones en route... ETA 0600...

By morning, my jaw tendons had locked. Coffee was agony. Chewing scrambled the messages. The nerves in my teeth begged for relief from the signal’s vibrations.

KD8DIE to base... 5 2 9... secondary relay operational QSL...

KU3RIP... CFM... 38.4312 N, 79.8397 W...

KC9ASH... PKG DLD... standby SIG QRM...

I tried speaking once. The signal vanished. When I went still, it returned. Clearer.

I scheduled an emergency appointment with Dr. Maddox.

He reviewed my x-rays. “Perfectly ordinary,” he announced.

The signal was silent, like they knew it could compromise them.

“Stress-induced auditory hallucinations,” he declared, performative and loud enough for anyone listening.

He handed me a prescription. Haloperidol.

Beneath it, his address and phone number, with a message:

*Don’t take these. Just get it filled. Text me tomorrow.*

That night, the signal sharpened. I was becoming a better receiver. I dreamed of satellites. Bone-white lattices floating in the dark, transmitting to us. Planning something.

In the morning, my notebook brimmed with coordinates I didn’t remember writing.

*All stations... convergence initiated...*

*KD8DIE... QSY to 28.450... await instructions...*

*KU3RIP... coordinates locked...*

*KC9ASH... final phase...*

I plotted the coordinates. West Virginia. The National Radio Quiet Zone.

My blood went cold. I knew the NRQZ. 13,000 square miles of restricted transmissions.

If you wanted to hide something, that’s where you’d do it.

I texted Maddox.

*I know what they’re doing. They’re bypassing the NRQZ!*

He replied with directions.

*Go to the address. Tonight.*

I found him at the national park, maps spread across a picnic table. Three others stood nearby, mouths open, code pouring out. Dozens more paced the grounds.

His eyes were bloodshot. Jaw clenched. He transcribed furiously.

“How many of us?” I asked.

He held up both hands. Opened. Closed. Again. Again.

Thirty.

The coordinates from each of us formed a perfect circle.

Dead center: Green Bank Observatory.

*All stations... convergence achieved...*

*Mission complete... drone incursion imminent...*

*Receivers to self-destruct in 10... 9... 8...*

My skin prickled. Ozone burned my sinuses. My hair stood on end.

Maddox turned. “What do they mean, *incursion*? Self-destruct? Radio waves don’t explode people!”

5... 4... 3...

Something burned behind my eyes. We arched and spasmed.

Heat. Pressure. Internal. Uncontainable.

2... 1...

Maddox dropped first, cooked in place. Then the rest followed.

We bloomed from the inside.

A cold October wind howled through the valley, causing the slit of my black dress to flutter against my thigh. Frustration mounted behind my eyes as I waited for an answer, glaring through the passenger’s side window while shivering from the violent squall.

Getting the sense that he was intentionally ignoring me, I pulled trembling fists from the pockets of my wool coat and improvised a drum solo against the thick glass. My knuckles were so cold that I barely felt them make contact.

The amateur rendition of Van Halen’s *“Hot For Teacher”* was enough to get his attention. A scowl curled up the side of his face. Without moving his eyes away from the blinking screen, Hank leaned over to roll down the window, his beer gut flopping awkwardly over the central console like a pillowcase half filled with maple syrup. He gave the crank two lazy twists, and the window creaked down a few inches.

*“Robin - what the fuck is the matter? It’s the goddamned World Series,”* he said, pointing at the small TV and acting like I was unaware of that fact. Hank had nearly careened off the road multiple times on the thirty-minute drive over here, seemingly unable to drag his eyes away from the game for more than a handful of seconds at a time.

I felt a myriad of insults thump against the back of my teeth, begging to be unleashed, but I swallowed my annoyance.

*“Can you please just look at the sign?”* I pleaded, gesturing to the name listed above a picture of the deceased.

*“…’85 wasn’t our year, but ‘87…’87 is for The Cardinals…”* he muttered, still glued to the feed.

*“Hank, for the love of God, confirm that I’m walking into the right funeral or I’m getting back into the car. I was told the guy’s name was ""‘John’, not ‘Jom’. The damn sign says ‘Jom’.”* I snapped.

Hank slumped his shoulders with childlike exaggeration and sighed. Reluctantly, he shoved a meaty claw into the breast pocket of his blazer, digging around for the instructions given to him by our escort agency. With a crumpled slip of paper in hand, his pupils finally detached from the game. Hastily, he scanned the name and date.

*“Looks right to me,”* he remarked. Before I could ask to see it too, he spat chewing tobacco that had been resting along his gumline into the slip. My eyes widened in disbelief as I watched Hank wrap the paper around the brown-black ichor, only to then toss the malformed lump into his coffee cup.

*“Christ, Hank. You couldn’t have just handed it to me, like a human being? Or are you not a human being? Maybe you're actually some human-shaped donkey? Does that sound right?”*

The insult finally brought his eyes to meet mine. Instead of anger, he shot me a threatening grin. A wolf’s smile, bearing hungry canines in my direction.

*“Look, doll - how about you tiptoe those fragile, porcelain feet up to the home’s concierge and ask about the service? I’ll wait here. If it ain’t right, we’ll go back to the office.”*

He expected a sheepish reply, but I sure as shit didn’t give him one, instead providing a thumbs up with my right hand and a middle finger with my left. I didn’t scare easy. Not only that, but I’ve been in the escort business long enough to know the difference between an actual predator and a small man making empty threats.

When I turned to walk up the cobblestone path that led to the funeral home, my ears became filled with the sound of Hank slamming his foot down on the accelerator, tires screeching against asphalt. Didn’t even bother to turn back around, honestly. No point.

*“Asshole.”* I murmured, securing my purse under my arm to prevent it from blowing away as I approached the opulent, repurposed plantation house.

The mansion’s white pillars loomed over me as I carefully climbed the porch steps, stilettos clacking against the refurbished wood. As I stepped toward the front door, a surge of anxiety unexpectedly sprinted up the length of my spine and planted itself at the top of my neck, crackling around the base of my skull like electricity from an exposed wire. With my heartbeat galloping in my chest, I took a deep breath and twisted the knob, not willing to let nervous energy prevent me from earning my keep.

A lot of what happened to me was out of my control, but I did one thing wrong that day. My gut was screaming for me to turn around. It implored me to sprint back down those stairs and into the street like the devil themself was close behind me, nipping at my heels.

But I ignored the feeling, contorted my face into an expression of grief, and pushed on, unknowingly putting myself into the Cult of the Scarab's crosshairs, intruding on their rite of sacred renewal.

\----------

*“Right this way, ma’am,”* said the funeral director, leading me into a familiar narrow hallway behind the lobby. Only a week earlier I’d been at this funeral home, pretending to grieve over someone else. As we walked, I reviewed the details I’d received concerning the deceased, provided to my agency by his company’s board of investors.

*Pharmaceutical CFO. Passed in his late sixties. Very private. Had two previous marriages. Right hand was mangled during his tenure in Vietnam, doesn’t bother with a prosthetic. Months before his death, rumors of him being gay cropped up in the tabloids.*

*I’m playing his secret lover. An unknown buxom paramour, weeping over the loss of their sugar daddy, dispelling the whispers of his potential homosexuality.*

People purchased my time for an assortment of different reasons. Sometimes, I was hired by the soon-to-be deceased, arriving at their memorial service just to boost the overall number of attendees visibly present and grieving. Other times, the request was more specific and it wasn’t the deceased who was hiring me.

This was one of those *other times.*

It wasn’t glamorous work, lying at some poor sap’s funeral on the behalf of someone else and their interests, but it was much preferable to the labor I performed when I was first hired. Think fishnet stockings and disagreements over the virtues of condom use.

All that said, it'd be disingenuous to say I wasn't proud of myself.

This was my niche, and despite the seediness, it was mine, and I was good at it. Considered an expert, actually. Anyone can show up and be a pretty face in the crowd; a twenty-something with running mascara and a nice ass cartoonishly *boo-hooing* into an open casket. But me? I played the assigned role with tact and nuance. I sold a narrative, and nine times out of ten, my marks bought it.

The key was you needed to be a proficient improviser.

Discretion was the name of the game in my line of work; I rarely got a lot of background information about the deceased to work with. Meant I had to be capable of thinking on my toes - bobbing and weaving through conversations like my life depended on it.

Ironically, though, if I wasn’t so damn convincing, I might not have ended up almost suffocating to death less than an hour after the funeral concluded.

\----------

I expected all the usual sounds of organized memorial would become audible as we approached the reception hall; sobbing, a pipe organ singing its quiet lamentations, hushed arguments over the division of an inheritance. Sounds most people associated with deep sorrow. To me, however, mourning sounded like work. It was ambient noise I had become so accustomed to that I barely even noticed it.

But that’s not what I heard as we drew closer to the service. Quite the opposite, actually. Joyful sounds reverberated down the hallway. As the funeral director opened the door to the reception hall, I heard laughing and the clinking of glasses. The sparkling timbre of a wedding filled my ears, not the joyless dirge of a wake.

I stepped in, and for a moment, I truly believed I was walking in on some kind of themed birthday party. Every attendee sported a pure white outfit, head to toe. The previously jubilant noise fizzled out into dead silence when they saw me enter, adorned in funerary black. I was nearly about to excuse myself back through the door when I spied a young man at the opposite end of the vast room, dressed in a black three-piece suit, leaning wearily against an enormous marble coffin.

*“Is…is this Jom’s funeral?”* I managed to sputter out into the motionless crowd.

The fifty or so funeral goers remained silent. I could tell that something about my arrival was intensely befuddling, with looks of confusion painted over the attendee’s faces. Eventually, the shrill squeaking of poorly lubricated metal wheels broke the silence. The crowd parted to reveal an elderly woman in a wheelchair pushing herself towards me. She peered from side-to-side as she approached, observing the still petrified mourners staring at me with a look of disapproval.

*“Oh, would you relax? Go back to what you were doing. I’ll figure it out. Khepri save us, y’all would be startled shitless by a ladybug if it flew at you too fast,”* she croaked. Slowly, the figures in white pulled their attention away from me, and the lively chatter resumed, albeit at a much lower volume.

With the funeral reanimated, the elderly woman brought her eyes to mine, converting her scowl into a toothy grin. A wispy white dress hung loosely from her skeletal frame, giving her the appearance of a mobility-challenged banshee. The weight of a golden broach pulled the front of her dress forward at the collarbone, revealing the outlines of her upper ribs through thin, liver spotted skin. The accessory was about the size of a golf ball, and it depicted a beetle with what looked like a lotus flower etched onto its wings.

*“And you are, dear?”* she asked, settling in front of me by using a levered brake to halt the wheelchair’s momentum.

Based on the woman’s command of the other mourners and her wizened appearance, I made an educated guess as to her identity.

*“Hi…you must be Jom’s mother?”*

She nodded, her brow furrowing and her grin melting away as her head tilted up and down. The matriarch studied me intensely, her expression now twisted into one of confusion, like those of the mourners when they first saw me.

Relief fluttered through my chest. I briefly savored the pleasurable rush that came after the anxiety of a calculated risk. Then I smiled, took a generous inhale, and continued, launching into an ad libbed speech I had given countless times before.

*""It is nice finally to meet you. I…I wish it wasn’t under these circumstances, and I wish I knew your first name, but you know how private Jom can be-”*

I paused and forced a chuckle, letting tears well up as I broke eye contact - body language that screamed “*I’m struggling to use past tense now that he's dead, oh the sweet misery”*. A sigh fell from my lips, and then I picked up where I left off.

*“…you know how private Jom* ***could*** *be. I’m Tara. Your son and I were together for the last year or so. What’s your first name, ma’am?”*

Unexpectedly, I watched her eyes widen with some mix of alarm and disbelief.

*“It’s…it’s Akila”*

Without saying anything more, she abruptly pivoted her head and torso around, scanning the room for someone. Akila seemingly couldn’t locate them in the crowd, so she just started shouting a name.

*“Horus! Hoooorus! Could someone bring my grandson over?”*

The figures closest to us leaped into action, clearly fighting to be the person that fulfilled Akila’s request. Within seconds, one of the attendees, a hulking middle-aged man with biceps like tree trunks, returned with the kid in the black suit that had been previously leaning against the coffin, practically dragging the miserable looking young man by the wrist to his grandmother.

*“Ah! There you are, Horus.”* Akila cooed.

The boy barely responded, giving his elder an affirmative grunt. Before he was pulled from the crowd, I was laser focused on selling my story, constructing answers to questions that hadn’t even been asked yet. Seeing the anguish dripping off his features broke my concentration.

He looked to be in his early twenties, about six-feet tall, with a shaved head and a half crescent nose ring connecting his nostrils. His eyes were saturated with a deep, reflective sadness, his gaze empty and distant, like he was watching a memory rather than actually seeing anything physically in front of him. The corners of his mouth were collapsed into a rigid, immovable frown, the type of vacant expression that’s left over only after you’ve already completely exhausted every other painful emotion.

My heart broke for him. Whatever familial weirdness was currently on display, with the perfect white dress code and the inappropriately cheery atmosphere, the kid seemed like he was the only one experiencing genuine grief. His dad was dead, and he looked hurt and alone.

That empathy would last about another ten minutes.

*“Horus…this woman, Tara, is claiming to have been with your father, and she’s showing up here dressed like…dressed like that. Did you know anything about this?”*

*This might be game over,* I thought to myself. *Need to come up with a way to recover.*

He pointed his empty gaze at me. For a second, his eyes remained cold. But then, like the flash of blinding white light before the explosion of an atomic bomb, his expression instantly brightened and became animated. It wasn’t recognition that had reignited Horus; it was something else.

It was an idea. I didn’t know it at the time, but Horus was a pretty damn good improvisor as well.

*“Yeah, I know her. Dad mentioned her a few times in passing. Told me that she may or may not show up today. He wasn’t sure whether she really loved him or not, but I think he told her to show up if she did really love him.”*

He paused, calculating what to say next.

*“Tara’s an outsider. Dad wasn’t sure that we’d accept her, especially after what happened with Diane.”*

Akila turned back to me, now stone-faced and deathly serious.

*“Well, Tara, is all that true? You’re here because you loved my son?”*

I didn’t have long to contemplate the strangeness that was unfolding in front me, so I acted on instinct.

Terrible call.

*“…yes! Yes, I loved Jom. That’s why I’m here.”*

Horus nearly crumbled to the ground, his immovable frown ascending into a grin swollen with ecstasy.

*“Well…well alright then. That’s very noble of you, to come here of your own volition, espousing your love from my son. Bassel, could you escort Tara to the front? Show her where family sits? The eulogy will be starting in a few minutes.”* Akila replied.

The brawny gentleman with the tree-trunk biceps walked over, placing one massive arm forward to guide me and the other massive arm on my shoulder, as if to make sure I wasn’t going anywhere.

Behind me, I heard Horus cackling, doubling over and practically wheezing from whatever he found to be so goddamned funny.

\----------

There was a certain comedy to the way Akila had been positioned to deliver the eulogy. I couldn’t appreciate the humor of it at the time, with Bassel following me like a shadow, his looming presence causing a veritable chorus of alarm bells to ring loudly in my skull. But, in retrospect, I remember the juxtaposition of her in front of the casket being genuinely funny.

She was just so absurdly small, and the coffin was just so absurdly big. A marble torpedo behind a human earthworm, wrinkled skin flapping up and down as she spewed her ritualistic bullshit into the microphone.

*“Jom was a wonderful son, a loving father, and a devoted vicar of Khepri.”* Akila boomed, voice tinged with bursts of static from cheap speaker systems.

*“When Jom was on death’s door, we all felt his pain. In terms of renewal, he was without an ideal conduit. We all still grieve the loss of Diane, consumed by heresy, leaving him without love and Horus without a mother.”*

I turned to Bassel, pointing to my bladder and then pointing to the door. It was a lie; nature wasn’t calling. Not in that sense, at least. My subconscious was screaming, begging me to get the fuck out of that room through whatever means possible.

*Something is so fucking wrong,* I thought, waiting for Bassel to respond to my pantomiming.

He smiled, but it wasn’t reassuring. The grin was patronizing, revealing his own bitter amusement rather than his willingness to help, like he was watching his cat trying and failing to jump onto a forbidden table.

The man shook his head *no* a few times, and then placed a hand over my scalp, manually twisting my head back in the direction of Akila.

*“Little did we know, however, that in the nick of time, Jom found love. He was scared to divulge his love to us, because she is an outsider, just as Diane was. But, by being here, she has proven herself worthy of Khepri’s embrace, unlike the heretic.”* she said, gesturing a bony hand in my direction, long acrylic nails taking the shape of hawk talons.

*“Tara - we’re very grateful for your love, and your commitment to Jom. As you well know, passionate love is the best conduit. It's easier for Khepri to mold. But, of course, the love of youngest son will do if passionate love isn’t available. All that is to say, I’m sure Horus is very grateful, as well.”*

At that point, my heart was crashing against my rib cage like jackhammer, percussive and relentless. Bassel’s sturdy hand remained on my head, fixing my gaze on Akila.

Because of that, I couldn’t look away when the matriarch turned to face me, detailing what was to be my fate.

*“Your black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.”*

Sweat poured over my body, drenching me with sticky fear.

*“Are you ready, Tara?”*

Another white-clad figure appeared behind Akila, wrenching the heavy lid of the casket open.

Inside, Jom’s desiccated corpse laid flat, arms crossed over his shoulders, naked as the day he was born. But his body only covered half of the available space.

You see, the reason the coffin was so damn large is because it was built to house two separate people. The other half *had* been for Jom’s son, but now it was designated for me.

They were going to bury me alive in that marble tomb.

As if I even needed it confirmed at that point, I noted that the body had both of their hands. My actual assignment had lost one of his during their tour of Vietnam.

Hank had dropped me off on the wrong day.

When I didn’t move towards the casket, paralyzed by fear, Akila spoke into the microphone one more time, sharp static crackling through the speakers again like an electric tongue whipping invisibly through the air.

*“Bassel, it seems like Tara is having a bit of cold feet. Bring her over here, show our conduit how spacious it is inside, next to her beloved.”*

The man’s muscular paw pulled my head up, forcing me to my feet.

I tried to brainstorm even a fragment of an exit strategy, but for the second time that day, Horus broke my concentration.

Somewhere in the back of the room, I heard him snickering under his breath, downright elated with his unbelievably good fortune.

I wouldn’t let him distract me again after that.

\------

“*This…this is a huge misunderstanding…I didn’t know him…I didn’t know Jom…*” I sputtered, now only feet away from my waiting tomb.

No one responded. Not a peep of recognition from any of the attendees. I wondered if the words had actually left my mouth or if I had just imagined they did as Bassel forced me closer to the marble casket, inch by tortuous inch.

He was looming over me like a rain cloud, leading me forward with a burly arm wrapped tightly around my shoulders. At that point in my life, I hadn’t ever been married, which gave the slow, ritualistic procession towards the corpse in a box a certain perverse, darkly humorous quality. Like this was the closest *I’d* ever get to being a bride, given my sordid lifestyle. A sick joke; the universe chuckling alongside Horus, having a hearty laugh at my expense.

It was *almost* right, too. It had most of the pieces, at least. From a distance, it could have looked like a wedding, if you didn’t squint too hard.

Bassel, an older gentleman, guiding me towards my soon-to-be husband, giving me away till *death do us part*. Akila, the officiator, reciting the ceremonial words and ordaining the marriage. A crowd of loved ones, waiting patiently to witness the union.

All the cardinal signs of a marriage service; excluding my pulseless betrothed, of course. I looked at him and felt a frantic repulsion cascading through my body.

This was no wedding.

Jom had been completely drained of fluid, crumpling his skin and causing his body to curl slightly forward like a dead spider. A single, oversized nail pierced his skull, entering one temple and exiting the other, with bits of light reflecting off the shimmering metal visible in his eye sockets. If his eyes were present, they would have been shish kabobbed. They had been excised, however. I’d rather not speculate on whether someone performed that surgery pre- or post-mortem.

As I approached the casket, my thoughts and actions had stagnated, mired in the sheer impossibility of my circumstances. A paralytic disbelief of sorts; a desperate prayer to wake up from this fever dream.

A smell broke that stagnation. The scent of embalming fluid, ripe yet artificial like a cucumber pickled in bleach. When it hit my nostrils, my body sprang to life.

Formaldehyde worked like smelling salts that day.

“***Let me the fuck go***,” I shrieked, arcing my arm forward to send a pointed elbow behind me, crashing into Bassel’s diaphragm.

The blow stunned him momentarily, allowing me to squat down and out of the arm that had been tangled around my shoulders. It wasn’t enough, though. As I turned to run, he extended his leg in the direction I was escaping, tripping me with the heel of his white boot. I fell hard, face first, my forehead bouncing off the tile floor with enough force to cause my ears to ring.

Terror had made me forget the golden rule; the key to survival in the seedy underbrush where I earned my keep.

If they’re bigger than you, go for the eyes or the balls.

I moaned on the floor, concussed and bleeding from a fresh cut over my eyebrow. Before I knew it, Bassel had pulled me upright. My vision spun, making the room a disorientating blur of light and movement. In the meantime, the attendees had erupted, jumping from their seats and unleashing cries of anger and disgust, enraged by my treachery.

When I could focus, my eyes landed on Akila, still sitting in a wheelchair next to the coffin. Deep hurt twisted the old woman’s face; wrath burned in her eyes, yet her quivering lips showed her dejection, as if she couldn’t decide whether to scream or sob.

I bent down, making my face level with hers, trying to explain my outrageous circumstances over the shouting and caterwauling of the white-clad funeral goers.

Unfortunately, the words came out rushed. The coherency was spotty at best. There was too much to explain and not enough time to do it in.

*“Listen, Akila - my name is not Tara, it’s Robin. I work for an escort agency. My job involves attending funerals, sometimes pretending to be someone I’m not. They assigned me to go to a funeral for a man named ‘John’, but my driver must have dropped me off on the wrong day. I’m paid to lie. I didn’t know your son…”*

Somewhere in the crowd, I could hear Horus shouting at us.

*“Whatever she’s saying, it’s not true! She just doesn’t want to be a conduit anymore for Dad! Just like Mom!”*

Akila turned her head away from me, her reply bubbling with resentment.

*“You’re almost as bad as Diane, Tara.”*

*“Khepri have mercy on your soul.”*

\------

Despite my hysteric pleas, the coffin lid kept sliding. The harsh friction of stone moving against stone filled my ears, like the sonorous bellowing of an unseen God, welcoming me into their vast kingdom, excited to show me around.

A waning beam of light, a rumbling *snap* of the lid settling into place, and then there was nothing.

I'm plunged into blackness; unfettered, impenetrable, and all-consuming. Incomprehensibly perfect darkness, like the deepest ocean floor or the most distant reaches of space.

My mind spins. My heart quakes against my chest.

*The truth didn’t work.*

*I need something else.*

I beat my knuckles bloody against the marble lid, but it wasn’t any use. Although the casket was wide enough to fit two people, it was less than a foot high. I couldn’t swing my arm back far enough to generate meaningful force. Even if I could have, though, it wouldn’t have mattered. Not even Bassel’s tree-trunk biceps could have broken through solid stone. What chance did I have?

Still, I had to do something.

Eventually, one of my punches went off course, curving a little too far to my left. When it rebounded off the lid, it fell straight down, and the back of my hand clipped the dead man’s face before I could retract the limb to its original position on my chest. At that point, I stopped my futile barrage. I had been doing all I could to avoid touching the corpse. Now that I had, all of my energy and focus needed to be diverted to keeping myself from vomiting.

My mind replayed the memory of that sensation on a loop.

He was drier than I expected. Desiccated and stiff like rotten apricot or expired beef jerky. *Leathery* comes close to describing it. *Reptilian* comes even closer. Honestly, though, I can’t find something that fits just right. There just aren’t the words for it.

An unexpected *thunk* erupted under the tips of my shoulder blades, and I finally screamed. I had been trying to stay calm. Conserve every precious molecule of oxygen that I could. But the surprise broke my concentration, and I let loose gallons of pent-up terror into a single, earsplitting noise. I coughed and wheezed from the strain it put on my vocal cords, but as soon as I could, I revved up my larynx and started all over again.

Eventually, I ran out of steam, shrieks puttering out into choked wails and smaller fits of coughing. That exhaustion, thankfully, was helpful. The numbness was centering, in a sense. It allowed the more analytic parts of my brain a chance to take the wheel.

I needed a plan.

So, I listened closely, trying to use ambient noise to determine where I was. With my ears perked, I could appreciate a gentle tapping from somewhere above me. It sounded like the dainty pitter-pattering of drizzling rain, but it wasn’t consistent. There were pauses in between the tapping every few seconds or so.

The realization caused a surge of panic to explode through my chest like dynamite, but I maintained my composure. With time running thin, I couldn’t afford *not* to maintain my composure.

The *thunk* was the casket colliding with the bottom of a grave, and the tapping sound was dirt being shoveled onto me.

Onto *us.*

Just then, there was another sound. Something much closer, internal to the coffin, rather than the external tapping of the dirt against stone. A quick *pop* from somewhere beside me.

The creaking of a joint that hadn’t moved in quite a while.

\------

*“Oh Christ! Oh my God, he’s biting me!*

“*He’s scratching at my face, Jesus Christ let me the fuck out of here!”*

The tapping stopped. There was muffled conversation from somewhere outside the coffin, but I was too insulated to hear what was said.

I kept screaming.

*“Jom, I’m sorry. God, I’m so sorry!”*

*“He doesn’t want me here! He doesn’t want me here!”*

About a minute later, a tiny glimmer of light entered the casket, mirroring my evolving fate. Life snatched away from death at the eleventh hour; not much time to spare.

The lid fell to the ground with a heavy *thump*. Two blurry figures stood above me, but I couldn’t discern exactly who they were. The sunlight was blinding.

I must have looked like death. Long, four-fingered scratches all over my face and chest, horizontal swipes overlapping with vertical ones to form bloody cross-links. Wild terror stitched into my eyes. Ragged breaths like I was in the throes of an asthma attack.

A familiar voice from outside the grave rang down to me.

*“You said ‘he doesn’t want me here’? That’s what you said?”* shouted Akila.

I slowed my hyperventilation. My vision finally adjusted, and I saw two male attendees I didn’t recognize, eyes darting between me and Jom’s corpse. Inspecting us. By the time they had opened the coffin, Jom had stilled.

*“Yes…he started…he started whispering that to me. Then…then he attacked me.”*

There was a pregnant pause. The men looked up, waiting for their next orders.

*“Alright, then. He must be rejecting you. Guess he knows better than we do. If you weren’t his love, you wouldn’t be able to grant him renewal, I suppose. Pull her up here.”*

*“Someone get my grandson from the van, too.”*

\------

Once I was topside, Bassel became my watchdog again. There was discussion about what to do with me, but I didn’t wait for them to come to an agreement.

As fortune would have it, my captor was fairly well endowed, both his stem and his berries. Makes it all easier to find in a pinch.

I spun, grasped his family jewels, twisted them around their axis and pulled down, bringing Bassel to his knees. Once his head was within reach, I jabbed a thumb into his eye. Don’t think I blinded him, but he was certainly incapacitated at that point.

Before long, I was sprinting out of the graveyard. I passed Horus on my way out, writhing against the ground, two attendees dragging him by his wrists towards the hole his father was lying in.

He saw me, and I’m glad I had the presence of mind to wave at him as I was dashing by, a massive smile plastered on my face.

\------

Of course, Jom didn’t *actually* rise from the dead. That popping sound *was* his shoulder joint, but it made a noise because I accidentally knocked into it, not because he was moving it.

But that gave me an idea.

What I realized was that in order for those psychos to believe that I wasn’t who I had said I was originally, I needed objective evidence that I was an imposter. From what I could gather, they were trying to use me to resurrect Jom. But, like any cult, the process had rules.

*“Passionate love is the best conduit.”*

*“The youngest son will do if passionate love is not available.”*

*“Your black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.”*

I pretended it was real and imagined what might happen. Maybe Jom would attack me, desperate not to be buried with a con artist that wouldn’t actually provide him with new life because their sacrifice didn’t abide by the rules.

So, I scratched myself to hell and back. Spewed some bullshit about how he wasn’t actually dead. Made sure to sell the idea while not making my actual intentions obvious.

It worked, and I am beyond grateful that it did. That said, there’s no justice to any of it. Horus didn’t deserve to be in that pit either.

But, at the end of the day, I’m a survivalist.

Better him than me.

\------

I can’t believe all of that was thirty years ago. Time really is a wonder and a terror.

Never went back to the agency after that near miss. Partially because of how big they fucked up, stranding me there on the wrong day. Mostly, though, I left because I didn’t want Akila and Bassel to show up at some point, looking to snuff out a loose thread. I mean, I told Akila my first name and my occupation. I felt like it wouldn’t require too much legwork to find me if they really wanted to.

Packed my bags, moved across the country. Kept my first name but changed my surname. Got myself a husband and a few kids, as well as a job as a hairdresser. You know, I finally integrated into society. Left my niche behind, so to speak.

Over the years, the memories have grown a bit dusty. They don’t have as much terror associated with them as they used to. Which, in turn, has caused me to be plagued by nostalgia. A longing for the good old days, when I was really and truly alive.

Of course, that’s all delusional rubbish. I just needed a reminder; a sample of that long dormant fear.

I sure as shit got one.

About a week ago, I was in the middle of an appointment, going through the motions like I had so many times before. I finished up, about to walk away, when the client said something. A complete non-sequitur. Barely said a word before that.

*“You know, it’s the color that’s really the key.”*

I shot the client a funny look, because I had no idea what they were talking about. They had asked for a trim, not a dye job.

They saw my confusion in the mirror, gave me a lecherous smile, and continued.

*“Color is so important, love. It doesn’t get as much credit or attention as it used to, but that doesn’t mean it’s lost its potency. Quite the opposite, actually. It’s a resource that’s remained relatively untapped, which means the potency has accumulated, gathering over time. Now, my love, it's a wellspring.”*

*“What I’m saying is, it all would have worked just fine if you stayed with me. You really were dressed for the occasion, Robin.”*

And finally, I see it. He looks *like* Horus, but not exactly.

I hadn’t ever seen him with eyes before, but I suppose that man was Jom.

*“Call me sometime, okay? We have a few things to clear up.”*

He handed me a card on his way out. I’m staring at it now, fighting back nausea, feeling my heart slam against my ribs, rapid like the wings of a hummingbird. There’s a number on the back.

*“Amsi, museum curator for the Khepri Foundation. \[xxx-xxx-xxxx\]”*

Pure white on both sides.

Golden scarab on the back, with a lotus flower etched into its wings.

1l47hj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1l47hj0/just_came_back_from_paris/,Just came back from Paris,"We just came home from a week in Paris, and I have to say, it was the best trip of our lives.

I went with my wife and our 5-year-old daughter. We stayed for about a week and visited plenty of places. Here's the best and worst part of our visit.

**Best dining experience** was hands down at [O Coffee Paris](https://www.ocoffee.fr/). The waitress was super polite and friendly. She made us feel welcome and wanted. She asked where we’re from and what brought us to Paris. I answered “Disneyland,” which was the truth, and I instantly regretted it. She kind of shrugged, then continued to compliment how beautiful our daughter is (this would happen several times everyday, also when strolling through the city, which is not common in Denmark).

Anyway, I ordered everything on the breakfast menu, and although I’m not a fan of avocado, it was heavenly. As we exited the restaurant, I told the chef it was the best breakfast we’ve had in Paris, also the only one at that point, and he laughed. It still remains the best, even after seven more breakfasts. We’ll definitely return. As we left, we noticed a line of at least 15 people waiting to get in.

**Best attraction** was without a doubt the **Louvre Museum**, and that's saying something, because there’s so much to see in Paris, and we’re *not* done yet. Our 5-year-old daughter was fascinated and wanted to know everything about each piece of art. Unfortunately, I can’t speak or read French, so… I told a lot of stories :)

As an ethnic Iranian, it made me sad to see the breathtaking historical treasures of Persia in a foreign country. But honestly, I’m infinitely more grateful that they’re preserved in a place where millions can see them. I’ve been to Persepolis and seen the ruins of the old empire, the Tomb of Cyrus the Great… and it’s alarming how little care is given to maintaining those priceless treasures.

**Unexceptionally friendly people.** We met one old lady who frowned at us, but everyone else, from hotel staff to people on the street, shop owners, other tourists, even the street hustlers, was full of smiles and kindness. I feared Parisians would be arrogant and only respond in French, but I was completely wrong. My prejudice was put to shame. You guys made us feel like we belong. 

**Wrong expectations.** We didn’t hear *La Vie en Rose* on every street corner. We didn’t see Remy cooking ratatouille behind every restaurant window. And we only saw two people wearing those classic French hats, which was just… disappointing :)

**Worst part.** The smell of sewage and urine in some parts of the city. I’ll leave it at that. Also, the tap water tasted bad, so we only drank mineral water, 4 euros for 500ml, which feels borderline criminal. Next trip, we will fill the car with mineral water as we exit Germany.

**Bonus lowlight.** We stayed at Novotel Eiffel Tower hotel. The room stank of sewage, and we had to get downgraded just to find one that didn’t. Not going back there.

**Another bummer.** Seeing homeless people in extremely bad conditions. It's sadly common in big cities and we've seen similar and worse, but for some reason it really hit us hard (perhaps it's the contrast). In Denmark, it's rare to see that level of poverty. My wife had a mental breakdown and cried. I tried to console her with some dark humor: “If only we could bring him to our hotel and give him a nice shower... but I fear the stink would scare him away...” Not my proudest moment, but sometimes you just cope how you can.

**But... overall?**  
We’re definitely coming back to Paris (and not just because of Disneyland!). Paris completely stole our hearts. Our experience was overwhelmingly great. The restaurants were reasonably priced. The food was delicious. The architecture was timeless and beautiful. And getting around was super easy thanks to the metro and the *Bonjour RATP* app. And again, you guys made us feel like we belong, which is truly the biggest compliment I/we can give.",15,1749149961.0,ParisTravelGuide,28,0.7,False

1l47h3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1l47h3z/i_had_a_career_as_a_professional_mourner_during/,"I had a career as a ""professional mourner"" during the 80s. The last assignment I ever accepted nearly got me killed.","*“You sure this is the right place, Hank?”* I shouted from outside the limousine.

The husky chauffeur didn’t respond, attention transfixed on his handheld television, fiddling with the antennae to minimize static. A cold October wind howled through the valley, causing the slit of my black dress to flutter against my thigh. Frustration mounted behind my eyes as I waited for an answer, glaring through the passenger’s side window while shivering from the violent squall.

Getting the sense that he was intentionally ignoring me, I pulled trembling fists from the pockets of my wool coat and improvised a drum solo against the thick glass. My knuckles were so cold that I barely felt them make contact.

The amateur rendition of Van Halen’s *“Hot For Teacher”* was enough to get his attention. A scowl curled up the side of his face. Without moving his eyes away from the blinking screen, Hank leaned over to roll down the window, his beer gut flopping awkwardly over the central console like a pillowcase half filled with maple syrup. He gave the crank two lazy twists, and the window creaked down a few inches.

*“Robin - what the fuck is the matter? It’s the goddamned World Series,”* he said, pointing at the small TV and acting like I was unaware of that fact. Hank had nearly careened off the road multiple times on the thirty-minute drive over here, seemingly unable to drag his eyes away from the game for more than a handful of seconds at a time.

I felt a myriad of insults thump against the back of my teeth, begging to be unleashed, but I swallowed my annoyance.

*“Can you please just look at the sign?”* I pleaded, gesturing to the name listed above a picture of the deceased.

*“…’85 wasn’t our year, but ‘87…’87 is for The Cardinals…”* he muttered, still glued to the feed.

*“Hank, for the love of God, confirm that I’m walking into the right funeral or I’m getting back into the car. I was told the guy’s name was ""‘John’, not ‘Jom’. The damn sign says ‘Jom’.”* I snapped.

Hank slumped his shoulders with childlike exaggeration and sighed. Reluctantly, he shoved a meaty claw into the breast pocket of his blazer, digging around for the instructions given to him by our escort agency. With a crumpled slip of paper in hand, his pupils finally detached from the game. Hastily, he scanned the name and date.

*“Looks right to me,”* he remarked. Before I could ask to see it too, he spat chewing tobacco that had been resting along his gumline into the slip. My eyes widened in disbelief as I watched Hank wrap the paper around the brown-black ichor, only to then toss the malformed lump into his coffee cup.

*“Christ, Hank. You couldn’t have just handed it to me, like a human being? Or are you not a human being? Maybe you're actually some human-shaped donkey? Does that sound right?”*

The insult finally brought his eyes to meet mine. Instead of anger, he shot me a threatening grin. A wolf’s smile, bearing hungry canines in my direction.

*“Look, doll - how about you tiptoe those fragile, porcelain feet up to the home’s concierge and ask about the service? I’ll wait here. If it ain’t right, we’ll go back to the office.”*

He expected a sheepish reply, but I sure as shit didn’t give him one, instead providing a thumbs up with my right hand and a middle finger with my left. I didn’t scare easy. Not only that, but I’ve been in the escort business long enough to know the difference between an actual predator and a small man making empty threats.

When I turned to walk up the cobblestone path that led to the funeral home, my ears became filled with the sound of Hank slamming his foot down on the accelerator, tires screeching against asphalt. Didn’t even bother to turn back around, honestly. No point.

*“Asshole.”* I murmured, securing my purse under my arm to prevent it from blowing away as I approached the opulent, repurposed plantation house.

The mansion’s white pillars loomed over me as I carefully climbed the porch steps, stilettos clacking against the refurbished wood. As I stepped toward the front door, a surge of anxiety unexpectedly sprinted up the length of my spine and planted itself at the top of my neck, crackling around the base of my skull like electricity from an exposed wire. With my heartbeat galloping in my chest, I took a deep breath and twisted the knob, not willing to let nervous energy prevent me from earning my keep.

A lot of what happened to me was out of my control, but I did one thing wrong that day. My gut was screaming for me to turn around. It implored me to sprint back down those stairs and into the street like the devil themself was close behind me, nipping at my heels.

But I ignored the feeling, contorted my face into an expression of grief, and pushed on, unknowingly putting myself into the Cult of the Scarab's crosshairs, intruding on their rite of sacred renewal.

\----------

*“Right this way, ma’am,”* said the funeral director, leading me into a familiar narrow hallway behind the lobby. Only a week earlier I’d been at this funeral home, pretending to grieve over someone else. As we walked, I reviewed the details I’d received concerning the deceased, provided to my agency by his company’s board of investors.

*Pharmaceutical CFO. Passed in his late sixties. Very private. Had two previous marriages. Right hand was mangled during his tenure in Vietnam, doesn’t bother with a prosthetic. Months before his death, rumors of him being gay cropped up in the tabloids.*

*I’m playing his secret lover. An unknown buxom paramour, weeping over the loss of their sugar daddy, dispelling the whispers of his potential homosexuality.*

People purchased my time for an assortment of different reasons. Sometimes, I was hired by the soon-to-be deceased, arriving at their memorial service just to boost the overall number of attendees visibly present and grieving. Other times, the request was more specific and it wasn’t the deceased who was hiring me.

This was one of those *other times.*

It wasn’t glamorous work, lying at some poor sap’s funeral on the behalf of someone else and their interests, but it was much preferable to the labor I performed when I was first hired. Think fishnet stockings and disagreements over the virtues of condom use.

All that said, it'd be disingenuous to say I wasn't proud of myself.

This was my niche, and despite the seediness, it was mine, and I was good at it. Considered an expert, actually. Anyone can show up and be a pretty face in the crowd; a twenty-something with running mascara and a nice ass cartoonishly *boo-hooing* into an open casket. But me? I played the assigned role with tact and nuance. I sold a narrative, and nine times out of ten, my marks bought it.

The key was you needed to be a proficient improviser.

Discretion was the name of the game in my line of work; I rarely got a lot of background information about the deceased to work with. Meant I had to be capable of thinking on my toes - bobbing and weaving through conversations like my life depended on it.

Ironically, though, if I wasn’t so damn convincing, I might not have ended up almost suffocating to death less than an hour after the funeral concluded.

\----------

I expected all the usual sounds of organized memorial would become audible as we approached the reception hall; sobbing, a pipe organ singing its quiet lamentations, hushed arguments over the division of an inheritance. Sounds most people associated with deep sorrow. To me, however, mourning sounded like work. It was ambient noise I had become so accustomed to that I barely even noticed it.

But that’s not what I heard as we drew closer to the service. Quite the opposite, actually. Joyful sounds reverberated down the hallway. As the funeral director opened the door to the reception hall, I heard laughing and the clinking of glasses. The sparkling timbre of a wedding filled my ears, not the joyless dirge of a wake.

I stepped in, and for a moment, I truly believed I was walking in on some kind of themed birthday party. Every attendee sported a pure white outfit, head to toe. The previously jubilant noise fizzled out into dead silence when they saw me enter, adorned in funerary black. I was nearly about to excuse myself back through the door when I spied a young man at the opposite end of the vast room, dressed in a black three-piece suit, leaning wearily against an enormous marble coffin.

*“Is…is this Jom’s funeral?”* I managed to sputter out into the motionless crowd.

The fifty or so funeral goers remained silent. I could tell that something about my arrival was intensely befuddling, with looks of confusion painted over the attendee’s faces. Eventually, the shrill squeaking of poorly lubricated metal wheels broke the silence. The crowd parted to reveal an elderly woman in a wheelchair pushing herself towards me. She peered from side-to-side as she approached, observing the still petrified mourners staring at me with a look of disapproval.

*“Oh, would you relax? Go back to what you were doing. I’ll figure it out. Khepri save us, y’all would be startled shitless by a ladybug if it flew at you too fast,”* she croaked. Slowly, the figures in white pulled their attention away from me, and the lively chatter resumed, albeit at a much lower volume.

With the funeral reanimated, the elderly woman brought her eyes to mine, converting her scowl into a toothy grin. A wispy white dress hung loosely from her skeletal frame, giving her the appearance of a mobility-challenged banshee. The weight of a golden broach pulled the front of her dress forward at the collarbone, revealing the outlines of her upper ribs through thin, liver spotted skin. The accessory was about the size of a golf ball, and it depicted a beetle with what looked like a lotus flower etched onto its wings.

*“And you are, dear?”* she asked, settling in front of me by using a levered brake to halt the wheelchair’s momentum.

Based on the woman’s command of the other mourners and her wizened appearance, I made an educated guess as to her identity.

*“Hi…you must be Jom’s mother?”*

She nodded, her brow furrowing and her grin melting away as her head tilted up and down. The matriarch studied me intensely, her expression now twisted into one of confusion, like those of the mourners when they first saw me.

Relief fluttered through my chest. I briefly savored the pleasurable rush that came after the anxiety of a calculated risk. Then I smiled, took a generous inhale, and continued, launching into an ad libbed speech I had given countless times before.

*""It is nice finally to meet you. I…I wish it wasn’t under these circumstances, and I wish I knew your first name, but you know how private Jom can be-”*

I paused and forced a chuckle, letting tears well up as I broke eye contact - body language that screamed “*I’m struggling to use past tense now that he's dead, oh the sweet misery”*. A sigh fell from my lips, and then I picked up where I left off.

*“…you know how private Jom* ***could*** *be. I’m Tara. Your son and I were together for the last year or so. What’s your first name, ma’am?”*

Unexpectedly, I watched her eyes widen with some mix of alarm and disbelief.

*“It’s…it’s Akila”*

Without saying anything more, she abruptly pivoted her head and torso around, scanning the room for someone. Akila seemingly couldn’t locate them in the crowd, so she just started shouting a name.

*“Horus! Hoooorus! Could someone bring my grandson over?”*

The figures closest to us leaped into action, clearly fighting to be the person that fulfilled Akila’s request. Within seconds, one of the attendees, a hulking middle-aged man with biceps like tree trunks, returned with the kid in the black suit that had been previously leaning against the coffin, practically dragging the miserable looking young man by the wrist to his grandmother.

*“Ah! There you are, Horus.”* Akila cooed.

The boy barely responded, giving his elder an affirmative grunt. Before he was pulled from the crowd, I was laser focused on selling my story, constructing answers to questions that hadn’t even been asked yet. Seeing the anguish dripping off his features broke my concentration.

He looked to be in his early twenties, about six-feet tall, with a shaved head and a half crescent nose ring connecting his nostrils. His eyes were saturated with a deep, reflective sadness, his gaze empty and distant, like he was watching a memory rather than actually seeing anything physically in front of him. The corners of his mouth were collapsed into a rigid, immovable frown, the type of vacant expression that’s left over only after you’ve already completely exhausted every other painful emotion.

My heart broke for him. Whatever familial weirdness was currently on display, with the perfect white dress code and the inappropriately cheery atmosphere, the kid seemed like he was the only one experiencing genuine grief. His dad was dead, and he looked hurt and alone.

That empathy would last about another ten minutes.

*“Horus…this woman, Tara, is claiming to have been with your father, and she’s showing up here dressed like…dressed like that. Did you know anything about this?”*

*This might be game over,* I thought to myself. *Need to come up with a way to recover.*

He pointed his empty gaze at me. For a second, his eyes remained cold. But then, like the flash of blinding white light before the explosion of an atomic bomb, his expression instantly brightened and became animated. It wasn’t recognition that had reignited Horus; it was something else.

It was an idea. I didn’t know it at the time, but Horus was a pretty damn good improvisor as well.

*“Yeah, I know her. Dad mentioned her a few times in passing. Told me that she may or may not show up today. He wasn’t sure whether she really loved him or not, but I think he told her to show up if she did really love him.”*

He paused, calculating what to say next.

*“Tara’s an outsider. Dad wasn’t sure that we’d accept her, especially after what happened with Diane.”*

Akila turned back to me, now stone-faced and deathly serious.

*“Well, Tara, is all that true? You’re here because you loved my son?”*

I didn’t have long to contemplate the strangeness that was unfolding in front me, so I acted on instinct.

Terrible call.

*“…yes! Yes, I loved Jom. That’s why I’m here.”*

Horus nearly crumbled to the ground, his immovable frown ascending into a grin swollen with ecstasy.

*“Well…well alright then. That’s very noble of you, to come here of your own volition, espousing your love from my son. Bassel, could you escort Tara to the front? Show her where family sits? The eulogy will be starting in a few minutes.”* Akila replied.

The brawny gentleman with the tree-trunk biceps walked over, placing one massive arm forward to guide me and the other massive arm on my shoulder, as if to make sure I wasn’t going anywhere.

Behind me, I heard Horus cackling, doubling over and practically wheezing from whatever he found to be so goddamned funny.

\----------

There was a certain comedy to the way Akila had been positioned to deliver the eulogy. I couldn’t appreciate the humor of it at the time, with Bassel following me like a shadow, his looming presence causing a veritable chorus of alarm bells to ring loudly in my skull. But, in retrospect, I remember the juxtaposition of her in front of the casket being genuinely funny.

She was just so absurdly small, and the coffin was just so absurdly big. A marble torpedo behind a human earthworm, wrinkled skin flapping up and down as she spewed her ritualistic bullshit into the microphone.

*“Jom was a wonderful son, a loving father, and a devoted vicar of Khepri.”* Akila boomed, voice tinged with bursts of static from cheap speaker systems.

*“When Jom was on death’s door, we all felt his pain. In terms of renewal, he was without an ideal conduit. We all still grieve the loss of Diane, consumed by heresy, leaving him without love and Horus without a mother.”*

I turned to Bassel, pointing to my bladder and then pointing to the door. It was a lie; nature wasn’t calling. Not in that sense, at least. My subconscious was screaming, begging me to get the fuck out of that room through whatever means possible.

*Something is so fucking wrong,* I thought, waiting for Bassel to respond to my pantomiming.

He smiled, but it wasn’t reassuring. The grin was patronizing, revealing his own bitter amusement rather than his willingness to help, like he was watching his cat trying and failing to jump onto a forbidden table.

The man shook his head *no* a few times, and then placed a hand over my scalp, manually twisting my head back in the direction of Akila.

*“Little did we know, however, that in the nick of time, Jom found love. He was scared to divulge his love to us, because she is an outsider, just as Diane was. But, by being here, she has proven herself worthy of Khepri’s embrace, unlike the heretic.”* she said, gesturing a bony hand in my direction, long acrylic nails taking the shape of hawk talons.

*“Tara - we’re very grateful for your love, and your commitment to Jom. As you well know, passionate love is the best conduit. It's easier for Khepri to mold. But, of course, the love of youngest son will do if passionate love isn’t available. All that is to say, I’m sure Horus is very grateful, as well.”*

At that point, my heart was crashing against my rib cage like jackhammer, percussive and relentless. Bassel’s sturdy hand remained on my head, fixing my gaze on Akila.

Because of that, I couldn’t look away when the matriarch turned to face me, detailing what was to be my fate.

*“Your black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.”*

Sweat poured over my body, drenching me with sticky fear.

*“Are you ready, Tara?”*

Another white-clad figure appeared behind Akila, wrenching the heavy lid of the casket open.

Inside, Jom’s desiccated corpse laid flat, arms crossed over his shoulders, naked as the day he was born. But his body only covered half of the available space.

You see, the reason the coffin was so damn large is because it was built to house two separate people. The other half *had* been for Jom’s son, but now it was designated for me.

They were going to bury me alive in that marble tomb.

As if I even needed it confirmed at that point, I noted that the body had both of their hands. My actual assignment had lost one of his during their tour of Vietnam.

Hank had dropped me off on the wrong day.

When I didn’t move towards the casket, paralyzed by fear, Akila spoke into the microphone one more time, sharp static crackling through the speakers again like an electric tongue whipping invisibly through the air.

*“Bassel, it seems like Tara is having a bit of cold feet. Bring her over here, show our conduit how spacious it is inside, next to her beloved.”*

The man’s muscular paw pulled my head up, forcing me to my feet.

I tried to brainstorm even a fragment of an exit strategy, but for the second time that day, Horus broke my concentration.

Somewhere in the back of the room, I heard him snickering under his breath, downright elated with his unbelievably good fortune.

I wouldn’t let him distract me again after that.

\------

“*This…this is a huge misunderstanding…I didn’t know him…I didn’t know Jom…*” I sputtered, now only feet away from my waiting tomb.

No one responded. Not a peep of recognition from any of the attendees. I wondered if the words had actually left my mouth or if I had just imagined they did as Bassel forced me closer to the marble casket, inch by tortuous inch.

He was looming over me like a rain cloud, leading me forward with a burly arm wrapped tightly around my shoulders. At that point in my life, I hadn’t ever been married, which gave the slow, ritualistic procession towards the corpse in a box a certain perverse, darkly humorous quality. Like this was the closest *I’d* ever get to being a bride, given my sordid lifestyle. A sick joke; the universe chuckling alongside Horus, having a hearty laugh at my expense.

It was *almost* right, too. It had most of the pieces, at least. From a distance, it could have looked like a wedding, if you didn’t squint too hard.

Bassel, an older gentleman, guiding me towards my soon-to-be husband, giving me away till *death do us part*. Akila, the officiator, reciting the ceremonial words and ordaining the marriage. A crowd of loved ones, waiting patiently to witness the union.

All the cardinal signs of a marriage service; excluding my pulseless betrothed, of course. I looked at him and felt a frantic repulsion cascading through my body.

This was no wedding.

Jom had been completely drained of fluid, crumpling his skin and causing his body to curl slightly forward like a dead spider. A single, oversized nail pierced his skull, entering one temple and exiting the other, with bits of light reflecting off the shimmering metal visible in his eye sockets. If his eyes were present, they would have been shish kabobbed. They had been excised, however. I’d rather not speculate on whether someone performed that surgery pre- or post-mortem.

As I approached the casket, my thoughts and actions had stagnated, mired in the sheer impossibility of my circumstances. A paralytic disbelief of sorts; a desperate prayer to wake up from this fever dream.

A smell broke that stagnation. The scent of embalming fluid, ripe yet artificial like a cucumber pickled in bleach. When it hit my nostrils, my body sprang to life.

Formaldehyde worked like smelling salts that day.

“***Let me the fuck go***,” I shrieked, arcing my arm forward to send a pointed elbow behind me, crashing into Bassel’s diaphragm.

The blow stunned him momentarily, allowing me to squat down and out of the arm that had been tangled around my shoulders. It wasn’t enough, though. As I turned to run, he extended his leg in the direction I was escaping, tripping me with the heel of his white boot. I fell hard, face first, my forehead bouncing off the tile floor with enough force to cause my ears to ring.

Terror had made me forget the golden rule; the key to survival in the seedy underbrush where I earned my keep.

If they’re bigger than you, go for the eyes or the balls.

I moaned on the floor, concussed and bleeding from a fresh cut over my eyebrow. Before I knew it, Bassel had pulled me upright. My vision spun, making the room a disorientating blur of light and movement. In the meantime, the attendees had erupted, jumping from their seats and unleashing cries of anger and disgust, enraged by my treachery.

When I could focus, my eyes landed on Akila, still sitting in a wheelchair next to the coffin. Deep hurt twisted the old woman’s face; wrath burned in her eyes, yet her quivering lips showed her dejection, as if she couldn’t decide whether to scream or sob.

I bent down, making my face level with hers, trying to explain my outrageous circumstances over the shouting and caterwauling of the white-clad funeral goers.

Unfortunately, the words came out rushed. The coherency was spotty at best. There was too much to explain and not enough time to do it in.

*“Listen, Akila - my name is not Tara, it’s Robin. I work for an escort agency. My job involves attending funerals, sometimes pretending to be someone I’m not. They assigned me to go to a funeral for a man named ‘John’, but my driver must have dropped me off on the wrong day. I’m paid to lie. I didn’t know your son…”*

Somewhere in the crowd, I could hear Horus shouting at us.

*“Whatever she’s saying, it’s not true! She just doesn’t want to be a conduit anymore for Dad! Just like Mom!”*

Akila turned her head away from me, her reply bubbling with resentment.

*“You’re almost as bad as Diane, Tara.”*

*“Khepri have mercy on your soul.”*

\------

Despite my hysteric pleas, the coffin lid kept sliding. The harsh friction of stone moving against stone filled my ears, like the sonorous bellowing of an unseen God, welcoming me into their vast kingdom, excited to show me around.

A waning beam of light, a rumbling *snap* of the lid settling into place, and then there was nothing.

I'm plunged into blackness; unfettered, impenetrable, and all-consuming. Incomprehensibly perfect darkness, like the deepest ocean floor or the most distant reaches of space.

My mind spins. My heart quakes against my chest.

*The truth didn’t work.*

*I need something else.*

I beat my knuckles bloody against the marble lid, but it wasn’t any use. Although the casket was wide enough to fit two people, it was less than a foot high. I couldn’t swing my arm back far enough to generate meaningful force. Even if I could have, though, it wouldn’t have mattered. Not even Bassel’s tree-trunk biceps could have broken through solid stone. What chance did I have?

Still, I had to do something.

Eventually, one of my punches went off course, curving a little too far to my left. When it rebounded off the lid, it fell straight down, and the back of my hand clipped the dead man’s face before I could retract the limb to its original position on my chest. At that point, I stopped my futile barrage. I had been doing all I could to avoid touching the corpse. Now that I had, all of my energy and focus needed to be diverted to keeping myself from vomiting.

My mind replayed the memory of that sensation on a loop.

He was drier than I expected. Desiccated and stiff like rotten apricot or expired beef jerky. *Leathery* comes close to describing it. *Reptilian* comes even closer. Honestly, though, I can’t find something that fits just right. There just aren’t the words for it.

An unexpected *thunk* erupted under the tips of my shoulder blades, and I finally screamed. I had been trying to stay calm. Conserve every precious molecule of oxygen that I could. But the surprise broke my concentration, and I let loose gallons of pent-up terror into a single, earsplitting noise. I coughed and wheezed from the strain it put on my vocal cords, but as soon as I could, I revved up my larynx and started all over again.

Eventually, I ran out of steam, shrieks puttering out into choked wails and smaller fits of coughing. That exhaustion, thankfully, was helpful. The numbness was centering, in a sense. It allowed the more analytic parts of my brain a chance to take the wheel.

I needed a plan.

So, I listened closely, trying to use ambient noise to determine where I was. With my ears perked, I could appreciate a gentle tapping from somewhere above me. It sounded like the dainty pitter-pattering of drizzling rain, but it wasn’t consistent. There were pauses in between the tapping every few seconds or so.

The realization caused a surge of panic to explode through my chest like dynamite, but I maintained my composure. With time running thin, I couldn’t afford *not* to maintain my composure.

The *thunk* was the casket colliding with the bottom of a grave, and the tapping sound was dirt being shoveled onto me.

Onto *us.*

Just then, there was another sound. Something much closer, internal to the coffin, rather than the external tapping of the dirt against stone. A quick *pop* from somewhere beside me.

The creaking of a joint that hadn’t moved in quite a while.

\------

*“Oh Christ! Oh my God, he’s biting me!*

“*He’s scratching at my face, Jesus Christ let me the fuck out of here!”*

The tapping stopped. There was muffled conversation from somewhere outside the coffin, but I was too insulated to hear what was said.

I kept screaming.

*“Jom, I’m sorry. God, I’m so sorry!”*

*“He doesn’t want me here! He doesn’t want me here!”*

About a minute later, a tiny glimmer of light entered the casket, mirroring my evolving fate. Life snatched away from death at the eleventh hour; not much time to spare.

The lid fell to the ground with a heavy *thump*. Two blurry figures stood above me, but I couldn’t discern exactly who they were. The sunlight was blinding.

I must have looked like death. Long, four-fingered scratches all over my face and chest, horizontal swipes overlapping with vertical ones to form bloody cross-links. Wild terror stitched into my eyes. Ragged breaths like I was in the throes of an asthma attack.

A familiar voice from outside the grave rang down to me.

*“You said ‘he doesn’t want me here’? That’s what you said?”* shouted Akila.

I slowed my hyperventilation. My vision finally adjusted, and I saw two male attendees I didn’t recognize, eyes darting between me and Jom’s corpse. Inspecting us. By the time they had opened the coffin, Jom had stilled.

*“Yes…he started…he started whispering that to me. Then…then he attacked me.”*

There was a pregnant pause. The men looked up, waiting for their next orders.

*“Alright, then. He must be rejecting you. Guess he knows better than we do. If you weren’t his love, you wouldn’t be able to grant him renewal, I suppose. Pull her up here.”*

*“Someone get my grandson from the van, too.”*

\------

Once I was topside, Bassel became my watchdog again. There was discussion about what to do with me, but I didn’t wait for them to come to an agreement.

As fortune would have it, my captor was fairly well endowed, both his stem and his berries. Makes it all easier to find in a pinch.

I spun, grasped his family jewels, twisted them around their axis and pulled down, bringing Bassel to his knees. Once his head was within reach, I jabbed a thumb into his eye. Don’t think I blinded him, but he was certainly incapacitated at that point.

Before long, I was sprinting out of the graveyard. I passed Horus on my way out, writhing against the ground, two attendees dragging him by his wrists towards the hole his father was lying in.

He saw me, and I’m glad I had the presence of mind to wave at him as I was dashing by, a massive smile plastered on my face.

\------

Of course, Jom didn’t *actually* rise from the dead. That popping sound *was* his shoulder joint, but it made a noise because I accidentally knocked into it, not because he was moving it.

But that gave me an idea.

What I realized was that in order for those psychos to believe that I wasn’t who I had said I was originally, I needed objective evidence that I was an imposter. From what I could gather, they were trying to use me to resurrect Jom. But, like any cult, the process had rules.

*“Passionate love is the best conduit.”*

*“The youngest son will do if passionate love is not available.”*

*“Your black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.”*

I pretended it was real and imagined what might happen. Maybe Jom would attack me, desperate not to be buried with a con artist that wouldn’t actually provide him with new life because their sacrifice didn’t abide by the rules.

So, I scratched myself to hell and back. Spewed some bullshit about how he wasn’t actually dead. Made sure to sell the idea while not making my actual intentions obvious.

It worked, and I am beyond grateful that it did. That said, there’s no justice to any of it. Horus didn’t deserve to be in that pit either.

But, at the end of the day, I’m a survivalist.

Better him than me.

\------

I can’t believe all of that was thirty years ago. Time really is a wonder and a terror.

Never went back to the agency after that near miss. Partially because of how big they fucked up, stranding me there on the wrong day. Mostly, though, I left because I didn’t want Akila and Bassel to show up at some point, looking to snuff out a loose thread. I mean, I told Akila my first name and my occupation. I felt like it wouldn’t require too much legwork to find me if they really wanted to.

Packed my bags, moved across the country. Kept my first name but changed my surname. Got myself a husband and a few kids, as well as a job as a hairdresser. You know, I finally integrated into society. Left my niche behind, so to speak.

Over the years, the memories have grown a bit dusty. They don’t have as much terror associated with them as they used to. Which, in turn, has caused me to be plagued by nostalgia. A longing for the good old days, when I was really and truly alive.

Of course, that’s all delusional rubbish. I just needed a reminder; a sample of that long dormant fear.

I sure as shit got one.

About a week ago, I was in the middle of an appointment, going through the motions like I had so many times before. I finished up, about to walk away, when the client said something. A complete non-sequitur. Barely said a word before that.

*“You know, it’s the color that’s really the key.”*

I shot the client a funny look, because I had no idea what they were talking about. They had asked for a trim, not a dye job.

They saw my confusion in the mirror, gave me a lecherous smile, and continued.

*“Color is so important, love. It doesn’t get as much credit or attention as it used to, but that doesn’t mean it’s lost its potency. Quite the opposite, actually. It’s a resource that’s remained relatively untapped, which means the potency has accumulated, gathering over time. Now, my love, it's a wellspring.”*

*“What I’m saying is, it all would have worked just fine if you stayed with me. You really were dressed for the occasion, Robin.”*

And finally, I see it. He looks *like* Horus, but not exactly.

I hadn’t ever seen him with eyes before, but I suppose that man was Jom.

*“Call me sometime, okay? We have a few things to clear up.”*

He handed me a card on his way out. I’m staring at it now, fighting back nausea, feeling my heart slam against my ribs, rapid like the wings of a hummingbird. There’s a number on the back.

*“Amsi, museum curator for the Khepri Foundation. \[xxx-xxx-xxxx\]”*

Pure white on both sides.

Golden scarab on the back, with a lotus flower etched into its wings.

My sons 7 months, just started crawling. He smacks his head off the fireplace, the coffee table.. even the bloody wall. He headbuts the walls. Ive tried those baby proofing thing to put on corners, theyre bullshit, he still headbutts everything he still gets bruised and i still get judged. They told me i needed to make some changes as i was endangering my child. I can remove my fireplace, i can even remove my coffee table. I unfortunately cant remove the walls… so im out of options on that front. So we left the doors open and let him crawl around to see if he was bored in one room (followed him ofc) social services didnt like that fact we were letting him play in the kitchen as it isnt exactly “safe” oh and instead of headbutting walls he decided to headbut kitchen cabinets. So same problem. So then i thought let him play in the conservatory. Well they also didnt like that bc the dogs are in the conservatory alot (not when my son is crawling, theyre in the garden at that time) but theres paw prints. So its unsanitary. Oh…and guess what… he now headbuts the backdoor. So… looks like no matter what room i put him in hes always going to have some form of mark on his forehead. But im being made to feel like a crappy parent and i genuinely dont know what i can do. ",1,1749149900.0,Parenting,7,1.0,False

1l47fjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1l47fjz/bpd_wife_probably_was_the_cause_of_breaking_up/,BPD wife probably was the cause of breaking up the friendship between my bf and her hub,"My BF knew (let's call him X) for over 10 years; they were good pals. The only thing that my BF was complaining about was X's GF (let's call her Y). Due to her outburst, the issue she was causing and how many complaints he was hearing from X regarding Y's behaviour (Attacking with a knife, throwing objects, destroying a TV and other objects, and almost cheating)

When I started dating my BF, he told me about Y, mostly negative things. We met many times with X and Y; she was creating some drama occasionally, but she did open up to me and told me about her abuse when she was a child and other traumas. From there everything was great; she was talking to me quite often, and we went for a couple of drinks even and a cup of coffee. Nothing that could be alarming, but when I saw how she was treating X, I could not stay silent, so I spoke up regarding her behaviour that X is paying for everything (Y does not have a job, and without any higher education \[mind you, it is a European country, so higher education is free\], so X is paying for everything since they started dating and living together {7-8 years}), and it is quite unfair towards him that he is being treated like a piece of used condom because, he did not let you first through the door. Man, let me tell you, I wish I could rewind the time and never say it because the madness I've done is wild. But in short, she (Y) started accusing me of making everything hard for her, that I'm the issue and my BF should break up with me because I'm the cause of all evil. That I'm untrustworthy because I forgot to make her an appointment with the hairdresser (ignoring the fact that I organised the whole wedding dress and makeup appointments).

But somehow we were able to talk and make the peace sign (or at least we thought so, and that was one year ago). Because a couple of days ago when I tried to send her a message on Discord, I was blocked (nothing new, tbh), but my BF tried to talk to X, and...he is blocked too. Even more, we checked Steam, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and nope, he is not there, nor is Y. We were able to see that they still have our friends on FB and Discord, just not us. And there is a weird part. Nothing was saying that something is coming. Last week, my BF gave X a birthday gift; two weeks prior, they asked us to use our parking spot. No issue whatsoever.

Naturally, my bf tried to contact X via call (nope) and Discord (nope), so he used a second account and wrote him the message, ''Is everything alright?'' Well, X responds that he wants to cut the friendship with my bf because he is toxic; he doesn't like the way my bf is saying his feelings and opinion. X wanted to talk to my bf, to say it in person, but, well, I guess Y said no, but that is just my speculation.

The funniest and saddest part of this story. They asked us to be their witnesses (me and my boyfriend), and my boyfriend found out that they had a marriage already without telling anyone (they have no friends; we were the only friends they had as far as we know), and no family, probably because Y and X cut all contact with them. X took Y surname (she changed her name and surname, so X took new Y surname).

And during a period of two days after knowing them (me for 5 years, my BF for 10 years), we lost two acquaintances, in my opinion, in the worst way. Being ghosted in silence without any explanation nor signs that something was coming (deep down we knew, and our friends' circle knew it too, but the bliss of unknowing).",2,1749149834.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

is exactly what I want from my witchy cozy romance book.  
Witches without magic? A Powerful Warlock that is just enough arrogant that you believe he can change? Family that is complex and made you want more? YES!  
This book shot to my **GOD TIER in witchy books.**

**Overall Rating**  
★★★★★★★

*“Fear clutched my heart tight, but I thought of Draven and the way he made me feel when I was in his arms: so safe, so protected, so cared for. All the things I gave to others—he gave back to me.“*

**Synopsis**  
Meet Elspeth Moonflower. The Witch that just want to use her magic.  
Unfortunately, her grandmother has slight issues with providing blessing on her deathbed, and Elspeth and her three sisters ended up cursed and cannot use their magic. Which is really unfortunate if you live in a kingdom where you cannot live if you don’t have magic 😬  
Elspeth is trying really hard to protect her family from being expelled from Witch Lands or worst burned on stake (nope not kidding it is not only human intelligent idea to put people on fire witches do it to😬)  
They are pretty good at hiding in plain sight until they potion cart breaks down and strands them in the charming village of Thistlegrove. Here Elspeth meets Draven Darkstone – broody, arrogant, wealthy – a perfect example of why Elspeth never wants to marry. It is hate on first … talk? Well… Little both of them know that love and hate walks a thin line together.

**Thoughts**

I will scream about this book whenever I will have a chance. I am a fan of witchy romance book. One of my top favorite ones is Juliette Cross series The Stay A Spell. And Potions and Prejudice just hop on the shelf right next to her. Tee created such a cozy fantasy world with stakes that aren’t too high to break the cozy vibe, but enough to make me sit glued to my couch until 2am.

**Brooding warlock with golden heart**  
OMG! Give me a really brooding warlock and I will happily follow wherever he goes. Does he have a soft place for his family? I will gladly do whatever he wants. Give him some character growth and I will never leave him. Draven Darkstone is everything, that and more. I add him to my top 10 book boyfriends for sure.

**Overthinking witch without magic?**  
Someone called my name? I think I saw myself in Elspeth so many times that it is not possible to count. I was annoyed by her at some decisions just to see reasons why she acted like that moments later and decided that I would probably do the same. Honestly, I felt called out by both Elspeths and Dravens character flaws. Her overprotectiveness and his issues with parenting his younger sister just resonated so loud with me. I love heroins that feel real, that are not perfect or absolutely amazing at everything. And Elspeth is just one of my favorites.

Well, I am just terrible at reading descriptions. Give me a pretty cover and few phrases from the book, and I will gladly read it without so much as looking at the blurb. And I certainly did not read the part about this being a spicy book. So I was taken by surprise when I read probably one of my new favorite spice scenes at all in witchy world. Tee wrote it so hot I needed a few moments before going to sleep 😅 This is slow burn like slow slow burn I think they even thought about liking each other at 50% mark so don’t expect too much spice, but it is well written, and I let Draven talk to me like that anytime he wants 😏

In two minds about these frags-
1.Hawas Ice - This thing immediately reminded my of my Upsilon Shooting Star bottle.very similar smelling,but still a difference exists. Not able to call out what exactly is different.
2. Fattan - I absolutely loved the TDH sampler from Smytten, somebody mentioned this is 60-70% similar to that, but this smells synthetic AF although I can smell the vetiver notes.
3.CDNIM EDP - I get why this is mass male pleaser. Very much likeable to all men. I like the spicy notes.
4. Kaaf - Detergentish,but still very fresh.

Love at first whiff-
1. Afnan 9PM - This is the first time I'm smelling a gourmand fragrance. Boy o boy this made me fall in love. The masculine vanilla note just goes with my personality.
2. Khamrah Qahwah - The caramelish coffee goodness. Definitely a winter and date frag for me.
3. Turathi Blue - What exactly do I have to say? This would probably be my next daily driver.

1l47akf,https://www.reddit.com/r/salestechniques/comments/1l47akf/need_a_teardown_on_my_outreach_connections_are/,Need a teardown on my outreach. Connections are hitting. Replies aren’t.,"Been testing a shift from email to LinkedIn for outbound.

I lead trade sales for a company that works directly with the factories that manufacture furniture for premium brands like RH, Four Hands, Interiors Icon. Same specs, same build, just unbranded. Think: buying generic Allegra. Same product, minus the markup. 

The targets I’m going after are developers, designers and other trade professionals who would get value from direct factory access. Especially early adopters who value price-performance over labels, and don’t need ten calls and a pretty spec sheet to move.

I started with cold email. High open rate, basically no replies. So I pivoted to LinkedIn. I’m getting a decent rate of connections, but once I message them, it’s radio silence. 

I haven’t followed up much yet (still building the workflow), but before I do, I want to sanity-check the copy. Are my messages too soft? Not enough curiosity? Am I missing the mark entirely?

Here are some versions I’ve used. Rip them apart:

1-Hey Matt, I know you’ve seen what furnishing buildouts actually costs especially across multiple locations.  
  
We’ve been helping teams cut that down by going factory-direct. No minimums, extra markup and more control.  
  
If you’ve got a space in play, send the list. I’ll price it out so you can see the delta. Either way, good to be connected!

2-Hi Bethany!  
We haven’t met yet, but I lead trade at [Dupe.com](https://dupe.com/). Most people find us through our consumer site, but what we’re doing behind the scenes for designers is where things get interesting.  
We work directly with the factories producing for the brands everyone knows and get unbranded versions at cost.  
Would love to connect next week if you’re open. I’m Dallas-based too and always down for a coffee or lunch with another woman in the space.  
Cheers to Friday!  
Crystal

3-Saw you accepted. Thanks for that. Love meeting other women in the industry. My friend Sidney loves the team there and is the one who suggested I reach out!  
  
I work with design teams that want better control over cost without compromising the look or build quality. We go factory-direct. No minimums, no unnecessary markup.  
  
If you’re working on something now, I can price it out so you can see what it should actually cost.

And to give you an idea of the type of emails I was sending-

1-Hi Madeline,

Cristina Guia mentioned your name when we were talking about FF&E sourcing. She said if Dupe had been on her radar during her time at Kairoi, it would’ve saved a lot of budget stress.

Made me wonder.  
Would it ever be helpful to have a vendor who can match high-end pieces at factory-direct pricing without the brand markup?

Not sure if that’s even something your team is navigating right now, but thought I’d ask.

Crystal

Follow up- Hi Madeline,

Christina had mentioned you'd be someone who gets the nuance of sourcing and how frustrating it can be trying to untangle dealer markups from actual factory costs.

I’ve been working directly with manufacturers to help design leads get more clarity, more control and more room to work with especially on larger-scale projects.

If you’re ever curious to compare notes, I’d love to share what we’re seeing behind the curtain.

Best,  
Crystal

Follow up 2-Hi Madeline,

I know your inbox is full of vendors. But the way we’re approaching FF&E has been a real unlock for teams managing multi-unit specs.

It’s not just about pricing. We’ve built the logistics, QC, and timeline control around it so design leads aren’t left explaining vendor costs they didn’t set.

If you want to see what this could look like on a current project, I’ll work on it personally.

Crystal

Okay... tear it up please.

1l47aby,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l47aby/i_found_the_place_from_my_recurring_nightmare/,I Found The Place From My Recurring Nightmare,"As a kid, I had this recurring nightmare. It was the only dream I ever had more than once, and as such it’s stayed with me in vivid detail, even after many years.

I was in a dorm room, alone. Rows of single beds lined the walls, each with wrought iron frames, and faded sheets tucked with military precision. It was always as if I’d just woken up in one of the beds. The room was long and narrow. It had the general air of a set from some period drama about a Victorian orphanage. A bare window lay at the far end of the room, and cold moonlight spilled in through it. 

I would sit up in my bed and glance over at the window. I’d mechanically shift my legs out from under the covers, and drop, barefoot, onto wooden floorboards. I had no choice in this, nor could I rationalise my actions. I was drawn to the window. Bluish light streaked across the dark wood beneath me.

I’d pad my way between the beds and over to the window. The room I was in formed the top floor of an old building. It could’ve been a boarding house, but the contents and purpose of any rooms beyond my own were not known to me. There was only the dorm, the beds, and the scene through the window. 

Tranquil was the perfect word for it. A silent beach stretched away into the distance, with gentle waves rolling in from a vast, dark sea. Tall swaying grass formed its own sort of ocean to my left, and to my right the water spread out to the horizon. A brilliant full moon coated everything in a pale light, and several fluffy clouds drifted past, limned in silver by its glow. It was beautiful.

And then movement from below would catch my eye. In the distance I would spot a man, far enough away to seem small. I’d never see where he came from; he’d always be about halfway down the beach when he drew my attention. He was frantically sprinting down the beach, shin deep in the water, towards my building. He would fall, disappearing entirely beneath the waves, only to drag himself back up again to resume his frenzied run. Something about it was animalistic. I couldn’t make out any specific details about him, but somehow I knew that it wasn’t fear that drove him. 

I would always linger for a minute, dumbfounded, as I watched the sprinting figure get closer to the building. The only noise was my own breathing. I’d watch him tumble soundlessly into the water, practically running on all fours for a moment as he dragged himself upright again. 

It was at this point that I’d realise there was only one place that man could be heading. He was coming here. My childish mind could only find one solution: to return to the bed I’d stepped out from, pretend to be asleep, and hope desperately that he wasn’t coming to this room, that I wouldn’t be found, that I’d be safe beneath my covers. 

I’d lie there for what could’ve been minutes or years, in the stagnant cold of the dorm room. There were times when I’d try to will myself awake, where I must have realised that it was a bad dream, but I’d find no such reprieve. I’d shiver there in the dark beneath my covers, in denial of the fact that the stranger was coming, but always knowing ultimately that he’d find his way to me. 

And then the door would creak open. I would go deathly still, listening, but hearing nothing. A weight would sink onto the end of my bed, and I would actually feel the mattress depressing as if someone was sitting there. 

I don’t know how or why, but I would find the resolve to pull down the covers and look. It was as if the nightmare couldn’t end until I did. And I always would. 

He’d be sitting at the end of my bed, facing towards the window. Slowly, wordlessly, he would turn his head in my direction. As the moonlight caught his head it appeared featureless; he looked like a shadowed mannequin, with only the faintest implications of a human face. 

As he turned, a small spot on his forehead seemed to turn yellow. The spot grew in size and intensity, until it was glowing, like a tiny torch pushed up against a cheek from inside. The spot became a bump, and then it grew into a bulb shape, until the glowing bulb pushed through the skin and emerged on a stalk to dangle in front of his face. The faint, yellow light it emitted was warm, creating a stark contrast against the blue darkness and his pallid flesh. As the glow spread, I discovered that he did in fact have eyes: small, round eyes, mostly covered in some sort of pale film, and utterly black beneath. Where shadows touched his mouth it left the impression of a gaping maw, yet beneath the light were pale lips. Light and shadow danced about his shifting features as he leaned towards me, causing the light source to dangle between us.

And that is when I would wake up. 

# ***

Today I’m travelling for a work conference. I’d just booked myself into a hotel in a part of the country I’ve never been to before. The room was nice enough, although the dated floral patterns on every surface were not to my taste. Having a busy schedule, I was planning to leave my luggage in the room and immediately head out. I dropped my bag and started typing out a message to my colleague, but my sentence came to a gradual halt as my vision was tugged towards the window. 

I stood there, holding my phone, looking out across a quaint little town. An overpowering sense of deja vu washed over me. Dropping the phone onto the bed, I stepped over for a better look. Suddenly I was a child again, padding across wooden floors in my dreams. Here I was, looking out across that same beach, except it was an overcast day.

It wasn’t some isolated, geometrically dubious building in a sea of grass, sand and water. Beyond the grass lay the streets and buildings of an unremarkable seaside town. Far from the cold wooden floors of an imaginary dorm, I was sinking into an aged carpet that looked like it should reek of cigarettes. But that view was unmistakably the same. 

I was immediately at a loss. Something about this experience had me unsettled. But what was I supposed to do about it? My company paid for the room, and beyond that, I’m an adult! I wasn’t about to ditch a work conference because the view from my window resembled a nightmare I used to have. I spent a few minutes rationalising and coming up with a million ways in which I was being an idiot. Then, shaking my head, I left to go about my day.

That day was filled with introductory sessions and polite meals. I made small talk and chuckled and ate less food than I wanted. I knew a few of the other people attending, but not closely. It wasn’t until I opened the door to my room that night, that everything came flooding back. As soon as I glimpsed the window, my stomach became a pit of dread. The lights from the hotel corridor made the darkness seem to press itself against the glass. I tentatively closed the door behind me and locked it. Now in darkness myself, I could clearly see the night sky. Taking a deep breath, I walked over to the window. 

There was considerable cloud cover that night, and a crescent moon. The yellow pollution of streetlights bled into the cold blues and blacks of the night air. The ocean was more or less a void, the boundaries of which were only defined where light caught the edges. 

I was being an idiot, as I was fond of telling myself. But I couldn’t shake a slight feeling of unease. I’d never seen this beach before, not in person, but this view was practically seared into my memory. I’d occasionally remember that nightmare, but it had been a long time since I’d thought about it. And it felt like it was unfolding again in front of me. 

It took a few hours to pass out, with the aid of a glass of wine and trashy TV playing quietly in the background. I was in a building full of people, surrounded by a town full of people, far from that isolated terror from my childhood. Once I was out, it was uneventful. 

I woke the next day without remembering having dreamt at all. I felt somewhat refreshed, and a bit childish for being anxious. It was as if I’d been expecting an unwelcome answer to some question I was reluctant to ask. But it was just a bland night on a boring trip, in fairly pleasant surroundings. I was almost disappointed. 

The next day was much like the first, but I was distracted. I sat through lengthy presentations and friendly conversations, but my mind kept drifting back to that stretch of beach. Yesterday, for a moment, I’d felt some sort of creeping fear. I was like a child poised, hand above the lightswitch, about to race up darkened stairs. By now I was almost frustrated, and I couldn’t begin to explain it to anybody at the conference. Imagine being slowly pulled to the top of a rollercoaster, feeling that buildup, knowing that the climb meant a huge drop was about to follow. And when you reach the top, the ride just ends instead. You’re left without a resolution, and if anything, a long walk back down again.  

Upon returning to my room the second night, I stayed at the window for a while. I mostly wanted to forget about the nightmare and move on, and rationally, I knew that was the only real option. But I couldn’t help but replay it in my mind, thinking about the figure on the beach, wondering if there might be some reason or meaning behind any of it. I toyed with the idea of trying to research… something, but where would I even begin? I even thought about messaging a friend, but I could see how crazy it would sound before I started. I was left with an old nightmare and a distinct lack of purpose. 

Without being able to form any conclusions, or even make sense of why I was so affected by this stretch of beach, I was restless. I’d already spent too much time thinking about this nonsense. I’d found a bit of land that looked similar to a dream I’d stopped having years before. How unique could a beach look, anyway? My frustration with myself fed into my general low mood and mild anxiety. It was a while before I was able to finally crash.

I was standing on the moonlit beach, watching black waves lapping silently at the shore like a searching tongue on an unknown food. I didn’t turn back but I knew the town behind me was gone, replaced instead by forests of rhythmically swaying grass. The ocean filled my focus as though I were zooming in. About twenty feet away, a faint yellow glow began to spread across the surface. My feet were planted firmly in the sand, and I could not turn my gaze away. Pale flesh noiselessly breached the surface, forming the top of a head, bringing with it the yellow glow. The head slid out of the water slowly and perfectly, and I realised the water had gone unnaturally still, that there wasn’t even a ripple as the being emerged. Reflected stars dotted the surface of the water around the glowing head, and the head’s mirror image stretched across the water in unison, its own glowing dot twinkling amid the stars. 

We locked eyes. He stopped his smooth ascent once his chin broke the surface. The glow from his light remained pressed against his forehead from inside. He started to sink again, his fleshy eyes unblinking, a dull black against his pale countenance. The glow stayed just beneath the surface. 

I took a step towards the water.

I was drenched in sweat when I woke up. My immediate anxiety quickly decrescendoed into a quiet, pervasive unease. It had been years since my recurring nightmares, but this was the first time I’d seen him again, and the first time the dream had been different. I told myself that it had been at the forefront of my mind, which is why it had happened. But I was deeply unsettled despite my attempts to reassure myself. 

Thoughts of that dream stayed with me throughout the day, whenever I had a long enough pause to think. I could recall in incredible detail the way his yellow light suffused the water around him, the way it cast shadows about his face as he emerged, the reflections creating an impression of a second head stretching away from him. It made me shudder. 

One of my coworkers caught my eye over lunch. I could tell by the way he looked at me that I must’ve been an awful sight. 

“Hey, you alright mate?” He asked, a hint of genuine concern in his tone. His name was Ben.

“Not bad at all, and you?” I replied with a sigh that I fought to suppress. 

“Had a bit of a wild one last night, did you?”

“Oh yeah, that’s me. I get one whiff of these conferences and it’s like blood in the water. I just go absolutely feral.” We chuckled together.

“I’m gonna find you in a loincloth later, I just know it.” 

“I’m already wearing one under these clothes.” I replied. We laughed for a minute. “Nah, I just had a shit sleep last night. I had this awful nightmare.” I had to tell someone, to normalise it, and Ben had always been good natured. 

“I’m due a nightmare or two after this conversation.” He retorted. I scoffed as he tried to hold back a grin around mouthfuls of food. 

“You ever had a recurring dream?” I asked as we ate. He shook his head.

“Nah, is that what happened last night?” I could tell he was only humouring me, and I couldn’t blame him.

“Kinda. I had these nightmares when I was a kid. Seems like they might be starting up again.” 

“Sorry to hear that, mate. Maybe you could do with going a bit feral tonight, eh? Just don’t go too crazy.” He broke out into a smile as he spoke.

“Feral enough that the loincloth makes sense, not so feral that I lose the loincloth.”

“You mean transcend the loincloth.”

“Fucking hell,” I laughed, “This is not normal. You are not normal.” We were cackling as we headed back to the conference room. 

Given his lackluster response I decided not to press the issue. We’d never been ones for serious conversations with each other, so I hadn’t expected him to be some kind of dream guru and solve my problems. It felt good just to talk about it to somebody, like somehow it had helped to bring me back to reality. 

Ultimately, I felt that something in what Ben had said was sage advice; I stuck around with some colleagues after the last session of the day, and we went to a local pub. It was pleasant in a mundane way, as I shared a few drinks with mostly older acquaintances in a relaxed atmosphere. I let myself get slightly too drunk and left a bit later than I should have. It was my penultimate night on the trip, and I was finally relaxed. I still felt an anxious tinge as I glanced at the window in my room, but I was fairly confident that I was drunk enough to avoid dreaming. 

A low wave crashed into my legs and I gasped violently, instinctively jumping back and tumbling onto the sand. The water was freezing, and my feet were bare. I looked around frantically, confused and panicking. The streetlights of the town seeped into the night air behind me. The only sounds were the breeze and the crashing of waves. Cautiously I pulled myself to my feet and tried to regain some composure. What the fuck was I doing out here? I could see the last of my footprints that brought me here, before they were washed away by the encroaching tide. 

I turned to face the hotel, which was on street level near the end of the beach, a short distance away. Cautiously, I looked around at the water, half expecting to see the figure from my dreams. 

I was decidedly alone. I set about trudging back to the hotel, glancing over at the water occasionally. I was shaken. I’d never experienced sleepwalking before. I don’t know how I managed to leave my room and make it all the way down to the water before waking. 

The hotel reception was mercifully empty, and we’d been given a code to get back in after hours, which I had thankfully memorised. I was dripping wet and covered in sand, and I must have left a trail all the way up to my room. The door was ajar when I reached it. I gave it a push, reached in and hit the light. It was empty. The bedding was strewn across the floor. I hit the light again, and took one more glance out through the window. For a brief moment, I swore I saw a faint pinprick of yellow light just beyond the shore, before it sank into the darkness. 

# ***

I was too unsettled to go back to sleep, and I had a few hours to kill before the day officially started. I briefly looked up sleepwalking and its causes, and resolved to contact my GP if it happened again. Looking into nightmares was less than helpful, and I wound up skimming through a few pop psychology listicles of common nightmares and their interpretations. The nightmares were clearly affecting me more seriously than I’d originally cared to admit. But I still didn’t have any real solutions - I didn’t even have any real questions, just a sense of dread and a series of perfectly explainable events. Vivid nightmares, coincidences, and now a stress induced sleepwalking episode. 

 It was supposed to be my last night in this town. I just had to get through it and I could go back to my routine life. 

I was a shell that day. It was long. I felt as if I’d slipped through the cracks into some conference dimension, as if this were my reality now, that my only recourse would be the short walks from one conference room to the next. Lunch came around at a crawl. 

“Wow. You look like you lost your loincloth last night.”

“What?” I exclaimed, looking up to see Ben sitting across from me.. “Oh!” It took a moment for the context of what he was saying to catch up to me. “Nah, I mean, I got a bit drunk, but-”

“Did you have nightmares again?” He asked. I nodded.

“I went fucking sleepwalking, man.” 

“Seriously?” The surprise in his tone was immediately apparent.

“Yeah. Never happened before.”

“Do you… need help or something?” Ben didn’t try to hide his concern.

“Nah, I looked it up. Probably stress. If it keeps happening I’ll get a doctor’s appointment.”

“Hmm. Where did you wind up?” His question made me pause for a moment.

“I was on the beach.”

“You what?” 

“Right by the fucking sea. That’s when I woke up.” 

“That’s crazy!” Ben was leaning in now, his voice hushed but wracked with worry.

“Yeah! I know it is!”

“You got all the way from your room to the bloody sea?” 

“Apparently!”

“Did you have your loincloth on?”

“Oh, fuck off!” I laughed, appreciating the break in tension. 

“Seriously though, that’s really weird. Lucky you didn’t go swimming. Maybe you should, like, barricade your door or something.” I thought about it for a minute and nodded.

“Yeah, definitely barricading my door.” 

We left and I caught him casting a sideways glance at me, with an expression of unfiltered worry that I’d never seen on him before. I was worried too, but in a very mundane way; I was clearly under large amounts of stress, and I needed to do something to try and manage those levels. 

After the work sessions came to a merciful close, I drove over to the local supermarket and picked up some over-the-counter sleeping pills. A temporary solution to get me through this last night. I could work on managing stress properly once I was home. 

As soon as I was back in my room, I pushed the armchair over to the door and wedged it under the handle to prevent my escape. I took a couple of the pills, and I played a guided meditation video from my phone. By the time it finished I felt heavy and relaxed. I put on some soft, ambient music, and drifted calmly off to an early sleep. 

I took a deep lungful of salt water. I forced my eyes open and scrambled with my hands and feet, looking for purchase or sense or anything. In a wild frenzy, my hands found sand. Running on pure instinct I pushed against it with my feet, using all my strength. I was in shallow water. The shore was in front of me. I thrashed my way over to it, shouting wordlessly, staggering and retching. I collapsed on dry land as soon as I reached it. 

It was a few minutes before I was breathing normally again, and I could finally slow down enough to think. The beach was calm. The only sound was the waves. I must have pulled the chair away from the door in my sleep. I couldn’t believe I’d found my way out here again, unconscious. I was angry and scared in equal measure. After a while I pushed myself into a sitting position. 

I saw it. I watched the top of a head slip back into the water. I saw its glow diminishing as it descended from the surface. I scrambled to my feet, and I ran. 

I ran in a blind panic. I had never been closer to animal as I fled. I was barely bipedal. I crashed into the ramp up to street level and I threw myself up it. It was only after I reached the perceived safety of streetlights that I slowed. I turned to look back at the beach, and saw nothing unusual. 

With no sign of immediate threat, I stopped to compose myself. Was I supposed to just return to my hotel room like nothing happened, and try to move on from this? Was my reality fundamentally changed, or just the way I was gripping it? I shook my head. I was getting too philosophical, too fast. What I needed to do was dry off and think through my next actions. 

I punched in the code and dripped my way through reception. I dragged myself up the stairs, my mind racing, fear and adrenaline still very much in control. I was replaying the events in my head endlessly, almost drowning, watching the shape disappear into the water, the dreams I’d been having. I stopped when I instinctively pushed against my door and realised that I couldn’t get in. I stood there, lost, still dripping wet. I gave the door several more pushes, as if it would unlock itself upon my insistence. I checked the pockets on my pyjamas and found them empty. 

“Oh, fuck.” I whispered to myself. After another minute or two of denial, I practically slid back down the stairs and across the empty reception. I didn’t know what time it was or when the staff would be available. Now I was at a loss. I found myself heading back outside, and around the side of the building. Standing on the side facing the beach, I examined the windows until I spotted the one to my room, three floors up. It was wide open, translucent white curtain fluttering in the breeze like an overplayed ghost movie. 

Did I climb?

Judging by the fact that it was still dark, I guessed that I still had a few hours before daylight. I contemplated trying to climb up to my window, but I was certain that I didn’t have the skill, even if it was possible to do. I let myself back into reception, and paced for a moment. There was a bell at the counter. After some deliberation, I rang it, and hoped. Nothing.

I knew that there was complimentary tea and coffee at a station on the ground floor, so I made my way over there. The milk wasn’t stocked, but I helped myself to a black coffee, and I sat nursing it. Today was the last day of conference events, and from the itinerary it was just a short, wrap up session, and everybody was set to leave by lunch. I decided there was no way that I could attend. Once there were staff around, I’d ask them to help me get into the room, I’d send an apologetic message to my coworkers, and I’d leave. 

I spent the next few hours refilling my coffee, pacing around, and trying to decide if I was losing my mind. I was mercifully dry when the first member of staff walked past.

“Excuse me, I’m so sorry to bother you, but I’m locked out of my room.” She was obviously confused, but I told her that I had problems with sleepwalking and she was understanding. She handed me a replacement keycard from reception, and I rushed back up the stairs to my room. The door beeped affirmatively when I swiped the card, but the handle was caught on the chair on the other side. 

“Oh, fuck.” I whispered. I had visions of trying to nonchalantly walk back past the receptionist, barefoot and in pyjamas. I thought about trying to scale the wall before I’d even consider asking for help. I decided it was less mortifying to at least try and force the door first. Thankfully, after jiggling the handle and shouldering the door a few times, the chair shifted, and I was able to let myself in. 

I stared at the open window. Worrying about asking for help, and getting into my room, had been tangible problems that I could focus on; helpful distractions. Now I was confronted with the window again. Did I climb out, or was I carried? 

A deep red sun was leaking colour out from the horizon. It carved a red path across the water and pushed into the blue above. I stared down at the beach as if I might see him there, running towards me as he would in my childhood nightmares. Instead it was tranquil. 

I gathered my things quickly, repacking them messily into my suitcase and bag. I had enough foresight to carry out one last sweep of the room for any forgotten belongings. Finally I went to pull the window shut, when I was stopped dead in my tracks. A line of damp sand had been pressed into the window frame. I leaned out and looked around, but found nothing else.

I practically jogged my way through the hotel, and out to my car, stopping only to return the keycards and check out of reception. I threw everything hastily into my passenger seat and jumped into the driver’s side. Before setting off, I quickly typed out a message to my coworkers. In it I apologised for leaving, explained that I was unwell, and that I’d see the ones who worked in my building the following week.

With that taken care of, I started the engine and peeled out from the carpark. I hit play on my chill driving playlist and tried my best to relax and enjoy the drive. It was a scenic route between this and my hometown. I had a few hours of driving ahead of me.

By the time I was passing more familiar surroundings, I was exhausted. It felt as if I’d been on the road for days. Beyond that, I had a sort of background panic that refused to let up, that would return to the foreground whenever I ran out of distraction. I was becoming a nervous wreck.

I more or less fell through my front door in relief, glad to have put some distance between myself and whatever it was that had happened on the trip. I had a weekend to recover before returning to work. There wasn’t a doubt in my mind that I’d be reaching out for my doctor, but for today at least, I was going to rest. I showered, cooked, and bounced between various sitcoms until I must have crashed on the couch.

I was knee deep in river water, a dark, murky brown. As soon as I came to, I shouted in frustration, on the brink of tears. The river was an hour’s walk away from my house. I glanced around at the rows of trees, edges gleaming with moonlight, a wall of shadow formed between them.

“Oh god, oh god, oh god,” I whimpered, about to turn and wade back to the riverbank. I realised then that my feet were stuck, sunk into the mud of the riverbed. 

I bent down to grab my left leg in an effort to free it, tugging at it frantically, my face near the water.

I froze.

A glow was starting to form in the water, directly under my face. I stopped breathing. It grew stronger and brighter and a shadowy figure became visible beneath it. The top of a head breached the calm surface. Black eyes peering through sinewy flesh stared up at me. In so many ways I was stuck. It was everything I could manage to bring myself into an upright position. The head was fully emerged from the water now, its bulbous light dangling from the stalk on its forehead. The skin was almost translucent, thin blue veins like spiderwebs under the flesh. The light was so warm. Fingertips breached the surface near the face, long and pale and questing. They were followed by a hand.

I found myself reaching out with my own hand. Slowly, rigidly, in jerking movements as if my body’s natural reflexes were being overridden. I couldn’t cry or scream.

My hand met the cold, wet, pallid flesh, and it was like I’d carefully reached in to set off a beartrap. The hand wrapped around my forearm with impossible strength, the face disappeared with the sudden urgency of a fishing bobber yanked beneath the surface, and I was being pulled into the river.

My reflexes finally kicked in and I started to fight, instinctively leaning back as far as I could, my arm burning with pain. My feet were still dug into the riverbed. I reached with my free hand and tried to pry the fingers from my wrist, but it was futile. I felt my shoulder dislocate, and I screamed. Suddenly the thing let go and I fell backwards. It was a ruse. Suddenly it was on me, even as I fell, to make sure I was fully submerged in the water. It held me down, its light the only visible thing through the silt that our struggle had kicked up. Every part of me was screaming, my lungs were burning. One of my hands was pinned again, but my free hand followed that light and found its face. I jabbed a thumb several times until I met its eye and pushed as hard as I could manage. In the struggle my feet had somehow become freed. I was dragged again for a short distance by my captured hand. Then I felt a horrible crunch that will stay with me always. 

The burning sensation of pain became an inferno. I screamed. But then it was dark, and I was alone, and somehow I was free.

I pushed myself up and emerged from the water into the night air. First I gasped, then I screamed again. I looked down at my hand. It had been ripped off at the wrist. More like bitten off.

Somehow I fought my way out of the river, screaming and bleeding. I dragged myself through the trees and onto a road. I don’t remember being found. 

I came to in a hospital bed, my stump bandaged, high as a kite on pain meds. The hospital staff knew where I was found, that I was covered in wet mud. I had to tell them that I was attacked, and I repeated the same thing to the police. Of course it was met with disbelief, based on the nature of my wound. I would tell them I wasn’t sure how it happened, that it was over so fast, that my memories were a jumbled, hazy mess. What else could they do? They searched the river for my hand and found nothing.

I’m heavily medicated now. Sleep and I have a complicated relationship. I haven’t dreamt of that glowing man since the trip, nor have I woken up in any strange places. But I still see those eyes, whenever I close mine in the dark. I see the warm glow from his stalk as it emerges from murky water.

Sometimes I swear I see yellow light hitting my curtains from outside.

I've noticed that the flavor profile for many of them are the same: medium roast, slightly sweet with nutty undertones. It's a distinctive flavor that I've never been able to replicate at home.

On busy travel days, I've even gotten lattes with 3 or 4 shots of espresso, and they are pleasantly strong with no bitterness - they're remarkably smooth! 

I don't expect to get that same exact quality with my Nespresso, but now that I'm home, I'm really missing the flavor of that espresso. Before my recent trip, my daily lattes at home were excellent - but now I've been ruined by all the new espresso I've tried! 

Are there any pods with a similar flavor profile? For reference, we have an original Nespresso, not the Vertuo.

I felt like I put in more effort to kept the flow going, but he agreed to a second date.

We both have space tattoos and like outside activities, so I was thinking of doing a stargazing picnic for the second date.

I want to do something to help conversation flow more freely, so I was going to propose the following: We both bring a list of 5 songs we like and want to show the other person, and 5 questions we want to ask the other person. So person 1 picks a song for us to listen to, tell the other why they like it, and then ask one of their questions. You have to answer your own question as well. After that, person 2 repeats the same process.

Between 10 songs, 10 questions, some light food, a few beers, and a starry night sky, I think it would make for a more personal/romantic date.

Is this too cheesy? Or are there any recommendations on how to make it better?

for questions, I was thinking:

•	⁠what do you think about space, and our place in the universe?
•	⁠what do you consider your biggest fear?
•	⁠if you were to die tomorrow, what do you think would be your biggest regret.
•	⁠if we go on more dates, what would you like to get out of our interactions?

That’s only 4, so I’m open to suggestions. I’m cool with changing my questions altogether as well. I don’t date often so I don’t know what is a normal second date questions. My goal is to get to know them more intimately, and vise versa.

We live in Vegas, and it might be too hot to go outside, even late at night, so I am open to suggestions on other places we can do to do this activity.

I really liked him, so all help will be appreciated.",0,1749149052.0,dating,7,0.5,False

1l47230,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l47230,30m/ Ohio USA,"Name’s John. I’ve been in the comments for a while. It’s time I let y’all know more about me!


- Area of study/work:
Finishing a 2 year Electro-Mechanical Engineering degree. I work in material science as a lab technician, testing different materials for defense and aerospace companies.

- Hobbies/interests:
I like music of all genres, movies (mainly sci-fi and action), and exercise. Love going to concerts a couple times a year, or spend a nice evening at the jazz club. 
Love seeing movies in theaters, or just crashing on the couch at home to rewatch Star Wars or something. And I work out regularly at the gym, with some rock climbing and hiking at times. 

I roast coffee, would consider myself a decent barista but my roast game hits different. 

I volunteer my time in local politics as a county leader and delegate for the Libertarian Party of Ohio. Also serving in church, and an equine therapy program where I tend to the horses and barn maintenance. 

Lastly, my weakness is a good conspiracy theory 🛸 👽 

- Tell us a bit about your Christian journey:

Grew up in church, gave my life to this journey of following Jesus when I was 18-19. Not that faith is never hard, but there have been times where my faith was challenged. But God is good and used all that to strengthen my trust in Him. Currently am trying to get back to reading the Bible at least once a day, and journal sometimes in the week again. Those activities heavily influenced my growth and maturing my faith. 

Learning to see myself as God sees me has been the biggest part of the journey. That is what helped me to see my own potential, leading to achieving my weight loss goal of losing over 100lbs!

- What sort of person are you looking for?
A woman who has a good character, a bit quirky/ ok with not fitting into a mold. 
Has a good sense of humor, loves music, and has a good heart for seeing past someone’s appearance and flaws. 
Someone who is understanding and shows grace. 

As you may notice… I have tattoos which are an artistic expression of myself, interests, and experiences. You don’t have to love them but I don’t want any judgement for having them or my piercings. 

All these things I ask for, good character, humor, quirky, a creative and non-judgmental. These make up a large part of my personality too. 

- Age range:
24-35 with some wiggle room. I don’t mind dating older or younger than me, so long as we have a good chemistry and communication. The other thing is I want to be a father, and my wife should want to be a mother. 

- Would you be willing to do long distance/relocate?

I cannot relocate, now. For reasons being my schooling needs to be done with. As well my job is very important when thinking long term. The benefits and work experience are highly valuable to me. Maybe I’ll change my mind, but I’m pretty dedicated to staying in Cincinnati. 

I’ve done long distance, and it’s not for me.
Much rather stay close to home. If you live near Cincinnati, Columbus, or Dayton OH. Indianapolis IN, Louisville or Lexington KY. Those are all 2 hours away from me in Cincy with exception of going up to 4 hours away. Basically, I want to be able to drive to see you and be back home in the same day.

I have not been diagnosed with anything officially (I think?) but I had a sleep study done 10 years ago. My doctor just skimmed the report and I was told I need 12+ hours of sleep a day to feel rested? I’m thinking it’s hypersomnia. I also now have sleep apnea on top of it along with hypothyroidism, low iron, and a baby so the world is against me. 😅

Anywho, they prescribed me a couple different things to try. I take modafinil most days but they wear off after taking them for so many days/weeks and then I alternate with another medication I can’t recall the name of. 

I’ve tried pretty much everything until recently I learned that eating low carb can help some people so I’m giving that a whirl. Has anyone found this helpful? Also caffeine has no affect on me but I do enjoy coffee and pop, wondering if anyone has cut those out and maybe noticed more energy?

1l470ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PrestigiousCow7047/comments/1l470ev/foggy_clarity/,Foggy Clarity,"PREFACE: (I just want to know, from all angles, I just want to know; this is a fragment of a thought pattern I experienced today. this is my first time writing anything like this; kinda of lengthy, also, but it feels so monumentally profound compared to my other experiences, that I may have something in common with at least someone, (hey I can dream, can’t I?) I’m looking for insight on how to organize and compartmentalize thoughts, info, emotions etc.
I am aware there may be typos or contradictions, etc. I edited as fast as I could as I was thinking and typing. I’m working on expanding my vocabulary and knowledge in general; graduated high school, veteran, college graduate with bachelors in radiologic sciences (I just feel like I needed to mention this to give the reader an idea of where my vocabulary or knowledge is at its current level, that is if you can correlate or connect me as a person to my intelligence with and without the education and experience vs lacking those examples, and determining if those have a significant impact or and impact at all on my intelligence - for context). These are things I’ve written out for Ai to help me analyze, understand or point me in the direction of understanding which ultimately leads to more questions, but that’s a different path for a different time..TIA for your patience and understanding.)

I felt as if something switched in my brain, I don’t remember how long ago exactly (~3 years?). I’m not quite sure if the switch was flipped on or off. I felt as if I’ve never made a decision in my life for myself about myself without taking into consideration anything external input from others whether inquired about or unsolicited or unspoken. I recall stating as if I had “developed adult onset ADHD.” I slowly felt the tangled mess slowly unravel. Emotions heightened to extremes, sometimes without warning. Info dumping, loss of motivation, decision making abilities thrown onto the ground the stomped on, squishing it like a bug into the dirt. Awareness of internal processes, feeling as if I can pinpoint a nerve if I’m having pain, noticing breath holding or chest tightness during emotional overwhelm and releasing it as a reset, adjusting environmental factors like temperature or airflow in response to subtle internal discomfort, feeling sudden physical agitation or stillness when mentally overstimulated followed by a need to regulate through small rituals or movement, feeling emotions physically (e.g. dread = writhing ball of dark smoke-like string in a huge tangle in epigastric region), monitoring posture, voice, or facial expression in social settings tied to self-perception and others’ reactions, and experiencing waves of energy or heaviness in the body linked to mood shifts, memory recall, or decision-making. I can go to work as a medical professional for 12+ hours, but don’t have the motivation or do have “too many options too tasking to complete” once I’m home and/or off work. A PB&J? Forget about it, getting out the loaf of bread, untying the twistie, selecting two slices, hopefully not moldy, retrying the twistie, returning bread to pantry, find peanut butter in pantry, obtain knife, etc you get it. I need a recipe-like task list for all individual tasks.

I dove deep into potential Autism and ADHD diagnoses characteristics, seemingly overlapping. I may not know the psychology part, but I do know the “Me” part, and with my vocabulary or metacognitive ability to describe my experiences, I think I have a good shot of conveying what I’m aiming to convey or explain in terms where I may hopefully be at least a little bit understood. I’m a little past AuDHD research now - ended up feeling a let down due to not having many people in my life who understands or is willing to put in the effort TO understand, or I just appear so put together externally that it’s too difficult for others to grasp, I still have questions but I’m waiting on my therapist’s schedule to open up, so I’m running rampant in my research alone. I’m attempting to absorb many resources on topics related to my existence:  neurodivergence, metacognition, self awareness, mis/perception analysis, personality theory, music perception, language mimicry, thought mapping, belonging v alienation, authenticity, agreeableness, and much more. Most recently, I’ve discovered and have been listening to Dr. Jordan Peterson’s lectures and videos, pointed in the direction of other professionals’ videos, so on and so forth; I found that experiences I’m dealing with seems to have been talked about at some point by professionals which is reassuring. There are so many directions this path can take; I want to start with the path that is most efficient in what I’m trying to achieve. It feels as if I am not articulate enough to ask a question in such a way that will give me answer that satisfies me. I’d appreciate feedback, criticisms, similar experiences, explanations, mostly anything to help me not feel alone in the vastness of mind to infinity. (Side note, if you ask me to repeat this paragraph, my explanation of everything, in 10 minutes, you may get a completely different answer, a completely different explanation, possibly even outlook, like a a movie of a world through a different set of eyes.

Experience / thought pattern: Physically, I am drinking coffee or attempting to, standing in my kitchen, listening to information on personality types. I could imagine sitting in the lecture or being in the place of someone analyzed by a professional with similar techniques or strategies used by trained medical professionals who are familiar with whatever this is I’m dealing with, trying to explain that, yes, I had very many common experiences, linear to most girls/women in similar situations in that particular area, or perhaps the country in which I resided at the time, but to the degree of intense depth to which I can explain only with the vocabulary I currently possess, I’m not so sure, I wish I could know. Not to say only I have ever dealt with this phenomenon but I just simply don’t know the percentage of females like myself, experiencing xyz, also not unlike myself to those who do not.
And yet, also I’m imagining the reactions of the people watching; Imagining how I am being perceived, how I am appearing, how people are reacting to my exposed characteristics such as posture, composure, cognitive ability, physical appearance, voice (including how cackle-y, obnoxious, quiet, strange, and snort-filled my laugh may be at times, cracking during memory recall of something painful, sad, exciting, thrilling, confusing, challenging, (mentally trying to mix up these ADJECTIVES to hide personal importance for no good reason), how I am reacted to on my physical or outward appearance and take into consideration the different conclusions people come to when I first enter their sense receptors - pause- I felt a little warm with the windows open, I checked the thermostat and found the temperature was 2 degrees above the temperature we normally set it at (the house we live in does not have an HVAC system). I closed all the windows, let the cat outside, talked and laughed with my daughter, now getting ready to run errands). - I still haven’t moved from my spot in the kitchen, sipping my on black + 1 heaping tsp of sugar coffee, I can’t stop thinking. I need to get into schedule mode. Mentally drifting.. I don’t quite remember the direction this was going without going back.
As the “explainer of the phenomenon” or as one simply experiencing this life as I am coming to know it more deeply, is all this (mentally, philosophically, metacognitively, meta-mood (a/e?)ffects(?), intellectually, psychoanalytically, neurologically) charged experience reactions and analysis notable? Why was I overlooked? How hidden was I and at what age did I blend in so seamlessly to the point others didn’t even question my being or place?
Thanks for reading my info dump and clarification process.

When you’re living month to month, it feels laughable to talk about savings, goals, or emergency funds when your checking account barely makes it to the 30th.

But I recently went down the rabbit hole of figuring out how to plan **even when you're broke**, and wanted to share some stuff that *actually* helped me feel more in control (without the usual “just stop buying coffee” advice):

🔹 **Start with micro-goals.** Not “retire early” just get $100 in savings. Then $250. I started with a $10/week auto-transfer and honestly it felt amazing to just see *something* grow.

🔹 **Bare-bones budgets are more realistic than strict ones.** Focus on rent, food, transit. Then build in *a little joy money* so you don’t burn out.

🔹 **Track spending without guilt.** I used Mint at first. Then I made a spreadsheet. Seeing where your money goes is weirdly empowering.

🔹 **Use windfalls wisely.** I got a small tax refund and put half into my emergency fund and used the rest for a couple things I’d been putting off.

🔹 **You don’t need a perfect plan. You just need a doable one.**

Character Name: Nanakou (ナナコウ)



Etymology: A playful combination of ""Nanaco"" (referencing the Nanaco smart card mascot and service) and ""kou"" (光 meaning 'light', perhaps referencing the bright lights of a convenience store; or 香 meaning 'fragrance', referencing the distinct smells; or simply a common suffix). It evokes the familiar sound of the smart card service.

Age: Appears to be around 10-12 years old, but as a Tsukumogami, her true spiritual age is the cumulative essence absorbed by the uniform and its environment, which is significant enough to grant her sentience (implied to be at least the '100 years' threshold required for many Tsukumogami, though perhaps achieved through accelerated absorption in a modern, high-energy environment).



Gender: Female



Species: Tsukumogami (manifested from a used 7-Eleven uniform), taking the form of a Giraffe Youkai (influenced by the Nanaco mascot).



Physical Appearance:



Nanakou manifests as a small, energetic girl with a perpetually cheerful expression. Her appearance is a blend of human-like features, 7-Eleven uniform elements, and stylized giraffe characteristics influenced by the Nanaco mascot.

Body Type: She has a slight, youthful build, typical of a pre-teen.

Hair: Her hair is a warm, light brown, often styled in messy pigtails or buns, giving her a playful, slightly unprofessional look fitting for a busy store worker. There might be subtle lighter streaks resembling giraffe spots.

Eyes: Bright, wide, and curious eyes, usually depicted in a warm amber or brown color, sparkling with enthusiasm.

Clothing: This is the core of her existence. She wears a stylized, slightly oversized version of a classic Japanese 7-Eleven uniform.

A crisp white shirt, perhaps with slightly too long sleeves.

Over the shirt, a dark grey or black vest with the iconic orange, green, and red 7-Eleven stripes prominently displayed on the lapel or trim. These stripes might glow faintly or subtly shift in color.

A matching grey/black skirt or shorts.

Knee-high socks (perhaps striped like the uniform or subtly patterned like giraffe spots) and simple, sturdy shoes suitable for standing all day.

She might wear a small, slightly askew 7-Eleven cap or a cute headpiece resembling one.

Pinned to her vest is often a name tag that prominently displays ""ナナコウ"" or stylized numbers ""7"" and ""11"".

Giraffe Features: These are subtle and integrated:

Ossicones: Instead of typical animal horns, she has two small, soft ossicones (giraffe horns) poking out from her hair, resembling cute fabric tufts or stylized hair ornaments that match her hair color with darker tips.

Neck Suggestion: While her neck isn't long, she might wear a patterned choker or scarf with a subtle brown and white spotted pattern, suggesting giraffe hide. Her postures can sometimes involve a slight forward tilt or reaching motion that evokes a giraffe's stance without physically altering her neck length.

Tail: A small, tufted tail (matching her hair color) might peek out from under her skirt.

Accessories: She often carries or incorporates elements related to 7-Eleven products or the Nanaco card. This could be a small, stylized Nanaco card charm, a coin purse that resembles the card, or even accessories shaped like onigiri, coffee cups, or churros.

Personality Traits:



Perpetually Cheerful & Energetic: Always seems to be in high spirits, reflecting the bright, busy atmosphere of a convenience store.

Customer Service Focused: Inherently driven to provide ""convenience"" and ""service."" She genuinely wants to help people, offer items, and facilitate transactions (even if the concept of currency or transactions in Gensokyo is different).

Naive & Literal: Due to her unique origin and young appearance, she can be somewhat naive about Gensokyo's customs and residents. She interprets concepts like ""convenience"" or ""getting points"" very literally, which can lead to misunderstandings.

Proud of Her ""Store"": Fiercely proud and protective of her mini 7-Eleven space and the items within it. It's her domain, her purpose.

Eager to Interact: Loves meeting new people and showing them the wonders of ""convenience."" Can be a little pushy in trying to get people to ""try the new rice balls"" or ""get a Nanaco card.""

Surprisingly Powerful (when provoked): While friendly on the surface, disrupting her service, threatening her store, or trying to steal from her triggers her Extra Boss-level power. Her danmaku reflects a sudden, overwhelming manifestation of the store's chaotic energy, focusing on speed, volume, and unexpected patterns, mimicking the sometimes overwhelming choices and transactions in a busy store.

Background:



Nanakou originated from a used 7-Eleven uniform in the Outside World. This wasn't just any uniform; it was one worn by multiple employees over years, accumulating the essence of countless shifts, customer interactions, the sounds of the store (bell chime, scanners, beeps), the smells (coffee, fried food, cleaning supplies), and perhaps most importantly, the pervasive visual and symbolic presence of the Nanaco smart card system and its mascot.

This constant absorption of structured, yet chaotic, energy from a uniquely convenient and modern environment, coupled with the distinct, friendly imagery of the Nanaco giraffe, led the uniform to gain sentience, not just as a generic cloth tsukumogami, but specifically as a spirit embodying the identity of a 7-Eleven, shaped by its most prominent symbol (the giraffe mascot).

Through means unknown (perhaps a boundary phenomenon occurring near a particularly high-traffic or energetically unique 7-Eleven, or the sheer accumulation of Outside World essence creating a weak point), Nanakou and a pocket-dimension version of her store were pulled into Gensokyo.

She manifested within her mini 7-Eleven, which appeared seemingly overnight somewhere relatively quiet but accessible in Gensokyo (perhaps near the Human Village, or a less-trodden path in the forest, constantly relocating slightly due to spatial instability).

Her existence is now dedicated to running her ""store"" in Gensokyo, offering its strange, Outside World goods and services to whoever happens upon it, utterly convinced that everyone needs ""convenience"" and ""points."" This often leads to confusion, curiosity, and sometimes conflict with Gensokyo residents who don't understand her nature or purpose.

Other Relevant Information:



The Mini 7-Eleven: Nanakou's home and domain is a spatially distorted, pocket-dimension structure that outwardly resembles a small, brightly lit 7-Eleven building. Inside, it is surprisingly spacious, packed floor-to-ceiling with an impossible variety of genuine 7-Eleven products from the Outside World – chilled drinks, snacks, instant noodles, konbini meals (onigiri, sandos), fried chicken, coffee machines, stationery, even some more obscure goods. These items appear to be constantly restocked through her inherent ability linked to the store's essence. The store interior is always clean and well-maintained, reflecting her pride.

Powers: Nanakou's abilities stem from her connection to the 7-Eleven environment, the Nanaco service, and her tsukumogami nature.

Convenience Manifestation: She can conjure objects found in her store, warp small distances (short 'dashes' like a quick errand run), or manipulate minor aspects of immediate reality to be more ""convenient"" or, in danmaku combat, inconvenient for the opponent.

Item Energy: Her danmaku often takes the visual form of various store items (rice balls, coffee splashes, slurpee ice, candy) or abstract representations of store energy (scanning beams, receipt paper streams, cash register beeps, points multipliers).

Nanaco System Manipulation: She can generate and control energy pulses resembling the beep and light flash of a Nanaco card transaction, create forcefields or patterns based on the card's appearance or the number of points, and mimic digital processing/scanning effects.

Numbered Patterns: Strong affinity for the numbers 7 and 11, incorporating them heavily into her danmaku formations and spell card themes.

Boundary Residue: Her mini-store exists partially outside of Gensokyo's reality, giving her some minor control over localized spatial distortion within her domain, making dodging unpredictable.

Gameplay Mechanics (Extra Boss-like): Nanakou's fight would be characterized by high-speed, complex patterns that combine different visual themes (items, numbers, digital effects) and often change rapidly, reflecting the non-stop nature of a busy convenience store. Her patterns would feel simultaneously helpful (offering 'paths' or 'items') and overwhelmingly inconvenient.



Shot Types (4):



Snack Scatter (スナックスキャッター): Spreads of small, fast projectiles resembling various minor candies or rice crackers. Varies in density and direction.

Slurpee Stream (スラーピーストリーム): A concentrated, piercing laser or stream of icy-looking, slightly chaotic projectiles originating from her hand or an item conjured beside her. Can home or sweep.

Nanaco Beep (nanacoビープ音): Rapid-fire waves of circular or square energy bullets accompanied by distinct sound effects, often appearing horizontally or vertically like scanning lines.

Fresh Brew Spray (フレッシュ・ブリュー・スプレー): A wide fan of larger, slower projectiles (like coffee splashes) that leave behind smaller, faster trails of steam or heat energy.

Spell Cards (10):



Convenience Sign ""Open 24/7 Service"" (便利符 「年中無休のサービス」): A dense, continuous barrage of pulsing or blinking light-based bullets, filling the screen and forcing the player to constantly weave through narrow gaps, reflecting the store's unending availability.

Konbini Grub ""Rice Ball Cyclone"" (コンビニグラブ 「おにぎりサイクロン」): Large, slow-moving circular orbits or spirals of onigiri-shaped bullets that gradually shrink their safe zones or release secondary bullet types.

Item Recommendation ""Weekly Special Barrage"" (おすすめアイテム 「ウィークリー・スペシャル・バレージ」): Nanakou rapidly throws projectiles resembling various popular 7-Eleven items (fried chicken, churros, instant cup patterns) in semi-random or slightly homing bursts.

Digital Transaction ""Point Accumulation Beam"" (デジタル取引 「ポイント蓄積ビーム」): Nanakou charges energy, creating a visual effect of numbers or points swirling around before firing a powerful, wide beam of Nanaco energy that tracks the player slowly.

Giraffe Pace ""Long-Strided Danmaku"": Patterns that emphasize vertical movement or create tall walls of bullets with specific vertical safe points, forcing players to dodge upwards or downwards, mimicking a giraffe's movement.

Lucky Number ""Seven Rings of Fortune"" (ラッキーナンバー 「7つの幸運の輪」): Nanakou creates multiple rings of bullets, each containing exactly 7 projectiles, which rotate and expand or contract.

Late Night Rush ""Midnight Snack Stampede"" (深夜ラッシュ 「ミッドナイト・スナック・スタンピード」): Extremely fast, thin lines or small clusters of bullets that appear with little warning, overwhelming the player like a sudden influx of customers.

Boundary Store ""Anytime, Anywhere Warp"" (バウンダリーストア 「いつでもどこでもワープ」): Bullet patterns that briefly disappear and reappear elsewhere on the screen, or projectiles that enter from unexpected angles near the screen edges, highlighting the spatial anomaly of her store.

Store Emblem ""Triple Stripe Formation"" (店舗エンブレム 「トリプル・ストライプ・フォーメーション」): Powerful, wide beams or wave patterns of danmaku specifically colored red, green, and orange, moving in coordinated or overlapping patterns.

Ultimate Convenience ""Thank You For Shopping! Please Come Again!"" (究極の利便性 「お買い物ありがとうございました！また来てください!」): A final, climactic spell card that combines elements from previous attacks – item-shaped bullets mixed with Nanaco energy waves, dense numerical patterns (7s and 11s), and perhaps a final, extremely fast, screen-filling pattern resembling scanning lines or receipt paper streams. Despite the intensity, Nanakou maintains a cheerful expression throughout.

Nanakou's presence in Gensokyo provides a unique point of intersection for the magical and mundane (Outside World) elements, embodying the familiar yet alien concept of modern convenience in a realm steeped in tradition and natural magic. Her fights are a test of adaptability and pattern recognition amidst cheerful chaos, fitting for an Extra Boss who is both a friendly face and an embodiment of overwhelming, unexpected forces.",1,1749148675.0,u_InstanceStraight2344,0,1.0,False

We went into the hospital for a planned induction and she ended up getting a C-section based on the doctor's recommendation.

I remember feeling helpless and useless while my wife was in pain from contractions. They had to redo the epidural hours after starting due to the pain she was feeling, only to end up getting a C-section anyway. And once that decision was made, everything happened so fast. I just wanted my wife and baby boy to be safe.

I was with my wife when we heard his first cry, and I've never felt those wave of emotions before. I looked at my son, and started crying from the overwhelming emotions I felt in that moment. I looked at my wife and she was crying with me. We touched our heads and cried tears of joy together.

In the days since, we've been learning how to adjust and get sleep in when we can. But I cannot articulate how it feels to hold him and feel his warmth as he naps on my chest.

It's indescribable, and I understand now. Yes, it's tough and can be difficult to understand his needs, but when I'm staring at his little face as he stares back at me, all of that difficulty is worth it.

I love this little guy, and I'm so excited to be his dad. I get it. I understand what I've heard others say, and it wasn't until now that it clicked. The other day I was sitting with him and singing Bob Marley's ""Is this love"" to him, and I cried while holding him. 

I'm so happy to be a dad. Cheers to all you dads! 🥂

Their poor children.,"When she says Devin gave her crap over serving sizes with her (expensive) coffee creamer. 🙄 throw the whole husband away. The measuring out of serving sizes is literally what I did in the depths of my ED. Unless you’re preparing for a body building competition or something, that’s not normal behavior. 

Obviously an excess of sugar is a problem but Jan is almost certainly not going to develop any serious health issues by eyeing her low sugar coffee creamer instead of measuring it out or by having two gluten free dairy free fun free cookies instead of one. 

Their children are going to grow up with such a complex about food. Giving him a “low sugar” BIRTHDAY CAKE is a perfect example. What are they going to do when their kids inevitably beg them for a pop tart? Is that going to be a hard no? Will they be shamed?

Anything to do with coordination, such as marching, I could not do.., unable to follow simple instructions, always struggling to do tasks that everyone do... I also realised I always was not interested in anything in life, always a face and body posture with no soul, lifeless, people always ask me why I am sad, when I'm just not and dont know how to explain. I also had zero attention span, always interrupt people when talking, could not eye contact people, always anxious.. was a laughing meme for 2 years... I was also always very slow and no energy and motivation to do anything... I'm last in everything, and just somehow used my will power to get through military service... one thing that I was hooked to and somewhat helped me was taking coffee everyday, but it always caused brain fog and always jittery. So many points at my life, just felt like I'm existing and what's the point of living...

After the 2 years, I slowly tried to get rid of all these. Things I tried.
- quiting caffeine, anxiety and brainfog was slightly gone, but always still no energy, and depressed and still the same. 

- tried to change my diet, lost nearly 10kg, as I thought is due to low insulin resistance and overweight, focused on high protein meals, with lesser carbs and avoided any sweet stuff, brain fog slightly better but overall I did not feel any difference, felt even more weak due to lesser carbohydrates..

-did a blood test, found out I had vitamin D deficieny, started to take vitamin D in the morning and magnesium before sleep, slight improvements as sleep quality was insane. But still the same mostly..

- when to a upper cervical chiropractor as I always had a forward neck, bad posture, found out that I did have a slight misalignnent from the x ray results,underwent treatment,but still not much difference...

and finally... one of the days my colleague at workplace was explaining his ADHD condition and how the medication was really helping him. And it sort of resonated to me a little... so i decided to go to a psychiatrist..

and BOOM! The psychiatrist did not even do any test, I explained everything and she instantly knew is a combination of INATTENTIVE and IMPULSIVE ADHD. She gave some meds to try and ever since my life has entirely changed.. right now I take 4pmg(last 12hrs,long acting) of vyvanse whenever I have work or have a day full of activities lined up, either that or I take 10-15mg(last 2-3hrs, shirt acting) of ritalin when I just need to go gym..

I'm really so happy ever since, I aced a interview and got a really better job, I'm easily making conversations with anyone, people in public even approach me and start talking to me, more people smile and say hi to me..,  I am so interested in whatever I do and so focused, I enjoy every single minute of life when I'm on the medication. One more thing i practiced which I do not know if helped is, semen retention and quitting porn, masturbation, lusting over women, and looking at women genuinely and lowering my gaze. I also become more spiritual and religious, trying to become more closer to god as it gave me a purpose in life.

However whenever I'm not on the medication, I go back to my old self, foggy brain, slow, no feels to anything, just zoning out, zero energy. So I'm still in a exploring phase of when to use the medication as if timed wrongly can affect sleep, as well as I'm trying my best not to become too dependent on it.

Whoever is going through bbrainfog, fatigue, anxiety, no interesting in anything in life, please seriously give a visit to the psychiatrist, do not see the money and take it as a investment to your health, because if it works, life will become from zero to 100!",3,1749148121.0,BrainFog,2,0.67,False
1l46p2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l46p2p/cant_tell_if_hes_into_me_too_help/,Can’t tell if he’s into me too- help?,"
   Hey y’all- need assistance in determining whether the guy(36m) I’ve(31f) been crushing on is into me as well or not. My best friend thinks hes interested as well(from what shes heard from me) but he’s kind of hard to read in general and I just don’t wanna try to make any moves without feeling confident the feeling could be mutual, mainly because we work together. 
   He’s a very quiet, shy-seeming, stoic type(until you get close enough, then he can be a giggly goober at times) but his demeanor/face can make him extra hard to read(admitted he has been working on his poker face since he was young and has definitely perfected that shit). 
Here are some of the things that make me think maybe he’s into it too though (please check me if this is just friendly and I’m just being delulu lol):
* in the 9ish months I’ve worked with him, weve gotten very friendly- to the extent that 2 other coworkers have separately told me that they’ve never seen dude talk/be so engaged/laugh as much as he does with me and that he and I “just seem to click and really get eachother/work naturally well together”. 
* We make each other laugh a lot(like not just a ha-ha, but like extended crack ups)
* have some obscure music/shows/interests/podcasts in common 
* we’ve socialized outside of work a few  times(went to a movie just us; went to a small local music show at a bar in his neighborhood-my cousin eventually joined us like half way through; and another movie we saw with his sister as well). 
* I definitely make sure I look nice when we work together, and I feel like I catch him looking at me a lot-like a majority of the time I look over at him- he’s either already looking at me(or at least in my direction) or he looks at me  almost immediately after I look over
* recently, I feel like hes been finding more things to chat with me about and will come to all the way across the store to talk with me sometimes. He’s also way more comfortable getting physically close to me(he usually keeps his personal space from most people if he can). Recently, he’s had no problem getting really close behind/to the side of me when putting tickets up, and sometimes when he’s grabbing a ticket from me, he’ll brush or touch my hand a little(which could be an accident but can also be fairly easily avoided too).
* He also remembers the stuff I tell him about my personal life and notes my suggestions-like he’s checked in about projects I’ve told him I’m working onand has added movies ive suggested to his watchlists, stuff like that. 
* He occasionally comes in on his days off when I’m working and almost always around the time my shift starts. Usually there’s some sort of reason(getting something off work desktop, dropping something off, just to get a coffee, etc.) but sometimes I feel like it’s stuff that could’ve waited til his next shift.. 
* He watches all my insta stories. Which I feel silly noting but I also feel like that’s kinda significant these days, right?
* Something small I’ve noticed too is despite his stoic nature, he does get smiley when I’m proud of myself or excited about something- for example: I created a new retail product for us and have put all the work into it myself. It’s been very successful so far and whenever I check in on it and see it doing well, I get all excited and (in a half joking way)give myself my flowers for it- and I’ve noticed he’s usually smiling or fighting a smile when I geek out about it. 
   So like, all of that makes me feel like he could be into it too, but for some reason still feel unsure…I get the sense hes not used to being pursued by lots of girls and not sure if hes even realizing that ive been looking cute for him/posting so he’ll see it/looking at him all the time too/finding ways to talk/be close to him, etc. but like.. I am lol. 
   Feeling hella stuck and not sure where to go from here- so if y’all have insight or can at least tell me if it’s lookin good or bad, I’d greatly appreciate some input…

And I’ve never seen an order delivered like the one today. 

It was 32 items total. Some of the items were same so I tipped $24 for the items and then added $6 as the store is 3.1 miles away for a total of a $30 tip. We are also in Cali and the drivers get prop 22. It took them 1.5 hours from accepting to delivery (they probably had multiple orders). But I know just from my order they are getting $30 in prop 22 plus milage plus my $30 tip. And whatever else the other orders tipped. 


Nearly everything was ruined. Holes poked in the top of my yogurts, bananas opened at the top, tomatoes squished, steel wool and soap just missing. Oatmeal packets opened…. Like not the box but the packets inside the box… they never spoke to me about replacements literally just replaced my protein bars with ones I’m allergic to in a different stand not close to the same flavor. Replaced my ground beef with watermelon? Did the replacements on the system 2 seconds before they checked out so I couldn’t approve or deny them. Then packed everything in chaos leaving eggs broken on top of my asparagus and cabbage which weren’t in veggie bags… left at the curb not my door of course.

I get why so many customers are frustrated all the time when there are drivers out there doing this… if you dislike shopping don’t take those orders. If you truly hate this job why even bother? Your rating will eventually get so low to even work… 

I personally love shopping orders, and try my hardest to make sure people are getting food they’ll eat and enjoy. I even ask them like don’t want the fruit ripe today or in a few days type stuff.

1l46jmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1l46jmn/i_quite_litterally_cant_take_it_with_lifes/,I quite litterally can't take it with life's injustice (Will feud),"Sigh\* where do i even start everyone.

So let me open up by being straight forward, i am from a family of people that from my fathers side i've been constantly and continuous exploited since i was young. I had cut all ties near the end of jr high school with them since we had some conflict with our father never being attentive and not paying child support.

I could count, the amount of cruel, inhumane things ive went through, and this post still wouldn't be enough to list half of them, so ill be moving to the main topic.

After years of not talking to them, i was growing kind of sad, cause i did have a few good ties with that side of the family, particularly my grandma and uncle, 10 years is a long time to be mad, and they didnt deserve me not paying them any visit or a single phone call, albeit with my uncle we did have a once or twice calls in the years with him scolding me for not calling while he was drunk, he never once insulted me, he trully cared but i was too scared to reconnect at the time.

So i pick up the phone, and there they are, i reconnect i meet some of the good parts of the family, and some of the... bad parts of the family again, like my father who has now grown senile from his 60's due to him abusing medicine to claim he can't work for more money (he was deep in debt fo years), years of abusing medicine not intended for him left a dent to his cognition... it was a sad thing to see as is.

But within the same month i reconnected with my family, my uncle died, my own cousin called crying for help cause he couldnt do something and i had to litterally run as i was there to perform CPR to my uncle, he was dead for some time when i arrived according to the emergency responders..  
I was in shock, i kept asking my aunt and cousin, why they didnt call a single ambulance and they kept responding ""why should we?"" as if its a hard question to answer with a dead person on your couch...

Then i was litterally picked up the same day in a car, to go prepare for his funeral within the same day, i had to carry his coffin and hear from people how proud they are.

Not only was i devastated, and tried to console my poor grandma who now grew depressed and she had her grandkid (my cousin) kept calling her senile in her face, or my aunt who keeps enabling her kid at near 40 years old (this guy wont even make a coffee on his own, he just wakes up his mommy to make him coffee even if she hasnt slept all night).

But this became quickly more tangled, when they dragged me along for the funeral, i was promised they would return me home to attend my university classes (i know my uncle just died, and i was devastated, but i really need to finish with university + im a working man so getting this kind of time off.. was just not in good order for me trying to get a grasp of my life).

Sunday comes and they told me they will return me on wednesday, im like huh? im really sorry, im trully sorry but why did you tell me to get in the car and you will return me tomorrow? im not mad you can't, im MAD you weren't honest.

""Whats to worry"" im told, ""arent you sad and need time to yourself?"", YES away from you guys, to my own house, leaving my heart the space i need to trully mourn my loss, not to babysit you guys...

But i can't say that now can i? No, i was nice and said ill buy my own bus fare and told them goodbye returning after a brief attempt of negotiation from them to keep me there cause id be a bad person if i leave.

So, months pass, summer reaches and i receive a phone call ""Grandma is sick and she is dying, come say your goodbyes"", i shit you not when i say i was crying and dashing to the point my kneecaps were hurting to manage and save her, i reach there and she has a fever and is delirious, the room devoid of any open windows or fans, i use my quick thinking with some cold towels and call an ambulance, i bring a fan they had stored somewhere and i try to keep putting towels on her forehead and armpits trying to keep her well.

We reach the hospital, and the doctors thanked me for my quick thinking, she had a UTI and due to her pre-existing heart conditions it lead to this spiralling quick out of control.

I had a fight with my aunt and cousin that day, WHY not call an ambulance, WHY act like its her funeral right in front of her, WHY worsen the condition.. ""She isnt well"" ""she will die soon anyway you dont understand""..

I left crying that day after staying to the best of my abilities as long as i could in the hospital.

Im called a couple weeks later to learn my grandma died (in the hospital she was fine and the doctor said the condition is critical, but if monitored properly and taken care of she is expected to make full recovery).

I was told to get in the car and go to the funeral the very same day, but honestly i was exhausted, i wanted to cry and i ignored them, i stayed home crying all day.

.. Now we reach the point where dear readers id like your real attention.

Before she died, before she got sick, a couple weeks after my uncle died, i was called there so she can announce her will.

She announced she wants to make amends to me and my sister (i could keep going, but lets say my grandma did her fair share of underhanded stuff to both of us, but mostly me..), and that she will be leaving us a fair fortune and so on.

I didn't care at the time, and honestly i still \*don't\* care for the fortune itself.

But after she died, i was told the will lawyer should contact us once she dies to explain the process.

I asked my cousin for the phone number so i can ask how much to save up so i can be sure i can afford to pay him when the time came, instead i was faced with yelling, he called me the circus of the village, saying i should be ashamed of myself for not going to her funeral, for not paying a single dime, for not really caring.

He said im trying to steal his fortune, he said if he doesnt sign im not seeing a single dime and thats how grandma left stuff (which already sounds unusual).

I said i understand you upset, but can i please have the phone number? i only care to know how much to save up, i heard its about 50 to 80 euros but i need to verify as im making minimum wage...

He said (albeit im paraphrasing to simplify) to go fuck myself and closed the phone to my face...

Weeks pass, months..  
I receive a phone call ""time to pay 250 each for the lawyer so he can open up the will"", i asked who is the  lawyer.. no response again.

For context i make about 700 a month minus rent im left at 300, you can imagine with other bills as well that kind of money hits like a brick.

""a lawyer? didnt we have a will lawyer, they are typically the ones that get in contact and ask you to come"" (i know this cause in the same year my other side grandma also died.. so i faced this first hand).

""Doesn't matter, come to our house, pay and we will go"".

Once i said im bringing more people into this conversation (my mother in particular) they cut all contacts.

So now im stuck with lawyers of my own, trying to chase down a venue to get to the truth, and today i receive a phone call.. ""there is no legal ground that we can pursue unless we can find that lawyer they mentioned... i am afraid either you contact them and try to get the name or they won them all""..

My girlfriend? Constantly telling me to drop this entire facade, its not worth the pain she says, she sees me writhe in stress, and she also hurts, but she doesn't understand the sheer rage and depression i have from feeling so.. so betrayed and stolen from...

This entire story, is the surface of the mountain of abuse, and im constantly trying to keep myself together.. but its getting so hard...

**The brutal honest results:**

- Day 1-7: Felt like a creative genius
- Day 8-18: Wanted to delete everything and become an accountant
- Day 19-30: Found my groove (finally)

**What actually worked:**

- Behind-the-scenes studio clips got 3x more engagement than polished lyric videos
- 6am PST posts hit Europe perfectly, 6pm caught US after work scroll
- Typography over moody city shots somehow matched the song’s vibe better than expected

**Epic fails:**

- Spent 4 hours on an animated visualizer that got 12 views
- Posted the same sunset photo with different filters (desperate times…)
- Accidentally posted a meme about coffee instead of song content on day 23

**Unexpected discovery:** The visual style that performed best was raw iPhone footage of me actually living the “one life” message - walking at sunrise, late night writing sessions, random moments of clarity.

[[Explore Top Rated brio water dispenser reviews on Amazon.]](https://site.vrmemes.com/clearance-products/?kw=brio water dispenser reviews)

## Key Features Analysis

The Brio water dispenser range boasts several noteworthy features that enhance convenience and provide a superior hydration experience.

**Tri-Temperature Dispensing:**
The Ability to dispense hot, cold, and room-temperature water is a hallmark of Brio dispensers. this eliminates the need for separate appliances like kettles and water coolers, streamlining your kitchen or office space. The cold water temperature typically ranges from 37-50°F, while the hot water reaches 180-200°F, ideal for making tea, coffee, or instant soups. Room temperature water provides a refreshing alternative to both extremes.

**Self-Cleaning Technology:**
Many Brio models feature a self-cleaning function that utilizes ozone to sanitize the water tank and prevent microbial growth. This automated process eliminates the need for manual cleaning, saving time and ensuring the purity of your water. The self-cleaning cycle usually runs automatically or can be initiated manually based on your preferences.

**Child Safety Lock:**
Brio dispensers often include a child safety lock on the hot water dispenser. This crucial safety feature prevents accidental burns and ensures the safety of children in the household. The lock typically requires a simple press-and-hold action to activate the hot water dispensing mechanism.

**High-Capacity Water tanks:**

Most brio water dispensers feature large-capacity water tanks, minimizing the frequency of refills. The cold water tank usually holds around 1-1.5 gallons, while the hot water tank holds around 0.5-1 gallon. These ample capacities cater to households and offices with varying water consumption needs.

**Filter Compatibility:**
Brio dispensers are designed to be compatible with a variety of water filtration systems, including both bottleless and bottled options. Models supporting bottleless setups often include built-in filtration systems that utilize activated carbon or multi-stage filters to effectively remove impurities, chlorine, and odors from tap water. Bottle-fed models cater to users who prefer to use pre-filtered water from bottled sources.

The following are some key features found in Brio Water Dispensers:

*   Tri-temperature dispensing (hot,cold,room temperature)
*   Self-cleaning technology
*   Child safety lock
*   High-capacity water tanks
*   Filter compatibility

## Core Benefits

Brio water dispensers offer several compelling benefits that make them a worthwhile addition to any home or office.**Enhanced Hydration Convenience:** With instant access to hot,cold,and room-temperature water,Brio dispensers encourage more frequent hydration throughout the day. This eliminates the inconvenience of waiting for water to boil or cool down,making it easier to maintain a healthy hydration routine.

**Improved Water Quality:** Brio dispensers with built-in filtration systems provide access to cleaner and better-tasting water. These filters effectively remove impurities, chlorine, and odors, resulting in a more refreshing and enjoyable drinking experience.This is especially beneficial for those concerned about the quality of their tap water.

**Reduced Environmental Impact:** Switching to a Brio water dispenser can significantly reduce your reliance on single-use plastic water bottles. By using refillable bottles or connecting the dispenser to a water line with built-in filtration, you can actively contribute to reducing plastic waste and promoting a more sustainable lifestyle.

**Cost Savings:** Over time, a Brio water dispenser can save you money compared to constantly purchasing bottled water or using a kettle and separate water cooler. The initial investment is offset by the long-term savings on water bottles and electricity.

**Convenient and Space-Saving Design:** Brio water dispensers are designed to be compact and user-amiable, fitting seamlessly into various spaces. They eliminate the clutter of multiple appliances, such as kettles and water coolers, consolidating your hydration needs into a single, efficient unit.

## FAQs Section

**How often should I clean my Brio water dispenser?**
The frequency of cleaning depends on the model and usage. Though, a general proposal is to wipe down the exterior weekly and deep clean the water tanks every 3-6 months. Models with self-cleaning features require less frequent deep cleaning.

**What type of water can I use in a Brio water dispenser?**
You can use tap water, distilled water, or spring water in a Brio water dispenser, provided that the model is compatible with your chosen water source. For tap water, it is recommended to use a dispenser with a built-in filtration system to remove impurities.**Does the Brio water dispenser require any special installation?**
Installation requirements vary depending on the model. Bottle-fed models typically require minimal setup,involving simply placing a water bottle onto the dispenser. Bottleless models may require connecting to a water line, which may necessitate professional installation.

**What is the lifespan of a Brio water dispenser?**
With proper maintenance, a Brio water dispenser can last for several years.The average lifespan is around 5-7 years, but this can vary depending on usage patterns and the quality of the water used.

## Buying recommendations & Conclusion

When selecting a Brio water dispenser, consider factors such as your budget, water consumption needs, and desired features. Models with self-cleaning and filtration systems offer enhanced convenience and water quality, but may come at a higher price.

Evaluate the space available in your kitchen or office to determine the appropriate size and style of the dispenser. Bottle-fed models are more portable, while bottleless models offer a continuous supply of water.

Brio water dispensers offer a compelling combination of convenience, water quality, and safety features, making them a worthwhile investment for individuals and businesses seeking a reliable source of clean and refreshing water. While not without minor cost considerations, its strengths in automatic sanitization and versatile temperature control make it a solid water dispensing option.

1l46dh3,https://v.redd.it/0mk9xdzwg55f1,it’s giving anemic chihuahua,"Ok maybe the title is a little harsh, but she shared this clip of Wicked promotion and she’s straining SOOO hard to make her traps disappear and make her neck look as long and snatched as possible that she’s quite literally trembling and wobbling, breathing almost entirely with her upper chest and neck flexors (which can cause lots of issues long term). 

You can even hear the tension in that squeaky, breathy, baby voice. She’s yanking her shoulder blades back so hard her elbows can’t even rest straight down at her sides. She looks tense in photos and even more tense on video.

I think the lack of food means she’s freezing and no longer has the stamina to hold poses for a long period of time. Stimulants/black coffee will amplify shake and fidgeting too. Idk how someone can be on camera for their career this long and not know this reads as tense, nervous, and unpolished. Cynthia looks poised and grounded in comparison.

Her team is failing her in so many ways. She looks like she needs some deep diaphragmatic breaths and a jacket!",35,1749147311.0,ArianaGrandeSnark,17,0.98,False

Here's some advice,"We all know that every day has its own unique chances and gifts, but honestly, we usually don’t notice them in the rush of daily life. Today I wanna talk about how to actually enjoy every day, find inspiration in regular stuff, and give yourself little moments of happiness. This isn’t just some nice advice, it’s actually a big part of our mental and emotional well-being.

Let’s start with a simple question: what does joy mean to you? For some people, it’s that moment when the morning sun comes through the curtains, for others it’s kids laughing or the smell of fresh coffee. Joy is a feeling that comes from inside and can be triggered by the most ordinary things. A lot of times we’re looking for something amazing or huge, but we forget that happiness can be in the tiniest details.

First thing to remember: practice mindfulness. Mindfulness helps us focus on the present, not

on worries about the future or regrets about the past. Try to make time every day to just be. Maybe it’s a morning ritual where you enjoy a cup of tea and really taste every sip. Or maybe it’s an evening walk where you listen to the sounds around you and breathe in the fresh air. Try to notice the details: colors, sounds, feelings. Most of the time, real happiness is hiding in those moments.

Next step — let yourself dream and set goals. Pay attention to what inspires you and makes you happy. Maybe you wanna learn something new or go on a trip. Make a list of small and big wishes and go for them. Every step towards your dream will bring you joy and satisfaction, turning boring days into a cool adventure.

Talking with people close to you is another big part of  joy. Share your feelings, celebrate each other’s wins, and support each other when things are tough. Make your own traditions, spend time together — it makes your bonds stronger and adds more color to everyday life.

And don’t forget to take care of  yourself. Find time for your hobbies, do what you love, whether it’s reading, drawing, or sports. Pay attention to your mental and physical health. Remember, joy starts with you — with how you treat yourself and your life.

There’s always something in every day that can make you smile. Open your heart to those moments, learn to notice and appreciate them. Joy isn’t a final goal, it’s a way of living.  Let every new day be another chance for happiness. I really believe, together with you, that all of us can learn to enjoy life and fill it with light and good vibes.

Share in the comments what brings you joy! Let’s make a list together of things that make you happy!!",2,1749147297.0,ThoughtfulSpace,0,1.0,False

1l46bvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l46bvl/i_really_cant_take_any_more/,i really can't take any more.,"Yesterday I had a second panic attack. The first one was a couple months ago.

I’m so tired of living in fear. Fear of losing my job, my scholarship, my house, my friends, the love of my life. Everything is leaving in silence, or leaving with screaming, pain and hurt.

It’s not enough to just feel the fear. He has to manifest real pain now.

I had a fight with my ex-girlfriend. She asked to meet in her house Sunday, and we kissed and gave each other oral for a short while. She asked to stop, and I stopped. The rest of the night went smoothly. We watched a show with her laying on top of me, we shared food, and kissed and hugged goodbye. Then after I left and everything seemed like it was going to work out, she went radio silent for the week. I asked why yesterday. She said I was insistent on continuing after she stopped giving me oral. I didn’t insist on anything, I simply asked why she stopped. She said it was because her dog was at the house, and was looking at us. I simply said we did these things before with the dog at the house, and she said i was insisting because of that. I didn’t ask for her to continue, shoved my penis at her or anything. I simply pulled my pants up and asked the question. While we talked and she said this yesterday, I had a complete meltdown over the phone. I was already having a bronchitis crise, and when it became harder to breathe and my chest tightened, I knew another attack was coming. I called an uber to the ER.

She called once again, and stomped more on me. Earlier the day through text and before our last call, when she ignored me during the week, I said I was hurt because I felt used. For the last couple months, she ignored my messages and only looked for me when she felt like it. Usually late at night. She was making me feel the same way at the beginning of the week, and it made me feel like she was alone at home on a sunday night and only needed me to make her company and give her attention. On Saturday dawn, she drunk dialed me at 3am, said she wanted to see me.

I stayed at the ER until 4am. I said to my family that i was sleeping at a friend's house.

The doctor gave me xanax and a recipe for future attacks. I went to the drugstore and bought muscle relaxants too. Asked for the uber to left me at a lookout that has on my neighbour. The same one i went to when i was a teenager. I can see the entire place where I grew up. It’s beautiful. It’s easy to remember simpler times. I bought a cheap bottle of vodka on uber eats to an address close to the spot. I picked up and spent the night sitting on a rock looking at the place i grew up, and looking at my life. I was very much ready to chug everything. I only wanted the pain to stop.

I put my wallet at the side of the rock i was sitting. The thought of someone finding my body rotting on top of a rock three days later, hold me back for a while. Even in death i felt exposed. I hate myself and my body, but someone seeing me worse than i already am made me ponder for an hour.

But the only thing that stopped me was my mom and my sister. I can’t do this to them. I am almost sure that if i do something like this, they will follow after me. And it will be much worse for them. I'd rather carry the pain of the world than to inflict this kind of pain to them.

I listened to music like it was gray noise for the entire night. When my headphones ran out of battery, my phone speaker sang them like a faint radio. The wind was louder.

I left the bottle sealed beside the rock. Maybe it will make another teenager that hangs in this spot feel like it hit the jackpot. Make good memories like the one i had in this place.

i stayed at the spot until 7am. Called a uber to work, without sleeping.

I am sitting numb at my desk since. it’s 11:00 am now. I don’t feel hunger, thirst or need to sleep.

Drank 4 cups of coffee and chain smoke 5 cigarettes. I have so much to do, but i feel so done with everything. I just need to stop existing.",3,1749147207.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

The second thing is when I first started playing the first time, and I was just exploring Prague, I remember breaking into some kind of restaurant/bar/coffee house, which was unique for being stand alone (maybe near the water?), had outside seating, a basement and an upstairs with a deck. This was no where to be found this time, and I even explored all of Prague looking for it.",9,1749147133.0,Deusex,13,0.74,False
