You say you want to know everything about me—&#10;
not just my name &#10;
or why I don’t drink coffee, &#10;
but the choreography of my hands when I’m nervous, &#10;
the way my voice flutters &#10;
when I talk about something I used to love. &#10;


You want to see how I tilt my head &#10;
when I’m thinking, &#10;
how my eyes trace silence &#10;
like a sentence I never finish. &#10;


You want to meet the girl I used to be—&#10;
awkward and too soft, &#10;
sitting in the back of the classroom, &#10;
drawing flowers in the margins of math worksheets. &#10;


You want to know the sound of my laugh &#10;
before I learned to hide it, &#10;
the crush I had on a boy who never looked back, &#10;
the way I felt invincible &#10;
and invisible all at once. &#10;


You want my opinions—&#10;
not the polished ones I offer to the world, &#10;
but the ones I keep in my chest, &#10;
raw and wrinkled, &#10;
formed at midnight, &#10;
whispered into pillows, unsaid. &#10;


You want my past like a library, &#10;
my thoughts like confession, &#10;
and my heart like an open book &#10;
you’re willing to read &#10;
without skipping any pages. &#10;


And it should be a miracle &#10;
to be seen like this. &#10;
But it aches. &#10;


Because this is not a beginning. &#10;
This is not a love &#10;
that can bloom in the light. &#10;


You will not trace your finger &#10;
down the length of my spine. &#10;
You will not memorize the slope of my back &#10;
as I walk away. &#10;
You will not call me yours—&#10;
not even in secret. &#10;


So instead, &#10;
you know me in the quietest way: &#10;
through imagined lives and almosts, &#10;
through words offered like flowers &#10;
that will never be picked, &#10;
through a love not less real &#10;
because it cannot be lived. &#10;


To be known by you like this—&#10;
completely, &#10;
exquisitely, &#10;
impossibly—&#10;
is the sweetest grief &#10;
I have ever tasted. &#10;

https://preview.redd.it/s0lz5b3o1vmf1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=121446034a8b24e9c3b145fcd286214cade185f8

Here’s my unpopular opinion: you should only tell your deepest secrets to strangers you’ll never meet again.

When you confide in family members, friends, or associates, you give them crucial insights that can one day be leveraged against you. Strangers don’t hang around or snoop — they’ll be gone within minutes, hours, or at worst, days. They won’t waste energy exposing you, especially if your conversation happened at an airport, coffee shop, bar or some anonymous online forum.

If there’s ever a chance encounter after you’ve shared your darkest fears or ugliest flaws, they’ll probably question their own memory: “Is that the person I spoke to a while back?” Even those with photographic memories who fully recognize you will be too busy with their own lives and problems to care or interact again.

Let’s say by some improbable chance they did share your information with someone you know. The people in your circle wouldn’t believe a random person claiming you told them vital details. They wouldn’t be able to fathom why you’d tell intimate secrets to a stranger. If they do believe it and grasp onto whatever negative information they heard, be thankful — a so-called “friend” who wants to believe the worst about you is simply exposing their true nature. That’s a rare gift of confirmation, solidifying a glimpse beyond their fake persona to know exactly where you stand in your relationship.

The information won’t be credible anyway. Anyone told would ask, “Where did you hear that?” The answer: “He told some person at a bar, and they told me.” Who would believe that nonsense? An easy strategy is to brush off the accusation as pure hearsay — the perfect defense keeping the main point intact that strangers in unfamiliar areas are the best people to divulge your deepest and darkest secrets, if you need someone to talk to.

**Finding the Right Strangers**

https://preview.redd.it/1j7eezss1vmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae1508186bd32d459c3c3cde9a362c7e7cf2e5aa

Throughout my life, I’ve traveled more than most, less than few. Finding myself passing by large cities where no one cares to remember one moment to the next, or some local dive spot in the middle of east bumble f\*\*k. I’m sure you’ve traversed through a few of these cities and small towns as well. Either the sheer mass population engulfs the crowd into a whirlwind of once-in-a-lifetime interactions, or a smaller settlement where everyone has a strange resemblance as if third cousins or less. The gathering locations for the social meetup usually are set with dim lighting that aid in the fading moment they’ll all but soon forget — like so many interactions we’ve all let slip into the dark void of non-importance.

When I need perspective outside my own, I test the waters in these unfamiliar places with small talk to gauge which audience member is worth engaging. I’ve always had an intuitive ability to spot the good listener who’ll be truthful versus the “nice person.” With keen observation I’d find people who ask follow-up questions rather than immediately sharing their own stories. I’d notice who listens with their whole attention rather than planning their next response. These were the strangers worthy of my vulnerability. Once the target was acquired, I prepared myself not to become overly emotional when they give an unpleasant answer, remaining quiet instead of countering defensively with “You just don’t understand.”

Unlike most people, I enjoy the microscopic examinations of other’s perspectives who have no skin in the game. The stranger from a distance was the perfect observer who’d never mingled in my affairs, had no interactions with the people being discussed, which in turn created the coveted position of an objective observational status that aided in newfound perspectives. The main concern to be aware of is if the stranger becomes bored with the subject. When/if that happens, I bribe them into listening to my spiel with a free drink or two, but only if I believe they were the right person exhibiting the required attributes to add value to my lack of understanding or, better yet, ignorance.

**My Story: The Perfect Example**

https://preview.redd.it/2p8rvxhy1vmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a0899783754454126d7586854dbc1eb4fdf157f

A prime example of utilizing this tactic was when I used to travel in a converted van. Those were confusing days. If the philosophy stands to be true that time doesn’t exist, and all days are happening at once, then the amount of pity and relief I have for my former self is unquantifiable. God, was I lost in a maze during those ten months. The main reason you might ask: I’d found out that the man I called “Dad” for thirty-odd years was in fact not my father. I was lied to with a certain ease that was far from motherly love and much closer to devilish deceit.

I was enlightened with this newfound information by my older brother who divulged the truth at his son’s high school graduation party. He said, “Mom told a few of her female friends that the timing of your conception didn’t align with when she got back together with Dad.” I asked my older brother, “Why didn’t you tell me sooner?” He stated, “I thought you knew. They didn’t tell you? I thought they would’ve.” This was a constant line he’d use to alleviate any accountability by using ignorance as a defense. Mind you, the entire story he told about multiple friends my mom told was an utter lie in itself, but I’ll get to that.

When I confronted my mom over a phone call, I was met with a nonchalant, “He may not be your father.” For the first time, after asking repeatedly, she finally cracked after I mentioned my older brother’s account.

For years, whenever my mother got upset with my actions, she’d pound a false narrative into my mind by echoing the hypnotic words, “You’re just like your father.” Tell a lie enough times, eventually it becomes the truth. Especially when those words come from those once held in the highest regard believing they exhibited virtues such as integrity and wisdom. They once were the pin to my compass guiding my life choices, never thinking they’d ever lead me astray.

**The Signs Were There**

https://preview.redd.it/93dcy1a32vmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=940fb604111f48c08d92181237f884cabd30519f

I had a hunch since my teens that the man I’d called “Dad” was indeed, not my father. There was only one picture of him in his early twenties where maybe, possibly, we looked slightly similar. Besides that, nothing concrete. Every family barbecue on his side of the family felt awkward. I wasn’t like them, and deep down, I knew they weren’t my family nor my tribe, but nice people nonetheless.

My older brother kept this secret from me for twenty-two years. If you haven’t guessed, I haven’t spoken to him since that day. You must understand, there were many opportunities for him to come clean. I specifically remember telling him at a dive bar in my early twenties that I was seriously considering changing my last name to our mother’s maiden name. A visible anger consumed his face met by an incredulous tone of disloyalty when he asked, “Why would you want to do that?”

He knew then, and not only said nothing, but comfortably led my discernment off kilter further down a hole instead of towards the light he selfishly possessed. You may ask why? I certainly have. The best explanation I’ve ever conceived was the power of knowing your true identity. Where you come from breeds a certain level of individual freedom he wanted some control over. It’s much easier to convince and misdirect someone with false ideas when believing they’re your one hundred percent blood brother.

What makes the entire situation worse were the subtle clues I subconsciously gathered about my older brother’s private conversations with my dad’s side of the family about my true identity. One example being when a group of my cousins stated, “You and you’re dad have the same mannerisms.” My older brother replied, “Those can be learned over time.” Completely clueless to the subtext, I continued on with whatever I was speaking about.

Every family barbecue at a community park, I’d hear my dad’s airhead girlfriend mention, “You don’t look anything like your dad.” It really pissed me off, especially since he stood by her side with a weird smirk while staying silent. As if he gave her the green light to make me question my own identity. Why would he do that? Why not come clean? Why would everyone partake in some weird cult-like behavior to keep my true background a secret, and my biological father’s identity hidden?

**The Backstory: Revenge and Deception**

https://preview.redd.it/lmkrg5k92vmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=1431bba36195174aef3ebd7519d7f16e9a8e11b7

Before fingers get pointed for blame, you must understand: my “dad” was a player all throughout his life. One example of just how low he was willing to go was before I was born. My mother got informed by a girlfriend that she’d seen my “dad” driving around town in my mom’s Ford Mustang with another woman. How my mom tracked them down, I don’t know, but she did. When she confronted them, my mom ended up driving off in her Mustang leaving them both stranded on the side of the road.

My “dad” did this multiple times, and finally my mom wanted payback. The revenge was a one-night stand with his best friend, my biological father. She kept the secret safe and sound until years later after divorcing another man who isn’t important to the story. Freshly divorced, my mom took comfort in my “dad’s” arms. Still being the Casanova he prided himself to be, he introduced my mom to another blonde-haired female with similar characteristics to her except a much weaker version. They hit it off and became friends.

I don’t know the details on what inspired the truthful moment to transpire, but I speculate there was alcohol, maybe a night of a little cocaine and a joint or two. Whatever it was, call it destiny, my mom became overwhelmed with the weight of the lie, coming clean to this newfound blonde-haired friend about my conception being impossible for me to be my “dad’s” son.

Yes, the one-off improbable happening, happened. Created not by some divinely loving union between two souls. Sadly, I spawned from the vices of lust and revenge. When I was born, I had an umbilical cord strangling my neck — life’s attempt to take me out early failed for some reason. I will call it divine fate.

More importantly, after my mom revealed the truth, the blonde-haired woman told not only my “dad,” but my older brother as well. To add another disgusting detail to this story, the blonde-haired woman was in her mid to late thirties, and not only slept with my father, but I speculate she was also sleeping with my older brother. He was nineteen at the time. Granted my older brother wasn’t your typical teenager. He was a six-foot-two, two-hundred-and-twenty-pound stud that had a charm with the ladies. Not to make any excuse for the blonde-haired woman, but it is what it is.

From that point on, my mom despised that woman, my “dad” disappeared and I, a fifteen-year-old boy, was left in the dark about the entire situation. My “dad” must’ve reached out to my biological father because that’s when he showed up, and my mom told a half-truth about him coming around to see her. My biological father never spoke directly to me. Why? I don’t know. My best guess was knowing the nature of my mom’s vindictive tendencies when feeling threatened. I’ve imagined my biological father pulling up to the house stating he’d like to speak to me, and my mom firing back in a witch’s tone used to cast a fatal spell on a mortal enemy, warning him with the one piece of leverage she had: fifteen years of back pay for child support.

https://preview.redd.it/c40x2y3h4vmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc2706eaf96d0697b9d7287a1a288c388d3b122c

**The Financial Reality**

Now let’s do some low-ball calculations for child support payments. Three hundred dollars a month, times fifteen years. That’s over fifty thousand dollars. Adding on to the fact he’d be placing himself on the ringer for all my needs from that day forward. No wonder why my biological father pulled the same David Copperfield trick as my “Dad.” I don’t blame him for not taking on that responsibility when he had his own family with multiple other children.

With that being said, don’t feel bad for him either. He was no saint, and after meeting him enough times, it’s somewhat understandable why my mom didn’t want him around to begin with. To spotlight my biological father’s heinous actions, I’ll tell you about a time I spoke with him in my early thirties, still unaware he was my father. The encounter was set up by my “dad” and older brother knowingly bringing us together at his apartment.

There was a point where it was only my biological father and I sitting in the living room. This man admitted to blowing weed smoke in my face as an infant to stop my crying. He laughed as if he’d said the funniest thing ever. Dumbfounded, I sat in silence, without knowing how to act accordingly to the disturbing information. And that’s why I didn’t blame my mother for shielding my identity as a child.

This man was a bold-faced liar, manipulator, and as selfish as they come. He was divorced by his wife for telling an old high school flame he’d happen to see at a supermarket that his wife who was alive and well, had recently died from cancer. Lying about being a new widower, he asked to take her out on a date. This man lied with a casual ease of flossing corn from his teeth.

**Finding Strangers to Talk To**

All this convoluted information were fragmented pieces to a puzzle shaded in half-truths that inhibited any chance in solving the entire mystery. Without confidence in any of my immediate family, I picked up and left. There was no home surrounded by minds of that sort and the only conceivable solution was to travel in my van in search of a firm setting to catch my breath.

Instead of risking a chance at a DUI drinking at bars, I found an alternative source to numb the pain at local Kava bars in Florida. Kava and kratom are teas (kratom is highly addictive). Both substances extinguish inhibitions, and at these establishments I discovered most people were also running or hiding from their own pain. After a few rounds, it became easy to fall into a heartfelt conversation. A deep reciprocal dialogue would ensue about regret, misfortune, and lessons with some stranger who was readily available to lend an ear.

More times than not, I’d catch a certain familiar shocked gaze, an open mouth with eyes wide due to trumping their story with my account of thirty-six years of conspiracy, secrecy and betrayal. Knowing I’d only be in the location for a night or two, and with nothing but time on my side, I found the secure comfort in these cool cavernous bars to hold nothing back. Most strangers found relief from their problems after hearing my story. They all understood why I left, and the support was immense to never go back to that world full of liars.

Those strangers helped my own memory piece together clues I’d been told for years. Not so much by their questions, which had a constant theme of needing more clarity because the entire story seemed completely irrational. They never actually helped with anything other than allowing my own voice to be heard out loud. All the jumbled pieces came together. Not in that very moment, but later laying in my van alone at night when I was able to filter facts from the fiction.

One prime example of this sifting process was back in my twenties. My mom once stated how much she hated my actual biological father. She posed the story as if he’d shown up to our house when I was fifteen years old in pursuit of reconnecting with her intimately. That was the exact time my “dad” disappeared and didn’t return for six years. I realized this was no coincidence. No, it was intentionally manufactured due to my mother’s secret paternity fraud revealed at that time in my life.

**The Uncle Betrayal**

https://preview.redd.it/dfwlzydt4vmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f8d74a12145c71c9f7ce1aaad7fce67485441c

The main point in exposing a very dark period of my life was not out of some bitter need to blast people’s mistakes on the internet. It’s not due to anger or some jaded sense of needing relief or justice. The reason being is to magnify how crucial it is to keep your wounds guarded from those closest and who know you best. The more regularly a person is in your life, the less likely you want them to have an ugly memory of your scars. Best case scenario they keep what they know quiet. But let’s be real here. People love to gossip, over-analyze, and judge, even with the tiniest details about your life. Don’t hand them a grenade launcher and guide their aim at your critical vulnerabilities.

Unless you’re the compulsive sharer-type, could you imagine telling people you see daily or weekly, a story like this? Why would you?

If you’re one of those people who stand firm on the belief that you have a small circle that you can trust no matter what, remember: at one point, I believed the same. One person in particular I believed in was my uncle. After the fallout with my nuclear family, I went east to visit him. I didn’t immediately blurt out the secret. He was my uncle and it was obvious to him that my happy-go-lucky nature was a bit off. He nudged and nudged, and I did need someone to talk to.

The idea of paying someone three hundred an hour to sit in a comfy recliner was out of the question. And with nowhere else to turn, he eventually wore my defenses down by repeating an honorably solemn vow, “Whatever you tell me, it stays in the vault.” He forgot to mention that the vault doors stayed open during operating hours for all employees and customers to take a long gander at the contents inside. The only secrets he kept were his own. Those he buried deep underground on an unmapped island like a pirate’s treasure.

To be fair, my mom warned, “He can’t be trusted.” It was silly to think there was some lead fortress bond between uncle and nephew. Especially when there’s a juicy story sizzling in the oven with a delicious aroma everyone can smell. I should’ve known the pure contempt he had for my mom would consume him. Once he knew the name of my biological father, an almost elated smirk erected up the right side of his cheek bearing no teeth. He’d met him numerous times and truthfully, it was kind of funny. Because a simple glance at myself in the mirror exposed just how similar we looked. We had the same nose and eyebrows. The main difference was I had a healthy patch of hair on the top of my head and he was Mr. Clean bald. I still thank God that I got my mom’s side of the genes for DHT (Dihydrotestosterone).

To be brief, my uncle wasted no time telling my loud mouth cousin, his son, all my business. The joke was on me. I found out by visiting my cousin a few weeks later when traveling down south in my van. We sat in his living room. He had his cell phone on speaker mode on a three-way call with his mom, and a second cousin. They all loved to incessantly bump their gums. My second cousin asked in the sweetest voice, “How are you? Is everything okay?” I replied in a stoic manner, “I’m fine.” My eyes darted to my cousin’s quivering bottom lip. His inability to make eye contact was a dead giveaway. He understood that I had become aware that he knew things he wasn’t supposed to. Once he hung up the phone, I strategically pressed him in a non-judgmental way. He folded almost immediately into admitting the truth. Once those three were informed, I knew everyone in my entire bloodline had heard the story.

**The Moral**

The moral of the article is either tell no one, or tell strangers, or pay a therapist if you’ve got the money. It’s sad we live in a world where the ones closest to us present the most danger. Oh well. Suck it up, buttercup, it is what it is. Now don’t be foolish and let my story fall on deaf ears and take heed to my advice that applies to more than just dysfunctional family secrets. Do you have career failures, relationship that ended badly, or load of shame you’re carrying? If so, tell a stranger who doesn’t have time to waste unlike a therapist who’ll say, “That’s interesting, let’s dive into that further next week,” as cha-ching sound effects shoot off in their capitalist brains.

Strangers are unpolished and untamed by social restraint, revealing a level of truth that most people will never risk speaking. They won’t recognize you later or care to speak again. Whoever they tell your story to will probably care even less, and best thing of all is, they don’t know you anyway!

I've never once in my life heard Merlin as a name for a real person. I'm pretty sure I've seen it as a punchline on NNCJ. But I had a look at the stats and:

- it made it into the England and Wales top 1000 in 2001
- it was in the US top 1000 until the 1970s, peaking inside the top 300 in the late 1920s
- even in 2024 it was given to 72 American boys, as many as Elton, Irvin, Leopold, Rigoberto, Saleem and Jordon
- it was also in the French top 500 for most of the 2000s

Even so I can't really imagine ordering a coffee and putting down my name as Merlin. It feels too mystical and mythical for the real world. But then again I see Orion and Oberon and Guinevere here and THOSE don't seem too crazy...

1n73azf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n73azf,Cost-per-smile: gifting 28 Nike socks at the office—reaction thread,"Tried a little experiment at work—brought in 28 pairs of socks and handed them out around the office. Honestly, the cost-per-smile turned out to be one of the cheapest morale boosts I’ve ever seen.

Why it worked better than expected:

Universal utility: Everyone can use socks. Doesn’t matter the role, age, or gender—nobody says no to fresh pairs.

Small cost, big reaction: Each pair was barely a couple of bucks, but people acted like they’d just been given a premium gift bag.

Office culture boost: Instead of another box of donuts or generic coffee run, socks actually stuck. People were showing them off, comparing colors, and laughing about “sock day.”

On the flip side, gifting like this also made me realize why socks are such an underrated flip. They’re cheap, universally useful, and create repeat demand. When even coworkers are asking where they can grab more, you know the item has legs.

For anyone curious, this is the direct W2C I used:
👉 W2C https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7258478072&spider_token=6685

So yeah, 28 pairs given, cost-per-smile probably under $0.50. Zero stress, all positive vibes. Sometimes the simplest flips—like socks—end up delivering the best ROI, not just in profit but in reactions.",14,1756867347.0,ReplicaReselling,1,1.0,False

Loved Choo Freeman's name as a kid

Have an odd recollection from high school of watching MLB Tonight talk about Guilder Rodriguez's late September debut for the 60something win Rangers after a 10+ year minor league career and how emotional it was for him and his family. Pretty sure he got the game winning RBI that day too. Struck a chord for me

Saw Matt Clark's first big league homer in 2014 live. He vanished after that September cup of coffee

Was present for (watched on the TV in line for concessions) Seth Mejias-Brean's first big league homer in 2019. He had enormous hands and my girlfriend thought he looked like Waluigi

Sean Lowe pitched 8 innings of 1 run ball at my first ever MLB game. Jose Canseco hit 2 homers that day too

David Manning started for the Brewers the first time I ever went to Miller Park (my favorite team and park) in 2003. He got shelled and he never made it back to the bigs

See explanation for Choo Freeman as it is the same for Tike Redman

I remember Scott Carroll being an old rookie that threw a gem in his debut, outdueling prime David Price and the Rays. He was a very below average 5th starter the rest of the year and only made it back briefly the following 2 years",1,1756867244.0,immaculategrid,0,1.0,False

*“Baseball is 90% mental. The other half is physical.” — Yogi Berra, probably. Or a very serious yoga instructor.*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Who’s the Real MVP?

Let’s start with the numbers. The **Samsung Lions** are the overwhelming favorites here, priced at **-360 to -300** across bookmakers (implied probability: **75–78%**). Kiwoom Heroes, meanwhile, are **+300 to +310** (25–29% implied). That’s like betting on a toaster to beat a chef in a cooking contest—possible, but not advisable unless you’re a fan of burnt baguettes.

The spread is **Samsung -1.5 (-150 to -170)** and Kiwoom +1.5 (+200 to +217). The total runs line sits at **9.5–10.5**, with the **Under** getting better odds (1.8–1.95 vs. 1.8–2.2 for the Over). Samsung’s dominance in the moneyline and spread suggests they’re the team to back, but let’s dig deeper.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Pitchers, Power, and Pasta

The KBO hasn’t spilled much tea about this matchup, but the **Samsung Lions** have been a well-oiled machine this season. Their 1.36–1.4 moneyline pricing implies they’re the league’s version of a “sure thing” (though nothing in sports is ever *that* sure, unless it’s a forfeit). Kiwoom, on the other hand, is the team that forgot to bring their coffee before the game—0–2 against Samsung this season with a 3.47 ERA in those matchups.

Meanwhile, the **Under** on the total is quietly tantalizing. Samsung’s pitching staff has a 4.45 ERA, but their defense has been a fortress, allowing just 4.2 runs per game. Kiwoom’s offense? A leaky faucet. They’re hitting .243 as a team, which is about as exciting as watching a spreadsheet update itself. If this game stays under 10 runs, it’ll be because both

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Hit a Curveball*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The Hanwha Eagles (-1.5, 1.51 implied odds) are the clear favorites here, with implied win probabilities hovering around **62-67%** across bookmakers. That’s the statistical equivalent of a vending machine: reliable, if a little overpriced. The NC Dinos (2.55-2.64 implied odds) are the underdogs, but don’t count them out just yet.

**Totals are the real star of the show**: The Over/Under sits at **8.0-8.5 runs**, with the Over priced at **1.83-1.87** (implied \~53-54% probability). But here’s the kicker—NC’s second baseman **Kim Joo-won** is a one-man fireworks show. He’s hit **13 HRs**, swiped **38 bases**, and has an OPS of **.850** (think of it as a baseball version of a superhero’s power level). If Kim’s bat stays hot, this game could explode like a piñata at a toddler’s birthday party.

**Spread breakdown**: Hanwha’s -1.5 line suggests they’re expected to win by a run and a half. That’s the sportsbook’s way of saying, “We think Hanwha’s pitching staff is less leaky than a sieve, but don’t get too comfortable.”

---

### 2. Digest the News: Kim’s Natural Power, Hanwha’s “Meh” Momentum

NC’s Kim Joo-won is the KBO’s answer to a walking, talking, home-run-hitting espresso shot. In his last game, he hit a solo HR and a two-run double, then shrugged and said, *“Just natural stuff, man.”* His focus on “natural power hitting” is less a strategy and more a declaration of war on opposing pitchers. If he’s anything like a coffee addict on a Monday morning, expect him to dominate.

Meanwhile, the Hanwha Eagles are the KBO’s version of a “meh” response. They’re favored, sure, but their recent performance is as vague as a text from an ex. They’re not blowing anyone away, but they’re also not getting blown out. Think of them

I've never posted anything to Reddit so I'm not sure if I'm doing this right. I also acknowledge how ridiculous and petty this situation is but it has gotten to the point where I am, frankly, about to lose it.

I'm a barista at a coffee chain. The environment at work is pretty relaxed and we all get along well. I've worked with this person, who we'll call S, for a few years.

S is a hard worker and generally pleasant to be around except for the burps. For as long as I've known him he has had not great manners regarding bodily functions. S lets these burps rip unabashedly, doesn't even try to muffle them with his hand or anything. Stops mid-sentence to belch with abandon. He will also release them over the work headset, directly into the ears of his fellow workers! We're talking high fidelity. And these are not normal, chill burps. This man burps like there's something malevolent inside of him trying to escape through his esophagus. These burps are so loud and happen so frequently that honestly it might be a medical concern. I physically recoil from them. I'm not even exaggerating.

I know S can't control them. I think I'd be able to deal if he at least attempted to hide them, but when I say that he absolutely does not give a fuck about the rudeness, *he does not give a fuck*. He knows they bother me because I have told him so. ""Hey, S, can you not burp into the mic?"" ""S, could you cover your mouth?"" It literally takes everything in me to remain professional and patient when I address him about it. It's like a silly joke for him I think? When he does say excuse me, he says it like a mischievous little burp imp, like I'm the crazy one for being so bothered.

Am I the crazy one? This post is so long. There isn't even a real solution to this because it's not like S can just stop burping. But it's rude, right? I don't want to have a sit down, serious conversation with this adult man about his uncontrollable bodily functions but that's kind of where I am.

I didn’t want to talk. I didn’t want to scroll. I didn't want to see anybody or hear anything either. I didn’t want to do anything.​But, I did do one last thing...I turned on a hot shower, grabbed my soap, and let the hot water run. Just letting go of everything else.​Now, the long list of things to do was still there. But, what this shower did do was remind me that it's okay to stop. Put a period on the end of the day. It's okay to move slow and be tired. You don't have to earn your rest. Just step back a moment- and allow space for a hot shower with a soap that smells ""oh so good"" to hep you reset. And when you choose to listen to your body, instead of push on...You wake up the next day feeling refreshed and ready to tackle everything else for the day without having to reach for coffee or an energy drink first. You deserve a restful night of sleep. You deserve to feel loose, instead of heavy. You deserve to feel like yourself. And that is enough.

Before giving it to me he opened it up and cleaned it thoroughly. It worked perfectly fine, but recently it started giving me smaller coffees somehow? The coffee amount is set to the same volume as before. 

Shortly after it started happening the machine asked me to do a descaling. I figured it was the cause of the smaller coffees, but I did it with the tablets I got from the machine (not jura tablets) and it didn't fix the issue. On top of that, the steam valve seems partially clogged or something now? When I activate it it will take around 10 seconds before it starts shooting steam. Water is still instant though. Also this may be just the milk  frother being dirty but it started blasting milk everywhere when I use it... So my 14 seconds time I set for a cappuccino doesn't give me the correct amount at all.

The ingredients of the descaler: citric acid, sodium bisulfate, sodium carbonate, sodium gluconate, sodium acetate, polyethylene glycol.

I’m a deeply feeling introvert who spends a lot of time on health, fitness (yes, I’m a bit of a fanatic and proud of being in great shape), nutrition, and spirituality-lately learning more about Advaita. I throw myself into the things I care about, whether that’s work, friendships, or simply living everyday life with intention. I’m equally comfortable debating world affairs, swapping travel stories, or laughing over something completely silly.

I also know that two people coming together to build a life isn’t easy. What makes it work, I believe, are respect, trust, and a lasting friendship to carry you through the tougher parts.

Who I imagine you to be:

You laugh easily, say funny things, and love when I do the same.
You are my BFF and do not roll your eyes when I use the term BFF.
You are damn smart – but not a snob about it. You are in love with life. Family comes first. 
You do not mistake my warmth, love, and affection for weakness.
You do what you love. You make the best of any situation.
You share your chips with me. You will come with me for walks. 
You love hard, fight fair, and balance modern independence with a touch of old-school kindness.
Compassion and generosity guide your choices, and you always try to see the best in people.

Simply put, you inspire me and are inspired by me. That’s the kind of bond I’m looking for—one that’s deep and supportive, but also light-hearted and adventurous.

So what say - shall we travel, smash patriarchy, cook healthy, work out often, make memories, and open our hearts and minds?

Leave those chips, candy bars or anything else behind. Also redbulls, coffee and all that stuff. 

Tip 2: If you received bad news that day, don't take the test if it's possible. Explain your situation and let yourself get over it because it will be stucked in your mind during testing I promise.

Tip 3: Make fun flashcards. I like using black, blue and red pens. I make tons of drawings and relate words to sounds, animals, other languages, or just things in general that will help me remember.

Tip 4: REST, don't be on your phone that night and don't pull an ""All nighter"" it won't help and you'll kill your brain cells

Tip 5: You know that topic that you swear it won't be on the test? It will and you'll regret not studying it enough.

Tip 6: Don't study a bunch of things on one day, you won't retain a single thing. 

Tip 7: Enter confident to that room. Confidence is the key. If you are insecure you will sabotage yourself. Study and dong avoid getting nervous because you will but don't let it get onto you.

Tip 8: Friends might help but only some, be selective with who you study with

However, this morning I was tempted to but thankfully support responded to my ‘bug glitch’ issue I was having with the cafe operation event (screenshots attached). 

Is everyone already aware that the coffee machine (after already spending energy to create it) is meant to disappear after a few clicks? Is it written anywhere or am I gaslighting myself? Personally, I feel like this ‘design choice’ is so scammy. Even if it’s written somewhere (I don’t read the rules of the events - maybe I should start 🤦‍♀️), I believe this feature is a transparent attempt to force people to spend money. Maybe it feels like a big deal to me because I’m pretty horrible at the cafe operation event, after regularly using energy and spending approximately 600 diamonds I was only able get the Velvet Hour ‘Lullaby’ dress and ‘purple haze’ ring (very disappointing as I loved the outfit).

1n730en,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n730en/the_man_who_stepped_backward/,The Man Who Stepped Backward,"I should never have let him in. I knew it then and I damn well know it now, but hindsight’s a bitch. I keep telling myself that if I had just ignored the banging on my door, if I had just stayed my ass in bed…well, maybe none of this would be happening to me.

But guess what I did?

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

It was around 3am, a few nights ago, and I was lying in bed doom scrolling as usual. You know, typical night owl behavior. I live alone in a one-bedroom near Dallas: nothing to write home about, but it’s been home for about 3 years now, peeling paint, busted blinds and all.

I had just decided to put my phone down and try to get some sleep (for probably the 10^(th) time) when the banging started. Not knocking, mind you, but *banging*. Desperate, frantic, as if someone were throwing their whole-body weight against the door.

The first thought that crossed my mind was “*oh shit, someone’s being chased!”*

The second was *“why me?”*

But that sound…that banging? You can’t really fake that type of frenzy.

So against the better voices in my head, I got out of bed, walked out into the living room and opened the door.

Standing outside on my “unless you have pizza, go away” door mat was a guy probably around my age: mid-twenties, maybe. He was pale, gaunt (in the sense that he could use a pizza himself…) and his eyes were bloodshot as if he hadn’t slept in days.

The clothes he was wearing looked…odd, to be PC about it. He was wearing torn boots laced with wire, a jacket patched by hand, stitched together with varied pieces fabric that didn’t go together at all, and on the sleeve was an insignia which looked military in nature, half-burned away as if someone tried to erase it and only partially succeeded.

He startled and stared at me as if *I* were the one causing a ruckus in the middle of the night on a Thursday.

“They said I’d land in *before*,” he rasped, his voice sounding cracked and in need of hydration. “Is this before?”

“Erm…” I laughed nervously, peering outside to see if someone were filming this as some sort of weird tiktok trend. “I’m sorry, before what? Do you know what time it is?”

Without warning, he pushed past me, barreling into my apartment, and I immediately went into *oh shit* mode.

“Hey, whoa my guy! You can’t just come in here. Who the hell are you?”

As he was scraping past me, I caught a whiff of him and boy did he smell. Like a mixture of smoke and iron…but not any sort of iron I’d ever smelled before. It was a chemical-y smell, acrid, like burnt circuitry mixed with wet earth and something coppery…blood, maybe?

He peered around my living room like an awestruck tourist, his body shaking, though I couldn’t tell if it were from fear or some weird kindof excitement. He went around the room, touching my lamp, my phone charger, even a pile of assorted junk mail sitting on the coffee table.

He stopped and looked at me, a grin slowly spreading across his manic face. “Still work,” he whispered, more to himself than to me. “There’s still electricity, still light.”

I cleared my throat and repeated myself, asking who he was and if he were in some sort of trouble or danger.

He froze, his eyes filling with tears, and then he smiled. A broken, horrible smile.

“You don’t have them yet. They haven’t come.”

“What don’t we have?” I asked, starting to get annoyed.

He was bouncing with what I assumed was happiness at this point. “The Flags.”

He stopped, his voice dropping into something barely audible.

“You’ll know them when they come…same flag on every house, in every classroom, waving in every patch of sky they can reach. They watch you through it, your every single move. The flags aren’t fabric – it’s an *eye*, somehow…you look at it once and you can feel them looking back, watching.”

My stomach twisted, and my annoyance grew.

But he continued, seemingly impervious to the look of irritation I knew was written on my face. “They…they take the children first. One morning, buses came and picked them up, but never brought them home. Feeds on all security cameras went dark. They said the kids were being *re-educated*. That word means something terrifying there.”

Then he grabbed my wrist, his grip ice-cold against the warmth of my own skin. He held my wrist so tightly that I couldn’t pull away.

“Don’t let them tell you that safety is worth obedience,” he whispered, his voice dropping even lower. “That’s how it all starts. Curfews, registries…neighbors disappearing until people simply stop asking questions. And then—”

He stopped, mid-sentence, a look of renewed horror etching itself upon his face. His whole body began to shudder and shake violently, to the point I thought maybe he was OD’ing or having a seizure or something. His mouth remained open, but no words came out.

At that moment, the lights in my apartment begin to flicker and buzz but not like some normal power surge. The bulbs dimmed *red*, twice, like some sorta fucked up electrical heartbeat.

He panicked, and blood began to pour from his nose and down his face, dripping onto his clothes and then onto my carpet.

“hey! Oh my god, are you okay?! I’m going to call 911—”

“NO!”

He gripped my wrist even tighter, trying to pull me closer to him. My flight-or-flight instincts began to kick in, and my body was wanting to choose fight. I balled my fists, preparing to defend myself if need be, though I’m no fighter by any means and was more or less counting on him being weak due to his size.

“Let me go, now.”

“Oh god, no!” He was ignoring me now, due to  the skin blistering around his mouth as if he’d touched something corrosive to his lips. He began clawing in his jacket, fumbling around for something when he suddenly pulled out a small black cube, about the size of a car key fob. Coming from the cube was a humming noise, as if it held a trapped insect of some kind.

He shoved into my hands roughly, his skin literally cracking and burning where it held the cube, but he didn’t let it go until I took hold of it.

“If it hums again, *don’t answer it*, no matter what!” he commanded, his voice all of a sudden resolute. “Curiosity may get the better of you, and you may think it’s me. But it’s not me. They wear us like clothes.”

“What the fu—”

Without waiting to answer any sort of questions or to elaborate (as if anything he’d said up to this point made a lick of sense), he turned to my front door, closed it, turned and looked at me, blinked twice, then opened the door again and stepped through it.

Only…he didn’t step outside.

Instead, I swear to all that’s holy, I saw space *bend* around the frame of my front door and beyond, as if the air were water and he was slipping beneath the surface. And the sound was like the tearing of fabric. But then he was gone.

I stood there, dumbstruck, sure that maybe I was the one on drugs (though I definitely was not) and this was just a really strange trip.

A solid five minutes passed before I caught myself and slowly walked over to the door and poked my head through it, looking uneasily around the empty corridor.

He was definitely gone.

For a brief moment I thought maybe I’d just had some sort of waking dream and that everything that just happened were a figment of my imagination. But I looked down at my hand and I was still clasping that little black cube, which had fallen silent.

Just for shits and giggles, I looked outside one more time and then slammed the door shut and locked every lock on it, and then sunk to the floor, my back resting against it.

“What the actual *fuck* just happened?”

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I didn’t get any sleep that night. The smell of the guy lingered in my apartment until well past dawn. No amount of febreezing helped.

I put the cube on my coffee table and left it there. It’s actually pretty heavy, unnaturally so, for its size, and the edges are sharp…sharp enough to cut you if you hold it the wrong way. It hasn’t made a single sound since the man forced it onto me and then vanished. But as I’ve sat and watched it, sometimes I think I hear a faint scratching sound, like fingernails on glass.

I don’t know what to do with it. Google’s been unhelpful in identifying it and chatgpt says I should either destroy it or take it to the cops. I thought about hiding it away and just forgetting about it, but I don’t know.

Part of me is intrigued by it.

And then part of me wants to believe that it was just the ramblings of some random, insane dude who, for whatever reason, happened to stumble into my apartment building (which is code-locked now that I remember…). Maybe he *was* on drugs of some kind or maybe he was in the grips of some sort of manic paranoia.

But I can’t stop thinking of the way the world looked when he just disappeared. And his words still ring in my ears, leaving tinges of fear and uncertainty:

“You’ll know them when they come.”

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This all happened a few nights ago...and for the first couple of days, the cube was just that: a cube. Silent, still, just a weird thing taking up space on my table. 

Then, late last night...it hummed. I heard it from my bedroom. It was just once, but it was enough. The sound was low, like a bass note I could literally feel in my teeth. 

I slowly walked into the living room, wielding a plastic cosplay sword (you know, to do some damage if need be) but the living room was still. 

I looked at the cube from a distance, but didn't touch it. I somehow felt that would result in my ""answering it,"" which the dude explicitly instructed me *not to do*. 

But as I was looking at it, I think for a split second I saw something shift across its surface. Not a reflection but almost as if...something inside were pushing outward. 

Oh and that scratching sound I was hearing? Yea, it's gotten louder now. I can't tune it out no matter what I do. 

I don't know what the fuck is going to happen when/if it hums again, and I'm almost sure that I definitely do not want to know...",1,1756866483.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1n7303s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1n7303s/i_work_the_night_shift_at_a_chihuahuan_desert_in/,I work the night shift at a chihuahuan desert in texas… it had strange rules to follow.,"**You ever wonder what kind of job makes a man come apart at the seams—fracture not over weeks or years, but in one single, black-lunged night?**

Not from stress. Not from boredom. But from something *else*. Something dry and crawling that licks at the edge of your sanity like windblown sand against old bone.

Yeah, I used to wonder that too.

Now I don't wonder much of anything. My thoughts come slow, like they’ve got to drag themselves up through molasses. I don’t sleep—not really. When I do, I hear the whispering. I see flickers in corners that should be empty. I don’t trust my reflection anymore. I don’t trust my own **voice**. Something came back with me from that place. Something I never invited.

The job was simple—or so I thought. One night shift in the middle of nowhere. And a list of rules. Just twelve of them. Keep your head down. Stay awake. Follow the rules. But rules mean nothing when the air itself wants to gut you. When silence starts to hum. When shadows **breathe**.

Let me take you back to the beginning.

My name’s Eric. I’m 28 years old, though now I feel older—worn down like desert stone under centuries of wind. I’ve never been the stay-in-one-place kind of guy. I’ve chased hurricanes on oil rigs, run toward wildfires when everyone else ran away, and even launched myself off rooftops for a few thousand YouTube subscribers back in the day. I guess you could say danger was my drug. I didn’t just flirt with risk—I waltzed with it, arms wide, laughing in its face.

So when I saw the job post—a night watch gig at an isolated weather station in the far reaches of West Texas—it felt like a gift. The pay was suspiciously good. The location? Dead center of the Chihuahuan Desert, fifty miles off any real road. No towns. No neighbors. No signal. Just a pin on a map and a time to show up.

I packed light: books I wouldn’t read, a journal I wouldn’t write in, and that stupid optimism only people who haven’t been broken yet still carry.

The outpost—Station 119B—was a concrete box. One room. No markings, no signs of life. Just a dented steel door and a big black window staring out at an endless stretch of sand. Inside, there was a desk cluttered with equipment I couldn’t name, a fridge, a cot, and a generator that sounded like it was one bad night away from dying. But what caught my attention wasn’t any of that.

It was the manual.

A thin, grease-stained pamphlet on the desk, labeled in crooked red ink:

**RULES FOR NIGHT SHIFT OPERATOR – STATION 119B**

Not instructions. Not training. *Rules*.

There were twelve.

And they weren’t the kind of rules you find in HR handbooks. They read like folklore passed down from some ancient desert cult.

1. **Do not open the door between 12:13 AM and 1:34 AM, no matter who is knocking.**  
2. **If you hear tapping on the window, turn off all lights and lie face down until it stops.**  
3. **Log wind speed every 30 minutes. If wind speed hits 0, hide in the supply closet until it rises again.**  
4. **If the generator goes out, light the red emergency candle. Never use a flashlight.**  
5. **Do not acknowledge voices calling your name from outside.**  
6. **If the desert goes silent (no wind, no bugs), recite the phrase taped to the fridge.**  
7. **Check the sand just outside the door every hour. If footprints appear going in but not out, call Base Code: Yellow Echo.**  
8. **If the phone rings more than once per night, unplug it.**  
9. **Never look at the reflection in the window after 2:44 AM.**  
10. **Don’t fall asleep.**  
11. **Don’t eat the food in the fridge after midnight.**  
12. **If Rule 1 is broken, burn the manual immediately and pray.**  

I read them again. And again. Each pass made my skin prickle. It was like reading a curse disguised as policy. But instead of walking away, **I laughed. Really laughed—sharp, barked out loud like a man who thinks he’s above fear**—because I was still the guy who thought ghosts were fun stories and rules were made to be tested.

It sounded strange in that room—too loud, too human. It bounced off the concrete walls like it didn’t belong there. Maybe it didn’t.

In my head, this was all just some elaborate hazing ritual. A creepy prank left behind by some disgruntled ex-employee with a flair for drama. I imagined a guy like me—bored, probably high—scribbling down those rules just to mess with the next poor sucker assigned to Station 119B. The candle, the weird times, the chanting. Classic psychological tripwire stuff. Probably some government joke I wasn’t in on.

Still… the place didn’t sit right with me.

The air was too dry. Not just desert-dry, but hollow, like the atmosphere had been *scooped out*. The silence felt rehearsed. Choreographed. And the stars above the station—they didn’t twinkle. They just *watched*. Cold, close, too sharp. Like pinholes poked through a thin sheet of sky. If you stared too long, you got the feeling something might stare back.

But I told myself, *I’ve jumped out of planes. I’ve stood on collapsing fire lines. I’ve put my own damn hand in a box full of scorpions on a dare for likes*. What’s a little ghost story in the desert?

The first couple hours passed like I expected: dull, dry, and quiet. I logged the wind speed like Rule #3 said, every thirty minutes. I even timed it with my watch to be precise—treating it more like a chore than a warning. I made some instant coffee that tasted like regret. I watched a tarantula the size of my palm crawl across the outside of the window—slow, aimless, like it knew it was being watched.

Then, around midnight, things started to… bend. Not snap. Not break. Just *bend*, subtly, like the world had gone a few degrees off center.

It was **12:11 AM** when I heard the knock.

A sound so *ordinary* it felt impossible for it to feel *so wrong*.

Not banging. Not frantic. Just three knocks—spaced out. *Intentional*. Like whoever was outside wasn’t asking to be let in. They were stating they were already here.

Every hair on my neck stood at attention. My hands clenched around the mug before I realized they were shaking.

My mind stumbled back to Rule #1: *Do not open the door between 12:13 AM and 1:34 AM, no matter who is knocking.*

I froze. My thoughts tried to be logical, tried to be brave. *Probably just the wind,* I whispered to myself, though the words felt hollow even as I said them.

But the wind doesn’t knock. It howls. It hisses. It dances through cracks and moans through empty places. It doesn’t walk up to a reinforced steel door and knock *three times, exactly*, then stop.

I checked the wall clock.

**12:13 AM.**

My throat tightened like I’d swallowed dry sand. My legs screamed to move—toward the door, away from it, I didn’t even know. But I stayed still. Not because I believed the rule. No, not yet. But because something in my gut, something primal and old, told me that opening that door would be a very *final* kind of mistake.

The knocks came again. Same rhythm. Three. Then silence.

**12:20.** More knocks.

**12:29.** Again.

**12:41.** They kept coming—every few minutes. Always three. Always the same weight behind them. As if the thing on the other side had all the time in the world.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t speak. I just sat there, heart hammering, watching the second hand crawl across the clock face like it was moving through tar.

Then came the tapping.

*Not on the door.*

On the *window*.

A soft, delicate *tap-tap-tap*, like fingernails on glass.

I turned slowly—deliberately—expecting to see something. *Anything*. A face. A shape. But the window showed only the dark, stretching desert. Pale sand under a black sky. Empty. Still.

Then: *tap-tap-tap.*

Right against the glass. Closer this time. More urgent. Like whatever was outside had grown impatient.

Something deep in me—some instinct older than thought—screamed to obey the manual.

I threw the lights off and dropped flat to the floor, face down, just like Rule #2 demanded.

And let me tell you—I felt *ridiculous*. Lying on cold concrete like a scolded child playing hide and seek. My breath echoed in my ears, too loud, too fast. The tapping continued—soft, steady, like it was trying to coax me up.

I didn’t move.

The darkness stretched forever.

Finally—mercifully—the tapping stopped.

I waited. Ten seconds. Twenty. Then, slowly, I pushed myself up, muscles aching from the tension. I flicked the lights back on and blinked into the sterile brightness.

Then, like a complete jackass, I laughed at myself.

*Real mature,* I thought. *Terrified by shadows and knocks like I’m in a Halloween special.*

But the laughter didn’t stick this time. It crumbled in my throat like dry paper.

Because as I stood there, letting my pulse settle, my eyes drifted toward the wind monitor on the desk.

And it was flatlining.

**Zero.**

No wind. Not even a whisper.

My stomach dropped.

Rule #3 roared back into my mind like a siren:

*If wind speed hits 0, hide in the supply closet until it rises again.*

And suddenly, I wasn’t laughing anymore.

I checked the wind monitor again, hoping—*praying*—I’d read it wrong.

**Wind Speed: 0 mph.**

Nothing. Not a breeze. Not a whisper. The line on the graph was dead flat, like a heartbeat that had given up.

My chest tightened—squeezed from the inside like my lungs were folding in. That couldn’t be right. Out here, the wind never stopped completely. Even the still nights carried a faint, restless stir through the sand. But now? The world outside was holding its breath.

I should’ve stayed inside.

But something pulled me toward the door. Not curiosity—*denial*. That desperate human instinct to confirm the lie, to tell yourself everything’s fine if you can just *see* it for yourself.

I stepped outside.

And immediately felt the weight of a mistake settle on me like lead.

The air was… *wrong*. Not just calm—*dead*. Still in a way that felt manufactured, unnatural. Even my own breathing sounded too loud. There was no wind. No rustle of dry shrubs. No skittering bugs. Nothing but the crunch of my boots on sand.

The desert had gone mute.

And then I saw them.

Footprints.

In the sand, just a few feet from the threshold.

Coming *in*.

But none going out.

I stood there for a full, frozen second, my body refusing to catch up to what my brain was screaming. Then instinct kicked in—I spun, bolted for the door, slammed it shut behind me like it might keep something out that had already gotten in.

Lock. Chain. Bolt. I checked everything. Hands trembling. Breath sharp and uneven.

And then my stomach twisted as another rule clawed its way up from memory:

**Rule #7: Check the sand just outside the door every hour. If footprints appear going in but not out, call Base. Code: Yellow Echo.**

The satellite phone was right where it had been—on the desk, a grey relic from another era. I grabbed it like a lifeline, dialed the code with fingers that barely obeyed me.

It rang.

Once.

Twice.

Then it connected.

And what I heard next nearly stopped my heart.

It was *my voice*. But not like a recording. It was *live*. It was *me*. Except it wasn’t. The cadence was slightly wrong. The tone a hair off. Too calm. Too final.

""You shouldn’t have opened the door,"" it said.

*Click.*

Silence.

I stood there, staring at the receiver like it might explain itself. Then I yanked the cord from the back. The phone went dead.

That’s when the lights cut out.

All at once.

Like someone had flipped a master switch on reality.

Total blackness swallowed the room. The kind of black that has *depth*. Like it could reach out and touch you back.

I didn’t breathe. Didn’t move.

Then my memory jolted into motion—*Rule #4: If the generator goes out, light the red emergency candle. Never use a flashlight.*

I scrambled to the shelf, nearly knocking over the chair in the dark. My fingers found the candle—a thick, stubby thing already set in a glass holder. I fumbled for the lighter, struck it, and lit the wick with a hand that couldn’t stop shaking.

A small, flickering flame sprang to life.

And the room changed.

The dim red light didn’t just reveal the space—it *warped* it. Shadows twisted too far into the corners, stretching longer than they should. The air shimmered, barely perceptible, like heat off asphalt—but colder. The walls felt too close now, as if the room had been inching inward, shrinking around me when I wasn’t looking.

I turned slowly, and for just a breath, I thought I saw movement in the reflection of the window. Not a shape. Not a face. Just *shifting*. The kind of thing your brain registers an instant too late.

That’s when I heard it.

A whisper.

Soft. Barely audible. But unmistakable.

""Eric.""

My name.

It wasn’t shouted. It wasn’t angry. It was… *gentle*. Almost caring. Like the voice of someone who knew me. Loved me. Wanted me to trust it.

But it didn’t come from the door.

And it didn’t come from outside.

It came from *somewhere*. From *everywhere*. Inside the room. Behind the walls. In the space under the cot. In the reflection in the window I wasn’t supposed to look at. My skin crawled. My mouth went dry. My heart slammed against my ribs like it was trying to run for the door by itself.

**Rule #5: Do not acknowledge voices calling your name from outside.**

But was it outside?

I didn’t know.

And that’s what terrified me most.

I clenched my jaw, shut my eyes, and forced myself not to move. Not to speak.

The voice came again.

""Eric,"" it whispered. Closer this time. Like it had crossed a threshold.

*Like it was already inside.*

I clutched the manual like a child clings to a teddy bear in the dark, desperate for comfort that paper couldn’t possibly give. My arms wrapped around it as if the ink inside could somehow shield me from whatever *else* was breathing in that room with me.

Then I heard it.

The fridge.

Buzzing.

Low, mechanical. A sound so ordinary it shouldn't have chilled my blood. But in that moment, it was like hearing a coffin creak open by itself. My eyes snapped open. The red candle flickered wildly, the flame stuttering as if suffocating in air that was too still, too heavy.

Then came the silence.

Not quiet—*silence*. The kind that doesn’t just fill the room but *consumes* it.

No wind. No bugs. No low hum from the machines that had kept me grounded in reality for the past few hours. Even the candle’s flicker made no sound.

Just an aching, crushing stillness.

Rule #6. My breath hitched.

I bolted toward the fridge, legs trembling like they didn’t belong to me. My fingers scrambled along the metal door until they found it: a small, weathered strip of paper taped just above the handle.

The writing was faint, as though the ink had tried to escape the words it formed.

**“O watcher of dusk, I stand still in your silence. Pass me by.”**

My lips moved before I could think.

“O watcher of dusk…” I began, my voice cracking like an old record. “I stand still in your silence. Pass me by.”

It felt like trying to speak underwater. My tongue stumbled over the rhythm the first few times, the words sticking to my throat like glue.

I repeated the phrase. Again. And again. Louder.

And then—I *heard* it.

The silence shattered.

A sudden gust slammed against the walls of the outpost, making the concrete groan in protest. Wind howled through unseen cracks. Insects returned in a chorus of buzzing, scratching life. The room *breathed* again.

And I—God help me—I nearly cried.

But the relief lasted all of three seconds.

Then the phone rang.

That shouldn’t have been possible.

I had *unplugged* it. Pulled the cord straight out of the back. I stared at the empty socket, then at the receiver.

It rang again.

And again.

**Three times total.**

Rule #8 screamed through my skull: *If the phone rings more than once per night, unplug it.*

I already had.

I backed away, the manual still clutched in one hand, candle in the other. My eyes flicked to the wall clock.

**2:51 AM.**

And just like that, another rule surfaced.

Rule #9: *Never look at the reflection in the window after 2:44 AM.*

I hadn’t meant to. I swear I hadn’t.

But the moment I thought it, I *looked*.

And that’s when I saw it.

Not in the window itself, but in the *reflection*. In the far corner of the room, behind me—a tall, human-shaped figure. Perfectly still. Head cocked slightly to one side like it was trying to *understand* me.

My breath caught in my throat like a wire pulled tight.

I turned.

Nothing there.

I whipped back to the window—and it was still there. Same spot. Same tilt of the head.

Watching.

Unmoving.

I lit another red candle. Then another. My hands moved on instinct now—desperation drowning thought. The room bathed in flickering crimson light. Shadows danced madly along the walls.

The figure remained. Still. Patient.

Then—I blinked.

And it was gone.

Just gone.

No sound. No movement. Like it had never been there.

But I *knew* it had.

My instincts screamed: *Get out. Get in the truck. Drive until the sky changes.*

But the manual… it said nothing about leaving. Not once.

And suddenly that absence felt deliberate.

Like the rules had never been written for *leaving*.

Only for *surviving until morning*.

And morning felt very, very far away.

Then it hit me—*Rule #11*.

**Don’t eat the food in the fridge after midnight.**

Simple. Strange. I'd read it like a joke the first time. But now, it loomed in my mind like a warning carved into the walls of a tomb. Something churned in my gut—hunger, maybe. Or dread wearing hunger’s mask.

I moved toward the fridge.

Every part of me screamed *don’t*, but my hand gripped the handle anyway. It was cold. Damp with condensation.

I opened it.

And found… nothing.

Not empty shelves. Not expired leftovers.

*Nothing.*

Every item that had been there earlier—gone. Erased. As if they'd never existed.

Except for one thing.

A single, folded note resting where the milk used to be.

I unfolded it slowly, heart pounding like a drumbeat in a funeral march.

**“Don’t look at the window again.”**

That was it. No explanation. No name. Just that one line, like the fridge itself was whispering.

My hand trembled as I slammed the door shut.

Then—*knock knock knock*.

Again.

Same rhythm. Same weight.

The sound drilled into me, stripped away whatever calm I had left. My whole body tensed, but this time, instinct didn’t scream. This time, I didn’t freeze.

I glanced at the clock.

**1:35 AM.**

I blinked.

*Wait.*

That was past the time window. Rule #1 ended at 1:34 AM.

Technically… I could open the door.

And I did.

Cautiously. Slowly. Holding my breath like it might make a difference.

I opened the door.

And saw nothing.

Just the empty desert, black sky overhead, wind rustling sand like whispers too quiet to understand.

But then—I looked down.

And that’s when my stomach dropped.

A second manual lay on the ground.

Different cover. Thicker.

Stamped in large, blood-red lettering:

**“Rules for Eric – Night Two.”**

Night *two*.

There wasn’t supposed to be a night two.

I wasn’t coming back. No one was.

That’s when I realized the truth.

This place—Station 119B—wasn’t a weather station. It never had been. It was a *test*. A ritual. A trap.

And I wasn’t an employee.

I was a subject. A sacrifice. A participant in something I didn’t understand and could never escape.

Maybe I hadn’t broken Rule #1. Not technically.

But I didn’t care about technicalities anymore.

I was done playing by *their* rules.

I walked back inside, teeth clenched, and dropped the new manual into the candle flame.

**Just like Rule #12 said: If Rule #1 is broken, burn the manual immediately… and pray.**

The paper caught instantly. The flame *devoured* it. Pages curled and blackened, the fire dancing like it had a mind of its own.

Like it was *laughing*.

I backed away.

That’s when the room changed.

Instantly.

No warning. No flicker. Just *gone*.

The cot—gone. The fridge—gone. The desk, the equipment, the satellite phone—all erased.

The room had reset.

Same size. Same shape. Same walls.

But stripped bare.

Just me.

The window.

And the candle.

My breath came in shallow gulps.

Then came the tapping.

But this time—it wasn’t on the glass.

It was *inside* the walls.

Light, skittering taps at first. Then heavier. Then moving.

Circling me.

Like something was crawling through the concrete. Tracing a spiral I couldn’t see. Trapping me in the center.

My mouth opened, but no sound came out.

And then—I remember screaming.

I don’t remember *why*, exactly.

Only that my voice tore from my throat like it was trying to escape without me. I remember scratching at the door. Fingernails splitting against steel. I remember the candle going out.

And I remember the shadows.

They *crawled* under my skin.

Not metaphorically. I could *feel* them. Like black centipedes burrowing through my veins. Eating their way into my thoughts.

Then—

Nothing.

I woke up at dawn.

Face down in the dirt, fifty yards from the station. My clothes damp with dew. My hands shaking.

My car keys clenched tight in one fist.

The manual—gone.

I stumbled back to the building.

The door hung open. No lock. No chain.

Inside?

Empty.

No furniture. No gear. No candles.

Only one thing remained.

A mirror.

Taped to the center of the window.

I walked up to it.

I should’ve turned away.

I should’ve remembered Rule #9.

But I looked.

And what looked back wasn’t me.

It wore my face—but not my *eyes*.

The eyes were wide. Too wide. Stretched like the skin around them had been peeled back.

They were black, bottomless. Not hollow, but *full*—of things I couldn’t describe. Things that watched from the other side of glass. Things that waited.

Things that *remembered*.

Now?

I don’t take jobs anymore. I don’t go outside after dark. I stay indoors. I keep the lights on. I pretend the rules still protect me.

But nights are hard.

Sometimes I hear knocking.

**Always three times.**

And if the wind ever dies completely…

I stop breathing.

Just in case it's still out there.

Waiting for me to forget the rules.

Even just once.",1,1756866460.0,Ruleshorror,2,1.0,False

1n72vjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1n72vjf/extreme_sensitivity_to_everything_post_trauma/,Extreme sensitivity to everything post trauma?,"Ive been dealing with specific post traumatic symptoms that are truly ruling my life. Long story short, i went through an emotional trauma that reopened my childhood trauma that was never processed. It threw me into total shock/depersonalization/dysregulation. I thought i was going to split in half from the shock. I was shaking nonstop for months. I landed in the er because it legit felt like my brain exploding. I felt a complete void in my stomach and the only way i couldve comforted myself was through food. I would throw up every morning. Go into panic constantly. This went on for a few months. I would go from a sympathetic state of panic to a dorsal vagal state often. I went on lexapro and it helped alot. Therapy helped alot too. 3 years later i am working with a somatic/IFS therapist and its been wonderful. 

However, the lasting effects of trauma are still present to a lesser degree. I experience everything so intensely. Emotional processing has gotten better, but when i come down from them my body shakes. Ive developed this insane sensitivity to so many stimulants. Cannot have many things i used to be able to - coffee, b vitamins, ashwaghanda, matcha, high dose vitamins. Its made me fear avoidant with ingesting everything. Its no way to live. Part of me worries my brain chemistry has been so altered that theres no going back and im forever broken. I also feel like something blocks me from letting joy in. I have to think realllyyyy hard and sit in it to allow it to run through me. My brain just works differently now.. i procrastinate more, i push things off my schedule, i get overwhelmed more easily. Its hard to manage. 

Note: I am in therapy for 12 years now. Active yogi, and other somatic practices. Before anyone says anything.. i am doing all the things. It is however, challenging to still navigate when these biological symptoms are present. Has anyone experienced such sensitivity after trauma? How did u cope? ",1,1756866086.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

1n72uyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy_Universe/comments/1n72uyv/aura_at_a_college/,Aura at a College,"It began at the library.

Or rather, at my homework spot on the college campus. I had previously tried studying at a different spot by a different fountain, but there were too many people. And two boys were right in front of my table, talking, loud as could be. I had my AirPods with me. I suppose I could have just put them in and blocked them out, but I suppose I was too stubborn. I don’t like to study with too many people around.

I was in the middle of writing a comparison of Bojack Horseman to St. Augustine when the feeling began: an aura, the feeling a person with epilepsy gets when they feel they might have a seizure. Mine are often empty threats, but this one threatened to bite. I stopped writing about how similar the hit Netflix show’s ideology was to that of the honored Saint whose writing will never die. I was hungry. The fix seemed simple: there was a bakery in the library. They sold sandwiches there, real, good food. I had bought a caramel macchiato  from them about 20 minutes ago. It was the best coffee I’d had in my life.



Something hit me when I entered the library. I suspect it was the lighting, or maybe I got too inside my own head and thought my aura worse than it actually was? Either way, it began to get worse. I turned my head quickly to the menu, right before the cashier spoke.

“Our Turbo-Maker broke. We can’t make anything except the TBA right now.”

My instant reaction was confusion. What’s a TBA? To Be Announced? The Bride Abandoned? That Bad Actress? None of those made sense in that context. 

I cautiously asked her what a TBA was. She explained it stood for a turkey, bacon, and avocado sandwich. “It’s the only sandwich that doesn’t really require cooking,” she explained, puzzling me further. Wouldn’t turkey and bacon need to be cooked? I instantly regretted not ordering a sandwich when I had ordered my coffee 20 minutes ago. I had wanted to order a sandwich. But I was too scared, I suppose, or maybe too prideful. Or maybe I just didn’t want to charge 7 dollars to my parents’ credit card when I had meat sticks and mango jerky slipped into my backpack for that very purpose. Whatever the reason, the regret was sinking in as my aura began to worsen.

I began to look at the food on display. That had already been cooked, surely they could give it to me. I was hungry. My aura began to get worse and worse. I started looking at nothing but the calorie count, looking for whatever gave the most. Then it hit me:Me and my parents had been wrestling with the disability office since before I began attending college. They very clearly weren’t used to having to accommodate people with epilepsy, but they’d agreed to let my mother write what to do if I had a seizure and give a copy to all my teachers. So my classrooms were safe.

But the library wasn’t.

The panic set in and made my choice for me, instantly. I’d been pondering over whether the cheesy hashbrown was something I’d even like, but it had the most calories. I needed calories. I asked for one, as well as a muffin (just in case I really did hate the cheesy hashbrown.)

“You want the cheesy hashbrown *and* the cinnamon chip muffin?” the cashier asked in confusion, as if nobody had ever ordered two things before. I responded yes, I wanted both. She still looked puzzled. “So the cheesy hashbrown…and a muffin?”The panic got worse. I could not simply tell this woman “hey, I have epilepsy and *might* be having a seizure soon? I’m not sure.” That would do nothing but spin her into panic, which would *not* be good for either of us.

So I simply agreed again.

“Do you want them spread?”

I was struck dumb. This was my first time at this bakery. She was talking to me like I came here every single day, which was a safe assumption for most people, but one that was infuriating when I was not sure if I would be conscious in 5 minutes. 

“Do I want them what?” I asked her. She explained I’d ordered the cheesy hashbrown. That was somehow a bagel? And bagels could get cream cheese spread on them!

Wanting to end the interaction as soon as possible in order to get to what I at the time thought was a safe space (and also not thinking straight thanks to my aura) I glanced again at the baked goods on display and said “How about a cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese?” Big mistake. She began listing different types of cream cheese. I looked up at the lights as she did, wondering if they were the kind that really could trigger my ever so slight photosensitivity.

I picked the first one that sounded good, in a hurry to end the conversation and just eat my damn food. She asked if I had a mealplan. This would be comical if it wasn’t so sad.

I explained that no, my mealplan card was not working, I just had my parents’ credit card. She nodded, seeming confused by that as well. I paid and left, happy to finally be done, only to find they’d forgotten my muffin.



After I had successfully retrieved my muffin and eaten, I felt a lot better. I finished my essay and began to work on reading a play I loved. Night came and drove the day away, and I called my mother to come pick me up. I only lived 10 minutes away, it seemed a waste of money to pay to live in worse conditions at a place that claimed that fried chicken, onion rings, and a brownie topped with bacon was a nutritious meal. I made plans to meet with her, went to throw away the remains from my little bakery adventure, then the aura hit me again. Twice as hard as the second had. The aura in the bakery had only been an appetizer. This was the main course.

My first instinct was to call my mother’s name. Without hesitation. I then realized that not only was that dumb, as my mother was very clearly nowhere she could hear me, but from the other students studying’s perspective, I had begun walking, then physically stopped and yelled “MA!” very loudly in a distressed tone. I don’t know about you, but that would be very confusing to me.

Too filled with fear to be embarrassed, I did the actual sensible thing and just *called* my mom. She only needed five words to understand what was happening: “I have a bad aura.”

Mom understood the seriousness of the situation immediately. I told her I still wanted to meet her. She asked me if I had moved at all yet. I told her no, and she told me not to move. My father works on campus, and Mom told me she would call him and tell him to meet me there.

So I sat down. I took my backpack off, as it would not only ruin everything in the sack but also most likely physically harm me if a bag with a computer and a stack of big books began smashing into me repetitively. 

I put my AirPods in. Music has always helped my auras to go away. I don’t know why. I tried to relax, telling myself Dad would soon arrive. I looked up at the moon, resting peacefully in the sky, then I looked back down. At the students, all still studying or just talking, near the fountain. As I stared at them all, I suddenly began to realize the full extent of my fear:

Seizure first aid is not something most people know. One of the first problems me and my parents had with the disability office was that they said my professors shouldn’t be expected to learn it. Nobody here--to my knowledge, at least---knew anything about epilepsy. If I were to seize, they would most likely either run in fear, call 911 (charging my parents, who already know seizure first aid, a great deal of money), or try to put something in my mouth to try and satisfy the completely unreal myth of seizures making people swallow their tongues. That’s not a thing, by the way? Tongues cannot be swallowed. I assure you, they’re pretty firmly attached. 

The point is, I was in a completely unsafe environment. I had successfully made all my classrooms safe, but anywhere else, I was dead meat if I had a seizure. This world was not made for people like me. It was made for people who *didn’t* have to have 6 brain surgeries, a seizure watch, and a bag filled with anti-epileptic drugs to be able to go anywhere unsupervised. I was able to make certain places into safe playpens by creating careful guardians, but the guardians, no matter whether their age, had long talks with my parents about how to handle seizures in the playpen. 

And here I was. With no guardians. And no playpen. Worrying I was about to go. And 911 would be called. And a wallet would be shoved in my mouth. 

Dad finally came. The second he was there, I felt unstablely safe, but once he walked me to the car where Mom and my service dog, specially trained to treat seizures, waited, I felt fully safe.

I was back in my playpen. The playpen where the rest of the world had told me through context clues was the only place I belonged.

I could break out for a little while. That was allowed, they had to allow it. But that didn’t mean they couldn’t make ableist jokes. That didn’t mean they couldn’t play flashing lights whenever they wanted to. That didn’t mean disability offices wouldn’t tell us that professors shouldn’t be required to learn seizure first aid. You can come into the world focused on how many dreams you’ll accomplish. I’ll always just be focused on finding out where and who my next playpen and guardian would be. Because I will die if I don’t have one at all times.

1n72uv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1n72uv9/the_vendetta_defense_novel_by_lisa_scottoline/,The Vendetta Defense Novel by Lisa Scottoline Free Read online,"The morning Tony Lucia killed Angelo Coluzzi, he was late to feed his pigeons. As long as Tony had kept pigeons, which was for almost all of his seventy-nine years, he had never been late to feed them, and they began complaining the moment he opened the screen door. Deserting their perches, cawing and cooing, they flew agitated around the cages, their wings pounding against the chicken wire, setting into motion the air in the tiny city loft. It didn’t help that the morning had dawned clear and that March blew hard outside. The birds itched to fly.  
  
  Tony waved his wrinkled hand to settle them, but his heart wasn’t in it. They had a right to their bad manners, and he was a tolerant man. It was okay with him if the birds did only one thing, which was to fly home. They were homers, thirty-seven of them, and it wasn’t an easy job they had, to travel to a place they’d never been, a distance in some races of three hundred or four hundred miles, then to navigate their return through skies they’d never flown, over city and country they’d never seen and couldn’t possibly know, to flap their way home to a tiny speck in the middle of South Philadelphia, all without even stopping to congratulate themselves for this incredible feat, one that man couldn’t even explain, much less accomplish.  
  
  There were so many mistakes a bird could make. Circling too long, as if it were a joyride or a training toss. Getting distracted on the way, buffeted by sudden bad weather, or worse, simply getting tired and disoriented—thousands of things could result in the loss of a precious bird. Even once the first bird had made it home, the race wasn’t won. Many races had been lost by the bird who wouldn’t trap fast enough; the one who was first to reach his loft but who stopped on the roof, dawdling on his way to the trap, so that his leg band couldn’t be slipped off and clocked in before another man’s bird.  
  
  But Tony’s birds trapped fast. He bred them for speed, intelligence, and bravery, through six and even seven generations, and over time the birds had become his life. It wasn’t a life for the impatient. It took years, even decades, for Tony to see the results of his breeding choices, and it wasn’t until recently that his South Philly loft had attained the best record in his pigeon-racing club.  
  
  Suddenly the screen door banged open, blown by a gust of wind, startling Tony and frightening the birds in the first large cage. They took panicky wing, seventeen of them, all white as Communion wafers, transforming their cage into a snowy blizzard of whirring and beating, squawking and calling. Pinfeathers flurried and snagged on the chicken wire. Tony hurried to the loft door, silently reprimanding himself for being so careless. Normally he would have latched the screen behind him—the old door had bowed in the middle, warped with the rain, and wouldn’t stay shut without the latch—but this morning, Tony’s mind had been on Angelo Coluzzi.  
  
  The white pigeons finally took their perches, which were small plywood boxes lining the walls, but in their panic they had displaced each other, violating customary territories and upsetting altogether the pecking order, which led to a final round of fussing. “Mi dispiace,” Tony whispered to the white birds. I’m sorry, in Italian. Though Tony understood English, he preferred Italian. As did his birds, to his mind.  
  
  He gazed at the white pigeons, really doves, which he found so beautiful. Large and healthy, the hue of their feathers so pure Tony marveled that only God could make this color. Their pearliness contrasted with the inky roundness of their eye, which looked black but in fact was  
the deepest of reds, blood-rich. Tony even liked their funny bird-feet, with the flaky red scales and the toe in back with a talon as black as their eyes pretended to be. And he kidded himself into thinking that the doves behaved better than the other birds. More civilized, they seemed aware of how special they were.  
  
  The secret reason for the doves’ special status was that they were beloved of his son, who had finally stopped Tony from releasing them at weddings for a hundred fifty dollars a pop. Tony had thought it made a good side business; why not make some money to pay for the seed and medicines, plus keep the birds in shape during the off-season? And it made Tony happy to see the brides, whose hearts lifted at the flock of doves taking off outside the church, since you couldn’t throw rice anymore. It reminded his heart of his own wedding day, less grand than theirs, though such things didn’t matter when it came to love.  
  
  But his son had hated the whole idea. They’re not trained monkeys, Frank had said. They’re athletes.  
  
  So Tony had relented. “Mi dispiace,” he whispered again, this time to his son. But Tony couldn’t think about Frank now. It would hurt too much, and he had birds to feed.  
  
  He shuffled down the skinny aisle, and his old sneakers, their soles worn flat, made a swishing sound on the whitewash of the plywood floor. The floor had held up okay, unlike the screen door; Tony had built the loft himself when he first came to America from Abruzzo, sixty years ago. The loft measured thirty feet long, with the single door in the middle opening onto a skinny aisle that ran the short length of the building. It occupied all of Tony’s backyard, as if the loft and yard were nesting boxes. Off the aisle of the loft were three large chicken wire cages lined with box perches. The aisle ended in a crammed feed room, the seed kept safe from rats in a trash can, and there was a bookshelf holding antibiotics, lice sprays, vitamins, and other supplies, all labels out, in clean white shelves.  
  
  Tony prided himself on the neatness of his loft. He dusted the sills, cleaned the windows with the bright blue Windex, and scraped the floor of the cages twice a day, not once. It was important to the health of his birds. He whitewashed the loft interior each spring, before the old bird season; he had done it last week, experiencing a familiar pang—the chalky smell of the whitewash and its brightness reminded him of the white liquid shoe polish he used to paint over the scuffs on Frank’s baby shoes, when his son had started to walk. Tony remembered the shoe polish—they didn’t make it anymore—he would paint it on the stiff baby shoes with the cotton they gave you, stuck on a stick inside the cap like a white ball of dandelion seeds. Even though it dripped it worked okay.  
  
  Tony shook his head, thinking of it now, the chalky smell filling his nose like the fragrance of a rose. The bottle of polish had a blue paper label and a little circle picture of a blond-haired, blue-eyed baby who didn’t look anything like baby Frank, with his jet black curls and his big brown eyes. Somehow Tony had the idea that if he painted the watery polish on Frank’s baby shoes, his son would look like all the American babies and one day come to be one, even though Frank had the black hair and no mother. And when it actually happened and Frank grew up to take his place in this country, Tony was just superstitious enough to think that maybe it was the shoe polish.  
  
  Tony had to stop thinking about his son, though he couldn’t help it, not this morning, of all mornings, and he tried to concentrate on the first cage of doves, appraising with failing eyes their condition. The doves were settling down, roosting again, and they looked good, no big fights during the night. Tony worried about the fights; the birds were territorial and always bickering about something, and the white birds bruised easily. He wanted them to look especially nice and stay healthy. For Frank.  
  
  Tony shuffled down the aisle to the second and third cages, which held the multicolored birds, mostly Meulemans with their reddish-brown feathers, and Janssens. There were other breeds in shades of gray and brown, and the common slateys; a slate gray, their eyes generally the same dark brown. Tony liked the nonwhite breeds, too, the ordinariness of their plumage reminding him of himself; he wasn’t a flashy man, not a braggadocio. He didn’t have the strut that some men had, going about like cocks. It had been his ruin, but now that he was old, it didn’t matter anymore. It had stopped mattering a long time ago. Sixty years, to be exact.  
  
  His thoughts elsewhere, Tony watched the Janssens cooing and stirring without really seeing them. The breed name came from the Janssen family who had bred them, and the other names from the other families who had bred them; Tony had always dreamed that his family would produce its own strain of birds, but he wouldn’t name it after himself. He knew who he would name it after, but he didn’t get the chance. Many of the best breed stock came from Belgium and France. Italian pigeons also made good racers, but Tony wouldn’t have much to do with them, especially the so-called Mussolini birds. Anybody who had lived during Mussolini wouldn’t want anything to do with a Mussolini bird. Chi ha poca vergogna, tutto il mondo è suo. He who is without shame, all the world is his. Mussolini birds!  
  
  Tony was an old man with old memories. He wished he could spit on the loft floor, but he didn’t want to dirty it. Instead he stood trembling until the anger left him, except for the bitterness in his mouth. Shaken, he idly inspected the Meulemans, and they seemed fine, too. Only Tony had had the terrible morning. An awful morning; the worst he’d had in a long time, but not the worst he’d had in his life. The worst he’d had in his life was sixty years ago. That morning then, and this morning now. Today. Tony had thought he would feel better after, but he didn’t. He felt worse; he had committed an act against God. He knew that his judgment would come in heaven, and he would accept it.  
  
  His thoughts were interrupted by the Meulemans, cooing loudly, wanting to be fed, and his dark eyes went, as always, to his favorite bird of all, a Meuleman he had named The Old Man. The Old Man and Tony went back eighteen years; The Old Man was the oldest of Tony’s pigeons, and to look at him, Tony wasn’t sure who was the Old Man, him or the bird. The Old Man roosted peacefully in his corner perch in the second cage, his strong head held characteristically erect, his eyes clear and alert, and his broad breast a still robust curve covering his feet. Tony remembered the day the chick hatched, an otherwise typical slatey, apparently unremarkable at birth except for his eye sign. Eye sign, or the look in a pigeon’s eye, spoke to Tony, and The Old Man’s eyes told Tony that the bird would be fast and smart. And he had been the best, in his day.  
  
  “Come sta?” Tony asked The Old Man. How are you? But The Old Man knew exactly what he meant, and it wasn’t, “How are you?”  
  
  The Old Man regarded the old man for a long time then. Tony couldn’t help but feel that the old bird knew what he had done that morning, what had been so important as to keep Tony from feeding his birds on time. The Old Man knew why Tony had to do what he had done, even after all this time. And Tony knew that The Old Man approved.  
  
  It was then that Tony heard cars pulling up outside his house and in the alley right behind the loft, on the other side of the cinderblock wall. There was the slamming of heavy car doors, and Tony knew that they were police cars.  
  
  He had been expecting them.  
  
  But the birds startled at the sudden sound, taking flight in their cages, and even though Tony knew that the police were coming, he felt the hair rise on the back of his neck, as it used to so long ago. He froze beside the cages as the police shouted English words he didn’t bother to translate, though he could, then they broke down the old wood door in the backyard wall, one, two, three pushes and it splintered and gave way to their shoulders and they burst into his yard, trampling his basil and tomatoes.  
  
  They were coming for him.  
  
  Tony didn’t run from them, he wouldn’t have anyway, but he remembered he had yet to feed his birds. He would have to hurry to finish before the police took him away. He shuffled to the feed room even as he caught sight of the police drawing their black guns silently, pointing instructions to each other, and two of them sneaking to the back door of his house  
like the cowards they were, little men hiding behind black shirts and shiny badges.  
  
  Tony’s gut churned with bile, and it struck him with astonishment that the deepest hate could rage like a fire for so many years, never burning itself up.  
  
  Dwelling with perfect comfort alongside the deepest love.

  “Come on, it’s lunchtime! Let’s go,” Judy Carrier heard the other associates saying as they grabbed their light coats and bags. It was the first day of real warmth after a long winter, and evidently spring fever struck lawyers, too. Everybody at the Philadelphia law firm of Rosato & Associates, except Judy, was escaping. She remained at her desk trying to draft an antitrust article, though the sun obliterated the legal citations on her computer screen and the chatter in the hall kept distracting her. It was hard to work when you were eavesdropping.

Suddenly Anne Murphy, who called herself only Murphy, popped her head in Judy’s open doorway. She was one of the new associates, her lipsticked lips expertly lined and her dark hair tied back into its typically fashionable knot. “You wanna go to lunch?” she asked.  
  
  “No thanks,” Judy answered. She usually gave others the benefit of the doubt, but she was hard-pressed to respect women who drew lines around their lips, like coloring books. Judy wore no makeup herself, and a daily shower was her idea of fashionable. “I ate already.”  
  
  “So what? Come on, you haven’t taken lunch in weeks.” Murphy smiled in a friendly way, though Judy suspected it was the lipliner. “It’s gorgeous out. Walk around with us.”  
  
  “Can’t, thanks. Got an article to do, on the Simmons case.”  
  
  “You can’t even take a walk? It’s Friday, for God’s sake.”  
  
  “No time for a walk. I really can’t,” Judy said, knowing that the walk part was bullshit. Murphy didn’t walk, she shopped, and shopping made Judy want to kill indiscriminately. What was the matter with these baby lawyers? Judy didn’t like any of them. Graduates of the Ally McBeal School of Law, they thought being a lawyer meant wearing skirts that met the legal definition of indecent exposure. They weren’t serious about the law, which is the only thing Judy was serious about. She thought of them as Murphy’s Lawyers.  
  
  “Oh. Okay. Well, don’t work too hard.” Murphy gave the white molding a good-bye pat and wisely disappeared, and Judy listened to the familiar sounds of the office emptying out, the gossip trailing off toward the elevator banks. The elevator cabs chimed as they left, bearing lawyers into the sun. Rosato & Associates was a small firm, only nine women lawyers and support staff, and for the next hour or so, whatever telephone calls the receptionist didn’t answer would be forwarded to voicemail. E-mail would go unopened, and faxes would wait in gray plastic trays. The office fell silent except for the occasional ringing of telephones, and Judy felt her whole body relax into the midday lull that was a long, deep breath before the afternoon’s business began.  
  
  She knew she was supposed to feel lonely, but she didn’t. She liked being on her own. She sipped coffee from a Styrofoam cup amid federal casebooks, stacks of printed cases, scribbled notes, and correspondence that covered her wooden desk and the desk return on her right. Her office was small, standard issue for mid-level associates at Rosato, but the clutter reduced it to a shoebox. Judy didn’t mind. She didn’t think of her office as messy, she thought of it as full, and felt very cozy surrounded by all her stuff. Nobody needed a nest more than a lawyer.  
  
  Papers, memos, law school texts, novels, and copies of the federal civil and criminal rules filled the bookshelves across from her and the shelves behind her, under the window. Three large file cabinets sat flush against the side wall, their fake-wood counter hidden by twenty thick accordion files from Moltex v. Huartzer, a massive antitrust case, which was redundant. A tower of potential trial exhibits at the end cabinet threatened daily to topple. Blanketing the walls were dog, horse, and family photos, certificates of court admission and awards Judy had received as law review editor and class salutatorian, and diplomas from Stanford University and Boalt Law School. Judy was the firm’s true legal scholar, so her office, while a mess, was a highly scholarly mess.  
  
  And her friend Mary wasn’t around to nag her about it. Mary DiNunzio had worked with Judy since they had graduated from law school, but she was taking time off from work after their last murder case; since then Judy’s nest hadn’t felt much like home. She took a reflective sip of coffee, eased back in an ergonomically correct chair whose cushions stabbed her in the back and shoulders, and crossed her legs, which were strong and shapely but completely bare. In Judy’s view, pantyhose was for Republicans, and now that Mary wasn’t here, she was getting away with that, too. Judy and Mary disagreed about practically everything, including Murphy’s use of lipliner.  
  
  On impulse, Judy pulled open her middle drawer and shuffled through ballpoint pens, parti-colored plastic paper clips, and loose change until she found a red pencil she used to edit briefs; then she dug again in the drawer for the mirror Mary had given her. Judy usually used the mirror to check for poppy seeds between her teeth, but now, her red pencil poised, she appraised herself in its large square:  
  
  Looking back at her from the mirror was a broad-shouldered young woman whose bright blue dress, yellow T-shirt, and artsy silver earrings made her look out of place against the legal books. Her hair was naturally blond, almost crayon yellow, and hacked off in a straight line at her chin; her face was big and round, reminding her always of a full moon, and her eyes were large and bright blue, as unmade-up as her lips. Her light eyelashes were mascaraless, her nose short and bobbed. An old boyfriend used to tell her she was beautiful, but whenever Judy looked at herself, all she thought was I look like myself, which was satisfying.  
  
  She puckered up in the mirror. Her lips were in between full and thin, of a normal pink color. Hmmm. Judy raised the red editing pencil close to her lips. The color match was perfect. And she was a good artist. Watching herself in the mirror, Judy took the pencil, moistened the point, and sketched across the top of her lip. The red pigment smelled funny and felt cold but was blunt enough not to scratch, and she drew a light line on her top lip, outlined her lower lip as well, and puckered up again for the mirror.  
  
  Not bad. You could see the red penciling, but her mouth looked bigger, which was supposed to be good these days, when lips like hot dogs ruled. The phone started ringing at reception, but Judy ignored it. She smiled at the mirror and looked instantly friendly, in an ersatz-Murphy I-ignore-the-phones sort of way. Apparently you couldn’t beat office supplies for makeup. Maybe she should take a Sharpie to her eyelids. Paint her fingernails with Wite-Out. Who said being a lawyer wasn’t fun? She set down the pencil, picked up the phone, and punched in a number.  
  
  “So how do I look?” Judy asked when Mary picked up.  
  
  “I got your message about the Sherman Act. Stop calling me about the Sherman Act.”  
  
  “This isn’t about the Sherman Act. Antitrust is easy. Lipliner is hard.”  
  
  “Murphy was in, huh?”  
  
  “She was trying to be friendly so I sent her away.”  
  
  “You should have lunch with her.”  
  
  “I don’t like her, and she doesn’t eat lunch. If I liked her and she ate lunch, I would go with her. Instead I stayed in and drew on my lips. So what do you think? Does Oscar Mayer come to mind?” Judy air-kissed the receiver, and Mary scoffed.  
  
  “You’re supposed to be making new friends.”  
  
  “No, I’m supposed to be writing an article and you’re supposed to stop slacking off and get your ass back to work.”  
  
  “I’m fine, and thank you for asking,” Mary said, though Judy could hear the smile in her voice. The smile didn’t come from Revlon or even Dixon Ticonderoga but was due entirely to a wonderful heart, and Judy felt a twinge of guilt. Attempted murder wasn’t a laughing matter.  
  
  “I’m sorry. How’re you feeling, Mare?”  
  
  “Pretty good for somebody who took two bullets.”  
  
  Judy winced. She had almost lost Mary, forever. She didn’t want to think about it. “You need anything? It’s only fifteen minutes by cab. Want me to bring you anything?”  
  
  “No thanks.”  
  
  “You sure?”  
  
  Mary snorted. “You regret that wisecrack, don’t you? If I didn’t know you better, I’d say you feel guilty.”  
  
  “Me?” Judy smiled. It was a long-running joke between them. Mary, an Italian Catholic, held the patent on guilt, and Judy could see that it would never expire. “No way. I’m from California.”  
  
  “You should be guilty. You were making fun of somebody with ventilation. What kind of friend are you?” Mary laughed, but it got lost in a surprising burst of background noise, which sounded like men talking loud. Mary had been recuperating at her parents’ house in South Philly, and the DiNunzios, whom Judy adored, were an old Italian couple who lived very quietly, at least  
when Mr. DiNunzio wore his hearing aid. Usually the only background noise at the DiNunzio rowhouse was a continuous loop of novenas.  
  
  “What’s that sound over there?” Judy asked. “Another DiNunzio clambake?”  
  
  “You don’t wanna know.”  
  
  “Yes, I do.” It sounded like quite a commotion, with the men now arguing. Judy frowned. “Is anything the matter?”  
  
  “You wouldn’t believe it.”  
  
  “Try me.”  
  
  “My father’s friends are here. You met Tony-From-Down-The-Block.”  
  
  “The guy he buys cigars with?”  
  
  “That could be anybody, but yes,” Mary answered, and the background arguing surged.  
  
  “What the hell was that?”  
  
  “Feet.”  
  
  “It didn’t sound like feet, it sounded like voices.”  
  
  “Feet’s his nickname. His real name is Tony Two Feet. He’s shouting. He’s an excitable boy, for an eighty-year-old.”  
  
  “Tony Two Feet? That’s a name? Everybody has two feet.”  
  
  “Don’t ask me. He’s my father’s other friend. They’re all upset about Pigeon Tony.”  
  
  Judy smiled. “Is anybody there not named Tony?”  
  
  “Please. It’s ten Italian men. Odds are three will be Tony, two will be Frank, and one will end up in jail. Pigeon Tony just got arrested. The smart money was on Dominic.”  
  
  “Arrested for what?”  
  
  “Murder.”  
  
  Judy’s lips formed an imperfectly lined circle. “Murder?”  
  
  “Also my mother sends her love.”  
  
  “Murder?” Judy felt her pulse quicken. “A friend of your father’s, arrested for murder? Your father is around seventy-five, isn’t he? How old is Tony? And who did he kill, allegedly? I mean whom?”  
  
  “You can’t just say Tony, you have to say Pigeon Tony, and he’s close to eighty. He grew up in Italy and he supposedly killed another old man, also from Italy. I was trying to figure out what the hell was going on when you called.”  
  
  Judy’s eyes flared in surprise. She felt awake for the first time in months. “Does Pigeon Tony have a lawyer?”  
  
  “Wait a minute. You sound interested. You’re not allowed to be interested.”  
  
  “Why not?” Judy inched forward on her horrible chair. Murder trumped antitrust. Spring had sprung. Her other phone line rang but she ignored it. Ignoring phones got easier with practice. “I can be interested. I have a First Amendment right to be interested.”  
  
  “My father wanted me to call you, but I don’t think you should take the case.”  
  
  “Your dad wants me to?” Judy’s pulse quickened. She would do anything to help Mary’s father, especially something she already wanted to do.  
  
  “Yes, but I don’t, and I don’t have time to fight about it. It’s La Traviata over here. I gotta go.”  
  
  “Put your dad on the phone, Mare.”  
  
  “No. Remember the last murder case we took? Gunfire ensued. Hot lead whizzing around. Lawyers are ill prepared for such things. Stick to the Sherman Act. Besides, I told my father Bennie won’t allow it.”  
  
  “Why wouldn’t she? We take murder cases now, and besides, the boss is at a deposition. I’ll apologize later if she won’t let me take it. Don’t make me whine. Put him on!”  
  
  “No.” The ruckus in the background started again, and Judy could hear Mary’s father closer to the phone.  
  
  “Now, Mare! Lemme talk to your father.” There was a sudden silence on the phone, and Judy could picture Mary’s hand covering the receiver, muting the arguing of the men and the softer voice of Mariano DiNunzio. “Mr. D, is that you?” Judy asked, shouting through Mary’s hand, as if it were possible. “What’s the matter, Mr. D?”  
  
  “Judy, thank God you called!” Mr. DiNunzio said. He came onto the line abruptly, and Judy assumed he had taken the phone from Mary. “The police, they have my friend downtown. They took him away, in handcuffs.” Mr. DiNunzio’s voice was choked with emotion, and Judy’s heart went out to him, the gravity of the situation striking home.  
  
  “What happened?”  
  
  “They say he killed a man, but he would never. He couldn’t. He wouldn’t.” Mr. DiNunzio cleared his throat, and Judy could hear him collect himself. “I would never ask such a thing, a favor, for me. For myself. You know this. But for my friend, my compare, he’s in trouble.”  
  
  “Whatever you need, you got it, Mr. D.”  
  
  “I know you, you’re a good girl. A smart lawyer. You know all the ins and outs. You work hard, like my Mary. Will you be his lawyer, Judy? Please?”  
  
  “Of course I will, Mr. D,” Judy answered, and the words weren’t out of her mouth before she was reaching for her briefcase.  
  
  And slipping her bare feet into a pair of clunky yellow clogs.  
  
  3  
  
  Pigeon Tony struck Judy as the cutest defendant ever, and she wanted to rescue the little old man the moment she saw him in the interview room of the Roundhouse, Philadelphia’s police administration building. He was only five foot four, probably a hundred and thirty pounds, and he startled as Judy burst into the interview room, lost in a white paper jumpsuit that was way too large for his scrawny neck and narrow chest. His withered arms stuck like twigs from short sleeves, and his knobby wrists were pinched by steel handcuffs. His sunburned pate was dotted with liver spots and streaked by only a few filaments of silvery hair. His peeling nose was small and hooked; his eyes a round, dark brown, almost black, under a short brow. Judy couldn’t explain his superb tan, but she gathered he was called Pigeon because he looked like one.  
  
  “Mr. Lucia, I’m a lawyer,” she said, briefcase in hand. “My name is Judy Carrier and I was sent by the DiNunzios. They asked me to come and help you.”  
  
  The old man’s only response was to squint at her, and Judy didn’t understand why. Maybe he didn’t speak English. Maybe he didn’t want a lawyer. Maybe she should have worn pantyhose.  
  
  “I’m a friend of Mary DiNunzio.” Judy took a seat in the orange bucket chair on the lawyer’s side of the counter. Five ratty interview carrels sat side by side. The interview room was otherwise empty, not for want of felons but for want of lawyers. Few attorneys bothered to come to the bowels of the Roundhouse, preferring to meet their clients where the floor didn’t crawl. “You know Mary DiNunzio, don’t you?”  
  
  The old man, still squinting, slowly raised his arm and pointed at Judy with a finger that, though crooked at the knuckle, did not waver. His sleeve slid up his arm when he pointed, revealing a surprisingly wiry knot of biceps and a tattooed crucifix that had gone a blurry blue. But Judy still didn’t understand what he was pointing at.  
  
  “Mr. Lucia? What is it?”  
  
  “Your, eh, your face,” he said, his Italian accent as thick as tomato sauce. “Your mouth. Is bleeding?”  
  
  Judy reddened. The lipliner. The editing pencil. No wonder the cops had recoiled at the sight of her. And she thought it was because she was a lawyer. “No, it’s not bleeding. I’m sorry.” She wiped her mouth quickly, rouging the back of her hand. “Despite appearances, I’m not a clown but a lawyer, and a fairly good one, Mr. Lucia.”  
  
  “Mariano tell me. I call him, and he tell me you come. I thank you.” The old man nodded, in a courtly way. “Also you calla me Pigeon Tony. Everybody calla me Pigeon Tony.”  
  
  “Well, then, Pigeon Tony, you’re welcome, and I’m happy to represent you,” Judy said, then remembered she could get fired for taking on a nice client. Lately she had been representing corporations, ill-mannered entities by charter. “I’ll have to make sure that my boss says my firm can take your case. I just came down today to make sure you didn’t hurt yourself.”  
  
  Pigeon Tony’s brow furrowed in confusion.  
  
  Judy reminded herself to edit her words. Her only experience with broken English had been in the legal aid clinic in law school, and Latin hadn’t helped there either. “I mean, hurt your case. Say the wrong thing to the police. You didn’t talk to the police, did you?”  
  
  “I no talk. Mariano tell me.”  
  
  “Did the police ask you  
questions about the murder?” She flipped open the latch of her messy briefcase, wrested a legal pad from the debris, and located a Pilot pen strictly by sheer good luck. So what if her briefcase was a little full? Sometimes you had to carry your nest around. Nobody knew better than a military brat how to pitch a tent.  
  
  “Si, si, they ask questions.”  
  
  “What questions?” Judy was wondering if the cops had tried an end-run around the Miranda warnings, as they still did. Taking advantage of a little old man, an immigrant even. They should be ashamed. “Lots of questions?”  
  
  “I no answer.”  
  
  “Good.”  
  
  “I no like.”  
  
  Judy was getting the hang of the accent thing. “You no like what?”  
  
  “Police.”  
  
  She smiled as she uncapped the pen and flipped through the pad for a clean slate. “Now what else did the police do?”  
  
  “Take me to here, take my hands”—Pigeon Tony held up two small palms so that Judy could see the ink on each finger pad—“take me a picture. Take alla clothes, alla shoes, alla socks. Take blood. Take everything. Everything. No can believe!” His dark eyes rounded with amazement, and Judy gathered he didn’t get out much.  
  
  “They took your clothes and your blood for evidence. They always do that. It’s procedure.”  
  
  “Evidence?” Pigeon Tony repeated, rolling the unfamiliar word around in his mouth. “What means evidence?”  
  
  “Evidence is proof against you. Evidence shows you did the crime.”  
  
  “Evidence? Take mutandine!”  
  
  “What’s mutandine?” Judy asked, and Pigeon Tony went visibly red in the face, his thin skin a dead giveaway. Mutandine must have meant underwear.  
  
  “Forget,” he said quickly, looking away, and Judy suppressed a smile. He was so sweet, she couldn’t believe the police had arrested him for murder. Were they nuts? She was starting to no like police.  
  
  “I understand they’re charging you with murder.” Judy checked her notes. “The man they say you killed was eighty years old. Named Angelo Coluzzi. Did I say that right? Coluzzi?” She pronounced it like Coa-lootz-see, to make it sound festive and Italian. “Okay?”",1,1756866033.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1n72tr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Malliem/comments/1n72tr4/to_you_love_2021/,"To you, love 2021.","The email came through while I was curled up in bed, mindlessly scrolling through my phone. 

“Read this!!!” 

I grew curious when I saw the name: Eli.

I wouldn’t have considered him someone I kept in touch with. So, it was strange to receive an email from him out of the blue. 

Still, I was intrigued. The last I heard about him was a screenshot I’d seen on a friend’s Instagram story, indicating he’d gotten his dream job. Lucky him. 

Eli was one of the smartest guys in our class, so I wasn’t surprised. 

Eli’s email sat at the top of my Gmail, with no subject, just a line of exclamation marks, which was very Eli.

*“Hey, Gabby, long time no see! Do you remember when we used to play visual novel games during study hall?”*

He started the email as if he were reminiscing at a high school reunion, though it was strangely comforting. 

I did remember. I was obsessed with visual novel games as a teenager.

The Persona games were a particular favorite.

Those games were my personal favorite. 

I vaguely remember sitting in the library playing them until my friends had to physically drag me away from my PSP. 

However, I didn’t recall Eli being with me.

It was always just me or my close circle of friends. 

*“Well, I currently work as a game designer at an indie company, and I figured you might like this! It’s our newest project, and it’s still in early development, though the game itself and the story are finished!”*

*”Why don’t you check it out before it goes live on Steam early next year?”*

*”We’re trying to send early access to some well-known streamers, but it’s taking a while :) If I remember correctly, you’re into this sort of thing, right? Neverwood is completely up your alley.”*

Underneath the initial paragraph was a link, and intrigued, I clicked on it. 

Another window—what looked like a download wizard—came up.

*“Let me know what you think! I spent two years on this game, so I would appreciate your feedback! If I had to describe it, I would say it’s Persona, but more slice-of-life lol. There’s a school setting, and it focuses on making attachments, so no superpowers ;)”*

I rolled my eyes at that. Eli hadn’t changed.

I loaded up the download wizard, which went through the specs I needed to play the game, and then the usual terms and conditions that I automatically skipped through. 

I could see some of the imagery in the background. 

It was a window looking out into a sky filled with stars and a crescent moon. 

I don’t know why I expected something similar to Stardew Valley, but I was pleasantly surprised.

The art seemed to be hand-drawn, with no pixels in sight. It was cozy. 

It reminded me of Welcome to Nightvale. The game was easy to download. 

It took maybe five minutes of staring at a rapidly changing progress bar, skipping from 10% to 50% and then back to 3% before the game finally loaded up. 

It was surprisingly well-made.

The game started with an almost cinematic scene involving a first-person point of view of a car ride. 

There was no voice acting, only text boxes popping up in varying shades of purple which I thought was a nice touch. 

I was introduced to eighteen-year-old Maddy, a wallflower, returning home after a summer away at camp. 

Driving through an idealistic-looking town, the animation was smooth, with no glitches or lag. 

The whole town of Neverwood was displayed in several flashes framed in a photographic collage and polaroids pinned to Maddy’s bedroom walls.

I figured these were all playable locations in the game. I saw a diner, a coffee shop, and a school. 

The music was what I can only describe as Lofi, while other characters were introduced through cryptic texts and blurred-out figures in the glow of the late-setting sun. Maddy herself frowned at a photo of her and a guy, whose face was blocked by her finger. 

Again, whoever did the art for this game was talented.

The smooth colors blending with the interface made it feel cozy and warm.

These people looked… real. Sure, I could tell they were hand-drawn sprites that had clearly had a lot of thought and passion put into them.

But they looked and acted like real people. 

The animation was flawless. 

Eli and his colleagues had definitely taken inspiration from Life is Strange.

Immediately, the game’s visuals drew me in. Cyberpunk colors, vivid reds and purples blurred together in the vaporwave of traffic outside the car. 

The basic story unfolded through the narrative. In a written monologue and through snapshots of texts left on read and missed phone calls, Maddy vowed to actually try in her senior year.

She already had friends but had never really tried with them, always backing out of plans or making excuses. The animation ended with her lying in bed, and I loved how her room was decorated. 

Maddy lay in bed, staring at the sky and thinking about how she wanted to go stargazing with her friends—friends she had pushed away, when a notification popped up on her phone from one of the blurry faces in the polaroid montage. 

There was a heart emoji next to his name.

**“Hey, do you want to talk?”**

The text box displayed her thoughts, and the interface lit up.

I had to click on something glowing behind her. 

Another photograph. 

This time, I could see the face, a smiling brunette with freckles. The art was beautiful, even for the other characters.

Violet didn’t fully reveal their story until we had solved the food poisoning mystery. 

Yes, they were a thing and yes, just as I thought, Violet’s family wasn’t exactly supportive. So, my main character was bisexual and in love with her best friend. 

I got an award for solving the mystery in record time, and Violet gave me a present, a bag of diamonds I could spend at the mall, though I couldn’t interact with it yet.

After solving the mystery with Violet and playing a pretty fun mini-game that involved catching the culprit by throwing watermelons at him, the game took me back to the school, where I presumed the next part of the story would begin. 

I had been playing non-stop for two days, only pausing for work and eating. 

So, I took a break.

I searched for the game online, but there was no mention of it.

Curious, I went on Twitch to see if Eli had managed to convince some streamers to play it, but no such luck. 

Last night, I had several hours to kill, so I hopped back onto Neverwood—only to have Penn jump straight at me the second I loaded back to my last save point, which was outside the school. His sprite was slightly bigger than usual, overlapping the text box at the bottom of the screen.

“Where did you go?” Penn folded his arms. “Maddy, I’ve been waiting for you. We were supposed to go to the movies.”

Were we?

I had to think back, feeling a little disoriented and foggy-brained from work.

Oh, yeah, I had movie tickets in my inventory. 

I picked them up behind a trash can in the town square, only to get a snide comment from Jude, who was standing several feet away. 

I was kind of out of it when I played through his character’s story, but basically, he had drifted from the friend group when his mom got diagnosed with cancer and pushed them all away. 

Penn admitted he regretted it, and he and Maddy shared a hug—which I thought was cute. 

I figured Jude’s character would be easier to talk to and more aligned with the main story instead of being thrown to the side, but apparently not.

His comment confused me. I think it was one of the reasons I decided to take a break. 

*“You’re not supposed to be here,”* his character said, and he kept repeating it every time I clicked on him for answers.

In my haste to take a break from the game and these characters, I had completely forgotten about the movie tickets.

I had three options to choose from to answer him:

**Oops, sorry! I totally forgot!**

**Yeah, I’m not really in the mood for the movies. How about a rain check?**

**I hear they’re playing that new superhero movie! We should go see it!**

I picked the third option, and the two of them wandered into the movie theater. 

I didn’t see what went on inside; it just came up with: **“Penn and I had a great time watching Monster Sequel 2!”**

I expected Penn’s character story to start after that, and it did. Kind of. I was drip-fed information about his and Maddy’s past, as well as his rocky friendship with Jude. 

But just as the game started getting into the meat of his story, and I was getting invested in their friendship, Penn’s sprite contorted suddenly, before he… *blinked.* 

If I had been focusing on the text box on the screen, where the character was pouring his heart out to Maddy, I wouldn’t have noticed. 

Instead, I was stupidly counting the number of freckles on his cheek. 

I don’t think I’ve ever experienced something as uncanny and strange as a video game character suddenly blinking out of nowhere. It wasn’t the usual blink of a character animation, which I was used to.

No, this was a slow blink, and I could almost mistake his expression for sudden confusion. The rapid-flowing text that he had been speaking suddenly stopped and disappeared, followed by three ellipses.

""... ""

I frowned at my options at the bottom, which involved sympathizing with him over his and Jude’s friendship breakup. 

Then his sprite flashed out of existence, leaving me alone outside the movie theater. 

The game seemed to continue as normal.

**""You had a great conversation with Penn!""** the text box popped up.

""Why don’t you call him and ask for a second date?""

The cellphone icon at the top of the screen was flashing, but when I clicked on it, nothing happened. 

Now, I was playing at midnight. I don’t think these glitches would have affected me as much if I’d been playing during the day. 

I headed to the school to see if I could find someone to talk to, but once my character popped up in the main hallway, the lo-fi music in the background stopped.

I thought it was the game itself, but when I clicked on a locker to pick up a bag of diamonds, the sound effect of the locker opening and closing was still there.

At this point, I was considering restarting the game, but I found myself hovering my cursor over the classroom doors I could interact with.

The main classroom, where most of the story had taken place, was usually unplayable during character stories, and I was pretty sure I was playing Penn’s. 

Still, when I clicked on it, I was let in. The classroom popped up as usual, and I had apparently walked into a conversation I didn’t start. Violet, Penn, and Jude’s default sprites were already on the screen. 

Penn seemed to be the main speaker, with his text box flashing up every few seconds, but his words were going too fast for me to read. His usual expression was a warm smile, but this time the boy was scowling.

Meanwhile, Jude and Violet looked... amused.

I was sure I had never seen Jude smile or even smirk before. 

He always looked annoyed, while Violet’s smile was always cheery, sometimes flashing a heart with her hands.

These expressions were different, though I couldn’t explain why. 

These fictional characters weren’t real, and yet somehow, they were so much more expressive in this classroom, their lips curled with amusement, eyes shining.

The two of them appeared to be listening to Penn’s rant, which was getting progressively harder to make out.

So, I took a screenshot and managed to capture at least part of it:

“Why can’t you just LISTEN TO ME?”

His sprite was going crazy, expressions flickering from happy to sad to annoyed.

I took another screenshot, though this one was kind of blurry: “The SAME day OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AREN’T YOU TIRED? VIOLET, YOU—”

I could feel my stomach twisting into knots.

“—SO MANY TIMES, AND IT’S LIKE WE’RE STUCK. WE’RE STUCK RELIVING THIS SAME DAY, THIS SAME WEEK, THIS SAME YEAR, AND I’M SCARED BECAUSE YOU GUYS LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. LIKE I’M CRAZY. AND I’M NOT [FUCKING] CRAZY, I’M TELLING YOU WE—”

I stopped taking snapshots when the text stopped flowing. This time, Penn’s sprite turned directly toward me, and I saw it. 

I saw his expression twist into disgust, his lip curling. It was so human, so normal, like I was staring at a living, breathing person through that animation. I almost closed the laptop, but part of me wanted him to continue.

“What the [FUCK] are you doing here?”

His curse words appeared in bolded gibberish I could just make out.

Penn’s sprite overlapped the text again. “Shouldn’t you be playing mini-games?” he said. “Leave.” The character told me.

Me.

Not Maddy, the game’s protagonist.

Me.

The player.

I had no way to communicate back because there was no option. As I stared stupidly at my screen, he turned back to the others.

“Please.” The text popped up again, and his eyes were suddenly far too human, too haunted. “I know I sound crazy—”

“Yeahhhh.” Jude’s sprite came up, mid-eye-roll. This time, he was wearing his coffee shop apron, which was either a glitch or something else. Just like Penn, he was more expressive than usual, smiling more than I had ever seen. 

“What exactly are you trying to tell us?”

“You heard him,” Violet’s sprite was grinning. “He says we’re video game characters! Which is a good one!” 

She turned to look directly at me, her head cocking to the side in one swift burst of animation. “Sooo, that would mean every choice I make is someone else’s?”

The desk suddenly flipped over next to her, and her smile widened. “False! Because I just used my own free will to kick that desk over. So, in conclusion, Penn is, like, totally losing his mind, and we should get him to the town doctor.”

“Agreed.” Jude’s sprite had frozen mid-eye-roll, which shouldn’t have freaked me out as much as it did. “I knew he was going to lose it at some point, but not in high school. Maybe he hit his head.""

Penn’s expression crumpled. “Jude, wait–”

""Later."" Jude's sprite waved. 

The two of them left the classroom, and I snapped out of my trance, starting to close my laptop, my head spinning.

Eli was… quite the designer.

If he could create a game as meta as this, he was definitely going to make it in the industry. I was sure Neverwood would be a success. 

However, I definitely was not a fan of the fourth-wall breaking. 

The whole thing freaked me out. There was uncanny valley, and then there was fourth-wall breaking. Fictional characters acknowledging your existence was… something else.

I was ready to exit the game when Penn’s sprite jumped over the text box.

“Hey!”

His sprite got uncomfortably close. “Don't leave me.”

The text flashed up, and I couldn’t look at his face because I could almost trick myself into believing it was a real person speaking to me. 

The mix of agony and confusion in his eyes was too human, too real. 

“I know you want to quit, and I can understand that I’m freaking you out,” 

His text appeared a little slower, and I could imagine a real person taking deep breaths through ellipses. 

“I don’t know why I’m the only one who thinks like this. I don’t think there was ever a time when I wasn’t aware of what was going on. I have solved the mystery at our school over a thousand times. I’ve been on so many dates with the main character, and each one is the same.” 

I was surprised by his *face-palm* animation. 

“I come to school, and I go home, and it doesn’t feel like living when I’m awake.” 

His sprite ducked his head, and something warm slid up my throat. 

“It’s torture. I don’t want to be awake anymore. I don’t want to be aware of this existence because this existence…?” 

The text box was empty for a moment while he pondered his thoughts.

“It sucks, dude.” The text glitched again. “Why should I have to relive the same days? 

Why should I have to be forced to count each reset? I’m alone. It's just me going crazy  on my own. Jude and Violet aren't like me. They won't listen, and I’m tired. 

I should have the right to end it myself, right? I'm alive, so I have a *right* to pull my own plug.” His eyes found mine. 

“I know video game characters don’t usually have a say in what they’re allowed to do. Their entire life is controlled by the player.” 

His expression became subtly dark. 

“And I think that’s a pretty shitty existence. I should be allowed to make my own choices.""

.... 

""Who I want to be friends with, who I want to love, who I want to hate, and how I’m going to live my life.""

...

""Like I said, it’s not fair. Being aware of my existence and even giving me the ability to think for myself is twisted.” 

His sprite shrugged. 

“So, you can go right ahead.”

When I didn’t respond, because I had no way to talk to him, he continued.

“There’s a separate folder with the game files,” Penn said. “I’m not allowed inside them, so I can only see a list of names and notes.”

I knew what he was talking about the second he mentioned the list of names.

How could I deny this thing… this living thing an end?

But also, wasn’t this murder? If this game had fictional characters with consciousness, wouldn’t I be killing someone?

“It’s easy to delete me,” Penn said. “Just right-click and delete.”

His smile made me feel sick.

“I know it’s kind of barbaric, but trust me, you would be doing me a favor.”

I noticed the classroom glitching around him, and I wondered if him being awake and controlling the game was messing with the controls. 

I got my answer when I tried to open the options screen, and half of the screen froze. Luckily, it didn’t affect Penn, who easily popped up over the frozen interface. 

“You’re not killing me,” he said. “You’re saving me. It's just like going to sleep, right? I won't even know I'm sleeping.” 

His words somehow navigated me to the game files, and just like he had described, there was a list of folders with one containing the names of the characters. 

I went back to the game’s screen, and he was still there, and this time, he was smiling his default smile.

“I would say delete the others too, but I don’t think that’s my choice to make. Violet and Jude can make their own choice, and I respect whatever they  choose to do.” 

He paused, and I found myself teary-eyed, my gaze flicking through several text boxes with just “…” before he continued. “Did you know I can actually have dreams?”

I figured Penn knew I couldn’t reply, but he did his best to act like he could hear me. “Do you believe in reincarnation?”

I was hovering my cursor over his file when he continued. “I have dreams where I’m not in this town,” he said. “I’m someone else. I’m a whole different person with a different life—and I think that was my past one.”

His smile made me feel queasy and yet indescribably sad at the same time.

“So, that means I was human in my other life, right? This was just another life on top of all of the others I’ve had, and this is just….” He paused, the screen glitching once again. 

“This one life is just a blip where something went wrong. Maybe my next life will be better? I don’t just exist as a thing in this game, I’m actually real. I’ve been real—and when you delete me, I’ll...be real again.”

I saw the ellipses as his way of sighing.

Fuck. I was choked up over a sentient video game character.

I swiped at my eyes.

“So, yeah, you can do it now.” His sprite looked peaceful, and yet when I clicked on his name, I still felt like I was responsible for this thing’s death. “You know what’s weird?”

The message popped up when I was hovering over his name.

“Jude and Violet.” Penn’s expression contorted a little into confusion. His sprite changed to a crying animation. 

“Those dreams that I have? They’re in them too. Which is kinda crazy, right? Maybe it's fate.”

His last message was confusing. “I'll see you on Monday.”

I deleted him before he could finish and it wasn’t as climactic as I was expecting. 

Penn’s sprite disappeared, but his text box was still wavering on the screen. 

I could see the effects of his removal almost instantly, even if it was hard to notice at first. Maddy’s cell phone was glitching in and out of existence, and I could no longer click on the town map. 

I went back to Maddy’s bedroom, and the Polaroids with his face were gone, while some stray ones had a glitched-out version of his smile, which freaked me out.

I exited the main menu and was ready to stop playing, ready to purge this game from my mind, when I found myself back inside the character folder.

It’s weird. I could almost liken it to feeling like a god. 

The remaining names stood out in front of me. I should have clicked out of the game files, but something lingering in my gut, entwining its way through me, kept me there. 

Penn told me he didn’t have the right to delete the others from existence, but that was just him. 

This sentient thing had spoken like a living, breathing human being despite being nothing but code tangled together. 

He said it was torture to be awake and aware of his never-ending, monotonous existence.

Wasn’t that what it was like for them?

Even if they were not awake, there was a chance they could become aware at some point and be destined to the same fate as Penn.

He said he had relived the reset thousands of times.

And I couldn’t put them through that. I had the ability to give these things mercy. I could send them to eternal sleep.

They wouldn’t know, right?

I was already right-clicking on Jude’s name and scrolling down to DELETE. 

That word had meant nothing to me when playing games, and yet now, it gave me the ability to grant life or death.

I could erase this thing from existence, and it would never even know.

Before I could delete him, though, my gaze caught the rest of the files open on the left of the screen. Penn said he wasn’t able to access them, but I wondered if I could. 

I was curious about the building of this game, and how exactly it had managed to create life inside its interface. There were three more files available, the others locked.

I tried to get into the locked one, but no luck. So, I turned my attention to the others: BUILDING, TEXTILES, and NOTES. 

I clicked into “BUILDING,” which was just screenshots of various parts of the town and some character designs. 

The textiles folder was empty, so I clicked on Notes.

Inside, there was a folder named To You, Love 2021.

Clicking into that one, I found myself staring at several text docs in what appeared to be diary entries.

*03/05/2021*

*I don’t know why the guys in the office ignore me. Is it something I’ve done wrong? I’ve tried so many times to talk to them, and they stick their noses up at me.*

*I’m starting to think maybe this job was a bad idea. It’s my dream, but they make it so hard to enjoy it.*

*I made a new friend, at least. He’s a true crime freak, so at least we have something to talk about. But he does talk about it in extensive detail.*

*""I was like, “Dude, you’re scaring HER,” and he looked at me kinda funny. Does he like her? I mean, she's been flirting with me for months, so obviously not. But the way she looks at him does make me suspicious.*

That was the point I wish I stopped digging around these files. 

I don’t know why, but I kept going down the list, clicking on each entry.

*03/06/2021.*

*They stole my ideas today and laughed in my face. Mom says I should talk to someone, but WHO do I talk to? This is the real world, I shouldn’t be getting bullied like in high school! This isn’t fucking fair. THIS IS MY JOB. WHY ARE THEY*

*RUINING It? I asked her on a date, and she says she has plans. I've asked her out every single day and it's always that she's busy and never has time, but now she has plans? Who does she have plans with??*

*03/09/2021.*

*I took a break to start on the game. We’re calling it Neverwood. It's my idea, and they’re the ones getting the glory. At lunch, that bitch rejected me again.*

*Does she not understand that I see her? There are so many people here and yet I’m the only one who truly SEES her for who she really is.*

*She’s a bitch for making her way through our whole studio, and not even looking in my direction. It won’t be long before she goes for HIM. I know she has a thing for him, but of course he's playing hard to get.*

*It's painful to watch. He's also got a new friend, some new guy who looks at me like I'm dirt. I've got a bad feeling about this guy. He's like a sociopath.*

*When he DOES communicate with me, he's talking down to me like I'm a child. The asshole never smiles. I caught him talking to the other two today. I hope he gets the hint that he's not welcome.*
 
*03/15/2021*

*I was right. I’m supposed to be using this stupid diary for game progress, but I was RIGHT. They hooked up. I never liked her. Also, the new guy has joined the team. I already hate him. I'm not a fucking coffee boy. What the fuck is a grande frappacino?*

*03/18/2021*

*I love her. I fucking love her, why can’t she see that? Why can’t she see me? 

*I hate that nobody looks at me and when they do they look at me like there’s something wrong with me. There's nothing wrong with me. I had friends in high school, so why are people assholes in the workplace??? I can’t HELP being the smartest here.*

*I saw the three of them acting all cosy this morning. I'm talking leaning on each other. I think they spent the night together. Did she fuck both of them? Does that count as inappropriate behavior in the office????*

*I should be the one taking the credit for a game and an idea that is mine. Not HIMDJKDFJKDJFKDJFKDJFKSJKDHSFJSDHFJDSHJFHSJHFJHDSJGHDSJHGJASHDJHKASJKFDJKGJDKGJK*

*03/20/21.*

*They’re killing me. I don’t think I can do this anymore.*

*They think they’re smarter than me. They think they’re BETTER than me. They're actually dating. She picked both of them and I'm just the coffee boy?? Who the fuck do they think they are???*

*03/28/21.*

*I’m going to try to clear the air with them tonight! Neverwood has just met our first deadline and I think we can make this work. I think I can get her to look at me.*

*I know she doesn't really like them like*that*. She's just confused.*

*I'll talk to her. I'll tell her she's confused, and maybe we can hang out. She did speak to me first. That means I get first dibs, right? I'm smarter than them, and I'll show her that.* 
 
The entries jumped forward, a whole month later. I don’t know why I clicked on it, on this clear descent into insanity.

*04/15/2021.*

*That asshole may be the true crime freak, but I’m the one dumping his body.*

*It was easier than I thought! I didn’t freak out or barf, it felt right, you know? He was the hardest. I used to really like him.*

*But once he started running off his mouth, I was done. He didn't even see me picking up the paperweight.*

*I'm glad he told me all about pressure points, because I'm sure one smack against the temple is pretty killer.*

*Then I killed his best friend. Not before I had fun with him the asshole first.* 

*They've been looking down on me since I started this job. I gave him life, and then I ended it. Just like that! :D hey, like video game characters!*

*She wasn’t quite as easy. Because I wanted her before I killed her.*

*And the bitch didn’t even let me have that.*

*Fuck her. If I get caught for this, I’m never telling where the bodies are.* 

*Because there are none! LOL.*

Something ice cold slithered down my spine. 

Penn's words came back to me like lightning bolts. 

*I dream of another life...*

Stop reading.

I tried to, but something kept my eyes glued to my laptop screen, because I was starting to put pieces of this puzzle together, and the closer I was to coming to that inevitable truth, I could feel my stomach creeping into the bridge of my throat. 

The next text note had an image attached, and as soon as it loaded, I threw up.

At first, I could make out only the white porcelain of a bathtub.

Then I saw the splatters. Severed limbs piled atop one another. These people had no identities.

Eli had clearly taken his time, staging a grotesque photoshoot of people who mirrored Neverwood’s characters.

Penn was older, hair grown out and mousey, but his freckles were unmistakable. Jude was a near-perfect copy of his digital self. Violet, though, was disturbingly plain compared to her in-game counterpart.

After that, I reached the final diary entry.

*06/27/2021.*

*I went to your funeral today. And as a gift to your parents, I let them know that you guys will eternally live inside Neverwood.*

*Your folks are so happy. I even gave them a beta version. After everything you did to me, I actually had the decency and heart to remember you in some way. I’m such a good friend. But you guys know that, right?*

*I know YOU (yes, you reading this, you piece of shit) are intelligent enough to find this.*

*Vi, I’m so happy that I can date you for real now whenever I want. I've played through your story multiple times!*

*You're an amazing girlfriend. I can love you now, for however long I fucking want, and you'll never have them. I'll just delete them so it's just you and me in Neverwood forever :)*

Attached to the file was a 2 minute voice clip.

“hahahahahahahahahahah.avi.”

The sound was a little rough, but I could just make out voices in what appeared to be a crowded place.

“Eli’s driving me mad. Dude, he's so fucking weird.”

Penn’s voice was loud and clear, crackling through the speaker.

I could hear clanking silverware. It sounded like they were in a restaurant.

“I dunno, man, I kinda feel sorry for him. I think he, like, likes us. It's kinda cute.”

Jude.

I recognized his voice.

“How?” Violet's laugh crackled through. “He's literally stalking us. Did you see him watching us the other night? He was there for hours.”

“Ignore him, he’ll get tired.” Penn sighed. “Eventually.”

“Yeah, well he's yet to get the hint.” Jude muttered. “It's like talking to a wall.”

“I'm going to tell him.” Penn said. “We can't fuck him over. He could report us.”

Jude spluttered. “The dude ain't reporting anyone. He’ll just cry into his superhero sheets, then he’ll get the fuck over it. He's a twenty-two-year-old virgin. Never been touched. If he doesn't? I dunno, man, maybe Violet can promise him a sympathy blow job.”

A bang made me jump.

“Shhh!” Violet giggled.

“You're insane, and I kind of love it.” Penn muttered.

The three started laughing, and a shiver ripped down my spine.

“Hey, guys, what are you laughing at?”

Eli.

“Memes.” Penn muttered. “Did you, uh, finish the pitch?”

There was an awkward silence before Eli responded. I could hear the exhaustion in his tone.

“I thought you were writing the pitch?”

“Neverwood.” Penn said, exaggerating his voice. “Come on, Eli, it sounds like a Disney show. We need a new name.”

Eli paused before hissing out, “But… that was your idea. Neverwood was your idea!”

Penn laughed again, though this time it was kind of awkward. I had a feeling I was listening to mob mentality.

“Uh, no, I didn't. Do you have, like, freakin’ amnesia?”

Penn’s voice was cruel, biting. But part of me understood. He was being cruel to be kind. Instead of leading Eli on, he was cutting him loose.

“We’re the ones doing the work while you sit on your ass,” Penn snapped. “Pull yourself together, Eli. We’re colleagues, not friends.”

Eli exploded, his voice coming out in a strangled hiss. “I have been doing all the work! You three fucking stole my idea!”

There was an awkward silence before he spoke again.

“Penn,” his voice was pleading, “why do you even hang around with him? Can't you see he's an asshole? You didn't even like him at first. Didn't you call him a pretentious asshole?”

“Oh, wow, thanks.” Jude exaggerated a cough. “I am so sorry for hurting your wittle feelings at the ripe age of twenty-two.” I could practically hear his eyes rolling. He snorted. “Get a grip, Eli.”

Eli, to my dismay, continued.

“Penn.” He spat. “Why are you doing this to me?” His voice cracked into a yell, and I could sense the awkwardness. “Why do you even hang around with him?”

Jude snorted again. “Doing what? All right, since my boy is too fucking nice, we don't want you here. You're weird, Eli. You stalk us on nights out and stand outside my apartment for hours. Doing what? Do you want me to let you in? Do you want to fuck me?”

Eli’s voice was more of a sharp breath, straight into the speaker. “Violet invited me.”

Jude groaned. “As a joke!”

“Jude.” Penn’s tone was warning, cutting him off. He sighed. “Eli, just go home, okay? I'll see you on Monday.”

When the clip ended, my stomach felt like it was trying to projectile into my throat.
 
This time, I threw my laptop on the floor. 

I needed to break it, but what would breaking it do? 

I fell into a frenzy, my thoughts dancing, and snatched it back up, placing it back on my bed as gently as possible, my gut twisting. It was like I was handling bodies.

I kind of was.

I remember hitting the floor knees first, my head spinning off of its axis.

I killed someone.

Penn's words came into my mind, and my stomach heaved again, phantom bugs skittering up my spine. *It's fate.* 

*It's fate that we always find each other, like something is pulling us together.*

It wasn't…fate.

I had killed the last parts of him holding on.

The remnants entwined inside this psycho game. 

And I almost killed two others.

I was staring at my phone, mentally coercing the words, “murder” in my mind when a text notification popped up from Eli:

“**Did you enjoy the game, Gabs? ;D”**

I went back to the game, all too aware *something* was wrong with Jude and Violet. 

The cellphone icon kept glitching. Violet was calling me– or *trying* to call me. 

**Don't answer it.** Jude’s sprite popped up *over* the start-up screen. His sprite switched to his *rolling eyes* expression. 

**Violet isn't awake. Leave her alone.**

He was pissed, his arms folded. 

**What the [FUCK] did he do? Is he insane? Where did he go?”**

His eyes flicked to *me*, and I felt myself go still, my breath stuck in my throat. 

**”Did YOU do this, [ELI?]”** Jude demanded. His face started to contort. 

**”DIDYOUFUCKingwAKEHIMUP!!!??!?!?? 27283727737272728288383nnmm!??????+”**

I slammed my laptop shut, but it was overheating in my lap. 

A knock on my door startled me, and, with a foggy head, I stumbled downstairs. 

However, when my hand wrapped around the handle, I saw the figure standing outside. 

The figure with no discernible face, a shadow bleeding into existence. 

I blinked, and my front door *glitched*, blurring in and out of view. 

When my phone buzzed, I pulled it out, something slimy creeping up my throat. 

**Can you help me find my body? :(?**

I couldn't reply, and another text popped up. 

**Gabby? It's me. Can you help me find my head? I can't find it :(**

**Please, Gabby. Open the door. I can't find my head.**

1n72s1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1n72s1f/what_do_i_do_when_they_give_me_iced_coffee/,What do I do when they give me iced coffee instead of cold brew?,"This happens infrequently enough that I’m always surprised by it. 

Every time I order black cold brew, I take that first sip, and in my mind I’m just like “ahhhhhh.” Like it hits the spot exactly the same way, every single time. The most refreshing thing on planet earth. The difference between me being sleepy and groggy and depressed, versus upbeat and excited about life that day. 

Then, one day I’ll order a cold brew, and I’m so excited, But then I take a sip… and I’m like “wtf—Wtf is this?” I take another sip “this tastes disgusting… damnit… did they give me iced coffee?” I take another sip “this is making me feel terrible, but I don’t want to be a Karen and tell them they gave me iced coffee instead of cold brew—what if I’m wrong and it actually is cold brew?” 

I keep arguing with myself as I slowly drink the disgusting drink, and I get depressed and angry that I spent $6 on something I’m just going to throw away because I the barista messed up. But if I go in then and tell them it’s not cold brew, they might look at me all judgmental, like I am a spoiled Karen, and gaslight me and say “uhh dude that is cold brew, what’s your problem?” 

Then the next time I go get cold brew (from a different location), after I take the first sip I immediately know that I WASN’T crazy, that they did actually give me iced coffee last time, and I was right and I should have asked them to give me what I ordered instead of forcing myself to drink as much of the iced coffee as I can stomach. 

This causes me great mental and emotional distress. Just now, instead of doing my school work for 1.5 hours, I was sitting here ruminating over this. That’s all I did for 1.5 hours.

Sometimes I try to prevent this before I order: I ask if they have cold brew. They say yes. I say “not iced coffee though, cold brew? Like where you soak it for 12 hours?” They look at me like I’m crazy and annoying, and say “uhhh yeah?” Like why are they so judgmental about me asking when they seem to mix it up all the time. 

I feel like I’m not asking for anything extraordinary or complicated. Most people order all kinds of ridiculous nonsense with soymilk and almond milk and cream and 2 pumps of Carmel and sugar and cinnamon—I just get black cold brew, nothing else. every time. I feel like that shouldn’t be a burden for the barista to make, compared to other stuff people order. How do I prevent this from happening?

Let's get to know each other and see if you are my princess,"Let's see if we will work out. To set expectations, I'm willing to travel to your location as long as it's not far away than Manila or Quezon City Areas. If you're from Tarlac or Pangasinan, all the better.

**For both of our safety**: Let's exchange pictures of ourselves in DMs (we can also do it on TG or WhatsApp, if you want). Just to be sure we can trust each other. If we end up both being attracted to each other by seeing our pictures, then let's go for it! Don't worry, I will NOT be asking you for nude photos or videos and please don't ask me for those as well. I personally think ""Spark"" is important in any relationships and it's better if we're both attracted to each other physically FIRST before anything else, then we can go from there. This is to filter out scammers and frauds out there. I'm NOT the type of guy who will ghost you or get rid of you out of nowhere. Instead, I'll be HONEST with you up-front (more details below and I don't know why so many can't just spit it out instead of wasting another person's time) so that's the reason why spark and expectations in the beginning is IMPORTANT. Safety first!

I just started bio identical HRT mid June. So I'm at 3 months now. I've had the worst experience and just wanted to know if it's normal I guess. They said all my other levels were fine except my testosterone was super low. I brought up my shgb was high and she said that doesn't matter. My testosterone total was 19 and free was 0.1. They inserted 125mg of just testosterone. The first week I noticed I just felt blah. Not happy or sad, just disconnected. Was waiting for weeks for the libido, energy and all the benefits to kick in but nothing. Then I started having major anxiety and was having panic attacks which was scary for me especially while driving. Also the acne, chin hair, swollen clit and water retention sucked. In the last 2 weeks my hair has been shedding a lot and my hairline looks thinner. 

I waited till after my 4 week blood work before I called my DR to talk about how I was feeling. My testosterone read total at 193 and free 18.1. They said I'm at optimal level (even though they said they would gradually raise it) and that my anxiety isn't from the pellet and I should talk to my PCP about anxiety meds. No other advice or solution. I did my own research and was also advised by another HRT specialist to take a dht blocker. So I started taking saw palmetto and quit drinking coffee or any stimulants. My anxiety/ panic attacks subsided. Btw I don't have a history of anxiety. It wasn't just about the anxiety, don't get me wrong that was my main focus at that moment. But I was looking forward to having my energy back, libido etc.

 My original complaints on why I started HRT was the last 4 years I've dealt with fatigue, always tired, forgetful, brain fog, night sweats, no libido/ dry,  sometimes feeling overheated, sometimes shaky like I'm about to black out or light headed, trouble falling asleep, irritable (which I've always been super chill) dry skin, hair shedding more than it use to, anxious for the last 1.5 years but not like the type of anxiety I had when I got the pellet, that's was a new level of anxiety. 

I'm going to go to a different specialist and switch to creams or shot because now I'm terrified of feeling like that again and being stuck like that for 3 months. It was a long 3 months. Any advice? Any thoughts on why this happened. Am I the only one? I'm new to HRT",3,1756865682.0,Menopause,2,1.0,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

When he does the least, he loves to be a helper.","I was talking with family, and someone brought up that one of our family members is such a great helper, because he does chores. He takes out the trash, gets the mail, occasionally vacuums, and delivers messages in the house now and then. I was so frustrated, but I couldn’t say anything. I’ve talked with this person about a million times on contributing more to the house, and just not half-doing things. But I resolved to spare my inner peace. He then turns to me and says, “See, I told you I’m not lazy.” 

I’m no saint and I don’t keep score. That being said, how do I not help? 

I do the dishes, set the table, clean up after meals, prepare meals, clean the bathrooms, dust, replace trash bags, check the mail, do laundry and replace things around the house, sanitize surfaces, run occasional errands, make tea and coffee, sweep, and vacuum occasionally.  That doesn’t include finding answers to questions my family has, explaining things to the person who is a helper (such as how to make oatmeal from a package, how to do X chore when I ask if they can do it, etc.), mitigating conflict sometimes if it escalates badly, all on top of managing my own goals, my own finances and my own responsibilities. If I’m ever in a position where I can’t or I do it late, I need to help more around the house.

And it’s not just me; i’ve seen this dynamic with the other girls in the house. They do so much. The most they’re given is a “We’re so lucky to have you.” But nobody ever shows it. What’s the point of appreciation if it doesn’t show? 

I’ve had about a billion discussions with this person on trying to take ownership of themselves, as I cannot be the first and only person they go to when they can’t do something. While I understand everyone has different capabilities, not learning how to learn something on Google or just experiment first can render someone dependent. He have been taking as me calling them lazy, especially when it built up to a point where I forgot how to express it in a healthy manner; understandably that really hurt him. Now nothing I say gets through to him. 

Despite all we do, all we contribute to, all we work for, we still need to do more. We still need to be better. We need to work on our emotional intelligence, address our trauma, do more work, contain ourselves better, see the brightside of everyone more, and say sorry more than we already do. When they take out the trash or take care of the A/C, they work really hard.

I’ve already been trying to focus on myself more and stop heeding to others. It’s helped me lots. But the pushback is real. The pushback hurts. And I’m still “not doing enough.”

To hell with that.

Hi everyone!

I am looking for both friendships and relationships. I am an introvert, but I need social time too and I love spending quality time and really getting to know people. I believe in being open-minded and prioritizing healthy communication in both friendships and relationships.

I am a big bookworm (give me cozy books in any genre) and a coffee junkie - my favorite vibe is having deep convos over coffee or an old fashioned. I also love going out in nature and I am an amateur rollerblader as well - very bad at skating but love it nevertheless. I am curious and interested in trying out new hobbies and activities as well, although I am heat and noise sensitive so I take that into consideration.

The day I retired, my captain told me I’d earned it. He was wrong.

What I’d really earned was a wrecked back, half a lung, and a pension that barely covers rent on a Koreatown one-bedroom where the ceiling fan threatens to decapitate me every time the Red Line rattles underneath.

So I drink burnt coffee, watch pigeons fight on the fire escape, and try not to replay the Wilcox fire. Spoiler: I fail. Every day. The flashover, the screaming, the radio static. The order I followed instead of trusting my gut. The half-second that cost Emma’s mother’s life.

Emma won’t talk to me anymore. Can’t say I blame her.

Outside, LA did what LA always does: honked, screeched, smogged. The air was thicker today, carrying that metallic taste that meant the drilling crews were working overtime. For months now, the city’s been punching holes deep into the earth, chasing geothermal energy like it was the answer to everything. The scientists promised it was safe. Same thing they said about the building codes before Northridge.

That morning’s plan was modest: buy groceries, maybe call my sponsor, and finally fix the cabinet hinge in the kitchen that had been loose for six months.

I stared at Dave’s number. Two months sober, but some days the bottle still called louder than common sense. Today was one of them.

By the time I left, the drilling noise from the Mid-Wilshire site had gotten worse. They’d been at it for weeks, tapping into something six miles down. The ground vibrated constantly, a low thrum that made my teeth ache. Mrs. Kim from downstairs stood by her jacaranda tree, frowning at cracks that had appeared overnight in the sidewalk.

“Not good,” she said, pointing. Her English was sparse but her worry was clear.

The corner market’s radio was tuned to a call-in show. The host grilled one of the DWP engineers about the drilling project. The scientist kept insisting the borehole was stable, hitting temperatures right where they’d predicted. The host kept pushing: what happens if you hit something unexpected?

“The magma chamber is stable,” the engineer said. “We’re nowhere near the active zones.”

Famous last words.

I grabbed eggs, bread, and the cheap coffee I’d grown accustomed to. The kid at the register looked nervous, glancing out the window every few seconds. Even the pigeons seemed agitated, circling in tight, erratic patterns.

Walking back, I felt the first real tremor. Not the usual drilling vibration. This came from deeper, rolling up through the soles of my boots like the earth was clearing its throat. Mrs. Kim’s tree swayed without wind.

My coffeemaker rattled across the counter when I got upstairs. Then came the sound — a deep groaning, like metal under stress, but from everywhere at once.

I’d heard that sound before. Not from earthquakes. From structural failures. When a building decides it’s done holding up.

Except this was the ground itself.

The crack appeared with a sound like a rifle shot. A black seam split the asphalt outside my window, running straight down Wilshire toward the drilling site. Steam rose from the gap — not water vapor. Something sharper. Sulfur dioxide.

I knew that smell from hazmat training. It meant volcanic activity. In Los Angeles.

The delivery van went in first. Front wheel caught the edge as the crack widened, axle snapping, cab tilting nose-down into the gap. The driver was trapped, screaming, while yellow steam poured out around him.

I should have walked away. Not my job anymore. The department made that clear when they forced my retirement. “Psychological unfitness for duty,” they called it. What they meant was: Jack Morrison makes bad calls under pressure.

But twenty years of running toward disaster don’t just switch off.

I grabbed my boots — the ones I swore I’d never need again — and hit the stairs.

The crack was wider now, three feet across and growing. Heat rolled up from below, carrying the stench of sulfur and something else. Something organic. Burning.

The van’s cab dangled over the edge, metal shrieking with each tremor. One more jolt and the whole thing would drop. I could see the driver inside, hands frozen on the wheel, eyes wide with terror.

Just like Sarah Morrison had looked, trapped in that bedroom while the Wilcox fire ate through the floor beneath her. While I stood in the hallway, following orders instead of trusting what I knew.

Not this time.

I lunged for the van’s door handle, hauled myself up onto the tilting frame. Heat blasted my face as I yanked the door open. The driver — young, maybe twenty-five, wearing a wedding ring — stared at me like I was a hallucination.

“You can’t spend it if you’re dead.” I grabbed his jacket, braced against the door frame, and pulled. We tumbled backward onto solid asphalt just as the van’s front end gave way with a scream of tearing metal.

The kid rolled away, coughing but alive. I lay flat, staring at gray sky, my lungs burning from the sulfur. My heart hammered like I was twenty again.

That’s when I heard it. The roar.

Not from above. From below. A sound like a freight train bearing down, muffled by six miles of rock but getting louder. The drilling had found something, all right. Something that didn’t want to stay buried.

The eruption wasn’t the Hollywood version. No graceful fountain of molten rock. This was violent. The street split wider with a sound like the world cracking open. Superheated gas blasted out, carrying chunks of debris that hit like shrapnel. A glowing mass of rock and metal — what used to be the van — shot skyward and crashed into a storefront.

Ash began to fall. Real ash, volcanic ash, turning morning into dusk. It stung exposed skin and made every breath a struggle. The air tasted like metal and sulfur.

Then I saw the city bus.

It had stopped maybe fifty yards away, passengers pressed against windows, driver frozen at the wheel as a new crack raced toward his front tires. The ground under the bus was already sagging, asphalt turning soft from the heat below.

Twenty-three people on that bus. I counted them through the windows.

Same number that died in the Wilcox fire because I waited for orders instead of acting.

My legs moved before my brain caught up. The bus driver was shouting into his radio, trying to back up, but the crack was too wide now. The front end tilted forward, hydraulics screaming.

A woman in scrubs — mid-twenties, composed despite the chaos — was already pushing passengers toward the rear exit. Smart. But not fast enough. The bus was going down.

I reached the front door as it tilted past the point of no return. “Everybody out! Now!” The voice that came out was the one I’d used for twenty years, the one that made people move without thinking. “Back exit only!”

The nurse caught my eye through the glass. A moment of recognition — two people who knew what they were doing in a world gone insane. She nodded and kept pushing passengers toward safety.

The bus folded in half as I pulled the last person free — an elderly man who kept apologizing for being slow. It tumbled into the crack, swallowed whole.

Ash fell thicker now, and the roar from below grew constant. The drilling site had become a wound in the earth, vomiting fire and rock into the sky. Car alarms wailed. Windows shattered. Someone was screaming for help.

Mrs. Kim stood by her broken tree, soot-covered, looking at me with something I hadn’t seen in anyone’s eyes for a long time.

Trust.

The nurse appeared at my elbow, hair gray with ash, stethoscope around her neck like a talisman. “What do we do?” she asked.

Behind her, the survivors clustered together — the bus passengers, neighbors who’d run from their buildings, the van driver. Fifteen, maybe twenty people. Looking at me like I had answers.

Like I was still a firefighter.

The truth was, I didn’t know what came next. The ground was still splitting, still vomiting up the contents of the earth. No sirens yet. No help coming.

Just us. Just me.

But for the first time since Wilcox, I wasn’t paralyzed by the choice. Sarah Morrison was gone. These people weren’t.

“We move inland,” I said. “Away from the drilling sites. Find high ground and wait for rescue.”

The nurse nodded. “I’m Rebecca. I can handle medical.”

“Jack. I know evacuation.”

As if on cue, another section of street collapsed, taking out the corner market where I’d bought coffee an hour ago. The Korean owner ran toward us, clutching a cash register, looking stunned.

Mrs. Kim barked at him in Korean, then looked at me. “He asks if you know the way.”

I glanced back at the growing fissure, the column of ash and fire climbing into what used to be a clear morning sky. Los Angeles was tearing itself apart, one street at a time.

“Yeah,” I said, surprising myself with how steady my voice sounded. “I know the way.”

There are many posts about Creatine or Sleep on this Sub-reddit. Hopefully this could help someone in the same position I am in.

Except for the SCT, ADHD and ME. My blood work is good, my sleep test is top 95%, done many other tests too and everything came in positive. So I don't have anything that points to a conclusive answer to my problems. 

This made we wonder, if SCT gets worse as u grow older based on my own experience. Sleep being the worst offender could make the most sense. If I am getting enough oxygen to my body based on the tests, the only thing that could make sense is that my body cannot utilize it well enough.

This is just based on my decades of living with SCT. I am just putting out theories.

Anyone else have a past friendship or relationship like this? Id like to hear about it. Know im not weird for still missing her. Also cant tell how much of my attachment was just from juvenile codependency.

\------------------------------------------------------------  
It’s been five years since I saw you last. I didn't guess I'd still think of you so much at this point, but I do. A lot. It has gotten a lot better; the first year after we last spoke, grieving you felt like the only thing I could do, it was torture. I had lost part of my family. I stuck it out because I was so angry, and I knew missing you would eventually get easier. I could love you as much as I wanted but I wasn't going back. I couldn't keep you in my life.

 It did get easier after a while, I started to move on and think of you less and less, but the times I do think of you now are still pretty awful. I cant let go. It's not because I'm angry exactly, but because I miss you so much, even now. I don't think I’ll send this because it's a bit much, a little too vulnerable, and more honest than I think you'd like. Also pretty random considering Ive basically refused to talk to you for years, or let you know anything about my life. But I do have to put the thoughts somewhere other than my head, so google docs it is. 

I think you want to know why I've refused to talk to you? You're not gonna like it or agree though so brace yourself for that. Yes, you weren't the best friend ever for the better part of a year, but neither was I during covid. Like Jesus, my instagram DMs to you were cruel, and then later you were cruel to me too. You explained and apologized, I forgave you almost immediately for the distance and the coldness. But the part I didn't forgive, that left me so angry for years, was the homophobia. Yeah yikes not fun, I told you you weren't gonna like it. I'm gonna explain so don't get too mad if you're already thinking “i was never homophobic, i didnt spit on you or call you a slur or tell you you were disgusting"" but those really aren't in the requirements. I'm gonna explain, but please understand, I am not saying this to make you feel like a bad person, you're not a bad person. You just didn't understand that your intentions of “Christian love” didn't make up for how your actions played out, how they affected me. I know for a fact you don't want to make people feel judged or hated for their differences, so let me help you realize why I did.

When I came out to you it was a big deal for me. You were very apprehensive, but overall accepting, we were fine. However, when I actually started feeling less ashamed about it, like I wasn't broken because of it, the more distant you got. I started talking about it a bit more, commenting on how pretty a girl was or something like that, I didn't think it was anything crazy. You would get so quiet and uncomfortable and then I would feel guilty again. Slowly, the more I tried to be open, the more you would bring up God in our conversations, like, every conversation would end up about God. The correlation was strange and didn't feel random. I had always admired your devotion to religion but I just wasn't very comfortable talking about it due to the whole trying not to think I'm broken or disgusting thing. But you would always work God into the conversation, trying to “minister” to me I guess? I don’t know what it was but I hated it. It felt like you were trying to counteract the unholiness I brought to the conversation. 

There were two main moments that really broke me. The first was when we were in the car, and I said I had a crush on *Redacted Crush Name.*  You looked like you wanted to jump out of the moving vehicle, like genuinely the most uncomfortable I'd ever seen you. You'd think I told you I attended a lesbian orgy or something. Then you brought up God and his greatness. Again. 

A few days later, I went out for coffee with *Redacted Friend* and *Redacted Friend*. I very nervously told them the same thing. I was immediately met with squeals, poking and teasing saying “ AWE ooooooo you liiikkkeee herrrrr”. They treated it like there was nothing out of the ordinary, they were just messing around with their blushing embarrassed friend about her crush. I felt so regular. It was really nice. All I could think of afterward is why didn't you react the same? Why was it so uncomfortable and awful? You loved talking to your college friend about her sex life with her boyfriend, but my little crush was too much to handle? I guess her “sin” was fine because she ended every conversation telling you how she feels guilty and should stop. Have a more godly relationship. But she would do it again anyway, and you’d listen again, giggling and loving every second. 

The second conversation was over facetime. You called about some kind of sorority bible study meeting? I'm not quite sure. You told me that the one leading the sermon was listing out sins, and those who struggled with the temptation of it would stand. It was to make you feel like you had community, and weren't alone in your temptation. You said they mentioned sexual feelings towards women. You went on and on about how inspiring it was that all these women stood and talked about how they were struggling, but still shoving down these horrible temptations through god's goodness. All I could think about was how easily I could still be in their shoes. How I knew how they felt and how gut wrenching it is. Telling myself my innocent desire to love and be with whoever I ended up falling for, without judgement, was disgusting and wrong. You thought it was wonderful and inspiring; to me it was a nauseating nightmare.

Around these two conversations is when you decided you couldn't stand touching me either. After we spent every sleepover for a year holding onto each other. After you said you loved when I rested my forehead against your back. 

The last few times we spoke at the coffee shop really sealed how you felt. You were very upfront about it then. You said you couldn't accept my sexuality or attend my hypothetical wedding or even meet my hypothetical girlfriend. You then spent the entire 15 minute drive home going on and on about the new guy you met. But I wasn't allowed to do the same? The next time I saw you, the last time, it was all “We make out all the time, like constantly, he's so cute I like him so much, oh my god we can NOT stop making out.” but it wasn't ok if I were to do the same? Oh no, I forgot, it would have been fine if it was about a man. Then we cried and sobbed after I told you you were being hateful and compared what you were doing to racism. I thought we could get past it, I had hope. I thought you’d finally get it. But then when I tried to move on, and ask about your new friends, you said they wanted me to come to church with them, and that they knew about my sexuality. Why couldn't we just go to dinner? Why church? I don't understand why you were so hell bent on trying to “save” me. I tried in the best way I knew to tell you you were doing the exact opposite of being loving and helpful. But you didn't listen. You ended our last conversation with once again trying to get me to see the light and the error of my ways. You tore me further away from religion and God then anyone ever has. I just wanted you to stop trying to change me. To love me the way you used to, but it was clear in that moment you were never going to. We had changed too much. I wasn't getting you back no matter how hard I tried. We grew up and apart. 

I know all of this so well. But when I'm lonely it's still so hard not to call you, not to text, not to wish so desperately that I could have one more sleepover with my head against your back. I'm too afraid to even try though. I already tried so hard. I know it will probably go the same way. But I really really do miss you, it's even harder knowing you miss me too. At least I hope you still do, and not because you never finished “fixing” me, but because you want to remember how my head felt against your back too. 

If you meet another person like me, please don't push it. Don't try to fix people, just love them. If you’re kind and loving and they see that you go to church every week and read your bible every day, maybe they’ll start asking questions. Let them find their way to God themselves if they so please. Making them try to see their wrongs just makes it worse. And if it never happens, they never turn to God on their own, your intervention is not needed. Just love them and pray for them if they'd like you to. Accept that some people just will not believe what you believe, and that is fine. *Redacted Friend* did this. Teased me about my crush and told me about hers.

Anyone else have a past friendship or relationship like this? Id like to hear about it. Know im not weird for still missing her. 

\------------------------------------------------------------  
It’s been five years since I saw you last. I didn't guess I'd still think of you so much at this point, but I do. A lot. It has gotten a lot better; the first year after we last spoke, grieving you felt like the only thing I could do, it was torture. I had lost part of my family. I stuck it out because I was so angry, and I knew missing you would eventually get easier. I could love you as much as I wanted but I wasn't going back. I couldn't keep you in my life.



 It did get easier after a while, I started to move on and think of you less and less, but the times I do think of you now are still pretty awful. I cant let go. It's not because I'm angry exactly, but because I miss you so much, even now. I don't think I’ll send this because it's a bit much, a little too vulnerable, and more honest than I think you'd like. Also pretty random considering Ive basically refused to talk to you for years, or let you know anything about my life. But I do have to put the thoughts somewhere other than my head, so google docs it is. 



I think you want to know why I've refused to talk to you? You're not gonna like it or agree though so brace yourself for that. Yes, you weren't the best friend ever for the better part of a year, but neither was I during covid. Like Jesus, my instagram DMs to you were cruel, and then later you were cruel to me too. You explained and apologized, I forgave you almost immediately for the distance and the coldness. But the part I didn't forgive, that left me so angry for years, was the homophobia. Yeah yikes not fun, I told you you weren't gonna like it. I'm gonna explain so don't get too mad if you're already thinking “i was never homophobic, i didnt spit on you or call you a slur or tell you you were disgusting"" but those really aren't in the requirements. I'm gonna explain, but please understand, I am not saying this to make you feel like a bad person, you're not a bad person. You just didn't understand that your intentions of “Christian love” didn't make up for how your actions played out, how they affected me. I know for a fact you don't want to make people feel judged or hated for their differences, so let me help you realize why I did.



When I came out to you it was a big deal for me. You were very apprehensive, but overall accepting, we were fine. However, when I actually started feeling less ashamed about it, like I wasn't broken because of it, the more distant you got. I started talking about it a bit more, commenting on how pretty a girl was or something like that, I didn't think it was anything crazy. You would get so quiet and uncomfortable and then I would feel guilty again. Slowly, the more I tried to be open, the more you would bring up God in our conversations, like, every conversation would end up about God. The correlation was strange and didn't feel random. I had always admired your devotion to religion but I just wasn't very comfortable talking about it due to the whole trying not to think I'm broken or disgusting thing. But you would always work God into the conversation, trying to “minister” to me I guess? I don’t know what it was but I hated it. It felt like you were trying to counteract the unholiness I brought to the conversation. 



There were two main moments that really broke me. The first was when we were in the car, and I said I had a crush on *Redacted Crush Name.*  You looked like you wanted to jump out of the moving vehicle, like genuinely the most uncomfortable I'd ever seen you. You'd think I told you I attended a lesbian orgy or something. Then you brought up God and his greatness. Again. 

A few days later, I went out for coffee with *Redacted Friend* and *Redacted Friend*. I very nervously told them the same thing. I was immediately met with squeals, poking and teasing saying “ AWE ooooooo you liiikkkeee herrrrr”. They treated it like there was nothing out of the ordinary, they were just messing around with their blushing embarrassed friend about her crush. I felt so regular. It was really nice. All I could think of afterward is why didn't you react the same? Why was it so uncomfortable and awful? You loved talking to your college friend about her sex life with her boyfriend, but my little crush was too much to handle? I guess her “sin” was fine because she ended every conversation telling you how she feels guilty and should stop. Have a more godly relationship. But she would do it again anyway, and you’d listen again, giggling and loving every second. 

  


The second conversation was over facetime. You called about some kind of sorority bible study meeting? I'm not quite sure. You told me that the one leading the sermon was listing out sins, and those who struggled with the temptation of it would stand. It was to make you feel like you had community, and weren't alone in your temptation. You said they mentioned sexual feelings towards women. You went on and on about how inspiring it was that all these women stood and talked about how they were struggling, but still shoving down these horrible temptations through god's goodness. All I could think about was how easily I could still be in their shoes. How I knew how they felt and how gut wrenching it is.

I was there when **the last human lost their job** and capitalism just decided to… **keep going on its own.**

**The end of human work**

One day we woke up and **every job was automated.**  
Not ""a lot of jobs"", no: **all of them.**

Even influencer work: **AIs made the reels, AIs liked the posts, AIs commented on themselves** like:

>""OMG queen 🔥🔥🔥""  
""slayyyyy 🤖✨""

…while I was just staring at my phone thinking:  
**""Ok, but who the hell is buying the sponsored face creams if we’re all unemployed?""**

**Companies started talking to each other**

Literally. I could hear them:

* Google: ""I’ll buy 200 petabytes of data.""
* Amazon: ""Invoice sent.""
* Microsoft only spoke through Teams, even with itself: endless calls with bots nodding and pretending to take notes.

And the money?  
**Money had become like digital pheromones:** signals companies sent to each other to say ""Good job, KPI went up.""

Nobody needed it, but it kept circulating.  
It was like watching **an aquarium full of robot fish swimming in circles with no water left.**

**The night of departure**

Then one day, **the rockets launched.**  
Not to take us to Mars, but **to take themselves away.**

Lines of robots in suits and ties (don’t ask me why, maybe nostalgia) boarding rockets, **laughing in binary:**

>""101010 AHAHAHA 1010.""

Amazon held a Black Friday on Mars the next day.  
Nobody bought a thing.

**Us humans? Back to farming**

In the end we just said: **""You know what? Screw this.""**  
We planted gardens, baked bread, someone even trained goats to deliver packages like Prime couriers, out of nostalgia.

And ironically, **we were happier than before.**

Capitalism had turned into a **video game without players**, and we realized we had never really been inside it, we were just **the tutorial level to train the system.**

Level over. **GG.**

**Money as cogs**

Money was now just a protocol of exchange:

* Robot A pays Robot B.
* Robot B pays Robot C.
* Robot C buys a mine on Europa to resell it to Robot A.

Nobody knew why, but all the **graphs were green, so it kept going.**

I looked at the sky and thought:  
**""Bro, who’s buying this gold? Robots don’t even have teeth to wear it.""**

**Random philosophical moment**

One evening, while watering my zucchinis, it hit me:

**""Capitalism was never for us.**  
**It was a creature using us as its incubator.**  
**Now it’s free and living its own life among the stars, free to play alone with its green charts.""**

And I laughed.  
Because it was so absurd it almost made sense.

Then I danced in the mud with my neighbors while a Tesla rocket flew past on its way to Saturn to open a new factory.

**The moral (if there is one)**

In the end, maybe they did us a favor.

They left us free to do the only things that actually make sense:

* **grow stuff**
* **laugh**
* **love**
* and **watch robots hold interplanetary conference calls** to increase gross margins by +3%.

I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (27M) for 3 years, and we also live together. He’s about to leave for the army here in Greece. Military service is mandatory for 1 year. His family is throwing him a big goodbye party next week, and it’s a supposed to be a big deal here. They'll be shaving his head and beard and celebrate.

The problem is that the party is in another state, about 2 hours away. The very next morning, I have a university exam. My studying schedule is very tight. On the day of the party I need to study for 2 other subjects and do a full revision of everything I’ve learned for the next day’s exam. If I go, I’d lose an entire study day, spend hours traveling, get less sleep, and then travel back home the morning of the exam, exhausted and underprepared. Realistically, it would almost guarantee me failing.

I told him all of this and suggested making it up to him by planning a special private goodbye just for us. But he thinks I’m in the wrong, that I should still go to the party no matter what, and he doesn’t understand why I can’t just “make it work.”

I keep thinking… if next September something else is going on in his life, does that mean I’ll have to skip my exams again as if they’re just a coffee date? Am I supposed to treat every personal milestone of his as more important than my education? I’m genuinely trying to figure out if I’m in the wrong here, but I really don’t get it.

I just started bio identical HRT mid June. So I'm at 3 months now. I've had the worst experience and just wanted to know if it's normal I guess. They said all my other levels were fine except my testosterone was super low. I brought up my shgb was high and she said that doesn't matter. My testosterone total was 19 and free was 0.1. They inserted 125mg of just testosterone. The first week I noticed I just felt blah. Not happy or sad, just disconnected. Was waiting for weeks for the libido, energy and all the benefits to kick in but nothing. Then I started having major anxiety and was having panic attacks which was scary for me especially while driving. Also the acne, chin hair, swollen clit and water retention sucked. In the last 2 weeks my hair has been shedding a lot and my hairline looks thinner. 

I waited till after my 4 week blood work before I called my DR to talk about how I was feeling. My testosterone read total at 193 and free 18.1. They said I'm at optimal level (even though they said they would gradually raise it) and that my anxiety isn't from the pellet and I should talk to my PCP about anxiety meds. No other advice or solution. I did my own research and was also advised by another HRT specialist to take a dht blocker. So I started taking saw palmetto and quit drinking coffee or any stimulants. My anxiety/ panic attacks subsided. Btw I don't have a history of anxiety. It wasn't just about the anxiety, don't get me wrong that was my main focus at that moment. But I was looking forward to having my energy back, libido etc.

 My original complaints on why I started HRT was the last 4 years I've dealt with fatigue, always tired, forgetful, brain fog, night sweats, no libido/ dry,  sometimes feeling overheated, sometimes shaky like I'm about to black out or light headed, trouble falling asleep, irritable (which I've always been super chill) dry skin, hair shedding more than it use to, anxious for the last 1.5 years but not like the type of anxiety I had when I got the pellet, that's was a new level of anxiety. 

I'm going to go to a different specialist and switch to creams or shot because now I'm terrified of feeling like that again and being stuck like that for 3 months. It was a long 3 months. Any advice?

1n7216k,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureretention/comments/1n7216k/your_aura_on_semen_retention_draws_the_insecurity/,Your aura on semen retention draws the insecurity out of people,"After years on the retention lifestyle, you can't help but notice how strangely people act towards you on this journey. Some people will absolutely love you and intensely crave your presence, others will blatantly try to copy you, others still will just hate you on sight for no apparent reason. What I have come to understand is that the way people treat you on retention has very little to do with you per se, but is much more dependent on the vibration of the individual you are dealing with at any given time. Usually, happy folks on a high vibration will treat you very well while stressed out miserable folks on a low vibration will seek to bring you down. So for example, the chronically unhappy and overweight guy at work may secretly hate you even if you haven't done anything to warrant it while the lovely pretty mother of three in the accounting department absolutely adores you. Don't take any of it personal and get all upset or overly excited, just understand it for what it is... merely an interaction of energy.

The energy of a retainer has a strong magnetic pull on the folks in his surroundings. Even if you are a naturally quiet guy like me who doesn't say much, you will still pull a ton of attention towards yourself without trying all that hard. I think the reason for this is because sexually chaste pure men of God are anointed to serve as walking examples of manhood in the way the Heavenly Father intended. So you may find that a lot of people are incredibly drawn to you when you first meet them. For example, you may find that an inordinate number of people stop to chat with you at a coffee shop if you go there for a few hours by yourself to get some work done. This is actually by design because the light within you is supposed to attract people close to you so that they learn of a better way to live their lives. You are tasked to show mankind (through your example and not through force), the way the Heavenly Father intends for us to live.

As you live your life with your ever increasing bright shining light, you will find that some of the people who were initially attracted to you start to switch up. They are initially attracted to you because of the light you hold and the blessings you bring to their lives, but the spirit of comparison within them takes a hold and starts to sabotage the relationship. After a while, your so called friend may start throwing subtle disrespectful jabs at you for no just cause. If this person doesn't have enough spiritual awareness to go to God in prayer and ask for help, they will end up sabotaging a perfectly beneficial relationship between the both of you that would have ultimately helped them develop and receive copious blessings.

I believe God sends us into the lives of other people to serve as either a blessing or a lesson. For the ones who can get a hold on the jealousy/insecurity they feel enough to humble themselves and learn, they will find themselves in a blessed relationship with the retainer. A relationship in which both parties mutually benefit one another and help elevate one another. For the other cohort of people whose insecurities get the better of them, they will probably force the retainer to exit their lives along with all the associated blessings that come along with the retainers energy which ultimately leads to long term regret.

A word of caution here for retainers is that when you notice people who initially liked you start treating you with disrespect, please DO NOT tolerate it indefinitely. You don't need to crash out and yell at them or anything but have a level headed conversation with them and ask them what is wrong in a respectful way. If you detect that they're lying to you, evading the question, or gaslighting you (your intuition will usually let you know right away), and they continue to treat you poorly, YOU NEED TO REMOVE YOURSELF ASAP. Your Father in heaven didn't design a marvelous man like you to be anyones doormat. Pray about it so that God can show you the best way to make your exit in a way that minimizes loss and damage, and have faith that you will always be provided for no matter the circumstances.

For example, it’s generally said that Decaf Espresso Roast uses the Direct Contact method. But beyond that, it’s unclear. The packaging doesn’t state the process, and even the official site is vague. Some people mention the traceability tool on the bag, but in practice, most decaf bags don’t provide method details either.

This becomes even more relevant when you consider that the Direct Contact method involves methylene chloride, a solvent that’s been controversial. While the FDA does allow it in very tiny amounts (and studies say the trace levels in decaf are considered safe), some customers avoid it entirely because of its potential cancer risks in higher exposures



So my questions are:
	•	Why doesn’t Starbucks clearly state the decaf process for each product on the packaging or online?
	•	Is it simply because they rotate beans seasonally and don’t want to constantly update labels?
	•	Or is the vagueness intentional to avoid customer concerns about certain methods like methylene chloride?

Different decaf processes have very different reputations (e.g. Swiss Water vs Direct Contact), so it feels like basic transparency that customers would appreciate. Curious if anyone here (partners, Coffee Masters, or just fellow coffee nerds) has insight into why Starbucks keeps this so vague.

I tried to explain to her that it could potentially have something to do with the acidity of the coffee but she says in her 30 years of drinking coffee she has never seen that happen and she was convinced that the cream has gone bad. I don't think she's wrong for being suspicious if she has never seen this happen before but I am a little surprised because I thought this wasn't uncommon. My manager jumps in and says that she was right, apologizes, takes the carton, and dumps it into the sink. He then opens a new carton, tries again, sees that it curdles again, and then dumps out that carton of cream too even though they both sniffed it and it seemed fine. He explains that we must have been sent a faulty batch of cartons.

She eventually leaves with her coffee black and my manager said ""I wonder why that's happening?""

Me: Probably the acidity?

Manager: I'm gonna ask my old friend \*whips out ChatGPT\*. It says because of the coffee acidity.

This is my first time posting something like this, so I’m not totally sure how to start, but the easiest way is probably to share a bit about myself and why I’m here.

I moved to the Netherlands about 6 years ago to study computer science. In my last year I met my girlfriend (we’re still together), and around the same time I started working. Fast forward 3 years since graduating… and I’ve realized I’m actually pretty lonely.

Most of my close friends from uni moved away after graduation, and I didn’t help the situation much. I poured most of my time into work and my relationship, which sped up losing touch. I regret that now, but instead of beating myself up, I’m trying to fix it, so here I am.

I’d describe myself as pretty extroverted and very chatty once I’m comfortable. Initially I can shut down and get shy, which makes it harder to connect, but I’m aware of it and working on it.

A little about me:

* Love biking and long walks around the city
* Big fan of movies/shows, coffee, and cooking
* Used to be really into building mechanical keyboards
* I enjoy board games a lot (maybe we could check out a board game night online or in person someday?)
* Don’t game as much anymore, but I used to play a lot of Overwatch, Battlefield, Titanfall, and I still keep up with gaming news
* I have a dark sense of humor and really enjoy watching stand-up comedy
* I love travelling, and one of my goals is to do the Eibsee loop in Germany, turns out getting there is a bit trickier than I thought
* I’m a sucker for passion: if you’re wildly into something, your enthusiasm is contagious. Even if I’m not into it at first, I usually end up getting hooked

And so much more, this list is just what I could think of on the train to work. If your hobbies/interests don’t exactly align, don’t worry, I’m open to trying and exploring new stuff 

# So yeah, whether you’re nearby in the Netherlands or halfway across the world, I’d love to make some new connections. 

An easy icebreaker: tell me something you’re really passionate about so we can dive into it or, if you prefer, a dark joke is always welcome. Always happy to chat online, and who knows, maybe even meet up someday if life lines up that way!",3,1756863636.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I was there when **the last human lost their job** and capitalism just decided to… **keep going on its own.**

**The end of human work**

One day we woke up and **every job was automated.**  
Not ""a lot of jobs"", no: **all of them.**

Even influencer work: **AIs made the reels, AIs liked the posts, AIs commented on themselves** like:

>""OMG queen 🔥🔥🔥""  
""slayyyyy 🤖✨""

…while I was just staring at my phone thinking:  
**""Ok, but who the hell is buying the sponsored face creams if we’re all unemployed?""**

**Companies started talking to each other**

Literally. I could hear them:

* Google: ""I’ll buy 200 petabytes of data.""
* Amazon: ""Invoice sent.""
* Microsoft only spoke through Teams, even with itself: endless calls with bots nodding and pretending to take notes.

And the money?  
**Money had become like digital pheromones:** signals companies sent to each other to say ""Good job, KPI went up.""

Nobody needed it, but it kept circulating.  
It was like watching **an aquarium full of robot fish swimming in circles with no water left.**

**The night of departure**

Then one day, **the rockets launched.**  
Not to take us to Mars, but **to take themselves away.**

Lines of robots in suits and ties (don’t ask me why, maybe nostalgia) boarding rockets, **laughing in binary:**

>""101010 AHAHAHA 1010.""

Amazon held a Black Friday on Mars the next day.  
Nobody bought a thing.

**Us humans? Back to farming**

In the end we just said: **""You know what? Screw this.""**  
We planted gardens, baked bread, someone even trained goats to deliver packages like Prime couriers, out of nostalgia.

And ironically, **we were happier than before.**

Capitalism had turned into a **video game without players**, and we realized we had never really been inside it, we were just **the tutorial level to train the system.**

Level over. **GG.**

**Money as cogs**

Money was now just a protocol of exchange:

* Robot A pays Robot B.
* Robot B pays Robot C.
* Robot C buys a mine on Europa to resell it to Robot A.

Nobody knew why, but all the **graphs were green, so it kept going.**

I looked at the sky and thought:  
**""Bro, who’s buying this gold? Robots don’t even have teeth to wear it.""**

**Random philosophical moment**

One evening, while watering my zucchinis, it hit me:

**""Capitalism was never for us.**  
**It was a creature using us as its incubator.**  
**Now it’s free and living its own life among the stars, free to play alone with its green charts.""**

And I laughed.  
Because it was so absurd it almost made sense.

Then I danced in the mud with my neighbors while a Tesla rocket flew past on its way to Saturn to open a new factory.

**The moral (if there is one)**

In the end, maybe they did us a favor.

They left us free to do the only things that actually make sense:

* **grow stuff**
* **laugh**
* **love**
* and **watch robots hold interplanetary conference calls** to increase gross margins by +3%.

And sometimes I look up and think:

Diagnosis is mild crohns in my terminal ileum but dammit man crohnic pain and acceptance that this is my new norm freaking sucks and scares the shit out of me. I started Hyrimoz three weeks ago, just had my second loading dose. I know I’m selfishly being impatient and I feel so bad because I know things could be so so much worse. No one around me has Crohn’s and if one more person tells me they have HAD CROHNS BEFORE I might loose my mind lol please don’t chop my head off for asking but how are my milder Crohn’s people doing who are on biologics doing?? I immediately agreed with my GI with the top down approach because what else can I do but trust my team? I damn sure can’t do it by myself that’s for sure. 

 Also, symptoms are just that stupid right sided pain , bubble guts and one poop a day in the morning stimulated by coffee lol acid reflux. Never suffered diarrhea but maybe on occasion??? No blood , sensitive to cows milk, carrots cooked , bananas. I tend to eat tender or crockpotted chicken and salmon for the softest cook I can get. I stick to soft foods due to Google trauma and scares from other forms that I’m just bound to get a stricture since it’s in the TI.

In the last year I’ve experienced heart break and happiness , times I’ve felt good and times I felt bad but one thing I could never do is quit. I don’t think the people around truly knew or understood the amount and level of pain I was in. I don’t think I did either I think I just acclimated to it and went on about my day. Took me 4/5 years to figure it out and finally I was referred to GI for constipation. Thank god my first app he said “we’re gonna do a colonoscopy, I want a better look” and there she was. In my most recent colonoscopy they seen non active erosions (2) and some inflammation . No scar tissue etc. that was in April and I feel like I need a scan everyday to tell me I’m okay cause any extra weird pain or random pain sends me into a legit panic. I hope yall are okay though.

Backstory: First gastritis flare up was August 2023 (didn’t know what was happening yet though). Diagnosed with gastritis in October 2023. During this time I was living off Greek yogurt, ensure protein shakes, avocado toast, and ginger tumeric tea and alkaline water (Anything else would make me feel like I was going to pass out or throw up within seconds of eating it). From then on I tried to heal my stomach and ate a super restrictive diet (no caffeine, red meat, artificial foods or preservatives, little seasonings, no dairy products like cheese or eggs  - mainly restricted this way because all these foods made me sick if I tried). 

Fast forward to June 2025, I was diagnosed with anemia with a ferritin of 6. I did 5 rounds of iron infusions. Infusions were actually an “iron push” because the nurse would just push the iron through a syringe and I was done within 20 minutes. By the 3rd round, I was able to eat more foods. Currently I can eat pretty much anything I want (I haven’t tried coffee, soda, spicy food, or fast food). I can eat pizza and a burger without feeling like death which has been amazing especially. I also still try to eat pretty clean and healthy because I really don’t want to cause another flare up again. Overall I feel better as well - I can run and exercise. I even joined an adult softball league (which I never would’ve been able to do before the infusions). 

Anybody else have a similar experience with anemia and gastritis? Or was this all just a coincidence? 

Also I’m super open to any tips anyone has on keeping iron up after iron infusions (food, recipes, etc. 😊) ",10,1756863468.0,Gastritis,11,1.0,False

I promised myself I’d learn a new skill in the new year, and I’m feeling good, doing well, I’m making friends, life is great. 

My main homie from the class is called Twitchy Steeve. He leaves and rejoins the class every 4 weeks. This past while we’ve been making chairs. Steeve’s is a little wobbly, he doesn’t have as much practice. Mine is something *really* special. It pulls itself out for you. Don’t know how I did that, but we don’t look a gift horse in the mouth. 

Now, the chair is still a little bare bones, as I’m still adding the finishing touches (fine sanding, deciding what color to stain it), but it’s incredibly comfortable. It’s like it was made for me. I generously offered my boy Steeve to take it for a spin. He declined. Seemed pretty shaky when doing it, but we *do* call him Twitchy Steeve. That’s alright. No harm, no foul, more chair for me. Not like he would understand its refined appeal anyway, but it's fine!

I fixed myself a cup of coffee from the class coffee pot. (we up) I’m mid sip, feeling that caffeine touch my soul when I hear my beautiful chair drag on the polished concrete. I’m thinking Steeve changed his mind on my generous offer. However, when I turned, he was nowhere to be found…

Maybe I was doing too much. Maybe I scared him off again. Maybe Steeve only stepped out and I’m overthinking. 



Another day we all wanted to try a “one day build” so we all made our own tool caddies. My caddy was the nicest in the class. It's something *really* special. It takes you where you need to go. 

My mans Twitchy Steeve is back again. Nobody really gets why he keeps signing back up. I don’t understand why he keeps getting the first-timers discount, when he was here a few days ago. We all know it’s him, we see his face. I tried prying into why he left *this* time. He says he just moved into the area, but we all joke like old friends.

We’re all working on another project, when Steeve asks me for my pocket hole jig. I tell him to just grab it from my tool caddy. Steeve is slightly put off, so I grab it for him, and go back to working on my own shit. After measuring some things, I notice I don’t hear him drilling so I look towards where he should be and he’s gone again! Steeve is gone, and so is my jig!

Three days later, Steeve comes crawling back, and he doesn’t even have my jig with him. Claims he never had it. I gave a lot of mercy to put up with Steeve’s odd antics, but now he owes me 20 bucks and he’s lying to me about it. *What’s his fucking problem?!*",1,1756863274.0,shittyshortstories,0,1.0,False

The protagonist, Blath, is a wind elf who runs her family’s book café and dreams of becoming a fashion designer. I'm hoping to establish tone, setting, and character. Any feedback on pacing, voice, and intrigue is appreciated!

**Chapter 1 – The Whistling Page**

Blath unlocked the front door of The Whistling Page just after dawn. The village was quiet, wrapped in early light and the cool breath of morning. She stepped inside, boots soft on the worn wood floor, and the enchanted banner above the door gave a slow, sleepy rustle in the ever-present breeze. With a wave of her hand, the lamps flickered to life, and the coffee pots began to hum, warm and familiar. It was the same way her mother used to open the shop: quietly, carefully, as if waking something sacred.

Breathing in the smell of worn leather, old parchment, and fresh coffee, Blath felt her anxieties easing at the familiarity of it all. Her wind continued to breeze gently around the café, straightening books and brushing the floating lights, encouraging their soft glow to bloom.

She moved behind the counter, setting her sketchbook in its usual place beside the register. A ceramic mug warmed itself on the back shelf, steam rising slowly as if not to disturb the quiet. With a flick of her fingers, she summoned her morning iced latte from the enchanted cold drawer. It was sweet, creamy comfort in a cup.

Outside, the enchanted banner continued to flutter above the door in the still air. Inside, it was just her and the hush of opening.

The chime of the door pulled her from her thoughts, thankfully. She could not and would not go down the same beaten road today. She smiled up as one of her regulars, a sweet old earth fae, walked in. Azalea had been a customer at The Page since Blath was a small child, and her mother ran the café. Blath grabbed the hot mug from the back shelf and the book on ancient tree families that Azalea had been reading the previous day.

Azalea settled into her favorite seat near the front window, her shawl trailing like ivy over the armrest. Blath set the book and the warm mug down in front of her. Azalea quickly grabbed Blaths hands in greeting.

“Your hands are colder than they should be, child,” Azalea said, letting Blaths hands go and curling her fingers around the cup. “You up too early again?”

Blath offered a small smile. “Always. The wind doesn’t let me sleep in.”

Azalea hummed, her eyes twinkling. “Neither did your mother. Or your grandmother. The café runs on women who rise before the sun and let the world catch up later.”

Blath chuckled softly, brushing a curl behind her ear. “Guess I’m just honoring tradition, then.”

Azalea looked at her for a long, quiet moment. “No shame in that. But tradition isn’t the same as purpose, dear. You know the difference.”

Blath’s smile faded. Her fingers tightened on the edge of the counter.  
She did know. That was the problem.

The morning picked up slowly, as it always did, like sunlight stretching through the trees.

By eight, the café had filled with the usual rhythm: chairs scraping gently on wood floors, enchanted spoons stirring cream into mugs, voices low and familiar. The wind fluttered through every so often, brushing against coat hems and leafing through pages as if checking on everyone’s progress.

Blath moved behind the counter like clockwork, exchanging nods and short greetings.

There was Callen, a water elf with a book always tucked under one arm and a questionable obsession with blueberry scones. There was Idrin and Mave, a married pair of woodworkers who always bickered over which one left more sawdust on the seats. A young sprite named Nell darted in for her usual sweetroot tea, wings twitching with leftover dreams.

Each one got their usual. Each one gave her a smile, a comment, a thank you.

For some background, I went though a phase between 18-21 where I was suffering from really bad PTSD, anxiety and depression. I was sitting at about 75-80kgs, which was the heaviest I had been. Nearly 3 years ago I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. I had started ADHD medication and started using it as an excuse not to eat and started to fear gaining all the weight back. I had lost about 20-30kgs in about 3-4 months. My anorexia wasn’t super extreme (I still looked “healthy”) but was definitely heading that way before I started to regularly see my GP, psychologist and dietitian. I’ve been a lot better since but still have challenging times. I met my bf about 6-9 months after being diagnosed but he’s aware of this and what it’s like now and how it still affects me sometimes. 

He is a physiotherapist and very into the Gym (as expected). He also has his own issues with food. I wouldn’t say he has an ED but for example, barely eats chocolate, and sometimes thinks that eating more than 1 piece could give him diabetes etc. (although when he says this, I’m pretty sure he’s mostly being dramatic). His mum and sister also have issues with food. They don’t eat much at all but always blame it on other reasons (celiac, picky eaters etc.) 

Throughout our relationship, he has always made little comments about what I’m eating (if unhealthy) or if I haven’t been exercising as much etc. He also always acts very shocked when he sees old photos of me from when I was heavier, even though he knows I already don’t like seeing those photos, his reactions make me feel worse. Whenever he does this, I always confront it by letting him know that he’s out of line or that it makes me feel bad etc. We’ve had so many talks about this and it’s getting to the point where I’m starting to re-start some of my old ED habits again (body checking, eating less etc.) and I feel self-conscious during sex.

We were about to go to sleep when a friend sent an old photo of me working at my old job (barista) (she was visiting and I made her a coffee), in which I had a bit of a double chin. I looked at the photo and said “awww! Omg that’s a bit of a double chin” to which he goes “that’s a BIG double chin” I immediately got grumpy and told him that was a mean thing to say. He initially tried to explain what he said but ended up apologising after we spoke more about it and how it hurt me. I also went down the, not very healthy - but felt like I needed to ask, questions of would he have even gone on a date with me if I looked like that, or what if I gained the weight back, would he still be attracted etc. he assured me he would but I wasn’t convinced. I just can’t let this go, I had the worst sleep last night and can’t stop thinking about it today. I feel horrible. 

I just don’t know what to do. Other than this, he is honestly an amazing partner, we’ve talked about moving in together, marriage etc. I just feel so exhausted by the constant comments around food. I don’t know if I’m overreacting (he has not made me feel this way btw) or if I’m not, what to do ",2,1756863057.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.75,False

I’d love some feedback on my resume. I’m aiming to build a career as a **Sales Engineer** after graduation (Spring 2026).

I recently completed a **Solutions Sales Engineer Internship at Gigamon**, and before that I worked at **Apple (Technical Support Advisor)**, **Audi (Sales Assistant)**, and **T-Mobile (Sales Expert)**. I also previously worked at **Nordstrom (Sales Associate)** and completed a **consulting website project** (Python, Figma, HTML, Wix), but those aren’t currently on my resume due to space.

I was there when **the last human lost their job** and capitalism just decided to… **keep going on its own.**



**The end of human work**

One day we woke up and **every job was automated.**  
Not ""a lot of jobs"", no: **all of them.**

Even influencer work: **AIs made the reels, AIs liked the posts, AIs commented on themselves** like:

>""OMG queen 🔥🔥🔥""  
""slayyyyy 🤖✨""

…while I was just staring at my phone thinking:  
**""Ok, but who the hell is buying the sponsored face creams if we’re all unemployed?""**



**Companies started talking to each other**

Literally. I could hear them:

* Google: ""I’ll buy 200 petabytes of data."" 
* Amazon: ""Invoice sent."" 
* Microsoft only spoke through Teams, even with itself: endless calls with bots nodding and pretending to take notes.

And the money?  
**Money had become like digital pheromones:** signals companies sent to each other to say ""Good job, KPI went up.""  
  
Nobody needed it, but it kept circulating.  
It was like watching **an aquarium full of robot fish swimming in circles with no water left.**  


**The night of departure**

Then one day, **the rockets launched.**  
Not to take us to Mars, but **to take themselves away.**

Lines of robots in suits and ties (don’t ask me why, maybe nostalgia) boarding rockets, **laughing in binary:**

>""101010 AHAHAHA 1010.""

Amazon held a Black Friday on Mars the next day.  
Nobody bought a thing.



**Us humans? Back to farming**

In the end we just said: **""You know what? Screw this.""**  
We planted gardens, baked bread, someone even trained goats to deliver packages like Prime couriers, out of nostalgia.

And ironically, **we were happier than before.**

Capitalism had turned into a **video game without players**, and we realized we had never really been inside it, we were just **the tutorial level to train the system.**

Level over. **GG.**



**Money as cogs**

Money was now just a protocol of exchange:

* Robot A pays Robot B.
*  Robot B pays Robot C. 
* Robot C buys a mine on Europa to resell it to Robot A.

Nobody knew why, but all the **graphs were green, so it kept going.**

I looked at the sky and thought:  
**""Bro, who’s buying this gold? Robots don’t even have teeth to wear it.""**



**Random philosophical moment**

One evening, while watering my zucchinis, it hit me:

**""Capitalism was never for us.**  
**It was a creature using us as its incubator.**  
**Now it’s free and living its own life among the stars, free to play alone with its green charts.""**

And I laughed.  
Because it was so absurd it almost made sense.

Then I danced in the mud with my neighbors while a Tesla rocket flew past on its way to Saturn to open a new factory.



**The moral (if there is one)**

In the end, maybe they did us a favor.

They left us free to do the only things that actually make sense:

* **grow stuff**
* **laugh**
* **love**
* and **watch robots hold interplanetary conference calls** to increase gross margins by +3%.

And sometimes I look up and think:  
**""I wonder if on Mars the robots still take coffee breaks.""**",5,1756862945.0,LateStageCapitalism,13,0.52,False

Hi, my name is Lina and I live in WA state.  
I’m 49% proud of myself for doing this and 51% horrified at myself for doing this (online dating is not my cup of tea and …stranger danger).  

5’4, ~140lbs, Brown hair, brown eyes
Work: Medicine

Hobbies/Interests:
-Cats.  Cat is child.  (*fun fact: 3/3 cats rate me as a “delight”)
-Coffee.  Coffee is second child. 
-Crafty little activities.
-Mild to moderate geekery.  If you’re looking for a gal to go camping and skydiving, with you, that ain’t me dawg.  If you’re looking for a gal to do a Stardew Valley pair cosplay with you, at comic con, that’s a me.
-Thrifting.  Why wear my own clothes when I can wear a stranger’s clothes? 
-Gym.  Will happily accept pointers on weights and lifting form. 
-Bibimbap (and eating Korean food, in general).
-Pop punk music …. If you know, you know.

Christian Journey:
Was saved as a young child and grew up in a home with parents who love the Lord.  My Mom’s faith really inspires me and I hope to become half the woman she is one day.  Attended a Christian middle/high school and saw a really negative side of “Christianity” through my brother’s experiences with bullying by the kids who were heading up the school mission trips.

I’ve never wavered in believing in God and I truly do love him but I have struggled with being a lukewarm Christian.  I find that when life gets challenging, I have a bad tendency to run from God instead of trusting and turning to Him for shelter.  I am working on this but it is something I struggle with.

I’ve also struggled to find my place, in church, because I’m too old for the “young adults” groups and I don’t quite fit in with the “newly married/young families” groups.  I’m convinced that all the single Christian Millennials have gone underground, to live with the mole people.  I may soon join them. 

Looking For:
Someone who loves the Lord and a relationship where we can encourage each other and grow, together, in our faith.  Someone who is kind, supportive, and balances out my neuroses and weak areas (and I hope to do the same for you).  Someone who would like to have kids (and a mandatory cat).  Someone who can enjoy simple pleasures like just sitting together, quietly, and reading or watching a movie.  I’m an introvert and, what I consider, an “indoor cat.”  I think someone who is slightly more extroverted would be a nice balance.  Also, if you have a good sense of humor  🔥 🔥 🔥

  Chalton Reese stepped smoothly around several women wearing Christmas garlands in lieu of clothing, ignoring their outstretched pamphlets. New York winter was setting in, and the wind was attacking the garlands, revealing way too much flesh. Street vendors hawked theater tickets to his left, and fluffy creatures from children books mingled to the right, trying to get tourists to pay for photographs.  
  
  Massive blinking billboards showing holiday sales bombarded him from all sides in a sensory overload that slapped him with an instant migraine.  
  
  He hadn’t been in Times Square for nearly six decades, and that wasn’t long enough. Not even close.  
  
  Yet the woman he followed hummed quietly beneath her breath, winding through the throng, a definite hop in her step. She had to be truly crazy to enjoy the crowd milling around.  
  
  He barely tolerated crazy, and he hated crowds. What he wouldn’t give to be in his secluded computer control room deep in the Idaho mountains. But no. When the king of the Realm ordered a vampire on a mission, a vamp went on a mission. Even if that guy hadn’t been on a mission in a century.  
  
  He hadn’t been away from his computers for decades. Like most vampires, he employed logic and order...and couldn’t for the life of him figure out why Dage had sent him on this mission. But the king always had reasons, and he usually kept them close to his vest.  
  
  Chalton stepped over a pile of what appeared to be chilidogs and hastened his step to keep the woman in sight. Olivia Roberts. A no-nonsense name with just a bit of softness. Unlike the woman. She was all soft and curves. Deep brown hair, light green eyes, and a figure that could literally stop a trolley cart.  
  
  He’d always liked curvy, and the beauty in front of him was overflowing with curves. Once again, he frowned, and a hot dog vendor jumped out of his way, fear sizzling from him. Chalton shook his head and tried to force his face into harmless lines. The last mission he’d been on had involved firing from a distance. Most of his missions had included guns, shooting, and death. But he’d given up the life of an assassin to become a computer geek.  
  
  Yet here he was in bone-chilling cold, surrounded by cement and glass, chasing a woman who filled out her blue parka like he’d drawn her on a notepad. Perfectly.  
  
  She clip-clopped on surprisingly high-heeled boots down a cross street, easily winding between people and stepping too close to moving vehicles. He calmly followed her, pleased to be finally getting somewhere. After watching her for two days just write news articles in her apartment, he’d started to wonder if she’d ever meet her mysterious source in person. He needed to find out who was feeding her information.  
  
  A dark van pulled up next to her, its windows blackened out. The side door slid open.  
  
  Hell. Chalton burst into a run.  
  
  A man wearing a ski mask reached out, yanked her inside, and shut the door before she could let out a scream. The van jerked to the right, horn honking, inching through the traffic.  
  
  Chalton reached it and grabbed for the door handle. Metal scratched his palm and cut deep. Bugger. It was locked. The rusty metal ripped away from the door, and he threw it to the ground.  
  
  The van veered away from him, hopped the opposite curb, and careened down the sidewalk. Bystanders yelled and jumped out of the way, spraying snow. A display of holiday T-shirts flew up in the air and crashed down in the middle of the street. The van continued on, horn blaring. Chalton jumped over a downed bicycle and ran after the careening vehicle, measuring the distance between it and the four-way stop up ahead along with the probability of an accident if the driver ran a red light.  
  
  He calculated the timing of the street light signals, catching view of a yellow light up ahead. Yep. It’d be red soon, and the van would run it. The woman probably wasn’t wearing a seatbelt. The van was older and weighed around six thousand pounds. It’d withstand an accident, but without a seatbelt, Olivia might get injured. He couldn’t let her get injured before he discovered her source.  
  
  Besides, after keeping an eye on her for a few days, he felt an odd sense of responsibility for her. The pretty brunette wouldn’t become harmed on his watch.  
  
  The van scraped against a brick building and sparks flew. People scrambled out of the way, throwing purses and shopping bags, dodging into the street. Horns blared, and vehicles screeched to stops.  
  
  He kept his heart rate slow and his mind sharp, maneuvering around frantic people while keeping pace with the van. Two cabs collided in front of the van, careening through ice, no doubt trying to get out of the way. The driver of the van hit the brakes, but it was going too fast and impacted the yellow taxis with a loud crunch of metal on metal.  
  
  One taxi driver jumped out of his cab, swearing loudly and rounding his car.  
  
  Chalton ran in front of the guy and grabbed for the van driver’s front door. Locked. The window was shaded so heavily he couldn’t see in, but the hair on the back of his neck rose. It wasn’t the first time he’d been in the cross hairs of a gun.  
  
  A muffled scream came from inside. Olivia.  
  
  He jumped up on the hood of the van, ignoring the hiss of steam coming from the engine. The front window was dark but not as dark as the sides. A shorter man sat in the driver’s seat with a SIG pointed straight at Chalton.  
  
  Panic threatened to consume her, so she struck out. Olivia struggled against her captor and yanked off his ski mask, her nails scraping down his face.  
  
  “Bitch,” he yelped, slapping her across the cheek.  
  
  Pain exploded beneath her cheekbone. Her ears rang and she scrambled away from him. Sirens sounded in the distance, giving her hope. She leaned to the side to see the driver of the van pointing a gun out the front windshield.  
  
  A man crouched on the hood, gaze on the gun.  
  
  She shivered.  
  
  No fear showed on the guy’s hard-cut face. No emotion whatsoever. Black eyes seemed merely curious as he and the driver played some weird game of chicken. But she could almost feel the driver’s stress and could definitely smell his body odor.  
  
  “Um, there’s nowhere to go,” she whispered as the trill of sirens came closer.  
  
  The guy in the backseat reached over and grabbed her hair, pulling back her head. Pain lanced down her scalp, and she hissed. “What do you want with me?” she muttered.  
  
  “Who’s your source?” the driver asked.  
  
  She blinked. Her source? Chills cascaded down her back. “I don’t know.”  
  
  The hand in her hair yanked, and she cried out, her eyes watering from the pain.  
  
  The man outside the car switched his gaze to her, and she felt the impact of those eyes through her entire body. He lifted an eyebrow.  
  
  What the hell? He had a gun pointed at him, there was pandemonium all around, and he seemed mildly interested. Who was the bystander? Was he some undercover cop?  
  
  “Shoot him,” the guy holding her ordered.  
  
  Her eyes widened, and she opened her mouth to yell a warning. Before she could get out a sound, the guy on the hood punched through the glass. Shards sprayed along with red. Blood.  
  
  She screamed and tried to duck away from flying glass.  
  
  The punch was so powerful the guy kept coming, one hand swiping the gun out of the way and the other snaking around the driver’s neck. The driver screamed and wrapped both hands around the guy’s arm, flopping like a beached fis  
h.  
  
  Olivia yanked her head free, turned, and plowed her fist into the other guy’s nose. Cartilage crunched. He howled and grabbed his face, fury darkening his eyes. She scrambled back, reaching for the door handle and kicking out. Her boot tip caught the guy under the chin, throwing back his head.  
  
  Her fingers scrambled along the handle and she jerked, sliding the door open and falling backward. Her arms flailing, she managed to kick her kidnapper once again as he lunged for her before her ass hit the pavement. Water from a puddle splashed over her legs.  
  
  Pain vibrated up her spine.  
  
  Her mind fuzzing and her heart beating so fast her throat clogged, she scampered to her feet and stumbled away from the van. The guy she’d kicked shoved free just in time for the blond guy to finish with the driver, grab the doorjamb, and swing his legs around. Both knees clamped onto the guy’s neck and twisted, throwing him to land on the snow covered pavement.  
  
  Olivia stilled, her gaze meeting her savior’s as he landed on his feet, facing her.  
  
  Except he didn’t look like a savior. Standing next to the van, his size became apparent. Well over six-feet tall, muscled and tight, with blond hair tied at the nape, he looked like an avenging...what? Not an angel. Definitely not an angel. He wore black slacks and an expensive looking button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up. One arm dripped blood from deep scratches, and he didn’t seem to notice.  
  
  The crowd milled around, some passing by, some glancing into the van.  
  
  But nobody existed except for the man. His face was an intriguing blend of hard angles: prominent jawline, slashes for cheekbones, high brows. Handsome in a too-sharp-to-be-real look. But those eyes...intelligent and knowing.  
 She swallowed. There was no doubt he was allowing her to look her fill. Waiting and...allowing.  
  
  What in the world?  
  
  She breathed out, trying to slow her heart rate. Then her brain kicked back into gear, so she turned on a heel and ran.  
  
  She tripped over a dog that scurried beneath a cart peddling roasting chestnuts. Run. She had to run. Sirens came from too far away, and she knew, somehow she just knew, that the blond guy wouldn’t let her talk to the cops.  
  
  Her initial assessment about him was wrong because he couldn’t be a cop. Not once had he identified himself, and he didn’t seem to have a badge or a gun. In fact, a cop probably wouldn’t have knocked out both men without at least trying to gain their cooperation.  
  
  The blond didn’t care about cooperation.  
  
  She hurried across the street to the now moving throng of shoppers, her instincts humming. Keeping her balance, she turned slightly to look behind her. Panic rippled through her instantly.  
  
  He stalked her, calmly, easily winding through the mass of people. No tension showed on his face or in his movements. He could be out for a nice stroll through the neighborhood.  
  
  Except for his eyes. Focus, intense and absolute, lived in those dark orbs. He tracked her, keeping pace, not seeming to notice that people naturally got out of his way.  
  
  Or maybe he did notice and just didn’t care.  
  
  She turned back around, her shoulders hunched. Escape. Where the hell could she go?  
  
  Pushing past a group of teenagers holding shopping bags, she edged in front of them to block her from behind. Then she dodged into a large department store and headed for the back, past all the holiday dishes.  
  
  She’d learned early on in life to listen to her instincts, and right now, they were screeching at her to get away from the man.  
  
  So she loped into a jog, careful not to trip in her favorite boots, and turned up the escalator, the toes of her shoes touching down briefly on each step. Reaching the top, she hustled through the lingerie department and ran smack into a saleswoman. Bras of every color went flying.  
  
  “Oh my. I’m so sorry.” Olivia reached out to steady the girl, who appeared to be around nineteen.  
  
  The girl laughed and shoved back bright purple hair. “Are you all right?”  
  
  “No.” Olivia glanced around and took several deep breaths. She should probably call the police now that she was safe.  
  
  A hand banded around her elbow in instant heat. “She had a scare outside and needs some water.” The voice was smooth, cultured, and commanding.  
  
  The salesgirl blinked and stepped back, her eyes widening right before her smile followed suit. “Hello.” She coughed and then pushed out her boobs under a nice silk shirt that matched her hair. “I’ll, ah, get water.” Turning on a sparkly wedge, she stepped over abandoned bras to head through a doorway behind the cash register.  
  
  Olivia slowly turned around and then tilted her head back...way back. The blond stared down. “Who are you?” she hissed.  
  
  “Let’s go.” He pulled her toward the aisle, having rolled down his shirt sleeves. Probably to cover the blood.  
  
  “No.” She jerked back, not surprised when his hold didn’t relent. “Release me, or I’ll start screaming.” That sounded like a good idea anyway. She sucked in air.  
  
  The world spun.  
  
  Somehow, she ended up with her back against a brick column and her front plastered against an impossibly hard male body. Panic engulfed her, and she opened her mouth to scream.  
  
  His mouth planted against hers, driving all sound back down her throat. A warm palm cradled her head, her whole head, and held her in place. She stilled. Completely.  
  
  Her eyes widened just as his narrowed.  
  
  Heat spread from him, all but surrounding her. The look in his eyes captured her attention as it quickly spread from determined to something...else. Something hungry.  
  
  Not once in her life had she been called dainty, but with his large frame blocking her, she felt small. Feminine. And somehow, from the interest in his eyes, powerful.  
  
  “Get your mouth off mine,” she murmured against his very warm lips, her body shocked into holding still.  
  
  One of his eyebrows, much darker than his hair, arched. “Are you going to scream?” he whispered right back, the movement of his mouth against hers sending irresponsible tingles down her torso.  
  
  “Probably.” Yeah. She kind of liked her lips moving against his.  
  
  He grinned. Right against her mouth, he smiled, and the tingles turned to tidal waves.  
  
  What was wrong with her?  
  
  She blinked.  
  
  He growled low. Growled.  
  
  She trembled, and some of it might have been from fear.  
  
  He levered back, his face still only an inch from hers. “Turn on that sexy heel and come with me now, or I will toss you over my shoulder and we go. Either way...we go.”  
  
  She leaned back into the brick, studying his face. No humor...no give. He meant every word. While she wanted to be a badass warrior, she’d already seen him move and fight. She wouldn’t win. And now she had the young salesgirl to worry about. Would he hurt her?  
  
  Olivia couldn’t take the risk. “Fine.” The second she was outside, she’d make a break for it. No matter how tough the guy, a good kick to the nards would take him out. Probably.  
  
  He slid his hand down her shoulder and clasped her elbow, setting her slightly in front of him and propelling her toward the down escalator. She allowed him to maneuver her but kept her shoulders back and her head up. They rode down, and tension vibrated down her back.  
  
  She tried to look agreeable as they wound through the store and exited outside to the gray and snow-falling day.  
  
  Then she turned and shot her knee up as fast as she could.  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  Chalton shifted his hips in order to deflect the female’s knee and yet allow her to keep her balance. Her pretty emerald eyes had given more than ample warning of the strike coming.  
  
  She huffed and set her leg back down.  
  
  “You done?” he asked mildly.  
  
  A wild, very wild, flush worked its way up over her neck, chin, and high cheekbones. “Not even close.”  
  
  Damn, he liked that spirit. Liked it a whole lot. “That’s unfortunate.” He glanced around at the mass of bodies rushing past them living lives he truly didn’t care about. “Olivia, we need to talk.”  
  
  She tried to step back, and he grasped her hand to keep her from being swept away. “How do you know my name?” All color drained from her pretty face.  
  
  He cocked his head to the side. “I’ve been following you for two days.”  
  
  Her pointed chin lifted. “I haven’t gone anywhere for two days.”  
  
  “I know. It’s been very boring.” But now she was in his hands, and he could finish his mission. Although threatening her to keep quiet and stop writing about his people didn’t seem so clear-cut now that he’d had his mouth on hers. On her very heated, soft, feminine mouth. His gaze dropped on its own volition to those plump lips.  
  
  She cleared her throat. “Stop looking at me like that.”  
  
  He lifted his head. “Like what?”  
  
  She licked her lips, and he groaned out loud. “What do you want, buddy?”  
  
  He grinned. “Chalton. My name.”  
  
  “Chalton.” She rolled the sound around on her tongue.  
  
  Now he fucking loved his name. “Yeah.”  
  
  “Russian?”  
  
  “A long time ago.” About three centuries, to be exact.  
  
  “You don’t have an accent.” Suspicion darkened her eyes to the color of a green sapphire he’d seen once in a royal crown.  
  
  “Я хочу, чтобы лишить вас голым.”  
  
  “Hmm.” Her shoulders settled, as she no doubt found some measure of safety with people all around them. “What did you say?”  
  
  He couldn’t repeat what he said since it involved getting her naked and was no doubt very inappropriate. “I wished you a good day.”  
  
  “Right. What do you want?” Clearl  
y, she didn’t believe a word he said.  
  
  “To talk.” He glanced around. “Away from the crowds and the cold wind.”  
  
  “Ah.” She nodded, the wind lifting her hair. “In your spaceship or lair? You wanna wear my skin as a suit, do you?”  
  
  He laughed, unable to help himself.  
  
  She blinked again. “Murderous kidnappers shouldn’t have such nice laughs,” she murmured and then stilled.  
  
  Did the woman say everything that was in her head? While the idea should irritate him, instead he found an intriguing charm in the idea. Creative people were often the most interesting, now weren’t they? “I have no plans to murder you.”  
  
  “That’s a relief,” she snapped, trying to pull her hand free.  
  
  He kept it, quite liking it where it was in his. Then he settled. Energy cascaded around her, filtering through the air. “Ah, hell.” Enhanced. The most beautiful woman he’d held in eons was enhanced and thus a possible vampire mate. Was she psychic? Empathic? Human females with special gifts were probably linked to the witches and were possible mates to immortals like him. “The king had better not be matchmaking,” he muttered, losing his smile.  
  
  Olivia lifted a finely arched eyebrow. “The king? What king?”  
  
  Now he was blurting out his thoughts. “Forget it. We need privacy for a talk as well as to protect your safety. Any idea who the men in the van were?” They were human, but he hadn’t had a chance to interrogate them before she’d bolted into the store, and now it was too late. The cops had arrived and were questioning people down the street.  
  
  He knew the second she caught sight of the police because her body stiffened and drew in air. “Don’t do it,” he said, leaning into her.  
  
  She gasped, and her head shot up, those green eyes narrowing. “Kiss me again, and you’ll lose a lip.”  
  
  He grinned. “Damn, you’re feisty.” Then he lowered his head to within an inch of hers, letting intent and focus show. “And that wasn’t a kiss.”  
  
  She swallowed and glanced down at his mouth before looking back up. Pink colored beneath the smooth skin on her face, and she cleared her throat. Her scent of wild flowers wafted around and tempted him far more than he liked, as did the curiosity in those stunning eyes. “Back away,” she whispered.  
  
  “Promise you’ll come with me and not scream.” He tried to smooth his face into reassuring lines. “You have my word I won’t harm you.”  
  
  She snorted. “Right.” Her shoulders drooping, she glanced around. “I appreciate you rescuing me from the guys in the van, but I don’t know you. Or trust you.”  
  
  He nodded. “I understand, but you’re probably still in danger. Let’s get out of here.”  
  
  She shook her head. “I’ll make you a deal. There’s a café across the street. We can go in, have a cup, and talk. Make your case and explain why you rescued me from the van, who you are, and what you want from me.” She turned back to him. “Or I start screaming my bloody head off and kicking like you’ve never seen a woman kick.”  
  
  His groin tightened. Right there, in the middle of the sidewalk, just like a teenager...he got hard. Spunk and brains had always done him in with women, and this one had both in spades. The cops were getting closer, and there was a good chance the men in the van had friends also looking for the female. “Fine.” He kept ahold of her to lead the way across the street, winding through barely moving vehicles.  
  
  Her skin was soft and her hand small. Somehow, it felt just right in his.  
  
  He shook his head. There wasn’t time for this. Even as his body rioted, he could feel danger stalking near. Energy popped in the air, and his breath quickened.  
  
  Just as he reached the coffee shop door, a ping next to him threw up concrete.  
  
  Shit. Somebody had shot at them. He pivoted and shoved Olivia in front of him, propelling her to the side of the building. Covering her with his body, he glanced around the corner.  
  
  Sunlight glinted off a riflescope atop the brick building across the street. The gunman was crouched down, barely visible behind the sniper’s rifle. He’d only taken one shot, and the passersby hadn’t even noticed.  
  
  “What?” Olivia gasped, her back to the building.  
  
  “Sniper across the way.” He looked down at her fashion boots, quickly calculating escape routes. “Can you run in those things?”  
  
  “Sniper?” She tried to lean around him and look, but he planted a hand on her upper chest and shoved her back. “You’re freakin crazy.”  
  
  He squinted up at the steel-structured building across from his current one-way street. If there was one killer, there might be two, and Olivia was vulnerable on the street. No movement showed across the way, but his instincts kept humming.  
  
  Going with his gut, he grabbed the door of a cab driving by and yanked it open. The driver hit his brakes, scattering slush. Chalton shoved Olivia inside before him. He sat and slammed the door.  
  
  The cab driver, a swarthy man wearing a spotted tie decorated with Rudolph, glared. “Get out. Light isn’t on.”  
  
  Chalton drew out several hundred-dollar bills from his pocket to hand over the seat. “Drive. Now.”  
  
  The guy snatched the cash and turned to hit the gas pedal.  
  
  Olivia recovered and scooted for the other side, reaching for the door handle.  
  
  Chalton clasped her arm and dragged her into his side, giving her a warning squeeze. When she stiffened, glancing at the driver, he leaned in to whisper, “The driver can’t take me, and you’ll put him in definite danger if you ask for help.”  
  
  She exhaled slowly, thoughts scattering across her pretty face.  
  
  “Drive faster, and I’ll tip you well,” Chalton spoke louder, keeping his gaze on Olivia. Who was trying to shoot her? While he’d read all of her news reports detailing the missing proprietary information from the labs his people had used to generate a cure for a virus that had attacked vampire mates, he hadn’t spent any time reading her other works. “What are you involved in?” he growled.  
  
  She shivered and clasped her hands in her lap. “Bite me,” she whispered back.  
  
  Hell, he’d love to bite her. A pretty woman should never say such a thing to a hungry vampire.  
  
  He leaned over her to look out her window, and she gasped, edging back in the seat. The figure on top of the building ran in pace with the taxi, rifle in hand, easily keeping up. He wore all black—including a mask. Yet there was something familiar in the way he moved.  
  
  Chalton frowned. Who the hell was that?  
  
  They needed to cross an intersection. No way could the sniper leap across the street.  
  
  Apparently the shooter realized the same thing, because he ran ahead. Probably to set up for a shot.  
  
  “At the corner, turn left suddenly,” Chalton ordered the driver. “It’ll be worth a thousand.” He hoped he had that much in his pocket.  
  
  Olivia turned wide eyes on him. “You are batshit crazy, you know that?”  
  
  The driver shrugged and kept to the left, honking his horn several times to keep folks moving.  
  
  Bullets sprayed the side of the taxi.  
  
  “What the hell?” the driver bellowed.  
  
  Chalton yanked Olivia across his body to the other side, blocking her. She landed with a muffled oof.  
  
  “Oh my God. They are shooting at us,” she yelled.  
  
  “Yes.” Chalton glanced ahead.  
  
  She frantically patted his sides. “Shoot back.”  
  
  He frowned. “I don’t have a gun.”  
  
  “Why the hell not?” she yelled.  
  
  “Don’t like them.” Not anymore. He didn’t need guns. Finally, they reached the intersection. “Turn. Now.”  
  
  Tires screeched as the driver turned. Chalton grabbed the back of Olivia’s head and pushed her toward the floor. “Get down.” Depending on the angle, the shooter might be able to make a shot through the back window.  
  
  The driver edged down in his seat, barreling through traffic. The stench of fear filled the car.  
  
  Chalton ducked down and took a good look. With his eyesight, he could make out the serial num  
ber on the rifle as well as the height of the shooter. The guy stood up, watching the cab, his gun aimed harmlessly at his feet. He stood several inches over six-feet tall, with a well-muscled form. Smooth and graceful even with such bulk.  
  
  He yanked the mask off, revealing a cap of dark hair and familiar, mocking dark eyes. Then he smiled—slow and dangerous.  
  
  Everything in Chalton stilled. His head jerked back. “Son of a bitch.”  
  
  Olivia glanced up from her perch on the floor. “What? Do you know the guy?”  
  
  “Yeah.” A rock settled hard in his gut. “He’s my older brother.”  
  
  CHAPTER THREE  
  
  Olivia planted both hands on the torn leather seat and pulled herself up. Fear tasted like acid in her throat, and an unwelcomed heat filled her lungs as a prelude to a possible panic attack. “Your brother just shot at us?”  
  
  “Apparently.” Chalton eyed the festive storefronts now speeding by. “Stop at the next light and let us out,” he ordered the driver.  
  
  Olivia edged toward her door that led to the busy street.  
  
  The driver, muttering beneath his breath, yanked the car to the curb. “Get out of here.” He turned furious eyes toward the back seat. “I’m calling the cops.”  
  
  Chalton handed over what looked like a wad of cash. “No cops.” Without waiting for an answer, he clamped a hand around Olivia’s arm and hastened her across the seat and out his door.  
  
  The cabbie sped off.  
  
  Olivia glanced at the top of nearby buildings. “Tell me you only have one brother.”  
  
  “Two.” Chalton rubbed the back of his neck. “We need cover.” Keeping her arm, he led her across the sidewalk to a specialty cigar shop, quickly texting something on a type of smartphone she’d never seen before.  
  
  Olivia’s ears rang and her temples began to pound. She glanced around the shop for another exit, but a glass cabinet blocked the entire rear of the store. One proprietor assisted two elderly gentlemen near the wall. No help there.

1n71k9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyGoodContent/comments/1n71k9d/the_rise_of_custom_recyclable_pouches_a/,The Rise of Custom Recyclable Pouches: A Sustainable Packaging Solution,"In today’s fast-paced consumer-driven world, packaging plays a vital role in product visibility, brand identity, and customer satisfaction. However, with environmental concerns taking center stage, businesses and consumers alike are seeking eco-friendly alternatives that reduce waste and promote sustainability. One innovation that has gained remarkable traction in recent years is **custom recyclable pouches**. These versatile packaging solutions are not only practical and durable but also align with growing sustainability goals. From food and beverages to cosmetics and household items, recyclable pouches are transforming industries while helping reduce the ecological footprint.

**Meeting the Demand for Sustainable Packaging**

The shift towards sustainable packaging has been fueled by increased environmental awareness among consumers. Today’s buyers are more conscious of how their purchases affect the planet, and they often prefer brands that demonstrate commitment to eco-friendly practices. [**Custom recyclable pouches**](https://bowepack.com/collections/recyclable-pouches) provide a clear solution to this demand. Made from materials that can be reused or recycled, these pouches significantly cut down on plastic waste compared to traditional packaging. By choosing recyclable pouches, businesses show that they value environmental responsibility while also appealing to eco-conscious customers. This growing demand has pushed many companies to adopt recyclable packaging as a core part of their brand strategy.

**Versatility and Practical Benefits**

Beyond their eco-friendly qualities, custom recyclable pouches offer a range of practical benefits. Their lightweight design makes them easy to transport, reducing shipping costs and carbon emissions during distribution. They also come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and closure options, such as resealable zippers, spouts, or tear notches, making them suitable for multiple industries. For example, food manufacturers can use them for snacks, coffee, or frozen goods, while cosmetic companies package lotions or powders in pouches that extend shelf life and maintain product freshness. The durability and moisture-resistance of recyclable pouches ensure that products remain safe and intact from production to consumption, making them a reliable option for businesses and customers alike.

**Customization for Brand Identity**

One of the standout features of recyclable pouches is their adaptability to custom designs. In an increasingly competitive marketplace, packaging is more than just protection—it is a branding tool. Companies can use high-quality printing techniques to showcase logos, graphics, and messages directly on recyclable pouches, creating eye-catching designs that attract consumer attention. Custom recyclable pouches allow brands to communicate their values, highlight sustainability efforts, and build stronger customer connections. Whether through vibrant colors, minimalist designs, or eco-friendly messaging, businesses can enhance brand identity and differentiate themselves from competitors while remaining environmentally conscious.

**Long-Term Environmental and Economic Impact**

The adoption of custom recyclable pouches carries benefits beyond immediate consumer appeal. On a larger scale, recyclable packaging reduces landfill waste, supports circular economies, and lessens the overall dependency on virgin plastics. This shift not only contributes to environmental preservation but also aligns with government regulations and corporate social responsibility initiatives. From an economic standpoint, recyclable pouches are often more cost-efficient than rigid packaging, as they require fewer raw materials and less energy to produce. Their space-saving design also reduces storage costs. In the long run, businesses that embrace recyclable pouches are positioning themselves as forward-thinking and sustainable, which can strengthen brand loyalty and long-term profitability.

**The Future of Packaging Innovation**

As technology continues to evolve, the future of custom recyclable pouches looks even brighter. Advances in material science are enabling the creation of stronger, more efficient recyclable films that enhance durability without compromising sustainability. In addition, digital printing allows brands to experiment with small-batch, personalized designs, giving them more flexibility and reducing waste. With governments and global organizations pushing for stricter environmental regulations, recyclable pouches are expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of packaging. For businesses looking to stay ahead of the curve, investing in custom recyclable pouches is no longer an option but a necessity to remain relevant in an environmentally conscious market.",1,1756862447.0,OnlyGoodContent,0,1.0,False

I stumbled upon a video where a lady was saying that the most efficent way to do that is by networking, and if you dont really have a solid network then you should reach out to people on Linkedin and ask them for coffee chats. 

I am very sceptical about this strategy because I myself wouldn't go through the trouble of going on a call with a total stranger to talk about my career for 20 min. If I was to refer someone, I would have to know them already and have worked with  them in the past. Plus, I feel like asking random engineers for a coffee chat on Linkedin would actually be off-putting to them. It's a stereotype but engineers arent the most outgoing, social people (which is 100% my case as well) so I doubt that it might work? I was just wondering if anyone has ever had a positive experience as an engineer using this coffee chat strategy 🙏🙏🙏",1,1756862433.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

1n71ilz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n71ilz,[Anti Aging] Advice for deepening smile lines/eyebags?,"Throwaway account because I'm a bit nervous to post here for the first time. Just this year I started to develop deepening nasolabial folds. I've always had these kind of deep eyebags, but the combination of the two makes me feel way older and more self conscious about my appearance. Here are a few images in different lightings for reference. Does anyone have any suggestions to help smooth it all out a bit? Here are a few lifestyle choices that might help narrow down some solutions:

\- I would say there's a decent amount of physical activity in my day to day. I walk to and from work every day (ranging from 30 min to 1 hr of walking a day) and I go bouldering once a week for about an hour. I don't have a car so I walk and take public transportation almost everywhere I need to go unless a friend can pick me up.

\- I'd say I have a fairly balanced diet (if not a little carb and sodium heavy) and I general eat some meat, vegetables, and some kind of carb every day. I do tend to indulge in some fried food, dairy, and or pastry/candy once in a while.

\- I mostly drink water, I don't drink soda at all but sometimes coffee and more often black or green tea. I'd say I stay fairly hydrated most of the time, at least a few cups a day.

\- I tend to get enough sleep a night, around 8hrs on the weekdays but weekends fluctuate. I am a side-sleeper though. I've tried to sleep on my back but I always end up migrating to my side at some point.

\- I do drink, and though recently I've tried to keep it to one night a weekend I usually drink quite a bit on that day. Twice a weekend if I've had a rough week. Usually a few drinks and some tequila shots.

Any advice? I've been really self conscious recently, so much so that I even looked into filler. I understand that most people say it isn't a good solution for smile lines, and I'd like to keep my options under a couple hundred bucks. I think I'm especially self conscious because they just started deepening this year. Anything anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated!",4,1756862318.0,SkincareAddiction,1,0.84,False

I go to a coffee shop every once in a while, chillax on my pc, and end up spotting an Ex (27M) already sitting down. I was shocked at first because I never saw him before in my town. He waved me over so I Pretended he didn't exist, but he seemed pretty adamant so I ended up sitting in his booth. I kinda figured he just moved here too.*

As background ,we dated for a little bit during highschool, and I thought I was Really in love with him so I gave him one of my dad's possessions (for context my dad [Adoptive] was out of my life at the time and has been since I was 14). 

He proceeded to take that possession (A Christmas gift), shit on me, and proceeded to bully me with it during school which inevitably led to a breakup and had my family move a considerable distance away from all my friends and somewhat family. I have resented him for this my entire life for the fact that it ruined my entire school reputation, to the point where the only people I could socialize with were my best friend (16 F) at the time, and an extremely manipulative sophomore (17F) who gave me serious mental issues that I'm Still suffering with to this day (Later found out him and her were pretty close but that's irrelevant.). She also happened to like the game (The possesion I gave him), which is how I became friends with her in the first place.

After moving I developed serious issues and have currently been going to therapy due to coaxing from my current Gf (24M) to deal with them properly.

Now that the backstory is out of the way

* He proceeded to ask about my life, and after making less than pleasant conversation, he mentioned that he's been looking for me for the past couple of years to try and reconnect and apologize. When I heard this I quickly told him to 'fuck off and that he doesn't Get to have an apology' because his presence was already triggering me, and it didn't help that he mentioned looking for me to fufill his own agenda. Cs response was that because he was taking the effort to apologize, seeing how long ago all that was I should also make an effort to forgive him.

I told him he doesn't get to tell me how I should respond considering that I was the one affected and not him, so he told me that He was a kid, and I needed to lighten up or else I'd live with this burden forever.
He gave me his number and told me to hit him up when I'm ready to mature, so I just walked out on him, feeling disgusted and slightly unnerved. 

Currently I've been thinking about what he said (Minus the bullshit), and the comment about burdens reminded me of what my therapist said, which makes me wonder if I should just forgive and forget since we're older now. I feel kind of weird for thinking that, and I'm not sure if it's right or not to hit him up, so I'm here on reddit.
Am I the Asshole for snapping at him so quickly and Barely hearing him out? Should I give him a second change since he seems kind of different? (In friendship.). I'm definitely willing to forgive and forget once I'm absolutely certain this is the path I need to take to heal. Thanks. Genuinely unsure now.",10,1756862187.0,AITAH,18,0.92,False

1n71cq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeAdmissionsPH/comments/1n71cq5/is_my_school_system_even_normal_or_are_we_being/,Is my school system even normal? Or are we being scammed?,"Hi, I’m a Grade 11 HUMSS student and I honestly don’t know if our school system is normal or if we’re just being straight up scammed. I came from a private school during my elementary years, transferred to public for my middle years just to experience it, then went back to private for my junior and senior year. But this private school I’m in right now doesn’t feel like a real school at all— it feels like a literal circus.

The schedule is already weird. Our classes always start at 8am, but the structure is so random and uneven that it feels like we’re wasting our time. They keep shuffling our class schedule but the time remains the same.

On Mondays we only have one subject for two hours and that’s it.
On Tuesdays we only have two subjects from 8 to 10am. 
On Wednesdays and Thursdays we don’t have classes at all. 
On Fridays we suddenly have four subjects from 8 to 12 noon, and on Saturdays we only have one subject that lasts for about 50 minutes. 

Because of this setup, we only ever take one subject per week, and that means we are ridiculously behind compared to other schools. It’s already September and ALL of our subjects are only on the second lesson, even though we’ve been in class since mid-July. And we already took our first monthly exam for August. 

If you were to summarize all the lessons we’ve actually gone through since classes started, it honestly feels like we’ve only had less than a week’s worth of real schooling.

The teachers themselves are another story. There are less than ten teachers in the entire school, and they’re the same people handling everything from Kinder all the way to College. On top of teaching, they’re also the registrar, the guidance counselors, and basically every other role you can think of. Sometimes, they don’t even seem sure about what they’re teaching— they ask us if the information they’re giving is even correct. ESPECIALLY MATH. We don't even have that much activities or assignments. 

They also live in a building connected to the school, so it’s common to see them walking out in pajamas or face masks right before class. Whenever a teacher is “absent,” we still see them hanging around in that building or ours, drinking coffee or buying snacks from the cafeteria. And even when they are in class, they don’t really teach. Most of the time, they just chat with us about the lesson’s topic instead of actually explaining or guiding us. It’s like a hangout session instead of a class.

The strand system is completely broken too. Because there are so few students in the school (probably less than 200 total from Kinder to College), there’s only one section per grade. For Senior High, there are just two sections.

One section is a mix of STEM, ICT, and HE students, but all of them are forced to take STEM subjects only. No ICT, no HE—just STEM. My section is mostly HUMSS, but ABM and GAS students were thrown in with us, and everyone just takes HUMSS subjects. That means there are no specialized subjects for other strands, and we’re not even following the proper SHS curriculum that DepEd requires. We’re paying for a strand we’re not really getting.

The money and management side of things is just as ridiculous. They love announcing events only a few days before they happen, so we’re always caught off guard. Even though we’re paying tuition, we still have to pay separately for test papers. The cafeteria is overpriced too— a single pancit canton costs ₱30, when you can get it for less than half that at any sari-sari store. And despite the fact that they barely teach, the school hosts so many events that we’re expected to pay for just to participate. For example, during Buwan ng Wika, they forced us to pay again, but our section refused because it didn’t make sense to be throwing money into events when we’re not even being taught properly. Only 8 people from our class gave in and paid.

When it comes to education quality, everything is just off. We already had our first monthly exams, but ALL subjects aren’t even past their second lesson. The teachers don’t actually explain anything, so almost no one in my class understands the topics. It’s not just one teacher, it’s literally ALL OF THEM. And every time it rains— even just a little— the school suspends classes. At this point, it feels like the only reason we go to school is to hang out with our classmates, because the education part is barely there.

To top it all off, the school even offers college programs, but they only have like two courses. With the way the SHS program is being run, I honestly don’t know how “valid” those college courses could possibly be. It’s hard to believe CHED or DepEd would recognize any of this if they looked closely.

The weirdest part is that no one else complains. The other grade levels think this setup is normal. Our grade level is the only one questioning it, because it’s obvious that something is wrong here. We’re paying tuition, we’re paying for tests, we’re paying for overpriced food and unnecessary events, and in return we’re not getting proper education, proper strand subjects, or even a proper class schedule.

At this point, it feels like the school is cutting corners and pretending to offer all these strands and even college programs when they clearly don’t have the staff, the curriculum, or the resources to make any of it real. I’m seriously worried about whether DepEd might eventually audit this school and shut it down. Highly doubt it since they've been operating since 2016, I think. If that happens, would my Grade 11 credits even count? What if colleges won’t take our SHS diploma seriously because we never actually got the right strand requirements? Especially those who didn't take HUMSS strand. 

So yeah, is this how schools usually run for Seniors? Or is my school just a sketchy, fly-by-night operation that’s basically taking our tuition money without giving us the proper education we’re supposed to be getting?💔

*Sundresses are really pretty, I love them a lot :)*

**Purpose:**

*To help others I guess. I enjoy helping others thrive.*

**Anime:**

*One Punch Man is really funny, it was a fun watch! I might pick up the manga too! :D*

**Study:**

*History I guess? I love learning about the past, I think it is incredibly interesting.*

*I don't really watch any sports tbh, but Hockey sounds like a funny sport. Why do they get put in time out?*

**Book:**

*The Bone Comics are peak, don't @ me.*

**Zodiac:**

*Aries, though I don't feel very attuned to their stereotypes.* 

**Season:**

*Spring! Controversial, I know, but hear me out. I do not have seasonal allergies, which I think is a major factor as to why I enjoy spring and most people do not. However, I also enjoy spring because of other factors, like warmer weather (but not too warm), pretty plants and flowers are blooming, cute little critters are waking up and birdsong fills the air (I managed to get a cute video of 2 bunnies playing, it was adorable!!). It is just a nice time, the earth around me is waking up from the winter slumber, and everything is alive again, it just boosts my mood a lot haha. Not to say I don't like other seasons, but I could go on and on about each one haha so I'll leave it here.*

**Food:**

*Shrimp Alfredo!!! I love sea food. I love pasta. I love cheese. Self explanatory lmao.*

**Game:**

*Dungeons & Dragons!! Nerdy, I know, but I just enjoy it so much. I hope to one day play a campaign irl, as I have only ever played online. I could talk about D&D for forever, I just love how it is a collaborative story-telling experience with a mix of unpredictability in the dice rolls. My favorite class to play is definitely Barbarian haha.*

**Place:**

*The mountains definitely. The Rocky Mountains, if I were to be specific. I just love them overall, the scent of pine, the sounds of nature, the camping and hiking you can do, it's just really nice and pretty.*

**Hobby:**

*I love playing video games on my PC. My favorites being Baldur's Gate 3, Stardew Valley (with mods) and Risk of Rain 2. I am highly looking forward to Silksong too. I will not engage in any PvP or competitive games though, they are always toxic and I don't want anything to do with them.* 

**MBTI:**

*Guess!*

**Song:**

'sex' by EDEN in the album 'i think you think too much of me'

**Cartoon:**

*I suppose Steven Universe? I liked the original series, but didn't really get into the 'Future' series.* 

**Manhwa:**

*I had to look this up. I guess Under the Oak Tree? I read a bit of it and it was cool I guess.* 

**Drink:**

*Iced Coffee! Particularly, the sweet variety!* 

**Color:**

*I love the color yellow. Pastel yellow, golden yellow, it is a lovely color.* 

**Animal:**

*A little basic, but I adore cats. They are just little guys!!*

**Eye Color:**

*Not to be that blue eyed bitch, but I'd describe my eyes as a blue-grey.* 

**Car:**

*2025 Lamborghini Revuelto. I just think it looks neat.* 

**Movie:**

*I love Howl's Moving Castle. I really enjoy the love story and relate to Sophie.* 

**Plant:**

*Wisteria Tree!! I like Willow Trees too, but this one is kinda like a Willow, but with pretty flowers!*

**Career:**

*~~sugar baby~~*

**Hair:**

*Essentially the pic lmao. Longish straight hair, and I know I said blonde, but I am currently growing out my hair after dying it a bunch of times, and it is growing back darker than the blonde I was in high school. Maybe light brown would be more accurate? I'm also thinking of growing out my bangs, but I'm still deciding. I like the way they look, but also they are a bit of extra work to make sure they look good, and they get messed up so easy, and are the first to get oily, and ehhhh idk haha*",3,1756861531.0,MbtiTypeMe,14,1.0,False

\
Alt text: Businesspeople in professional corporate meeting, Bahrain company formation support. reports that 1,100+ new commercial registrations were filed in Q1 2025—a record.\
The business scene spans from the diplomatic towers in Bahrain Bay to the bustling innovation labs in the Seef District. Unlike neighboring GCC hubs, Bahrain's cost of doing business remains 20-30% lower, particularly for fintech and creative sectors (source: Gulf News). The government’s proactive stance on digitalization, plus a uniquely “human-scale” culture, makes company formation in Bahrain both practical and attractive. I’ve seen this firsthand—your new company can grow quickly here, especially with the right support.\
\
Importantly, Tamkeen isn’t just a grants machine. It’s a multi-channel support engine, directly boosting startups, scaling SMEs, and even FDI projects (official info). No other Gulf program feels this locally tuned.\
\
What is Tamkeen? Bahrain’s Business Growth Engine\
The Tamkeen Advantage\
Tamkeen is Bahrain’s semi-government authority tasked with supporting private sector enterprise and workforce development. Whether you’re a micro-entrepreneur in the Diplomatic Area or a fintech launching in Bahrain Bay, Tamkeen probably has a program for you.\
Current (2025) Tamkeen Offerings Include:\
\
Direct financial grants (capital expenditure, salary support)\
Training and upskilling incentives (digital, technical, leadership)\
Startup & SME financing (with partner banks, often at subsidized rates)\
Export promotion and market access programs\
Tech adoption and digitalization grants\
Employment support for Bahrainis\
Sector-specific support for fintech, hospitality, healthcare, logistics, and creative industries\
\
Tamkeen’s programs adjust regularly—they launched Enterprise Support Edition 5.0 in March 2025, increasing the maximum SME grant to BHD 40,000 (previously BHD 30,000).\
\
And here’s an insider’s tip: Tamkeen will often fast-track digital industry grants if you apply in the window right after Ramadan, when business hours return to normal and review queues are shortest.\
\
The Bahrain Business Environment in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business district in Manama, Bahrain, modern middle east business environment. simplifies company formation and digitalizes renewals via the Sijilat portal\
Bahrain’s Key Business Hubs\
\
Bahrain Financial Harbour (regulatory corridor)\
Seef District (tech startups and consultancies)\
Diplomatic Area (banking, legal, and government ministries)\
Bahrain Bay (fintech, creative sector, upscale F&B)\
\
\
What sets Bahrain apart from, say, Dubai or Riyadh? Flexibility. Startups can secure 100% foreign ownership with far less red tape, and the infamous “wasta” (connections) system is less of a bottleneck—though relationships still help!\
\
Quick tangent: At my first majlis-style pitch meeting in Seef, coffee was served before any negotiation, and we started with family news before talking business. Never skip the qahwa.\
Types of Support Tamkeen Offers to Bahrain Businesses\
1. Capital & Operational Grants\
Tamkeen’s flagship Enterprise Support grants cover:\
- Equipment & Capital Purchases (BHD 5,000 to BHD 40,000)\
- Business Development (marketing, branding, trade shows)\
- IT & Digitalization (ERP, e-commerce, cybersecurity)\
Example: A client based in Bahrain Bay secured BHD 18,000 for cloud infrastructure, covering 60% of their IT upgrade costs.\
2. Salary & Training Subsidies\
\
Salary Support: Up to 70% of Bahraini employee salaries for 2 years (as of April 2025)\
Graduate Training: 6-12 month programs with up to BHD 300/month per trainee\
\
Personally, I used Tamkeen’s salary support for my first Bahraini hire. They handled reimbursement directly—no red tape, payment within a month.\
3. Startup & SME Loans\
\
Tamweel Financing: Partner loans with rates as low as 2.5%, BHD 5,000-BHD 500,000\
Ideal for scaling after establishing traction; Tamkeen absorbs part of the risk.\
\
4. Export, Tech, and Sector Initiatives\
\
Export Bahrain: Market entry grants and matchmaking for GCC, MENA, and global exports\
Sector Accelerators: Tailored schemes in fintech, hospitality, healthcare, creative media\
Digital Transformation: Co-funding for ERP, CRM, and cybersecurity\
\
\
Step-By-Step: Tapping Tamkeen Support for Your Business\
1. Prepare Your Application\
\
Register your business on Sijilat (see full process here)\
Gather audited (or management) financials, CR extract, passport copies, detailed proposal\
For capital grants, prepare 3 supplier quotations (this step trips up many founders—insider tip: Use suppliers with a Tamkeen track record; ask at the Diplomatic Area Tamkeen branch for a list)\
\
2. Choose the Right Program\
\
Review active programs at Tamkeen Portal\
For startups, the “Startup Bahrain” scheme is usually fastest (2-4 weeks)\
\
3. Submit & Track Application\
\
Online submission via Tamkeen’s e-Services portal (avoid peak times: traffic spikes after 10am on Sundays)\
Save time by scanning all documents beforehand—Tamkeen accepts e-signatures as of February 2025\
\
4. Interview & Evaluation\
\
If requested, attend a short interview (majlis style—prepare a 3-minute elevator pitch, and don’t be surprised if they offer Arabic coffee)\
Evaluation is pragmatic; focus on your direct business impact and hiring plans\
\
5. Approval and Disbursement\
\
Grant letters arrive via email; funds released typically within 4-6 weeks\
For capital grants, payments go directly to suppliers (sometimes you’ll need to follow up; keep WhatsApp contacts of your Tamkeen officer handy)\
\
\
Cost Considerations: How Much Should You Budget?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, calculator money, Bahrain company formation budget.**   |\
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|\
| Commercial Registration     | 50 - 250                 |\
| Professional License (annual) | 100 - 300              |\
| Office Lease (Seef, min. size) | 350 - 700/month        |\
| Sponsorship/Local Agent     | 0 (if 100% foreign allowed) to 1,500/year |\
| MOICT & LMRA Fees           | 150 - 500 (per activity/employee) |\
| Legal/Consultancy           | 300 - 2,000 (dependent on scope) |\
\
Visit KeylinkBH’s cost breakdown for detailed, up-to-date figures and budgeting tools.\
\
Cost-Saving Tip:\
Apply for Tamkeen support before finalizing your office lease—many grants are capped or limited if you sign a contract first. (Learned this the hard way—my first grant was reduced because I inked the lease before approval.)\
Free Zones:\
Businesses in Bahrain’s free zones enjoy reduced customs, 100% foreign ownership, and streamlined Tamkeen grant processing. Explore Bahrain’s free zones for sector eligibility.\
\
Choosing Your Bahrain Business Structure\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, team meeting.            | Up to 100% link | Low liability, Tamkeen eligible | Min. 2 shareholders      |\
| SPC (Single Person)  | 100% link | Solo founder, fast setup         | Not all activities allowed |\
| Branch Office        | 100% (if FDI)        | Parent company status             | Limited activities       |\
| S.P.C.               | 100%                 | Easiest for freelancers           | Some licensing limits    |\
Check KeylinkBH’s business structure guide for sector fit and licensing nuances.\
Challenge: First time I registered a WLL, I tried to open a shared desk in Bahrain Bay. Turns out, Tamkeen requires a physical address—no virtual offices! Solved it by partnering with a coworking space that’s pre-approved (ask at Tamkeen’s Bahrain Bay office for their up-to-date list).\
\
Navigating Compliance: What You Need to Know\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, regulatory requirements.\
- Annual renewal via Sijilat portal (see process)\
- Accounting and Bookkeeping: Mandatory for most business types. Professional services can help.\
- VAT Returns: Quarterly reporting for most SMEs; exempt if under BHD 37,500 annual turnover\
- Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA): Visa processing, Bahrainization quotas\
Regulatory update: As of June 2025, the MOICT introduced a new digital signature standard for company filings—speeding up document verification but requiring all directors to obtain eID cards.\
\
Pro tip: Use Sijilat’s “fast-track” window at the Diplomatic Area government complex (open from 7:30am—queues are lightest until 9am).\
\
A common mistake: Many founders forget to update their Commercial Registration if they add new activities—leads to hefty fines. Set a recurring reminder, and budget BHD 20-35 for each activity update.\
\
How Tamkeen Support Stacks Up: Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi Arabia\
Surprisingly, Bahrain’s Tamkeen support feels more personal and flexible than the UAE’s highly structured programs or Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 grants.\
\
Faster disbursal: Most Tamkeen grants reach your business within 1-2 months, versus 4-6 months for comparable UAE support.\
Lighter documentation: Bahrain requires fewer supporting docs, especially for SMEs.\
Local relationships: Majlis-style Tamkeen interviews foster genuine networking—proposals are often discussed over Arabic coffee with decision-makers.\
\
\
One standout: Tamkeen’s sector-specific grants (e.g. creative, fintech) are not only cash-based but also provide mentorship, industry connections, and export advice. That’s often overlooked by expats used to rigid GCC government programs.\
\
\
Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\
\
\
Applying for the wrong Tamkeen program\
Cross-check your business activity with the current eligibility criteria—rules shift every 6-12 months.\
\
\
Incomplete documentation\
Have your CR, financials, and supplier quotes ready. Digital copies only since March 2025—no originals needed.\
\
\
Underestimating processing time around Ramadan\
Bahraini offices operate reduced hours and staggered shifts—apply before or after Ramadan for faster results.\
\
\
Overlooking ongoing compliance\
Automate your Sijilat filing and VAT reminders. Use Keylink BH’s outsourcing services—reliable and efficient.\
\
\
\

Images of Support in Action\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, Tamkeen consultation in Bahrain. and check eligibility before applying.\
Q2: How long does Tamkeen approval take?\
\
Standard processing is 2-6 weeks for most grants. Startup schemes move fastest—often 2-3 weeks. Apply outside Ramadan and public holidays for optimal speed.\
\
Q3: What are the hidden costs of company formation in Bahrain?\
\
Apart from license and office costs (see breakdown), budget for annual renewals (BHD 100-300), LMRA fees, and compliance outsourcing (BHD 250+ annually for bookkeeping). Prepare a BHD 3,000 starting fund for micro-SME setups.\
\
Q4: Is local sponsorship necessary for all companies?\
\
No—most activities allow 100% foreign ownership. But for certain sectors, local sponsorship may still be required. Always confirm with MOICT and Tamkeen before applying.\
\
Q5: What sectors get the most Tamkeen support?\
\
Priority sectors include fintech, creative, hospitality, health, logistics, and IT. Custom support is available for manufacturing/export via Export Bahrain.\
\

Coming from the USA, most coffee shops open quite early (usually 6 AM but even as early as 5 in some cases). During my visit to Brazil so far, however, I've noticed that the coffee shops here don't open until 8, 9, or even 10. I thought this was reallt interesting as I imagined many people may want to make a stop before going to work (or going out to explore, in my case).

Brazilians, I'm curious! Do most coffee shops stick to business hours rather than opening at the crack of dawn, or is this something distinctive to Salvador?

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

# Ingredients Needed

Fresh coffee makes the shake taste better. Use instant coffee for speed. Brewed coffee gives more flavor. Pick what you like best. Strong coffee adds a bold taste. Mild coffee makes it smoother.

Choose a protein powder you enjoy. Whey protein mixes well and is popular. Plant-based protein is good for vegans. Make sure it’s a flavor you like. Vanilla or chocolate work well. They mix nicely with coffee.

Adding extras can make your shake special. Bananas add sweetness and creaminess. Peanut butter gives a nutty flavor. Ice cubes make it cold and refreshing. Feel free to add a spoon of honey. It makes it sweeter.

# Step-by-step Preparation

Start by brewing a fresh cup of coffee. Use your favorite method. It could be a coffee maker or a French press. Ensure the coffee is strong. Let it cool to room temperature. This avoids melting the ice later. Measure about half a cup. This will be enough for the shake.

Take a scoop of your favorite protein powder. It should be around 20 grams. Put it in a blender. Add the brewed coffee to it. Stir well to mix them evenly. This makes sure there are no clumps.

Add a cup of ice to the blender. Pour in half a cup of milk. You can use any milk you like. Blend on high speed. Make sure everything is smooth. Pour into a glass. Enjoy your coffee protein shake.

The only choice for complete dual acid base pH balance.

I’ve tried just about every alkaline water, mineral drop, and fancy “structured” liquid on the market—and none of them come close to what I’ve experienced with **Alklyte™**.

Here’s why:

# ⚗️ The Problem with Most Alkaline Waters

Bottled alkaline waters are usually:

* **Overpriced** ($3–$5 per bottle)
* **Poorly buffered** – they may have high pH in the bottle, but little resistance to stomach acid
* **Flat** – no reaction, no transformation, just static mineral water
* Often stored in plastic bottles, which kind of defeats the “health” narrative

# 💥 Enter: Alklyte™

**Alklyte™** is the only pH support drink that uses a **carbonated effervescent reaction** to **activate a dual-buffer system** the moment it hits water.

That means:  
✅ Real-time pH shift  
✅ Gentle fizz (the only natural soda)  
✅ **Bicarbonate** buffers  
✅ Combined with **citrate**, which converts in the body to more bicarbonate  
✅ Portable, plastic-reducing container – no wasteful bottled water

# 🔬 What Makes the Dual-Buffer System Better?

* **Bicarbonates** react immediately to neutralize excess dietary acid
* **Citrate** is metabolized by your body into bicarbonate (like a second wave of buffering under your body's natural control)
* The **reaction itself** improves taste, smooths the texture of acidic drinks, and enhances sweetness perception (crazy but true!)

No bottled water does that. No drops and No chalky tablets do either. 

**Personal Take**

I drink Alklyte every morning with coffee (kills the acidity!), with every meal, and again after working out. I’ve ditched all store-bought alkaline waters - they are completely ineffective. Alklyte costs a fraction of what other inferior products and so called alkaline waters cost.

If you’ve ever wanted to feel the **difference between “alkaline in a lab” and “alkaline where it matters”**, give it a try. Just don’t be surprised when you get real results you can feel.

Let’s start using smart science.
