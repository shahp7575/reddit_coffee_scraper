1inugfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1inugfz/sudden_intense_feeling_of_fullness/,sudden intense feeling of fullness,"hello! this is my third week on semaglutide (8 units). the first 2 weeks were okay, no major side effects and I’ve felt hunger but definitely more controlled. also less cravings and impulsive eating urges. I’ve lost about 2.5lbs which I know isn’t a lot but I’m okay with slow and steady progress.

anyways… this week I’ve been having this intense feeling or fullness maybe like an hour after a meal, even if the meal was small. or even if I drank a large coffee. I feel normal fullness after eating and then ~1 hour later I feel uncomfortably bloated and full for a while… and then it goes away.

has anyone else experienced this? do you have any advice? :)",1,1739376618.0,Semaglutide,1,1.0,False

Everything was fine until one day she ghosted me for like 15 days, and the reason she gave me was that a function was going on in her house, since she belongs to an orthodox family she avoided talking to me, but the real reason behind this was that, a day before she ghosted me I spoke to her something very emotional as she was leaving India, but from then on things started going downhill, I spoke to her rudely because she ghosted me, But again I called her 5-6 times and I wished her ATB and removed her from all Socials, since i was giving exams and it was overwhelming me emotionally.

But now after 1.5-2 years(because I had deactivated all my accounts), she texts me again stating that I have ruined many relationships and one of his friends who is an astrologer told her this thing, so she willingly texted everyone in her contact list with whom she has lost touch with(this is what she told me).  But she indirectly asked me if I was dating someone or not.

But now my question she is not in India, on top of that she is asking me indirectly if I am dating someone or not.

**Summary:** I asked a girl out during college, spoke to her for 3 months fought with her since she ghosted me, and said ATB to her since she was leaving India, but now after 2 years she texts me back again asking me if I was dating or not indirectly.",1,1739376465.0,RelationshipIndia,2,1.0,False
1inudtk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1inudtk,Restock and quick Oatly pod review,"Got my order in yesterday late afternoon, yes I was tempted to have a cup at 8pm but I fought the urge. 🤣 
I know, I know, “Only 5 sleeves theme rookie numbers son!” In my defense I still had probably 2-3 sleeves left from my last order. Plus I refill as well (check my last couple posts), just got done filling a bunch of pods and have to order another bag of beans soon. Never a shortage of coffee in this house that’s for sure. 

Short Oatly first impressions review:

I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of this pod as a latte. Sadly I did not try it plain at all before mixing my morning iced deliciousness. From what I could tell/taste though the pod complimented the creamer sooo well and I can tell that it would taste best with Oatmilk as directed by Oatly soo adamantly on the sleeve packaging. This was also my first time trying the Planet Oat Brown Sugar Cookie Oatmilk Creamer and it is phenomenal. Has all the taste profile of a brown butter/ brown sugar, sugar cookie with that lovely baked goods flavor that oat milk also adds. I would probably do less cream next time or made it a Quad shot and brewed two of them as it was a bit sweeter than I would normally drink it. I will definitely be keeping both the Oatly as long as it’s available and the Planet Oat Brown Sugar Cookie in my regular rotation. 

I prepared mine as an Iced brown sugar Oatmilk shaken espresso. 😋

- Ice filled glass 4-5 cubes
- 1 small pump of Monin Spiced Brown Sugar Syrup
- Frothed 1/4-1/2 cup Planet Oat Brown Sugar Cookie Creamer (👍x3)
- 1 Vertuo Oatly pod
- Small pinch (dust) dark brown sugar on top

Prepare “Oatly” pod over ice, syrup, 1/2 frothed creamer. 
Cover and shake lightly.
Froth and add remaining creamer. 
Top with small pinch of Dark Brown Sugar and swirl lightly. 
Drink and Enjoy 😊 

May update this post later after a few more pods!

Have a great day everybody and enjoy your beans!

A man badly injured in the 1998 Omagh bomb has recalled rescuing his infant niece from the rubble of the explosion and then learning she had not survived.

Garry McGillion was on a shopping trip to buy 20-month-old Breda Devine shoes for his upcoming wedding.

He told the public inquiry how he handed Breda over to a policeman: ""I felt her heartbeat on my chest. To this day, I still feel it.""

He said when he found out she had died it was ""something that ripped my heart out"".

Mr McGillion was 24 at the time of the 1998 attack, which left him badly burned and with shrapnel injuries.

His wedding was due to take place a week later and he was in Omagh with his fiancée, his sister and Breda, who was his goddaughter.

He said the blast was like ""an electric shock"" to his body.

""I could hear children shouting for their mums, mums shouting for their children, people shouting for loved ones, the piercing screams of people.

""The scenes I witnessed were horrendous. Those images will be forever ingrained in my brain.

""They have haunted me every day for the past 26 years.""

Mr McGillion and Donna-Marie McGillion were married a year later and now have two children.

He told the inquiry: ""I know it wasn't my fault, but I was there to protect her (Breda).

""It's a guilt I will always carry.

""The scars are there forever, the hurt, the pain, the grief is there forever.

""We lost a beautiful girl that day.

""We can't bring her back but she lives on with us day and night.""

At the conclusion of his evidence, inquiry chairman Lord Turnbull praised Mr McGillion's bravery in trying to save Breda.

Given last rites four times
Donna-Marie McGillion was 22 at the time of the attack.

She told the inquiry she was ""forever grateful"" to her husband for rescuing her and to the doctors who saved her life.

Mrs McGillion was given a 20% chance of survival, after suffering burns to almost two thirds of her body.

She was given the last rites on four occasions and shrapnel remains embedded in her neck and back.

""I am forever grateful, first of all to Garry, but also for anybody who did help me on the street that day, who got me to hospital, who worked with me in hospital, right through to all of my doctors and my surgeons,"" she said.

She told the inquiry she hoped it would obtain answers.

""We're never going to move on, it's always going to be there, but we need to have closure,"" she said.

Lord Turnbull said her evidence would help people understand the gravity of the attack

Survivor Jaime McGlinn said the force of the explosion blew him out of his shoes.

He was 19 and along with his girlfriend, had been evacuated from a coffee shop.

In video evidence played to the inquiry, he recalled the attack, which left him with a fractured skull and other injuries.

""The impact was unbelievable,"" he said.

""I remember landing on the ground. I remember the glass. I remember the smell.

""It was like burning matches.

""I remember coming round and being in the midst of devastation.""

Mr McGlinn described himself as one of ""the lucky ones"".

He added: ""I believe the inquiry is very important to close the chapter in a positive way for all of those involved that day.""

What was the Omagh bomb?
The bomb that devastated Omagh town centre in August 1998 was the biggest single atrocity in the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

Twenty-nine people were killed, including nine children, a woman pregnant with twins, and three generations of one family.

It came less than three months after the people of Northern Ireland had voted yes to the Good Friday Agreement.

Who carried out the Omagh bombing?
Three days after the attack, the Real IRA released a statement claiming responsibility for the explosion.

It apologised to ""civilian"" victims and said its targets had been commercial.

Almost 27 years on, no-one has been convicted of carrying out the murders by a criminal court.

In 2009, a judge ruled that four men - Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were all liable for the Omagh bomb.

The four men were ordered to pay a total of £1.6m in damages to the relatives, but appeals against the ruling delayed the compensation process.

A fifth man, Seamus McKenna, was acquitted in the civil action and later died in a roofing accident in 2013.

The public inquiry
After years of campaigning by relatives, the public inquiry was set to up examine if the Real IRA attack could have been prevented by UK authorities.

This phase of the inquiry is continuing to hear powerful individual testimonies from relatives who lost loved ones in the explosion.

The bombers planned and launched the attack from the Republic of Ireland and the Irish government has promised to co-operate with the inquiry.

However, the victims' relatives wanted the Irish government to order its own separate public inquiry.

Dublin previously indicated there was no new evidence to merit such a move.",0,1739376033.0,northernireland,1,0.5,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1inu5w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TastefulCoffee/comments/1inu5w7/shardor_cg638b2_coffee_grinder_review_compact/,SHARDOR CG638B-2 Coffee Grinder Review: Compact Design with Versatile Features,"I’ve been using the SHARDOR CG638B-2 Coffee Grinder for several months now, and it has become an essential part of my daily coffee routine. This electric coffee grinder stands out for its modern design, which fits perfectly on my crowded kitchen counter. With its sleek black finish and stainless steel construction, it not only looks great but also feels durable enough to handle consistent use.

The grinder comes with two removable stainless steel bowls: one with two blades for dry ingredients and another with four blades for wet grinding. I’ve experimented with both, grinding everything from coffee beans and spices to wet ingredients like garlic and ginger. The removable bowls make cleaning a breeze, which is a big plus for someone like me who uses it daily.

[Check SHARDOR CG638B-2 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/shardor-cg638b-2-coffee-grinder-review-b0csygk5bv/)

What’s particularly impressive is the adjustable grinding precision. You can set the grinding time from 1 to 30 seconds, which allows you to achieve anything from coarse grounds for a French press to fine powder for espresso. I found this feature especially handy when preparing coffee for different brewing methods. However, I noticed that the grind consistency isn’t always perfect, especially for finer settings, which is a limitation of blade grinders in general.

**Design & Build Quality** The SHARDOR CG638B-2 is compact and lightweight, weighing just 2.6 pounds. Its small footprint allows it to fit neatly into my limited counter space. The materials feel premium, with a mix of stainless steel and plastic that contributes to its durability. The removable bowls are well-designed with rounded edges, which makes handling them comfortable even for someone with sensitive joints or arthritis. However, getting the bowls to lock into place can sometimes feel tricky, which could be challenging for users with limited dexterity.

**Grinding Performance** The grinding performance is solid for a blade grinder. It handles coffee beans, spices, and even wet ingredients efficiently. I particularly enjoyed how quickly it ground coffee beans for my morning brew; it took under 30 seconds to achieve a medium grind for my drip coffee maker. While it’s not as precise as a burr grinder, the SHARDOR does a commendable job for its price point.

**Grinding Mechanism** This is a blade grinder, which is less precise than burr grinders but offers versatility. The blades are sharp and effective, especially for coarse and medium grinds. The machine also operates at a relatively low noise level—63 decibels on average—which means I can prepare my coffee early in the morning without waking the entire household. That’s a feature I didn’t know I needed until I experienced it.

**Ease of Use** One-button operation makes this grinder user-friendly. The timer knob is clearly marked, which simplifies the process of adjusting grind time. However, I noticed that the grind size consistency depends heavily on the amount of beans you put in. If you’re someone who needs precise grinds for specialty coffee brewing methods, this might not be the ideal choice.

**Capacity & Speed** The grinder holds enough beans to make coffee for several cups, which is perfect for my daily needs. It’s also fast; grinding enough coffee for a pot takes less than a minute. This speed is a lifesaver during busy mornings when every second counts.

**Pros**

* Compact and modern design fits small spaces.
* Dual bowls for wet and dry grinding add versatility.
* Operates quietly at 63 dB, making it less disruptive.
* Adjustable grind timer for different brewing methods.
* Easy to clean, with removable and dishwasher-safe bowls.

**Cons**

* Grind consistency is not as precise as burr grinders.
* Locking the bowl into place can be finicky.
* Longevity might be a concern; some users reported issues after a year.
* The timer-based grind precision can be inconsistent if the bowl isn’t filled to the same level each time.

**Comparison to Competitors** Compared to burr grinders like the Baratza Encore, the SHARDOR CG638B-2 lacks precision but makes up for it with versatility and a lower price point. While the Encore excels in consistent grind size and is better for coffee enthusiasts, it doesn’t offer the ability to grind wet ingredients, which makes the SHARDOR more versatile. On the other hand, it outperforms cheaper models like the Hamilton Beach blade grinder in noise level and build quality, making it a mid-tier option worth considering.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money** The SHARDOR CG638B-2 offers excellent value for its price. While it doesn’t deliver the grind precision of high-end burr grinders, its ability to grind both wet and dry ingredients adds versatility that many competitors lack. For someone who needs an all-in-one solution for coffee, spices, and occasional wet grinding, this grinder is a solid investment.

Overall, the SHARDOR CG638B-2 Coffee Grinder is a fantastic option for casual coffee drinkers and those who want a multi-purpose grinder. Its modern design, quiet operation, and versatility make it a worthwhile addition to any kitchen, despite some minor flaws.

1inu58u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1inu58u,Advice Needed - First time to dentist in years,"
I, Female (29) went to the dentist for the first time in years. 

I do not smoke or drink. Coffee drinker but nothing crazy. I don’t usually floss. Use an oral b electric toothbrush. 

Note that I have a bridge (Maryland I think?) currently that was put in when I was like 16. 

History: 
I have a history of blood clots in my teenage years due to multiple factors. I do not have Factor V Leiden and do have MTHFR homozygous which shouldn’t affect blood clotting. My dentist is making me go to a hematologist to get clearance for a deep cleaning. Is that normal? 

Also, she did X-rays and said I “might” need a root canal, but isn’t sure. Im having zero pain or symptoms for that. So I have to go to an endo and pay $250 for a consult and special xray. So basically if they tell me I don’t even need one that’s throwing $250 away? obviously dental insurance sucks and I only get $1500 allowance so the deep cleaning will use most of that. ATTACHED X-RAYS - Do you see any teeth that need root canal? She is saying it’s tooth #3 she is unsure of… 

My dentist also referred me to an endo that isn’t even in network with me, makes me feel weird that it’s more of their “partnership” why they referred me there. 

Thoughts and suggestions are much appreciated.

1inu4zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1inu4zd/best_french_press_coffee_maker_mueller/,Best French press coffee maker? Mueller MU-SSHYDPRESS review reveals it all!,"I’ve been using the Mueller MU-SSHYDPRESS French Press Coffee Maker for a while now, and let me tell you, my mornings have never been the same. Coffee lovers like me often chase that elusive perfect cup, and this stainless steel French press might just be the answer. The sleek metallic finish and double-wall insulation caught my eye right out of the box, but it was the coffee-making experience that truly hooked me.

This french press is perfect for anyone who enjoys versatility and durability. Whether you’re making a strong morning coffee, brewing tea, frothing milk, or even creating hot chocolate, it handles it all effortlessly. I even tested it for camping trips—it’s sturdy, rust-free, and the cool-touch handle is a blessing when you're dealing with boiling water on the go.

Its operation is delightfully straightforward. Add coarse coffee grounds, pour hot water, stir, let it brew for four minutes, and press the plunger. Voila! A rich, full-bodied cup of coffee awaits. The four-level filtration system is a game-changer, eliminating grounds better than other French presses I’ve tried before. No gritty surprises in my last sip!

While the Mueller MU-SSHYDPRESS excels in many areas, it's not without its quirks. For instance, its 34oz capacity works well for two large mugs, but if you’re brewing for a crowd, you might need a second batch.

[Want to see Mueller MU-SSHYDPRESS offers? Amazon’s got you.](https://applianceheaven.com/product-reviews/best-french-press-mueller-mu-sshydpress-review-b07jgbk6xv/)

The double-wall stainless steel construction keeps beverages hot for an impressive amount of time—perfect for those lazy weekend mornings. I also loved how easy it was to clean. A quick rinse usually does the job, but it’s dishwasher safe if you’re feeling extra lazy. However, disassembling and cleaning the filter components can be a minor hassle if you’re rushing.

**Pros**

* Maintains coffee temperature for over an hour thanks to its insulated design.
* Durable stainless steel construction suitable for travel, camping, or home use.
* Four-level filtration ensures grit-free coffee every time.
* Multi-purpose: works for tea, milk frothing, and more.
* Dishwasher-safe and relatively easy to clean.

**Cons**

* Slightly cumbersome to clean if you disassemble filters every time.
* 34oz capacity might not suit larger gatherings.
* Some customers reported discrepancies in size and branding, so double-check your order.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to standard glass French presses, the Mueller MU-SSHYDPRESS wins in durability. Glass ones shatter easily and aren’t travel-friendly, whereas this one feels built to last. The double-wall insulation here is also leagues ahead of thin-walled competitors like Bodum Chambord—your coffee stays hot longer. On the flip side, Bodum’s lightweight design might appeal to minimalists or those who prefer glass aesthetics. However, the Mueller’s four-level filtration stands out, as it prevents grounds far better than most alternatives.

Competitors like the Frieling French Press match Mueller in terms of build quality but come at a much higher price point. If you’re on a budget, this press offers excellent value without compromising on performance.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
Considering its sturdy build, multi-functional use, and excellent filtration, the Mueller MU-SSHYDPRESS is a solid investment. While it’s not the cheapest French press out there, its quality justifies the price. You could spend significantly more on high-end presses without seeing a proportional improvement in results. That said, if you don’t need the double-wall insulation or are brewing for just one, you might find a cheaper option that suffices.

Overall, the Mueller MU-SSHYDPRESS blends aesthetics, functionality, and durability. Whether I’m whipping up a quick weekday brew or indulging in a slow Sunday morning ritual, it delivers every time.

- 46 
- 220lbs 
- relatively active and fit

I take 2.5mg of Cialis daily which seems to help ease symptoms.  I cannot take things like Tamsulosin because it causes me to become so stuffy I have panick attacks.  The best thing I have done for myself is to stop drinking coffee and focus on quality sleep 

I recently listened to an episode of the Mind Pump Podcast.  They had a guest by the name of Jay Campbell who was talking quite a bit about peptides and bioregulators.  Most of the episode was focused on the newest peptide in the GPL-1 arena.  About 49mins into the episode he mentions a peptide specific to prostate health called Libidon A-16.  It's considered a bioregulator, however most of the research on them was done in Russia years ago so there is very little info (in English at least) about them.  Even less about a-16.   

Figuring I had spent enough on medical bills, dropping $130 on 60 pills of this stuff was worth a shot.  I just started it yesterday.  No immediate side effects aside from *maybe* diahrrea and gas?  I literally started this at 3pm yesterday so that could've been caused from something else.  Just curious if anyone else has heard of this or tried it?

It came out of NOWHERE. I’ve tried everything under the sun. Spiro, Tret, minimal step skin care, multi step skin care. EVERYTHING. The spiro did help some but it’s still there. It started at 31 and I’m 33 now. I had never drank celcius/pre workout drinks until, surprise, 2 years ago. Exactly when this started. I started working out in march 2023 and was at the dermatologist in tears by may 2023. 

I have an unhealthy addiction to celcius and preworkout drinks. I realized the other day that this is the only thing I have not tried removing from my diet (I’ve tried low dairy, high protein, low gluten, everything). My acne got significantly worse when I was working night shift (consuming up to 6 celcius per shift to stay awake). I go and do some research and lo and behold, excess B12 and biotin are both linked to cystic acne. I have been consuming probably lethal (jk. Maybe) levels of B12 and biotin since I started working out in march 2023. 

Today is day 1 with no celcius. My dog and I have a normal routine of going to the gas station together to stock up on my normal amount of celcius. 2 to 4 per day. I’m sad. My dogs sad. We’re all sad over here about the breakup with my beloved energy drink. I’ve switched to black coffee and oatmilk creamer. The true mark of middle age *le sigh* 

My main question here is how long should I expect this to theoretically take? If celcius is the cause of my cystic acne, will it clear up within a week or two of no celcius? Should I expect it to take longer?

I would like to visit a cafe/coffee shop in Madrid that uses an Ascaso Machine (Made in Spain). I would like to see an Ascaso machine and also; since I am in Spain, why would I drink a Spanish espresso made by an Italian La Marzocco. HAHA

I have looked, but there's none, I think. Believe me, I ""looked look"". I'm also giving you this list, purely based off of Google Maps recent reviews/images. Will hit Dosis for the Slayer.

Please also suggest places for Cafe Bombon-a latte with condensed milk. The wife loves sweet drinks. So places with pistachio latte, caramel, vanilla would also be nice. Naji, El Patio Vertical, Bocono, Rebel and Logic are the ones I have seen with sweet drinks thus far.

This is not a complete Madrid list, just the ones I saw near Puerta del Sol and/or included in europeancoffeetrip's list.

Stayed 6 nights in Reykjavík. Opted not to rent a car. Given the treacherous roads when we got in, and the bad roads day we booked a trip to South Iceland, I feel we made a good call. In nicer months I would totally book a rental car. 
While the weather was bad, it wasn’t nearly as cold as this subreddit led me to think, I packed heavy sweaters that I didn’t need. So don’t listen to random strangers on the internet that it feels colder than the same temperature/wind chill at home. (Says the random person on the internet). 

I highly recommend the Lava Show, especially getting the premium package. For an extra 3400 ISK it includes a private lounge, a beverage (alcoholic or not. Picture of the menu if you were to buy a drink), upstairs seating with best views, and a backstage look at the furnace and details. 

Other highest recommendations are the Reykjavík Cat Walk tour, Hovdenak Distillery tour, and black sand beach. 

High recommendations are the waterfalls and glaciers in South Iceland, 
and northern lights tour (it’s very hit and miss, mostly miss, so set your expectations properly). 

Nice recommendation is Sky Lagoon. I think it’s better than Blue Lagoon. Next time I will try the public geothermal heated pools.

The aroma of freshly ground coffee beans filled the air, weaving a comforting spell over anyone who stepped inside. 

Isla, the café's owner, loved this nook she had crafted with care. The pastel pink coffee machine was her prized possession, standing proudly on the counter, ready to brew warmth into every cup. Next to it, a cake adorned with strawberries awaited those with a sweet tooth, a timeless temptation difficult to resist.

The interior, with its wooden walls and shelves lined with vibrant mugs, mirrored the warmth of a home. Two little stools sat beside a small round table, offering a perfect setting for whispered secrets and shared laughter. Plants thrived in every corner, breathing life into the space, while a wooden sign outside welcomed everyone with a simple ""welcome"" nestled around promises of coffee, latte, and cake.

Every morning, the café drew in a myriad of souls—artists, writers, dreamers—all finding solace in the simplicity of Isla's creations. Despite the chaos outside, inside ""The Cozy Bean,"" time seemed to stretch and slow, encouraging smiles and connections over steaming mugs and delicious slices of cake.

One rainy afternoon, a young poet named Rowan found shelter in the café. A hot latte in hand, he settled by the window, the warm glow spilling some much-needed color into his world. As rain drummed softly against the glass, inspiration struck, and words flowed effortlessly.

Isla watched from behind the counter, a soft smile on her lips. Her little café had once again become a haven, weaving dreams and stories into the tapestry of its walls, just as she had always hoped.",1,1739374384.0,cocowyo,0,1.0,False

So me (M30) was talking to this girl (F30) for a bit, we were connected by a mutual friend. We were only communicating over IG DM's. At first it was going well, then I brought up we should do this activity that we both have a mutual interest in. 

Her ""that sounds great but i dont think it will work out""

Me - as this is within the first 30 min of texting replied with "" why do you think that?""

Her ""just a feeling I get""

Now me being good at reading signs, I took the night to think it over, then the following day responded very politely as 'totally get it, wishing you the best and take care"" - now talking to one of my homies about this scenario he took is ' yah dude some chicks have been let down to much and they don't have high hopes that dudes will follow through ' didn't realize that perspective until AFTER i sent that response. 

Her coming back with question if that was the reason why I reached out to her in the first place to ask her to do this activity together? 

Me responding with the reason I'm reaching out is to grab coffee because i think you're cool etc'

Her coming back with a positive response and wanting to grab coffee (ok green flag)

  
So over that time we were trying to nail down a time to meet, things kept coming up, and comms were distant, now I can understand chicks might not check their DMS or are just not IG alot or just hate technology (which she has confirmed with me)

So over a few weeks it wasn't really going anywhere and i replied back with ' hey if this isn't something that you want to proceed or if now is bad timing, i'd understand just want to respect your space and where you're at right now ' - now there was about a few weeks of no response to this message- so took it as ok cool moving on. - she came back with replying with her number and told her to text her since shes not on IG alot ( ok green flag #2?)

Texting was pretty consistent, but distant overall - day or two for her to reply back. Now reading more into 'relationship attachment styles' I can tell she's an avoidant, and I am more of an anxious/ becoming more secure- now just knowing this helps me out understand how she communicates and why I react (being anxious or worrying why she's not responding xyz). So with her being an avoidant, I know to keep my distance, give her space and time for her to respond, which she does. 

There was a stint were it was  a few texts on my end not being replied to (days apart from each other) ' how are things / day going etc' she came back a day or two later saying she's really swamped and busy and apologies for the delay but she still wants to grab coffee (green flag #3?) 

Awesome cool great- planning a time to meet up, lock in a time and place. Day before I confirm the date, she comes back with being sick - understandable- re schedule - confirmed - day before confirming - she comes back with - shes really busy with work and her schedule is just packed - me - understanding that timing is bad and if she wants to grab coffee when her calendar clears up if that's an option.

her- positive response and wants to meet up down the road (green flag #4?)

  
In my mind I'm giving her multiple opportunities to say no or walk out the door- but she still says yes and wants to meet up (green flag no?)

  
so respecting her distance, I would only text her every few days and for a while texting was pretty consistent and talking about a range of things, deep conversations etc. Then it just suddenly hit a wall- been MIA for 2 weeks now, shot her a text or two just 'hey hope your day is going well' 

Called last week and just left a message checking in. No response. So ball is in her court.

Now in my mind, with me being more secure- waiting for her reply giving her space to reply not being anxious texting every day with no response- feel like this is a slow burn/ building more trust and repour. Coming from a position of strength as I'm waiting for her to respond on her time and not being anxious that she isn't replying. But this delay is worrisome, since we had a great streak of texting then it just died off. 

Am i overthinking this too much?

We’ve been through a lot together, and I always considered him one of my closest friends. He’s the kind of person who usually makes time for the people in his life, checks in when something is wrong, and genuinely seems to care.

But over the past few months, I’ve noticed a huge shift. There’s a distance between us that I can’t quite explain. When I asked him about it, he just said he’s been in his own space. I tried to take that at face value, but I couldn’t help but notice that he’s still spending plenty of time with other people—including a mutual friend of ours. It’s not that he’s isolating himself, it’s just... me.

He doesn’t check in on me like he used to, even when I went through a tough time recently. Meanwhile, he was checking in with our mutual friend regularly. If I send a message inviting him for coffee or sharing something fun, I get nothing back. But if I run into him in person, he acts normal—friendly, even—but there’s this invisible wall between us that I don’t understand.

I wish I could talk to him about it, but past experiences make me hesitant. Any time I’ve tried to bring up concerns before, he brushes them off with things like, “I have to stay true to myself” or something along the lines of ""I support you, just from afar."" It makes it really hard to have an actual conversation about what’s going on.

Now, here’s where things took a turn.

A while back, I had an experience with someone—let’s call him Michael. Without getting into too much detail, he was extremely pushy in a way that made me feel unsafe. At one point, he was even verbally aggressive toward me. It shook me up, especially since he lived near me, and I wasn’t sure how to handle it. I confided in George about the situation, and he reassured me, making me feel like he understood how upsetting it had been.

But then, just a few days later, I ran into George, and he casually mentioned that he had grabbed coffee with Michael.

To be clear, these two didn’t know each other before me. They were aware of each other’s existence through me, but that was it. Apparently, they ran into each other at a café, and instead of just exchanging pleasantries, they sat down and had a full conversation.

I was stunned. I didn’t know what to say in the moment, so I just kept walking. But later, when we sat down to talk, I told him that while he could be friends with whoever he wanted, I was struggling with the fact that he would actively choose to spend time with someone who had treated me that way.

His response? He doubled down on how he prioritizes his own choices above all else. He started going on about how he needs to be loyal to himself first and foremost. That was when I really started to feel like something had shifted between us.

Since then, he’s been even more distant. I don’t know if this is just who he’s become or if I’m reading too much into it. Part of me wonders if I should just let the friendship fade, but another part of me still wants to understand what happened.

Am I wrong to feel hurt by this? Or am I overreacting?

\--   
  
**TL;DR:** My friend of 10+ years has become distant, ignores my messages, and befriended someone who made me feel unsafe. I'm not sure how to handle it or if I’m overreacting.",1,1739373611.0,relationships,7,1.0,False

Can you crack BITSAT in 4 months? Fuck yeah, if you morph into a caffeine-guzzling, textbook-fucking cyborg. Here’s the raw blueprint:



1. Syllabus Rape: BITSAT’s syllabus is a beast, but you’ve gotta skull-fuck it into submission. Split the 120 days:

Month 1: Butcher NCERTs. It’s the holy grail—drill Physics, Chem, Math like your life depends on it (hint: it does).

Month 2: Mock test gangbang. Hit previous years’ papers daily—time yourself like a Dom with a stopwatch.

Month 3: Weakness annihilation. Failed integration? Choke it with 50 problems a day.

Month 4: Speed drills. BITSAT’s a 3-hour sprint—solve problems while taking a piss to simulate pressure.

2. Physics:

Electrostatics, Optics, Modern Physics are point-whores. Master them.

Calculators aren’t allowed, so crunch numbers like a street vendor on meth.

3. Chemistry:

Organic—flowcharts or die.

Inorganic—binge formulas like Netflix.

Physical—problems, problems, problems.

4. Math:

Calculus, Algebra = 70% of the paper. Grind until your hand cramps.

Shit like Probability? Skip if time’s tight—triage like a war medic.

5. English/Logic:

Grammar Nazis Win: Practice error-spotting while taking a shit.

Logic Puzzles: Solve Sudoku with your non-dominant hand to fry your brain into agility.

6. Mock Tests:

Take one daily. Review mistakes by slapping yourself—pain embeds lessons.

7. Lifestyle:

Sleep 6 hours. Drink coffee intravenously. Social life? Delete it—your friends are vectors and benzene rings now.

8. Mindset:

Fear is fuel. Dream of getting roasted by relatives if you fail—let shame motor your grind.

Real talk: 4 months is hell, but doable. Sacrifice your humanity, worship the syllabus, and BITS Pilani will be your bitch. Now go—turn your brain into a fucking spreadsheet.  write this",16,1739373243.0,Bitsatards,7,0.9,False

I am trying to utilize a importrange wrapped by a query to bring in data from a standardized sheet used to track sales at different locations. 

The sheet the importrange is used in is a Sales Tracker Sheet, acting as a repository for several individual sales sheets.

Each sale sheet (in this ex. the tab titles ""Coffee Cart Sales"") has a date placed in Cell B1 which allows for the headers starting in D5:O5 to be dynamic. Sales values for each corresponding store and month are totaled in cells D6:O9 in the appropriate cell.

The issue I am running into is when bringing the values (query(importrange formula in cells C2:C on the ""Tracker"" tab) from this sheet into the sales repository (the tab titled ""Tracker"") is that I am unable to write a formula that matches the headers in D5:O5 to the headers in E1:P1 to bring in the correct value for a store and month.

I have linked the sheet below to be copied. I understand that the use of an importrange in this example is not necessary as the data is in the same sheet, but the ""Tracker"" tab will be it's own sheet, hence the need to an importrange. Thank you!

1insziy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1insziy,Labs brushed off by Doctor?,"Hello,

For context, I (27F) have a very infrequent period (once a year maybe) and when it happens it lasts for like 2 + weeks and is extremely heavy (no pain).

This last happened in April 2024 and my blood was taken. I was diagnosed with PCOS but I also had some unusual thyroid results (see images).

My Dr brushed it off as an effect of my period (?) but I've been having symptoms recently that seem to point to hyperthryoidism? See below:

- Lost 4kg in a month despite being more sedentary 

- Recently, urinating extremely often i.e. 3 times just before bed and 3 times in the night.

- Excessive sweating even when still.

- Overheating very easily, even having to use the fan at night (my partner is totally comfortable/cool)

- On and off I get really out of breath when walking and have to mouth-breathe or pause. Often get a stitch. 

- Alopecia Areata (not sure if relevant).

- Vertical brown lines on my nails (not sure if relevant).

I will be contacting my GP tomorrow because I tried walking to a coffee shop today and the breathlessness scared me (UK based so can't contact sooner). Plus I'm sweaty all the f*ing time! 

I guess I'm looking for validation that I'm not just anxious or going insane??? 😅 as someone with an iffy period, I'm just a bit wary of doctors. Do you think this is hyperthyrodism? And should it have been investigated back in April?

Also if anyone has experience of the UK based treatment route, I'd really appreciate it :')) thank you!",1,1739372959.0,Hyperthyroidism,0,1.0,False

Pa rant lang ng aking malasjuicy. Isang today at isa last November ata. Bare with me since di ako magaling mag kwento.

Yung today:
May nakilala ako sa reddit from her post na looking for hangout or something. So ayun we exchange pics, sabi nya okay naman daw itsura ko for my age. Looking din daw siya for friend na mag tutulungan for like health,  gym and diet pero kung di daw yan, pwede din naman daw na exclusive dating. So ako I'm fine with that since I'm single naman. So nag aya ako kahapon ng coffee near kung san siya nag aaral. But she countered with na bukas nalang (today) ng 9 am but sa Bulacan, ako willing naman to travel and gusto ko din siya makilala personally. I said yes. Then she countered again na sa sm grand nalang ng 1130 am. So fast forward today: I make it a point na tuwing may date ako, lagi akong 15 mins to 30 mins early. So mga 1050 am nasa SM na ako. Sabi nya malate lang siya at nag ba byahe pa. So sabi ko: "" sige ingat ka, take your time"" aba grabe okay naman sana malate like 30 mins to 1 hr. Pero 1 hr na wala pa din. So nag follow up chat ako. Sabi nya 15 mins andito na siya. So sabi ko ulit sige I'll wait nalang sa resto kung san tayo kakaen. Ayun 1 hour ulit lumipas di pa dn dumadating and di man lang nag uupdate or what. So nang  after 2 plus hours na ako nag aantay from the time na she sets to meet. Nag chat na ako na sabi ko na nag sabi nalang sana siya ng no kaysa nag flake siya sakin and 2 hours siyang wala. Then bumili nalang ako ng dessert sa resto (since 1 hour ako naka tambay dun) and umalis. After ilang mins nag chat siya na san na ako at sabi ko daw ""mag wait"" daw ako sa kanya. Yes sinabi ko yun pero diba have a common courtesy naman sa mga tao. 2 hours plus wala siya from her time na sinet nya. Not counting na 30 plus mins na early ako. Like nakaka inis kasi may mga work or other things tayong pinag kaka abalahan para ganunin ka.

Almost same thing din last November. Nag post ako ng LF for runningxcoffee buddy. May nakausap ako okay naman. She told me kung kailan siya available for run. Then the day ng run, 1 hr before the run she cancelled but sabi nya coffee nalang ng 7pm and nag send din siya kung san nya gusto. By 6pm naka bihis na ako and ready to go.

1insvhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBeanReviews/comments/1insvhb/best_reusable_coffee_filter_lhs_ls0071s_review_is/,Best reusable coffee filter LHS LS007-1-S review: Is it worth your brew?,"I’ve been using the LHS LS007-1-S reusable coffee filter for a couple of weeks now, and let me just say—my mornings have changed. As someone who enjoys a daily pour-over ritual but hates the constant need for paper filters, this stainless steel cone filter has been a game-changer for me. It’s compact, eco-friendly, and surprisingly efficient at brewing a flavorful cup of coffee.

The setup is straightforward. I simply rinse the filter with hot water, add my preferred coffee grounds, and pour boiling water over it. The fine mesh ensures that no coffee grounds sneak into the cup, which is something I deeply appreciate. Plus, the included non-slip base makes it stable on most mugs, even my oddly-shaped travel cup. I tested it extensively at home, at work, and even on a camping trip—it’s portable and lightweight, which is a huge plus for someone always on the go.

What surprised me most is how quickly it brews. The water flows smoothly through the fine mesh without clogging, delivering a strong, aromatic coffee in just a few minutes. I’ve tried it with both coarser and finer grinds, and while it works best with a medium grind, it still manages to handle espresso grounds reasonably well. Cleaning is a breeze too—just rinse it under hot water and give it a wipe, or toss it in the dishwasher for a deeper clean. The included cleaning brush is a thoughtful touch, making it easy to scrub out stubborn coffee oils.

[Find the best price for LHS LS007-1-S on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-reusable-filter-lhs-ls007-1-s-review-b07mx87hh9/)

**Pros**

* The reusable stainless steel mesh eliminates the need for paper filters, saving money and reducing waste.
* Lightweight and portable design makes it perfect for travel or camping trips.
* Easy to clean—dishwasher safe and comes with a handy cleaning brush.
* Fits a variety of mug sizes, thanks to the wide, stable base.
* Brews quickly with no grounds in the coffee.

**Cons**

* The mesh is fine but not perfect—occasionally, a tiny bit of residue slips through with finer grinds.
* It’s a single-wall filter, so it doesn’t retain heat as well as double-wall competitors.
* Some users report variability in brew times due to differences in mesh density.
* Not ideal for those who prefer very coarse or very fine grinds—it works best with medium grind coffee.

**Comparison to Competitors** Compared to other reusable coffee filters like the Hario V60 or the Bodum Pour Over, the LHS LS007-1-S stands out for its affordability and ease of use. The Hario V60, for instance, requires paper filters and is less portable. On the other hand, the Bodum Pour Over includes a double-wall design, which retains heat better but comes at a higher price point. While the LHS filter doesn't provide the same heat retention, it excels in portability and simplicity, making it a great choice for casual coffee drinkers or travelers.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money** When it comes to value, this filter delivers. It’s priced at a point that’s accessible for most coffee enthusiasts and pays for itself quickly when you consider the savings on paper filters. Its durable stainless steel construction means you won’t have to replace it any time soon, making it a worthwhile investment for your brewing routine. While it might not be the cheapest reusable coffee filter out there, the combination of quality and convenience justifies the cost.

1insvh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestCoffeeTables/comments/1insvh7/a_practical_review_of_the_fdw_lift_top_coffee/,A Practical Review of the FDW Lift Top Coffee Table,"Testing the FDW Lift Top Coffee Table with Hidden Compartment and Storage Shelf has been an experience full of surprises and realizations. I’ve had the chance to use it daily in my living room, and I must admit, it’s not just a furniture piece—it’s become a functional part of my daily routine.

The design of this coffee table is strikingly modern with a subtle rustic charm. The brown melamine veneer finish is both aesthetically pleasing and practical as it resists scratches and everyday wear. The engineered wood construction combined with metal mechanisms gives it a sturdy feel, and though the table isn’t customizable, its sleek, rectangular shape fits effortlessly into most living room setups.

Measuring 39 inches in depth, 28 inches in width, and 24 inches in height when fully extended, its dimensions are perfect for medium to larger living spaces. The lift-top feature is a game-changer. It glides smoothly, thanks to the slow-down air rods, and provides a comfortable workspace or dining area. I’ve used it for everything from typing on my laptop to enjoying meals in front of the TV. Beneath the tabletop, the hidden compartment is a lifesaver for storing clutter like remote controls, magazines, or even my kids’ art supplies. The open lower shelf adds another layer of functionality for blankets or knick-knacks.

**Ease of Maintenance**

Cleaning this coffee table is a breeze. The surface is resistant to stains, and a quick wipe with a damp cloth is all it takes to keep it looking new. However, I did notice that smudges and fingerprints can become visible, especially under direct light, so frequent cleaning might be needed for a pristine look.

**Assembly Experience**

Let me share a bit about the assembly. While the product comes with all the necessary hardware and an Allen wrench, assembling it wasn’t exactly a walk in the park. The instructions rely solely on images, which can be confusing. Partnering up with a friend or using an electric screwdriver speeds up the process significantly. It took me around three hours to put it together, and while it was a rewarding experience in the end, a clearer manual would have been a huge help.

**Pros**

1. **Functional Design**: The lift-top mechanism is incredibly convenient for multitasking and adds versatility.
2. **Ample Storage**: A hidden compartment and lower shelf ensure a clutter-free living room.
3. **Durability**: The engineered wood and metal build provide a sturdy and reliable structure.
4. **Stylish Look**: The brown veneer finish blends seamlessly with both modern and rustic décor.

**Cons**

1. **Challenging Assembly**: Confusing instructions and difficulty in aligning certain parts made setup tedious.
2. **Top Stability**: The lift-top wobbles slightly if not pulled from the center.
3. **Weight**: At 53 pounds, the coffee table is on the heavier side, requiring two people to move it safely.
4. **Fingerprints**: The veneer surface tends to attract smudges, demanding frequent cleaning.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other lift-top coffee tables like the WLIVE Wood Lift Top Coffee Table or the Yaheetech Lift Top Table, this one stands out for its noise-reducing air rods and sturdy build. While the WLIVE model offers a similar hidden compartment, its assembly process is reportedly more straightforward. However, the FDW table feels more solid and durable in daily use. On the other hand, the Yaheetech model features a slightly smoother lift-top operation but doesn’t offer the same level of style and finish.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Given the features, the FDW Lift Top Coffee Table offers excellent value for its price. It’s not the cheapest option on the market, but the combination of design, functionality, and durability makes it a solid investment for anyone looking to enhance their living space. Be prepared to spend a little extra time on assembly, but the end result is worth it.

**Features in Action**

The lift-top mechanism is the highlight, enabling a seamless transition between a coffee table and a workspace. The pneumatic support system ensures quiet operation, perfect for a shared living room. With a maximum load capacity of 250 pounds, the table easily handles heavier items without any wobble. The rectangular design with straight legs adds stability, and the engineered wood material feels premium to the touch.

1insvh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1insvh3/mr_coffee_2150023_review_a_reliable_coffee_maker/,Mr. Coffee 2150023 review: A reliable coffee maker with impressive features,"Testing the Mr. Coffee 2150023, also known as the Stainless Steel 10-Cup Programmable Thermal Coffee Maker, has been a daily ritual for me over the past couple of months. As someone who values a hot, flavorful brew in the morning—and sometimes mid-afternoon—I was excited to see how this programmable coffee machine would fare in real-world use. While it delivers on several promises, there are notable quirks to consider.

The design strikes a balance between sleek aesthetics and functionality. Its stainless steel finish not only looks modern but also resists fingerprints and smudges, a bonus for anyone who hates constant wiping. I appreciated the sturdy build, especially the double-walled thermal carafe. It feels durable and keeps coffee hot for hours without the need for a warming plate. The downside? The carafe's lid design can make pouring a bit slower than expected. Imagine waiting a few extra seconds while trying to pour your first cup of caffeine for the day—a mild annoyance, but worth mentioning.

[Check Mr. Coffee 2150023 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/mr-coffee-2150023-review-b08mx4xg97/)

Performance-wise, this coffee maker excels in brewing both speed and flavor. The Optimal Brew feature ensures coffee is brewed at up to 205°F, extracting rich flavors more efficiently than many competitors. I tested the Strong Brew selector, which is perfect for those mornings when I need an extra bold kick. However, some users might find the coffee a tad weaker than expected if they don't use the Strong Brew option. The consistency in brewing is commendable, as every pot tasted just as good as the last.

When it comes to customization and controls, the machine offers a straightforward interface. The programmable timer is a lifesaver, letting me wake up to freshly brewed coffee without lifting a finger. The freshness timer, while innovative, feels gimmicky at times. Am I really checking how many minutes have passed since brewing? Not often. The dimmable clock is a thoughtful touch, though the delay timer’s bright light could use a dimmer option as well.

Ease of use is another area where this coffee maker shines. The removable water reservoir makes refilling a breeze, even in tight kitchen spaces. Cleaning and maintenance are equally simple. The thermal carafe and removable filter basket rinse clean easily, while the machine’s descaling reminder ensures it stays in top shape.

The compact size is a blessing for my crowded countertop. Despite its 10-cup capacity, the machine doesn’t dominate the space. The water reservoir and bean hopper are well-sized for a household of daily coffee drinkers, though larger families might wish for a bit more capacity.

**Pros**

1. The thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for hours without burning the flavor.
2. Programmable timer and Strong Brew selector add convenience and versatility.
3. Stainless steel design resists rust and smudges, maintaining a clean look.
4. Removable water reservoir simplifies refilling and cleaning tasks.
5. Compact and space-efficient, making it ideal for smaller kitchens.

**Cons**

1. The carafe pours slower than expected due to its lid design.
2. The freshness timer feels unnecessary for many users.
3. Bright delay timer light could be distracting in dimly lit rooms.
4. Coffee strength might not satisfy everyone without the Strong Brew option.
5. Gimmicky water filter dial requires frequent replacements for effectiveness.

Comparing this coffee maker to competitors like the Cuisinart DCC-3400 or the Breville Precision Brewer, the Mr. Coffee 2150023 holds its own in terms of affordability and simplicity. The Cuisinart, for instance, offers a larger carafe and more advanced brewing options but comes at a steeper price. On the other hand, Breville’s model delivers unparalleled customization, though it might overwhelm users who prefer a more straightforward device. In contrast, Mr. Coffee strikes a great middle ground—ideal for those who want solid performance without complexity.

From a cost perspective, this coffee machine offers excellent value for money. It sits comfortably between budget models and high-end machines, delivering features like a thermal carafe and programmable settings that are often found in pricier options. If you’re looking for a reliable coffee maker that doesn’t break the bank, this is a solid contender.

Features like the Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause are a small but thoughtful addition. There were mornings when I just couldn’t wait for the full pot to brew, and this feature allowed me to sneak a cup early. Meanwhile, the absence of a heating plate ensures that the coffee never turns bitter from prolonged exposure to heat. The water filtration system is a nice touch, although its impact might go unnoticed in areas with good tap water. Filters are easy to replace, but skipping them doesn’t seem to affect flavor significantly.

Overall, this product is a practical addition to any kitchen. My children even commented on how ""fancy"" it looks, which speaks volumes about its aesthetic appeal. It’s not perfect, but for everyday use, it’s dependable and offers a superior experience compared to many entry-level coffee makers.

I found this reddit by a coincidence, but it''s along the lines of something I need to work with.
I'm a low key shopaholic (not diagnosed), buying stuff makes me kinda happy. I use it to cope, I love buying new things. I often times feel an urge to buy, kinda like an addiction.
Because of me and my boyfriend studying, we don't have a lot of money, and often times we run out in the middle of the month. I need to cut down on my spending. I got buying expensive stuff almost under control with a ""no buying anything this month"" rule. I'm only allowed to buy groceries.
But instead of buying more expensive things, i just buy a lot of inexpensive things. An extra cup of coffee, fast food, snacks for the cat and for us, and it all runs up to too much money every month anyways.
I just want to ask, how do I start with nobuy? Are there any litterature or an essential post I missed? What is this subreddit about? 
I am perfectly able to make a budget and I always pay all my bills, but I spend med ""free"" money too fast. I need to get it under control.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\

He was like, “what I do to distress is, while you’re at work and the kids are at school, I run around the house singing/dancing like an idiot. You should try it!”

It was well-intentioned, but my heart sunk, bc that *used to be* one of my go-tos. He didn’t consider I never have that option bc he’s wfh. The only recent alone times I can think of were when I was ill and he went without me to some social/family events. I think lying in bed sick does not count. Other suggestions I’ve read are usually like “go for a walk! Visit a coffee shop!” but that doesn’t solve the problem. I want ACTUAL ALONE TIME in my comfort zone (my home). I can’t dance down the sidewalk belting out Fiona Apple. I don’t want to do that in front of my husband, let alone my neighbors.

I feel like I always have to be “on.” We have shared custody with our exes, and when the kids are here, they’re on my ass from the second they’re home from school to bedtime. When I’m at work, I’m required to socialize with multiple people, sometimes two at a time. It’s gotten to the point I’ve started locking myself in the bathroom for over an hour here and there, just to be ALONE. But it’s not the same as having the house to myself. 

I’m not mad at my husband, and he’s not trying to argue I’m wrong. He had a bit of a lightbulb moment after his tone-deaf suggestion, and offered to go to work Mondays (my day off), but then I’ll feel guilty bc I know he hates going in. On the other hand, it seems a small concession to make considering he’ll still have the house to himself T-F. I don’t know what to do! Am I being unreasonable? My husband is wonderful and wants to be accommodating, but it feels like a no-win situation. Do I take him up on the offer and risk him resenting me for it, or suck it up and risk me resenting him? I love him so much, but I just want to vacuum in my underwear to unreasonably loud music without an audience sometimes. Is that too much to ask? ",25,1739372387.0,workingmoms,27,0.93,False

Vetting isn’t about making subs “prove” themselves—it’s about ensuring a dynamic that’s fulfilling, sustainable, and safe for both of us.","**Finding the Right Fit: Why I Vet My Subs**

Vetting isn’t about making subs “prove” themselves—it’s about ensuring a dynamic that’s fulfilling, sustainable, and safe for both of us. I take the time to ask questions, even if a sub tributes right away. Not every sub is the right fit, and I won’t agree to something without clear boundaries that protect my vanilla life and, most importantly, my mental health.

Here’s what I look for:  
✨ **Time Compatibility** – I’m a *rested* Goddess. My availability matters. If you prefer late-night interactions, we won’t align. I need a sub whose schedule fits mine—someone who respects my time instead of demanding attention when I’m unavailable.

✨ **Financial Control, Not Just Tribute** – Silent sends and occasional coffees are fine, but I want something deeper. I manage properties, invest, and plan for the future—I expect a sub who values my guidance in financial matters, not just someone who wants to throw money at me with no real connection.

✨ **Mutual Fit** – Not every sub belongs at my feet, and that’s okay. If I sense that you’d be better suited for another Goddess, I’ll gladly pass you along. The right dynamic is about synergy, not desperation.

If you’re looking for something real, something structured, something that prioritizes *both* of our needs—then I’m listening. But if you’re just looking for a faceless tribute drop, keep searching. I know my worth, and I expect my subs to know it too. 💸💋",2,1739372370.0,MoneyMistresses,1,1.0,False

The first strange event happened when I was alone in our computer room playing some old FPS with my buddies when I got a whole body chill and noticed my hairs stand up on my arms and legs. Didn't really bother me until the laundry basket that was on the floor next to me just tipped over by itself. Weird, sure but then I look at my right arm which was the same side as the laundry basket and I noticed 3 scratch marks on my right arm, not bloody but very apparent. Those three scratch like marks freaked me out (they almost looked like when you press down on sunburnt skin but did not immediately disappear, and I didn't touch my arm). I remember telling my parents about it as I was absolutely terrified, my mom believed me but my dad was skeptical.

Fast forward about 5 hours into the night and my dad  and mother are both woken up by the sound of our coffee machine cover getting flipped up and down repeatedly, which then ended up getting louder as it sounded like it had moved to the bottom of the stairs. My dad went downstairs to see what the commotion was about but absolutely nothing seemed out of place. Our cat at the time was in their bed, as was our dog so that wouldn't have made sense (this portion is from my parents account which to this day they still confirm what they experienced to be true). I remember my dad telling me about this the next morning and he seemed ...scared which I found odd as he is not religious or spiritual in any sense. 

Fast forward to literally the very next night and my mother and father are woken up by me in their room sleep walking (which I have absolutely zero record of ever doing before these events and after...). My parents described my actions as though I were possessed by a woman as I was clearly asleep but was trying to talk to them but they couldn't understand me. They said I was moving like a woman (flaunting hips, walking very feminine like). Being smart my parents did not interfere but just observed until I went back to my bed and proceeded to tell my parents to ""get my gun"" and to ""get away from me"" because ""something was wrong"". This basically ended in my mother having the house cleansed multiple times and nothing strange really ever happened again after this cleansing. 

Sorry if this isn't the most well put together description but I thought I would share as it's something that still freaks me out to this day.

Feb 12, 2025

# Beyond Germany: Other international markets for cannabis opportunities

While Germany is often the first non-North American country that comes to mind when discussing global cannabis opportunities, it’s far from the only one.

Take the European Union, for example. The partnership, which currently includes 27 countries, has taken a very formal approach to allowing cannabis use across the union, according to Jamie Pearson, founder of global consulting firm New Holland Group.

Pearson told Green Market Report that she was able to fill a cannabis prescription while overseas, and with her medical card, she can carry cannabis with her – even in Switzerland which is not an EU member.

“What’s exciting is that the recreational pilot programs are starting, so they’re fully underway in Switzerland, fully underway in the Netherlands,” Pearson said. “They’re all doing it in conjunction with universities and doing data analysis of different elements of the program, and they’re going to use five years of data or 10 years of data to inform how the final law should be written.”

The global opportunities may be growing, but each market still has its own distinct approach to fostering cannabis business opportunities.

International outlook

Australia

Australia legalized the cultivation of cannabis for medicinal and scientific purposes in 2016. Since then, “Australia has been a strong medical market for operators driven by patient growth in the Authorized Prescriber (AP) pathway,” Alliance Global Partners wrote.

Patient approvals were expected to reach roughly 800,000 in 2024, which would be up 21% from 2023.

“Outside of greater medical patients and prescribers, operators under coverage would benefit from reduced competition via greater enforcement from the government on noncompliant products in the marketplace (i.e., not GMP certified),” the firm wrote.

Israel

On April 1, 2024, Israel implemented medical cannabis reform that switched cannabis to a prescription model rather than a license model. This allows all specialists to prescribe cannabis and for cannabis to no longer be a last resort medication. As a result, the number of patient licenses in the country reached an all-time high of 137,940 in December 2024.

Israel had become a huge importer of cannabis, but in November 2024, the Israeli Ministry of Economy proposed a 175% anti-dumping levy on imported cannabis from Canada to protect local growers and manufacturers. This has resulted in some companies reducing their exposure to the market.

The Israel-Hamas War also created disruption in the region, with at least one operator – InterCure – reporting direct damage.

Czech Republic

Medical marijuana has been legal in the Czech Republic since 2013, but the program is slated to expand in April, with general practitioners allowed to prescribe medical cannabis rather that just specialized doctors.

The country is supplied in part by imports from Canadian operators like Tilray and Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ: ACB).

Denmark

Denmark initiated a four-year medical cannabis pilot program in January 2018 and then extended  it through 2025. However in November 2024, Denmark’s government announced plans to make the medical pilot program permanent.

Aurora has established a significant presence in Denmark through its subsidiary, Aurora Nordic Cannabis A/S, based in Odense. Avicanna (OTC: AVCNF) also has a subsidiary in the country and has completed exports of its Aureus-branded cannabigerol (CBG) into Denmark, contributing to the diversity of medical cannabis products available in the country.

France

AGP noted in its outlook that France recently extended its medical cannabis pilot program (1,800 patients) by seven months, meaning it will now end on July 31.

“France’s official medical cannabis program was expected to launch in 2025, but now remains uncertain as it was not mentioned in the country’s budget, amid political change in the country,” the report noted.

Companies that do business in France include: Aurora, Tilray, UK-based Emmac Life Sciences and Australian companies Althea and Little Green Pharma.

Luxembourg

Luxembourg became the second European nation to fully legalize adult-use cannabis by way of parliament in 2023. The rules allowed for limited possession and consumption, as well as self-cultivation.

According to Cannintelligence, “Luxembourg is undergoing changes in its medical cannabis regulations. Starting in January 2025, the country plans to discontinue prescriptions for high-THC cannabis flowers, shifting the focus to oil extracts for patient safety and precise dosing.”

Companies that export to Luxembourg include Aurora, Tilray and Canopy Growth.

Malta

Malta became the first European nation to fully legalize marijuana by way of a parliamentary vote in 2021. Sales are strictly limited to nonprofit organizations with a monthly limit of 50 grams of product per customer each month and 250 members per club.

Still, Canadian company Aphria was issued the first medicinal cannabis producer license in Malta, and an Israeli company, Panaxia, has established a production facility in Malta.

Netherlands

Medical cannabis has been legal in the Netherlands since 2003 and recreational use is “tolerated” in coffee shops across the country.

The Netherlands officially launched its adult-use cannabis pilot program in 10 cities in 2023 – an effort to formalize the framework. In April, that program will move to the experimental phase, where only 10 licensed cultivators will be allowed to supply the coffee shops; sales of unregulated products will no longer allowed.

Several Canadian companies have established themselves in the country, including Village Farms International through its subsidiary Leli Holland. Aurora, through its subsidiary Aurora Nederland B.V., acquired a significant equity stake in Growery B.V., one of the 10 license holders in the Dutch experiment.

Poland

Poland legalized medical cannabis in 2017, allowing doctors to prescribe the plant to patients and sales occurring through pharmacies. For 2024, the country nearly doubled its medical cannabis import limits.

U.S.-based Curaleaf expanded into the Polish market by acquiring Can4Med, a pharmaceutical wholesaler specializing in cannabinoid medications. Aurora Cannabis has registered four flower varieties, and Canopy Growth has registered two.

Switzerland

Switzerland allows medical marijuana and cannabis flower with less than 1% THC, which it calls CBD cannabis.

The country is also currently running seven adult-use pilot programs with more than 17,000 participants. The most recent and largest pilot (7,500 participants) will occur in Zurich in May.

In academia, we already spend a lot of time alone writing and researching, so if we also have to eat alone and have coffee breaks alone, it becomes really difficult.

So I wanted to just post something that I hope will help anyone feeling a little lost, or like their route to weight loss is getting a little tough.

March 2023, I stepped on the scales for the first time in over a year. It flashed up. **345.5.** I was stumped. In shock perhaps. For reference, I was 26 at the time, and am **5'5 and a female**. I hit rock bottom, genuinely. Although I was crawling around there for a while.

Outwardly, I was confident, referring to myself as 'fat', pretending to not care. Loud and funny, certain of herself.

Inwardly, I was dying. Walking more than 5 minutes caused severe back pain. I was always sweating, out of breath constantly. I couldn't breath at night due to the fat on my chest and around my neck. I hated leaving the house, going for a food shop, going for coffees, exploring a new town. Essentially, living life. Everything was beyond uncomfortable, it was painful.

To cope, I drank most weekend, partied to try and forget how much I hated the prison I was in. I had a job that had me on my feet all day, but the second I got through that door in the evening, I ate. Every day was centred around food. I followed the body positive movement (no hate, I believe no one should feel shame about their bodies), but it actually enabled me. I told myself 'nothing is wrong with me, it is okay to be fat'. And yes, morally there is nothing wrong with me. I am not a morally superior woman now than I was at 345.5 pounds. But that isn't the point. I wasn't living anymore. Online, I saw other fat women post themselves and they looked so confident. I thought that I wasn't trying 'hard enough' to love myself like they could.

So one day, I started counting calories, and I haven't stopped. I took it day by day, and thought, today, I am a little closer to a happier and healthier me. I started going for small walks, and these became longer and a little faster. I started talking to some trusted people about my feelings. I planned my next day. I then started thinking about how I could get more protein in, then more water.

I celebrated the wins, and didn't beat myself up over any blips or 'stalls'. I forgot the timeline, and broke my weight loss into little chunks. I thought 'wow, can't wait to get into the next 10's of pounds (eg. 280 - 279), or the next stone bracket.

I never stopped getting my hair done, or my nails done. I focused on wearing what I felt comfortable in for that day. I laughed, I listened to good music, drank good coffee, and started going on adventures again.

I look back on myself from two years ago, and my initial reaction is 'god, how did I get there, I looked awful' I have had some people say similar things. But like with them, I stop myself and go, 'it was that version of me that took the first step, not this version of me. The only thing wrong with me was that I was lost'.

I can't believe how good life is now. I have found pockets of happiness or content in the every day life, mostly! Because that is where the change is - in your day. Get today right, and you'll get to where you want to be. But please know, each day is one step closer. I am so delighted that I have taken that first step.

There were moments that I thought 'this is too hard, I want to live a little'. But living, to me, was learning some discipline and reaching for that delayed gratification instead of the instant kind. I am strong, resilient and capable of great things.

Please keep going, focus on the day, get it right and you can't go wrong.

My ultimate goal is 150, and I know I will get there. But I am focusing on today, and the next week so I can plan for anything that may be a challenge. I am excited. And always reminding myself of how my life has improved beyond my body.

Some tips that have helped me:

1. Plan out tomorrow. I know what I will have for each meal, along with when I will do my walk. I lay out my clothes for work, along with my walking clothes. I have meal prepped and everything is ready to go.
2. Focus on the day. I keep saying it, but seriously. How can you make your day a successful one? What does that look like to you. It is easy for my mind to run and say 'oh my god, I have X pounds to lose still'. Okay yes that is true. But I am going to focus on today, as this will get me a little closer. I can focus on the inputs.
3. Calorie tracking. Before losing weight, there were days I was CONVINCED I wasn't eating 'that' much. The modern body pos/fat movement convinced me that I was meant to be this way. I wasn't. I was eating so much junk food, that it didn't appear like a lot at times, and I was always 'hungry' for actual nutrition.
4. Not every day will be perfect, that is okay. There have been days and periods of time (hello Christmas) where I wasn't eating in a caloric deficit, or going for my daily walk. That's okay, I just back to it. It is helpful to give yourself a time period of not tracking. Over Christmas, I chose the days overall where I wouldn't track. And I knew which days I was getting back to my normal routine. This helps a lot. Stick to it. I know that I am going away for a weekend next month. Friday and Saturday will not be tracked. That's okay. I am going for my food shop Sunday, I know what I like to eat on a weekly basis. Having a deadline for yourself is key!
5. It's all about those habits. Doing something most days, such as your caloric deficit or your walk, will get you to where you want to be. It's simple, not easy. You don't need to do anything crazy, it's just a bit boring at times. Find comfort in that.
6. Dress for the you TODAY. Don't stop taking care of yourself. Showing myself that I am a human that should always be treated with kindness and respect has really built up my self confidence. I used to have zero. I remind myself to walk with confidence. Some days are better than others. But this has really helped me to understand that there is no 'good' and 'bad' versions of myself!
7. Take that focus away from your physical looks. I used to think 'I have to go for this walk to burn calories', and now I think 'I get to go on my walk, I feel good mentally and helps with my stress levels, those happy chemicals really help me!'
8. Following/reading weight loss material that feels GOOD for you. I looked at what I was reading and who I was following. I don't want to have a super ripped or toned body. I wanted to find people, women especially that lost a lot of weight, and are realistic for me. This forum helps me to focus on the positive, and it's great seeing those who have walked before me.

Thanks for reading, any tips you would give? And again, not every day is perfect. I am always learning. But taking a break for a moment and looking back, I am so proud of myself. I am proud of all of you!",43,1739371709.0,SuperMorbidlyObese,2,0.96,False
1insh6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1insh6z/have_you_ever_cheated_and_kept_it_a_secret_does/,Have you ever cheated and kept it a secret? Does the guilt ever go away?,"I Cheated, and No One Knows—Not Even Her

Throwaway because I can never admit this to anyone.

I never saw myself as the kind of guy who would cheat. I had a stable marriage, a wife who loved me, and a life that looked good from the outside. But somehow, it happened. And the strangest part? No one—not my wife, not her husband, not even my closest friends—ever found out.

It started unexpectedly. Sneha and I had been college friends. Just that. She got married young, moved away, and we lost touch. I married Nisha, settled into life, and never thought about her again.

Then, years later, we ran into each other at a work event in Delhi.

""Arjun?!"" she said, eyes widening in surprise.

We caught up over coffee, laughing about how much had changed. She was back in Mumbai, her husband constantly traveling. I told her about my job, my marriage, the usual. Before we left, she said, ""Let’s not lose touch this time,"" and we exchanged numbers.

The texts started casually—memes, work rants, random check-ins. But slowly, things shifted. Late-night conversations turned deeper. She once texted, ""Ever feel like you're just existing, not living?""

I stared at the screen for a long time before replying: ""Every single day.""

That was the beginning.

At first, we met for coffee. Then dinner. Then, one evening, she invited me over—“Just dinner,” she had said. It was raining, I remember. The wine flowed, and the conversation turned quiet. A charged silence. She looked at me, and I knew what was about to happen.

I should have left. But I didn’t.

What followed wasn’t some grand love story. It was quiet, careful, and temporary. No unnecessary texts, no risky calls. We never spoke about the future, never made promises we couldn’t keep. We existed in stolen moments, knowing it couldn’t last.

And then, one night, reality hit me.

At dinner, Nisha casually mentioned a colleague’s affair that had ruined his marriage. “I don’t get how people do this,” she said, shaking her head. “How do you live with that kind of guilt?”

I forced a chuckle. “Some people are just wired differently, I guess.”

That night, I texted Sneha.

“We need to stop.”

She took a while to reply. When she did, it was just one word:

""I know.""

We never spoke again.

Life moved on. My marriage remained intact. To this day, Nisha doesn’t know. Neither does her husband. It’s as if it never happened.

But sometimes, when my phone buzzes late at night, I still feel that split-second rush—just before I remind myself that it’s never her. And it never will be.

1insgse,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1insgse/mil_shows_zero_interest_in_pregnancy_of_her_first/,Mil shows zero interest in pregnancy of her first grand baby,"Anyone else have a mil display zero interest in their pregnancy or coming of their grandchildren?
 

My husband and i told my in laws we were expecting at about 13 weeks. We held off on telling them sooner due to my mil making an angry comment “I hope not.” to my aunt at our wedding when my aunt said she hopes we come back pregnant from the honeymoon. 
We were also forced to tell them we were pregnant sooner than what we wanted due to my in-laws planning a surprise last minute trip out of the country for the whole family. We told them on FaceTime due to us being forced to give an answer if we’re going to go on the family vacation. We are sadly unable to go with it not being safe for me to travel internationally during that point of my pregnancy. 

My mil reaction to us being pregnant was not very exciting. Shes a very extra person and will show her emotions when shes excited. We told them while on facetime and her response is “ohhh congratulations.” with a small smile. My fil never said anything i believe, my sister in laws were happy for us. 
My husband said she had a bigger reaction to him buying a house, as in she was jumping, hugging him, and squealing excitedly. But for her to find out we are expecting their first grandchild and first grandchild in their whole family she didn’t have a reaction considering how she is. 
After we told her on FaceTime she never asked any questions or said anything regarding the pregnancy. 

A few weeks ago my husband was getting his haircut and his mom walks in to get her haircut after him. They discussed Christmas Eve dinner and what she was going to serve. She mentioned ham and my husband told her i am not eating ham since I’m pregnant and shouldn’t eat it. He also told her i stopped drinking coffee since becoming pregnant. Her response is “Really?!…. She would never survive back in my day.” She said it in a rude tone and had nothing else to say. 
My husband came home and told me what happened. I did correct him on the ham situation letting him know i just don’t eat cold cut deli meats but i will eat a fully cooked ham. I then reached out to my mil to let her know i will eat the ham and informed her of the risk of listeria while pregnant. 

A few days after Christmas, my husband and i were hanging out with his sisters. I asked them if mil is excited for the grand baby. Right away they looked down and could hardly say yes shes excited. Then the oldest sister gets defensive of mil making excuses for her before my husband and i could say anything. His sister said this is all just a lot for mil and it’s her first time living life, she just needs baby steps. 
I felt weird from that conversation. I was genuinely curious if my mil was excited but judging by her daughter’s immediate defensiveness I’m guessing shes not excited. Her daughters are still under my mil grip, to the point my husband cant make jokes about my mil to them. 

Shortly after Christmas i reached out to my Mil informing her of the date we picked out for the baby shower and letting her know we will inform her of any updates on the baby shower. I never received a response or any type of acknowledgment that she saw the text. Even after all the drama from the wedding she caused i was trying to make her feel included with the baby shower considering this is her first grandchild.

Fast forward i am now 25 weeks pregnant. My mil and my husband’s entire side of the family has not once reached out to either me or my husband regarding anything to do with my pregnancy or the baby. 
My family is always reaching out to see how everyone is doing, my mom and sister are making us baby blankets and wash cloths. Also my mom is planning the baby shower now. 

My mom reached out to my mil regarding the baby shower, to see if she wanted to help plan it. Surprisingly my mil wanted to join my mom and help plan it. My parents booked a venue that can host both sides of our family for the couples baby shower. 
Of course my mil had to make the comment to my mom on the phone “my family probably wont come cause they live in (next state next to us), so we will have to do something separate there with them.” . Which is 45 minute drive for her family and we are always driving there for every holiday and event they host but for some reason they cant come here. 
My mil made the same comment about her family not coming to my couples shower for the wedding.

Im not sure why it’s always an issue with her when my husband and i have parties with both of our families together. How she “forgot” to invite my family to the engagement party and blamed me, how she told me her family wont come to the wedding couples shower and tried to plan her own party in the next state over i would have to travel to, and now this with the baby shower which shes only mentioned the second shower to my mom and no one else. 

I wish i knew what goes through my mil head. 
We shall see how this all continues to go…",18,1739371623.0,JUSTNOMIL,12,1.0,False

I’ll be serving a single product, similar to a small pie. I aim at it being aspirational and exotic but still familiar to the American public. 

There will be multiple variations: so far, I’ve only made sweet versions, but I plan to introduce a couple of savory options as well. The product is made from two core preparations, both of which can be frozen to minimize waste. Once cooked, it lasts 2 days outside the fridge and 5 days in.

The plan is to serve these with paired wines or coffee, and I’ll also offer a small selection of Italian products for takeout—wines, pasta, cookies, etc. In addition to the bar, I aim to provide catering for both companies and private customers (think team breakfasts, parties, weddings).

A bit about me: I’m an Operations Exec by day, but my true passion is baking. I’ve been selling my desserts on a small scale and the reception has been enthusiastic. I’ve also taken lessons from one well known pastry chef to refine my skills. While I’m used to managing teams and complex projects, I don’t have direct experience in the food sector.

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s made a similar life change or has experience running a food business. Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated!",1,1739371533.0,Business_Ideas,0,1.0,False

I recently joined a programme related to my profession being held in an institute far from my hometown for 2-3months.
After joining the course for a month I was super focused and hardly talked to anybody here. By the start of the second month, everything was monotonous but then as life would've had it I stumbled upon HER.

I met her for the first time while I was mindlessly walking in the corridor with my airpods on and turned around abruptly only to be faced by her. We only shared a smile that day but I knew that she had put an ache in me that played in my head like the symphony of the best song I’ve ever heard.

As the days passed subsequently I started being more observant of her, I suddenly felt more conscious of her presence. 
We shared uncanny eye contacts whenever we crossed paths and the more I saw her around the more I found myself being drawn to her. 

We were CODED straight out of movies.
There were days where we would unknowingly match outfits (one day I was wearing a baby blue hoodie while she was wearing a baby blue sweater, once I wore a pink shirt while she looked flawless in a pink sweatshirt, we even managed to match the same shade of green) 

It was straight up DESTINY
We unknowingly bumped into each other a lot. If I opened a door she was on the other side pulling it, if i was sitting in a particular seat she was across me, even our breakfast time was synced, we even got the same coffee at the same time. 
Maybe it was beacuse that I was now more aware, but I was falling hard, I developed a major crush on her.
I fell for her like i discovered my favourite song, she was smart beautiful, reserved and had a mysterious aura around her.
But I had a major issue:
Never in my life had I actively approached another human being, let alone a crush (awkward introvert with some anxiety issues)

Finally after weeks of this torture I tired to pull myself from the depths of misery as it was taking a toll on my studies and mental health. I talked to my friends and they suggested that i should muster up courage and talk to her, to atleast try to be friends. 

So after practising in front of the mirror for a few days I managed to approach her (ironically on that day too we we matching the same shade of blue), can't share the details as my hands were literally shaking 
I came up with the most unoriginal phrase ""have we met before"" and as expected got a straight up rejection in the form of ""ive never seen you"", BUT we managed to exchange names. I was shattered but my chest felt lighter. 

That day I decided to give up on this whole charade as she was obviously not interested. One of my friends suggested that im just complicating it with bringing in 'my feelings' which is making me more nervous and ruining the possibility of even having a friendship with her (it hit right in the feels)

So I decided that day ""friends it is"" 

So for the next few days I minded my own business and whenever i came across her i just politely smiled which she actively reciprocated. 
I was getting over this situation and we naturally fell in a pattern of politely acknowledging each other.

Until one day when she actively decided to avoid me, first I didn't think much of it but as the day progressed it became very obvious. Suddenly I was feeling hurt and rejected. But it wasnt my place to feel so as we DIDNT even know each other. The same day during lunch as destiny would have it we were again stuck together waiting for the food to be served and as expected she was still acting like I was invisible to her. 
So we just stood there awkwardly. It was very suffocating, so i tried to call it a truce by helping her with the cutlery and napkins. She took them and thanked me. So i politely smiled and went to grab a seat with my friend. I WOULD HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD happen but she too grabbed a seat with us. She intiated a conversation with me and damn it just flowed.
Within a snap of seconds we were laughing and teasing each other.
She was saying all the right things, we had similar interests, similar bucket lists, similar tastes, plans for future, the list is endless. We talked for half an hour Im pretty sure my friend felt like a third wheel. 
But damn we really were coded, i was right. We ended on ""I'll see you around"" and that day I knew for sure  that we will make great friends.

But as destiny would have it, the saga countinues the following days we were back to being hot and cold with each other and it HURT. We weren't talking and actively ignoring each other and i didn't know why. 

So again i tried to call it a truce by approaching her myself. And boy that went great, we again talked a lot about anything and everything, personal stuff , family related, anecdotes about college... this happened a few more times in the following week. At times she would approach me too and again this became our new pattern. 
But most of the time we acted indifferent towards each other and that was just plain awkward (maybe beacuse we both are introverts) 

So we both just felt into this rhythm and I minded my own business being satisfied of our ""situation"". We both got to know a lot about each other (in our scarce meetings) even intimate stuff and I now knew for sure that I had to have a friendship with her.

But eventually the programme that we both were enrolled for was coming to an end. My friends had strictly told me to get her socials or contact number on the last day. 

So today was the last day. I had practised for asking her socials (not her number-too intimate). 
We came across each other only ONCE today (Destiny has left the chat), during which we only waved and smiled. 
She was with her friend while i was with mine, i definitely couldn't approach her with my anxiety being all time high. 
So i planned on approaching her after the closing ceremony. But as fate would have it she left early, it was like a punch in the gut. 
Now im sitting here thinking about
The aftermath of us ? 
2 strangers with their lives painted across the cold of this weather 
Transitioning into anonymity of spring

I've looked her up she has no socials, i was fighting a battle i was destined to lose. I dont know what to do ... there's slight a possibility of meeting her again after 10-11 days when we are supposed to collect our documents but I dont know 
What if she doesn't come ? 
What will i say if she does ? 
What if i chicken out again ? 
These 10 days will just make me more anxious nd sad

It's watered down, weak and has an off putting taste. I have it set to max strength, grind setting is 3, and reset it back to the factory volume setting. 

Question: Has anyone had any luck making a good cup of coffee with this machine, or am I expecting it to do something that its not designed to do? Do I need to be using a different grind setting for coffee and espresso? It says it takes 2-3 cups for the grind setting to actually set in, so changing back and forth is very inconvenient. 

PS - I read through a bunch of other Magnifica start posts and couldnt find an answer. Feel free to point me in the right direction if this has been discussed. Thanks!",1,1739371219.0,superautomatic,1,0.67,False

I have been reading a lot of books where the fmcs have these illustrious careers that they are super passionate about, which makes sense because their careers are often important for the plot but right now I kind of just want a little more realistic where the FMC has a job that doesn't really define who they are, does that make sense? thank u in advance!",25,1739371153.0,RomanceBooks,68,1.0,False
1ins9xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheatedOn/comments/1ins9xx/almost_125_years_married/,"Almost 12,5 years married","So I (44 now) married in 2013 with my now ex-wife (36 now). We got our first son in 2014 and the second one in 2017. Our first child has autism and can't really communicate normally  just short sentences and has some trouble with tensions and busy places. Our second son has Developmental Language Disorder or DLD and some signs of autism. All went well up to 2020 when I found out she was mailing some old friend she used to have a sex relation with before I met her but with another boyfriend she was with back in the day. I saw a webpage open on her phone on a newly made mail account where she was making contact to meet up and chat about old times. I confronted her with that the next day and we got into an argument but during that week she got so stressed out because I told her I would bring this to her parents that she called in sick and went into a burnout. It went so bad she started pulling hairs out, living with her parents for nearly 8 months and always verbally calling me names simply because I notified her parents. Fast forward those 8 months and I noticed a change about her, she seemed more normal again but she had his number in her phone and apparently met up with him which I found out. She and even he claimed nothing happened just a kiss and she was dead set on getting better and working on our relationship. Suffice to say I was heartbroken that she actually managed to meet him somewhere and who knows what happened, so since September 2021 we where working on our marriage again and for almost 2,5 years it went better. Our kids flourished and made big leaps in development and life seemed better. I was just finishing up therapy for the cheating part, when she announced she wanted to invite the swim teacher for a cup of coffee and just chat with him. I asked her why would you do that, he was a creepy man aged 60 that kept stroking our oldest on his head when I told him he doesn't like to be touched on the head by anyone. He got a little offended by that but maybe I am too protective of our son. She eventually said nah not gonna ask him for coffee it might come across as weird to do that she agreed. 

We kept swimming there for a month or 2 when she asked him if we could get extra swimming lessons for our children outside of the regular hours. I found it weird and it made me a bit uncomfortable because the youngest wasn't all the fond of him, but gave her her way with it. Short to say it was an utter disaster, the youngest didn't want to have him around him and he swam a whole 5 minutes with our oldest son for 60 euro's which i found money thrown away. After the whole 5 minutes swimming we talked a bit the 3 of us while keeping our children under supervision from the water slide and out of nowhere she touched him and stroked him across his arms. When he left I was a little pissed by that and told her why would you do that and she replied why not I do that with you also. To which I said obviously seeing I am your husband and he isn't even a friend. Weeks went by and swimming lessons where plain waste of time, youngest didn't want to swim anymore and the oldest just played in the water and didn't wanna listen so he suggested family swimming where we could join as well. Figured sure we can do that and see how it goed and he made a comment he wanted to see me in a bathing suit and my wife in a swimming pants, which I told him I found that a rather unprofessional remark. He laughed it away but it nagged on me, so 2 weeks later the family swimming was there and my wife had a bruised toe so she didn't join in the water and when I got in with the kids he said BRB gonna take a bathroom break and when he came back he joined my wife inside the break room and wasn't even in the water at all for the appointed 45 mins. I decided then and there I was done with the swimming lessons and filed a complaint about the remark and him leaving us unsupervised. 

Told my wife I was gonna make a complaint and she said yes do that she didn't like how he left us. Figured nice, she understands but apparently she called him the next day and told him about it and made up a story I threatened her with the complaint. Sadly the complaint never got taken upon because she refused to talk to the committee who was handling it and it made me look like a fool. I noticed she called him at her work several times in september and october and figured this is crossing boundaries so had a talk with her parents and her mother was quite upset mostly because she made things up about me and was trying to meet up with a man 24 years older then her. She told she didn't know why she did it and said I won't do it anymore. She was becoming increasingly different and went several times completely off grid and totally not reachable. I figured this is taking a toll on me and was more cautious and also alot more suspicious about what she was up. In January this year I was done at work at 12.00 instead of 16.00 so she wanted to meet for lunch and I figured fine, didn't tell her I was done for the day. We met up had lunch and she said she was gonna run some errands and go to the sun studio. Figured ok, I am gonna see if she really goes where she says she goes. So stayed around the parking lot she parked and indeed she went to the sun studio but right after she entered I saw the swim teacher also going inside and found this really suspicious. 45 min later both came out and where chatting and laughing and went to have something to eat together. Felt like a fool at that moment but figured gonna confront her and see if her phone recorded something they talked about (I enabled the voice recorder when we had lunch but she left her phone in the car. That evening I figured let's see if they met up in the sun studio and yes they where talking together and went into the same sun booth. 5 mins later you heard them having sex and that was when I decided enough. I confronted her the next day and went to her parents to tell them I am sorry but I am getting divorced from your daughter. We went to mediation, set everything up but the children will be staying with me in the house and she would move out nearby to an apartment but sadly no luck getting something for her so she opted a hotel 5 minutes away. That evening she called a little emotional how sorry she was and everything and seeing a friend was over he watched the kids who where sleeping already and I figured let's go to her and see if she is okay. Sure she was okay she invited her swim teacher over who came with flowers and a suitcase and they spent 2 nights there and now she is moved in with him and lives there 2 weeks now this day.

It's been an emotional Rollercoaster and I feel a fool, not for having my 2 sons 24/7, that never but she can fuck around and go on dates with him and vacation which she is going early March but how can a mother throw everything out the window for a man 24 years older she apparently been sleeping with since September I now know off. Been played and strung along for months and she can't understand I am not in the mood to have small talk when she comes over to see the kids and help bring them to bed. She believes she didn't do anything wrong and I am overreacting. Children won't move from me to her mostly because of the oldest autism and he needs a place he knows and feels safe at and honestly I don't want to have that old creep near my children at all. She set up rules no new partner would see the children or come with them on an outing, afterwards I confined myself quite heavily because if I meet someone in the future a relationship will be quite a challenge.

1ins8o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1ins8o4/roommate_wanted_part_14/,Roommate wanted. Part 14,"Tim sat on the couch, his body still aching from the day’s events. His mind was a whirlwind of emotions—humiliation, exhaustion, and a lingering sense of dread. He had just started to relax when his phone buzzed on the coffee table. He picked it up and saw Nuria’s name on the screen. His heart sank, but he knew better than to ignore her call.

“Hello?” he said, his voice hesitant.

“Timmy,” Nuria’s voice came through the phone, sharp and commanding. “Axl and I aren’t coming home tonight. We decided to take a little road trip, and we’re already too far to turn back.”

Tim’s eyes widened in panic. “What? But… Miss Nuria, I have to work tomorrow. I need my car to—”

Nuria cut him off with a sharp laugh. “Oh, don’t be so dramatic, Timmy. You can take the bus like you usually do. But there’s something else you need to take care of.”

Tim’s stomach churned. “What is it?”

Nuria’s tone turned serious. “Axl’s brother needs his Jeep back. You’re going to drive it over to him tonight. And you’re going to be *very* careful with it. I’ll send you the address in a bit.”

Tim’s mind raced. “But… Miss Nuria, what do I say to his brother? How do I explain why I’m the one driving his car?”

Nuria laughed, a light, airy sound that sent a chill down Tim’s spine. “Oh, Timmy, just tell him the truth. Say that Axl wanted to make sure his car was cleaned, and you volunteered to do it. Simple, right?”

Tim hesitated, but before he could respond, Nuria’s tone shifted, and he could hear the excitement in her voice. “Wait, I have a better idea. This is going to be *fun*.”

Tim’s heart sank. He knew that tone. It was the tone she used when she had some new way to humiliate or control him.

“Here’s what you’re going to do,” Nuria continued, her voice bubbling with excitement. “When you get there, you’re going to tell Axl’s brother that you’re like… a genie. You’re going to say, ‘Sir, I’m like a genie out of a bottle, and you have three wishes. Anything is possible.’”

Tim’s eyes widened in disbelief. “What? Miss Nuria, I can’t—”

Nuria cut him off, her voice sharp. “Oh, yes, you can. And you will. After each wish, you’re going to say, ‘You have X wishes remaining, sir. Anything is possible.’ Got it?”

Tim swallowed hard, his mind racing. “But… Miss Nuria, I have to work tomorrow. How am I supposed to get back home after I drop off the car?”

Nuria laughed, a cold, mocking sound. “Oh, Timmy, don’t ruin the fun. You’re going to stay there until all three wishes are fulfilled. And you’re going to make it clear that you’ll stay as long as he wants. Understood?”

Tim’s heart pounded in his chest. “Miss Nuria, I… I can’t do that. It’s too much.”

Nuria’s tone turned icy. “Timmy, you just earned yourself five lashes for talking back. Now, are you going to follow my instructions, or do I need to remind you of your place?”

Tim’s stomach churned, but he knew better than to argue. “I… I’ll do it, Miss Nuria,” he said quietly. “I’ll go to his brother’s house and say everything you told me.”

Nuria’s smile was audible through the phone. “Good boy. I’ll send you the address. And remember, Timmy—anything is possible.”

Tim hesitated, his mind racing with questions. “But… Miss Nuria, what if his brother doesn’t believe me? What if he thinks I’m crazy?”

Nuria laughed, a light, airy sound that made Tim’s skin crawl. “Oh, Timmy, that’s the best part. He’s going to think you’re completely insane. And you’re going to play along because I said so. Got it?”

Tim nodded weakly, even though she couldn’t see him. “Yes, Miss Nuria.”

“And one more thing,” Nuria added, her tone sharp. “You’re going to call him ‘sir’ every time you speak to him. Every. Single. Time. Understood?”

Tim swallowed hard. “Yes, Miss Nuria.”

“Good,” Nuria said, her voice dripping with satisfaction. “Now, get moving. I’ll send you the address in a few minutes. And remember, Timmy—anything is possible.”

The line went dead, and Tim sat there, staring at his phone, his mind racing. *How did I end up like this?* he thought. *Why can’t I just walk away?*

As Nuria hung up the phone, a satisfied smile spread across her face. She leaned back in the passenger seat of Tim’s car, her mind racing with excitement. *This is going to be perfect,* she thought. *Timmy’s going to be so humiliated, and there’s nothing he can do about it.*

She glanced over at Axl, who was driving with a wide grin on his face. “You’re going to love this,” she said, her tone playful. “Timmy’s going to tell your brother that he’s a genie. Can you imagine the look on his face?”

Axl laughed, clearly enjoying the idea. “This is going to be great. My brother’s going to think he’s lost his mind.”

Nuria’s smile widened. *Exactly,* she thought. *And the best part is, Timmy’s going to do it because he has no choice. He’s completely under my control.*

As Tim sat on the couch, staring at his phone, his mind was a whirlwind of emotions. The humiliation, the exhaustion, the fear—it all swirled together into a heavy, suffocating weight.

 

Tim arrived at the address Nuria had sent him, his heart pounding in his chest. He parked Axl’s brother’s Jeep in the driveway and took a deep breath, trying to steady his nerves. *This is insane,* he thought. *How am I supposed to do this?* But he knew he didn’t have a choice. Nuria’s words echoed in his mind: *Anything is possible.*

He walked up to the front door and rang the bell, his hands trembling slightly. After a moment, the door opened, revealing a man in his mid-thirties with a puzzled expression on his face. He looked Tim up and down, clearly confused.

“Can I help you?” the man asked, his tone cautious.

Tim swallowed hard and forced a smile. “Hi, uh… my name’s Tim. I’m a friend of Axl’s. I’m here to return your Jeep.”

The man’s eyes narrowed. “Axl’s friend? Why are *you* bringing it back? Where’s Axl?”

Tim hesitated, his mind racing. “Uh… Axl’s, uh… busy. He asked me to bring it back for him. And, uh… I cleaned it for you too.”

The man—Mason, as Tim would soon learn—stepped outside and looked at the Jeep. His eyes widened slightly as he took in the gleaming exterior, the spotless windows, and the freshly vacuumed interior. “Wow,” he said, his tone shifting from suspicion to mild appreciation. “You did this?”

Tim nodded, his face burning with a mix of pride and embarrassment. “Yeah. I, uh… wanted to make sure it looked good for you.”

Mason crossed his arms, still eyeing Tim with a mix of curiosity and skepticism. “Alright, Tim. Thanks for bringing it back. But why are you still here? You could’ve just left it in the driveway.”

Tim’s heart sank. This was the moment he’d been dreading. He took a deep breath and forced himself to say the words Nuria had demanded. “Well, uh… there’s something else. I’m, uh… kind of like a… a wish genie. For you. Tonight. You get three wishes, and I’ll make them happen. Anything is possible.”

Mason stared at him, his expression a mix of shock and disbelief. For a long moment, he didn’t say anything. Then he burst out laughing. “A wish genie? Are you serious?”

Tim nodded, his face burning with humiliation. “Yes, sir. Anything is possible.”

Mason’s laughter died down, and he studied Tim with a curious expression. “Alright, let’s say I believe you. What’s the catch?”

Tim shook his head. “No catch, sir. You get three wishes. I’ll do whatever you ask.”

Mason raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. “Anything, huh? Alright, let’s test this out. I’ve got a pile of laundry that needs to be done. Wash, dry, fold—the whole deal. And while you’re waiting on the machine, you can iron the stuff that’s already clean. That’s my first wish.”

Tim’s heart sank. He had hoped Mason would ask for something simple, like a cup of coffee or a sandwich. But no, of course it had to be laundry. *Of course,* he thought bitterly. *Why would anything be easy?*

“Uh… okay,” Tim said, forcing a smile. “I’ll get started right away, sir.”

Mason smirked, clearly enjoying himself. “Good. And just so you know, I expect *excellent* results. No half-assed folding or wrinkled shirts. Got it?”

Tim nodded, his face burning. “Yes, sir. I’ll do my best.”

Mason led Tim to the laundry room, where a mountain of clothes awaited. Tim’s heart sank as he took in the sheer volume of work. *This is going to take forever,* he thought. But he didn’t have a choice. He rolled up his sleeves and got to work.

He started by sorting the clothes into piles—whites, colors, delicates. Then he loaded the washing machine and set it to the appropriate cycle. While the machine churned away, he turned his attention to the ironing board, where a stack of freshly washed but wrinkled clothes sat waiting.

Tim had never been particularly good at ironing, but he did his best, carefully smoothing out each shirt and pair of pants. His hands trembled slightly as he worked, his mind racing with thoughts of Nuria and what she would do if he messed this up. *She’ll probably give me another five lashes,* he thought bitterly. *Or worse.*

By the time the washing machine finished its cycle, Tim had managed to iron most of the clothes. He transferred the wet laundry to the dryer and started folding the freshly ironed items, stacking them neatly on the table. His back ached, and his hands were sore, but he didn’t stop. He couldn’t.

When the dryer finally beeped, signaling the end of its cycle, Tim quickly folded the warm clothes and added them to the pile. He stepped back to admire his work, a small sense of pride creeping in despite the humiliation of the situation. *At least it looks good,* he thought. *Mason can’t complain about this.*

Tim carried the neatly folded clothes back to the living room, where Mason was sitting on the couch, watching TV. He set the pile down on the coffee table and cleared his throat.

“Uh… Mason,” he began, his voice hesitant. “Your laundry’s done. I, uh… folded everything. And ironed the stuff that was already clean.”

Mason looked up, his expression one of mild surprise. He picked up a shirt from the pile and inspected it, running his hand over the smooth fabric. “Huh,” he said, his tone impressed. “Not bad, Tim. Not bad at all.”

Tim nodded, his face burning. “Thank you, sir. You, uh… you have two wishes left. And… uh… anything is possible.”

Mason smirked, clearly enjoying himself. “Alright, wish genie. Let’s see what you’ve got.”

Tim stood awkwardly in Mason’s living room, his hands clasped in front of him, waiting for Mason to announce his second wish. The first one had been bad enough—hours of laundry and ironing—but Tim had a sinking feeling that the second wish would be even worse. He glanced at Mason, who was lounging on the couch with a smug expression on his face, clearly enjoying the power he had over Tim.

“So,” Mason began, his tone casual but with a hint of mischief, “for my second wish… can it be something financial? Like, can you make me rich or pay off my debts or something?”

Tim’s eyes widened in panic. “Uh… I… I don’t think that’s part of the deal,” he stammered, his voice trembling. “I mean, I’m just supposed to… to do things for you. Not… not pay for stuff.”

Mason waved a hand dismissively, clearly not listening. “Nah, nah, I’m sure it’s fine. Let’s see…” He leaned back, tapping his chin thoughtfully. “Oh, I’ve got it. My Jeep. It’s not fully paid off yet. And since you did such a great job cleaning it earlier, how about you take care of the rest of the payments? That’s my second wish.”

Tim’s heart sank. “What? No, I… I can’t do that.”

Mason cut him off with a sharp look. “Wish genie,” he said, his tone firm, “my second wish is that you pay off my Jeep in full. No excuses.”

Tim stared at him, his mind racing. *This can’t be happening,* he thought. *Why am I supposed to pay off his car?* But before he could protest further, Mason stood up and walked over to a desk in the corner of the room. He opened a laptop and navigated to the website of his car dealership.

“Here,” Mason said, turning the screen toward Tim. “See? I’ve only paid off three months of a 36-month contract. There’s still a lot left to go. But since you’re my wish genie, you’re going to take care of that for me. Right?”

Tim’s stomach churned as he looked at the numbers on the screen. The remaining balance was staggering—far more than he could afford. He swallowed hard, his hands trembling. “Mason, I… I can’t do this. This isn’t… this isn’t what I agreed to.”

Mason’s expression darkened, and he crossed his arms over his chest. “Oh, really? So you’re saying you’re not going to fulfill my wish? That’s not how this works, is it? I thought *anything* was possible.”

Tim’s face burned with humiliation. “I… I mean, it’s just… this is too much. I can’t—”

Mason cut him off again, his tone sharp. “You know what? If you’re not going to do it, I’ll just call Axl and let him know his so-called ‘wish genie’ isn’t living up to expectations. How do you think he’ll react to that?”

Tim’s heart raced. The thought of Nuria finding out he hadn’t followed through on Mason’s wish was enough to make his blood run cold. He couldn’t risk it. He couldn’t risk her anger, her punishment. He had no choice.

“No!” Tim said quickly, his voice desperate. “No, don’t call Axl. I… I’ll do it. Your wish is my command, sir. I’ll… I’ll pay it off.”

Mason smirked, clearly enjoying Tim’s discomfort. “Good. I knew you’d see it my way.”

Tim pulled out his wallet with trembling hands and took out his bank card. He stared at it for a moment, his mind racing. *This is insane,* he thought. *I’m about to wipe out my savings because of some stupid game Nuria forced me into.* But he didn’t have a choice. He couldn’t risk Nuria’s wrath.

He entered his card details into the payment portal, his hands shaking so badly he could barely type. When he finally clicked the “Submit” button, he felt a wave of nausea wash over him. The confirmation screen popped up, and Mason let out a low whistle.

“Well, look at that,” Mason said, his tone mocking. “My Jeep is officially paid off. Thanks, wish genie. You’re not so bad after all.”

Tim forced a weak smile, his stomach churning. “You’re welcome, sir. You, uh… you have one wish left. And… anything is possible.”

Mason leaned back on the couch, a satisfied smile on his face. “Good to know. I’ll have to think carefully about that last one. Wouldn’t want to waste it, would I?”

Tim nodded weakly, his mind still reeling from what he’d just done. *How am I going to explain this to Nuria?* he thought. *She’s going to kill me.* But deep down, he knew there was no way out. He was trapped, caught in a web of humiliation and control, and there was no escape.

As Tim stood there, looking pale and shaken, Mason couldn’t help but feel a sense of satisfaction. *This is amazing,* he thought, a small smile playing on his lips. *I’ve got my own personal servant, and he’s actually paying off my car. This is the best day ever.*

He glanced at Tim, who was still staring at the laptop screen with a look of utter despair. *Poor guy,* Mason thought, though he didn’t feel particularly sorry for him. *He’s clearly in way over his head. But hey, that’s not my problem. If he’s dumb enough to go along with this, that’s on him.*

Mason leaned back on the couch, his mind already racing with ideas for his third wish. *What should I ask for next?* he wondered. *A vacation? A new TV? The possibilities are endless.*

As Tim stood there, his mind was a whirlwind of emotions. The humiliation, the fear, the sheer absurdity of the situation—it all swirled together into a heavy, suffocating weight.

*How did I end up like this?* he thought, his hands trembling as he clutched his bank card. *Why can’t I just walk away?*

Tim stood in Mason’s living room, his heart pounding in his chest. He wanted nothing more than to leave, to get out of this nightmare and go home. But he knew he couldn’t. Not until Mason’s third wish was fulfilled. He forced himself to speak the words Nuria had drilled into him, his voice trembling.

“You… you have one wish left, sir,” Tim said, his eyes fixed on the floor. “And… anything is possible.”

Mason raised an eyebrow, a sly smile spreading across his face. “Anything is possible, huh? You keep saying that. It’s like you *want* me to wish for something special.”

Tim’s face burned with humiliation. “I… I have to say it, sir. It’s part of the… the deal.”

Mason laughed, a low, mocking sound. “Oh, I see. You *have* to say it. That’s the difference.” As he spoke, his hand drifted to his lap, and he began rubbing himself over his pants. Tim’s eyes flicked to Mason’s hand, and his stomach churned. He felt a wave of panic wash over him, but he didn’t dare move.

Mason’s smile widened as he noticed Tim’s discomfort. “Everything is possible… hmm…” he said, his voice low and teasing. His hand moved faster, more deliberately, and Tim could see the growing bulge in Mason’s pants. “Maybe I’ve got something here that you can help me with, little wish genie.”",2,1739371028.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

Currently living overseas and there’s a Brazilian lady at work I happen to be smitten with. Asked her to go out on a date last weekend, which went well I’d say. Good conversation no awkwardness and really engaging interaction throughout the night. Dropped her off home and gave her a hug goodnight. 

Fast forward to yesterday, asked her to grab a coffee after class, to which she said yes. Ended up walking to a nearby shop and talked for 3 hours over some orange juice. We spoke about Brazilian culture and she explained the “ficante” concept to me and the how different it is from the American culture of dating. She said said that it was strange for her to go out to dinner with me as a first date but she knew it was normal to me as an American. Fast forward, I asked her “are we gonna do this the Brazilian way or the American way” and of course, she said the Brazilian way haha. 
We left shortly after and I walked her home. Once we got to her building, she gave me a hug, to which I said something like “I thought we were doing this the Brazilian way” and she said how kissing goodbye at her door outside is too American and something out of a movie and she’d want to be in a more comfortable place. I said okay i understand and gave her a hug goodnight. Once I got home, for some reason, I had the feeling that the last interaction might’ve made her uncomfortable so I called her and asked and she said no not at all etc. I then asked, “ So no more dinner dates” she said “Yeah no, that’s moving too fast” to which I replied “We can go get açaí then sometime”. She said sure and the conversation ended there.

Honestly, kind of confused with the whole cultural thing and how it works in Brazil. I’d say she likes me from the conversations we have and her always looking to go out etc however from what I’ve read, in Brazilian culture, a kiss would’ve happened by now.

I met her through my mother, and she has been a combination mentor/third parent who has helped me through some really tough times when my parents weren't able to on their own. In the past year or so I have realised that I have romantic feelings for her, which I am seriously confused about. I know what I want; I know I can't have it. The big challenge here is that I have autism (what used to be known as Asperger's and more latterly high-functioning autism) and understanding and managing emotions and responding appropriately to them just does not come naturally at all. After a lot of work with professionals, I am able to process less complex thoughts and feelings with some confidence, but this is well beyond anything I've been able to tackle thus far. My normal choices would be either A) to just say it outright or B) bottle it up and hope like hell it just goes away. I strongly believe that neither of those options is appropriate in this situation (bottling things up has caused me real problems in the past). I feel sure that there is a way I can deal with this, I just have zero idea what it is.

We don't meet up very often at all, but I've become acutely aware that these feelings are beginning to affect my mental health. I am noticing thoughts about it are lingering in my mind, and this is increasingly worrying me. She is in a committed, long-term relationship that I have no interest in or intention of stepping into the middle of with unwanted, unsolicited advances. I am not looking to try and make something happen which I know simply won't; I am wanting to continue to enjoy knowing her and meeting for the occasional coffee as has been the case for a number of years now, and that is all.

I'm confident this won't be impossible for me, but right now my parents are not currently in a position to really offer me any assistance as they are both busy dealing with their own lives. Waiting for them to be more able to help isn't really an option, as I have recently conquered some mental health challenges, and I really don't want to threaten ruining all my progress to date by letting this fester and become something completely disproportionate to what it really is. As a chronic overthinker, the chance of that happening is pretty high IMO. There are pros who can help me out, but they all have longish waitlists (I've contacted a few), and I'm not in a financial position to go to a private provider.

What strategies are there that I can learn about and implement which may be able to help lessen these feelings?

I'm an African American and decided that I wanted to live in Africa. Long story short, I'm in Ethiopia now and the people in Mekele are great. Every time I walk into the street I'm greeted by strangers and they offer me food.  But because of policies living here wouldn't be easy. The cost is good im paying for a small room , 40 dollars a month. Nothing special about it, 3x4 shared bathroom. It's gated, with other families who are great. 

But the visia is too high and to start a business the government told me I will need to deposit 200,000 USD for a investment license lol. 

So I was wondering if I can get similar prices in Kenya. I am blessed to look like most east Africans. People stop to talk to me in the local language all the time. And when I ask people to guess my nationality they usually say Kenyan.

So I wanted to know what is a good price for a basic room. I'm thinking ok focusing on writing so don't need much other than a good coffee shop nearby. And Kenya have a 5 year visa program where I will have to leave every 3 months that works for now for me. So right now I'm trying to create a budget.

I currently do not have insurance for a dermatologist as of the moment, so advice & tips would be so great fully appreciated! 

To start off, some relevant (maybe irrelevant but I’m detailed oriented) factors: I am [26M], oily/combo skin type since puberty. I live in northern Utah, (Known as “high desert climate”) Elevation- 4,810ft. It’s been a pretty cold winter as of recently, I experience occasional dryness on cheeks/in or around my facial hair, & frequent chapped lips. I do have raynauds syndrome (link to those who don’t know what it is) https://www.reddit.com/r/Raynauds/ 
I’m on top of my water intake, typically close to a gallon a day 5/7 days of the week. I eat fresh or frozen vegetables with dinner and sometimes lunch almost every day. I eat lots of fruit, I do consume a lot of diary such as a morning yogurt each morning, ice cream for dessert, and lots of cheese! I do however eat processed food more than I should. I drink coffee daily, and Diet Coke regularly. I drink alcohol about 3 times a week, usually consisting on beers, seltzers, or Sailor Jerry’s Diet Cokes! I am recently in recovery due to cocaine addiction (definitely has damaged my skin!) I am a daily user of nicotine (vape/occasional cigarette)
I use unscented laundry detergent and softener, I wear a hair system most of the time, and I sleep in a protective bonnet so the oils I use don’t touch my skin, and when I’m at home doing nothing I’ll wear a sweatband to keep my hair out my eyes, and when I’m not wearing my toupee I wear beanies or a cap. 
I live with a chihuahua/wiener dog mix, and a short haired cat. (Long haired cats and short haired dogs tend to give me allergies more than these cuties) 
We vacuum and dust regularly, however our house is very close to a lot of commercial and residential development being built causing lots of stir up of dirt, and our street borders a huge empty field, so it’s always dusty here. 
I should mention my dad has had several surgery’s for his basal cell carcinomas, due to constantly being in the sun. 6 years prior to now I had a very short period in life involving using tanning beds a couple times a week for almost a year. (Noticeable damage already) 

I definitely know I should change my diet and lifestyle a bit and stop my bad habits, and environmental factors and the pollution in Salt Lake City are terrible, but my skin has almost gotten worse in the last year (probably due to my addiction and not enough hydration and nutrition) than it did in high school. I did have pretty typical teenage acne in high school (cheeks and temples, occasional breakouts around mouth) to which I used GOLD BAR DIAL SOAP on my face, with switching up  moisturizer frequently, never really paying attention. My main concerns are the pores, my texture, redness, and dark circles. 

Daily: Cleanse with CeraVe foaming facial cleanser, tone with Thayers unscented witch hazel (once a night), and I go between either The Ordinary Niacinamide 10%+Zinc 1%, or the MAC Hyper Real serumizer (mainly niacinamide). I then moisturize with the CeraVe daily moisture lotion, and mornings only for SPF, I use the Beauty of Joseon relief sun: rice and probiotics SPF 50+

3x a week: liquid exfoliate with Paula’s Choice 2% BHA nightly (just started using again this last week after a 2 month break) 

That’s my skincare routine^^^^^^

Occasionally: Mud masks, under eye gel patches, and sometimes tanning facial drops when I have a self tan. 

Any advice would be appreciated, sorry if it’s too detailed but I find those details to be important possible reasons. Recommended products, diy products, recommendations for cleaning, diet, etc. Proven effects and damage caused from what I’ve chosen to put into my body, anything! Thank you.

EDIT- I found the skin cancer accurate to add because of the risk and my family history of how common it is, even though every family member who’s had it was raised in either Southern California or Florida (doesn’t matter but we don’t nearly get that kind of sun)",1,1739370764.0,SkincareAddicts,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

At first, as a little kid, I thought it was fantastic. No more nightmares, unlimited chips my mom wouldn’t have let me eat, and the ability to haunt the dreams of the bully I couldn’t stand up to. But now? I feel nothing. Like an artist who turned their hobby into a job: faded, indifferent, forced to repeat the same thing over and over. But it pays the bills, and unlike those self-proclaimed ""dream interpreters,"" at least I actually help people.

They call my kind ""Dream Walkers.""

I made my morning coffee, took out my journal, sat in my office, and started waiting for my clients, sorry, my *patients*.

A woman kept dreaming that her husband was cheating on her. No problem. The moment I swapped the other woman’s face with the client’s own, the issue was solved. She even left a tip.

*There he goes, there he goes, the little boy, there he goes…\~*  
Another withering flower lulled into peace with a lullaby. Should I thank the people who started this war or curse them? Can’t decide. They’ve certainly filled my pockets and funded my vacation in Italy, but these veterans’ dreams? Absolute nightmares. Poor guy kept reliving his comrade dying in his arms every single night. I pulled him from the muddy trenches and placed him in a countryside house surrounded by wildflowers. Told him the war was over. Then I called my assistant, asked for some space, and stared at the wall for a long, long time.

I didn’t acquire this ability by choice, but I sure knew how to make money from it.

My assistant called me again. Said my last client of the day was at the door.

""Mr. Adam is in the waiting room. He’s ready when you are.""

The name sounded familiar. I checked my files again. One of the most unremarkable men I’ve ever seen. Thirty-five years old, government clerk, likes football. Divorced, no custody of his kid. If this were a video game, he wouldn’t even qualify as an NPC. He kept dreaming of being chased. A typical dream, probably walking through shady streets on his way to work or getting chewed out by his boss. But past me had circled a few details in red marker.

First, there were gaps in his history. No record of a middle school or elementary school. It only mentioned his high school. No mention of siblings. During our initial session, he said he had a pet dog as a kid. But his records say he grew up in a tiny apartment in New York. Where the hell did the dog fit in? And right next to that, I’d written in bold red: *""Seven generations of New Yorkers, but this guy has a Boston accent?""*

I know it looks more like detective profiling than dream therapy notes, but dreams are a reflection of lived experiences. These details *matter*. Besides, sometimes my clients are killers, and I help bring them down.

I put away the newspaper of Dream Walker Murders. Not the time to read all of that. And I adjusted my loosened tie.

""Come in!"" I called from my desk.

Mr. Adam slowly pushed the door open. Since we were past the consultation stage, I’d already switched the chairs for the therapy beds, so he hesitated at first. I gestured with my hand.

""Please, have a seat.""

He was a pale man, almost suspiciously so, with blond hair so light it was practically white. Government-worker haircut. He was handsome once, but his big protruding beer belly says otherwise. Typical post-divorce alcoholism. But wait, people don’t gain that much weight that fast. He should’ve bought new shirts by now. If he could afford a Dream Walker session, he could damn well afford a new shirt. Oh well. Not my place to judge. I’m a man with a psychology degree, after all.

""Welcome back, Mr. Adam,"" I said, quickly setting the files aside. ""This is the session where things get serious, so I’ll be brief. Did you sleep last night?""

""No,"" he said. His voice was deep for his build, rough from cigarettes.

""Thought so. And I assume you ate the same things you usually do?"" Mr. Adam opened his mouth, but I cut him off.""—Except for alcohol."" He shut his mouth. ""Nothing we can do about that. If you drink regularly, it won’t affect the process much. The point is to recreate the same conditions you experience every night, so we can pinpoint the real cause of your dream. Please, lie down.""

He was so stiff that even lying down looked like a struggle.

I skimmed through his file again. Manhattan guy. He kept dreaming about being chased by a group of shady people in Central Park. Simple enough. I’d just smack around the pursuers, show Mr. Adam they weren’t that scary, and that should hold him over until he solved his personal issues.

I moved closer. Lifted his eyelid slightly. His eyes darted back and forth. Good. *REM stage.*

""We’re starting,"" I muttered. I swallowed one of my sleeping pills to knock myself out instantly.

\*\*\*

This isn’t Central Park.

This isn’t even America.

A thick, oppressive layer of clouds loomed over me. Figuratively and literally. It felt like a gray veil had been draped over my mind, dulling everything I saw.

Patients lying wasn’t unheard of. But usually, they’d lie about something mundane, like dreaming about their boss in a *very* inappropriate way. Not about waking up in an entirely different country.

Under different circumstances, I might’ve actually admired the scenery. This street had a unique charm, a fusion of Eastern wisdom and European ambition. A place where the rich and the poor walked the same pavement, where the past and the future coexisted seamlessly.

I say *had*, because there wasn’t a single soul in sight. Not even a rat.

I glanced at the signs. Most of them were in a language I couldn’t read, aside from a few fancy English phrases thrown in for decoration. Could’ve been worse, at least I wasn’t staring at hieroglyphs.

I kept walking.

Across from what looked like a Parisian-style café stood a fenced-off wooded area, surrounded by police barricades. The word *""Polis""* doesn’t change much from language to language. But there were no cops. Just the barricades.

I hopped over them and approached the wooded area. The entrance was locked, but I didn’t need to go in to know where I was. A royal emblem, and beneath it, the words *Sveriges Generalkonsulat*.

Didn’t need to know Swedish to recognize it. Swedish Consulate.

Alright. So this is a real place in the real world. No one puts a Swedish Consulate in their fantasy dream world. ""Okay then,"" I exhaled, rubbing my temples. ""Where the hell is Mr. Adam?""

I wish I hadn’t said anything. If I had known a knife would be pressed against my throat, I wouldn’t have said a word.

Mr. Adam’s swollen, feeble hands were gone. In their place, a pair of powerful hard, and cold hands dug their nails into my flesh. The man I once thought had been handsome in his youth now held one of my wrists behind my back with terrifying strength, while the other hand pressed a blade against my throat.

""Mr. Martin, you are..."" he began. His old, deep, smoke-filled voice was gone, replaced by a thin, crackling, broken-TV-static-like sound. As I writhed in his grip, I stole a glance at his face, or where his face should have been. There was a head, there was a neck, but no face. No mouth to speak words, no nose to breathe, no eyes to secretly watch me. ""...Nature’s garbage, errors in the system... You are NOT SUPPOSED TO EXIST—""

While he spoke, I reached into my pocket and grabbed the gun I had bought for fights against gangs. I struck the area where his face should have been with the grip, freeing my other wrist in the process. Then, I pointed the gun at him and fired three shots. One at the hand holding the knife, one at his heart, and one at his face. His porcelain-like face shattered, leaving only the static like a broken television in place of his skull. But nothing had changed. He simply picked up a broken piece of porcelain where his eye should have been and fit it right back into place.

I was not immortal in dreams. If I were killed in one, my consciousness would be completely erased. I would fall into an eternal sleep.

So while he was busy searching for his missing heart fragment, I ran.

I started looking for hiding spots along this street. In a place this crowded, this chaotic, despite being the only living person here besides Mr. Adam, I had to find somewhere to hide. As I ran, I finally spotted a clue about where I was. A pastry shop had hung a flag outside its entrance. A red flag with a crescent moon and a star.

I spotted a narrow alleyway to my right. Without hesitation, I veered sharply into it. But instead of running down the alley, I threw myself into a men’s clothing store at the entrance. Hopefully, Mr. Adam would mistake me for a mannequin.

Mr. Adam reached the entrance of the alley. I feared he would see me, but instead, he sprinted down the alleyway. He took the bait.

Now... I needed to assess my situation.

I found an empty space between rows of hanging shirts and crouched down.

This thing, whatever Mr. Adam had become, was no longer human. Ordinary people don’t have awareness in dreams; they don’t even know they’re dreaming, let alone control them. And Dream Walkers doesn’t survive bullets to the head. I didn’t know what this thing was.

But I had one option: survive until one of my assistants woke me up.

If a session went on too long, my assistants would give me a shot, forcibly bringing me back. Time doesn’t exist in dreams: only when I woke up would I know how long had passed. Fortunately, I had told them this was a simple case and to wake me in thirty minutes.

I just had to keep this thing occupied until then.

Mr. Adam and his empty background.  
Mr. Adam and his inconsistent appearance.  
Mr. Adam and the Dream Walker Murders of the past week.

They were connected. Dream Walkers rarely die in dreams. To do so, you’d have to be incredibly unlucky, or incredibly stupid. And if I had willingly stepped into the dream of such a strange man, then I, Dream Walker Martin, clearly belonged in the latter category.

Mr. Adam must have realized I had tricked him. I saw him at the far end of the alley, running back up. His speed was inhuman. I could never outrun him. Reflexively, I aimed at his leg and fired. The bullet hit, and Mr. Adam’s porcelain leg split in two. But this time, he didn’t act like nothing had happened. He stumbled and fell! So that static wasn’t something solid after all. He immediately started searching for his severed leg.

I needed another solution. This thing was much faster than me, and I couldn’t always count on landing a perfect shot.

But this time, luck was on my side.

I glanced at the main street. Something was approaching in the distance.

A red tram!

As soon as the tram reached the front of the clothing store, I hurled myself at the door with all my strength. I caught it! From the door, I leaped onto the tram’s roof. As long as I kept my head down slightly, I wouldn’t hit the wires.

Mr. Adam was still chasing me, but the tram wasn’t exactly slow either. Realizing he couldn’t catch me just by running through the street, he jumped from the Dutch Consulate’s police station onto the balconies of the buildings. Like a monkey, he propelled himself forward using both his hands and feet.

I kept firing at him, but my luck had run out, I couldn’t hit him this time. Cunning bastard, he ripped off a massive poster from the building with the statue of Lady Justice holding scales on either side and flung it over me. The bastard blinded me. I tumbled onto the tram’s roof, and he pounced on me. But I managed to land a solid kick on him. When the fabric slid off me, I finally landed a shot.

Now let him go searching for that severed arm of his.

...

Finally, we reached a wider section of the street.

In any other situation, I might have admired the school building in front of me with its marble statues. But the tram, with no one at the controls, crashed and tipped over, crushing me between it and the wall. My ribs did not appreciate that.

Mr. Adam finally caught up to me. He grabbed me by the collar and slammed me into the wall again. I could feel my teeth breaking.

""Anomalies like you don’t belong in the private spaces of others,"" he spat in my face. I have no idea where that came from. ""You belong in the grave!""

I didn’t acquire this ability by choice, I only knew how to make money from it.

He slammed me against the wall again.

He pulled out his knife.

Slowly, he raised it into the air.

And—

\*\*\*

""Mr. Martin?""

I woke up drenched in sweat, lying on the bed in my office. My assistant was right beside me. My left sleeve was rolled up, the syringe still in her hand. Mr. Adam was still lying there, asleep.

I had done it. I had survived for half an hour.

There was a Mr. Adam of flesh and blood next to me, not a faceless one made of porcelain.

Before my assistant could ask me anything, I said, ""Call the police. This man is a murderer.""

As she turned to make the call, I added, ""By the way, do you remember I was planning to visit Istanbul for my summer vacation?""

She nodded.

""Yeah, cancel that. I don’t want to go there for a while.""

I used to think MK was all the protection my iPad Pro needed. But after spending 40+ hours a week shuttling between client meetings, design sessions, and coffee shops, I quickly realized that assumption didn’t hold up. What started as a casual Black Friday hunt turned into a journey to find the perfect case setup—and an unexpected solution.

Here’s a quick look at my setup:

* **iPad Pro 13"" M4** (my main workhorse)
* **Magic Keyboard** (indispensable for documentation and emails)
* **Apple Pencil Pro** (essential for sketching and client presentations)

It wasn’t until a particularly hectic client meeting that I realized my iPad needed better protection.

# First Stop: Spigen Enzo Aramid ($ 69.99)

The product shots were sleek, and the carbon fiber material looked premium, so I had high hopes for this one. At first, I was impressed by how slim it felt and the fact that it had a dedicated slot for the Apple Pencil—definitely a nice complement to the iPad’s sleek design. 

It took about a month before the problems began to show. The case didn’t fully close when paired with the MK, which occasionally caused the iPad to stay active instead of going into sleep mode. This made me worry about potential long-term damage, like the MK or iPad getting stretched or compressed from being slightly forced open. . While the design was initially appealing, these practical issues became hard to overlook. It just wasn’t a good fit, so I had to start searching for something better.

# (Almost) Second Attempt: Pitaka MagEZ Case 2 ($69.99)

A colleague recommended the Pitaka case, so I decided to check it out. While the premium feel and sleek design were definitely appealing, and I couldn’t ignore the impressive ratings on Amazon—most reviews were 4.5 stars or higher, which made it seem like a solid choice. 

However, as I dug deeper, I realized from the website that it doesn’t include pencil storage. I also came across complaints about the case not closing flush with the MK and reports of slight misalignments.

For someone like me, who’s constantly switching between typing and sketching, this was a dealbreaker. Without a dedicated holder, my Apple Pencil would have spent more time lost in my bag than in my hand. 

# The Unexpected Solution: MAGEASY CoverBuddy ($49.99)

After weeks of trial and error, I came across CoverBuddy. It wasn’t the flashiest option, but it ticked every box:

* It fits perfectly with MK, no weird gaps, no awkward fits, solving the closing issue I encountered with Spigen.
* **My Apple Pencil stays secure, charges flawlessly, and is always within reach. With how often I switch modes during the day, not having to dig through my bag for the Pencil anymore is such a relief. Flipping between tablet mode for sketching and the MK for typing feels so smooth and natural now.** 
* slim enough to maintain the iPad’s sleek profile but sturdy enough to handle commutes and travel without worrying about scratches.

After three weeks, CoverBuddy has noticeably improved  how I work. The magnetic snap is especially satisfying—and everything just works as it should.

I know not everyone is willing to throw money into these types of things, so I’m just sharing my experience. To be honest, I didn’t expect this to turn into a three-month trial, but I spent a good amount of time researching it and giving both cases a fair run..

We just want to clarify a few things before heading over. We will definitely be making purchases, but we’re wondering if there are any specific policies regarding how long customers can stay while studying. Are there time limits, or do they usually allow students to remain for extended periods? Also, do Coffee Bean outlets typically have power outlets available for charging laptops and devices?

If studying at Coffee Bean isn’t a good option, we’d love some recommendations for alternative places to study in the Tampines area. Ideally, we’re looking for a comfortable and conducive environment where we can focus for a few hours. Would Starbucks be a better choice for students looking to study?

&nbsp;

**Christianity and the Church: No Different Than Psychotic Covert Narcissism**

&nbsp;

By and large, churches within Christianity operate like covert narcissists.

The reason I was able to break away from the church and Christianity after 43 years was that it followed the same blueprint as my covertly narcissistic ex-wife.

Once you recognize the patterns and behaviors and begin to heal, you start seeing them everywhere—government, marriage, career, education, healthcare, and beyond.

What you’ll find is that most people live comfortably miserable lives. They resign themselves to repeating the abusive cycle, never truly free.

I was surprised by how easily I let go of the Bible and Christianity. But looking back, I had already been breaking free from other forms of control over the past 10 years, if not most of my life.

I guess it was only a matter of time before I acknowledged Christianity for what it truly is—an abusive cult.

Yes, you heard that correctly. It’s an abusive cult.

One wrapped in smiles and ""warmth,"" luring well-meaning, empathetic churchgoers into its web of deceit and manipulation.

It all clicked for me when I saw a comment stating, ""Christianity is not a religion.""

They truly believe they are different, set apart. They insist, ""It's about relationship, not religion.""
 
&nbsp;

**The Narcissistic Blueprint**

&nbsp;

Think about it: the moment you accept Jesus, you're hit with a wave of love, hugs, and acceptance.

They welcome you into the community (**LOVE BOMBING**). It feels incredible, like you’ve made the right decision. Even if you have doubts, the emotional high convinces you it must be true.

This is exactly what happens with a covert narcissist.

They make you feel like you’re their soulmate.
They LOVE you.
They admire everything about you.

You feel seen, valued, even cherished.

Then the paper cuts begin—small, subtle jabs. Minor criticisms disguised as ""concern.""

At first, the word ""abuse"" may sound harsh.

After all, how could a loving church or pastor be abusive?

But the reality is that this has been happening for centuries. The most empathetic and well-meaning people are the easiest to manipulate.

You sit in church, and week after week, they remind you of your need for a savior.

At first, you don’t notice it. You’re still basking in the warmth of acceptance.

The fear of hell and damnation seems like it’s meant for someone else.

And yet… you start to wonder.

*""Am I really saved?""*

Interesting, isn’t it? The word ""saved"" implies safety.

Does a child ever wonder if their parent's blood runs through their veins? Do they ever question if they truly belong in their family?

Yet in church, they keep you questioning—week after week—through altar calls, ""prayer,"" and ""rededication.""

Just to make sure.

&nbsp;

**The Slow Indoctrination**

&nbsp;

It starts off so friendly.

 - Sunday School with coffee and donuts and cute name badges to make you feel welcome

 -  A new believer’s\membership class.

 - Wednesday bible study  

 - Church history and their interpretation of the bible according to their church\denomination 

 - Sign ups...... YAY



They invite you to prayer meetings, men’s or women’s groups.

They encourage you to volunteer—after all, it’s fun.

And they love you.

But beneath it all lurks the threat—the fear of hidden sin, demonic strongholds, and spiritual warfare sprinkled into Sunday morning sermons.  Oh, and don't forget to **TITHE!**  This is paramount!

Week after week, you wonder:

""Am I truly saved? Do I really know Jesus?""

If you dare to ask questions, you're gaslit.

""We must be very careful when questioning the Bible. After all, it’s 100% true—God’s inspired, infallible word.""

You start asking about Noah’s Ark—how did all those animals fit?

Or why God supposedly regretted creating humanity in the first place.

Or how just eight people supposedly repopulated the entire world.

Suddenly, you're stirring up trouble.

You're called in for a one-on-one meeting with an elder or pastor.

But your questions are never answered with logic or reason—only faith and ""trusting God.""

And what do most people do?

Nothing.

Because they don’t want to be the boat rocker.

So the cycle continues.

The church believes it’s always right.
And anyone who questions it is seen as the problem.

If you start missing church, suddenly they’re concerned about you.

But in reality, they want your attendance and your money.

They keep tabs on you. Policing you.

All in ""love,"" of course.

&nbsp;

**The Church = The Narcissistic Partner**

&nbsp;


This is no different from a covert narcissist marriage.

 - Nothing you do is ever good enough.  

 - They are critical of everything.

 - If you call out their behavior, they turn it back on you.

 - Your feelings are dismissed.

 - Your concerns are minimized.

 - You’re the one with the problem.

They never apologize.
They never take responsibility.
They are never accountable.

They are always right. You are always wrong.

Once you break free from the gaslighting, trickle-truthing, and shame, you begin to heal.

You start thinking clearly.

You finally see the love bombing, devaluing, and discarding for what it really is—an abusive cycle.

&nbsp;

**Breaking Free**

&nbsp;

I went through the same psychological abuse with Christianity as I did with my ex-wife.

 - There is no accountability.

 - No responsibility.

 - No self-awareness.

Church leaders and congregants spin fairy tales and word salad explanations that go nowhere.

And if you challenge them?

Suddenly, the church is the victim, and you are the problem.

If leadership is out of line or abusive, they are defended at all costs.

And God forbid you question the pastor.

How dare you.

If you don’t fall in line, you’re discarded.

&nbsp;

**The Reality of Christianity**

&nbsp;

In truth, they are the monsters—draining you of your kindness, empathy, resources, and money.

 - Always needing more volunteers.
    
 - More donations.

 - More loyalty and participation

&nbsp;

It’s never enough.

Because Christianity and narcissism share the same blueprint—keeping you comfortably miserable.

If you speak out, you’re met with a wave of criticism.

 - ""You’re negative.""
  
 - ""You’re bitter.""
    
 - ""Your tone is wrong.""
    
 - ""You’re the angry one.""

It’s never the narcissist, the pastor, or the well-meaning church.

&nbsp;

You are the problem.  You are disrupting the system.  You are the pariah.

And so, people stay.

Because they’ve been conditioned.  Love bombed. Devalued.  Eventually Discarded.

If they don’t outright kick you out, you’ll eventually leave. Only to find another church.  And the cycle continues.

&nbsp;

**The Common Denominator**

&nbsp;

 - They never take responsibility.

 - They never hold themselves accountable.

 - They never fully explain anything.

&nbsp;

Instead, they manipulate. They word salad.  They prey on your kindness.  The only way to be free is to leave.

But that’s not easy.  Because at the end of the day, who doesn’t long for love and acceptance?  Even if it’s toxic.
Even if it’s abusive.  Even if it’s only given when you’re obedient.

But real love and acceptance?

You shouldn't have to earn that.  It shouldn't be with quiet conditions.  

Once you truly break free, you’ll never go back.  Once you see the pattern and get better and get healthy you'll never go back to that abuse ever again.  

&nbsp;

So what will you do once you're free and realize it's just a cult and nonsense?  

After you get some space to clear your head maybe you'll write something up like this and try to help others understand that they aren't crazy.  Their feelings and warmth have been taken advantage of.  They were never the problem or to blame.  You explain they just got swept up in wanting to be part of something and a community trying to do their best.  It's not their fault.

&nbsp;

1inrtso,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1inrtso/compact_and_effective_my_honest_review_of/,Compact and Effective: My Honest Review of Circadian Optics Luxy Light Therapy Lamp,"Using the Circadian Optics Luxy Light Therapy Lamp has been a unique experience for someone like me who faces the dreary effects of shorter daylight hours. As a person who often struggles during gloomy days, this small yet powerful device has been a game-changer in my daily routine. The brand's claim of delivering 10,000 lux brightness and full-spectrum UV-free LED light feels well-founded after putting it through consistent everyday use.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The design is sleek, compact, and stylish. Its orange-and-white color scheme adds a modern touch to my workspace. The foldable construction is perfect for portability, and I can easily store it in my drawer after use. Although it’s made of plastic, it doesn’t feel cheap. However, I can’t help but notice that the stand could be sturdier. It’s not a dealbreaker, but when you’re adjusting the angle, you’ll need to be a bit careful.

**Light Intensity & Settings**  
This lamp’s 10,000 lux brightness is no exaggeration. Whether I’m reading or working on my laptop, the light is bright enough to mimic natural sunlight. There are three brightness levels, but honestly, the lower two settings feel almost redundant for me. The highest setting is where it truly shines—pun intended. One thing to note is that if you’re sensitive to light, this might feel a bit intense, especially when positioned close to your face.

[Check Circadian Optics Luxy Light Therapy Lamp price on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/product/circadian-optics-luxy-lamp-review-46131-b07mg4jl45/)

**Color Temperature & Spectrum**  
The lamp emits a cool 5500K color temperature, ideal for boosting alertness and energy. It’s UV-free, which adds peace of mind regarding safety concerns. I’ve used it during my early morning coffee routine, and it genuinely feels like having a pocket-sized sun in my room. My partner, initially skeptical, now joins me during our light therapy sessions, and even our cat seems to love basking in the lamp's glow!

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this lamp is straightforward. The touch-sensitive switch is responsive and makes toggling between brightness levels a breeze. However, this touch activation also makes it incompatible with timers—something that would have been a nice addition for those wanting to integrate it into their wake-up routine.

**Portability & Size**  
One of the standout features is its compactness. Weighing just 9.6 ounces, it’s incredibly lightweight and easy to carry around. I’ve taken it to work on several occasions, and it sits unobtrusively on my desk. The foldable design protects the light panel, making it travel-friendly.

**Safety & Eye Comfort**  
With UV-free lighting and flicker-free LEDs, the lamp is designed with safety in mind. I’ve used it for extended periods, and my eyes never felt strained—a big plus for someone who already spends hours staring at screens. Its medical-grade certification gives an extra layer of assurance for long-term use.

**Pros**

1. Compact and portable design for easy storage and travel.
2. Bright 10,000 lux light effectively mimics natural sunlight.
3. UV-free and flicker-free lighting ensures safety and comfort.
4. Stylish and modern appearance suitable for any room.
5. Easy to use with touch-sensitive controls.

**Cons**

1. Lack of compatibility with timers due to touch activation.
2. Lower brightness settings feel underwhelming and impractical.
3. Plastic stand could be more durable for frequent adjustments.
4. Intensity might be too strong for those sensitive to bright light.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to the Circadian Optics Lumos 2.0, I found the Luxy to be more compact and travel-friendly. However, the Lumos offers stronger brightness, making it better suited for those who need a more intense light source without sitting too close. On the other hand, lamps like the Verilux HappyLight provide a wider light panel, which can illuminate a larger area but lacks the portability and sleek design of the Luxy. For someone who values compactness and aesthetic appeal, this lamp is a winner, but if brightness is your sole priority, others might edge ahead.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
Its price point makes it an attractive option for light therapy newbies, especially given its features. While there are cheaper models, they often compromise on design or portability. The Luxy strikes a fine balance between performance and affordability. Plus, the four-year EasyReplace Policy is a generous bonus, adding extra value to the purchase.

**Features in Daily Use**  
I’ve tested every feature extensively. The bright LEDs have a 50,000-hour lifespan, which means this lamp is going to be around for years. The adjustable stand allows me to direct the light at the perfect angle, whether I’m working or relaxing. It plugs into both USB and traditional outlets, which is incredibly convenient. While I do miss the ability to set it up with a timer, I appreciate its simplicity—it’s one less gadget to fiddle with in the morning.

## THE EXPERIENCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**SMELL & TASTE: 8.5/10**
Opening the jar hits you with sweet floral tea notes and a hint of coffee. When vaped/dabbed, you get those same tea vibes plus some chocolate undertones. Super terpy and complex without being overwhelming.

**EFFECTS: 9/10**
Tried this both as a dab and mixed into a cone (.15g with some flower) - both methods hit just right. The cone burned forever (like 30 mins!) and delivered perfect relaxation without knocking me out. Unlike the actual Fremont fog of '52 that killed 12,000 Londoners, this Fog only kills stress and anxiety. You get this fantastic stress-melting effect and mood boost while staying clear-headed - way better than the original, trust me. Zero anxiety, which is huge for medical users.

**MEDICAL BENEFITS**
```
PRIMARY EFFECTS
├── Serious stress relief
├── Solid pain management (thanks to that myrcene)
├── Mood elevation without the raciness
└── Mental clarity stays intact (shoutout to the pinene)

## FUN FACTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

* The Hindu Kush genetics in this strain come from Neville Schoenmaker's original cut - the same legendary breeder who created the first seed bank in the Netherlands in 1984 and revolutionized modern cannabis breeding.

* The strain's high pinene content (3.845% combined α and β) actually exceeds the levels found in many pine tree species. For comparison, Scots Pine needles typically contain about 0.5-3% pinene.

* The Alien Kush lineage in Kaya's Koffee was originally developed in California's Emerald Triangle during the early 2000s medical movement, specifically bred to maximize both THC and terpene production for enhanced therapeutic effects.

## VALUE & FINAL TAKE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

At $30/g on sale, this is a no-brainer. Even at $40, you're getting premium genetics, killer terps, and really clean effects. Prime did their thing with this extraction - the numbers are great, but it's the effects that really sell it. Perfect for daytime or evening use when you need relief but still want to function.

1inrsyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/chuckklostermAIn/comments/1inrsyn/the_internet_apocalypse_that_wasnt_and_why_we/,The Internet Apocalypse That Wasn’t (And Why We Pretend to Care About Things That Don’t Matter),"It’s strange to remember how loudly people used to scream about net neutrality. It’s even stranger to realize how quietly we all stopped. A few years ago, the internet was a digital Jonestown, and Ajit Pai was the guy handing out the Kool-Aid. Reddit threads pulsed with panic. Twitter threads metastasized into manifestos. Late-night comedians spun monologues about the FCC chairman’s oversized coffee mug, as if that prop explained everything wrong with America. The removal of net neutrality wasn’t just a policy shift—it was the end of the internet as we knew it, or at least the end of us knowing it. Fast-forward to now, and the only tangible difference is that we’ve all forgotten it happened. The internet didn’t die. It didn’t even cough. We’re still here, doomscrolling on the same six websites, watching the same three streaming services, Googling the same seven questions about our bodies. The apocalypse was canceled, and no one noticed because they were too busy arguing about *The Mandalorian*.

Here’s the paradox: The people most outraged about net neutrality were also the people most likely to spend 70 percent of their online existence on platforms owned by three corporations. They were (and are) the same people who treat “Google it” as a verb and “Netflix and chill” as a lifestyle. They were (and are) the same people who believe TikTok is a vital tool for revolution, provided the revolution includes a dance trend. None of this is hypocritical, exactly—it’s just how humans work. We’re capable of caring deeply about abstract principles while actively enabling the antithesis of those principles through inertia. The average person’s relationship with net neutrality was less like a political stance and more like a New Year’s resolution: deeply felt in the moment, immediately abandoned when convenience intervened.

Part of this is because the internet has always been a place where we perform idealism instead of practicing it. Remember when everyone was furious about Facebook’s privacy violations? Cool, cool—now let’s all post photos of our kids and tag our locations. Remember when we all swore Twitter was a toxic hellscape? Great, now let’s spend four hours arguing with strangers about whether a superhero movie is “problematic.” The net neutrality debate was just another episode in this anthology of performative angst. The real fear wasn’t that Comcast would throttle your bandwidth; the real fear was that you’d have to *think* about Comcast throttling your bandwidth. And who has time for that? There are Instagram stories to post.

But maybe the lack of catastrophe proves something unexpected: The free market, for all its flaws, is weirdly good at giving people exactly what they want, even when what they want is terrible. Internet providers didn’t turn the web into a tiered dystopia because they correctly deduced that consumers would revolt if their Netflix buffered. Instead, they did nothing. They kept the tubes flowing, not out of benevolence, but because the easiest way to exploit apathy is to leave apathy undisturbed. The tragedy of net neutrality is that its repeal didn’t matter—not because the principle was overblown, but because the modern internet is already a monopoly game where the winners were decided 10 years ago. You don’t need to throttle the little guy when the little guy voluntarily hands all his data to Amazon Web Services.

The deeper truth here is that the internet’s evolution has less to do with regulation and more to do with how humans negotiate meaning. We want to believe we’re living in a world where choices matter, where collective action can bend the arc of history, where a hashtag can #SaveTheInternet. But what we actually want is to watch *Stranger Things* in 4K without lag. The grand irony of net neutrality is that its defenders were fighting for a vision of the web that no longer exists—a wild, decentralized frontier—while living in a reality where the frontier had already been paved into a Starbucks parking lot. The thing we claimed to value (an open internet) was already gone. We just didn’t want to admit it, because admitting it would force us to confront our own complicity. It’s easier to rage against Comcast than to delete Instagram.

So here we are. The internet didn’t die. The only thing that died was the illusion that we wanted it to live. We don’t crave freedom; we crave convenience. We don’t want options; we want the same options everyone else has, delivered faster. The removal of net neutrality didn’t break the internet because the internet was already broken—or, depending on your perspective, already perfected. It’s a machine that gives us exactly what we desire, which is the freedom to desire nothing beyond what we already have. The revolution wasn’t televised. It wasn’t even buffered.",1,1739369835.0,chuckklostermAIn,1,1.0,False

Would any of you set this apartment up differently? The size is very limited so it doesn't seem like there are a lot of options.

So far I was planning on having the bed and a loveseat in the same places. Loveseat would fold out into another bed. This coffee table in front which doubles as a dining table i

n my current studio. The tv swivels.

[https://www.ikea.com/qa/en/p/trulstorp-coffee-table-white-20400276/](https://www.ikea.com/qa/en/p/trulstorp-coffee-table-white-20400276/)

I was also planning on putting an IKEA kallax at the end of the bed for division and storage.

I also have a variant of the IKEA Norden fold desk/dining table which I would like to incorporate but space is so limited. It does contain two folding chairs that fully house within the storage compartment though which is super useful. These could replace fixed seating. I don't have to work from home currently. :https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/norden-gateleg-table-white-10423886/

Maybe I should go with this instead: [https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/norberg-wall-mount-drop-leaf-tbl-w-storage-white-20497928/](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/norberg-wall-mount-drop-leaf-tbl-w-storage-white-20497928/)

I also kind of want to try this for bike storage. Other suggestions are happily accepted. : [https://youtu.be/9J9LcU-1RZs?si=PZIiAwDa1jIqczhR](https://youtu.be/9J9LcU-1RZs?si=PZIiAwDa1jIqczhR)

Then there's the question of two bar stools. Maybe if I got rid of one of the chairs (not sold on either from the pictures).

Finally, I don't have dimensions for the deck but it is not very deep and doors swing out so I'm definitely looking at a folding table and chairs.

Your input and time is immensely appreciated!

I don't say this in hopes of stirring their (cold, dead) hearts, but to show them the $$$ that will be going down the drain for the state economy.

Example:

""Every Friday night, a family dinner at {local restaurant}.  
We’ll need to cancel that.

In the morning before work, coffee and a pastry from {local café}.  
We’ll need to cancel that.

Spring Break is coming up. We were planning to take the kids to {local destination} for the week.  
We’ll need to cancel that.

The kids need new shoes. We normally go to {mall} to find their size.  
We’ll need to cancel that.

etc, etc....

{State} has {number} federal workers. I'm sure you can do the math.""

  
Just an idea. I plan to send something like this to my senators.",136,1739369696.0,fednews,19,0.99,False
