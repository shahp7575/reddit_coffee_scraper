For many years I just relied on pour over coffee, but now I'd like to be able to make my owns lattes in a small kitchen with as little fuss as possible - would you recommend the pico or nano or mini? Also plan to get one of those milk frothing wands. 

It seems like with some of these devices you can only use pods? Are the pods only devices easier? For pour over I've always just relied on pre ground coffee. ",1,1737187071.0,picopresso,0,1.0,False

She clearly has an affair with that man…”

Eric shrugged Ingrid off of his arm. His tone was sullen as he coldly spat out. “That man is Grant Stanton from West City. He’s someone you can’t afford to mess with.”

He began to be doubtful. ‘Was the divorce not just my problem? Perhaps the entire Ferguson family is the problem…’

Ingrid was stupefied. Although she had never met Grant Stanton, every woman in the elite circle knew that he was the most eligible bachelor in West City. He was so mysterious and noble. Countless women would bend over backward just to marry this man, but Nicole was with him?

She was vexed. Since her brother did not back her up, she could only turn to others for help. Ingrid immediately made a phone call. “Keith, Nicole bullied me. You have to help me…”
......

At Grant Stanton’s office in the Stanton Tower, Nicole watched as Grant made her a cup of coffee with skill and grace. Just then, she received a call from Dominic Young, the President of Falcon Entertainment. “Nicole, I got insider information that Ms. Ferguson found someone to follow you discreetly. Do you need help to solve this?”

Nicole pursed her lips slightly and smiled. Her gaze was indifferent. “Nah, let her be. I’ll just go with the flow. It’ll save me some publicity fees.”

After she hung up, Grant frowned slightly and paused for a moment. “What is it?”
“Ms. Ferguson hired someone to follow me. Let her be.”

Grant did not take it to heart because these little tricks were within their control. He handed over an aromatic cup of coffee he just made for her. “Careful, it’s hot.”

Nicole smiled and took it, then closed her eyes to savor the smell. “Your coffee is the best, much better than the world’s top baristas. I think you’ll definitely make it big if you open a cafe.""

Grant snorted and cast her a helpless glance. “No one but you can afford to drink my coffee.”

Nicole tasted the coffee with great satisfaction and suddenly remembered something. “Since I’m officially starting my job tomorrow, can I ask Yvette to be my right hand and help me for a few days?”

Grant nodded without much thought, “Whatever, just make your own arrangements.”

Thinking about the way Yvette looked at Grant, Nicole excitedly sent Yvette a message.

[Okay, you’re officially starting work tomorrow!]

Yvette replied immediately. [Yes, ma’am!]

Yvette was from the affluent Quimbey family. When Yvette offered to help Nicole, she only planned to spend more time with Nicole and Grant. Nicole saw through her intentions but did not expose her because she also wanted her best friend and big brother to be together.

Nicole was in a great mood and happily left for their date. The two ladies then went to a bar they frequented.

Tattle Bar was lively with raucous music. The bass and the beats made them immerse themselves in the music.

Yvette was delighted to be starting work at Stanton Corporation, so she let loose and partied to her heart’s content. After some drinks, they went up to the dance floor. These two ladies were incredibly beautiful with outstanding temperaments, which immediately attracted a lot of attention. One was sexy and passionate, and the other was aloof and regal.

Although Yvette was starting to slur her words, she still wanted to continue drinking. Nicole was a little helpless when she saw this. She took Yvette’s hand and shouted over the music, “I’m going to the bathroom, so wait for me here!”

Yvette just waved her hand in assurance.
Nicole came back after a few minutes. Her face instantly sank when she saw a tall, burly man standing next to Yvette.

The man had long noticed the two ladies dancing by themselves. When he saw that Yvette was alone, he became horny and went up to pull Yvette into his arms. He did not expect Nicole to come back so quickly and looked askance at her.",1,1737186861.0,GoodNovelHub,0,1.0,False

I’m a 26 year old med student, and I feel like I have no idea how to manage my finances. I currently have no savings account, no investments, no insurance, and very little understanding of how to build financial stability.

My only source of money is from my allowance na around 10-15k per month (usually closer to 10k). I have no bills naman to pay except for food and coffee. Never really gave much thought about this before. I thought I would have more time later on but my senior father is single handedly handling all these expenses. halos wala din siyang savings and no insurance or businesses, and hes getting old. Plus tatlo kami in college/ grad school at the same time. I used to have savings bc I worked before med school, pero naubos lang din sa kaka online shopping. 

Am going to be irreg next school year, so im planning on working to save up for living expenses for clerkship/PGI.

I’d love advice on:
- Where do I even start with saving and investing? Is it even possible with just my allowance?
- Should I prioritize getting insurance?
- How can I budget while being a full-time student with limited income?

Anyway, in the midst of this, my one job hired a new guy.  At first I thought he was a goofy guy.

1i42cis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1i42cis/title_and_author/,Title and author?,"Misty
Misty carefully lifted her hand and felt across the top of the bathroom counter. Finally, she located her brush. Picking it up, she ran it through her long golden brown hair. She loved her hair, as it was the same colour as her mothers, and wished with everything she had that she could see it now. 
Almost two years ago, she was driving to dinner with her parents. 
An impaired driver crossed the median and hit their car head on. Both her parents were killed instantly. She suffered quite a few cuts and bruises, but the most damage she received was to her head. 
The back of her head slammed into the side window from the impact. The doctors told her she had significantly damaged the optical cortex. It caused her to suffer a partial blindness, meaning she is only able to see shadows and shapes. 
Her brother Noah was a marine and been stationed in Afghanistan at the time. He was given leave to come home and attend the funeral. 
He also stayed long enough to make sure she was settled, then he was
under orders to go back. He had to sell her parents house, to pay for the funerals and her medical bills, so he had moved her into his apartment. Since he was engaged to Carly, and she was their only family, Misty was now in her care. 
Unfortunately, as soon as Noah left, Carly showed her true colours. 
She hated being Misty’s caregiver and was constantly making it known. Plus, Misty was pretty sure Carly was seeing someone else behind her brothers back. 
Her brother only called about once or twice a month, and with him stationed in the middle of a battlefield, Misty knew she couldn’t burden him with her problems. She put up with Carly’s abuse and went on with her life. 
Most days she sat at home and read on the Braille book reader her brother had bought her. She also liked to pop in her ear buds and listen to music on her iPod. Sometimes she ventured to the park down the street, but even that was difficult. 
Today, Carly insisted on driving her to a coffee shop, and she planned on leaving her there while she went to run a couple errands. 
She promised she would only be about forty-five minutes, then she would pick her up and take her back home. Misty didn’t really want to go, but she knew she needed to start getting out more. 
That’s why she had been searching for her hairbrush. She kept begging Carly not to move her things, but of course Carly told her she needed to clean, and to do that she had to put things away. 
Sometimes it took Misty an hour to find her things after Carly cleaned. It was frustrating and some days she even shed a few tears. Misty knew Carly did it on purpose, just to upset her. 
Misty finished in the bathroom, and grabbed her cane, heading out to living room in search of Carly. She finally found her waiting by the door as Carly liked to ignore her when she called. 
Misty sighed and followed her out of the apartment and downstairs to her car. She was careful on the stairs as Carly never helped. Once they had made it to the car, she opened the door and climbed in. 
She hoped her afternoon was better, but didn’t have very high hopes. Life just wasn’t what she expected it to be anymore, and she was beginning to lose hope of it ever getting better. 
----------
Misty sat at the table in the coffee shop, drinking her tea. She figured she had been waiting about two hours now for Carly, but she couldn’t see the clock to know for sure. She was actually getting nervous, wondering what she would do if Carly actually left her here. 
She wouldn’t put it past her. Carly had made her wait longer than she told her before, but this was well beyond that. 
Misty started to shuffle back and forth in her seat. She had drank two cups of tea, as Carly had told the waitress to bring her a second cup once the first cup was gone, before she had left. Now however, the tea was starting to move through her, and she knew it wouldn’t be long before she’d be desperate for a bathroom. 
She shifted again and cringed when she heard her cane hit the ground. Leaning over, she patted the surrounding floor, searching for it. With no luck, she huffed in agitation. She knew this day would be bad, but this was humiliating. 
Suddenly, there was a shadow at her side. She heard the person bend down and pick up her cane. “If you hold out your hand, I can place the cane in it, and then you can put it where it’s easy for you,” a female said. 
Misty nodded and did as told. Instantly, the cane was placed in her hand. “Thank you,” she told the kind woman. She heard a chair scrape as the woman sat down. 
“I don’t mean to intrude,” she said. “But I noticed you’ve been sitting here for an awfully long time. Do you need a ride somewhere?” 
Misty smiled at the kindness. “No, actually my roommate should be along shortly. She ran some errands, and I guess it’s taking her longer than she expected.” 
“I’m Ali,” the woman said. “Do you mind if I sit with you, while you wait? I really don’t like sitting alone, and I have to wait for my husband, anyway.” 
“Sure, I’m Misty, she told her, not wanting to sit by herself any longer either. 
“Do you mind me asking if you were born blind,” Ali asked. And that was the start of her new friendship. She told Ali all about the accident as well as her prognosis, and all about her brother Noah. She told her about Carly as well, but left out all the bad stuff. Ali listened and seemed to really care about her answers. 
Misty starting wiggling again, desperate to go to the bathroom. 
Then, she heard the chair scrape as Ali got up. “I’ve had a bottle of water, and I need to use the restroom, do you want to come with me before our rides get here?” 
Misty couldn’t get out of her seat fast enough. “Yes please,” she said. She sighed in relief as Ali took her arm and led the way. In the bathroom, Ali was amazing. She led her to a free stall and helped her inside, then showed her where the toilet paper was. 
When she was done, Ali was there again leading her to the sink. This time she casually told her which side the soap was on and how many steps to the paper towels. 
Misty couldn’t believe how easy Ali made everything. She didn’t make her feel like she was disabled at all and talked to her like a normal person. When they got back to the table, she helped her grab her things so they could wait outside. 
She was surprised when Ali asked for her phone so that she could put her number in. Noah had bought her a special phone with braille on it, so she could use it without needing to see it. She told Ali to enter her number under three and waited while Ali did as she asked. Then she heard Ali’s phone ding, as she called herself so she could have her number. 
Then, she cringed as she heard Carly call her name. She sounded extremely impatient and almost upset with her. Ali gave her a quick hug, telling her they’d talk soon. Then, she reluctantly made her way to Carly and got in the car. 
She was thrilled she had a new friend and really hoped she heard from Ali again. She really liked the woman and hoped this could be the beginning of something positive for her. 
----------
It had been two weeks since Misty met Ali. They had only talked on the phone once since that day, but Misty hadn’t realized that she was pregnant. Apparently, she was due any day now, and her husband didn’t want her far away from him. She loved that for her new friend and hoped one day she could have the same thing. 
Carly had been busy this week and hadn’t been around much. She worked full time as a receptionist at a dental office, but Misty had no idea where she went in the evenings. It worried her, but in all honesty, she liked it when she was gone. Things were easier without the added stress of always worrying what kind of mood she would be in the day. 
Misty jumped as Carly called her name, she hadn’t even heard her enter the room. “It’s nice out, and you’ve been hiding inside too long. 
Come on, we’re going for a drive,” she ordered. 
Misty signed, but didn’t want to deal with Carly’s attitude if she said no. She reached for her cane, and followed her out the door. 
“Where are we going,” she asked Carly, as they made their way down the stairs and outside. 
“It’s early evening,” she said. “I thought we could go for a walk down by the lake, maybe sit at one of the picnic tables for a bit.” 
They’d reached the car, so Misty opened the door and climbed in. 
A walk by the lake would be nice, but she didn’t trust Carly. She had learned that she had to be on her toes whenever they left the house. 
The lake was only a five minute drive, so it went really quick. 
Misty got out, loving the feel of the breeze from the lake on her face. 
Maybe things would go well this time, she thought. She listened for Carly’s footsteps and followed her to the water. 
Misty was extremely familiar with the lake. Before her accident, she used to take a ton of pictures. She loved scenery, and this was one of her favourite spots. 
She had gotten so good that her brother had set her up with her own website. She framed her photographs and sold them, even taking requests for certain shots. 
She missed it terribly and was worried about her website. She hadn’t seen it since the accident, and Carly refused to help her. Maybe Ali would be willing to take a look at it for her. 
She didn’t have any new photos, but she could reprint some of her favourites, and try to sell them. She hated not being able to help out her brother with the expenses. 
Her and Carly were sitting at a picnic table, enjoying the weather, when Carly’s phone suddenly rang. She tried to listen, but Carly got up and walked away, obviously not wanting her to overhear. 
When Carly came back, she told her. “That was a friend of mine. I need to go, so you’ll have to walk back.” 
“What,” Misty asked horrified. There was no way she could walk home. “Drop me off on the way,” she pleaded. 
“I don’t have time,” Carly said with agitation in her voice. “Just walk straight out to the road and follow it home. You can see shadows, so you should be fine.” 
Then Carly turned and walked away. Misty called her name, but she was ignored. As she listened, the car started and pulled out of the lot. 
Misty was near tears. It was getting later, making it almost impossible for her to even see shapes. How in the world was she supposed to find her way home?",1,1737185207.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

    Before writing, I am writing using Google Translator, so please understand my awkward English.
    
    I was on the verge of making a choice I shouldn't have made due to CPPS symptoms that started in the winter of 2022.
    
    I had all the symptoms of CPPS
    
    1 Urination disorder
    2 Testicular pain, perineal pain, anal pain
    3 Sexual dysfunction
    
    And now, except for nocturia once a day and frequent urination when I drink coffee or carbonated drinks occasionally, I am completely free.
    
    If someone asks me how I got better, I can answer with confidence.
    
    1 Accept the symptoms with some patience
    2 I maintain many of my good habits and thoroughly stop my bad habits.
    3 Exercise and stretching are essential, not optional
    
    At first, I met a doctor who treated the pelvic floor muscle tender points and spent a lot of time using the plvic wand on my own, but there was no significant effect.
    
    As I adjusted my eating habits, walked more than usual, stretched often, and thought positively, all my symptoms began to improve very slowly.
    
    I took a leave of absence for over a year and spent a huge amount of money trying to get rid of this disease, but it was all in vain. Now, I accept everything and go about my daily life taking deep breaths, walking, and stretching whenever I feel uncomfortable.
    
    To all CPPS patients! I know how hard it is for you
    
    But you will definitely come back when things get better!

1i4289e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i4289e/a_couple_of_my_friends_can_never_afford_to_eat/,A couple of my friends can never afford to eat out but spend $50-100 or sometimes over $100 worth on Shein,"Hey y’all, ik this is stupid, I don’t mean to come off conceited but I came to the realization that I have no friends from my hometown that will explore new restaurants/eat out with me. This is not to say I want to go to super boujee or expensive places, but I live near Chicago and the city is full of different cafes and restaurants  of different cultures that my hometown does not offer. I’m not asking them to spend $50 on a meal, but $10-25 is a reasonable range depending on the amount of food you get? Is it not? I never really ask them to get food anymore because they often cannot because they cannot afford it-understandable sure, but then somehow at any special occasion, holiday, etc, they are able to order a fresh new wardrobe of $100-200 worth of Shein clothes (I hate shein btw).

Maybe our priorities are different? I hate consumerism and believe that experience and food should be prioritized in ones spending habits. I also believe that no one needs 20 new “going out” shirts. Btw yes I forgot to mention we are all in college. 

I brought it up to my parents and they said they never ate out in college really. But my parents really both grew up poor (like my dad worked on a farm in the middle of Ohio), but achieved success and now we live in a preeettyyyy wealthy neighborhood. My parents said they started eating out and getting drinks after college once they got a real job. But I’m not asking my friends to eat at super fancy places nor am I asking them to go out all the time? I think in the last 2 years we’ve all gone out to eat 2-3 times, and it’s always so awkward when some friends do not expect to pay $20 for their meal and drinks, and act suprised/upset when they do so. On top of this they act baffled when they’re expected to leave a tip! So I really just stopped asking tbh to avoid the whole process. 

Am I having too high of expectations too early? I just think when we’re all young and beautiful is the time to go out and explore! Ofc age will never stop me but it’s a great feeling to be young and take on a large city by yourself or accompanied with your girlfriends. 

But is it rude if you ask a friend out to eat a couple days in advance and when the time comes they say they’ve already eaten? And they refuse to order anything? 

I have friends who rarely eat out because they actually cannot afford it. But they do not agree to get food with me then, nor do I really ask. I wait until they ask me then I jump at the opportunity. Or we just get $5 coffees, but my hometown friends don’t even want to spend that! Idk yall. Sometimes if I ask my one friend out to eat to try a new place she’ll just tell me she doesn’t have enough money. Which is totally okay and also avoids that whole awkward process above I just mentioned! Idk yall. Let me know your thoughts.",3,1737184682.0,Advice,15,0.8,False

1i4278r,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelwriting/comments/1i4278r/deceasedmy_novel/,Deceased(my novel),"The Detective, however, failed in the court due to the silence of defendant, he promised to defend himself along with The Detective for defeating the judge and the capitalist. He failed, failed on purpose, even though there's a chance of being victor, he rejected somehow, The Detective was confused to see defendant fade away his words which's supposed to be suitable for proofs. The judge was delighted, and the capitalist was in the same confusion as The Detective. The Detective, his failure, which could have been a success had deceased, murdered by the man whose hope was destroyed by himself.

Samuf Turrison, a gentleman in his thirties always tends to meet some problems on the road to the next day. He struggled to overcome the night, feared by ultra-realistic nightmares, annoyed by his two sons complaining about the father's despair for sitting tight at home. He's a rejected man by society, family and eventually himself, an adult like him phased out, to be a fake philosopher reading a few books in his locked room. It is touchable, touched by his old smoky fingers, his bias on such seemed to be a little bit overaching in the wake of his miserable life happened a week ago.

The two capitalists, let's call them Viktor and Erik. Viktor was a lawyer as a college student, later he succeeded to the property mentioned in his father's testamentary. Erik, Viktor's brother, majored in finance following his father's will, recruited by him owing to Erik's mind for business, with him harnessing all advantageous elements to run the company, its boom came frequently, flourishing almost every month. Viktor soon arrived the destination from capital, he received the message sent by the judge which was shocked to find out Erik murdered when his bodyguards reported to him. The victim was found, but the murderer, no signs.

A week ago, Erik found murdered outside his lawn. His head was smashed by a shovel, barely to identify, along with that, a woman, was found shot in bed, six bullet holes on the head, breasts, the abdomen, and the lower. The police examined the bodies, they found the fingerprints indicated to a middle-aged man and the bullets inside the woman identified as a revolver, an old one. The murder took place at midnight, the moment every resident was asleep except the neighbor, who was watching pornographic footages with pants off. The police recorded his words:

""Just when I was watching movies, you know. I heard a man shouting, or two. He's like, yelling out MY LIFE IS FUCKING RUINED! EVEN MY MOST BELOVED ONE DESERTED ME! I'M A MISERABLE CREATURE ABANDONED BY GOD! Oh Jesus, I paused the movie and looked outside, two shadows in chaos, I could see the guy holding something hitting another, even if he's already fallen over without a single twitch. That's a blurry and dark sight. Later, I heard a woman screaming like a witch on fire PLEASE FORGIVE ME! PLEASE IT'S MY FAULT, I'M SO SORRY, I WOULD NOT DO THIS AGAIN! Then there're just shots, six rounds. The noise phased out, the shadow drove away, but I couldn't see his number. Too dark!""

The Detective listened to the tape once again, especially the noisy part uneased the colleagues' emotions. Their pays and promotions are the only dedication to the case. An ordinary murder case closes in the same way, even the victim is a capitalist. The Detective, was told to shut down the radio by others due to the staff were in the nap with dreams to be the only one shelter to settle down, the minutes before wake-up could be delighting. The Detective isn't that type, he's woke, nerve tight as always, leaving other officers an impression of insanity, like a psychopath escaped from an asylum, particularly with a Sherlock Holmes suit on all the year. The Detective went out to the bar, watching the news. The news was reporting a retreat of troops in a third-world country, which is a kind of boredom to him. He ordered a whiskey, enjoying this boredom to fill the blank of his thoughts on the case. He wanted to know the witness, to reach the next level of the murderer, or the conspiracy behind the whole system. A sick soicety needs an insane man to recover, which is an unacceptable truth to the public.

The key was to be found...

A day later, the murderer captured in the basement, the condition absolutely fitted a drunkard: Dim lights, rubbish and bottles on the dirty wet ground, damp walls made a perfect habitat for insects to settle, and rats would hold a party every night to drive someone insane, varieties of liquor bottles randomly dropped on the ground implied the failure kind of lifestyle that the owner insist. The man, without any clothes on lying on the floor with disgusting liquid splashed all around, was holding a beer bottle in his smelly mouth, like a baby sucking a nipple. The two teenagers directed policemen to the secret basement of their father, the cops flashed the man, he just woke up, seeing lights coming to prison him. The police came close, grabbing his arms and legs one by one, and dragged him outside. The man seemed to be fearful, he didn't understand how the police found him. He at first required a miserable decease belongs to a middle-aged style, but he even failed on this. The man saw his sons, glaring at him for the matter, which their mother got killed.

The witness, outside the bar awaiting, as The Detective came out he rushed to him. He told The Detective, the proof was a conspiracy, the tape was recorded by The Detective's colleagues to form a shield of distraction, even the very words he related was prescripted due to the will of cops to seal the truth. The Detective wasn't so surprised, he asked the witness to go into the bar, the witness told him everything about the murder, he saw the whole process, with a footage recorded, yet the vision was dark and blurry, the voice was clear, it was a whole difference from the previous tape, which drew The Detective into constant confusion. The witness knew the murderer well, he clarified that such a irreversible situation would ruin his friend's rest of life, and he wished the murderer would not be found ever, therefore the witness dialed his number to remind the murderer to escape from this corrupted town covered in justice while the opportunity haven't faded away yet. So the chance was given to him, however, he refused to take it and eventually got reported to the police by his sons. Samuf Turrison could have a chance to run away, that's what the witness meant. He currently felt sinful for being witness, he regreted for himself being the assistance factor of Turrison held captive. He was his friend, the only one. But even the only friend, whose will was dedicated to save him, betrayed Samuf Turrison.

The police, knew the witness well, they already held the information of the relationship between him and the murderer. Thus when the case was reported to them, the first thing they did was to interrogate the neighbor, he was scared of them breaking into his door all of a sudden, lips shaking to tell anything he could share, the police stared at him sitting on the chairs with finger crossed, their fine sitting order terrified the neighbor, seemed like the cops installed a camera in his bedroom. Six minutes had passed, the neighbor's phycology defense eventually crashed as one police officer started lighting a cigarette impatiently, indicating that they knew everything from the file, just wait to see the neighbor commit himself a witness, whether he's clear or not. The black box effect on the neighbor had forced himself to be a witness, or an assistant. As a result, the tape considered useless successfully confused The Detective, which made him shocked than being mad.

A communist lawyer came, as one of Turrison's basic human rights, he's allowed to have a lawyer with him. The Detective met him at the door, the lawyer acquired a talk with just Turrison and himself. The Detective left, smoking to empty his mind. He didn't know why his colleagues cheated on him. His character? Motivation? Or even confrontation against the whole system? It's sure The Detective denies its legislation right on the judge's face during the hotel ball dance. The judge remembered that. The lawyer came out, saying Turrison had agreed with the suggestions. The Detective doubted that, he knew Turrison was a tough person. But his acceptance towards a communist seemed to be the key, The Detective thought to himself, he's unsure about it, and blurry about the ideology of Samuf Turrison. He rushed to the door as the communist lawyer went out, The Detective tried talking to him, longing for information hidden between the lawyer and Turrison to be delivered, however, concrete ones weren't related instead of an abstract motto created by the lawyer seconds ago: ""Everything involved in politics is a demon in disguise, even the most ideal purists become degenerates under the impact of the system.""

The key was broken the next day.

The lawyer was never to be found. This gave The Detective the faith to unveil the black box covering the masked men, various masks, with smiling, weeping, yelling, varieties of emotions were the reflex of the system that already hid its true matter. He suspected the lawyer was killed, but where? He couldn't just imagine a destination that's fit for his death. What if he's not killed? His identity could have him done that way, however, the system runs democracy to determine the fate of the lawyer: Deserted. That's not quite right as well, the lawyer could have related it to him, since it's the invitation from The Detective. What if he's forced to keep the secret? Considering the possibility of him escorted by a team of system protectors sent by the judge. There's one thing to be sure: The lawyer wasn't bribed. He's a true communist, and officials in the system are true anti-communists. The police are just slaves modified to be Chinese figure.

The judgment day was close. In the cell, Samuf Turrison counting his days to be defeated in the court, and finally on the road to jail. The whole society seemed to be his enemy in the blink of an eye. His companions failed him over and over. By stupidity, by ideology, or by powerless figure. The Detective was the third one, his disproved mentality retained vulnerability, making it nearly impossible to take a confrontation against even the first level of the system. His motions were perfectly handled by allies, which already looked at him with high noses. He didn't want to admit this is a war he never wins, even a small campaign could take him down in one bit. Facing the system without a systematic group would be regarded a fiasco in one's rest of the life, deserted by the society. The Detective made the decision, he required a lawyer seat in the court, as Turrison's. The judge agreed, he knew The Detective, his will to defend Turrison was a plot for the judge, a naive plot but no way back. They two were meant to acquire a destined failure in the very end.

Samuf Turrison, glanced at The Detective, they did this for ten minutes and Turrison talked, ""Your courge has accepted the fate of career fiasco, your life has accepted the fate of living in the desert."" The Detective replied, ""My sacrifice has overcome the misery. My brand new life starts from the judgment."" The Detective asked Turrison to make a promise, a promise to fully defend himself in the court. Turrison accepted to his demand, but as soon as he left, he took the words back in the heart.

The judgment began, the jury sat loose, they regarded the trial a comedy. However, the witness' nerves were tight, he knew the destiny coming to his friend, still feared to see it come. He closed the eyes, but soon open up unwillingly, next to him were Turrison's two sons, they view the trial as NAZIS being sentenced to death or life in prison. Samuf Turrison saw all of this, and bizarre confidence planted inside of The Detective. The captalist, whose emotion presented on his face seemed unwilling but somehow embracing a sense of responsibility, Turrison considered himself a tool right after he sat beside The Detective. Their duties were corrupted by politics, and the judge took it as a talk show with a sip of coffee, watching clowns playing around with stupidity in his realm of dictatorship. At this moment, Turrison remembered the words related by the lawyer in the chamber:

""Once politics, all time politics.""

Samuf Turrison, The Detective, The judge, Viktor himself, came to their seats. They all understood the trial was pointless, even though the defendant had numerous proofs to overwhelm Viktor. The destiny remained unchanged. Whether being victor or being loser, its significance had been washed away by the whole system. Turrison knew that, so did The Detective. He wished to perish in a glorious way, as a marker that he at least held a lonely demonstration towards it. But the fate itself, loves to be tricky.",1,1737184561.0,novelwriting,0,1.0,False

Not in dire straits or anything, but the struggles of early adulthood are starting to pile on and crush you slowly. 

Well it’s easier to get through things when you have friends, and so I’m happy to provide that comfort if you’d like! We can talk about the perils of life as well as the triumphs we have. Tell me about how you spilled your coffee on your lap on the way to the store, or maybe how you got a good grade on an exam. I want to share the stupid simple things. I like the mundane happenings of people’s lives and I’d love to hear what you’re doing even if you think you’re boring. 

As long as you’re around my age (18-21) and willing to put some effort in the rest of the details of your life are irrelevant. Everyone is welcome. I can’t promise we’ll be besties but I tend to get along with most.

It's the first time I'm venturing out of the Arabica and Robusta and also my first honey processed coffee (I didn't get the difference between honey process and black honey as Subko says, if any). I have only tried naturals and washed coffee until now.

Out of the box, the coffee really had strong notes of jackfruit as mentioned on the packaging, like REALLY strong. We had a jackfruit tree in my childhood home, so I know how strongly it resembles the smell of ripe jackfruit. It's intense, lease to say.

I don't know about muskmelon, but the wet notes of the coffee reminded me of cakes that have banana and loads of other fruits in them. The scent was really sweet, although the coffee itself is not as sweet as it smells.

However it isn't even bitter or too acidic, it was well-rounded for me and had slight sour notes that actually added to the taste of ripe fruits. I used a French press to brew it, following the Hoffman technique and a little improvisation of my own.

TL;DR: Extremely fruity tasting medium-roasted coffee with intense ripe jackfruit notes, not bitter or acidic, slightly sour with a hint of sweetness. Well-rounded coffee, goes extremely well with FP. Won't recommend as a daily driver, rather as a delicacy.",4,1737184326.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.83,False

Our tale starts at roughly 1:10am with the phone ringing. It's an in-house call.

DG = drunk guest, Me = Idk

\-----

Me: ""Guest services""

DG: ""Heyashlkhaelifnewosnc...""\*click\*

Uh, *alright then.*

I wait a few seconds in-case it rings again and sure enough it does! In fact it rings twice and then immediately stops. About 30 seconds later it does it again, a minute later one more ring. And finally after I'd given up and walked away to make more iced coffee it starts ringing for real this time until I answer.

Me: ""*Guest services*""

DG: ""Hiii, do you... could I get an extra blanket""

Me: ""Unfortunately I am out of extra blankets for the night but there should be an extra one in your closet"" (entirely truthful, we have a limited number of extras at the desk and they were gone for the night by the time I came in)

DG: ""We're already using that one. So you're telling me you don't have *any?* If I came down there would one appear?""

Me: ""....no? I don't have any down here at the desk, we have a limited number of extras and they've already been taken for the night""

DG: ""Do you have *anything at all??*"" his tone getting increasingly more annoyed. It's at this point I can hear another man in the background (I'm assuming his SO) say in a sing-songy voice ""Brandonnnn, you're gonna ruin this niiiight\~"". He sounded a lot like Cam from Modern Family if that makes it easier to imagine it lol.

Me: ""I mean... I have bath towels if you really need them"" I won't lie, I wasn't expecting him to actually say yes to the towels, I was hoping it would get him off of my back but nope. He comes down seconds later (shockingly quick I might add).

His eyes are red and he seems.... *off*. I ask him how many towels does he think he might want and he said 4 in a snotty tone. I go ahead and grab 4 but as I'm walking to the back I hear him say something about ""hospitality"" but that's all.

I hand over the towels and he of course demands a managers card to which I happily give him. He then asks for a pen and demands my name to which I say no, you are not getting my name. He writes down the time, the date (he asked me if it's ""18"" and it took me a second to realize me meant the 18th of January"", the address of the property (which is already on the card I might add) and says, ""Sooo, you're really not going to give me your name?"" - Lol, ***no***. You don't need it bud, they'll know it was me without you knowing who I am.

He takes the towel and as he's stepping into the elevator across the lobby he says something to me about how he ""went to college for hospitality"" to which I called back with;

Even though her exposed waist and cleavage told a story of their own, her nipples barely hidden and did slip out every few seconds.

Or Andhadhun, When Simi had to test if Akash was really blind she came to his house to investigate and while he was making coffee, she pulled out her massive breasts in the kitchen to see what visible reaction he would have or maybe down in his pants?

As a young 22 year old, I was excited to be an intern after college at a resort in Andaman. It was the lean season and my friend's father owned the resort. He practically made me incharge of most things, considering their lack of funds to manage it. 

Despite the weak pay, I loved my job. I did it with passion and sincerity. It was a rainy night as usual and I was tallying the accounts in the cafe. We had one or two people in the resort, sitting at the cafe, sipping coffee when Miss/ Mrs. ______ , one of the most famous actresses in town, a siren and a sweetheart walks in. She was dripping in rain and was on vacation to heal herself after a string of flops and a divorce. She was looking to heal herself and have some fun too, being lonely for quite a while now. 

And here starts a hot game that takes us around the island. Your character could ask me to be your tour guide- take you to caves, take you on boat rides, swim together in the beach and go on cafe dates.

I moved across the ocean to NY, with the dream of securing my financial future, building a solid social network I would cherish for life and having experiences I've not had before a gay man. I was told it takes around 2 years to settle in and find you people, I'm coming to 3 years here, and so far, only my financial goals are being met, which is concerning to me.

I am truly thankful for a lot of things in NY, but I'm finding the lack of a network and support, and intimate relationships a real bother for me especially as I am getting older. Many times over the past few weeks I've debated whether I should pull the plug here and start over elsewhere, or give this place once last shot. As much as I want to give NY another shot, I'm also scratching my head in terms of what more I can even do, and now having spoken to dozens of people in NY facing very similar issues, I'm wondering if its time for an exit plan. I can hand on heart say I have done, and continue to do, as much as I can to drive things e.g. reaching out, offering plans / dates, inviting people etc, but it all just seems to backfire / not be appreciated here (in general I mean, I know a few gems).

This topic comes from having worked with a gay coach and shown him messages and conversations and other things I'm doing to try and connect, and him being completely baffled why people are not being more receptive. We came to the conclusion that the general issue I find here is people lack time, are stressed all the time (myself included, which is now showing in my blood pressure, but when I leave I'm fine), travelling and there is this 'dog eats dog' culture that has become so apparent to me here. Everyone is trying to hustle and push through, and this is trickling down into connections in several ways. There is a lack of follow through therefore, not because people are ill intentioned, but simply have no time, but then you are always left hunting and/or feeling neglected, especially as a single immigrant. When I think about what I would want in a long term partner, none of these qualities are things I want, even for myself as a person. When I get to know more people closely, I also find a lot of people are depressed, on drugs to cope and other things, and this is just very concerning to me, as this is not who I want to be at 40.

More specifically:

Sex. All the sex I've had in NY has by far been the worst and most unsatisfactory sex in my life. The best experiences were with visiting men or when I went abroad. They have EQ problems, in their head most of the time, or it feels very transactional and performative etc. Honestly, I am loosing hope for a partner/bf, but to not even able to have satisfying sex as a gay man, is just not good imo.

Immigrant vs US native. Several people I know were 'included into' groups when they moved here and are invited to house parties, and built up their network that way, with more and more invitations coming from those connections. I have yet to be invited to a house party, so I'm still very much on the outside, and have no clue how to break in. All the people who were able to 'break in' typically are already from the US and have friends / connections and then when they moved state were able to find support. I've tried my hardest to connect with other immigrants who made the same move as me, others in the same industry as me, others who basically have some overlap with me, but none of those connections ever led to anything (infact, more than half didn't even lead to a coffee/in person meeting).

Dating. It feels like anyone who even remotely keeps fit (and yes this is a criteria for me as this is important for attraction for me and is something I offer) is in an open relationship or partnered or only wants to hookup or visiting. I have struggled to find anyone actually single who is looking to date and keeps fit, which sounds insane because this is NY, but its true (assuming you also don't want a massive age gap). So while there are many people here, the options are actually terrible imo. I also want to add that also someone open to dating a POC and immigrant, which is even harder, because a lot of US folk are not very worldly or simply don't want to date a POC. Hence I literally have no dating/romantic life: the concept of 'be who you want to date' also requires 'you' to be available in the market.

Meeting people out (bars/clubs/parties etc). Depending on where you go, I can usually always find someone, have a fun convo or night, but thats all it ever is. Maybe you see then 6 months later. Maybe not. The constant putting yourself out there, for immediate gratification, that never leads to anything longer term or consistent, bothers me. I just feel like a meat piece all the time now when I go out and its becoming too much. What saddened me even more is when I travel to non-US places, those guys do hookup with me, but keep in touch, and want to get to know me, but where I live people can't be asked. FWIW LGBT sports, gyms, etc all also never led to any real connections, acquaintances at best.

All of these things make me wonder, am I just here to continue to build my finances, and if so, is it even worth it to stay in NY anymore?

This is not a cry for help post, but a genuine desire to understand if there is any stone I can still unturn here to make my NY life and experiences better, as I'm honestly loosing hope with this city.",3,1737183086.0,nycgaybros,2,1.0,False

However, if my smoothies go more towards the “fun” side (nut butter, chocolate, vanilla, ice cream) which I sometimes do make, I get much unhealthier cravings.

He failed, failed on purpose, even though there's a chance of being victor, he rejected somehow, The Detective was confused to see defendant fade away his words which's supposed to be suitable for proofs. The judge was delighted, and the capitalist was in the same confusion as The Detective. The Detective, his failure, which could have been a success had deceased, murdered by the man whose hope was destroyed by himself.

Samuf Turrison, a gentleman in his thirties always tends to meet some problems on the road to the next day. He struggled to overcome the night, feared by ultra-realistic nightmares, annoyed by his two sons complaining about the father's despair for sitting tight at home. He's a rejected man by society, family and eventually himself, an adult like him phased out, to be a fake philosopher reading a few books in his locked room. It is touchable, touched by his old smoky fingers, his bias on such seemed to be a little bit overaching in the wake of his miserable life happened a week ago.

The two capitalists, let's call them Viktor and Erik. Viktor was a lawyer as a college student, later he succeeded to the property mentioned in his father's testamentary. Erik, Viktor's brother, majored in finance following his father's will, recruited by him owing to Erik's mind for business, with him harnessing all advantageous elements to run the company, its boom came frequently, flourishing almost every month. Viktor soon arrived the destination from capital, he received the message sent by the judge which was shocked to find out Erik murdered when his bodyguards reported to him. The victim was found, but the murderer, no signs.

A week ago, Erik found murdered outside his lawn. His head was smashed by a shovel, barely to identify, along with that, a woman, was found shot in bed, six bullet holes on the head, breasts, the abdomen, and the lower. The police examined the bodies, they found the fingerprints indicated to a middle-aged man and the bullets inside the woman identified as a revolver, an old one. The murder took place at midnight, the moment every resident was asleep except the neighbor, who was watching pornographic footages with pants off. The police recorded his words:

""Just when I was watching movies, you know. I heard a man shouting, or two. He's like, yelling out MY LIFE IS FUCKING RUINED! EVEN MY MOST BELOVED ONE DESERTED ME! I'M A MISERABLE CREATURE ABANDONED BY GOD! Oh Jesus, I paused the movie and looked outside, two shadows in chaos, I could see the guy holding something hitting another, even if he's already fallen over without a single twitch. That's a blurry and dark sight. Later, I heard a woman screaming like a witch on fire PLEASE FORGIVE ME! PLEASE IT'S MY FAULT, I'M SO SORRY, I WOULD NOT DO THIS AGAIN! Then there're just shots, six rounds. The noise phased out, the shadow drove away, but I couldn't see his number. Too dark!""

The Detective listened to the tape once again, especially the noisy part uneased the colleagues' emotions. Their pays and promotions are the only dedication to the case. An ordinary murder case closes in the same way, even the victim is a capitalist. The Detective, was told to shut down the radio by others due to the staff were in the nap with dreams to be the only one shelter to settle down, the minutes before wake-up could be delighting. The Detective isn't that type, he's woke, nerve tight as always, leaving other officers an impression of insanity, like a psychopath escaped from an asylum, particularly with a Sherlock Holmes suit on all the year. The Detective went out to the bar, watching the news. The news was reporting a retreat of troops in a third-world country, which is a kind of boredom to him. He ordered a whiskey, enjoying this boredom to fill the blank of his thoughts on the case. He wanted to know the witness, to reach the next level of the murderer, or the conspiracy behind the whole system. A sick soicety needs an insane man to recover, which is an unacceptable truth to the public.

The key was to be found...

A day later, the murderer captured in the basement, the condition absolutely fitted a drunkard: Dim lights, rubbish and bottles on the dirty wet ground, damp walls made a perfect habitat for insects to settle, and rats would hold a party every night to drive someone insane, varieties of liquor bottles randomly dropped on the ground implied the failure kind of lifestyle that the owner insists. The man, without any clothes on lying on the floor with disgusting liquid splashed all around, was holding a beer bottle in his smelly mouth, like a baby sucking a nipple. The two teenagers directed policemen to the secret basement of their father, the cops flashed the man, he just woke up, seeing lights coming to prison him. The police came close, grabbing his arms and legs one by one, and dragged him outside. The man seemed to be fearful, he didn't understand how the police found him. He at first required a miserable decease belongs to a middle-aged style, but he even failed on this. The man saw his sons, glaring at him for the matter, which their mother got killed.

The witness, outside the bar awaiting, as The Detective came out he rushed to him. He told The Detective, the proof was a conspiracy, the tape was recorded by The Detective's colleagues to form a shield of distraction, even the very words he related was prescripted due to the will of cops to seal the truth. The Detective wasn't so surprised, he asked the witness to go into the bar, the witness told him everything about the murder, he saw the whole process, with a footage recorded, yet the vision was dark and blurry, the voice was clear, it was a whole difference from the previous tape, which drew The Detective into constant confusion. The witness knew the murderer well, he clarified that such a irreversible situation would ruin his friend's rest of life, and he wished the murderer would not be found ever, therefore the witness dialed his number to remind the murderer to escape from this corrupted town covered in justice while the opportunity haven't faded away yet. So the chance was given to him, however, he refused to take it and eventually got reported to the police by his sons. Samuf Turrison could have a chance to run away, that's what the witness meant. He currently felt sinful for being witness, he regreted for himself being the assistance factor of Turrison held captive. He was his friend, the only one. But even the only friend, whose will was dedicated to save him, betrayed Samuf Turrison.

The police, knew the witness well, they already held the information of the relationship between him and the murderer. Thus when the case was reported to them, the first thing they did was to interrogate the neighbor, he was scared of them breaking into his door all of a sudden, lips shaking to tell anything he could share, the police stared at him sitting on the chairs with finger crossed, their fine sitting order terrified the neighbor, seemed like the cops installed a camera in his bedroom. Six minutes had passed, the neighbor's phycology defense eventually crashed as one police officer started lighting a cigarette impatiently, indicating that they knew everything from the file, just wait to see the neighbor commit himself a witness, whether he's clear or not. The black box effect on the neighbor had forced himself to be a witness, or an assistant. As a result, the tape considered useless successfully confused The Detective, which made him shocked than being mad.

A communist lawyer came, as one of Turrison's basic human rights, he's allowed to have a lawyer with him. The Detective met him at the door, the lawyer acquired a talk with just Turrison and himself. The Detective left, smoking to empty his mind. He didn't know why his colleagues cheated on him. His character? Motivation? Or even confrontation against the whole system? It's sure The Detective denies its legislation right on the judge's face during the hotel ball dance. The judge remembered that. The lawyer came out, saying Turrison had agreed with the suggestions. The Detective doubted that, he knew Turrison was a tough person. But his acceptance towards a communist seemed to be the key, The Detective thought to himself, he's unsure about it, and blurry about the ideology of Samuf Turrison. He rushed to the door as the communist lawyer went out, The Detective tried talking to him, longing for information hidden between the lawyer and Turrison to be delivered, however, concrete ones weren't related instead of an abstract motto created by the lawyer seconds ago: ""Everything involved in politics is a demon in disguise, even the most ideal purists become degenerates under the impact of the system.""

The key was broken the next day.

The lawyer was never to be found. This gave The Detective the faith to unveil the black box covering the masked men, various masks, with smiling, weeping, yelling, varieties of emotions were the reflex of the system that already hid its true matter. He suspected the lawyer was killed, but where? He couldn't just imagine a destination that's fit for his death. What if he's not killed? His identity could have him done that way, however, the system runs democracy to determine the fate of the lawyer: Deserted. That's not quite right as well, the lawyer could have related it to him, since it's the invitation from The Detective. What if he's forced to keep the secret? Considering the possibility of him escorted by a team of system protectors sent by the judge. There's one thing to be sure: The lawyer wasn't bribed. He's a true communist, and officials in the system are true anti-communists. The police are just slaves modified to be Chinese figure.

The judgment day was close. In the cell, Samuf Turrison counting his days to be defeated in the court, and finally on the road to jail. The whole society seemed to be his enemy in the blink of an eye. His companions failed him over and over. By stupidity, by ideology, or by powerless figure. The Detective was the third one, his disproved mentality retained vulnerability, making it nearly impossible to take a confrontation against even the first level of the system. His motions were perfectly handled by allies, which already looked at him with high noses. He didn't want to admit this is a war he never wins, even a small campaign could take him down in one bit. Facing the system without a systematic group would be regarded a fiasco in one's rest of the life, deserted by the society. The Detective made the decision, he required a lawyer seat in the court, as Turrison's. The judge agreed, he knew The Detective, his will to defend Turrison was a plot for the judge, a naive plot but no way back. They two were meant to acquire a destined failure in the very end.

Samuf Turrison, glanced at The Detective, they did this for ten minutes and Turrison talked, ""Your courge has accepted the fate of career fiasco, your life has accepted the fate of living in the desert."" The Detective replied, ""My sacrifice has overcome the misery. My brand new life starts from the judgment."" The Detective asked Turrison to make a promise, a promise to fully defend himself in the court. Turrison accepted to his demand, but as soon as he left, he took the words back in the heart.

The judgment began, the jury sat loose, they regarded the trial a comedy. However, the witness' nerves were tight, he knew the destiny coming to his friend, still feared to see it come. He closed the eyes, but soon open up unwillingly, next to him were Turrison's two sons, they view the trial as NAZIS being sentenced to death or life in prison. Samuf Turrison saw all of this, and bizarre confidence planted inside of The Detective. The captalist, whose emotion presented on his face seemed unwilling but somehow embracing a sense of responsibility, Turrison considered himself a tool right after he sat beside The Detective. Their duties were corrupted by politics, and the judge took it as a talk show with a sip of coffee, watching clowns playing around with stupidity in his realm of dictatorship. At this moment, Turrison remembered the words related by the lawyer in the chamber:

""Once politics, all time politics.""

Samuf Turrison, The Detective, The judge, Viktor himself, came to their seats. They all understood the trial was pointless, even though the defendant had numerous proofs to overwhelm Viktor. The destiny remained unchanged. Whether being victor or being loser, its significance had been washed away by the whole system. Turrison knew that, so did The Detective. He wished to perish in a glorious way, as a marker that he at least held a lonely demonstration towards it. But the fate itself, loves to be tricky.",0,1737182734.0,writers,3,0.5,False

I’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling to break into an entry-level position in research, disaster  or emergency-related fields for about a year now, and I could really use some advice. I've broadened my job search to literally anything that would eventually help me get into these types of roles at this point. Despite my best efforts—cold emailing, coffee chats, networking, and applying to hundreds of roles—I’ve been met with rejection after rejection for a whole year. Often, the feedback I receive is that candidates with graduate degrees or more experience were preferred. It’s frustrating, especially as the job market feels incredibly competitive.

I’ve done my best to keep pushing through, but I’m feeling pretty exhausted. I can't keep working part-time as I need to be able to afford to live and even getting my part-time job was so difficult I don't even know if I would be able to manage getting a second. So, I’m really hoping to find something full-time that aligns with my interests and skills, but at this point, I’m feeling stuck.

If anyone has any advice on how to stand out as a newer candidate in these fields, strategies I might be missing, or personal experiences to share, I would be so grateful. I’m open to any thoughts, tips, or even offers of encouragement.

The second thing I do is protect him of course. From distractions, from fake friends, anyone that might steal a second of his attention away.

Third I never let him doubt my love. If he wants space I give it to him. Exactly enough but I’m always there one step behind him. I can’t abandon him he needs me to protect him. So nothing can harm him.

No that can’t due I will be there and make sure no one hurts him.

A few days later he goes to a coffee shop. 
Then there she is they meet up outside and head in. They get in an awkward shuffle where he ends up holding the door for her. This gets me seething and I storm off

1i41ojt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i41ojt,My Take on Protein Bars: The Whole Truth vs. SuperYou vs. As-It-Is vs. MuscleBlaze,"Hey fitness enthusiasts! 👋
I recently tried out protein bars from a few popular brands: The Whole Truth, SuperYou, As-It-Is, and MuscleBlaze. Here's my take on each of them based on taste, ingredients, and protein content.

1. The Whole Truth 🥇
* Protein per bar: ~12g
* Taste: Absolutely loved it! Clean, natural, and delicious.
* Ingredients: No hidden ingredients, no artificial sweeteners—just transparency and quality.
* Verdict: My top pick! Tastes great and feels guilt-free.

2. SuperYou 🥈
* Protein per bar: ~10g
* Taste: Tastes good, but not as clean as The Whole Truth.
* Ingredients: A few hidden additives, which might not be the best for long-term consumption.
* Verdict: A decent alternative but lacks the ""clean"" vibe.

3. As-It-Is 🥉
* Protein per bar: ~20g
* Taste: Meh—didn't enjoy it much. It’s on the sweeter side, but not overly so.
* Ingredients: Clean with no hidden surprises.
* Verdict: High on protein, but I wouldn’t pick it for the taste.

4. MuscleBlaze ❌
* Protein per bar: ~20g
* Taste: Least favorite. Super sweet (10g sugar per bar!), and I had to gulp down 300–400ml of water to finish it.
* Ingredients: Overly sugary and just not worth it.
* Verdict: Wouldn’t recommend. Too sweet and not satisfying.

TL;DR:
* Winner: The Whole Truth—perfect blend of taste and clean ingredients.
* Runner-Up: SuperYou—good taste but not as clean.
* As-It-Is: Clean but not tasty.
* MuscleBlaze: Too sugary and not enjoyable.
What are your go-to protein bars? Let me know if you’ve found something amazing! 💪

Also I am looking for some protein supplement that are lactose free, initially I was using Muscletech Performance Series Nitrotech Ripped Whey Protein had good results but after it was over I gave a try to ONN bought from HealthKart but started seeing acne on my back(has anyone experienced it?, is is common?) Thinking of trying plant based protein, what are the shortcomings if anyone of you has used such products?

You could see the sunrise surfacing before faintly touching the snowy parts of a giant boulder, the lake below casting off an ethereal glow as the reflection came slowly came into view, the trees here are green and lush, the smell of firewood and pine fills the air, sky bluer then I've ever seen it before.

That type of beauty is hard to come by. Although I'm only now accepting the past for what it is, for what you did to me, for what I did to you. You truly were and are a gem, Aidan. I hate feeling this sort of way knowing damn well I was too cowardly to even speak up let alone look at you directly. But what can I say? Your light shines too brightly and it's hard to stare long enough before I tire my eyes out. I do wish things had been differently. That I had stayed on the path I had wanted with God and you. I was... Emotionally immature and stunted.

But I do know what we had, once, was and is real. I did truly loved you for you, for how strange and obscure, lame and dorky too, persistent and dedicated, and most importantly for how loving and kind you were. I forgive you. Which isn't really my kinda thing, mind you, it took me how long to do so considering the blows you did to me were pretty lethal. Were pretty messed up.

Yet, I carry on this love in my pocket. Never seem to been able to remove it entirely. Little flakes of dust here and there to remind me of your presence. And my God, did you have a presence. You remind me of what vanilla and pine smells like. Kind of creepy but I digress aha. Your two front teeth were always too straight, giving off a bunny appearance, always found that interesting and endearing.

You were and are a bit of a brat though, pretentious and cared too much about what other people thought of you though. Could tolerate and come to love the first two, but never cared too much for the latter. Live for yourself and stop living and doing what other people think is right, do what is right to You even if it makes no sense to other people, 90 percent of the people here are NPCS anyways so their opinion doesn't matter anyways. I think you deserve better then the girl you're with though, you know what I mean.. Yeah. Kind of self explanatory. Not saying I'm any better, I've got a lot of set backs personality wise and just looks wise. Kidding, I love and accept those things about myself. Although I could definitely do something about my weight that I can admit. Whoever you end up with who it is, if it's her then I can respect that. More like judging. I can't help it. There's something off that person.

Regardless, best of luck. I love you and wish you the best. May the next time we meet, if that's ever to happen, that I'm in a much better space in my life. Preferably a tighter waist and bigger arms ahahah. Lord, may these burns go away so I can actually work on that. But yeah. Good luck Chuck and if you're ever in my neck of the woods again, come say Hi Aidan. It would be nice to sit down and grab a cup of coffee someday. Who knows.. Maybe we can start over again and start off as friends. I see you as an endearing, eldritch horror type of one already aha.

After a falling out with my parents in December, I moved out, and he distanced himself, saying I should focus on fixing things with my family. Now that my life is stable, the heartbreak is hitting hard. He’s showing up in my dreams, I’ve been avoiding sleep, and it’s taking a toll on me emotionally. I want closure, but I’m unsure if it’s fair to ask for it or if I  just move on. 

I (21F) don’t usually do relationships. I had a friend from my college friend group (22M) who I’d known for about a year and a half. He asked me out in February, but I said no. We stayed friends, but by September, something shifted for me, and I started seeing him in a different light. I asked him out, and we decided to explore things together.

It wasn’t a defined relationship—it was more of a situationship. We were into each other and spent time together, but it felt a little rocky as we tried to figure out if we were on the same page. For me, relationships are uncharted territory, and I was still learning what I wanted. He, on the other hand, seemed to be looking for something serious right away.

Despite the uncertainties, we shared some really special moments. We’d go on drives, visit lakes, and watch the autumn leaves (which I love). In the winter, he took me to see the lights. He learned my favorite songs on the guitar, we visited bookstores, and we’d grab coffee together. He never even had to ask how I took my coffee—he just knew. He’s a private person, and I knew that from being friends first. But during this time, he let me into his life, showing me the deeper parts of who he is. That made it even more special and now makes it even harder. I’d never felt as comfortable with anyone as I did with him. I could cry in front of him or fall asleep in his car without feeling self-conscious. He made me feel safe and like I could share my problems without being a burden.

Then, in December, I had a major falling out with my parents. It’s a long story, but they found out about him, and I ended up moving out of my family home. When I told him, he to not contact him until I sorted things out with my family. At the time, I was so consumed with everything else going on that I didn’t give much thought to his reaction. Thankfully, I had an amazing support system outside of him—friends who showed up for me and made sure I wasn’t alone—so I was able to get through that time without depending on him too much.

For the past month, we’ve had minimal contact. Since we share a friend group, we’ve checked in on each other indirectly, but he’s become very distant. Now that my life has stabilized, the heartbreak is really hitting me. We never defined what we were, so it doesn’t feel like a breakup, but it still hurts deeply. We didn’t have a proper conversation about what happened, and while his silence feels like an answer, I know I need closure.

What’s making it worse is how much this is affecting me emotionally and physically. He’s been showing up in my dreams lately, and it’s something that didn’t happen before when he was still in my life. Now I wake up in a bad mood, and it’s making it harder to sleep. I’ve started avoiding sleep just to avoid dreaming about him, but it’s taking a toll on me.

I feel like I need to sit down with him, express how I feel, and let him know that for my own healing, I’ll need to block him for a while. It’s not out of anger—I just need space to move on because this hurts so much. Our mutual friends have mentioned he’s struggling too, but I’m stuck on how to move forward.

How do I approach this? What’s the best way to handle the situation? Do I reach out to have this conversation and explain how I feel, or would it be better to focus on moving forward without it? I’d really appreciate any advice from others who’ve been through something similar.",1,1737182064.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1i41hyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchreckNet/comments/1i41hyq/that_time_i_went_to_a_dead_mans_party_in_denver/,That time I went to a Dead Man's Party in Denver,"So no shit there I was, minding my own business, smoking a cigarette outside of the local Denny's at afters. It's what we LARPers call it when we get together at a restaurant after we're done pretending to be petty vampires to each other and can go back to being petty to each other. Anyways, out of nowhere I hear

""Yeah, from what I hear him and his iron pipe is back in town, and from what I hear he has ***seriously*** pissed off the vampires. It's why we're going back to hard carding events at the door.""

I looked up to see a twink wearing a cutoff with a dog collar around his throat talking to someone with a purple tail coming out of their butt. I had found the furrys.

Dear reader, this... this was a perfect moment of irony for me. A true trifecta of the shit storm that had subsumed my life. Because I knew the moment they mentioned an iron pipe exactly who they were talking about. Because the same iron pipe had been used to threaten one of the LARP storytellers inside, and they had called me to that Denny's to explain who this fuck was.

""You're talking about >!Myx!<, aren't you?"" I asked with a smile behind my lips. The look of sheer terror on the boy's face knowing that he was caught dead to rights talking Night Side news.

That fucking Unseelie hyena pooka.

If you don't know who this piece of shit is, be lucky. He's Anathema for a reason. I know because I pointed out the spelling error in the edict and they still didn't correct it before signing it.

Now... why did I tell this story? Because to the baby bats out there this is gonna be kinda funny weird. But to the Elders, they're popping popcorn because I feel like dropping data about that one time I went to a Dead Man's Party in Denver.

So there I was in an Uber in a complete whiteout blizzard. Apparently from what I had heard was that Wendigo was on the hunt because of the Grand Elysium happening. So many fangs were in town. How do I know this? Because I was part of a political entourage attending. So anyways after giving this absolutely amazing 200% tip to an Uber driver telling me about Wendigos, I was happy to arrive at the first event at some historical house of whatever.

I had literally not a clue what was going on or the significance of said event. Just that some... I dunno if she would be a really really hot Gangrel? Or a Torriewhore? Catgirl is what I'm saying. Cat from the dumpster. Anyways this catgirl and her harem of barely legal catgirls was throwing a big big party in Denver because local tensions were spilling over into the mortal world in the social media atmosphere. Apparently some pretty boy from the Southwest territories was milking that whole ""I'm a vampire"" for social media clout and fame and the local mega-Prince didn't really like that muscling in on his vampire themed gothic charity. Tensions were running high, with accusations coming from a local cabal in New Orleans that pretty boy on TikTok had cast a spell over the city causing an noted uptick in violence threatening the kine.

I... in all my years of storytelling Black Dog games, couldn't make this shit up people.

So anyways, where was I? Oh yeah. Denver. Kinda cool place. Kinda not. Like, stood in line at the 7-11 and suddenly feel reality shift one degree to the left. It stayed that way for a good thirty seconds before snapping back. I looked at the clerk and asked if they had felt something (because also hey Colorado is rec weed), and they just shrugged and said ""It happens from time to time.""

And there I was, pulling up to what looked like the Addams Family mansion in the middle of Denver. In the middle of a blizzard. Alone. Why am I alone? Because the Ventrue Primogen was too broke to afford to party for all three nights, so she only bought tickets for the big gala. And the cheap bitch made sure to tell me that I shouldn't comment on how little money she had, because they'd judge.

Anyways, alone. Blizzard. About to walk into one of the biggest gathering this side of Rice's October get together, armed with only the vague knowledge I have gleamed out of Black Dog Game Factory books.

Oh, and if you haven't been paying attention, I also have ***a pulse***.

Seriously, these vampire roleplaying games? Might as well be a field guide to all of you. They've got you all laid out and pinned. Topless jezebel was snake dancing for everyone's entertainment was probably a fan of Typhon, a very deeply Italian man was walking around asking if they wouldn't mind having their ~~souls stolen~~ pictures taken? Giovanni.

Then there was Captain Hook.

I still, to this day, cannot explain why Captain Hook was there. But he was. Dressed to the gills like a pirate, eyepatch, parrot, and hook.

This was explicitly a vampire themed party... but there was Captain Hook. I actually thought that fish Melks were only a thing in the table tops. Nope. Captain fucking Hook.

Anyways, why was I there? The local Tzim Baron apparently wanted to start forming some official political ties to the greater community. Black Dog may say we're a jewel... we're not. More a bunch of independents who like to be left the fuck alone. We show up for Max's big Vampire Queen Ball, then all fuck off to our own holes. But that was hoping to change. Apparently the Baron's sire was one of the few old skool Tzims that are like... deeply respected among you fangs. So she was flying in from NOLA and her backing would go far in attempting to establish his reign of the city among the other kine? I dunno. Just find sire, make nice.

Welp, from what I gathered just hearing the chatter among the crowd, there had been a delay and she wouldn't be in attendance that night. Boo hoo. Time to just... as the mortals say... vibe. Wander out onto the porch of this mansion for a smoke, and there I meet Texas.

Texas is loud.

There, sequestered a bit in the shadows are two absolutely lovely ladies giggling to each other about the affairs going on. One apparently ran her occult shop (so a witch... Bruja) and the other I just don't ask questions when shadows do those kinds of things. We chit chatted a bit about normal stuff and what movies we were currently digging when suddenly I get grabbed and dragged off. Not in the bad way. Just apparently one of the locals had heard I was an emissary and was trying to look important by introducing me. 

Kinda just chilling in a line(?) but its just a big crowd surrounding the local Seneschal. And lo and behold what do I hear in a very distinct voice, ""<<Home City>>? I fucking hate that city."" come from the Seneschal. Cat... boy? No, I can't say that because like catboys are actually sexy. This guy looked like what the cat drags in and presents to you. 

Yes. I can be petty too. 

Anyways dumb fuck provided a very... strained... introduction 30 seconds later after realizing who he had just said what in front of, quickly attempting desperately to backpedal when he realized not just who, but *what*, he had just insulted.

Also if you're wondering whatever could cause the fates to conspire to splash Denver's dirty biz across everyone's Book of Faces... don't fuck with the fae kids. 

So wandering away from Prick McDicklick, I regrouped up with TX with some good news and some bad news. Good news: My target had arrived, checked into her hotel, and was currently partying at a local bondage club. Bad news: My phone had 5% juice left. It was either go with strange vampires to an unknown bondage club in a city I didn't know, or be able to call an Uber to get to my hotel safely. Choices.

So I took it as a sign from Bacchus that I should probably go to bed and sleep off the 14 shots of vodka and four cups of coffee coursing through my system at the time. Partying like a rock star isn't the problem. It's recovering like one.

So yeah, I'm realizing that this story is getting really long in the tooth (HA!) and I probably should split this up into more bite sized chunks. Stay tuned if I feel like talking about the most mediocre Blood Feast I've ever attended, or what the actual gala was like. 

Also, baby bats... remember: VAMPIRES DO NOT EXIST.

But sometimes you just can't make this shit up.

Thanks to modern technology, vending machines can now offer features like automatic discounts, product bundling, and even dynamic pricing. These innovations not only make the shopping experience more appealing to customers but also help operators increase their sales and efficiency.

# 1. Automatic Discounts: A Win-Win for Customers and Operators

One of the most exciting features in today's vending machines is the ability to automatically apply discounts. For example, customers may receive a discount if they buy certain products during off-peak hours or when stock levels are high. This type of automation allows customers to feel like they’re getting a good deal without the need for manual intervention, and it helps vendors reduce excess stock.

**Example:**  
Imagine a vending machine that offers a 10% discount on a particular snack after 7 PM when foot traffic is lower. This can encourage customers who might otherwise have skipped the machine to make a purchase, especially if they feel they’re getting a bargain.

**Benefit:**  
Automatic discounts can drive sales during typically slow periods and optimize the inventory management process, ultimately leading to higher profits.

# 2. Product Bundling: Increase Sales by Encouraging Bulk Purchases

Vending machines that offer product bundling can significantly increase the amount spent per transaction. This strategy involves offering related items together at a discounted price compared to buying them individually. It’s an effective way to increase the average value of each customer transaction.

**Example:**  
A vending machine could offer a ""snack and drink bundle"" for $3 when purchased together, while each item would normally cost $2 individually. This encourages customers to purchase more than they might have originally intended.

**Benefit:**  
By encouraging customers to buy more items, bundling boosts sales, while also enhancing customer satisfaction by offering convenience and perceived value.

# 3. Dynamic Pricing: Increase Profitability Based on Demand

Dynamic pricing, where the cost of products changes based on factors like time of day, stock levels, or even demand, is another great feature in modern vending machines. For instance, a vending machine might increase prices slightly during peak hours or weekends, while offering discounts during quieter times.

**Example:**  
Imagine a coffee vending machine in an office building. During the morning rush (7 AM to 9 AM), the price for a coffee could increase by 10%, while in the late afternoon (3 PM to 5 PM), the price could drop by 5% to attract customers seeking an afternoon pick-me-up.

**Benefit:**  
Dynamic pricing helps operators maximize profits during high-demand periods and encourage purchases during low-demand times, leading to a more balanced and profitable operation.

# Why Customers Need These Features

From a customer’s perspective, the ability to get discounts, bundled deals, and dynamic pricing adds value and convenience. Many customers appreciate the flexibility to shop at any time and the chance to get a better deal depending on when they purchase. Whether it's saving a little money on snacks during off-hours or bundling a drink with a snack at a discounted rate, these features make the vending machine experience more rewarding.

# How These Features Help Increase Sales

For vending machine operators, these features can lead to an increase in both the number of transactions and the average sale amount. Here’s how:

* **Automatic discounts** can incentivize customers to buy at specific times, increasing traffic during quieter periods.
* **Bundling** encourages customers to buy more items, raising the total transaction value.
* **Dynamic pricing** ensures the vending machine is maximizing profits during times of high demand, while maintaining competitive pricing during slower periods.

All of these factors contribute to a smoother, more profitable vending machine operation. In fact, operators could see a sales increase of up to 20-30% by implementing these features, depending on location and customer behavior.

# Conclusion

The future of vending machines is evolving, and with features like automatic discounts, product bundling, and dynamic pricing, operators can significantly boost sales while offering customers more value and convenience. As technology continues to advance, we can expect these vending machines to become even smarter, further enhancing the shopping experience and optimizing profitability.",1,1737181312.0,VendingB2B,0,1.0,False

It was mine and my husbands day off yesterday together and we said we wanted to go to one of our favourite coffee shops in town. So we did. We went with our dog. I popped our amazing coffee and food on insta story. An hour later she rang my husband saying ‘where did you go?’ ‘That looked so nice, we should go when I’m off and your off’ not including me once again. My husband told me and I said well that’s not fair, it’s our place and it’s not her place she always wants to do the exact same things we do but without me. 

He said ‘she’s my mum you should go and do stuff with your mum it’s not my fault you don’t spend time with her’ which I do sometimes but my mum is difficult sometimes and I struggle with her, which is bad on my side but I do try to meet up with her atleast once a week if not more. 

But then I said she literally always does it his and I think it’s really weird that she always wants to go to the same places we go but without me?
