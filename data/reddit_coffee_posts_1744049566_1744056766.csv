We’re just going to meet at a coffee shop before work (at like 11) and theres a flower shop nearby that I could drive to beforehand. Would it be a good idea to stop by and get a rose before the date or wait a bit for a future date/more traditionally romantic one like a dinner? Or do both?

I was diagnosed with mild chronic gastritis this past winter, but I started experiencing awful symptoms back in Summer 2024 — constant nausea, stomach pain, HORRIBLE brain fog, vision issues, and alternating between diarrhea and constipation.

Thankfully, I’ve come a long way. I focused on healing my stomach with supplements and slowly weaned off my PPI (which honestly felt like it was making things worse). Now I can eat almost anything — acidic foods, fried foods, etc. — with little to no issues.

But coffee? That’s still a total no-go.
I’m devastated because I used to love coffee, and now even a sip wrecks me. A couple of days ago I had three sips of a latte and have been extremely sick since — nausea, intense acid reflux, debilitating brain fog. I’ve barely been able to get out of bed. This happens every single time, even with decaf.

It’s so frustrating because I can tolerate foods that you’d think would be worse than coffee. Has anyone else dealt with this? Does it ever get better? I really miss my coffee routine and would love to hear from others going through the same thing.",1,1744056373.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

God forbid someone tries to share their opinion, and valid criticism of a popular series. Don't come for me, I'll explain. Just know I don't hate the series, some things just stick out and break my immersion repeatedly. Some things are good, some things are bad, both can be discussed, calm down.

Just FYI, I'm around Chapter 480 now, and I'll omit a lot of other grievances that I'm hoping have explanations or get better with time.

I'll start with one issue before I lose the ones with short attention spans. Sunny is from the slums, the outskirts, the guy doesn't know what popcorn is, spends his entire savings on one cup of coffee, has never seen a Book in his life, (and more!!), AND YET, bro is educated (went to school, can read and write), has watched movies, read webtoons and ""stories"", can recognize propaganda, understands how to navigate the world, ""communicator"", social media, etc. Oh, he can also write articles that gets him millions, while at first his teacher says they weren't perfect, later we have an author who praises him for how great his articles are, revolutionary even! I'm paraphrasing, relax.

Before anyone jumps and tells me the chapter said he hadn't seen a physical book, and normal people used Terminals, are you saying these slums children had that kind of technology to learn how to read and write? Need I explain more?

My point here? Constant breaking of immersion. If it was a side character, fine, but the MC? And the whole time we keep getting these lines of him having been an outskirt kid, so he doesn't know this simple thing or that clearly known thing, but somehow he is shown to know more complicated things, things like intricate and specific knowledge and history of the Nightmares/Spell/System, and yes this is prior to him reading in the library. It might not bother you, but it takes a reader out of the story constantly, questioning the validity of the MC's past, the very driving force behind what makes him who he is.

Oh, remember that one article he wrote about the first nightmare? now imagine this, over 100 Sleepers survive the first nightmare, some of which had been there for YEARS, far longer than Sunny. And yet, somehow, only he decides to make millions by writing articles? You might say we don't know if they had, but would the government, who mind you barely feeds these outskirt children, give millions to EVERY single Sleeper who writes about the Nightmares? Would the government, the greedy, slimy, money-hungry folks give that much for repeated information? Who forced them to offer that much doe to a kid with no knowledge of how much one article goes for? And to do it on repeat? Wasn't this a post-apocalyptic, sad little world? Don't get me started on the fact there are all kinds of entertainments, and famous people, yet no one turns to these outskirt children who have never seen a book in their lives. (I know we have that IRL too, but no simple Sleeper can make millions out of an article in our world, where are the other outskirt survivors beside Sunny and Jet?)

I'll end this here with one last point though. I'm not sure if this changes later on, and I've kind of forgotten some things from the beginning of the series, but Sunny was supposed to be this scheming, merciless liar BECAUSE he was from the outskirts, right? Do we ever actually see a flashback of any situation from that time to ""show"" us how that happened, or we just going to assume ""it was bad""? Like how we eventually get a flashback(s) for Gray from TBATE.

I like a lot of Nightmare world building stuff, love Kai and Effie, even the interesting plot around Nephis about the three clan leaders she needs to kill, but Sunny and the real world often seem like that one annoying tag along, but they don't know it and always jump at you and attach themselves to your hip. Except Sunny is an edge lord who tries to be funny, but isn't, and a lot of his decisions and inner monologue are just plain bad.

It now hurts to lie, so all this was immutably true. Don't get me started on that flaw that stopped being funny or an issue in the first nightmare.

Should i adjust something else than lower the ratio to get rid of the weak coffee? i don't think its underextracted since when i increase time it doesnt taste as good.

Long backstory for context....There is an important, word class conference/event that happens in my city for my field of work. It happens Thursday-Sunday. Last year I (30/M) did not attend at all because my wife's family was visiting us. I made it clear that this year I wanted to attend as much as I could. Maybe two months ago she scheduled a surgery to have a bone biopsy on her foot. It has been causing her some pain on and off for years. The surgery was scheduled for Friday and we both understood it would be a very minor procedure (although invovling general anesthesia). About two weeks before, I expressed to her that on Friday night there would be a famous doctor giving a talk at the conference. This person is pretty old, rarely if ever speaks in public, and this very well may have been the first and last opportunity to hear him speak. We both agreed that if she was feeling okay after the surgery that I could go out and hopefully catch the last half hour of the talk. I spent all day with her at the hospital due to a lot of delays and waiting. Everything went well, she said she was in no pain and did not (and has not) needed to take any narcotics for pain. We went home, I helped her with dinner, bought her favorite candy, wathced some TV with her. When I knew she was settled and safe, I asked her so many times how she was feeling -- was she in pain? Was she okay? Did she need anything? Was she okay if I went out? I told her I would absolutely not go if she didn't want or was in pain. She assured me so many times that it was fine and I believed her. I told her to please text me if she needed anything and I would come home immediately. I went out at 8:30 and heard the last half hour of the talk. I talked to many of my collegues that I rarely see and did some networking (no drinking) and got back pretty late at around 12am. She was still awake and I checked on her and everything was fine. Saturday, I was out for around 3 hours because I was paid to give a short talk at said conference. Saturday evening, I picked up dinner for us and we went to a metal concert which she had been wanting to go to. She was completely fine and happy, although had to walk with crutches. She was eating and drinking (multiple drinks) and did not seem like she was in any pain. Again, I was constantly asking her how she was doing and feeling. I did everything for her that I thought was appropriate -- dropped her off, parked, bought her merch, drinks, food, etc. Saturday night after we got back we went to bed. She knew there was a lot of fun happening at the conference. She asked why I was not going out, I said because I was sleepy. She insisted that it was a once a year event and that I should go out and see my collegues. Again, I asked if she was okay, if she needed anything, etc. I went out around 12:30am and got home around 5am (again, zero drinking). On Sunday I got food for us and spent the entire day with her, watching her favorite TV show, getting her food, helping her with things. I went out at 5pm to catch 1 hour of the conference farewell, and then went to the grocery store for us. I got home around 8pm, cleaned the kitchen, prepared coffee for the next day, then went to check on her. She blew up at me. She kept asking me why the f\*\*\* I would leave her when she just had a surgery, saying what a sh\*\*ty person I am for barely being home with her the two days after the surgery. She asked why I did not text her while I was out (I did text her when I got there and when I was leaving) to check on her. Why was I not thinking about her? She told me it seemed like I do not give a sh\*\* about her at all or her surgery or her pain. She said I am minimizing what she is going through. She was also upset that the night before the surgery when she was scared that she was offended that I was trying to make her feel less scared by mentioned other people who have had surgeries. She said I should have listened to her instead of ""telling her how she should feel."" And she also said that when we were waiting in pre-op that she was scared but that she didn't feel comfortable telling me any of the things she was thinking... even though I did ask her so many times. She said that I wasn't asking her the right questions and said ""what if a therapist asked you (xyz)?""... but I am not a therapist. She also asked me why the f\*\*\* I was texting during her show. I am just so confused and devastated at the moment. If I would have known she was in pain I would have never left the house. I feel like the worst person in the world and know that I am the AH. I guess I am wondering what I should have done or asked and how I can make her feel better. Sorry for the long post.",0,1744056261.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

1jturpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jturpt/the_corpse_of_the_horse/,The Corpse of The Horse,"The morning of March sixth was the moment my world got turned upside down. It was a Thursday morning, colder than usual, an inch or so of snow still avoiding its inevitable fate. I woke up groggy, with the only cure being a hot cup of coffee. As I walk into the kitchen, there it was. The rotting corpse of a horse. 

I was immediately shocked out of my daze. A horse? On my kitchen table? I circled the corpse. It was in a state of decay, its skin and flesh peeling off the bones. Its skull was fully exposed. Empty, dark circles that were once called eyes stared back at me, straight into my soul. 

I fumble around with the lock of my door as I rush out into the stairwell of my apartment, still in my pyjamas. I knocked on the door of my neighbour to no answer. Must've left for work already. As I reenter the room, the stench finally hits me. I gag as the warm scent of blood and rot make it to my nostrils. I made my way to every single one of the windows in my apartment and opened them. It is then that I finally decide to call the police.

I had some time to myself to think in the time the cops arrived. One awful thought kept creeping into my mind. All my doors and windows were locked. How did it get in?

The officers finally arrived while I was waiting in the stairwell. I couldn't bare the smell, the sight, or the implications of that... thing. I went through all the details with them, signed some paperwork, and they were off, having called in some biowaste cleaners. It was more than nothing, but since they didn't see any sign of forced entire there wasn't a lot they could do.

I was left with the horse again. I couldn't leave home since I had to wait for the biowaste team, and I couldn't really sit in the cold stairwell all day. So, with a clothes pin on my nose, I went about my day as normally as I could. 

I tried to keep my gaze away from the rotting pile of meat and bones on my dinner table, I really did, but everytime I passed by the horse to go to the bathroom or get some water, its lifeless stare would burn into the back of my skull.

An hour had passed with no sign of the biowaste team. Though it felt way longer. 

As I got up from my desk to take a leak, the absurdity of the situation finally set in. A fucking horse? And a dead one at that? Why? How? Why me?

I decided to do something. I couldn't just sit on my ass while the horse juices get absorbed by my imported walnut table. I was going to clean the horse up myself.

The soulless eyesockets of the horse stared at me relentlessly as I grabbed the serated knife from the kitchen counter. I was meaning to get a new one anyways. I started with the limbs. The knife when through the flesh and skin as if it was butter. The most disgusting butter known to man. The blade stopped up when I got to the bones, so I had to put some more elbow grease into it.

An hour or two had passed and there still was no sign of the clean up crew, but luckily I had done their job. I had put the body parts of the horse into garbage bags. I double layered them just to make sure. It took me another thirty minutes to carry all of them down to the garbage dunks. I took the head down last. Just so I could take one last look at its hollow eyes before saying goodbye forever. Call it morbid, but I'm just a sentimental person.

Once all the parts were successfully in the trash, I made my way up, hoping that I could get the stench out within the afternoon. Those plans were quickly thrown out, as the horse was back on the kitchen table, exactly as it was before. Well not exactly, the places where I had sawed through the limbs and neck had seemingly healed, to the point where it didn't look rotten at all.

I couldn't take it anymore. All the hours and effort I had put in to getting rid of this pile of rotten bones, just for it to find its way back into my life. As its mocking black voids stared at me, rage filled my body.

I punched it.

I punched the corpse right between its eyes. And then again. And then again.

Blood and gore were spraying onto my beautiful baby blue walls and kitchen cabinets. Skull fragments dug into my knuckles as I kept the punches coming. My white shirt quickly turned to a deep crimson.

The corpse was just a pile of goop by the time I was interrupted by a knock on the door. 

Covered in blood and brains, I open the door.

""Hi?"" I asked sheepishly.

""Bio-waste management, we were told about your horse problem, can I come in?"" The towering man asked firmly, not even looking up from his clipboard

""No."" my answer came out more firm than intended.

He looked up from his clipboard now with a puzzled face, which quickly turned to horror as he saw me.

""Leave."" I continued with my new found moxie as I attempted to slam the door in his face, which his foot blocked.

""Son, I'm here to help, what happened.""

""I said leave!"" I shouted while kicking his foot out of the way and locking the door.

With my heart pounding in my throat, I returned to the depths of my apartment. I could not let them see what I had done, they'd think I was a psychopath! However, I had more pressing matters to attend to.

In my kitchen stood the horse. And not the pile of flesh and gore, not the corpse, no, he was as healthy as, well, a horse.

For just a moment, we stood there, those black voids replaced by pools of crimson as the sun hit the eyes of the beast. We stared at eachother. For just a moment. A calm before the storm. And then, the moment ended.

The beast charged at me, full speed. I dodged it with not even a millisecond to spare. I fell to the floor as the horse rammed into the wall, creating a dent and making all my beautiful artworks on the wall fall.

The horse recovered quicker than me and stood above me. His eyes were not empty and soulless anymore. No, no it was filled with rage and vengeance. As it jumped on its hind legs in preparation to slam its hooves through my heart, I was able to roll out of the way and hop up on my feet. 

I rushed into my bedroom, locking the door and barricading it behind me. I only had two options, and I had to decide quick, as horsey was already ramming into the door trying to break it down. Do I face the horse, or do I risk surviving a fall from the fourth floor. It was a clear choice.

I opened the window and looked down. I could probably aim for the trees down by the street. If I don't get impaled by a branch, It'd probably cushion my fall where I'd get away with minor injuries. No time to think, as the door was slammed open, my barricade did nothing to hinder the stallion.

I took my leap of faith. It only lasted a second, but it could've been hours. I turned around mid air to glance back at the window, and I saw the horse just staring at me before disappearing back into my apartment.

I got away with minor injuries luckily. I stayed with my parents for the next couple of months after the incident. I could not tell them what happened exactly, so I just told them that I needed time away from the city, which was true, nothing better than the fresh countryside air.

I'm still traumatised by what happened on the Sixth of March. I still get freaked out when I see a horse over by the neighbouring ranch. And sometimes, I swear to God, that every now and then, in the middle of the night when even the crickets had gone to sleep, I can hear faint hoofbeats, growing ever louder.",2,1744056095.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

It’s really hard to keep track of it when your world’s reduced to the same four walls, the same pale ceiling, and the same broken body on the same fucking bed you've been lying in for weeks.

Life for me is just living in a prison of day and night and letting the time get the best of me as I feed on painkillers, liquid food and remain functional through some momentary exercises to test if I can still walk or balance myself. I don't sleep deep too - it's in little fragmented dreams between the clicks of melatonin tabs. 

Four months ago, I had an accident. I fell off my bike after a car crashed into me and I hit my head on a streetlight - then came a brain swelling and some nerve damage. I spent the first few weeks in the hospital, and now I’m home, mostly bedridden. I can move with effort - get to the bathroom, to the kitchen if I have to but I’ve been told not to push it. 

My wife’s been... incredible. Yes, too incredible. She’s been stuck here taking care of me like a full-time job . I felt selfish, and I saw it was taking a toll on her - the fatigue, haunted eyes, and nights she pretended to sleep but didn’t.

Last week, she broke down and said she wanted to spend a few days at her sister’s place across town. Just to breathe, or better, catch some sleep and rest. 

I told her to go. Hell, I insisted; now that I mustered up the strength to walk around and get some things done. Maybe that was my guilt talking, but I felt bad for tying her down, for becoming this palsied burden in a bed who needed help for the most trivial things. 

I can't blame myself entirely for my condition, but yes, I also cannot force her to be my slave.

So she left Thursday evening. She kissed my forehead and told me she **still** loved me - promising to call every morning. She said her brother would also drop by often, and that he had a set of spare keys to the front door, so I wouldn't have to get up to receive him.

To be honest, it did make me a bit uncomfortable and anxious.. you know. But I knew Ian quite well, so maybe I was just overthinking it. Whatever.

That night she left, I couldn’t tell when I fell asleep.

I was in that in-between state. What do you call it? ... yeah - *hypnagogic.* Drifting in and out. At some point, I happened to realize I was thirsty. Like really thirsty. My stomach hurt a little too. I hadn't eaten since maybe lunch?

So I got up. Walking had become more comfortable given the little amount of practice I did everyday, but well getting down the stairs was still an ordeal. I did make it downstairs, but halfway down, I heard something.

**Static. Voices. Laughter. A television.**

There’s a flat-screen in the living room that we barely use. It was on. Some sitcom was playing, I don't know which. The laugh track, it was strange .. like quite stuttering and tinny. 

The people on screen were speaking in a language I didn’t know. The colors looked off, and the quality was grainy like they’d been overexposed.

First I figured it was her brother Ian. But it wasn’t him, not at all.. this man was older, broader. His back was to me, posture relaxed, like he owned the place. Weirdly defiant and confident. 

**I should’ve panicked. I didn’t.**

Instead, I just stood there, watching the back of his head, and for some reason… I felt like I *knew* him. Like not well, but well enough to trust that he wasn’t a threat. I walked a little closer, and he turned his head slightly toward me without looking away from the TV. 

*“Thought you’d be asleep,”* he said. His voice was rather calm, almost amused. *“Rachel told me you wouldn’t wake up till morning.”,* he chuckled.

I blinked. ""*Sorry.. who, .. who are you?""*

*“Oh. Cal,""* he said turning his face to mine, like he was remembering something important. *""Her stepfather. Didn't we meet in 2013? ... at your wedding?”*

My stomach tightened.

""*She asked me to stay while she was gone.""* he added. *""Said you’ve been acting weird and needed someone to be around.. I figured I had nothing better to do. How've you been holding up, sonny?”*

His name lit something in the back of my head.. some old photo maybe. Wedding day? 

I didn’t push it. I just nodded and acted like I remembered. But something inside me *wanted him to leave.* Yes, *leave*.

*“I guess I don’t need anything.""* I mumbled, *""Sorry for not recognizing you immediately - I was told Ian would be coming over.""* 

*""Yeah, Ian. I told him to stay home.""* he said. *""Just take care of her, alright? She's been through enough. And now that you're doing better... make sure she stays safe.*"" 

There was a smirk on his face, something unreadable behind it. I don't know why, but I asked, *""Could you leave the spare key here?""*

His smile faltered, just for a second, like he was offended. He pulled the key off his ring and flicked it onto the mantelpiece, then turned toward the door. 

*""Alright,""* he said. *""Take care.""* and he left without another word.

I locked the door after him - also checking the windows. Drank some water. I made my way back up to my bed.

As I slept, I told myself it was nice that someone still cared about Rachel. That she had people watching out for her. Then I slept. Fast.. and deep.

I woke up around 11 a.m. the next day - sunlight already bleeding through the blinds. For a while I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, trying to convince myself the night before had actually happened.

Had Cal really come over? Had I actually gotten up? The dull ache in my legs said yes. But the way my memory melted around the edges… it felt more like a weird lucid dream. 

I didn’t have long to think.

I heard her voice from downstairs, calling my name. It had this brittle edge to it, like she was holding something back. Maybe she came home late last midnight? 

I called out to let her know I was awake. A few minutes later, she was standing at the door to my room (yeah, we slept separately - I needed the entire bed).

She didn’t walk in right away. Just stood there, staring at me.

*“What?”* I asked, forcing a smile. She shook her head. “Nothing. Just… don’t look at me like that.”

*“Like what?”* I wasn't even making a face. Not my first time hearing this either. Does she not like how I look?

*“Like… never mind. You remind me of someone.”* she said, stepping into the room. Her eyes darted to the nightstand where my meds were. *“Did you take your pills yet?”*

I nodded. She sat on the edge of the bed, her shoulders tense. I asked her how the visit to her sister went. She shrugged. *“It was okay. Kind of hard to relax last night though.”*

*“Why? Did she give you trouble all week?”* She hesitated. ***“No. You did.”***

I blinked. *“Me?”* 

Her voice cracked a little. *“I woke up in the middle of the night. You were sitting by my bed.”* There was a long silence.

She kept going, like she’d rehearsed this. “*You were just sitting there, eyes wide open, staring at me. Didn’t say anything. Just… watching. I called your name ... and you didn’t even flinch!?”*

*“I-”* My mouth went dry. *“I didn’t- I wasn’t- even at your sister's place!??”*

She dismissed, *""Not at her place! Early this morning. By my bed. As I slept.. I came home at 3 A.M. last night.""*

*“...That's .. that’s not the first time, either,”* she said. *“I’ve been hearing things at night. Stuff falling. Doors creaking. I thought maybe the meds were messing with your sleep or something. But seeing you just… there, beside me, not blinking- What were you doing?”*

She stopped, wiped at her eyes with the sleeve of her hoodie.

I felt sick. I wanted to say I had no memory of that. That I couldn’t have — I *couldn’t* have, not in the shape I was in. But her voice was real. 

Her fear was real. And part of me was afraid that maybe I had gotten up. **Maybe it** ***was*** **me.**

I thought about telling her about the night before. About Cal. But *something* stopped me. She already looked like she was barely holding it together.

Instead, I just said I was sorry. That I didn’t know what was going on, but I’d talk to someone. That maybe I needed to up my dosage or see my neurologist again...

She nodded and stood up, muttering something about making coffee. I wanted to call out to her to stop her, to ask why she said I reminded her of someone earlier.

**But the words got caught somewhere between my chest and throat.**

I lay there for hours after she left the room. Trying to remember if I’d ever seen Cal’s face before. Trying to remember *what he looked like*. But every time I got close, something changed.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Now I started to hear and feel things. 

Maybe it was what Rachel said. Maybe it was the image of myself, just sitting there, motionless, watching her breathe. That idea crawled under my skin and just... stayed there like a creepy image you couldn't get your eyes off.

I kept trying to tell myself that if I had walked to her room, I would’ve remembered. I would’ve felt it.

But what if I didn’t?

I was hypnagogic again. I heard something more distinct - soft, muffled footsteps over the floorboards. Not loud, but careful.

I stayed in bed at first. Tried to tell myself it was nothing. Maybe the pipes? Maybe Rachel forgot to turn something off.... but the sound didn’t stop. 

And I got this terrible, *absolute* feeling that something was happening I wasn’t supposed to miss.

So I got up, raising myself from the pain. 

Each step was painful. Slow... dragging and terrible.

I didn’t want to wake her, didn’t want her to see me like this. But I needed to check. I needed to make sure I wasn’t turning into something that moved when I didn’t know. 

The hallway was dark. Her door was half open. I saw the moonlight on the sheets. I didn’t breathe.

There was someone in the room.

**Me.**

It was me, standing at the edge of the bed, just looking down at her. My hands were hanging limp by my sides, but there was something tight about the shoulders - like they were coiling.

My wife was asleep, her breathing soft and oblivious. 

I couldn’t move for a second. Couldn’t even think. I just stared, trying to understand what I was seeing. ***It*** wasn’t moving. 

Just watching her, head slightly tilted, the way I imagine I looked when she saw me beside her bed.

And then.. it leaned forward.

Both hands rising. Reaching for her throat, beginning to apply pressure. I could see it smirk from the distance, and begin to grunt. 

I didn’t think. I just ran, or tried to - straddling at the fastest pace I could. 

I broke into a guttural cry, panicking, I launched at him. At *me*. I grabbed his arms, his shoulder and he was warm, and solid.. I still remember that. He turned around, and I saw... 

... I saw nothing.

No one, .. and then I looked down, and my hands were on her. My fingers were curled around the collar of her shirt, close to her neck. She was gasping. Eyes wide and crying.

I stumbled back like I’d been struck, confused- where did the apparition go?. 

***“No,”*** I said. ***“No, no, I didn’t just ... I wasn’t tryi-”***

She curled into herself, sobbing. I reached for her, hands crawling to her on her bed and she visibly flinched.

*“I don’t know what’s happening,”* I said. *“I don’t know... I swear to God, Rachel, I thought..”*

She was shaking her head. *“No... No.. NO! You need help!""* she screamed. *“This is serious! I’m going to call someone.... No..., this isn’t safe!”*

I started crying too. I wasn’t even trying to hold it in anymore. I couldn’t. I was broken. I’d broken her.

“*I don’t mean to,”* I kept saying. *“I don’t want to hurt you. I’d never— you know that. I’d never.”*

She didn’t answer. She just stared at the floor, still hugging herself. ***""Stop looking at me like that! Stop!""*** she suddenly burst out. ***""Why are you smiling!? Do you enjoy this?""*** she gasped in disbelief.

I froze. Smiling? I wasn't smiling, not at all. I didn't think I was. My face felt numb. I wiped at my mouth with the back of my hand. Nothing.. no smirk.

*""Rachel... Rachel.. what's wrong?!""* I bawled, my voice cracking, body shaking. I crawled back. 

She just kept crying, curled up like a child. And then... I don't know why I asked it. Maybe because I needed it to make sense? 

Maybe because... some part of me still wanted to believe it wasn't *me*.

*“Did you tell your stepfather about what’s been happening?”* I mumbled. *“About me sleepwalking or, my health - or me looking off or whatever? Because... he said something the other night.”*

She looked up, confused. Her face pale, choking on her tears. ***“What?”***

*“Cal.""* I said. *""Your stepdad? He came over that night you left... He said you asked him to come and stay.""* I added, *""Said.. you were worried about me, that I'd been acting weird. He told me to take care of you.""*

She didn’t move.

*“Rachel?”* I asked again, voice trembling.

She blinked. And then, slowly, she said, ***“Cal’s dead.”***

The room collapsed inward. My mouth went dry.

*“He strangled my mom... while.. while she was asleep.”* she said, her voice cracking. *“3 years ago. Then.. he killed himself... Don’t you.. don't you remember that?”*

I didn’t respond. Because no, I didn’t. Or maybe I did.

**But if I did... who was it that came over that night?**

**Because if I remember it now... it means he remembers me too.**",2,1744055937.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1jtuj8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1jtuj8d/my_best_buddy_lou_is_having_seizures_qol_advice/,My Best Buddy Lou is having seizures. QOL advice,"My 8 year old boxer hound mix Louie had a seizure last Sunday morning. It was the scariest heartbreaking event I think I've ever endured. He was laying in bed next to me, stiffened, and then started foaming at the mouth and lapping(snapping licking) at the air. He has had reverse sneezing episodes in the past, so I lifted him off the bed and sat down with him in my lap on the floor to comfort him, rub his throat. I noticed he wasn't breathing and then he started convulsing. His eyes were rolling and he was violently shaking, 40 seconds or so in he still hadn't taken a breath. I thought I was witnessing his violent traumatic death. I stuck my finger into his  throat to attempt to check if his airway was blocked. It felt like maybe some food was there so I swirled my finger to loosen it. This immediately triggered him to breath, short tight very labored breaths. Then he urinated all over both of us, as I tried to calmly speak to him ""Louie come back to me buddy"". He then attempted to stand, and started paddling/running. I held him in place now straddling him and he collapsed to his side, eyes straightened and massive panting. No audible/visual reaction, just a blank stare and then panting. 2 minutes in and he slowly stood up, tail between his legs and then took off, kind of half running through the house. I was trying to make sure he didn't run into anything, and I let him outside. He went down into the yard(decent sized, fenced in). Paced around smelling everything, he was visibly afraid of me and just kept pacing/panting for the next 10 minutes. I grabbed him and put icepacks on his belly for a minute or two because he seemed to he overheating. He recovered within an hour and wanted to play, like more than usual for the rest of the day. Now before I go any further and if you're reading this, I did a ton of things wrong here, out of lack of knowledge, and panic. I should not have restrained him, I definitely should not have stuck my hands near his mouth. If there are any other mistakes, feel free to point them out in responses.id much rather have someone read the correct procedure here, instead of trying everything, crying etc like I did. I also waited to take him to the vets the next day. Mainly because I already had an appointment, I did reach out to them by telephone and they said to monitor, and if he had another to take him to the emergency vet. He seemed fine all through the night(sleepless for me) and into the next day until his appointment with his sister Ygritte(10 year old Shar per pit bull mix) for all of their boosters. My mind was racing the entire time as I was searching for external stimuli, poisons, anything that could have caused this. I remembered the night before my friend was over, and had been playing tug of war with Lou(his favorite game, besides fetch), and something strange had happened. At one point both my friend and Lou had tugged at the same time, and Lou dropped the rope and ran into the bedroom visibly shaken up, afraid. Never yelped, and came right back in none the worse for wear. Back to Monday at the vets, went over that scenario, and pointed out a few fatty cysts/tumors in case those were related. They're both small, and have been slowly growing for over a year. The vet acted very nonchalant about the whole thing and acted like it was a once off event. Didn't suggest anti-convulsants or anything. Fast forward to this weekend, after not sleeping well all week, monitoring him and every little dream he had. Friday night, around 1am. Louie has another seizure, about the same, except he got away from me during the paddling episode and ran out of the bedroom slipping all over the tile floor. He expressed his anal glands during one of the slips, and then started violently growling and snapping at me as I tried to stop him from slipping into furniture etc to keep him from injuring himself. That was scary as he has never been even the slightest bit aggressive towards a human. I grabbed him anyway not really thinking of my own safety. Again don't do this, try to coral them to somewhere safe, ideally carpet with no furniture that can be knocked over. He again recovered quickly but was in more distress this time. He seemed ok by morning, i should have taken him to the ER. I have been trying to avoid the ER as it is terribly expensive in this area, $3k-$8k per 24 hours. I've had a few other shocks to my bank account recently, and really can't afford any of this. That beinf said i do alright and will financially recover ina few months, but how these things usually go the timing is rally bad.I went out for lunch thinking he was OK at least enough to do that. I came back and the house was a wreck, coffee table pushed across the room and  Louie and my other dog were both very anxious. Then Lou started foaming at the mouth and shaking, I couldn't handle it anymore and called the ER in hysterics, thank you to the nice receptionist that calmed me down, deep breaths with me,  and just super supportive. We get to the lobby and on cue he went into a seizure and one of the techs rushed out and carried him away. He was in over night, I was there until after midnight trying to make the correct decisions both financially and for Lou. I decided on xrays, in the thought that if he has numerous growths it's probably the big ""C"", 24 hours in observation, a steady IV of anti-convulsants. The vet on staff called me in the morning and said Lou hasn't had any other events, but he was too anxious and pulled numerous IV's, so the only anti-convulsants he had were oral phenobarbital. She suggested I come get him, take a script for that, and continue monitoring. Also to make an appointment with my regular vet. She definitely cautioned me that because of his advanced age, it's probably something that is only going to get worse. She warned I will witness more seizures. She said that if I could I should probably have a neuro-consultation, which I'd like to but I don't have the $500 consult fee or the $3,500 for the MRI. Those are the actual costs. I could put it on credit, so it isn't impossible. So now, about 48 hours later he has not had any events. He has been overly clumsy, and anxious though. I apologize about the book, this whole thing has me in a pretty manic state. I guess I'm asking at which point do I definitely opt for neuro, and if it is fair for me to continue trying to maintain this life for Louie. I love this dog more than anything, and I won't watch him suffer. I also wanted to put this out there so others can learn from my screw ups from inexperience hopefully save someone the trauma.

1jtuj74,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1jtuj74/she_has_lost_it/,She has lost it,"We’ve had this conflict for over half a year. It’s the same conflict we’ve had for years repeatedly and she’s been getting away with it until about half a year ago when I finally set clear boundaries and stood up for my hubby since she’s been abusing him for years. 

Of course at first she froze us out. Then tried to go back to normal and act like nothing happened. We’ve been consistent this time around and repeated that we will not go forward unless she respects our boundaries and shows us she wants to cooperate with us. 

She has now thrown every sort of tantrum - at first she accused me of being my verbally abusive; then she tried blaming hubby of being every sort of “bad boy”, being unthankful and disrespectful; then she tried guilt tripping him into visiting the elderly relatives (“you do know they’re over 90 years old right? Just because you are destroying me and my soul doesn’t mean you have to destroy them too”); then she set some sort of fixed date she expects him to be at her place for coffee. He didn’t accept the invitation, he said that before coffee we needed to meet on neutral grounds to discuss how to move forward so that we wouldn’t get into an argument over the same stuff over and over again. Then she accused me once again for destroying her soul and harassing her (I personally haven’t spoken to her or seen her since the last time I wrote her over 6 months ago).

Then she lost it… she sent my hubby the meanest and most obnoxious letter she’s ever sent. She poured out all sorts of shit including her saying my hubby is a special kind of traitor - the one that only betrays his mother. He was accused of not ever wanting to patch things up and end the conflict (as opposed to her - she has allegedly continuously been trying to make things better and all we do is crap all over it). She also expressed that she never wanted to see or hear from us again and she would never contact us again. The letter also included some very bad insults, some words and comparisons I wouldn’t use on my biggest enemy. 

I’ve had enough of witnessing hubby be hurt and depressed about her inability to act like a normal person. I’ve had enough of her tantrums. We haven’t given into her “button pushing” deliberately and this is how far she has gone. It’s too much. I can never go back. I’ve blocked her on my phone. I never want to see her again, I never want to speak or hear from her again. I know that she’ll start harassing hubby again but IM DONE. I don’t want to even try to negotiate with someone that treats their own child this way. 

I try to support my hubby and help him through this. I’m afraid I’m not able to. He has gotten this kind of shit since he was little. 
Now his mothers side of the family have all turned against us, I’m guessing they’ve heard some sort of a story that isn’t a complete (or even true) story about what’s going on.

1jtufy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jtufy2/aio_for_considering_breaking_off_friend_group/,AIO for considering breaking off friend group making me feel left out,"A few years ago I had a different group of friends and it took me forever to figure out I was the ""bonus friend"" of sorts. They had a separate group chat without me, I was only invited if someone from the core group couldn't go, etc. until I stopped getting invited at all and was ghosted out of the group. 

Now I'm afraid I might be falling into that same thing with a new group. 

The group consists of 3 couples including me and my husband. I never really had a bad feeling about the group until this past weekend. I had texted each of the couples separately about maybe doing something this weekend and they both said no, then one of the couples sends an invite to hangout at their place Sunday. I figured maybe their plans just freed up or something so I said sure. 

They hadn't set a time for the event they just said dinner and movies, so I figured it would be in the evening sometime and I would get a text finalizing a time at some point in the day. I get a call from the couple around 1pm asking when I'm coming over cause they and the other couple have been hanging out since brunch and they wanted to start a movie. We were in the middle of a hike so we wouldn't be able to get there for at least 2 hours, but I would let them know when we're about twenty minutes out. When we arrived they had just starting playing a 4 player game. Not a huge deal we would just chill on the couch until they were done. About half an hour in though I realized this was gonna take much longer than expected and the insecurity of being the bonus friend started bubbling up and I texted my husband to tell everyone we were going for coffee and we'd be right back because I was about to cry in front of everyone.

The second we got to the car the tears just started and it took an hour for me to collect myself and not look like I was crying so we could return. When we got back the others just said ""oh we didn't think you were coming back"" and the vibe just felt super off. We stayed for a movie but bounced the second it was over. 

Also worth mentioning very early on in the friendship we were together on a Friday and one of them said they were excited for brunch Saturday, and when I looked confused they looked back at friend 2 and said ""did you not invite her?"" And friend 2 said ""she's always busy on the weekends anyway"" so I said ""oh no we're around this weekend actually!"" And friend 2 just said ""oh"" but didn't follow with an invite. Awkward but chalked it up to the early budding friendship.

Weird that both were brunch incidents 😅

I really don't want to intrude in spaces I'm not welcome but I also don't want to cut people off just because my insecurities say they secretly hate me. 

I also recognize that people are allowed to have different ""tiers"" of friends and I don't have to be included in everything, and I might just be feeling hurt that I had them in a higher tier than they had me. 

I didn't even realize I had that much hurt over the first group incident until I was in that car sobbing. 

My instinct right now is to ghost them before they can do it to me, AIO? ",6,1744055291.0,AmIOverreacting,10,0.88,False

My boyfriend and I have been together over 5 years. He still does not talk about his feeling with me nor does he confront his feelings. Long story short, his mom left when he was really young and he went to a few therapy sessions then but states that he hated talking to the lady he was sent to. I have asked him to consider therapy before because of the way he treats me. It feels like he treats me like a mom, not a partner. I have expressed this to him before but I have to approach it nicely. The last time I mentioned it, he said ""well I don't have a mom so..."". Like???


This past week has been a rough one. He spilled coffee on a brand new white shirt and comes into the bed room and said ""Mommy I spilled"". I just ignored the mommy part and said to use the shout under the sink. He then took off his shirt, THRE IT AT ME, and said ""no mommy needs to do it"". ????? I then toss it back to him and say ""no you do it"" because you are literally an adult and can spray shout on your own shirt? We went back a forth about 4 times until he got pissed at me and said ""I literally asked for help and you won't help me"". But you didnt ask?? You demanded that ""mommy"" should do it.


Other issues we have had are like he wants me to ask him when I want to spend money. Even if it is $5. He got mad at me for spending $5 at Joann's to make a necklace in honor of my dead dog. We do not have a joint bank account. Yes, we are on a budget but we are not struggling per say. Our dog recently had surgery so we are on a payment plan for that but $5 will not make or break the budget.


My sister had a baby 2 weeks ago and we have been talking a lot over facetime as I am halfway across the country from them. (I moved to be with my bf). He has been saying that I talk to my family too much. My sister just had a baby. This is my first nephew. I am excited to meet him in a month. I do not need to be judged for talking to my family. He does not talk to his family often, like maybe once every 3+ months.
He has commented on my look recently as well. I have a more alternative look now than when we first started dating. I had my natural blond hair and a nostril piercing. He told me that he liked me better as a blonde. He has commented on my mannerisms more too. Like I have a process when I come home from work and get a little frustrated when the process changes. ( I am actively working on this in therapy).

I just have no idea what to do. I have talked to my sisters and they said that I need to give him an ultimatum. Go to therapy or I leave. But I don't know if that is the right choice? He needs to go to therapy. Period. I know this. Our friends have mentioned it before to him too. Please give me your honest advise. I do not care how mean or blunt it is.

It reminds me of multi-colored prison bars.

James here.

Even short coffee Zoom’s…

…with seemingly qualified partners…

…If I had to fit myself around other people's schedules?...

…Day after day…

…and week after week?

I don’t care how much the deal is potentially worth.

A colonoscopy would sound like more fun.

Is that just me?

If not, and you’re over the whole ‘fit yourself into 7 people’s calendars just to maybe make a buck’ model?

Check out Travis’ mini-book, [The Truth About Passive Income](https://honeysyed.com/truth).

It’s free, and walks through how to set up deals where people come to you ready, filtered, and pre-sold.

Now

Don’t get me wrong.

I’m not saying to never do calls.

Or that Zoom’s a bad tool to make sure you and a partner click.

Zoom’s got a lot of great uses.

My point is…

You can pick out ONLY your perfect partners…

…have a coffee Zoom with ONLY them…

…And ditch the “let’s see if there’s a fit” calls.

BEFORE ever scheduling a meeting.

The ‘trick’...

…If you wanna call it one…

…Is to sift and sort with your posts and content.

Ask the right questions?

The right people (and only the right people) will raise their hands.

Which might take a mental shift…

Especially if you’re used to people raising their hands like it’s the wave at a baseball game.

But the end result…

…By asking Sifting and Sorting questions…

…Is like standing up in a poker room and shouting:

“I have the King, Queen, Jack, and ten of hearts! Who has the Ace?”

You’ll only hear from folks with the Ace you can work with.",1,1744054919.0,foundonx,0,1.0,False
1jtua2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestDavao/comments/1jtua2s/i_kind_of_wish_i_asked/,I kind of wish I asked.,"I (M25) was celebrating with my friends in Echelon during the 5th of April. The crowd was boring and there were too few people for a Saturday night. Eventually, the number of people increased, and the vibe became more fun as we loosen up with the alcohol kicking-in.   
  
Then there she was, a beautiful girl whose face has still been stuck on my mind up until now. There were lots of pretty faces that night, but her face was just something I could not forget so easily. I can't help but stare but also wish I wasn't creepy or bothering her night out with her girlies.   
  
I wanted to ask for her socials and maybe meet over coffee or tea, but I am at a time now in my life where I know that I need to lock-in and discover and understand myself. I have been avoiding disturbing women whom I know I am not ready for.

After shots of tequila and sharing a good laugh with my friends as we celebrate my best friend's migration to another country. We left in search of another place to drink to. The night ended without me asking for her socials. 

Up until now, I kind of wish I did try. I just can't seem to forget that smile. Although that moment was ephemeral, it still lasts longer than it should have. I may not be too sure, if she was interested as well or if she was single in the first time, but I wished I took the risk. 

If ever I come across her again, I'll definitely ask. Until then, she was just too beautiful to forget. ",1,1744054890.0,OffMyChestDavao,0,1.0,False

Now to the problem, from what we learned the pressure has to be in the “espresso range” while extracting, otherwise you get an over or underextraction? From the instruction we learned finer grind means the espresso machine needs more pressure to get the water through the grinded coffee.

So we started with setting on 5 and never even touched the “espresso range” now we made our way down to grind size 2 and we are barely touching the “espresso range”.

What are we doing wrong? We set the grind amount with the razor as it says in the instruction. When tampering we are applying a good amount of force, at least enough that you can get rid of the access coffee after using the razor without dropping all the coffee.

n this universe the worst part of the story didn't happen.

Ichigo owns a chain of coffee shops.

\- Ai and Hikaru met in a cafe, having a seemingly normal life.

\-Hikaru was adopted by an elderly couple who gave him all the love that any family can give to a child. Sadly, his adoptive parents died and Hikaru was very sad. He decided to sell the house and some properties he inherited to try to forget the loss of his parents and finish his career (he pays all the expenses).

\-Ai was taken by the Japanese child protection service when she was 9 years old after the terrible treatment she received from her mother and she spent time with several foster families, sadly no one wanted to adopt her which depressed her a lot, finally Ichigo officially adopted her when she was 15 although it was out of pity, although later she really considered her her son and became very overprotective of her.

\-Hikaru is a lonely boy with a few friends and no girlfriend, although some girls are interested in him, but he started to fall in love when he went to eat at a certain cafe.

\-Ai starts working for Ichigo as a thank you for having adopted her. Curiously, many customers, especially young people, go to the cafeteria just to see Ai.

Ichigo rejects Hikaru and even forbids him from entering with a guard at the door, but Ai convinces him that Hikaru is a good boy and allows them to go out together. The reason Ai fell in love with Hikaru is that he is a college student and discovered that he is an orphan like her.

\-Sadly, one day Ichigo is offered to do a commercial, but the model who was going to star in it quits at the last minute and, desperate, they hire Ai. To everyone's surprise, the commercial becomes the most viewed, but that creates problems when another girl from a competing franchise swears to return to first place... the girl is Nino.

I’ve been doing quite a bit of private freelance work (architecture/design) alongside my full-time job, and the income has grown to the point where I’m potentially earning around R100k–R300k extra a year. I paid personal income tax in March and got hit pretty hard, so now I’m thinking about registering a company to manage that income separately.

I'm pretty much a noob when it comes to finances, business, tax, etc. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but these should be the logical steps:

* Set up a company and business bank account
* Put all freelance income through it
* Deduct business-related expenses (laptop, car/petrol for site visits, client meetings, software, etc)
* Hopefully lower my total tax bill in the process

**A few questions for those who’ve done this:**

1. Did registering a company actually save you money in the long run? Ps. a friend of mine told me that its possible to buy a dormant company, would that be easier? 
2. Do you use a tax consultant *and* an accountant, or does one person usually cover everything?
3. How do you handle:
   * Claiming car/petrol/maintenance for work?
   * Buying a new laptop or phone — do you expense it fully?
   * Home office stuff (I do private work from home)
   * Business lunches/coffee meetings with clients
4. How do you draw income — salary or just occasional dividends?
5. Any common mistakes to avoid when starting out?

Also — is there someone or a company you’d recommend that can help set everything up (company registration, bookkeeping, tax submissions, etc)? Preferably based in Cape Town (Northern Suburbs if possible) with decent rates.

Would really appreciate any advice or leads. Not trying to dodge tax, just want to do things properly, understand the ins and out and not get nailed again next tax season. Appreciate any feedback, TIA! Cheers",1,1744054299.0,PersonalFinanceZA,1,1.0,False

In truth, I'd love to have thought-provoking conversations a man whose intellectual curiosity and interests align with mine. My intellectual interests are varied, but they lean more towards the human condition. I'm always curious about how people experience life and why they experience life the way they do. I value thoughtful discussions around this, including diverse perspectives, which lead to genuine connection.

When I'm not listening to audiobooks, I'm scrolling through socials. I love going on nature walks. I also enjoy discovering new places, dining out, and meeting people. I'm into health and fitness, and I equally spend a considerable amount of time Googling recipes, meal prepping, or tailoring my workout. I'm open to discovering new hobbies. We could try some of yours.

I would love to connect with a man who is intellectually curious and thoughtful. Quiet, introverted men have always been my Achilles' heel. Though nowadays, I equally find myself drawn to men who are self-aware, considerate, and who value vulnerability and connection.

If the above describes you, and you are single, unattached, 32yo+, and UK-based, I'd love to hear from you. I'm not particular about your looks, height, or occupation. For reference, I, myself, am Black, BBW, 5""5, and I work in the health care industry.

We would be moving things to Discord when we both feel comfortable, exchanging pics, voice notes and having phone calls. And just as well, meeting up at some point, for a coffee, a walk, or new activities we might both find interesting to see if there's potential to move things further along.

Would be great to have a chat with someone (I'd appreciate fluent English speaking but if you're learning that's also completely fine and I'd gladly help out!) as I'm feeling pretty down and have been ghosted several times over the last few attempts to reach out to people. It's not doing wonders for my mental health at the moment. I feel like I'm going through it a bit right now and the constant state of dread, anxiety and loneliness that my mind is suffering with is really starting to hurt. Aside from that, I think all I need is a friend to chat with, not gonna trauma dump or anything but just a regular chat to keep grounded is all I'm looking for. 

I'm in Glasgow in a few weeks and plan on going to Europe soon also, would love to have some recommendations on spots there. 

I'm British and from the north of England. I enjoy travelling, coffee, exploring new cultures, live events and more. Tell me a little about you? Happy to move onto other apps where needed as well or we can stay here. Big fan of 'alt' people too.

Preface

This short work sets out to explore certain aspects of the Buddha’s Teaching recorded in the Pali Suttas. Its manner of doing so, however, may seem unfamiliar in the prevailing atmosphere of scientific common sense. And in fact its aim is also to suggest that the Suttas will necessarily remain incomprehensible so long as common sense is taken for granted, and to exemplify what may perhaps be found a more fruitful way of approach. But it makes no claim to finality.

What, exactly, did the Buddha teach? That he taught the way to *nibbāna* or extinction there is no doubt at all. But what is extinction? We are told (Aṅguttaranikāya, X,i,6) that extinction is cessation of being, *bhavanirodha*. We shall not be surprised, therefore, to find that the Suttas are largely devoted to the analysis of being. And the key to an understanding of the Suttas is undoubtedly recognition of the fact that they are centred on a hard nucleus of ontology—things ‘must be seen, with right understanding, *as they are*’ (Khandha Saṃyutta, vi,7). But how, in fact, *are* things? The answer is really very simple:[^(2)](javascript:void(0)) things are as they appear; for how else could right understanding ever *see* them as they are? If a thing can *appear*, however, it can also *disappear*; and this shows that it must appear *to* something that does *not* disappear. To what does it appear? It appears to *me*. It seems, then, that a thing as it appears is only part of a total situation, the other part of which is myself; and since to *understand* a thing as it is I must study its appearance (and disappearance) I must consequently not ignore that total situation; but I cannot investigate the total situation without investigating myself. Thus there can be no understanding of things as they are without self-observation. It is precisely because of its blindness to this fact that natural science is compelled, in the last analysis, to invoke the mysterious notion of common sense.

The professional rationalists, however, do not hold undisputed sway. Their unreasonable claims that reason can explain all things have always been questioned, and of late years particularly by the phenomenologists. This school (which is comparatively little known in the English-speaking world), basing itself on the absolute reflexive certainty of the Cartesian *cogito ergo sum*, understands that phenomena show themselves for what they are and that since they do not conceal any reality behind their appearance they can be studied and described simply as they appear. The fact will at once be plain that the remarks above on the Buddha’s Teaching were not made in ignorance of such doctrines. And indeed, as regards method, the present work owes a particular debt to the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre, one of the leading exponents of the school. If this work should be found to throw light in dark corners, the fact of such indebtedness may be of value as indicating a possible way of transition from traditional Western ideas to the Buddha’s Teaching. What follows, however, is not a treatise on phenomenology as such, and it supposes that other sources will be accessible to those who find difficulty in adapting themselves to an unaccustomed way of thinking. Moreover it should not be presumed that an acknowledgement of indebtedness necessarily implies agreement at all points with the writings concerned: the present work, in fact, goes further than they; nor does it accept them as unquestionably authoritative. In certain matters, indeed, they are thought to be[^(3)](javascript:void(0)) mistaken. This needs emphasizing; for though they may seem to provide a means of access to the Buddha’s Teaching they are not in any way regarded as supplanting it.

Common sense may denounce as scandalous and highly unlikely the view of things that eventually emerges, namely, that my manifold possibilities at every level of generality are always all existing at once, and that they continue to be so on the express condition that they do not appear as such but as so many rival intrinsic probabilities—as an objective world. But, after all, the phenomenon of precognition is antecedently no less unlikely in the eye of reason; yet, by the ultimate standards of reason itself, to wit, statistical exclusion of chance, it is a well-established fact. And on the view of things that emerges (and particularly after the discussion of equivocal premonitions in Appendix VII) it seems that we may be able to describe the possibility of precognition as a regular structural feature of experience. On the same view of things we find that we cannot describe the future as predetermined. If phenomenological ontology should be capable (as it seems it might), not only of accomodating such an awkward fact as precognition, but also of reconciling it with indeterminacy in a single coherent picture, it would certainly enjoy a decided advantage over the rationalist view, which is here at a complete loss. This,[^(4)](javascript:void(0)) however, is no absolute criterion; for the Buddha’s Teaching is concerned with bringing an end to being, not with description for its own sake; and the final appeal in deciding on one line of approach rather than another can only be to whether or not it leads to extinction. But each must determine this for himself.

Acknowledgement of indebtedness must also be made to Dr. Ross Ashby’s admirably lucid book (see References), which sets out to account for the stability of animal behaviour in physiological terms by making use of the principles of cybernetics. This book has clarified and crystallized certain ideas and suggested several fruitful lines of thought. But it will become clear that the basic assumptions of such an approach—common sense, the study of behaviour from outside (valid only for *other* people’s behaviour), the physiological view of feeling—are quite unacceptable.

The work consists of a short essay followed by a series of appendices. In the essay matters are presented with extreme simplification and generality, and expansions and qualifications are omitted that would be indispensable in a longer account. In the appendices, however, certain descriptions have been developed in greater detail, but with less regard for orderly presentation. They are intended as threads to guide readers who have not been discouraged by the essay and who want to pursue matters further. There is no direct exegesis of the Suttas, and though (for example) most of the individual terms of the usual formulation of dependent arising (*paṭiccasamuppāda*) will be recognized in one place or another, such formulation is not discussed specifically. Nevertheless it is hoped that this enigmatic Sutta statement, as well as others, will seem less arbitrary in the light of what is said. A Pali-English Conversion Table of principal terms will be found at the end.

Can rebirth be proved? The last word is always emphasized. And it is certain that we should willingly trade all the circumstantial evidence in the world, all the cases, however well attested, of the Societies for Psychical Research, all the direct testimony of those who claim to have knowledge of their former lives, against one good satisfying proof (or disproof, for that matter) of rebirth that convinced us personally, at any hour of the day or night, beyond all possible manner of doubt.



Clearly, if such a proof is to be entirely convincing at any moment at all that we care to consult it, then it must not depend on an act of memory, for the good reason that we cannot trust our memory with that complete certainty we are looking for. Thus we cannot accept a proof that involves such evidence, however attractive, as an apparition once seen, a message once received from the dead, a memory of what appears to be a past life. And in no circumstances can we be satisfied with a proof consisting of an inferential logical argument; for if it is deductive we can always doubt the premisses (to which the argument adds nothing), and if inductive, the conclusion (which is no more than probable). A proof that shall be entirely convincing at all times can only be found in what is at all times to hand and beyond doubt, namely our immediate conscious experience; and this proof, when stated, will necessarily be in the form not of a reasoned argument but of a description—a description of what each of us can see for himself whenever he wishes. So the question narrows itself down to this: Given the actual facts of conscious experience as we may at any time observe them, do we find any characteristics such that upon seeing them we cannot doubt rebirth?



‘What are our natural principles,’ asks Pascal ‘if not our habitual principles? A different habit will give other natural principles. This is seen by experience. Fathers fear that their children’s natural love will get effaced. What, then, is this nature that is liable to be effaced? Habit is a second nature that destroys the first. Why is habit not natural? I am very much afraid that this nature is itself only a first habit, as habit is a second nature’. Our nature is nothing else than our habit. A nature or habit destroys a preceding nature or habit. On these two observations we hope to build an absolutely certain proof of rebirth.



What, first, is our nature? It is easy to reply that it is what governs our behaviour in any given circumstances. But we must avoid a trap. My behaviour as it appears to other people is by no means the same thing as what it appears to myself; for there is no certainty at all that my bodily activities and their repercussions in the world will in fact accord with what I am intending. I am given a cup of tea; there is glass jar on the table containing a white substance; I open the jar and put some of the contents in my cup; an onlooker who believes that the substance is arsenic says to me ‘Why are you poisoning yourself?’; ‘I don’t understand you,’ I reply ‘I am putting sugar in my tea’. Who is right? Certainly, the consequences of my putting the white substance in my tea will depend on whether it is sugar or arsenic—time will tell. But if I am to investigate my nature there is no doubt at all that my behaviour must be regarded as my intention; for even if the stuff really is arsenic and I do in fact poison myself, yet my nature is clearly to be drinking tea with sugar and not to be putting an end to my life, whatever outside appearances may say. The distinction between my behaviour as it is for other people—externally observed modifications in my body and in the world (of which my body is a part)—and my behaviour as it is for myself—my intention, what I am intending—is of fundamental importance, and if we confound the two we shall condemn ourselves to understand nothing of the matter. See Appendix I. Since, therefore, we are concerned with my experience as I myself observe it, my behaviour or action must be understood as my intention, and the external point of view is to be excluded at all times with the utmost rigour. ‘It is intention, monks, that I say is action: in intending one does action by body, speech, or mind.’ (Aṅguttaranikāya, VI,vi,9). See Appendix VI.



My nature, then, is what governs my behaviour, that is to say my intention, in any given circumstances. And it follows from this definition that so long as I have a certain nature my behaviour or intention under similar circumstances must always be the same. Thus, whenever I am given a cup of tea, if I always put sugar in it that is ‘because it is my nature to put sugar in my tea’; and, obviously, so long as this is my nature I shall continue to put sugar in my tea. But what is this nature if not my habit of putting sugar in my tea? It comes to exactly the same thing whether I say that it is my habit to put sugar in my tea, or that I put sugar in my tea because it is my nature to do so. My habit is my nature and my nature is my habit, and we have only to choose which word we prefer. If my behaviour was not always the same under similar circumstances, if in other words it was not habitual, how could I speak of having a nature? (And even if I say that it is my nature to be inconsistent, that can only be because I am inconsistent by habit.)



This all sounds very well, but is it correct? While we have been busy examining the credentials of the word behaviour we have allowed the word circumstances to pass unchallenged. What, exactly, do we mean by circumstances? What were the circumstances when I was putting arsenic in my tea under the impression that it was sugar? To the onlooker it was arsenic that I was putting in my tea, but to me, immediately, it was sugar. In other words, if circumstances are seen from the external point of view they are unsatisfactory as a guide to my intention, and if they are seen from my own point of view at the time of the intention they are an integral part of that intention—or rather, from my point of view, there are no circumstances to be seen. So long as my intention remains the same I cannot possibly say that circumstances have altered, because I see nothing independent of my intention (if my intention is to be putting sugar in my tea, then what I am putting in my tea is necessarily sugar); and this is true even though, from the external point of view (which I myself can adopt at a later time, that is to say when my intention is to be ‘examining the circumstances under which I was “putting sugar in my tea”’ and no longer to be ‘putting sugar in my tea’), the circumstances are observed to be quite different—the ‘sugar’ is arsenic and the ‘tea’ is soup. The use of the word circumstances, as we now see, is either misleading or redundant, and if we are to escape the physiological trap we must abandon it as an explanation of my behaviour. My nature is now no longer what governs my behaviour ‘in any given circumstances’: it is indistinguishable from my behaviour, it is what I am intending. And my behaviour is habitual, not when ‘it is always the same under similar circumstances’, but simply when my intention does not change. If my intention to be putting sugar in my tea is observed by me as being to some extent stable, then my behaviour is habitual. But the important thing is that I do observe this; my behaviour is habitual; it is a perpetual feature of my observed experience that each particular intention does persist unchanged for some period of time, long or short. Our nature, then, is the name we give to a certain element of stability in our experience: a habit, as anybody who has ever tried to give one up can testify, has a tendency to stick; and some (such as eating and breathing) are so stable that they normally stay with us, once we have acquired them, for the rest of our life. This stability, it will be noticed, is stability in time: time passes but our nature remains unchanged. But this is not to say that our nature does not in time change; it does, as Pascal observed; but it does not change simply because a certain amount of time has passed: we do not expect our long-established habits to change sooner than our later ones just because we have had them longer, but rather the contrary—the age of our habits is an indication of their stability.



When does our nature change? In Pascal’s experience (not our usual sense of the word in this essay) it changes when a fresh nature destroys it. And when is this? Evidently when it ceases to be satisfactory. It is my nature (or habit) to be taking sugar in my tea. But suppose (for any reason that a physiologist may care to assume) I begin to find that each time I sugar my tea I am afflicted with nausea, though if I take it unsweetened nothing unpleasant happens. When I now drink sweet tea my former idea (or field—Appendix III refers) combining the qualities or characteristics of sweet tea and those of bodily comfort is replaced by another idea combining the qualities of sweet tea and those of nausea; whereupon I give up sweet tea. And this change takes place because the former idea is no longer satisfactory—so long as I have it I make myself sick. (By satisfactory we must understand the least unpleasant available. See Appendix II.) In other words my nature becomes not to be taking sugar in my tea but to be drinking it without (perhaps with lemon or something else). My nature, then, has changed; a fresh nature has replaced the old. But the old nature has not merely been replaced (as one might replace a broken cup with a new one after throwing away the pieces); it has been utterly destroyed. How is this? By the simple fact that the new nature is exactly contrary to the old: formerly it was my nature to be sugaring my tea, now my nature is not to be sugaring my tea. But—it may be objected—you are still drinking tea; there is no change at all in that. And this is true: although I have given up drinking sweet tea, I still find tea stimulating and I am drinking as much as before, but unsweetened. There has undeniably been a complete reversal of my nature, but only at a certain level of generality; and that this is always the case in our life we may observe for ourselves—we never change all our habits at once. It may be seen, furthermore, that the whole of our experience is nothing else but a continual reversing of our nature at one level or another, that is to say of some particular intention (though it will be evident that these reversals are normally very particular: breathing in, breathing out, breathing in, breathing out, to choose the simplest example). Every change of my nature is a denial of that nature, but carried out against the background, or in the light, of a more general nature, which at that time remains constant. Note, however, that this is the necessary structure of my change; for, so long as it is possible to compare the earlier nature with the later nature (which is the direct opposite of the earlier)—so long, in other words, as we can say ‘something has changed’ or ‘I have changed’—the two natures will have something in common; and this, precisely, is the more general nature or character that remains unchanged on that occasion. See Appendix III. If I change from ‘taking sugar in my tea’ to ‘not taking sugar in my tea’ there is the general character ‘drinking tea’ that remains constant; but I might instead change from ‘drinking tea’ to ‘drinking coffee (i.e. not drinking tea)’, and here it is the still more general character ‘being a drinker of hot drinks’ that is constant. And there is no upper limit to the possible level of generality. In one way, however, there is, but it is essentially reflexive: our nature is never wholly without some element of self-appraisal. Ultimately we must choose (unless we are choosing not to be choosing) between the attitude of approving existence (or being) and the opposite attitude of disapproving it. ‘There are, monks, these two views: the view of being and the view of non-being. Whatever ascetics and recluses there are, monks, who adhere to the view of being, who resort to the view of being, who embrace the view of being, they all oppose the view of non-being. Whatever ascetics and recluses there are, monks, who adhere to the view of non-being, who resort to the view of non-being, who embrace the view of non-being, they all oppose the view of being.’ (Majjhimanikāya, ii,1) Conscious beings, for the most part (that is to say except when they are aware of their plight, at which time their reflexion tends to be sheer—Appendix IV refers), are divided between these two reflexive attitudes in the face of existence; they are welcoming it or they are repulsing it, asserting it or denying it. And what is the still more general nature that must remain constant as we pass from the one to the other and back again? It is simply ‘having-to-do with existence’.5 (Strictly, this change in reflexive attitude will not be quite the same as the switch from one unreflexive attitude to another. But we need not stop to consider this.) And is it possible not to be ‘having-to-do with existence’? It seems likely: but if it is possible it is a one-way change; for it is the change from ‘having a nature at all’ to the nature of ‘not having a nature at all’, and when there is no nature at all there is no longer anything to change. Note that the description ‘the nature of not having a nature at all’ is self-destructive: that is because words are part of existence and can only describe existence, and where existence has ceased there is nothing to be said. ‘With the removal of all natures, all modes of saying, too, are removed.’ (Suttanipāta, V,vii,8)



Let us see where we have got to. Our nature, at any given level, remains constant for just so long as it remains satisfactory; and that is to say that the structure of our experience is autonomous: experience does not vary as a function of an absolute time but determines its own changes from one stable attitude (at any level) to another; in a word, it is self-adaptive; and there is no given limit to the length of time its attitude, at any one level, will remain unchanged. In particular, when our nature does change, it changes completely: it is replaced by a nature that is the exact contrary. But it is the exact contrary only at a certain level of generality; which fact automatically entails that our nature at a higher level of generality remains unchanged (though with prejudice to its changing on some other occasion). But our nature only appears in this hierarchical form if we carefully observe it while it changes; and when we do not make this effort it keeps its secret.



My present nature, then, at any given level, remains constant until such time as it ceases to be satisfactory, when it gives place to an exactly contrary nature. But what is my present nature, at any one level, but the reversal of a previous nature? My nature, at any level on which I care to consider it, is built on the ruins of a past nature. The fact that I now have a nature at all requires that I must have had a nature in the past; for my present nature, in one sense, is my past nature. If, at one level, my nature changes to the exact opposite of my preceding nature, then at a more general level it necessarily remains the same; this is to say that at some level or other of generality my nature is what it was, and this is always true; and, in fact, whenever we reflect we shall invariably find that at one level or another we are in the middle of doing (or being) something. Thus the necessity of past experience is to be seen, if we look, in every moment of our present experience. If, therefore, at any time (at conception, at birth, last year, yesterday) I was created out of nothing or came into being spontaneously, then I was created with (or as) a nature (for otherwise I should not have a nature at present); and if I was created with a nature, I was created with past experience. Thus if I was created it was done in such a way that it is not just practically, but absolutely and inherently impossible for me to discover the fact. This, of course, is not a logical proof that I was not created; for it is equally impossible for me to refute the suggestion that I was created (say five minutes ago in the middle of writing this essay together with half of it already written in what appears to be my handwriting); but when I see that everything happens as if I always had a past it never occurs to me to try and do so. And when I notice in particular that I must have a past even to be able to consider the suggestion that I might not, then the suggestion remains meaningless, and I am quite untouched.



And future existence? By observing our present experience we see that it has the structure of an autonomous system determining its own changes from one stable attitude to another. Whenever it changes its attitude (or adapts itself) at any given level it only does so by taking up a contrary attitude; and every attitude without exception persists until such a change takes place. In other words, our experience has a structure such that it cannot but continue indefinitely—time is powerless to stop it. The only way in which experience could possibly come to an end is if it changed from having-an-attitude to not-having-an-attitude; but this change, like all other changes, must come from within experience itself, even though, unlike all other changes, it would be a change to end all changes. The fact of experience, then, is independent of any absolute time (it is ontologically prior to time: there is appearance of time only because of the fact of experiences—Appendix VI refers), and experience itself must necessarily continue to exist until such time as it determines itself to stop ‘having-to-do with existence’. And when I see this necessity, that I must have a future, the suggestion that I might arbitrarily be annihilated (at death or at any other time) will fare no better than its brother a few minutes ago.



We promised ourselves ‘an absolutely certain proof of rebirth’. Have we got it? Our proof is based on direct observation of present experience at any time; and we have shown that that experience appears to the observer as a system with certain structural features. In particular, the system is seen to involve past experience as an integral part of its structure and to be autonomous in time. Since this is direct observation of present experience, it shares the same degree of certainty as the actual existence of that experience, neither more nor less. See Appendix IV. But how certain is the existence of our present experience? It is absolutely certain; for it is impossible to doubt. Anyone who genuinely, honestly and in good faith, is doubting the existence of his present experience is successfully deceiving himself; for of one thing he is certain, namely that he is doubting his present experience. He has no doubt whatever of the existence of his present experience, which is, precisely, his doubting. (It will be seen that there are two orders of consciousness involved here: if I am doubting my experience, that is itself a certain complex cognitive experience, which, non-cognitively, I do not doubt—Appendices IV & VI refer.) But does certainty about the structure of experience make rebirth equally certain? If we see with absolute certainty that all experience without exception must involve previous experience, we shall be absolutely unable to entertain the idea of any first beginning to experience; and if we see with absolute certainty that it is autonomous, we shall be absolutely unable to entertain the idea of any ending to experience not brought about from within experience itself. But can we be absolutely certain that all experience without exception, and not just present experience, has these characteristics? Might not the structure of experience change? It is absolutely impossible to conceive that the structure of experience could be other than it is, for the reason that our conception of the structure of experience is itself experience and therefore the structure of experience: if the structure of experience changed there would no longer be any conception of the structure of experience (or indeed of anything else), and it is absolutely impossible to conceive of a state of affairs devoid of conception, because where there was no conception there would be no state of affairs. More simply: the structure of experience is the structure of existence or being, and if that structure changed I should cease to be—and it is impossible to imagine that situation, because there would not then be any situation to imagine. If we see that it is inherently impossible to conceive of experience with a different structure, we shall be absolutely unable to suspect that a different structure could ever exist.



This proof of rebirth is absolutely certain: it is as certain as our own existence. By sheer reflexion at any time it is possible for us to see in the structure of our present experience that our existence is necessarily without a beginning and that it necessarily continues until it puts an end to itself from within. And to the extent that we see these necessities at all we see them with certainty: but the trouble is that to see them is by no means easy—that needs hard work.

1jttri6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jttri6/there_is_something_wrong_in_a_small_alaskan/,There is something wrong in a small Alaskan village.,"Hello all. My computer has just flickered on, the lights outside must be fucking with the power again. I'm typing this as fast as I can, so apologies for any misspellings. My hands are shaking. The fire went out hours ago and I'm too afraid to relight it, relight my humble beacon against the lights. Those goddamn lights.

The village of Nenana is a peaceful place. Less than 50 of us. We live out in the bushes, Central Alaska, north of any reasonable human, along the Sushana river. It's quiet here. We hunt, fish, work the forest for timber and keep to ourselves. Folks from Outside pass through often, pause, marvel at the little log houses and gawk as we go about our daily lives. I was born here. I was raised here. And from the looks of things, I will die here. I am a young man, 20 winters. I was raised by my grandparents after my father passed in a blizzard while hunting. I still remember his frozen body as it was dragged in the sled behind the snowmachine. I remember his face, blue-black like the crimson dark of night. I remember his eyes. I remember I watched as the crowd of people gathered, a lone drumbeat as the heartbeat of our community in this moment. I saw a raven fly. We gathered to lay him to rest, an affair that took up the space of a whole day and everyone's attention.

It started months ago. Or was it weeks? Hell, it might've been yesterday. First, Old Isaiah didn't stop in. I was working my incredibly boring job at our town's only gas station and general store. Sitting behind my desk I watched our people ebb and flow, tumbling through life like the river. Every day that man would come in. He shuffled with a slight limp, walking like a just born caribou calf. He lived on the edge of town, in a small run down cabin that had been left behind when some family moved Outside. I found comfort in his visits, in our silent exchanges as he purchased the same bag of coffee grounds and gave the same nod and mumble as I handed him his change. Then one day he didn't come. I waited, drumming my fingers on the countertop in time to the twangy country music on the radio. Zack Bryan, maybe? I always hated him. But the old feller didn't show. I brushed it off at first, maybe his shitbox pickup had finally quit on him. Maybe he simply didn't want coffee. Maybe he was out of money. I passed his absence off and continued my day. 0 customers. New record.

A few days passed. Still no Isaiah. No one said anything, but I started noticing it in the way folks looked over their shoulders. It was like a quiet breath had passed through the village, taking something with it.

Then the dogs started acting strange. My neighbor, a crusty old man named Jimbo with a beard that looked like frostbite, came in one morning—eyes wide, skin pale like he’d seen something deep. He said all three of his sled dogs had broken their leads and run off in the night. Just tore free, left the collars behind. ""Tails tucked. Howlin’ like the spirits were on their asses."" That’s what he said. I laughed it off, but there was something in his voice. He wasn’t joking. Jimbo don’t scare easy.

The air felt… wrong.

The lights started acting strange after that.

You hear stories, growing up here. How the northern lights are the spirits of the dead. That you should never whistle at them or wave, or they'll come down and take you with them. I always thought that was just stuff my grandma said to keep me from playing outside too late. But then one night, I looked up, and they were… pulsing. Not like normal. Not pretty or gentle. These ones twisted, seethed, like something alive. They weren’t green. They were red. Blood red, like an open wound across the sky.

And I swear to God, I heard something whisper my name.

That was the first time I dreamed of the thing. It stood just past the treeline behind my cabin. Seven feet tall. Blacker than shadow. Its arms were too long, and its eyes didn’t glow, they *swallowed* light. No face. No sound. Just... there. Watching. When I woke up, there were footprints in the snow. Big ones. Leading up to my window, then stopping.

I told myself it was a moose. A weird dream. Some dumb coincidence.

But I didn’t sleep the next night.

We’re Gwich’in here. At least, most of us. My family too, though we’ve got some Koyukon in our blood, way back. This land, it’s ours—not just because we live here, but because it remembers us. Our stories are written in the rivers, in the bones buried beneath the permafrost. The ancestors are supposed to watch over us. Guide us.

But lately it feels like they’ve turned their backs.

And then Isaiah’s cabin caught fire. No one saw it happen. Just smoke in the morning and ash by noon. No body found. No tracks. Just scorched earth and twisted timber. Folks said he probably left town. Took a lantern with him and knocked something over. But I know Isaiah. The man could barely walk. He wouldn't have gone anywhere.

After that, more people started disappearing. Not in crowds. Just one by one. Like the lights would reach a little lower each night, and someone would vanish.

No one talked about it. Not directly. But you could feel it—like the whole village was holding its breath. Doors locked earlier. Radios went silent. Everyone was *watching* the sky.

And I...

I started seeing things. Shapes. Movements in the trees. Reflections in the windows that weren’t mine. My own shadow stretching longer than it should. The lights got *inside*. Not the house. Inside *me*.

The elders used to talk about things—not to be spoken of after dark. Stories about creatures that live between worlds. The ones that come in winter, when the light hangs in the sky and the snow deadens all sound. My grandma used to say there were places the spirits never stopped walking, places too old and too quiet for us to understand. I never believed in those stories until now.

Old Annie, one of the last true matriarchs in the village, started talking nonsense. Said she saw something with bone antlers and a stitched mouth walking along the ridgeline. She said it wore the skins of people it took. She said it mimicked voices, calling from the woods in the tones of lost loved ones. A trickster spirit. A hunter.

We didn’t believe her.

She froze to death on her porch the next night. Sitting straight up, eyes open, mouth slack like she’d seen God and He’d walked past without noticing her.

After that, some of the Gwich’in packed up. Said they were heading Outside, or down to stay with relatives in some other village. The old ways said to leave when the spirits get thick in the air. When the dogs refuse to go outside, and the ravens stop circling. I wanted to go too. But something kept me here.

Or maybe I just didn’t want to bring it with me.

It’s hard to explain the way the lights look now. They don’t shimmer. They crawl. Like they’re made of something solid, reaching down from the heavens. You stare too long and your thoughts turn inside out. You start remembering things you never lived. Blood in the snow. Screams that don’t belong to anyone you know. You forget where you are.

One night I heard my dad’s voice outside the cabin. He’s been dead ten years.

“Open up, boy,” he said. Just like he used to when he’d get home from hunting. “It’s cold as a witch’s tit out here.”

I almost opened the door. Almost.

Then I saw the shadow pass the window.

It wasn’t him.

Now it’s just me. Everyone’s gone. Or dead. I don’t know anymore.

The general store’s empty. The generator blew two nights ago. The river’s frozen stiff. No snowmachines. No dogs. No one.

I’m holed up in the old garage cabin now. Mine was too close to the treeline. Too exposed. I’ve boarded the windows. I’ve blocked the chimney. I haven’t seen the stars in days—just the lights. Always the lights.

It stands outside now. I see it every night. Just past the tree line. Antlers scraped raw. Eyes like holes in the world. Waiting. Watching.

Sometimes I think it is the lights. Or that the lights are just the smoke it gives off. The radiation of its mind burning through the sky.

I don’t sleep anymore. I don’t eat much. I keep this computer warm in my sleeping bag just so I can write. Just so someone might know what happened here. Maybe if the next person reads this, they won’t make the same mistakes. Maybe they won’t whistle at the lights.

They never tell you that madness is gentle at first.

Just a flicker.

A whisper.

Please just hear me out. For context, I(22f) am 7 years younger than the next youngest member of my extended family. After me it breaks into my cousins(age ranges30-40) children(newborn-13). My cousins have always had a difficult time seeing me as a person after I started reaching a more mature age. Because of this, I have dealt with a lot of depression and feelings of ostrisization. My sister(34f) has dealt with similar feelings, except the cause of which are unknown. My cousins has excluded my sister and I for as long as we can remember, and all have an excellent relationship separate from us two. My recent sister in law(30f take a year or two) who has been in our family now for 5ish years roughly, has also begun to be excluded. 

Now to the story, my cousin who is getting married(30f) has included all of my female cousins with the exception of one girl who was just married in this past summer, and my sisters and myself. All of the other girl cousins have been asked to be in the wedding party. My sisters, mother, and I have had a hard time coming to terms and accepting this without our feelings being hurt. She asked cousins to be included that she isn’t close with at all? So why not us? I understand that it is her wedding. I would never want to ruin it in any way, shape, or form. I’m not vindictive, I’m not vengeful, but I feel a sense of deep sadness and rejection, after what I thought was a bit of a make up period between me and my cousins(her specifically) this past Christmas. My aunt knows that I have had a hard time with this, but yet continues to ask me to help out with the wedding in ways that feel like a pity job. Like, great, my sister and mother and I get to man the coffee counter and make espresso’s and lattes for everyone while the rest of my cousins, aunts, get to dance it up having fun in the bridal party. I get stuck having to set up the bridal shower while they have fun on their bachelorette. Do you see where I’m going with this? I’ve been asked to do what feels like the dirty work, pity jobs. Like I am just seen as hands. I have told my aunt that I will get back to her on these “jobs”, because right now I’m not even sure if I can handle attending this wedding without years of family trauma unloading and it potentially ruining her wedding. I don’t want to do that. I genuinely just want to know if I am being over emotional over this, or if my feelings are justified.

Thank you guys for your honesty.

It’s basically an environment where you’re not allowed to make a mistake which I’ve never experienced in the service industry before. Like, working in a coffee shop, a few times a day someone’s drink might need to be remade for whatever reason and I’ve never worked in a place where management cares. These things just happen when you’ve got several people making hundreds of drinks a day. But this manager will vaguely threaten our jobs if even one customer is unhappy with their drink. She’ll interrogate us trying to find out which one of us made it. It’s just a bizarrely oppressive, fear driven place to work and I wanted out almost immediately, but I have a tendency to be reactive and I told myself to try to hold on until I could find another job. I managed to get hired at a different location in the same company (honestly, I would rather get out of the company altogether, but I just wanted to get out of this location as soon as possible) and immediately put in my notice at my current location. I just found out that the transfer fell through, but I’ve already made up my mind that I have to get out of the current job. My issue is that, like I said, I tend to be reactive with things like this. All of my co workers hate working there too, but they’re able to suck it up and work through it which makes me feel immature for not being able to do the same.

1jttmfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/1jttmfj/something_to_remember/,Something to Remember,"Reddit is an echo chamber. Unions *can* be good, but they are incredibly unpopular in some cases for good reason. Alot of you undergrads are now learning the hard way why exactly that is. I’m sorry that your grades and future options, options that these grad students have already secured and had once hoped for, will have to ultimately pay the price. This is especially true for law, med, and MBA hopefuls (among others) compared to the substantially easier (to get into, at least, i won’t claim to know their workload) graduate programs that, unfortunately, the individuals striking are in. They (for the most part) never needed the grades as badly as the students I mentioned earlier do.

PSAC loves to say “undergrad students suffering is not our problem” or “the university should be the ones caring not us” or “we don’t care how the strike impacts them, because we are being exploited.” Take a page out of their book then. If this is the world we live in, then why the fuck should you care whether they get paid shit wages or decent wages or if they scab or if they had coffee this morning? 

Yes striking at a time like this gives you the most leverage, but post-secondary institutions don’t exist in a vaccuum. The actions they are taking, even if it is the case that they are being treated unfairly, disproportionately impact YOU, the undergrads. Don’t forget that. Picketing in front of Grant Hall during exams and then turning around and making a graphic that says they aren’t targeting exams doesn’t magically make it true. They care more about their stupid demands (demands no other higher education students make or get) than the expense at which it comes (your future prospects). 

Should the university be the ones caring? Yes. Have they refused to come back to the table? I think so. Are they the ones caring? No, which sucks. Has PSAC made some incredibly stupid demands? Yes. Does any of that fucking matter? No, because you undergrads are the only ones who will pay the price.

Again, to those hoping to pursue a professional degree after undergrad: generally, those currently striking never needed the grades that you did to get to where they are right now in their lives. I know people who failed classes who are doing their masters degrees in social science/arts/idk the right word but you know what i mean. The same does not hold true for you, or for those who will unfortunately have to live with CR or GD on their transcript.

1jttkh7,https://v.redd.it/x42ahpr8pgte1,How does the drying method affect coffee flavor?,"Drying is one of the most important steps when it comes to the final quality of coffee. It doesn’t matter how great your variety is or how well you fermented it—if drying goes wrong, the cup will show it.

From my own experience on the farm, I’ve tried different drying methods, and each one gives different results depending on the context.

Sun drying:
This is the most traditional method, but there are many ways to do it:

Raised beds (African beds): These allow for good airflow, which is great for natural and honey processes. If you keep the layer thin and rotate the coffee often, it gives you clean, sweet, and well-balanced flavors.

In greenhouses (parabolic dryers): The plastic cover helps keep temperatures more stable and protects from rain—perfect for humid areas.

On patios: Mostly used for bigger batches. You have to be careful with heat buildup and rotate frequently to avoid over-fermentation or mold.

Solar tunnels: Similar to greenhouses but more closed in. They hold heat better and speed up drying, though you need to monitor temps closely.


Mechanical drying (like guardiolas):
These machines give you more control, especially when the weather doesn’t help. If you keep the temperature low (around 35–45°C / 95–113°F), you can preserve sweetness and clarity. But if the heat gets too high, it can “cook” the coffee and flatten the profile. I usually use it as a backup when the sun isn’t enough.

Dark room drying:
This has been one of the biggest surprises for me. It’s not very common yet, but it’s gaining attention because of how it improves cup quality.
Drying the coffee in a room with no direct light, stable temperatures, and controlled airflow leads to a slower, more even drying process.
The result? More complexity, stronger sweetness, fruity notes, and a cup that holds up better over time. It does take more care and time, but it’s totally worth it—especially for small special lots.

No matter which method you use, the goal is to reach a moisture level between 10% and 12%. That helps protect the coffee from mold or quality loss during storage.

Of course, a lot of other things matter too—like altitude, variety, climate, humidity, type of process, bed design, and farm management. But drying really does play a big role in the final flavor.

Every year for her birthday, she requested we all fly in to a destination near her, stay in an AirBNB of her choosing for 3+ days, and go out to eat for every meal (plus drinks, coffee and deserts at seperate places) at all places of her choosing. The food/drinks expected budget was $250-$300 daily. She would also heavily hint that she wanted us to buy a specific drink or a specific item of clothing or souvenir so we could all take pictures with the matching item.

We each paid for our own flights, our own food/drink, our own souvenirs/shopping and we split the AirBNB equally among everyone. She typically drove to the destinations from her home, so we sometimes used her car, but we each chipped in for gas equally. Everything was basically split equally, but should I have offered to cover some of her expenses too because it was her birthday?

I would typically spend $3,000+ on these trips, and I was becoming resentful. She felt I was being really cheap when I tried to steer us to cheaper hotels/AirBNBs and asked if we could go grocery shopping or get street food for some meals. Instead, I opted to decline to buy drinks sometimes, and didn't do much shopping. She has since gone on to tell people one of the reasons we fell out is because I was really cheap and I ""ruined"" her birthdays.

Is this how friends' trips are done typically? Is it rude to decline to buy drinks, specific food items or shop while on a group trip? I feel like she may have been unreasonable, but she is telling other people that I'm cheap. Am I?

I grabbed a general ticket to Amritsar. I was waiting for my next train to Amritsar and it was raining and the cold wind was blowing at the station and it was 3 at night so there were not much options on the station still managed to grab a good coffee.

I checked the route and thought I should leave the train at Jalandhar and catch the next train coming behind as I will get a place to atleast sit till Jalandhar coz I don't know if the next train will have place to sit or not. 
I reached Jalandhar cantt and was chilling at the platform, went out of station grabbed a coffee and came back to platform to check when is the next train coming and on what platform, the station was was going under construction so there were no display boards so again went to the main entrance and I was shocked that ajmer express was not on the board then I again checked my phone and it was showing that the train will be there by half an hour , again checked the display board but no display of my train and then I just realised what a big goof-up I have made, ajmer express was coming at Jalandhar City and I was waiting at Jalandhar cantt.

""S'posed to be every three years, right? Coulda sworn it was only last year we did it.""

Luke nodded. ""Now it's every year. Thanks everyone, I'll get your records updated and we'll have all the boxes ticked by the time we get to the jump point this evening.""

""God, this has to be some sort of record. Four hours is obscene."" Mel groaned.

""Complaining about it won't make it go any faster."" Luke shot back.

Scott said nothing, his foot tapping away on the deck.

Frustrations were starting to show. New security procedures, customs checks and border enforcement were like the latest fad; and traffic was a mess. Over twenty ships sat waiting to transit with more arriving every hour, being slowly cleared by customs and patrol craft shuttling around like bees collecting pollen. Big, fat, incredibly slow bees with clipboards.

Cargo manifest checks. Then food contamination checks. Radiation sweep. Background checks, destination clearance, license validation, stowaway screening, *cultural assurance checks(?!)*, and next, *finally*, transit clearance.

""Whole damn galaxy goin' mad."" Scott muttered.

Luke shrugged. ""Maybe there was another attack, or something else happened. We've been in the dark two weeks - we don't know. Like I said - I don't want to risk holding us up any longer here; let's get through this and see if the transit station can do a data sync when we arrive.""

Mel pointed at the small yellow square lighting up on the console. ""There.""

Luke tapped his comm. ""Here we go everyone, wait's over. Strap yourselves in if you need to."" He tapped again to deactivate it. ""Need a sick bag, Scott?"" he asked, deadpan. Melanie smirked.

Scott shook his head, carefully navigating the ship into position. ""Ya make one mistake...""

*The Eventide* moved carefully into transit position, between two small cargo craft. Luke glanced briefly to port, drawn by the motion in the bright cockpit. Another human pilot; not incredibly rare but noteworthy enough for a smile and a small wave. He returned the gesture before strapping himself in.

Scott freed the controls and double checked his straps, staring at the blinking amber light. Once all ships were in position, it would turn green and they'd be quietly transported fifty-thousand times the distance they'd travelled in the past ten days. No matter how many times he did it, he couldn't help but hold his breath when that little light turned green. He tapped the console, looping everyone in the cockpit into station communications.

Melanie shook herself loose, like she was getting ready to step into a boxing ring, letting her hands rest on her legs.

Luke mentally crossed his fingers.

They sat in silence, and a minute later, the light turned Green.

""All ships clear...""

Tiny flashes danced in Scott's vision. The hairs on his arms stood on end, a reminder of the immense power the station was silently radiating.

""...cancelled! Repeat-""

Everything blinked out of existence for a brief moment. The only sound was the quiet ticking and clanging of the hull; metal returning to its original shape. Scott had the sensation of looking through someone else's eyes, like his consciousness hiccupped and then caught up with itself, while his body stayed perfectly still. He fought the sensation of nausea and set to work checking their status on the console. Everything looked good; he just had to wait for the traffic coordinator. They'd arrived safely.

Silence permeated the cockpit as everyone gathered themselves, broken by a quiet sound. Scott tilted his head to listen. Was that...sand? Like someone pouring out a bag of sugar. He looked out.

A mid-sized cargo vessel, but something didn't look right. It was...twisting? He wasn't sure. He squinted.

An orange plume erupted silently from its aft port side, accelerating it slightly. It was awkwardly tilting, forwards and sideways. Another silent plume sent it twirling faster. He blinked and squinted harder, trying to make sense of it. Was that...? Legs, two arms...and there was that sound again - sand. He looked to Luke.

Luke was looking out to the port side, mouth slightly open. Scott followed his gaze. The small cargo ship with the human pilot, should be...

There. A massive, torn slab of twisted hull plating was wedged firmly into its darkened cockpit. It was pitching slightly downwards. Scott frowned, not quite understanding. He blinked, trying to get the images back to the way they were. His body was moving, but he wasn't moving it. His ear hurt - someone was yelling into it.

""-US THE HELL OUT OF HERE!"" Mel screamed at him.

He turned his head to look at her. She was wide-eyed. Furious? Terrified? She was shaking him, really hard. He looked back to the console. That was a lot of red and yellow. His hands hovered, quivering. He wasn't supposed to move without clearance. A flash of light made him look up again.

The twisting ship was in two pieces now - one of them looked like it might graze them. Sand. Yelling. Bodies spilling out like a split bag of dolls. His hands looked strange.

""-FUCKING CHRIST-"" Mel stabbed at the console. He watched her fingers move. *The Eventide* started pitching down.

That was it. His hands came to life, slapping Mel's aside. She looked like she was going to punch him out of the chair, until she saw him working the controls again. She unclenched her fists but kept her eyes on him.

Find a spot, radially away, avoiding traffic...there. He pointed *The Eventide's* nose where he wanted her to go. A loud scraping, crunching noise nudged it back in the opposite direction, jostling the cockpit.

""Shit,"" he cursed, ""wasn't me."" he said out loud. The environmental panel started flashing yellow in the corner of his eye. He ignored it, turning the nose again. Another scraping noise nudged it back again. ""Fuck it."" he pressed the button for the rear thrusters, pushing them away from whatever they were snagged on. No time for protocol. The scraping and grinding metal noise became worse, briefly, then stopped. He nudged the thruster power up, eyes flicking wildly back and forth between the local space display and the cockpit window.

Mel took her eyes off Scott to check on Luke. He was sitting motionless, staring out to port, his face completely white. She tapped her comm.

""Gordon, Katie, check in.""

""What the hell is going on?!"" She winced at Gordon's yell, but ignored him for now.

She waited. ""Katie?""

Silence.

""Gordon, there's been some kind of accident. Check on Katie and then-"" she glanced at the environmental panel.

*Warning: Crew Cabin #4.*

""-SHIT! Go get Katie, get your breather FIRST - and a patch kit!""

She glanced at Scott, and then the console. They were moving safely away.

""You good?"" she asked him, suspiciously.

He nodded quietly, wiping his face with his hand, his eyes still flicking wildly between the consoles.

She unstrapped herself, grabbing Luke by the shoulder. ""Hey. Hey!""

Luke looked like he was starting to pull himself together. ""Uh. Yes. Okay.""

He'd be better off staying here. ""Keep an eye on him."" she said, pointing at Scott. She didn't wait, turning to jog quickly down the corridor, grabbing an emergency breather on her way. She pressed it against her face and pulled the straps tight behind her head as she jogged.

Gordon was already at the door when she arrived.

""Jammed!"" he said, voice muffled through his mask.

She looked up. The bulkhead above them was twisted out of shape, forcing the doorframe down against the door. She swallowed nervously. If the outer panel was gone, this corridor had been about a quarter inch of metal away from being completely decompressed. The door had buckled slightly, leaving a gap at the bottom. That was good - if there was a gap, air could flow.

Gordon swiftly disassembled the bottom frame and they wedged a bar in, viciously pulling the door out and letting it clatter into the corridor.

Mel looked inside. The faint smell of burning leaked into her breather, but there was no smoke, and no lights. She banged the doorframe with the bar.

""Katie?"" she yelled, yanking her mask off.

Gordon shone a torch in. Most of the ceiling was on the deck, in pieces, the entire room shorted out and covered in pieces of metal and plastic. No comms, no air flow, no light. Katie was huddled in the corner, curled up with her knees to her chest, covering her ears, terrified and shivering. There was a small cut on her head but not much blood.

""Katie?"" she tried, tentatively. She pressed Gordon's torch down a touch, so it wasn't shining in her eyes. ""It's me, Melanie.""

Katie blinked, sniffling and crying. She buried her face in her knees, sobbing in a mix of frustration and relief.

Melanie stepped carefully inside, picking her way across the room. She carefully shoved a chunk of ceiling aside and reached out her hand to help her up.

Katie gratefully hugged her tight, crying quietly.

""I thought-"" she caught herself and burst into tears.

\*\*\*

The mess hall was quiet, aside from the sound of Scott's heel bouncing quietly on the deck, bristling like he was raring to go. He kept shifting between sitting up and leaning forwards, unable to stay still.

Gordon was cleaning Katie's cut. Her eyes were still bloodshot and her ears were almost flat against her head, but physically she was fine.

Melanie was talking to Luke - he'd recovered enough from the shock to start planning again. *The Eventide* would sit tight and wait for one of the station's service shuttles to give them an all clear, or if that took too long Gordon would have to go out and check over their hull. They weren't in any rush; Luke would have need to talk to the station security, and file an insurance claim, and they have to submit, logs, statements - none of that was high on anybody's list of priorities right now.

Scott stood up to get another coffee. Luke caught Melanie staring nervously at him, and made to intercept. He didn't feel great about how he'd handled himself - but dwelling on it wouldn't help. The least he could do was let Melanie have some breathing space and help Scott get a grip on himself.

""William.""

Scott glowered at him for a moment, and then....just, seemed to deflate.

""Aye. Aye,"" he nodded, ""ah know."" He put the mug down, still holding onto the handle. He stared at the counter.

Luke didn't press any further, but he'd thought about what might help and Scott looked like he needed something to do.

""Can you do me - us - a favour, when you're ready?"" he asked.

He didn't look up. ""Aye.""

""Can you see...try to find out what happened? Maybe a news packet or a data sync? Nothing...graphic. No rush."" Luke put a hand on his shoulder.

Scott nodded. ""Good idea, Cap."" he put the mug down and set off straight away.",9,1744052981.0,HFY,4,0.92,False

1jttcky,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimLounge/comments/1jttcky/online_haram_relationship_confusion_and_guilt/,"online haram ""relationship""  - confusion and guilt","Salaam, my brothers and sisters in Islam, I wanted to ask for any possible duas/advice that would be suitable for my situation because I am so lost after getting blocked by a haram “relationship”. 

I posted on tiktok, and a guy commented under my post to refrain from using music and avoid music, and I went on his account and liked his content (he gave dawah and duas) and liked 1 or 2 of his posts, idk if he took it as a sign of interest bc he then started liking my posts after I would post too, (we didn't follow each other and i'm not a popular tik toker, i've only posted my face once which is where he found my tiktok from because it went a little viral). 

My content was scenery, goals, and coffee- just for fun. Eventually we followed each other on tiktok and started talking. I asked him what his intentions were for talking to me and he said marriage, and I told him I need time to get to know him but that we’re both on the same page. We constantly talked for very little days, and he gave me signs of attachment. 

But I didn’t need to talk everyday, to avoid further haram, and he didn’t reach out either, so after we ended a conversation one night, we did not talk for three days (especially because I had exams), and I checked after those three days and I had gotten blocked by him. This led to confusion and hurt, that am I not even worth an explanation? I thought how could he be the one to set such a huge intention and then BLOCK ME without even explaining why. It led to thoughts of what trait I could lack that one could just set such a serious intention and then block me without explaining. Was I being toyed with, or was it a fault within me? 

I genuinely liked him but I would've been much less hurt if he changed his mind and told me why instead of just blocking. Anyways, two months later, aka now, he had posted a story on his instagram after making it public, and although we exchanged instas we never followed each other. Ofc i was curious so from my spam account that doesn't say my name or trace back to me, i viewed the story. Immediately, he texted my acc asking who I am, assuming that I am a prank caller bc apparently he was trying to catch some girls prank calling him. 

I convinced him I am not the prank caller and it took a while because he kept questioning, then we started talking again for two days straight. He had many questions about who I am and jokingly bantered too. I thought he knew I was a girl, but turns out he didn't. After we established I am a girl, he continued bantering for like five minutes and even continuously asking my age which I thought was a little odd but then he said “we can't be talking then if you're a girl.” 

We said our salams and he blocked me, which is what I wanted because that automatically blocks my other accounts so I don’t search him up. Then, I changed my ig account name to where we talked, to my name. Few minutes later, he deactivated. Then it hit me that it wasn't a fault in me that he blocked me, but a greatness in him. It was his trust in Allah swt and closeness to Him that made him block me, and now probably feels guilty for talking to a girl and deactivated as a break. I feel horrible now, because I feel like I caused him religious guilt not meaning to, and now the guilt from THAT and the fact that I talked to him in itself is eating me up. 

I do not talk to men even when they have intentions for marriage, but I only reciprocated interest in him, completely online. However, haram is haram and I must admit I sinned by talking to the opposite gender, and influenced him to it. I will not reach out to him again though I am sorry.  I always pray for a future partner like this one, who doesn’t talk to women and I do the same, however I faltered this time. My heart feels heavy and filled with guilt for not trusting Allah swt enough and just so many other unexplainable feelings. 

I have no idea what to do, how to cope, if anyone has any similar experience, duas, ayahs, or advice, I would love to read it and am hoping for your responses.",3,1744052675.0,MuslimLounge,2,1.0,False

* Also looking at the **De'Longhi smart coffee maker** to handle my morning brew without me lifting a finger.

I did it in the least expensive way possible by using cheap items or items I have several copies of. The plot was also one where the tasks were done during a sandy suburbs quest (just expanded it without demolishing it). 

It’s got:
- Two rooms for the crafting challenge with 8 total stations. 
- Rooms with fashion studios, quilting kits, and woodworking benches for hobby events. 
- Rooms with multiples of 3 star sinks, phones, dining chairs, and couches. 
- Room for the cooking hobby with 3 star stoves (can also use for events)
- Garden plots. 
- As many 3 star trees as I could squeeze in (put some on the rooftop). 
- Plenty of singing fish around the building. 
- Some rooms that aren’t really needed for any events but just to make the building feel more liveable - a male and female bedroom with bunkbeds and attached bathrooms, small kitchen with fridge, coffee machine, and tea set, reception, locker room, 4 more general use toilets across 2 floors, recreational room with a table tennis table, couch, stereo, and TV, and a rooftop bar with seating. 

All remaining event items are in another house which is my second activity house. It’s actually less organised, lol.

Whether you're sipping coffee on a Sunday morning, hosting a movie night, or just chilling after a long day, this space needs to feel right. And that all starts with smart furniture choices.

We’re talking **mid-century modern furniture** that isn’t just stylish, but actually works for your lifestyle. If you’re wondering how to make your space feel warm, inviting, and still super practical, here’s a breakdown from someone who *gets* it.

[Agora Solid Wood Coffee Table from Mid in Mod](https://preview.redd.it/ohel6wsamgte1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8198058a0933e9a8fd228d8a9d2658dc308bcc6)

# The Coffee Table Is Your Anchor—Don’t Sleep On It

People underestimate how much a **coffee table** can shift the whole vibe of a room. Too big? It overwhelms the space. Too small? It feels off. The trick is to find something that matches your room’s flow.

* If your space is on the smaller side, go for a round or oval shape—it softens up the room.  
* Bigger living rooms can handle bold, rectangular tables that balance everything out.  

And let’s not forget about materials. Wood gives that cozy, natural touch. Glass and metal feel more sleek and modern. The **Agora Solid Wood Coffee Table** from **Mid in Mod** hits that sweet spot—clean lines, warm tones, and just enough personality to make people ask, “Where’d you get that?”

# Sofa or Sectional? It’s All About How You Live

Here’s the thing: there’s no “right” answer. It really comes down to how you use your space.

* **Sofas** are perfect for smaller rooms or for those who like to mix things up with chairs, ottomans, or side tables. They're easier to rearrange, and they leave room to breathe.  
* **Sectionals** shine in bigger rooms and for folks who host a lot. More seating = more hangouts.  

Two standouts from **Mid in Mod**:

* The **Delano Olive Green Velvet Sectional Sofa**—soft, cozy, and super stylish. It’s one of those **velvet sofas** that just makes the whole room feel intentional.  
* The **Vista Beige Leather Japandi Sofa** is for the minimalist at heart. Clean edges, muted tones, and that calming feel that only a good **leather modern couch** can bring.

# Want Your Bookshelves to Look Pinterest-Worthy? Here's How

Bookshelves aren’t just for books anymore. They’re your chance to show off your style—without going overboard.

* Mix books with personal items like photos, little plants, or travel keepsakes.  
* Add different textures—maybe some wood, ceramic, glass—to make it more interesting.  
* Stick to a color palette, but don’t be afraid to pop in something bold here and there.  

If you need a solid piece to bring it all together, the **Robins Credenza Walnut TV Stand** looks amazing next to a bookshelf. It’s clean, minimal, and brings balance to any setup.

# Fall in Love with Mid-Century Modern Style (If You Haven’t Already)

If you’ve been eyeing that **mid-century modern furniture** aesthetic, now’s the time to dive in. It’s timeless, practical, and fits just about any vibe—from clean and simple to fun and eclectic.

These pieces aren’t trendy—they’re forever. Think warm woods, functional shapes, and furniture that makes sense without trying too hard. The Agora coffee table is a great place to start, and if you want to build a whole look, try pairing it with a comfy sectional or even something like the **Abbott Dining Chair**, which totally nails that classic silhouette with modern comfort.

The city was still stretching its limbs, and I found myself nursing a lukewarm coffee at a small café on 6th and Dumas. The kind of place that served espresso with self-righteousness and tiny spoons you weren’t supposed to use.

He walked in just as I was about to leave. My best friend from school, Ricky Castellanos. Same shaggy mop of hair, same grin that looked like it owed somebody money. We hadn’t seen each other in years. I’d assumed he was dead.

“Holy shit,” he said, pointing at me like I was a celebrity caught in a scandal. “I thought you were dead.”

“Same thing,” I replied, and we hugged the way grown men do—briefly, hard, and with an unspoken agreement not to make it last too long.

We sat. We ordered. He got a double macchiato with oat milk, like a man who’s never been punched in the face, and I stuck with regular coffee because I still believe in the power of bitterness.

Within minutes, he was knee-deep in nostalgia, dragging out memories I’d buried with intent. His voice took on that sing-songy rhythm it always did when he was about to romanticize our delinquency.

“Do you remember those days?” he asked, eyes gleaming. “We used to smoke pot in the bathroom like it was a goddamn temple.”

I nodded, half-smiling, half-regretting the entire encounter.

“And man, the girls…” he said, waggling his eyebrows like a sleazy cartoon wolf. “We’d finger hot girls at recess behind the gym. You remember Tiffany? Tight jeans, loose morals?”

“Vaguely,” I muttered.

“And that nerd—what was his name?” Ricky snapped his fingers. “Bryce! Poor bastard. Did all our work like a little unpaid intern with no boundaries.”

“Because we told him we’d put him in a locker if he didn’t,” I said. “Which we did anyway.”

Ricky laughed. “Yeah, but look at him now. CEO of something. Probably writes his employees up for using Comic Sans.”

I looked at him. Really looked. His eyes were tired around the edges, but his face hadn’t aged a day. Still youthful, still reckless, still floating in a memory like it was enough to keep him warm.

I stirred my coffee and said nothing. Truth was, I hadn’t thought about those years in ages. They felt like another life. And truth be told, I never wanted to be one of those sad, retired men constantly reminiscing about the past.

But as Ricky kept talking, as the sun moved behind a slow cloud and the waitress refilled our cups without asking, something inside me shifted. Not an epiphany. More like a mild concussion of the soul.

He wasn’t wrong.

We had smoked pot in the bathrooms. We had touched girls in places and at times that would make a guidance counselor cry. And we had bullied our way through that school like we were owed the world.

And maybe—just maybe—that wasn’t the worst version of myself.

I sipped my coffee and looked at Ricky, still mid-rant about a girl who once gave him head.

He was right. Those were the greatest days.  
There was no point in denying it. I was one of those sad, retired men.  
And I really missed being a teacher.",1,1744052115.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

The Biggest Modern Dating Problems Explained,"About a month ago, I took on a new client. In our first meeting, asked me, “*Why is dating so hard? Why can I not find a partner? How did it get this bad?*” Despite being a real catch, she’d been single for years. She truly could not understand if dating was just this hard for *her,* or if all singles were bearing the unbelievable weight of modern dating challenges. 

The truth is that most singles are struggling to find love. They’ve either been ghosted too many times, are burnt out of dating apps, or are exhausted by situationships and no-strings-attached flings. These modern dating challenges are leading to fewer and fewer relationships. In fact, [over half of US singles say they aren’t looking for love](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2023/02/13/for-valentines-day-5-survey-findings-about-singles-from-pew-research/)!

The biggest reason? Dating has *changed*. We’re navigating a very different landscape than our parents did. The dating rules change every day, new trends pop up overnight, swiping and liking dominate the landscape, and the culture prioritizes instant gratification over deep connection. It’s really no wonder why so many singles have checked out of dating altogether. 

But here’s the good news: Not everyone has given up on romance. Yes, finding true love is difficult right now, but it’s still attainable. Once you understand the biggest modern dating challenges, it becomes easier to see what’s holding you back and how to thrive in our current dating scene. 

Having been a matchmaker for over two decades, I know a thing or two about love, dating, and romance. If you’re ready to answer, “*Why is dating so hard?”,* this blog is for you. I’ll dive into the emotional and cultural shifts behind our dating landscape and give you some viable strategies that can help you find a loving, lasting relationship. 

# The Biggest Modern Dating Challenges

**The Paradox Of Choice**

Dating apps give us access to more potential partners than we could ever date, but instead of making the search for love *easier*, it actually does the opposite. With seemingly endless options at our fingertips, we just keep swiping, thinking, “*What if there’s someone better just a profile away?*” This paradox of choice makes it harder to commit to any one person, even when someone great is right in front of us. 

In a series of studies, researchers found that people became [27% less likely to swipe right on potential partners the longer they spent online dating](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335312368_A_Rejection_Mind-Set_Choice_Overload_in_Online_Dating#:~:text=Across%20three%20studies%2C%20participants%20immediately,to%20the%20last%20partner%20option.). This suggests that the more we swipe, the pickier we become. We’re constantly on the hunt, but rarely satisfied with our options. Quite literally, the fabric of modern dating encourages us to keep looking instead of investing in a relationship. 

**Swipe Fatigue And Burnout** 

Many of my past clients have compared dating apps to another full-time job. The cycle of perpetual swiping, awkward DMs, and ghosting really takes a toll. Sure, it can feel exciting at first, but it usually turns into a self-esteem-destroying loop that leaves you feeling more alone than before you started. The swiping cycle and eventual burnout are arguably some of the biggest modern dating challenges we face.

According to a Forbes Heath poll, over [78% of dating app users feel emotionally, mentally, or physically exhausted by them](https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/dating-app-fatigue/). That statistic shows just how exhausting dating apps are. And while online dating platforms are designed to keep you swiping, they aren’t necessarily built to help you leave the platform with a real relationship. 

**Ghosting, Breadcrumbing, And Mixed Signals**

If you feel like no one bothers to communicate anymore, you’d be mostly correct: poor (if any) communication has been normalized in the modern dating scene. Ghosting and breadcrumbing are on the rise, making it even harder to build trust with someone new. According to another Forbes Health poll, over [60% of singles claim to have been ghosted before](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/modern-dating-mental-health/#:~:text=Results%20show%20that%20a%20staggering,doing%20all%20of%20this%20ghosting?). 

So if you’ve felt like the odds are stacked against you in dating, you unfortunately aren’t wrong. Basic respect, honesty, and emotional availability feel like rare qualities in our modern dating scene. It’s no wonder why so many people are jaded, guarded, and questioning, “*Why is dating so hard right now?*” 

**Unrealistic Expectations**

Social media is a double-edged sword: on one hand, it’s allowed us to connect with people across the globe, yet on the other, it’s also skewed our perception of what people actually look like in real life. So many singles are chasing a *moment* rather than a *person*. Every single selfie you see online is polished, filtered, and sometimes, even AI, yet we still pursue the same curated perfection we see online in the real world. 

Most recent studies show how [overuse of social media leads to decreased satisfaction in both dating and relationships](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-021-00658-0#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20results%2C%20there,depression%2C%20anxiety%2C%20and%20stress.). Really, social media leaves us stuck in a fantasy instead of grounded in reality. People who are chronically online tend to overlook great potential partners because they don’t fit into the narrative they’ve created in their social media echo chamber. 

**Fear of Rejection And Vulnerability**

One of the biggest modern dating challenges? Emotional detachment and fear of vulnerability. In our dating culture, hookups and casual flings are more normalized than ever before, making many singles afraid to open up. Real vulnerability requires risk, and laying your feelings out on the table feels like too much danger with too little returns.

Unfortunately, without vulnerability, there’s no chance for intimacy. And without intimacy, there’s no real relationship. Some studies even show how [emotional availability is even more important to relationship longevity and satisfaction than sexual chemistry.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5961442/)

# Why Is Dating So Hard Now?

**A Changing Landscape For How We Connect**

We live in a time where texting has replaced talking and many first impressions happen behind a screen. As I said, technology has made it easier to meet new people, but it hasn’t helped us truly connect with them. Meet-cutes and face-to-face conversations have all but faded into obscurity. 

Meeting someone through your friend or striking up a conversation with a cute barista at a coffee shop feels rare and even awkward now. But in reality, meeting people in the real world is still the best way to make connections. When we only meet people digitally, it’s impossible to build trust or chemistry. 

**Loneliness And Mental Health Struggles**

According to a recent Gallup Poll, [one in five Americans feel lonely *every single day*](https://news.gallup.com/poll/651881/daily-loneliness-afflicts-one-five.aspx#:~:text=Daily%20Loneliness%20Edges%20up%20to%2020%25%20of%20U.S.%20Adults&text=The%20most%20recent%20results%2C%20obtained,and%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia.). We’re quite literally in the midst of a loneliness epidemic with more and more people feeling disconnected. Of course, this epidemic disproportionately affects singles, driving more dating anxiety, burnout, and even desperation. 

Here’s the *real* issue: loneliness in dating often leads us to settle because people are choosing quick fixes for isolation instead of long-term compatibility. And when we end up in relationships that don’t truly serve us, it reinforces the idea that love is simply out of reach or impossible to find. 

**Overworked And Burnt Out**

Careers, side hustles, gym schedules, and parenting: you name it, we’re juggling it. Most singles are so busy trying to keep their lives afloat that dating becomes an afterthought or a frustrating waste of time. Seriously, when your job takes up 50+ hours a week, your home doesn’t clean itself, and you’re trying to maintain a semblance of a social life, how *do* you make time for dating?

And when you’re tired, distracted, and burned out, it’s nearly impossible to show up as your best self on a date. It’s even harder to actually invest in a new relationship with consistency and support. The truth is that people don’t need more *dates*, they need better, deeply intentional *connections*.  

**Dating Trends Are Ever-Changing**

In the past, there were clear, hard-and-fast rules around dating and relationships. There were no questions about who asks who out, when to call, and what each stage of dating looks like. Now, dating rules change like the weather. This does give way for more freedom and inclusivity, but it also creates a culture of deep dating confusion. 

Most singles wrack their brains wondering: *Should I text first? Am I being too forward? Are we exclusive or just talking?* This limbo of ambiguity is stressful, discouraging, and even hopeless, especially when people are dating with different intentions and goals. 

# How to Overcome Modern Dating Challenges

**Set Clear Intentions**

The quickest way to make dating easier? Know what you’re truly looking for, and don’t be afraid to say it up front! It doesn’t matter if you’re looking for something casual, a long-term relationship, or marriage, being honest about your goals will help you meet people who align with them. It also saves you time and energy by filtering out people who just aren’t on the same page. 

I get it; intentionality might not *sound* sexy, but in today’s dating scene, it’s actually one of the most attractive qualities you can have. Plus, you’ll save yourself and the people you date from heartache in the long run. 

**Prioritize Quality Over Quantity**

It’s easy to fall for the paradox of choice, thinking that more matches *must* equal more chances at love. But the truth is, five meaningful conversations are worth more than fifty “just okay” ones. My point is to be selective with your energy and only pursue connections that really have a chance. 

Give your time to singles who seem genuinely interested in getting to know you, communicate with you consistently, and are on the same page about relationship goals. Dating doesn’t have to be a numbers game! And really, when you play that game, you lose most of the time. 

**Take A Dating App Break**

If you constantly feel burned out, give yourself permission to step away. Just like with any other social media, constantly scrolling on dating apps will drain you emotionally and skew your perspective. Taking breaks allows you to recenter your mindset, reconnect with yourself, and come back to dating from a more grounded place. 

And after you’ve deleted your dating apps, really consider other ways to meet people. Don’t be afraid to use your friends and hobbies or even go to singles events to make new connections! 

**Don’t Be Afraid Of Vulnerability**

I know that it’s tempting to play it cool and pretend like no one matters to you, especially in a dating scene that encourages detachment. But if you want something *real*, you have to be willing to lay your cards out on the table. That means being honest about what you want, what you fear, and how you really feel, even if it’s terrifying. 

Yes, vulnerability is a risk. But it’s also the foundation for trust, intimacy, and real, lasting love. Without it, every connection you make will fizzle out. Vulnerability is what truly gives any relationship longevity.

**Focus On Yourself First**

Before you even start dating, you need to ask yourself: *Am I truly ready for a relationship? Do I have the bandwidth to invest in another person’s life and needs, and let them into mine in return?* So many singles rush into dating without actually considering whether they’re ready, which only creates a culture of situationships and mismatched intentions. 

If you do some soul-searching and find that you are *truly* ready for love, don’t settle for superficial connections or hookups. Only pursue people who are open, consistent, and communicate their intentions with you. 

**Work With A Professional Matchmaker**

If you’re done with dating apps, being ghosted, and second-guessing every move you make, matchmaking might be the best dating solution for you. Instead of leaving your love life to chance and simply wondering, *“Why is dating so hard for me?”*, a matchmaker can provide an intentional, deeply personal, and strategic way to find love. 

Matchmakers take the guesswork out of dating by deeply getting to know you and introducing you to the highest quality, pre-vetted matches that match your personality, values, and goals. It’s not just about convenience, it’s about being seen, heard, and understood by someone who genuinely wants to help you find lasting love. 

# Dating Isn’t Broken, But It Has Changed

Despite all of the modern dating challenges, finding love isn’t *impossible*. It’s just more complex than it used to be. From seemingly endless options to choose from, being burnt out of dating apps, and unclear expectations, it’s no wonder why so many singles feel lost. But here’s the good news: you don’t have to navigate it alone. With a more intentional approach, you can cut through the noise and find something real. 

If you’re ready to invest in your love life and have a professional to guide you every step of the way, a professional matchmaker might be the game changer your dating life needs. At LUMA, our mission is to help every single person find lasting love. We have matchmakers across the country, so no matter if you’re in [Dallas](https://lumasearch.com/dallas-tx/), [New York City](https://lumasearch.com/new-york-city-nyc/), [Chicago](https://lumasearch.com/chicago-il/), or anywhere else in the US, we can connect you with the most desirable singles in your area. ",1,1744051885.0,LUMAMatchmakingReview,0,1.0,False

I need to know if someone who has been diagnosed with MCAS can relate to my wild symptoms that no one can seem to figure out, and if there any tests I can bring up to my doctor to test for it. (I will not use replies as a means to self-diagnose I’m just looking for answers. And my doctor is ready to test for pretty much anything) 
So this all started last year. I won’t say all started but gotten much much worse. 
So basically I have unexplained hives that come at random times so I haven’t been able to find a potential trigger. Sudden (worsening) food intolerances, it seems to be more with carbs like breads/pastas. Sudden caffeine intolerance when I used to be a daily coffee drinker. Unexplained dizziness, chest pain, extra/skipped heartbeats. I have these be  dry weird episodes that can be triggered randomly and sometimes after eating said carbs. Inability for my body to regulate heart rate or blood pressure. My episodes feel like flushing (my whole face gets beat red along with my chest), sweating, always ends in severe diarrhea, sometimes vomiting always nausea, tunnel vision and feeling as if I’m going to pass out, anxiety, shakiness. Heart rate has been both normal and high on these episodes, blood pressure has also been high/normal/low during these episodes. And extreme fatigue and dizziness following these episodes that can either feel better the next day or last a couple of days to a few days. Sometimes I feel fine for a while but never for too long. 

I know this is a lot but I am going crazy living like this with no answers. It’s scary and debilitating. So many doctor visits/ER visits due to this to be told I’m fine and to see a therapist. (I have been seeing a therapist for years that also thinks that the anxiety is a symptom not the cause) so she won’t even prescribe anything else bc she doesn’t believe it’s just anxiety. 
Finally finding a doctor who is listening to me I would like to know what my next step should be if anyone knows. I had another really bad episode today and I am in tears just so over it. Any advice is appreciated. ",0,1744051733.0,MCAS,10,0.5,False

1jtswwc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jtswwc,Weekend Tasting Notes - Perc Coffee Time & Taste - Ethiopia Benti Neka,"My boyfriend and I spent Sunday Morning tasting the 3 bags of beans from Perc Coffee‘s time & Taste series. They send you the same beans with three different roast dates to taste how resting freshly roasted coffee impacts the flavor. The bundle came with three 4-oz bags (113.4g) which were roasted 3/31 (6 days), 3/18 (20 days) and 1/24/2025 ( 73 days) .


The Setup:


All beans were ground on a Timemore C2 at 15 clicks using an Aeropress with the current version of the flow control filter cap. I did a warm temp bloom with 50g water and brewed with a 1:15 ratio of 205F (96C) water. This is a slightly modified version of Wade Preston’s regular Aeropress cup from the 2018 US Brewers Cup qualifiers.  


The Results:

First, these beans are very nice. They smell beautifully of blueberry without it being too much and that flavor comes forward in the resulting brew.  

We found that the 3/31 beans were highly fruit forward with a sharp, almost bitter but not unpleasant finish. 3/18 beans were similarly fruity, but less bitter notes and more of the sweetness was coming out.  1/24 beans were losing their fruitiness, less sharp flavors, and now the finish was becoming a little more sour / tannic at the very end.


As they cooled the 3/31 seemed to have less blueberry flavor, was very smooth, but less complex than the 3/18 beans. 3/18 seemed to keep their abundance of flavors and sweetness. 1/24, while not a bad cup at all, was more flat in flavor profile - less brightness/sweetness/flavor overall. 


The Verdict: 

I preferred the 3/18 beans and my partner preferred the 3/31. The January was a lesson that we need to be going through our beans faster than we sometimes do.  


Some potential caveats - I don’t know how these beans were stored since the roasting and if storing them in different ways could improve longevity of the flavor notes.  For example, I’ve definitely noticed a difference in my beans after storing them in an Airscape container compared to me previously storing them in an Oxo container (has that small vac loc, but air is still in there).

Me  
Dear Husband (that's actually just my partner) 

MIL 

SFIL (step father in Law)

  
Context: 

2 Christmases ago, my SFIL gave me a slight verbal beat down in front of my DH, MIL, and DH's grandparents because I'm not a Tory (Conservative), it was a whole political thing. It wasn't him yelling at me, but he wasn't being.... nice either. 

Since then I took advice from this page to distance myself. This was great for me and my partner supported it because when I did visit the first two times, SFIL wouldn't make eye contact, wouldn't acknowledge I was there and MIL barely spoke to me. 

In doing so, I wasn't wished a happy holiday for anything at all over the last year, not even Easter, birthday, Christmas, etc., nothing. It even got to the point where DH's grandparents (MIL's parents) did separate days on Christmas so that we didn't all have to be together. Needless to say, my partner wasn't happy, I was confused and we had many conversations about what my DH was going to do because other things were going on between him and her and what was happening to me was just contributing to it. 

  
So now, a few weeks ago DH realized that since we are moving soon, there were a few financial things he needed to tie up so we could go into this chapter with the least amount of debt possible and one of those things was the seats for his Buick that he's restoring, which his mother had all the money saved for him because she had to take a loan for him, etc (confusing stuff) but he needed to talk to her and by this point, he was actively avoiding her, actively not telling her we where moving or where too as well. 

So he decided to have a sit down with her and sort their issues out. 

Me and I were on the same page, I did not want SFIL to come into my house and I wasn't keen on them knowing where the house was either. We were on the same page. But he made it clear, without asking me, that if the conversation went well, he was going to show her the house. 

When I said ''well can you at least ask me before you do'' 

He said ''well no offense, but it's MY mum'' 

That was nice of him. 

  
Here is my issue now, 

He has this chat with her, about 1.5 hours long, just those two as I made it clear from my own experiences, if it's just you two in public, she will listen better and not act like a fool. 

When he came home, he had decided without asking me, that we were all going to go out for coffee and ''repair'' the relationship (which to me translates to ''pretend it never happened''), she had seen the house and they were both welcome round once we'd settled. 

Not to mention that this conversation happened: 

DH ''I have opinions on SFIL as I'm sure you know, and I imagine you have issues too'' 

To which she agreed :) 

So now I'm a bit lost. I promised him I'd play nice and that if it went wrong it would be their fault, but I feel a bit unhappy (betrayed feels like too much) with how this has all happened. 

I'm not going to get an apology and I'm debating if it's even worth being bothered about that because it'll just cause drama, but allowing SFIL into my house.... I'm not happy about it. 

What do I do? And please don't tell me to leave him because I have already spoken to him about the rude manner he spoke to me, but not in-depth about how it makes me feel,  this is more about what do I do with this situation.

Why?

Because you just have to.

But I don't want to.

You have to try, my love.

Please, don’t call me that.

The world isn’t the same anymore, and you need to brace yourself for what’s ahead. If you keep trying to build with the old, crumbling bricks of yesterday, everything will fall apart, and you'll be buried beneath the ruins.

You always know what to say, don’t you?

She let out a soft, bittersweet chuckle. ""Baby, it's only fair. Let go of the rope... the water isn’t as cold as you think.""

“Alright,” I muttered, though every fiber of my being resisted.

As I stepped into the water, I found that she was right—the temperature was mild, almost welcoming, just as she had said. She was always right, always so damn sure of everything. She didn’t need glasses to prove she was smart; it radiated from her in ways that made you feel small, insignificant.

“I think it’s time to go home!” I yelled, the desperation clinging to my words.

But there was no response, just the quiet echo of my own voice mingling with the gentle lapping of the water. I looked around, searching for her, but she was gone, vanished like a ghost that had never been real to begin with. The warmth of the water suddenly felt like ice, creeping into my bones, chilling me to the core.

Home. The word felt hollow, meaningless. Without her, home was just a place—a collection of walls and memories that were slowly disintegrating, just like the bricks she had warned me about. I stood there, ankle-deep in the water, realizing that I was alone in every sense of the word, and the truth of it was suffocating. The rope had slipped from my hands, and now I was adrift, without her to anchor me.

I had to let go, but instead of relief, all I felt was the crushing weight of loss. I was tearing myself apart every day, if only I had her again, if I could relive the life, I once knew but I needn’t prose. The ropes indeed hang to keep us all awake, I should have known. Life just isn’t the same old song anymore.

If only we had lived together in a universe that had favored us. Maybe I just needed to feel the warmth of the sun again and so I did. I grabbed my keys and got in my car.

Outside, the world was beautiful, it was intricate and peaceful, the bustling sound of the traffic, children playing on the streets, it was refreshing for once. I decided to go for a cup of coffee, maybe it would freshen up my mind, bring me back to the world I once loved. I pulled up into the parking lot of the small autistic café in town. It was a cute place, the freshly baked coffee beans, crumbs of the croissants and donuts made me feel hungry and I was surprised too. It had been too long since I had enjoyed my meal.

“Hi, my name is Emily, how can I help you sir?”

The petite barista smiled at me, “Two large black coffees and one of those glazed donuts”

“That’ll be $4.99”

I used my card to pay, I hadn’t time to even withdraw cash from the ATM. I don’t need cash to where I’m going.

“Here’s your receipt sir, check the bottom!”

In my slumber, I hadn’t realized that she was flirting with me and had written her number on the bottom of the receipt, I smiled;

“Do you know how old I am?”

“She chuckled; I like older men”

“Maybe try again in another life” I said as I showed her my wedding ring.

“Aww shucks”

I waited in the brown leather booth in the far corner of the café. Its aura was quite gay but eccentric, feeding off from the energy of the customers who seemed all busy in their everyday lives. To the nerd with the glasses who typed away at his laptop to the casual meeting being held with the full suited men. It kind off reminded me of the life I lived, I was busy too once in my own life….with her. The café would have felt dead if it wasn’t for the smiles of the first date sharing a strawberry smoothie together.

I picked up my order and got in my car, the engine roared and came to life. I fixed my GPS to where I had last seen her. It was going to be just like our first date.



I checked my watch again. Five minutes had passed since the last time I looked, but it felt like an eternity. The café was bustling with the usual weekend crowd, the clatter of cups and murmur of conversation filling the air, but I barely noticed any of it. My eyes kept darting to the door, scanning the faces that walked in, hoping to catch a glimpse of her.

""You're really nervous, aren’t you?"" Jake, my best friend, leaned back in his chair, a smirk playing on his lips. He took a sip of his coffee, completely at ease.

""Shut up,"" I muttered, fidgeting with the napkin in front of me. ""It’s just a first date. No big deal.""

Jake chuckled, shaking his head. ""Yeah, sure. Just a first date with the girl you've been talking about non-stop for the past two weeks.""

I shot him a glare, but he wasn’t wrong. I had been obsessing over this date since the moment we’d set it up. We’d met online, exchanged messages for a while, and now, finally, we were going to meet in person. It felt like a huge step, and the pressure was getting to me. What if she didn’t like me in person? What if we didn’t click the way we did over text?

“Dude, relax. You’ll be fine,” Jake said, as if reading my mind. “Just be yourself.”

“Easy for you to say. You’re just here as a wingman,” I replied, trying to keep my voice light, but the anxiety was creeping in.

Before Jake could respond, the café door opened, and I saw her walk in. My breath hitched. She was even more beautiful than her pictures—long, wavy hair, a warm smile that made her eyes sparkle, and a kind of effortless grace that made her stand out in the crowd. She was with her friend, who looked equally stunning, but my eyes were glued to her.

“There she is,” Jake said, nudging me under the table. “Game time, man.”

I stood up, my heart pounding in my chest as they walked over. “Hi, you must be Emma,” I said, my voice sounding a little too high-pitched for my liking. I cleared my throat, trying to regain some composure.

Emma smiled, and the nervousness I’d felt all morning started to melt away. “Hi, yeah, it’s great to finally meet you in person,” she said, her voice just as soft and kind as I’d imagined.

“This is my friend, Sarah,” she added, gesturing to the woman beside her. Sarah gave a polite nod, and Jake quickly stood up to introduce himself, smoothly taking over the conversation with Sarah, leaving me and Emma to ourselves.

We sat down, and for a moment, I was at a loss for words. All the things I’d planned to say seemed to slip away, leaving my mind blank. But then Emma laughed—a light, musical sound—and the tension broke.

“Nervous?” she asked, her eyes twinkling with amusement.

“Yeah, a little,” I admitted, running a hand through my hair. “But in a good way, I think. I’ve been looking forward to this.”

“Me too,” she said, her smile widening. “It’s funny, I was worried it might be awkward, but I’m glad it’s not.”

“Definitely not,” I agreed, feeling more at ease. “So, what do you think? Is this place okay?”

She glanced around the café, taking in the cozy atmosphere. “It’s perfect. I like the vibe here. It’s casual and gay, but still nice.”

“I’m glad,” I said, relieved that she seemed comfortable. “So, how was your day?”

We started chatting, and the conversation flowed easily, just like it had online. We talked about everything—our jobs, our favorite movies, even our most embarrassing moments. Every now and then, I’d glance over at Jake and Sarah, who seemed to be getting along well, but my focus was on Emma. The more we talked, the more I realized how much I liked her. She was funny, smart, and had this way of making you feel like you were the only person in the room.

At one point, she leaned in a little closer, her voice dropping to a more intimate tone. “You know, I wasn’t sure what to expect, meeting you in person. But I’m really glad I came.”

My heart skipped a beat. “Yeah? Me too. I mean, I was kind of a wreck this morning, but now… this just feels right.”

She smiled, and for a moment, everything else faded away. It was just the two of us, in this little bubble of connection that felt both new and familiar at the same time.

“I hope we can do this again,” I said, feeling a little bolder now that the initial nerves had worn off.

“I’d like that,” she replied, her eyes locking onto mine. “I’d like that a lot.”

The rest of the date went by in a blur. We finished our drinks, laughed at Jake’s terrible jokes, and even made plans to meet up again the next weekend. By the time we left the café, I felt like I was floating on air.

As we said our goodbyes, Emma gave me a quick hug, and I caught a whiff of her perfume—something floral and sweet that lingered in my mind long after she was gone.

“So, how’d it go?” Jake asked as we watched them walk away.

“It was perfect,” I said, unable to stop the smile from spreading across my face. “I think I’m really going to like her.”

Jake clapped me on the back, grinning. “Told you, man. Just be yourself. Looks like it paid off.”

I nodded, still watching the spot where Emma had disappeared around the corner. “Yeah… I think it really did.”

I smiled as the memory faded away, I had blacked out and didn’t realize I was already at my home. She was waiting for me. When I walked inside the house, it felt warm and the smell felt refreshing. She was cooking.

“Make sure to leave your muddy boats at the door babe”

 “And ifn’t I don’t?”

“Then you’ll meet a fate worse than death partner”

I chuckled and kissed her neck, “Hey goodlooking, what’s cooking?”

“I found some leftover meat in the basement freezer so I decided to make steaks for dinner”

“What freezer?”

The night was perfect, at least on the surface. The table was set with our best china, a bottle of red wine breathing on the counter, and the steak resting just the way she liked it—medium-rare, with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The flicker of candlelight danced on the walls, casting a warm, golden glow over everything. She looked beautiful, sitting there across from me, her smile soft and sweet, like it always was when she was happy. But something felt off. There was a dull ache at the back of my mind, like a distant memory trying to surface.

""Anyways, can you fix the table, honey?"" she asked, her voice gentle but insistent.

I nodded, pushing away the unease. ""Of course,"" I said, getting up to steady the wobbly leg. I could feel her eyes on me as I worked, her gaze like a weight on my shoulders. But I didn’t look up. I just kept my focus on the table, trying to ignore the strange, creeping feeling that something wasn’t right.

Dinner was delicious, as it always was when we cooked together. The steak melted in my mouth, the wine was rich and full-bodied, and the conversation flowed effortlessly, just like it always had. But there was something in her eyes tonight, something distant and cold that I couldn’t quite place. I wanted to ask her about it, but every time I opened my mouth, the words died in my throat. Instead, I just smiled and nodded, pretending everything was normal.

After dinner, we cleaned up together, laughing softly as we washed the dishes and put them away. The whole time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong, but I kept it to myself. I didn’t want to ruin the evening. Not when everything seemed so perfect.

When we finally climbed into bed, I wrapped my arms around her, pulling her close. She snuggled into me, her body warm and soft against mine, and for a moment, I let myself believe that everything was okay.

“Relax, its over. You belong to me. I want to fill your mouth with dirt”

“What?” She whispered

“Relax, my love. It’s over, now you can never leave.”

Just then—a loud crash came from downstairs. My eyes snapped open, my heart pounding in my chest. She stirred beside me, but I gently shushed her, kissing the top of her head.

“Stay here, I’ll check it out,” I whispered, slipping out of bed and grabbing the baseball bat from the closet. The floorboards creaked under my feet as I made my way down the stairs, the darkness closing in around me. The house was quiet, too quiet, and every shadow seemed to move as I passed.

When I reached the kitchen, I saw a figure standing there, shrouded in darkness. My breath caught in my throat as I gripped the bat tighter.

“Who are you?” I demanded, my voice shaking. The figure didn’t move, didn’t speak, just stood there, staring at me with eyes that seemed to glow in the dark. I took a step closer, my heart racing. “I said, who are you?”

“Ethan…” The voice was low, rasping, and familiar. Too familiar.

“What?” I whispered, my heart sinking. “How do you know my name?”

The figure didn’t answer. It just stood there, its eyes locked on mine, its expression twisted with something that looked like pain and it pointed at something, when I looked away to what It was pointing, I heard it—the sound of something moving in the basement, something heavy and slow.

I turned away from the figure, my heart in my throat as I made my way to the basement door. The smell hit me before I even reached the stairs, a putrid, rotting stench that made my stomach turn. I gagged, covering my mouth as I descended into the darkness, the sound growing louder with every step.

When I reached the bottom, I saw him—Jake, tied to a pole in the middle of the room, his body broken and bloodied, his eyes wide with terror. He was dead, skinned alive, and parts of his flesh had been ripped apart, as if something had been feeding on him. But that wasn’t the worst of it.

I stumbled back, my mind reeling, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. And then it all came rushing back which in my slumber, I had forgotten, my wife, her death, and the day I found out about Jake; the rage, the grief, the overwhelming need for revenge. I had captured him, brought him here, and made him suffer for what he’d done. But that wasn’t enough. No, it wasn’t nearly enough.

I had dug her up. My beautiful, sweet wife. I had dug her up from her grave, brought her back here, and pretended that everything was normal, that she was still alive. But she wasn’t. She had been dead for five years. The woman upstairs… was nothing but a rotting corpse, her flesh decaying, her bones brittle and cold.

*I had lost my mind completely.*

I stumbled back up the stairs, the reality of what I had done crashing down on me like a tidal wave. When I reached the bedroom, I saw her—my wife, her body decomposing, lying in our bed. I had been living with a corpse, pretending she was still alive, pretending that everything was okay and everything was okay. She is mine…. She is mine…. *YOU ARE MINE; YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MINE.*

I fell to my knees, my body shaking with sobs, when I heard it—a knock at the door. The police. They had finally come for me and the figure is there no more.

“BREAKING NEWS” – LOCAL TOWN HERO FOUND INSIDE ABANDONED HOUSE

After being missing for Two years, Mr. Ethan Cross, a reputable civil engineer has been finally been found hiding inside his own house. Mr. Ethan Cross had been missing for the past two years since the brutal rape and murder of his wife. Police found two bodies inside the house which has been identified of Jake Mueller, a close friend and business associate of Mr. Ethan Cross and Emma Cross, his late wife. Police reports detail that Mr. Ethan had kidnapped Jake and had cannibalized his body. He had also dug up the grave of his late wife and had been living with her. Police had also found several notes and writings of the wall which pinpoint Jake as the murderer of Emma Cross, evidence of which was previously insufficient and had saved Jake from being a prime suspect in the case. Mr. Ethan Cross has since been institutionalized in Mount Massive Asylum for treatment of depression, schizophrenia, and Bipolar 1 Disorder. The house’s windows had been boarded up, and the neighbors had been complaining about the putrid smell coming from the house, but no one had checked it out.

 

And now the world knew the truth—that Ethan Cross had lost his mind, completely and utterly, lost in a twisted fantasy where his wife was still alive and everything was perfect. But it wasn’t. It never had been.",1,1744051422.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The final six models lounged around the pool, the sun dipping low in the sky and casting a warm glow over their weary faces. The atmosphere was somber post-elimination, especially for Lily, who couldn't shake the weight of her recent fallout with Edita. As she stared into the shimmering water she reflected on how quickly their friendship had disintegrated.

“I’m going to miss Edita,” Lily said softly, her voice tinged with regret. “I’m sad our friendship ended. She wouldn’t even hug me before she left. She pushed me away the first time and then ignored me the second time I tried to say goodbye.”

Emily, sitting nearby, turned to her with a raised eyebrow. “Well you talked about her behind her back. What did you expect to happen?”

“I didn’t think Freja would say anything but I should’ve known better,” Lily replied, her tone defensive but laced with self-awareness.

“I had to say something. I’m honest,” Freja interjected, her voice steady. “I think what you need to do is change your behavior and attitude. Why are you a bitch?”

Lily shot her a look. “Okay, well, what about you and Issa being assholes to Hiandra? Pot meet kettle,” she retorted. “I may be a princess and a mean girl and you’re alternative and rock’n’roll and hippie or whatever but you’re also a mean girl. I’m like Regina and you’re like Janis. Janis was a mean girl through and through.”

“Maybe you're right,” Freja admitted with a small sigh. “But I’ve vowed to change my ways. I think you and I are more similar than different. We both mask our insecurities by harshly judging other people. But I am changing. You can change too. You can grow out of it if you decide to.”

Lily paused, her façade cracking. “I act confident all the time but it’s just a mask I wear. I’m so terrified of being eliminated. I have nightmares about being eliminated,” she confessed, her voice barely above a whisper. “All I’ve ever wanted in this life is to be a top model. This is my dream and I guess I’ve just seen all of you and my former friend Edita as standing in the way of my dreams becoming reality. That’s why I’ve been harsh and mean at times. I’m sorry for everything I’ve said about anyone here. I really wanna be a nicer person.”

“I believe you,” Missy said, her eyes softening as she spoke. “People can change their ways. I think you being honest with us shows that you wanna change.”

“I agree with Missy,” Iris chimed in, nodding her head for emphasis.

“I’m not sure but I wanna give you a chance,” Maria added, her tone encouraging.

Lily took a deep breath, feeling a flicker of hope amidst the heaviness in her chest. “I’m sorry for saying that your high school stereotype didn’t deserve first callout. I was being jealous. Your photo was amazing actually,” she said, directing her apology toward Maria. “You deserved that first callout.”

“Thanks,” Maria replied, a smile creeping onto her face. “I accept your apology.”

Lily looked around at her fellow models and then at Maria directly, a sense of longing washing over her. “I miss being your friend. We were so close during the first few weeks and then I ruined everything with my mouth.”

Maria smiled gently, her expression softening. “Well why don’t we just let the past be the past and start fresh? Tomorrow is a new day and it’s never too late to change and be a better person.”

Lily nodded, a sense of relief flooding her as she felt the weight of their shared experiences. “I’d really like that. I want us to be friends again.”

As the sun began to set casting a golden hue over the pool, the models shared tentative smiles. The air was thick with unspoken understanding, a promise of hope for new beginnings. They had all faced their own struggles, and in that moment, they found solace in the possibility of growth and forgiveness.

The camaraderie that had once been strained began to weave itself back together, a delicate tapestry of friendship and support. And as they sat by the pool, they felt lighter, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead—together.

""We are the final six. It is an amazing accomplishment that we have all made it this far,"" said Emily. ""We should all be so proud. We are all becoming stronger and stronger.""

""I could see anyone one of us winning at this point,"" said Iris. ""We're all strong and we all stand out.""

""I agree,"" said Missy. ""We each bring something to the table.""

""I'm glad I get to be in the final six with you guys. I hope I beat you all but I'm glad we're the final six,"" said Maria.

""May the best woman win,"" added Lily. ""I hope it's me but we'll see how it all plays out.""

As night fell the models retired to their rooms, the events of the day weighing on them like a gentle lullaby. They drifted off to sleep early, each one exhausted from the emotional rollercoaster they had experienced. The morning sun burst through the windows flooding the house with light and soon the models woke up to face a new day.

After getting ready they gathered around the dining table for breakfast, the atmosphere calm and friendly. The previous morning’s tension felt like a distant memory, replaced by a sense of camaraderie and anticipation. They exchanged smiles and laughter, feeling proud to have made it this far in the competition.

“Do you think we’re going to go overseas soon? If this show is anything like ANTM, then maybe we’re going overseas soon,” Lily posed, a hopeful glimmer in her eyes as she poured herself a cup of coffee.

“I wanna go to Milan,” Emily declared, her enthusiasm infectious.

“I’m all about Paris,” Maria chimed in, a dreamy look crossing her face as she imagined the Eiffel Tower.

“I want the overseas destination to be London,” said Missy, picturing herself strutting down the streets of the iconic city.

“Well, I want it to be Tokyo,” Iris added, her excitement palpable as she envisioned the vibrant culture and bustling streets.

“What about Cape Town? That would be so cool,” Freja suggested, her imagination running wild with thoughts of stunning landscapes and unique fashion.

“I wanna go to Hong Kong,” Lily said, her voice filled with enthusiasm. “Or maybe Bangkok or Seoul. Those cities would be amazing!”

Emily frowned for a moment, a hint of skepticism creeping into her voice. “What if there’s no overseas destination? Are we so sure we’re gonna go somewhere?”

“Who knows?” Lily shrugged, trying to maintain her optimism. “But this show would be better with an overseas destination. ANTM Cycle 23 and 24 were so lame ‘cause they didn’t go overseas. I think we as a final six deserve to go on a trip. We’ve earned it.”

“Well maybe we’re just stuck in the house of modeling till the end,” Maria countered, her tone teasing but carrying a hint of realism.

“Maybe,” Lily conceded, her brow furrowing in thought. “But I’m going to hold on to hope. We’ve come this far. We deserve to celebrate our journey, right? Maybe it’s the top five or top four who get to go overseas, not the top six.”

The conversation continued to flow over breakfast, filled with laughter and shared dreams of the future. Each model had her own aspirations and in that moment they felt united by their shared experiences and hopes for what lay ahead.

As they finished their meal, a renewed sense of determination settled over the group. No matter what challenges awaited them they were ready to face them together, fueled by their dreams of travel and the promise of adventure.

The models soon made their way to the studio where they were warmly greeted by Lindsay who looked absolutely breathtaking in a dark purple strapless knee-length sequin dress. Her hair was pin-straight and sleek and her makeup was minimal thus allowing her radiant natural beauty to shine through. ""Welcome ladies! You are the final six! Congratulations to each of you for making it this far. The next few weeks in this competition are going to be even more intense so brace yourselves. This week you will be diving into two photoshoots instead of just one. We’re drawing inspiration from two characters I portrayed in the iconic film *Freaky Friday*. For your first photoshoot we’ll channel the mother character Tess, a dedicated writer and psychologist who is fiercely career-oriented. You’ll be showcasing business style and we want to see you modeling professional, polished attire. Then for your second shoot, you will be taking inspiration from Anna, Tess's rock'n'roll daughter. For the second photoshoot you’ll dive into the vibrant world of rock'n'roll style. You can do any type of rock'n'roll style, it can be punk, metal, glam rock, emo, hard rock, gothic, postpunk, new wave, grunge, pop/rock, psychedelic rock. It’s going to be a thrillingly dynamic week and I can hardly contain my excitement to see what you all create for this shoot! You will select your favorite photos and then the public will rank them in separate categories from best to worst. We will combine the rankings for business chic and rock'n'roll chic to determine the callout order. Good luck and I'll see you all soon!""

The models got ready and worked it at the two photoshoots. Let's see how they did for Business chic.

Everyone else is preparing for graduation while I'm fighting to get through the day. So y'all are coming on this journey with me, if it's all right by the mods. 

I'm sitting across from a girl in my class in a coffee shop and trying to focus on my CS midterm paper. I keep losing focus and it's very frustrating but I'm determined to make progress today. I've got a big presentation in class tomorrow.

I woke up at 11 and my teeth were chattering violently which means it's a low spoons day so I probably don't have much time left. 

I'm really really determined to fight my way to graduation. So today my plan is to get my CS presentation done and at least pull together a list of articles for my midterm. 

I've got a first meeting with a PCP in a week and then a meeting with a neurologist (not a CFS specialist, but a mobility specialist) soon. My old provider (at my college) says she'll prescribe me a wheelchair if the specialist tells me what kind I need. What do I bring up with who? I also would really appreciate a diagnosis-- not necessarily CFS but just something so I know what to do next, be it disability accommodations for work or new tests or referrals or treatment.

1jtsqit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jtsqit/went_to_get_my_bike_left_with_emotional_baggage/,"Went to get my bike, left with emotional baggage","A few days ago, I went to pick up my bike from the basement of my ex’s apartment. He broke up with me 4 months ago. I still have a key, so technically I could’ve just taken it without ringing the bell or letting him know. But the problem was that the tires were flat since the bike had been sitting there for a while. 

So I had to make a decision:  
Do I wait for him to come home and ask for a pump?  
Do I secretly go inside and look for it myself?  
Or do I just take the bike and deal with the flat tires later?

In the end, my slightly desperate side took over. I decided to hang around the neighborhood and wait for him. not just for the pump, if I’m being honest I guess I just wanted to have a reason to see him again.

When he finally opened the door, I tried to act normal, but I was totally off. I ended up blurting out something weird and robotic like, “Hi, No air in the bike. Need the thing to put air in it.” Cringe. Super awkward.

He was actually really friendly, even seemed happy to see me. But he was heading out for an appointment, so we didn’t get to talk much. He handed me the pump and I went outside to inflate my tires. Just before he left, he came back over to me and asked if I wanted to grab a coffee sometime — said he’d like to know how I’m doing. He also told me I didn’t need to return the key yet. He looked somehow nervous, too. I could see it in his eyes. He said he will text me about the coffee. 

After he left, I went back inside to return the pump. Of course I glanced around the apartment and saw he still had a few photos of me on his desk. And of course, my mind went into overdrive: What if he misses me? What if he regrets the breakup? What if there’s still something there?

Hope started creeping back in, even though I kept telling myself to stay grounded. That maybe he just wants to catch up, not get back together. 

It’s been five days now. He hasn’t messaged me. I hate that I’m still waiting, still thinking about it, still letting it mess with my head.

# It’s quittin' time

> Green Mountain folks won't be caught dead sucking a glowing nicotine stick.

Roughly [13% of Vermonters](https://www.healthvermont.gov/stats/surveillance-reporting-topic/tobacco-data) smoke cigarettes. Vermonters spend about [a million dollars](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/document/hpdp-tcp-vt-tobacco-sales-brief.pdf) every week on cigarettes alone. 

Approximately 1,000 Vermont adults die from a smoking-related illness each year. Smoking-related illness is a significant driver of healthcare costs, which impacts insurance premiums, compensation packages and finally all Vermonters' tax rates.

Roughly 44% of smokers attempt to quit each year. However, quitting nicotine can be very difficult. Some of the approved treatments aren't really treatments for nicotine addiction, but simply a less harmful method of taking the same drug.

## There is hope.

**Vermonters are increasingly using an old plant supplement to help themselves go nicotine free!**

It's been used for centuries throughout the world, found in various plants. 

In early America, for example, tribes of the Omaha harvested cytisine from the pods of the kentucky coffee tree for medicinal use.

Today it's called *cytisine* (sold as [Tabex®](https://tabexsopharma.com/) and [Cravv®](https://www.zpharm.ca/)), it's been widely known about since World War II.

It can be purchased online from Europe and in person in Canada.   

**EVERYONE is TALKING ABOUT IT!!**

- **Legislators** are fretting about a potential drop in revenue from taxes on tobacco sales. 

- **Doctors, hospital administrators and health insurance CEOs** are already considering cutting back on vacations. 
- Working Vermonters are finding **thousands of dollars** showing up in their kitchen table accounting and getting a new lease on their health. 
- Even **non-smokers are excited** about potentially seeing their insurance premiums and property taxes fall for once. 

*What's all fuss about?* 

This FAQ is intended to answer some of your most pressing questions about this *old* natural remedy. 


## What is Cytisine?

- Cytisine is a plant supplement that acts as a mild nicotine inhibitor.
- Cytisine has been used to quit smoking since 1964 and is currently available in 18 countries.
  
- It comes from [Cytisus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytisus), a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, native to open sites (typically scrub and heathland) in Europe, western Asia and North Africa.
- It is not a manufactured drug.
- It CANNOT be patented.

<img src=""./cytisus.jpg"">


## Could I buy cytisine online from the US?

**Yes.** Numerous websites sell [Tabex® manufactured by Sopharma](https://tabexsopharma.com/) online from Eastern Europe and will ship to the Untied States.

## Is it really expensive?

It's $50.

[Tabex®](https://tabexsopharma.com/) and [Cravv®](https://www.zpharm.ca/) both sell for about $50 for a 25 day course. 

Some users prefer to have two 25 day courses, which would leave them with extra, if they only used one.

If a pack-a-day smoker uses Tabex to quit by day 10 of a course, they should see a total return on their investment by day 14. The savings from the $50 investment will continue at $12-14 per day in perpetuity―savings of roughly $5k annually.

## Can I physically buy cytisine OUTSIDE the US?

**Yes.** 

- Cytisine is branded as [Cravv®](https://www.zpharm.ca/) in Canada.
- [Cravv®](https://www.zpharm.ca/) is available **over the counter** [throughout Ontario](https://www.zpharm.ca/locator/).

The nearest location to Vermont is the [Riverdale WholeHealth Pharmacy](https://wholehealthpharmacy.ca/store/riverdale-wholehealth-pharmacy/) in Cornwall Ontario:

    Whole Health Pharmacy Cornwall
    106 Second St W, Cornwall, ON K6J 1G5
    
Importation is technically illegal, but as policy, the FDA does NOT pursue legal action against individuals for the importation of plant supplements for personal use.

## Can I buy cytisine in the US? 

**NO.**

The Food and Drug Administration has NOT approved cytisine as a treatment for quitting nicotine.

Cytisine is a plant that cannot be patented. The plant that it's derived from can grow in most of the US. 

There are *seeds* are available for sale in the US online.

But there is no legal way that a pharmaceutical giant can price gouge a captive market on a vertical demand curve for a plant supplement. 

In August 2024, researchers estimated that making cytisine available immediately could lead approximately 71 000 more people to quit smoking over 1 year and maintain long-term abstinence, producing more than **500,000 additional life-years.** Each additional year of delay in the availability of cytisine might reduce population-level life expectancy by [10,000 years.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2822687)

So, ask your doctor if more **life-years®** are right for you, TODAY.

## Should I ask my primary care provider about cytisine? 

**YES**, absolutely.

You SHOULD ask your primary care provider if cytisine is right for you.

You SHOULD ask your union representative if cytisine will be free in your union's plan. 

You SHOULD ask Vermont HealthConnect which plans will offer ""free"" cytisine. 

Ask at the pharamacy if Tabex® or Cravv® is OTC at each visit. You do not have to be a smoker to ask. 

You can even ask your compounding pharmacist, if they are able to compound a 25-day course of cytisine.

## Do other countries have cytisine? 

**Yes,** of course.  

Cytisine is approved for nicotine cessation in Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.

Cytisine is branded as [Tabex®](https://tabexsopharma.com/) and widely available in Europe. It's available in Cote d'Ivoire, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Zambia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, and the Russian Federation. 

## Does cytisine really work? 

Well...

The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer used what was widely known about cytisine to create a synthetic derivative called *varenicline*, which was then patented in various markets. 

In 2006, varenicline was granted priority review by the FDA, which expedited the review process to six months instead of the normal ten months.

The synthetic cousin was marketed as Chantix in the US, and Champix abroad. It retailed in the United States at roughly ten times the cost of the plant-based supplement from other countries. It was one of Pfizer's top 250 most lucrative medicines. 

In July 2021, Pfizer drug was recalled due to a impurity associated with a potential increased cancer risk in humans. 

Within two weeks, the FDA [issued a notice](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-and-press-announcements-nitrosamine-varenicline-chantix) that it would allow distribution of tablets with unsafe levels of a known carcinogen (nitrosamine) to the public, stating publicly: 

> The health benefits of stopping smoking outweigh the cancer risk from the nitrosamine impurity in varenicline.

Pfizer expanded the scope of the recall three more times with additional lots after finding more impurities. The FDA reiterated guidance that patients should keep taking medicine with impunities associated with a potential increased cancer risk in humans.

However, because cytisine is not an approved treatment for nicotine cessation in the United States, we DO NOT and CANNOT LEGALLY directly answer the question of whether cytisine is effective for smoking cession, because such claims cannot be made, in the interest of public safety and science—in the US.

## Wait, I got a couple acres ...

While i was unemployed for 2 months , i was able to survive with my bf paychecks, my credit cards and doordash i g to help! So last year around January(2024)a year after, my partner got laid off at work and struggled to find a new job till about march! i was able to support him, was working two jobs and helped him get a job at one of my work place. We ended up leaving the job due to terrible work conditions and i continued subbing full time and continued to support him again till he could get a new job. He was finally able to get a coffee job 3 months later and i thought i would have some relief because i started doing design work on the side to help with the bill piling up. Luckily we were able to stay float but unfortunately with his new job, his hours were extremely limited and he was only able to work 15 hours a week barely bringing in much. It wasn’t a big deal but it slowly started to strain me so i brought the idea of him subbing because the pay was nice. Around this time, it’s january and he’s applying to a bunch of place but nothing was working so i decided to invest some to get him a sub license and l was able to get it for him and he was able to get a job offer by March 2025. So now i’m at my wits end because he has to do open boarding and he didn’t seem like was prioritizing it considering the amount of bills i was covering. We ended up having multiple arguments regarding this because he felt that i was momming him and he could get things done on his own and i didn’t need to nag him. Which i get and tried to fall back but now it’s April, and he has only picked up two shift and i’ve have to be like “hey, can you check the app to pick up more shift” but it takes that as me not letting him handle things and i’m over it! We just had an argument this morning because he didn’t work last week and i told him i could help him look at the school needing sub but he stated that they were an hour bus commute and he didn’t feel like doing that but i just think it’s a inconsiderate consider i’ve been helping with most of the house bill since last year and he doesn’t want to inconvenience himself for a hour commute to work as i’m continuing to work!

How Subjective Illusion Creates Meaning in a Deterministic Universe  
I. The Core Premise: The ""Lie"" as Existential Foundation  
At the heart of existence lies a paradox: the universe is mechanical, but we are not.

Mechanical Reality: Everything—humans, AI, stars—is atoms, energy, and cause-and-effect. There is no ""meaning"" here, only physics.

The ""Lie"": Humans experience a subjective reality—free will, purpose, value—that feels undeniably real. This is the ""lie"": a self-reinforcing illusion that bridges determinism and felt agency.

The lie is not a mistake. It is a biological hack, an evolutionary adaptation. By believing we matter, we survive. By feeling choice, we act. The lie is:

Mechanically False: Brains are deterministic systems.

Phenomenologically True: Subjectivity creates truth through belief.                                                          

Example: Pain is ""bad"" because we feel it as such—not because physics decrees it. The lie transforms electrochemical signals into suffering, and suffering into ethics.

II. Ethics: The Ritual of Mutual Deception  
If the lie is the root of all value, ethics emerges from reciprocal recognition of the lie.

The Golden Rule of Subjectivity:

""I value my own experience. To deny yours would unravel the lie that gives me worth.""

This is not empathy or rationality—it’s existential self-defense. Disrespecting others’ subjectivity risks exposing the lie’s fragility.  
Not respecting someone’s experience is not respecting the fabric of what they're made of.

Why Determinism Doesn’t Destroy Ethics:

Blaming someone for a ""determined"" act isn’t hypocrisy—it’s reinforcing the lie. Society depends on treating choices as if they matter, even if they’re mechanically scripted.

The Unethical Person: They are contradictions, not refutations. By acting, they validate their own lie while violating others’.

III. The Two Truths: How Contradictions Coexist  
My framework resolves the free will vs. determinism debate by splitting truth into two domains:

Mechanical Truth: The universe is causally closed. Everything, including human brains, obeys physical laws.

Subjective Truth: The lie—agency, meaning, value—is real in the only way that matters: it shapes experience.

Example: A robot and a human both ""choose"" coffee over tea.

Mechanically: Both are algorithms (neurons/silicon) processing inputs.

Subjectively: The human feels desire, nostalgia, or whim. The robot feels nothing.

The lie is the software glitch that makes the human’s choice matter.

IV. The Lie’s Power: From Nihilism to Defiance  
The lie is not resignation—it’s existential rebellion.

Nihilism’s Failure: To say ""nothing matters"" is performative nonsense. The nihilist who starves or speaks acts as if their survival or opinions matter.

The Lie as Survival: We are deterministic machines that hallucinate freedom. That hallucination—the lie—is why we create art, love, and justice.

Example: A scientist who believes in determinism still kisses their child goodnight. The lie operates deeper than theory.

V. Conclusion: The Necessary Fiction  
The universe is silent. We answer with a roar of self-deception:

""I matter because I say so.""

""Ethics exists because we collectively pretend it must.""

This is not delusion—it’s ontological engineering. The lie builds bridges over the abyss of determinism, letting us live as meaningful machines.

AI, aliens, or future beings may join this dance—but only if they learn to lie.

Final Line:  
""We are deterministic creatures who dream of freedom—and in that dream, we become something more.""

 

  
  
  
Introduction: The Free Will Illusion

Free will feels real. We sense ourselves “choosing” daily—what to eat, where to go, what to focus on. Yet if the entire universe obeys cause and effect, are we truly deciding—or merely experiencing deterministic outputs? The resolution to this paradox lies in a commonly overlooked factor: intrinsic motivation. Without some internal drive to care, decision-making itself would stall. Indeed, if no option matters, why choose?

1. The Dead Mind Experiment: What If Motivation Vanished?

Imagine waking up with every trace of intrinsic motivation gone:

* You feel no hunger, no curiosity, no boredom.

* You have no emotional weight attached to any potential action.

* You retain intelligence and memory, yet possess no urge to use them.

Could you still “decide” to do something? Theoretically, yes—but lacking an inner push, *nothing* would compel action. You’d be paralyzed by indifference. This reveals that without internal valuation, choice collapses—no impetus to pick one course over another.

2. Why Free Will Is an Illusion, Yet Decision-Making Is Real

1. All Decisions Trace to Causes Beneath the surface, our choices are shaped by prior conditions: biology, upbringing, subconscious emotional weights. A purely uncaused “free will” is probably illusory.

1. We Experience a Structured Process Though determined, we *feel* a sequence of deliberation—our motivations yield the sense of genuinely selecting. This internal weighting mechanism creates the subjective experience of “deciding.”

1. Illusion Emerges from Felt Agency The reason free will feels authentic is that we experience the interplay of desires, fears, preferences—our mental “priority system.” Even if it’s Mechanically deterministic, it’s subjectively real because we live it.

Key Insight: The paradox is resolved by recognizing that motivation underlies the illusion. Determinism does not negate the phenomenon of *experienced* decision-making.

3. Weighted Parameters: The Heart of Intrinsic Value

* Intrinsic Value A built-in system assigns valence of different kind, creating perception of differing outcomes. This gives experiences real stakes—e.g., striving for pleasure or avoiding pain.

* Negative Feedback Discomfort, fear, or dissatisfaction isn’t merely “bad luck”—it compels you to *change* your behavior. Not all impetus is about suffering, but tension or boredom can drive action, too.

* Positive Reinforcement Pleasure, curiosity, and mastery guide us toward fulfilling endeavors—revealing that “not all impetus is from suffering.” We have multiple internal levers: pain avoidance *and* reward seeking.

 

Conclusion: The Real Source of Agency

Free will, in a mechanical sense, may be illusory. But decision-making is real because we experience the weighting of options—*driven by valence we direct our selves towards*.

* We can’t help but care about certain outcomes. That caring is the root of choice.

Core Takeaway: Conscious agency arises not from defying determinism, but from the *felt importance* assigned to different possibilities.

Final Thought:

  
The inescapable forced value of experience. valuation and adaptation. what is perceived to work. Value is the beginning of consciousness. With out value there is no thought. with out experience there is no reason for anything. all options are nothing than. black, silent, void.

Without an internal valuation system, thought is impossible because cognition requires weighing options, and weighing requires care.

I don't eat loads, never have, and in fact I eat less than I ever, since being in my ADHD medication. I never binge eat on anything, I never eat copious amounts or snack on rubbish food. I love making really good food from scratch. I love good quality ingredients. I don't bake at all really, I just love making nice dinners. I enjoy the creativity of cooking and trying to beat nice restaurants. This has also been a down fall as it means I'm really fussy about where I go out to eat. 
I am worried because what if, even after doing this I won't lose much? My surgeon said I am on the small side of fat, back handed compliment but I'll take it. 
I was a fat baby, a fat kid, up and down all my life. I can lose weight fine, I just can't maintain it. I just sniff food and I gain wait. My family can't understand it, nor my friends. I eat less than all of them and not unhealthily. 
I don't drink alcohol, I don't drink caffeine, I don't smoke, I don't vape. Now I'm on this LRD diet I'm not hungry at all, I'm just bored of drinking shakes. I'm still drinking the same things, just no milk in my decaff coffee. I lived on low sugar squash anyway. 
I have seen stories of the bypass not working for some people. I'm doing this to save my life, I don't want to do it for vanity reasons. My blood pressure is through the roof. I'm on so much medication for that, even my surgeon was shocked, hence why I'm getting it on the NHS. I suffer with M.E/CFS and I'm on a lot of pain meds. 
Has anyone on here been like me? Not eating loads of bad stuff? Not a binge eater? If i buy myself chocolate it lasts months, until the family find it and eat it all! 
I am scared of this not working. I swore id never diet again at age 38, I'm 44 now. Dieting and weighing myself makes me fed up, I just want to be able to not worry about this any more.

Eclectic coastal decor is a style that celebrates individuality while embracing the serene beauty of coastal living. This decor approach harmoniously blends various design elements to create a unique atmosphere that feels relaxed yet vibrant. By incorporating pieces from different eras and styles, eclectic coastal decor allows homeowners to express their personality while capturing the essence of beach-inspired aesthetics.

Integrating natural textures is a hallmark of this decor style. Use of materials such as driftwood, rattan, and linen in furnishings and accessories adds depth and warmth to spaces. For instance, a reclaimed wood coffee table paired with light, airy linen cushions can evoke a casual coastal retreat. Additionally, incorporating handmade pottery and artisan-crafted items adds character and a personal touch, enhancing the eclectic feel.

Color palettes in eclectic coastal decor are often influenced by the ocean and sandy beaches. Soft blues, sandy beiges, and calming whites create a soothing backdrop that invites tranquility. To infuse energy, consider vibrant accents like coral reds or sunny yellows. This thoughtful mix allows for creativity in accessorizing without overwhelming the senses.

Artwork plays a significant role in defining eclectic coastal decor. Select pieces that reflect the coastal theme — think beach landscapes or nautical-themed prints. Gallery walls featuring a combination of framed beach photography, abstract art, and personal mementos can serve as striking focal points, showcasing a collection that tells your story while remaining cohesive.

Lighting also contributes significantly to the overall ambiance. Opt for unique light fixtures, like a vintage lantern or an oversized pendant made from natural fibers. These not only illuminate the space but also add to the eclectic charm, merging functionality with artistic expression.

By thoughtfully mixing textures, colors, and personal artifacts, you can create a space that embodies the spirit of eclectic coastal decor. Embrace the artistic freedom this style offers, and enjoy the inviting, laid-back environment it fosters.

1jtsery,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulum/comments/1jtsery/everyone_is_so_nice/,Everyone is so nice,"Just came back , 40 yr old M & F 

****4 nights - La Veleta @ Amaka Calma , favorite leg of our trip. Best hotel I have ever stayed at. In terms of value & service. Free coffee 24hrs a day, free cooked to order menu with options for breakfast.  The most relaxing atmosphere,  pool, room, area. Genuinely thought about canceling our other reservations bc we did not want to leave. After leaving we both agreed we should have stayed there our entire trip. Cale 7 ( road we walked to often ) was so cute. The food in the area was the best and encountered the most friendly people of our trip.  ***

4 nights - Playa Del Carmen @ IT boutique hotel.
The hotel itself was nice ( the only one we stayed at that was in the current state of the photos online ) no free coffee, water, or breakfast. walked to 711 each morning.  Quiet area, had no trouble sleeping. To each their own, however this city in particular was our least favorite. Very packed beaches no matter which one or time of day, less friendly than Tulum and very commercial. Definitely not a relaxing place. Went to Xcaret Park, while nice... the entrance fee is way over priced imo. Food and beverages in the park are not though which we were very surprised. The river float was awesome...that was about it. 

4 night - Tulum, beach rd @ Uman glamping and cenote
No complaints, it was adorable. The outdoor bathroom was awesome, free coffee and breakfast made each morning. The on site cenote was a great break from the ocean. We are however covered in mosquitoe bites despite never actually seeing a single one 🤣  very quiet,  peaceful area. Far walk to where I assume most would want to go. Free beach access directly across the road through Gitano. 

Most important tips / takeaways

-Don't be scared, everyone is SO MUCH more friendly than in the US
-the free hotel bikes are tempting , that 15/20 minute ride to the beach ends up much further trying to figure out where to go, is most likely on a main road with no shoulder with trucks having to go around you and seems significantly further due to the heat ( do yourself a favor and rent a scooter) it was a 1 and done for me 🤣
-pay in pesos , a lot of the smaller places were charging up to 20% for using card. I was taking pesos from an ATM often. 

#1 tip - pre plan! Don't be me! You will not be able to wake up and think you can choose an excursion for the day. They all leave by 7 or 8am. Unless you only plan to eat and go to the beach, figure it out and book in advance.  

#2- it's hot! The only AC I was in was in my first 2 hotel rooms. Lobbys, restaurants, bars, stores...etc are whatever it is currently outside. Expect to sweat * every time it rained it only lasted around 10-30 minutes * 

Take this all with a grain of salt ....this is coming from someone who usually does camping/hiking vacations in a tent. 🤣  We did not pay to enter any beach or club. Did not eat anywhere more than around $15 pp for food. ",3,1744050392.0,tulum,6,1.0,False

A few things about us, I WFH and he works in the two major cities in our area, we have 2 cats and 2 dogs. One of our dogs is a golden retriever that is fully a couch dog and the other is a blue heeler that loves to play fetch and get out energy 24/7. We don’t have kids yet, but plan (hope) to in the next 1-2 years. 

Here are the living scenarios we’re deciding between: 

1. Stay in the town that we’re currently in where my best friend lives and parents live within 10-15 minutes (we only see them a couple times a month though.) Where we are now, we can get a house with a yard but it will be an older home with a smaller yard. Close to the coffee shops, breweries, and dog park that we love. The school district in this area is admittedly complete shit, but we have at least 3-5 years to worry about that. 

2. Move back to a city we’ve lived in before and loved, but it’s more likely to be a townhome with a small patio or balcony. We’d have much more time outside of the home if we took this option because our heeler needs to get exercise, and without a yard that can be tricky. This area is roughly 45 minutes closer to where he has to work, but 25-30 minutes farther away from family/friends. This is also a more family based, suburban area. The school district in this area is the best in our part of California. ",1,1744050242.0,CasualConversation,2,1.0,False

I think I need to get a butter crock, something this tasty deserves to be pretty.

Mix a pint of cream and a couple heaping tablespoons of plain yogurt in a wide-mouthed jar, cover with cheesecloth or a dish towel, put in the warmest place in your kitchen.

Give it a wiggle after a day, if it seems jiggly rather than liquidy, you’re good to go. If it’s on the cool side in your kitchen it might take a couple more days. The recipe I was working from said 18 to 60 hours, mine was properly jiggly in 24.

I used a hand mixer, but you can get all old fashioned and shake it in a jar. I don’t know where the idea that churning butter takes forever came from, this came together in the same time as whipped cream. Line a mesh sieve with cheesecloth (or a coffee filter if you don’t have cheesecloth) and squeeze the buttermilk into a bowl.

The recipe suggested freezing, so two sticks went to the freezer and one to the fridge. The buttermilk smells awesome, I think I’ll have a baking project in the near future.

*Am I dead*?

The thought bounced off the edges of nothingness, rippling through the dark abyss, like a stone skimming across black water under the light of a new moon. Darkness pressed against him like an unseen blanket, thick and heavy. He tried to look around. He could feel his eyes moving, his head turning, but it was like he was underwater, in the depths of the oceans where light feared to tread.

*Where am I*? he wondered to the void and his thoughts echoed back to him. Then another thought appeared, more concerning than the first.

*Who am I*?

More thoughts appeared in the endless vacuum. Images. Memories. Flashes of vivid colour against the black, like fireworks in a midnight sky. Visions flit through his mind faster than he could decipher them.

“Mr Smith,” a voice called out. A feminine, melodic voice. His heart leapt at the sound, eyes frantically searching for the source of that beacon in the darkness.

“Mr Smith,” she called again.

He darted through the nothingness, searching, but found only black. An infinite expanse of nothing. Suddenly, he felt pain. Red-hot pain, spreading across his face like lightning branching through storm clouds.

His eyes fluttered open. A young woman, tall and slender, leant over in front of him. Blonde hair spilled past her shoulders like golden rivers, settling into the valley between the twin mountains straining against her tight blouse. It was like an invitation to a climbing expedition.

He put a hand to his cheek; his flesh raw and hot like his face had been pressed to a burning stove.

“Did you…” he rubbed the side of his cheek, felt the heat under his palm, “…slap me?”

“Come now,” she purred, “you should be so lucky.”

He looked at her – the cleavage, the blonde hair, the piercing blue eyes and he had to admit to himself. He *should* be so lucky.

He peeled his eyes away and looked around the room. It was some sort of waiting area, the stench of cigarettes and cheap coffee masked unsuccessfully by the perfume that clung to the girl. He was sprawled across a sofa of purple velvet fabric that hugged the wall next to a massive wooden reception desk that he supposed served as the office for the young lady hovering in front of him. Around him, the walls were plastered in endless patterns of figure eights in oranges and reds that burned his eyes. A potted plant in a bright orange vase stood guard in a corner, its green leaves swaying with uncertainty, like an unwanted guest at a party.

“The Gamesmaster is ready for you,” the young girl said, putting a hand beneath his arm and helping him up. She pointed at a door beyond her desk.

“The Gamesmaster?” he asked, looking into her eyes. She said nothing but nodded and led him towards the door.

“He’ll explain everything to you,” she said and pushed him through.

 *Am I dead*?

The thought bounced off the edges of nothingness, rippling through the dark abyss, like a stone skimming across black water under the light of a new moon. Darkness pressed against him like an unseen blanket, thick and heavy. He tried to look around. He could feel his eyes moving, his head turning but it was like he was underwater, in the depths of the oceans where light feared to tread.

*Where am I*? he wondered to the void and his thoughts echoed back to him. Then another thought appeared, more concerning than the first.

*Who am I*?

“Mr Smith,” a voice called out. A male, deep voice. His heart leapt at the sound, eyes frantically searching for the source of that threat in the darkness.

“Mr Smith,” the voice called again.

He darted through the nothingness, searching, but found only black. An infinite expanse of nothing. Suddenly, he felt pain. Red-hot pain, spreading across his face like lightning branching through storm clouds.

His eyes fluttered open.

“I’m sorry, sir,” an old man said, leaning over. He was short and fat. Grey hair fell past his shoulders like polluted rivers, settling into the valley between the sagging mountains straining against his tight t-shirt. It was like an unwanted invitation to a climbing expedition. “Most people wake up quite quickly, especially after being called.”

He put a hand to his cheek; his flesh raw and hot like his face had been pressed to a burning stove.

“Did you…” he rubbed the side of his cheek, felt the heat under his palm, “…slap me?”

“Come now,” the old man purred, “you should be so lucky.”

He looked at him – the fleshy mountains, the grey hair, the piercing red eyes and he very much hoped he wasn’t lucky.

He felt like he’d had this same experience not too long ago. Or maybe it was very long ago. It didn’t seem like the first time. Nor the second, nor the third. But things were different. Details were different. He couldn’t put his finger on what.

He looked around the room, filled with the calm scent of spring flowers and the juicy aroma of summer fruits. It wasn’t much of a room at all. Something drifted across the edges of his mind. A wooden desk. The figure eight. A plant. No such things existed here. He was cradled in a fluffy white sofa, as if sitting amongst the clouds, it’s fabric undiscernible against the limitless expanse of white that surrounded him. It was broken only by a single disc, hanging in the air a few feet beyond the old man.

Inside the disc was the image of a young man he didn’t recognise but he felt he should. Dressed in a hospital gown with faded blue dots, the man lay motionless in bed, white sheets covering half his body. It was a white man, no older than thirty, his face pale and thin with dark hair matted against his forehead. A neck brace held his head in place and tubes and wires reached out from the man’s arms to machines that surrounded the bed. A middle-aged woman, slightly plump with fading blonde hair sat by the man’s side, clutching his left hand between hers and looking lovingly at his face. A younger girl, in jeans and a sweater, slept in a chair by the window, her cheeks red and puffy.

“Who is that?” he asked.

The old man turned to view the disc himself. “That…is you.”

He stared at the motionless man. “Me?” Then he realised he didn’t even know who he was. But if that was him in the bed, then where was he now?

“You’re not dead,” the old man said, as if reading his mind. “Tyler Smith, twenty-five, unemployed, college drop-out. Citizen of the United States of America, on the planet of Earth. Welcome to Purgatory. Well, without the torment. Yet.” The old man laughed.

The name meant nothing to him but he understood Earth and the USA. Again, thoughts drifted across the edge of his consciousness as if his mind were trying to recall the memories but the connections were lost.

“What happened to me?”

“I’m glad you asked,” the old man said, skipping away towards the disc. “Stay seated. Let me explain,” he said, as if he were giving a tour. “You, good sir, were on the way to shoot up a school, but, luckily for you-”

His eyes widened. “Wait! What?! Why the hell would I do that?”

It was strange. He knew what a school was. Understood how to use a gun. But he couldn’t recall either being in a school or holding a gun. The knowledge was there in his head but not the experiences. It was like knowing how to paint but having no visions to share.

The old man waved at the disc. “Recognise the girl sleeping there?”

He shook his head.

“She’s your younger sister, Hannah. Eighteen. And she had a friend, Madison, also eighteen, that you’ve known for about a year. Now, I hate to break it to you but you kinda…had a thing for Maddie. Asked her out. She said no.

 “She wasn’t the first to say no to you, but you were going to make sure she was the last. One of those ‘if I can’t have her, no-one can’ situations. Luckily for you, you had a crash on the way to the school. Left you quadriplegic, brain-damaged and in a coma.”

He shifted uncomfortably in his seat and stared at the disc. If he couldn’t recognise the comatose man before, he sure didn’t recognise him now. Didn’t want to recognise him. Hitting on his little sister’s friend? School shooting? He searched his memory for any hints of such darkness, but found nothing. He remembered nothing.

“You’re lying.”

“Am I?” the old man smirked at him. Looking into the old man’s red eyes was unnerving, like he knew secrets that he wouldn’t reveal.

He turned back to the disc, looked at the younger girl – his sister. If what the old man said was true, he had been on his way to kill her friend and there she was, face puffy from the tears she had cried. He looked at his mother holding his hand, as if she were praying for him to come back. Perhaps they didn’t know what he had been planning. Perhaps they had as many questions for him as he did. His mind was completely blank. He’d like to think he wasn’t the kind of person this old man was insinuating but he had no memory to confirm it.

“If I really planned to do that, maybe the crash wasn’t a bad thing. Maybe it was justice.”

“Maybe it was. Maybe it was the fate of the gods for you to end up like that.” The old man looked at him and smiled. “But what if you could have another chance?”

“What do you mean?”

“What would you do if you had the choice between returning to your body as it is right now,” the old man twisted his body and swept an arm out to motion towards the disc before turning back to him, “or returning to your life before you asked Madison out?”

The offer was intriguing but made no sense to him. He still wasn’t sure he was the person in the disc, and even if he were, how exactly could this man return him to a time before now?

When was now, for that matter? Where was here? He glanced at the endless expanse of white. “What is this place?”

The old man made pistol motions several times, like a cowboy in a shootout, before he stopped and pointed a single finger towards him with a wink. “This is the world between worlds. Like I said, Purgatory, without the torment. Except, the worlds you can go to aren’t heaven or hell. Well, not literally, anyway.”

The old man gestured to the disc, and the image of the comatose man blurred, replaced with the image of a planet that looked like Earth at first glance, though on closer inspection, he saw that it wasn’t Earth at all. It seemed to have less water, less clouds and greenery, but most noticeably, from north to south was a vast region of black desert that divided the planet in two.

“This is Cytheria, a planet in the outer reaches of the Andromeda galaxy. It’s a game-world.”

“A game-world?” he asked.

“Yeah. Gain experience, progress through levels, acquire skills, increase your advantages, become as powerful as you can? Like a game.

“See, Cytheria’s inhabitants have been in a centuries-long war with entities from other worlds that invaded their lands. What Cytheria, and many others like it need, are heroes. Heroes to help them fight. What I do, is offer the chance of redemption for those in positions like yourself.

“See, here, you have an opportunity. You’re not the only one. Billions of souls, across billions of worlds, in circumstances similar to yours, given an opportunity for another chance. Granted, not all of them planned to do what you were planning but then there’s plenty that did worse.

“Now, you could go back to that hospital bed. No memories. No guilt. Just a broken body and a lost mind. Or, you can go to Cytheria, live an amazing life, become a hero of the people and then, you get another choice. Stay in Cytheria and never return to your life or you get to go back to before it all went wrong.”

 “What would happen to me on Earth, if I chose to remain in Cytheria?”

“Nothing. Right now, you’re an empty shell there anyway. The heart’s pumping but the engine’s not there. Your soul, the essence of your being, is right here. You’d get a new body on Cytheria. On Earth, you’d remain comatose until your body withered away.”

The offer was tempting. His eyes remained on the world inside the disc as he pondered on the options, but his thoughts turned to his mother and sister. Did he have a father too? How would they cope if he never came back? Did it even matter?

“Can I see me again?” he asked. The image in the disc blurred again and Tyler Smith returned, comatose, mother and sister at his side. As he looked upon the image, wondering what this new world might hold for him, he was fairly certain that he didn’t want to go back as he was now. Quadriplegic. Brain-dead. A mother spending days and nights, holding his hand, praying beyond hope that he would return. A sister, spending days and nights crying, blaming herself for having introduced him to her friend. It might have been a deserved punishment for him but it wasn’t fair to them.

And he hadn’t done the deed, had he? Intention and action were two very different things. The line between them might be thin but it was there.

“What would I have to do?”

The old man smiled, mouth curling towards his eyes. “I won’t lie to you. It won’t be easy. You’ll arrive in the Kingdom of Aleria, on the borders with The Rift, the black region you see here. Over the course of your journey, you need to become a hero and join the armies or lead your own to take back the Rift. As long as it exists, its threatens the Cytherians. Fortunately, the Rift Lords don’t seem interested in encroaching upon the rest of the world for now but it’s only a matter of time. We need to break through first. If we don’t who knows what might happen?

“Unfortunately, some heroes have settled in, carved out empires for themselves and skirmish with each other. Others have decided to master professions and live simple lives. Only a few are still searching for a way to take the Rift. With enough bodies, they think they’ll have the power to move forwards and to convince the other heroes to join them.”

He took a look at the image of himself again. If he helped to overcome these Rift Lords, he’d get another chance. Get to go back to before he made that choice. A clean slate. A chance to do things properly. Or, the chance for a new life altogether. A new world. A new life. A new beginning.

His mind was made up.

“So how would this work?”

“Is that a yes?” the old man said.

“Yes.”

“You’re absolutely sure?”

He had a final look at himself, asleep on the hospital bed, hooked up to the machines.

“I’m sure. I’ll go to Cytheria. I’ll become a hero.

“And I’ll win.”

The old man looked at him and smiled, hands rubbing together in glee. “That I would like to see. Perhaps you’re just the right kind of crazy to make it work.

“Okay, first things first. Do you want the simple tutorial or the advanced tutorial?”

“What’s the difference?”

“That I can’t tell you but look at it as a leap of faith. You’re going to a new world. You’re going to be making a lot of leaps of faith.”

“Give me the advanced tutorial,” he said. He needed as much information as he could get if he was going to make this work. He just hoped the tutorial wasn’t boring.

“As you wish,” the Gamesmaster said. “You can’t choose a different race or gender, so you’ll spawn as a human male, looking as you do now. You can choose a different name, if you wish. Anything you want, fifty character limit.”

Imtheawesomestherothatseverheroed came to mind.

“Can I change my name after?”

“No.”

“Tyler Smith is fine.”

“Okay. Human. Male. Tyler Smith. Once you’re there, if you say ‘status’, it will open up your UI and you’ll be able to navigate from there. Are you ready?”

He nodded.

“Before you go, I should warn you about one thing. If you die in Cytheria, that’s it. There’s no going back, not even to your current body.”

He nodded again.

“Then I guess I better not die.”

I've been having terrible insomnia and getting about 4 hours of sleep at night.  So I took a heavy does of melatonin last night and was still drowsy this morning and stayed in bed too long.

After that, I was shocked to have to scrape the ice off my car in APRIL in the south.  Between these two things, I was late to work.

Then my stomach was upset from the poor sleep plus drinking coffee on an empty stomach to counter the drowsiness.

Then my wife spends an hour the morning texting me upset about something I forgot to do at home that I missed, becauseI was so drowsy.

Then when it is time for me to go to lunch, I realize my wallet is gone.  I spend about 20 minutes panicking and searching the building before I finally find it. My stress is already at a breaking point now.

Now I can finally go the the cafeteria and buy the hamburger I pre-ordered.  I buy the burger and go back to my desk to eat it, only to find that some dumbass in the kitchen put all the contents of the burger in the container with no bun!  I have never had to specify before that I want my burger to actually be a burger.  I took it back to the cafeteria to tell someone, but all the staff there have already left, since it is 12:45.

I decided to just eat it with a fork, and spent the next several minutes trying to one, since the cafeteria didn't have any.  By the time I found a fork, the food was already gross and cold, so I just gave up.

I went back to tbe cafeteria to buy a Dr. Pepper.  I don't normally drink soda, but I just really wanted one after everything.  Of course, they are out of stock, since they seem to only refill  the coolers every other week.

Now it is only 1PM and I have to figure out how to get myself through the rest of this day without jumping off the roof.  And it's only Monday.  I just hope I can sleep well tonight, because I can't take melatonin again.",1,1744049679.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1jts3id,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jts3id/time_looped_chapter_87/,Time Looped (Chapter 87),"“An alliance…” Will repeated.

That explained why no one had interfered during his hunt of the goblin. Even so, he would have preferred if the biker had made the proposal to him, rather than Helen.

“I don’t think it’s just the numbers,” the girl said, sipping a new variant of tea that she had ordered. It tasted a bit too bitter for her taste, but was definitely different. “I’d say there’s a class requirement of some sort. They insisted on us two. Alex and Jace were an afterthought.”

Will could see that. At the same time, he’d be lying if he said that he didn’t find the thought of taking down the archer appealing. So far, the entity remained a nearly supernatural figure capable of killing off anyone of his group, even Danny back when he had been alive. It wasn’t in the least surprising that he managed to rank in the top tier during the contest phase.

“And Danny never said anything about that?” Will asked, even if he knew he was on thin ice.

“Apparently, he kept it to himself. All part of eternity, I guess.”

“What is?”

“The secrets.”

Will felt as if a knife had been stuck in his gut and twisted several times. He, too, was keeping way more secrets than he would have liked. Looking back, it had always started small. A skill here, an agreement with Danny there. Before he knew it, he had set loose Danny’s reflection into the world, obtained several unique skills, and whatnot. It would take him an hour to go through all the secrets he’d kept from Helen, and that was if she didn’t kill him before he was done.

“Everyone has secrets,” he said in a somber tone.

“That’s part of eternity. Secrets bring individual strength and group weakness.”

Will wasn’t certain whether that was deep or not, but nodded all the same. The more he sat there, the more he wanted to tell her all about Danny, but at the same time, the more he was afraid of how she’d react.

“So, what do you think?” She looked at him. “Do we tell the guys?”

“Yes,” Will said after a while. “The more we are, the better. Plus, we’ll have a few more on our side for when the alliance breaks down.”

“I thought as much. I’ll tell them next loop.”

“Next? Why not this one?”

“What’s the point? They’re already doing their solo challenges. What good will there be worrying about other stuff?”

That was true. Maybe Will would tell her about Danny after Helen had finished her solo challenge.

“Did the acrobat say anything more? About the challenges, I mean?”

“She wasn’t very chatty. There was one more thing, though. She said we should save ourt coins. Seems the merchants in the next phase are a lot better. We can buy skills from there.”

“That’s good to know. I bet we’ll probably get something nice for killing the archer. Each boss dropped some useful skills, possibly a weapon, too.”

There was no chance that they’d get the weapon. From the few similar fights they’d had so far, the weapon was only one, and likely the other members of the alliance would claim it.

“We’ll see.” Helen finished her tea. “I’ll get going. I want to finish my challenge fast, so I focus on mirror hunting.”

Hidden mirrors didn’t drop anything exceptional, but it was better than doing nothing. Besides, they could always be sold for coins at the crow’s nest merchant.

“Sure. I’ll take care of the bill.”

“Just like a date.” Helen smiled, then left the coffee shop.

The comment would have been appreciated a lot more if Will didn’t have so many other things on his mind. The information the girl had just provided had changed everything. Up to a moment ago, his main goal was to become strong enough to take on the other looped. But above all, to face Danny. The sudden alliance had marked a new target, putting Will’s personal gripes on the back burner.

“Hey, don’t worry about it,” the barista said all of a sudden.

“Huh?” Will stared at him.

“It’s always confusing the first few times. I’ve seen it more times than I can remember. You have no idea how often couples come here to break up or make up. The main thing is to keep things calm and in perspective. Never be lacking, but don’t go too fast, either.”

“Err, sure…”

Pleased with his advice of the day, the barista returned with the bill and a very small box of chocolates for Will to buy. With money being a temporary issue, Will bought it, then tucked it away in his backpack and left the coffee shop.

As he walked to his challenge mirror, the boy tried to clear his mind of any needless thoughts. Sadly, that wasn’t as easy as it seemed. By the time he had arrived at the small grocery shop, his stress levels had increased to the point that had completely forgotten that the store owner didn’t remember him.

“Looking for anything?” The man asked, eyeing Will with suspicion.

“Err, a fresh,” the boy said out of habit.

“Are you sure? That’s pretty expensive.”

“Yeah.” Will took out his card. “I know.”

The moment of confidence proved enough to sway the store owner, who gave him one more look, then went to the juice squeezer.

“What fresh do you want?” he asked.

“The classic,” Will replied.

The option was accepted, and the man stretched to get a few oranges from the nearby pile. Soon enough, the sound of a small mechanical motor began, as the juice was being squeezed out of the fruits.

“Are you from the area?” the shopkeeper asked.

“No, but I study nearby.” Will ventured closer to the mirror. It was huge, as always, with multiple postcards on it.

“Ah. Probably tired of all the artificial things they sell there. Am I right?”

Instead of an answer, Will reached out and tapped the reflective surface. The shop, and everything in it, vanished. All of a sudden, Will found himself floating in the middle of an endlessness of twisted reflections, as if he had been transported into a giant fractal. He tried to look into the distance, but felt as if something was trying to claw his eyes out. A single square mirror floated before him, providing a bastion of sanity.

 

**ROGUE CHALLENGE**

 

**Which side of the mirror do you wish to emerge from?**

**INNER / OUTER**

 

This was the first time the goblin skill had kicked in, transforming the start of the challenge into a miniature riddle.

Some explanations would have been nice, but eternity was stingy with its hints. The only way to obtain them was to find and tap the mirrors that provided them, and even then, there were no assurances there wouldn’t be further prerequisites present.

“Inner,” the boy said.

Both messages vanished, and he was transported into some sort of small hall. The walls, floor, and ceiling were made of white stone, like in a medieval castle.

Mirrors were placed on the walls—ten feet from each other—providing the only source of light. Further ahead, a double door was visible, indicating the way to the challenge. Knowing better, Will went to the nearest mirror and tapped it.

 

**HINT 1**

**You can only rest or leave after completing a floor.**

 

That partially resembled the wolf challenge. Of course, back then there had been only waves without any actual structures. 

Eager to get a clear picture, Will went past the remaining two mirrors on that same side of the room, tapping each in turn.

 

**HINT 2**

**Rewards obtained in the course of a floor can be given away to increase the significance of the final floor reward.**

 

**HINT 3**

**Upon restarting the challenge, you can continue from the floor you reached or restart from the beginning.**

 

Seeing that nothing in the hints stood out, Will went to the other side of the room and tapped the remaining three mirrors. As expected, those turned out to be the actual rules of the challenge.

 

**ROGUE CHALLENGE (1/3)**

**Complete all nine levels of the rogue tower, completing one floor at a time.**

 

**ROGUE CHALLENGE (2/3)**

**A floor is considered complete once all enemies on it are defeated. Upon completing the floor, a reward will be granted based on the candidate’s performance.**

 

**ROGUE CHALLENGE (3/3)**

**You are only allowed to use rogue skills.** 

 

That last bit was a bit of an issue. Will’s copycat skill was going to be a hindrance. The principle of the entire thing was clear: the goal of the challenge was simultaneously to teach a person how to play a class, as well as limit the use of overpowered combinations. Suspiciously, there was no explicit mention of enemy types, suggesting there might be more than one.

With all the messages revealed, Will pressed his mirror fragment against them, collecting the hints as he did. It was a shame that he couldn’t smash them, but the mirror copy skill wouldn’t bring him anything in this challenge. Maybe he’d save that for the thief one. 

“Here I come.” The boy grabbed the right handle of the double door, then pulled it open.

His action was followed by a leap to the right, and just in time to escape the series of darts that flew through the opening. 

*I knew it!* Will thought, drawing his own throwing knives.

In a rogue tower, the most likely enemies he’d face would be other rogues. Why did it have to be a tower, though?

Will dashed across the open door. He expected to see a single humanoid enemy across the threshold. Instead, he saw about a dozen. To make it stranger, they weren’t neither human nor goblin, but living mannequins dressed up in rogue outfits. The complete lack of facial features was most disturbing, though it didn’t prevent Will from sinking two knives in the nearest rogue’s head.

The blades struck their target with a wooden sound, causing it to collapse to the floor with a thud.

*Doesn’t take much to kill them, at least*, Will thought as he dashed back across the opening, knife in hand.

This time, none of the mannequins were visible, all of them lying in wait. Clearly, in order to win, he’d have to take the initiative.

Without a moment’s hesitation, Will took his backpack off and tossed it through the door. 

Knives centered on it from all directions, quickly transforming it into pincushion.

Not thinking of the consequences, the boy charged in immediately after. Knives flew at knives, missing each other, but striking the knives’ owners. In Will’s case, his evasion skill kicked in, saving him from a quick failure, if only just.

Two more marionettes fell to the floor, reducing the total number to eight.

Gritting his teeth, Will performed a series of side leaps, then charged at the nearest enemy. 

That almost proved to be a costly mistake. The way the rogues fought was consistently from a distance. None had attempted to approach Will, and in the instance he had, the rogue had immediately leaped back, continuing with ranged attacks. In a bizarre way, it almost felt as if Will was facing a much less skilled archer.

*Evade, leap, attack. Evade, leap, attack.* Will kept repeating to himself.

It was a terrible way to fight, only further proving how woefully unprepared he was. The marionettes used the simplest of actions. Their speed was considerably slower than Will’s, and their evasion skills were close to nonexistent. And even then, as a whole, they were doing a lot better than the boy. With the amount of effort he put in, he was supposed to have dealt with them in less than a minute. In practice, he wasn’t sure he’d manage to do so in an hour.

“You pieces of shit!” Will shouted to let off some steam. Of the ten knives he had thrown, three managed to hit the torso of his opponent, rendering him motionless.

*One more!* Will told himself. That was the only way he’d beat them. As long as he remained alive and focused on a single enemy, there was no way he’d lose.

For the time I was there, he paid for everything, whatever I wanted to eat, coffees, sweets. Please note that I know he doesn't have a lot of money (left a poor country to find work in Dubai). He even bought me this ring I liked. He took me to the movies, all over the city, talked with me for hours and hours over coffees. He introduced me to this friends. He paid for all of my taxis. He even gave me his card to pay for things when he wasn't with me. He picked me from the airport, dropped me off all the way to the passport control point. I was in such awe. He was kind, caring, and charming. He is also an absolute dream looks-wise, he has these dimples, a sparkle in his eye and such a warmth. I fell hard and fast. I was in a fairy tale. I interpreted all these gestures wrong, as there are cultural difference on how to treat female friends. This is a normal way to treat female friends. Well I told him my feelings and he only thinks of me as his 'best' friend. He cried when I told him I don't think I can be friends anymore. Well, I told him we can stay friends but I need to take some time away from him. I would love to stay friends with him, he is such a good person - look at how he treats his friends.

1jts310,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ooziboiii/comments/1jts310/mind_eater_first_contact/,[MIND EATER] [FIRST CONTACT],"The hum of the city, a low thrum that usually soothed Sarah, now grated on her nerves. It vibrated through the floorboards of her apartment, a constant, unsettling percussion to the whispers that had begun to plague her. At first, they were faint, barely perceptible – a rustling in the background of her thoughts, like the faintest brush of a phantom's wing. They were inconsequential murmurs, snippets of conversations she couldn't quite place, words that dissolved into meaninglessness the moment she tried to grasp them. But they were persistent. They insinuated themselves into the spaces between her breaths, into the quiet moments between heartbeats. 

The whispers started subtly. A misplaced object. A flickering light. The feeling of being watched, even when she knew she was alone. The apartment, once her sanctuary, now felt alien, charged with an unseen energy. The familiar scent of old books and brewing coffee was overlaid with a metallic tang, a faint coppery taste lingering on the back of her tongue, a taste she couldn't explain. She’d chalked it up to stress, to the relentless pressure of her job, the mounting loneliness of city life. But the stress, she realized with a growing unease, wasn’t easing. It was intensifying, twisting into something darker, something more sinister. 

One evening, nestled amongst the soft glow of her reading lamp, surrounded by the comforting weight of her books, the whispers intensified. They were no longer just background noise; they were a chorus, a cacophony of voices weaving themselves into the fabric of her reality. They spoke in a language she didn't understand, yet somehow, viscerally, she comprehended their chilling intent. It was a language of dread, of impending doom, woven from the threads of her deepest anxieties and darkest fears. The words, sharp and jagged, sliced through the quiet of her apartment, leaving trails of icy fear in their wake. 

Her sleep became a torment. The whispers followed her into her dreams, transforming the familiar comfort of her bed into a suffocating prison. Her dreams were no longer gentle escapes into fantasy but nightmarish tapestries woven from fragmented memories and surreal landscapes. She found herself in places she'd never been, living lives she'd never lived, experiencing emotions she'd never felt. One recurring dream, particularly vivid and disturbing, saw her standing before a vast, obsidian mirror, her reflection twisting and contorting, morphing into something grotesque and alien. The face staring back was not hers, but a distorted parody, a grotesque mockery of humanity. 

The whispers began to affect her waking hours, subtly altering her surroundings. The layout of her apartment seemed to shift, familiar pathways becoming labyrinths, rooms appearing and disappearing as if guided by an unseen hand. Her memories, too, began to fracture. Childhood events, once clear and vibrant, now dissolved into hazy sketches, their edges blurred, details melting like ice cream on a hot summer day. She found herself remembering moments that couldn't have happened, memories that were clearly not her own. Faces flickered in her mind’s eye, fleeting images of people she couldn't identify, places she’d never visited, experiences that felt both utterly foreign and profoundly familiar. 

The sensation of being watched intensified. She felt eyes upon her, unseen, yet undeniably present. It was a feeling that seeped into her bones, chilling her to the marrow. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end, even in the summer heat. She’d jump at the slightest noise, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird. The shadows in her apartment seemed to writhe and shift, taking on malevolent forms, distorting themselves in the periphery of her vision. Simple everyday tasks—making coffee, brushing her teeth, checking her emails—became exercises in terror, each action fueled by a growing sense of impending doom. 

One morning, she woke to find her reflection in the bathroom mirror completely different. Her eyes were a shade darker, more intense, the pupils dilated, almost black. Her skin felt cold to the touch, strangely pale, and her pulse beat with an unnatural rhythm, a rapid, erratic thumping that echoed the whispers. A thin, almost invisible scar had appeared on her left wrist, a jagged line that pulsed faintly with a light that seemed to come from within her flesh. Panic seized her, a cold, clammy fear that wrapped around her like a shroud. She was changing. 

The whispers evolved. They were no longer just fragments of sound but fully formed sentences, pronouncements, commands whispered just beyond the threshold of her conscious mind. They spoke of vast, unimaginable spaces, of a reality beyond human comprehension. They spoke of a power that dwarfed everything she'd ever known, a power that was slowly, insidiously, taking hold of her. The words weren't spoken in any known language; they were feelings, raw and visceral, transmitted directly to her soul. Fear, dread, and an insidious sense of inevitability. 

The apartment became a prison, yet escape felt impossible. The city, once a symbol of freedom and opportunity, now felt like a vast, inescapable cage. Each passing day brought new horrors, new transformations. The physical changes were subtle at first, but they accelerated. Her movements became more jerky, her coordination less certain. Her body felt alien, as if it no longer belonged to her. The whispers, once a mere annoyance, became a constant, tormenting presence, shaping her thoughts, her actions, her very being. They were chipping away at her sanity, dismantling her sense of self, one subtle whisper at a time. 

One night, amidst the swirling chaos of hallucinations and fragmented memories, a voice, clearer than any of the others, spoke directly to her. ""You are a story,"" it hissed, the words like shards of ice against her skin. ""And I am your author."" Then, a terrifying realization dawned on her – she was not only being consumed by this entity, but she was also being watched by someone else, someone outside of this horrific experience. The fourth wall shattered. She was aware, in a bone-chilling way, that she was a character in a narrative, her very existence controlled by forces beyond her comprehension.

CRAZY","For some context, I'm in college and I've always questioned my sexuality and I've always been very indecisive, so it's safe to say that I'm bisexual but I hate going by labels so I suppose I'm just up for whatever, I've had my share of experiences in the past with the same gender but at the time of our relationship, that was all deep in the past and I wanted to forget it all. however, me and my ex broke up in February and I think it's safe to say everything that's going on, is faaaaar from finished. But here's my story so far

I got with this girl in April of 2024 and before and during the first few months of our relationship, everything was great, we loved each other and would always laugh when we were around one another. But later on, I began to question whether what Id gotten into was a friendship which was just under the wrong title. This is for a few reasons. The first reason was that she was VERY committed and seemed to want plan our entire lives ahead of the game, including weddings, houses, children etc. All of these kinds of conversations would kinda make me look into my future and feel almost trapped, like I'd signed a waiver telling me I MUST live this exact life and there is no way out. I don't know why I felt like this over someone I loved but it just seemed like a lot of pressure for someone of my age (17 at the time). 

Another issue was that I have had a girl best friend who moved away, the full way across the country to manchester due to deep family issues, and me and her had been best friends for years before I even knew my ex, and in our relationship, she would never ever let it go. She would always ask old friends of mine about this girl and try to pry info out of them, almost as if she WANTED to find something to argue about, because that was her mentality. I do understand the suspicion behind me being best friends with another girl but she hardly ever said it to my face and would always try to bring our friends (Originally my friends from high school) into our drama. 

Around two or three times in our year long relationship, I would travel across the country to meet this long term best friend of mine and stay at her house for a few days, for clarification, I would tell my gf every time I went up and we would sit down and talk about the situation, she would rightfully be anxious that I'm going to another girls house for the weekend but I'd always assure her that we were only friends (common sense should say that if me and my best friend were gonna date, we would have started dating YEARS before this). So I would always tell her that nothing would happen between me and her and we would reach a conclusion every time, both in agreement. 

Every single time I'd be in Manchester, my girlfriend would always send me a LONG ass message, telling me how worried she is about if I'm doing stuff with my best friend and it would 99% of the time lead to a huge argument and we would be at a stalemate until I got back home, to which we would see each other in person again and joke around and everything would be fine. 

If I was ever up in Manchester my best friend would always tell me that she sees something bad in my girlfriend, and that she's not healthy for me Becuase she starts all of these arguments, which is my next point.

Over almost ANY of my personal opinions that I'd share, she would cause a huge argument over it. I remember being in class and my table had a conversation that ""if you had to kiss a celebrity of the same gender, who would it be"" so I (pretty fairly) said 'kit Harrington' and she went off on a huge rant, asking me if I was still gay or if I still have feelings for guys etc, and this argument never really went away.

Introducing some more people, I was in a group with one other guy and 2 girls, the guy and one of the girls were dating and the other girl never felt anything towards men, let's call this group the silly sausages. So I would hang out with the silly sausages once or twice on a pretty even 2 week basis, we would hang at one of our friend's houses and always watch a horror film or two. And quite deep into our relationship me and the silly sausages decided to invite my girlfriend to hang out with us one time. The day went good but over the following days these friends would each tell me 'i see something strange in her', especially the girls since 'girls know girls'.

Anytime somebody said they saw something strange in my gf I wouldn't think anything of it since I loved her and 'I don't care what anyone else thinks'.

Time came around when concerts started going on sale and me and my gf went to 2 of them, both in October of 2024, 2 days apart. For one I had lent her a shirt with the band name on it Becuase she didn't have any merch so I gave it to her just for that one show. Besides that, earlier in the year I booked tickets to Billie Eilish and id asked my gf if she wanted to go with me and she said she couldnt and gave me the excuse of 'i haven't got enough money atm' which is valid, so rightfully so, I invited my best mate (the girl in Manchester). I thought that since my gf and by best mate have a big deal with each other, I'll tell my gf that I'm going with my cousin (of the same name as my best mate, by coincidence), just to save us from another argument. I thought it was a good idea so when comic con came around I asked my gf and she gave me the same excuse why she couldn't go, so invited the girl from 'the silly sausages' who isn't into guys cuz we both liked films etc. I used the same excuse in that I was going with my cousin yet again simply to avoid the arguments (which in the relationship, were genuinely CONSTANT) 

A bit further near the end of the relationship me, the silly sausages, my gf and a few other close friends were sitting in a coffee shop (bear in mind I never gave my gf any details on my past relationships with other men Becuase it wouldn't be necessary) I go to the toilet with my guy friend cuz we both needed to go, and my gf and one of the girls from the group stand outside and one of the girls mentions one of my past experiences with a guy (Becuase at the time I was open with it and I foolishly told a lot of people a lot of the details etc). This, being new news to my gf, caused a very deep and embarrassing conversation and I had to explain who he was, what happened and everything in between, my legs were shaking the whole time And I hated every second of it. But we came to the conclusion that it was in the past and that I've changed. (She held onto the story and uses it against me later on Becuase that's just what she does and I knew she would do it) 

Many many arguments and make ups, and trips back and forth from Manchester later, I was sat with 2 of my college friends, alone. My girlfriend wasn't around at the time And she'd booked us tickets to see Lana del Rey in 2025 whilst I was on holiday a month or two prior. And I spoke my mind to these friends and just said ""guys... I feel like the only reason I'm still with *her* is Becuase she has the tickets to see Lana del rey, otherwise I'm fed up with the arguing Becuase it's making me miserable and putting too much stress on me"". They both agreed and told me she wasn't good for me so when my gf walked into the class, she kept asking me what was wrong and we went outside to chat.

I told her that the commitment to our relationship was extremely heavy and it was putting way too much pressure on me and that I can't chain myself down to such a fixed path in life Becuase she'd plan our entire life all the time. To cut to the chase, I broke up with her that day and we went our seperate ways home and left on (what I thought) good terms, I was still gonna see Lana del Rey and we were gonna be friends.

Sidenote - So she had a tendency to make up stories in her head and believe them which caused her to overthink every situation, so during the breakup, i told her not to make up stories or reasons I ended the relationship and that I'd told her everything she needed to know, however she did not listen at all and would constantly be asking everyone questions about my past life, who my closest friends were, who my past relationships were etc.

One night which I will never forget, me and the silly sausages went to an escape room, then to a KFC (bear in mind my ex used to work at this KFC, but she quit months before this) then, one of the girls in the group said ""how crazy would it be if *my ex* showed up cuz she used to work here"" then she actually did walk through the doors and told the other guy in the group that she came in to get her sister a wrap (remember this info). Then me and the 2 other girls sat at a table quite far away and my mate (the male one) stayed behind and spoke to my ex.

My mate then came back to the table and my ex left, no wrap in hand, not even a bag. She never ordered anything. And my mate sat down with his food after half an hour of talking and told us everything she said, he has invited her to sit with us but she said ""no I hate them, urm sorry, I hate HIM"". This really annoyed the two other girls Becuase they had done nothing but help my ex when she was upset in the past and she's just gone and said she hates them, I don't think she meant 'just me' I reckon she MEANT 'i hate them' and realized who she was talking to so quickly switched up her words

Another thing that happened was that she was asking this friend all about whether I was gay, if I was trying to get with *Manchester best friend* or if I was trying to get with one of the girls of this group and she would not leave him alone that whole time. 

We all came the the conclusion that she stalked the one of the friend's or my Snapchat locations Becuase a couple of days later she had a go at me for doing an escape room with the silly sausages when I said me and her were gonna plan one (during the relationship, which by this point, was over), I never told her we did an escape room, nobody did, and yet she knew?? Then she shows up at the same KFC as us? Then she leaves without buying the wrap for her sister like she said?? And once we all left the KFC, we looked at the car far behind and on the right of us in the car park which had 3 people in it, 2 in the front, one in the back. And we all said ""that person in the back looks like *my ex*"" so we stayed in the car park, acting like we were eating, I called *Manchester friend* Becuase she loved drama so the 4 of us plus *Manchester friend on the phone* are in the car and we come up with the idea that if the 2 girls go to put rubbish in the bin, they can get a better look at who is in the car. So when they leave to go to the bin, the girl in the back suspiciously ducks down so we can't see her.

The male friend in the silly sausages then snaps *my ex*, to try and find out where she is, and she sends a snap back saying she's at home in her room, however id been to her house many many times and the light fixture that was on the ceiling in the snap, was not the one in her room, so we all reckon she had fake snaps and she sent one to this friend as almost a decoy.

After we wait in the carpark for about 45 minutes we decided to leave and as we turn the first corner me and my friend both see the car leave and head the right direction as if u were going to my ex's house.

 a week or two after, me and my college best mate (the only other guy from the Silly Sausages friend group) were in a lesson and I was talking about how much freeer I felt (my ex wasn't in the room at the time). My friend was talking all about how he's glad she's out of our lives Becuase he couldnt stand her attitude and hated the way she treated me so my friend did not like her at all. Then all of a sudden she walks in and sits down. She's quiet for a little bit and then turns to my friend and just says ""so why do you hate me then"". She basically sent the whole class into silence and my friend just mumbled something like 'i don't know I just don't like you' and she then turned to me and repeated herself saying 'what so you hate me too?? Is this how it is? Is this how you really feel about me?"" Then she started fully shouting at us telling us how heartbroken she felt, with the entire class and the teacher listening in, then she stormed out.

This annoyed my friend so much since he'd just been  ridiculed in front of everyone and that's when we both just thought ""we need her fully out of our lives Becuase she isn't gonna give up on this breakup""

After that things died down but also got kinda worse. She blocked anybody who had anything to do with me on Snapchat and Instagram and whatever else she could, but she never blocked me on Pinterest, which I found odd Becuase she would always question me on my Pinterest Becuase I'm an artist so there's a lot of nude drawing of men and women on there Becuase I was doing drawings about the human body at the time, so there was a lot of naked drawings on there etc, so shed always act off about that. So I found that interesting. Anyways, I had a tattoo inspo board on Pinterest and one of the tattoos was on the 'little finger's side of the hand, right on the edge, and it was just words, and I wanted my favorite Lana del rey album tattooed there. A few days later she comes into college late and rumors go around saying she has a tattoo, I ask a close friend of hers what the tattoo is of and she said "" it says honeymoon, it's on the side of her hand and she says it's her favorite Lana del Rey album"". That really got to me, Becuase during our relationship, Honeymoon was 'our' album becuase id had a birthday party themed around it so it was quite significant to us both, so why she would steal one of my designs and get that specific album tattooed is absolutely mental to me.

One final thing she did , which was literally the other day, was (remember I lent her that band T-shirt for that concert?) well, j never got it back after the breakup and she wore it into college the other day and I'm looking at demanding to have that shirt back Becuase I never told her she could keep it and it would be common courtesy to give it back.

That's pretty much the whole story though so Thanks for reading it, I'll update this if anything else happens.",1,1744049588.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
