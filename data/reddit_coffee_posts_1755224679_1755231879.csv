1mqnbmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1mqnbmr/tesla_emergency_braking_almost_caused_an_accident/,Tesla emergency braking almost caused an accident!,"To preface, I sometimes park the same way and this feature was turned off or just set on late warning as it made the car abruptly stop on day two since ownership. 

I was trying to parallel parking fairly quickly as I didn’t want to cause traffic as the parking spot was near by T intersection, allowed parking as per usual. 

I drove partially in and out of the parking spot between two cars as it was big enough to do so, my Tesla emergency broke right before me and stopped blocking the lane as I was still in the right lane. I hope this makes sense. The PROBLEM is that I had turned this feature off since day two and I never used the emergency brake assist as it did similar thing earlier in my ownership. I thought it was idiotic so I either turned off or set on warning and late. Someone at TESLA decided that it’s smart to set this to early and on with the last update. Tesla, what in the world. Seriously someone fire this smart A$$.

1) I am the only driver
2) I know exactly what setting the car was on
3) this has occurred once before in different instance hence why it was turned off/set to warning only

I’m glad that the cars behind were turning right and two I didn’t have hot coffee in the centre cup holder. 

I’m sure someone will find this feature useful but I think it’s too aggressive and often overreacting. 

Additionally the FSD lane assist while FSD is off is also overreacting on unmarked road. 

Battery degradation is real and 270 miles is more like 150. 

Tesla service is overpriced and the reps can be a hit or miss. 

I’m sharing this to hopefully help someone and also for TESLA to fix their Sh!t!

1mqnb9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/gastricsleeve/comments/1mqnb9g/hungerdehydration_despite_solid_intake/,Hunger/dehydration despite solid intake?,"I am three weeks post op, doing purees/soft foods for another 2-3 weeks. I am struggling with a couple things that my dietitian and surgeon have not encountered before and I am hoping people here might be able to help. 

The first is I have symptoms of dehydration - dark yellow urine, dry mouth and lips, and desperate thirst frequently through the day. However, I am drinking 1.5-2L of water daily, with additional fluids from smoothies and milky (single shot) coffees. I drank equivalent amounts of water and coffee pre op and was never dehydrated. I have added in some electrolytes, which is helping a bit, but not enough. 

The second is I am so starving so much of the time, and especially after eating. The starving feelings start in the afternoon, maybe 2pm, and are truly intrusive in the evenings. It feels super stressful. I don’t think it is food noise or head hunger because the sensations are in my chest and throat and I am not focused on food at all, just washing the sensations would go away. 

Another factor is I have ME/CFS. No-one in my care team knows the condition well and I can find nothing online about how bariatric recovery should be managed alongside it. However, because it is a condition of dysfunctional energy metabolism, and because I used to get very symptomatic when I didn’t eat enough before surgery, I suspect the hunger may be my body telling me I am not eating enough. 

Does anyone, anywhere have any insights into any piece of this? I feel pretty isolated and overwhelmed by it. 

(I am drinking 1.5-2L of water a day, getting 60-80g protein each day, eating basically an egg, a homemade protein shake with milk, protein powder, banana and frozen fruit, two 250ml cappuccinos (single shot, no sugar added), and 30g of fish or chicken or pork. Calories each day are 500-600.)",1,1755231650.0,gastricsleeve,0,1.0,False

Roughly our time will be about 8am in Kennebunkport (plan to sleep at the travel plaza outside of town en route to our lodging in Freeport) We are traveling in our camper van, so will be up and out of there early. Looking for any parks, restaurants or cafes,  viewpoints, anything of general interest! 
Timing we have available is a good chunk of the day: 

• I’d imagine leaving travel plaza at 7-8am or so. 
•We’d like to be in Freeport by about 3-4pm so we can hit the grocery store there  before checking in where we are staying. 

As of now ideas I have are 
• grab a some pastries and coffee at Boulangerie, likely eat these and have coffees there 

• Go to Kennebunkport. Aware that not many business will be open at this time of day, maybe grab another coffee or tea and walk around/window shop

• Park (hopefully not an issue in the morning on a weekday?) and walk along ocean Avenue or drive along to view homes

•  I’ve seen others mention cape porpoise? What is there that we should see? 

• Head to Cape Elizabeth to Portland head light / fort Williams state park
> * two lights state park is just south of here, if we are doing good on time should we make this a stop as well? Or are we better spending our time at fort Williams / Portland head light? Looking to maximize some walking, any “trails” so therefore have assumed Portland head light area. (We will be in Portland for a half day later in the weekend so not looking to make a Portland stop this day) 

-  I see there is a farmers market on Thursdays (the day we will be there next week) in Yarmouth from 3-6! I love farmers markets so this would be a fun stop if it is a good market! 

• Have been recommended to Days Crabmeat and Lobster for lobster rolls on the way into Freeport so may hit that up, but I imagine we will be hungry for a lobster roll way before this point in the day! Trying to eat as much lobster as we can!

Here it is below - 

Dear (my name), 
 
I completely understand if your feelings have changed and you aren’t interested anymore but I did think you would at least tell me if you felt like that. I thought we were really comfortable together and could tell each other pretty much whatever was on our minds. Maybe it’s my fault and you don’t feel like that. Either way I’m not annoyed or anything I’m just quite confused, especially seeing as we went on two (in my opinion) really nice, meaningful dates. I was so happy on both of them and we seemed to hit it off. I made you laugh, you made me laugh and we talked and bonded over things that I have never bonded with anyone else about before. I really felt like this was special, and I still do think that it is. 
 
Either way I now understand you aren’t interested and that’s fine, I would never try and make you do anything you didn’t want to do. However, I do need to tell you something otherwise I know I will regret it.
 
When I first saw your profile back on the 16th June, I felt something I’ve never felt before and it’s impossible to put into words exactly what is was. I guess the closest thing I can say is that it felt like you were the girl I had been waiting for and there was an instant sense of connection. I don’t know if you felt a similar way but for me it felt so real and strong and with time that feeling only grew stronger. You probably think it’s crazy that I say that seeing as we hadn’t even spoken at that point but I can say with 100% certainty that I fell for you immediately and honestly I think it was love at first sight. I love everything about you. Your cute laugh, your humour, the passionate way you talk about your interests, your kindness and your incredible beauty (which I still can’t wrap my head around. How can you be so beautiful??). I really hope you know just how incredible you are. Don’t let anyone ever tell you different.
 
I don’t want you to think that this is just me trying to change your mind, because it’s not. I just know deep down that I have to let you know the way I truly feel and if I didn’t I would regret it.
 
I have loved getting to know you over the past 2 months and I am so so happy that I got to meet you in person. The truth is that when I saw you that day my feelings grew deeper than I ever thought possible. Seeing you get out of your car and instantly light up everything around you was surreal to see. I had gone over in my head many times what to say when I first saw you but my mind went blank. I think the only thing I could say is “Hey, how are you?” - I in fact wanted to tell you how incredible you looked but I didn’t want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything so held back on the immediate compliments, although looking back I really wish I had just told you how beautiful you looked. I remember it like it was yesterday - you were wearing your hair down with a hoodie on and some shorts and then of course your black converse high tops. You looked so incredibly beautiful and I don’t think I will ever see a woman as beautiful as you ever again. I remember on the walk you showed me that area where they filmed the Band of Brothers scene that your dad told you about and then we saw that sign that said something about ‘Big cats in (where we were)’. Remember you took a photo of it and then I did the same? I’m so glad I did because I accidentally took a Live Photo so it had a very short audio clip on it and in that audio I can hear you laughing. When I found that, I listened to it dozens of times and I couldn’t stop smiling. Your laugh is the most beautiful sound I have ever heard and I wish that I had a longer version of it. I think it is one of the things I’m going to miss most about you. However the thing I am going to miss most is the selfies you used to send. I don’t know how but each time you sent one, you looked even more beautiful in the next. I still think about the one you sent me on the train after the Billie Eilish concert. You looked so incredible I can’t even put into words how good you looked. I remember what I was doing when you sent it. I was watching the football highlights on YouTube and when I opened that photo I had to stop what I was doing. I turned off the tv and just stared at my phone for a good 5 minutes, just admiring you. I still remember the cute smile you were doing and how your eyes looked so wide and deeply into the camera. And your hair too, there’s something about it that is indescribable. I mean, everything about you is. How you’re that beautiful will forever be a mystery to me.
 
After we met and you had left, I was just sat overlooking a field and I had the widest smile on my face. For the first time in ages, I was truly happy which felt incredible. I knew at that moment I had found the girl of my dreams. Everything about you is perfect and I thought to myself ‘How the hell did I get so lucky?’. That feeling grew even deeper when we were out on our second date. I remember it vividly. We were walking towards the bride at (where we were), and you started telling me about how it was a protected monument and I could search it up online. Believe it or not, that was the moment when I truly knew I was deeply in love with you. Hearing you talk about something you’re so passionate about, whether its history or something else just instantly hooked me. To hear you talk about it, will stay with me forever. I remember when you said that I looked over at you and just smiled and thought “she is the one”. I also vividly remember standing on the bridge with you in silence just overlooking the river. I looked over at you and had the biggest smile on my face, in that moment the world truly stood still. I remember your hair blowing in the light breeze and your perfume drifting towards me. I have never felt something like that before. I can’t even explain how that moment made me feel. I wanted so badly to tell you how I felt and have you feel the same way but I couldn’t pluck up the courage.
 
I wish that we would have been able to go out more, my idea for our third date was to have dinner at a nice restaurant. I have thought it through so many times and envisioned the perfect night. I was going to pick you up from your house (if you were comfortable with me doing so) and bring flowers (I’m not sure what type you like so I was going to get the ones which reminded me most of you - the most beautiful ones) and we were going to walk to the restaurant together and have a really nice time. I always found that our conversations flowed so well and easily. Even if there were silences, I felt so comfortable in them with you which is something I can’t say for anyone else. I imagined we would then walk back to your house and I would walk you up to the door, give you a hug and say goodnight. In reality I would love to kiss you in that moment if you seemed to want the same but I wouldn’t pressure anything unwarranted. I will always regret not being able to give you flowers, I want more than anything to treat you the way you deserve.
 
Even though you don’t want things to evolve any further between us, you will always be the girl of my dreams no matter what happens. I can’t imagine anyone else ever making me feel the way that you do. If I had the chance, I would’ve kissed all your scars. 
 
I’m sorry this message is so long. I want to say more, a lot more but I fear that will make it much more painful. I hope I didn’t overwhelm you or make you feel awkward. If I did I really am sorry. Just remember that you didn’t do anything wrong. I fell hard for you, but you didn’t feel the same way and that is perfectly fine. Once again I am sorry, I just really needed to say this to you. I know that in order for me to be at peace I had to let you know.
 
I hope that your final year goes perfect and I’m sure you’ll get the best grade. It’s clear from having spoken to you that you are extremely smart and articulate. Hopefully The (location) Uni Rugby team also play you in more games. I am positive that you’re one of the best players they have and it’s crazy they don’t play you as regularly as they should. I’m sure they will and you can be the best Open-side Flanker they’ve ever seen. I hope your season also goes really well with (team name) and you win all your games, which I am sure you will.
 
I’ll let you go now. I will never forget you. How could anyone ever forget you? and I very much doubt I will ever get over you. You’re perfect in every way and I really do hope you know that. You deserve someone who can give you everything you could possibly want (and deserve). I wish I could be that person but sometimes things don’t work out and that’s okay. I hope one day, someone makes you feel the same way that I do for you. You truly deserve it and I wish it could’ve been me but I guess it’s not meant to be. 
 
And when you’re back from Uni and ever want to get a coffee or go on a walk, I’d love to see you again, even just for a quick catch up :)

Over the last month I’ve discovered:

- coffee I used to like is rather boring. And bitter.
- I actually am ok with sour coffee
- all the tasting notes aren’t bullshit if you dial in correctly. 
- I still can’t dial in a “fine” robusta


A few questions from those with more experience:

What are your recommendations for robusta?

I’ve also had a few clogs with more finely ground medium roast and light roast beans where brewing time extended to 4-6 minutes and it still tasted great with no bitterness. Is this normal? I use about 88-90 degrees and a mashup of tetsu kasuya and james hoffman recipes. 

I love black coffee but I’m thinking some of the fruity flavors I’m experiencing would go well with milk. Is this sacrilege???

She gave me an ultimatum, either divorce or poly. I don't want a divorce because of kids so it's poly.

It's been few days and I have come to certain conclusions. I want everything separate. She already pays half of everything so it's not a big problem.

I don't want our accounts shared. So I have decided to separate them. I want our bathrooms to be separate, I want our rooms to be separate.

I don't want to do anything that will in any way benefit another man. I want her to buy and cook her own food because I don't want her to gain energy from food I made or bought and use that energy to fuck other men.

I don't want to make coffee for her if it makes her feel better every morning and use that feeling to benefit other men.

I don't even want to talk to her because I may make her feel good and another man benefit from it. I want our communications to beby text.

I don't want to know if she is sick or anything. I don't want to know about anything. I just want her to exist in the home and not take anything from me.

So I took her shit to the separate room and told her my conditions. I also told her that I want separate bank accounts and I am not answerable to her about my money and she can do whatever she wants with her.

Now she doesn't want to leave me alone. Wants to talk about it and figure things out. I am not interested.

I'm in my first year of my PhD, and the general vibe I get within my department and uni is very much to just get the thesis done on time. 
I understand that future scholarship funding for the uni is based on number of completions, so I get that the administration and faculty have the incentive to get everyone to the finish line.


I always imagined that the PhD would involve more of a close knit community of discussing research on the lawn, side quests, and expanding ourselves beyond just our thesis, but it just doesn't seem to be the culture here. I don't really want to drag out the PhD faffing around, so I get the push to finish and get things done on time, but I'd love to experience a more engaged research culture.


A few of us have tried to get our fellow students out of their offices to hang out, yap, and network at the pub or coffee sessions, but it usually ends up being 3 or 4 of the same friends every time. Even the research development team at my uni (who do a phenomenal job at running bootcamps and professional development sessions) have acknowledged that ""fun"" or extracurricular events don't get a lot of interest. 


Does anyone do their PhD in a place that's experimental, community oriented, mind expanding and focused on more than just getting shit done and getting home? I am thinking of spending a few months doing a visiting scholar trip during my PhD and would love to experience the vibes before I go back to the 9-5.


*Note: this is in Australia, so we don't have 2+ years of coursework, it's straight into research.

I didn’t know. It happened so suddenly. I did know that the director who is her manager is a very not so lenient lady based on my experience with her. 

She was here today back at work after being sick and was in a happy mood today. She had been with the company for about two years. I knew a little bit about her life like her two daughters, her husband, her anxiety. We liked alot of the same things. 

Recently, the company has been growing so hiring has spiked sometimes 3-6 people every week and I could tell she was getting burnt out. One day she was stumbling in the office, black eyes, said she downed 2-3 cups of coffee she also had an a hour long commute too. I sympathized because she was even taking calls and texts off business hours. But also on the IT side we don’t have good processes so she had to do alot of waiting and asking. 

Some things did fall through the cracks like not sending out gift bags, she also forgot to schedule I think 3 IT onboardings but I also told my coworker to just schedule it and be proactive she’s busy..

Anyways, we get the email that she’s no longer with us and I just felt sad. *sigh* 

I hope she’s okay and she can atleast finally get some rest.

This world...is rotten.

I truly believe that, at its core, it is rotting like a worm infested apple left out in the open.

Everywhere I turn, in all the places that I care to look, all I can see is a land overrun with crime and violence. 

Abuse, assault, robbery, terrorism—the list just never ends. Day by day they seem to increase with no intention of ever stopping or slowing down...It doesn't help that law enforcement isn't equiped enough to handle the job either.

Don't get me wrong, though. There definitely do exist some competent law enforcers around the world, however, not all of them are at a level where they could deal with these sorts of societal issues as quickly and as efficiently as I do.

That might sound egotistic or borderline narcissistic of me, but I assure you, it is not. I never hesitate to dole out justice whenever evil rears its ugly head.

Not many are cognizant of this fact, but I am L, otherwise known as the world's greatest detective. Even less are aware that I also work as the third and fourth rank detectives—Eraldo Coil and Deneuve—simultaneously after defeating them both in a private exhibition match.

It wasn't a difficult task to achieve considering our gap in skill, however, they weren't much of a challenge either. On that note, throughout my 35 years of life I've only ever faced 2 challenges I've yet to overcome.

One came in the form of the first greatest detective. Yes, that's correct, he is also the first. There is no second.

Unlike me, he lacks an alias and almost never hides his information from the public as well. It wouldn't be a misnomer to label him a celebrity based on that along with the fact that he's currently in a 2 year relationship with Misa Amane; who's accomplished quite a number of things in her simultaneous idol, model and singing careers. They're known as the ""Tower Couple"". 

It was a cutesy play on words of the term ""Power Couple"" but they were really given the title in recognition of their meteoric rise.

At any rate, Light Yagami was a marvelous detective. There's no doubt in my mind he was comparable to me in pure deductive skill. Within a few years he may very have well take the top spot.

Following his addition to the Japanese task force he's managed to solve cases that have stumped them for years while going out of his way on multiple occasions to take those belonging to other countries in his spare time.

During one such occasion, we briefly worked together to locate the source of a disease in Naryn Kyrgyzstan. I wasn't there in person, however I pulled my weight. Despite it being only 1% percent less than he did it still bothers me like it did a year ago. 

I don't like losing. But more than that, I despise being wrong when it comes to exacting justice. It's a fact I've come to acknowledge again after seeing the contents of this case.

I parsed through the pages on my coffee table before stopping at a particular section, carefully raising it to my eye line.

Light Yagami and Misa Amane were found inside their red Chevrolet on May 3rd, Saturday afternoon. Cause of death: Anaphylaxis. Estimated time of death: between 7:19 pm - 7:29 pm the previous day.

To think this is how one of the world's greatest detectives would meet his end.

""How unfortunate. I had rather high hopes for him.""

Following this, 5 other victims made the headlines. All of them were individuals with almost zero media presence.

They all died in the following order:

Ushikawa Waka, Age: 41, Status: Single, Occupation: Homeless, Death: April 15th, Time: 8:40 pm

Kanzaki Ryodo, Age: 30, Status: Single, Occupation: Medical Engineer, Death: April 19th, Time: 8: 25 am

Hanazami Mikata, Age: 15, Status: Single, Occupation: Student, Death: April 24th, Time: 3:42 pm

Kanade Otonokoji, Age: 22, Status: Boyfriend, Occupation: Musician, Death: April 30, Time: 6:40 am

Light Yagami, Age: 28, Status: Engaged, Occupation: Police Detective, Death: May 2nd, Time: 7:19 pm

Misa Amane, Age: 30, Status: Engaged, Occupation: Idol, Model, Singer, Death: May 2nd, 7: 29 pm

Ryoutaro Beppo, Age: 7, Death: May 5, Time: 9:45 am

Such a high number of victims dying so suddenly for a reason contradictory to their medical history means they were either being fed drugs without realizing it or hadn't been aware of their own condition. Both instances are too much of a coincidence to be true.

A person doesn't simply die of anaphylaxis without a severe allergic reaction, neither would they fail to notice pethidine or any other opioid substances mixed in with their food.

Adding the fact that there were no traceable DNA at the scene, them being forcefully overdosed was out of the question seeing as none of the victims' autopsies indicated any signs of struggle prior to their deaths either. Except 1.

Ryoutaro Beppo.

He went missing for a total of 20 days, at the exact start of the killings, and was later found on the side of the road in tattered clothing 10 blocks away from the Yagami household. His home was just around the corner.

The problem right now though isn't only how they were killed, it's why.

Why these people specifically? What reason would the killer have to force a child to his death after a presumed kidnapping?

Pressing a thumb to my lip, I let the page fall to the table.

For one, all deaths occured solely within Japan. Specifically the Kanto region, meaning the killer—which I'll refer to as 'Kira', for now—also resides within that area.

Their killing patterns are irregular judging by both the dates and times of each death, however, the people themselves were deliberate choices. They started off with the least noticeable person they could find then struck again 4 days later with someone more important than the last. They kept this up until the recent triple homicide where their actions have finally become more than just ""passing news"" on the radio.

I'm sure that by the third death Light had already begun investigating these cases. He must've found something the day after the fourth killing, prompting Kira to eliminate him. If not that, then Kira might've just been taking precautions by killing him.

However, considering the time difference between both Light and Misa's deaths, it is possible she'd been interacting with the culprit up until her death. How they went about it, however, is only one way. They hacked the radio.

Their phones weren't active during that period so it is the only explaination that works.

Knowing that, it is highly plausible they did these acts in the spur of the moment and or purely out of a selfish desire to be seen in a particular light by the public. They grew more bold as time passed and whatever shred of empathy they might've had was discarded along with Ryoutaro's body.

At first, Kira may have kidnapped him because they didn't want to kill him, however, they must've come to the conclusion that letting the boy walk free was too risky. With that being the case, either Ryoutaro knew them beforehand or he'd met Kira at the scene of his first crime. The probability was 75% in favor of the second option.

However, the first was still worth looking into.

I called Watari and he quickly entered the room,

""Contact the Japanese task force. Tell them I accept the case and that our culprit is most likely sociopathic.""

""As you wish.""

# Best Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans: 2025 Review

Chocolate covered espresso beans offer an intriguing combination of rich,dark chocolate and the stimulating kick of coffee. These treats have become increasingly popular as a pick-me-up snack, an after-dinner indulgence, or a unique addition to gourmet gift baskets. The market offers a wide variety of brands, bean origins, chocolate types, and flavor infusions, making it challenging for consumers to navigate the selection. This review aims to identify the best chocolate covered espresso beans available in 2025, considering factors like bean quality, chocolate composition, overall taste profile, and value for money. we'll delve into the key features of top contenders, analyze their benefits, compare them with competitors, and provide tailored recommendations for different types of consumers.

## Key Features Analysis

the quality of chocolate covered espresso beans hinges on several critical features.

**Bean Origin and Roast:**

The origin of the espresso beans significantly impacts the final flavor profile.Beans from regions like Ethiopia and Kenya are known for their bright acidity and fruity notes, while Sumatran beans often offer earthy and bold flavors. The roasting process further refines these characteristics, with light roasts preserving more acidity and nuanced flavors, and dark roasts creating a bolder, more intense coffee taste. Beans that have been ethically sourced can offer peace of mind to consumers.

**Chocolate Type and Cacao Percentage:**

The type of chocolate used – whether it's dark, milk, or white – profoundly influences the overall taste experience.Dark chocolate, typically ranging from 55% to 75% cacao or higher, delivers a bittersweet complexity that complements the espresso beans' intensity. Milk chocolate provides a sweeter, creamier contrast, softening the bitterness of the coffee. White chocolate, devoid of cocoa solids, offers a sweet and buttery element. The cacao percentage, specifically in dark chocolate, indicates the proportion of cocoa solids, which directly contributes to the chocolate's richness and intensity.**chocolate-to-Bean Ratio:**

The ratio of chocolate to espresso bean is crucial for achieving a balanced flavor experience. Too little chocolate can result in an overwhelming coffee bitterness, while too much can mask the beans' nuances.An ideal ratio ensures that the chocolate complements the coffee, creating a harmonious blend of flavors and textures.

**Coating and Finish:**

the coating and finish of the chocolate also contribute to the overall sensory experience.A smooth, glossy finish indicates high-quality chocolate and proper tempering. The coating should be even and consistent, without any cracks or imperfections. Some brands offer additional finishes like dusting with cocoa powder or adding a layer of confectioner's glaze for enhanced presentation and texture.

**Ingredient Quality:**

The quality of the ingredients is paramount. Look for espresso beans covered in chocolate that is made from real cocoa butter,not less expensive vegetable oil.Always check for artificial flavors, preservatives, and high fructose corn syrup. Natural ingredients are your best bet to avoid unwanted aftertastes.

**Packaging and Freshness:**

The packaging plays a vital role in maintaining the freshness and quality of the chocolate covered espresso beans. Airtight, resealable packaging helps prevent oxidation and moisture absorption, which can degrade the chocolate's and coffee's flavors over time. Look for packaging that clearly indicates the production or ""best by"" date.## Core Benefits

Chocolate covered espresso beans extend several key benefits to consumers.

**Energy Boost and Focus Enhancement:** The combination of caffeine from the espresso beans and sugar from the chocolate provides a rapid and sustained energy boost. Caffeine acts as a stimulant, improving alertness, focus, and cognitive function. This can be particularly beneficial during periods of low energy, such as mid-afternoon slumps or long study sessions.

**Mood Elevation and Stress Reduction:** Chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, contains compounds like phenylethylamine and serotonin, which are associated with feelings of pleasure and well-being. These compounds can help elevate mood and reduce stress. The combination of chocolate and caffeine can further enhance these effects, providing a temporary mood boost and sense of relaxation.

**Antioxidant Benefits:** Both coffee beans and dark chocolate provide antioxidants, which help protect the body against free radicals. Free radicals can contribute to cellular damage and aging. Antioxidants neutralize these free radicals, promoting overall health and well-being.

**Flavorful and Convenient Indulgence:** Chocolate covered espresso beans offer a flavorful and convenient indulgence that satisfies both chocolate and coffee cravings. These treats are portable and easy to consume, making them a suitable snack for on-the-go enjoyment.

**Guilt-Free Treat:** The combination of a flavorful treat delivered with antioxidants can help consumers enjoy a sweet treat without feeling excessive guilt. Eating a small number of beans per day can deliver caffeine in a portion-controlled manner.

## FAQs Section

**Are chocolate covered espresso beans safe for children?**

No,these are generally not suitable for children. The caffeine content in espresso beans can have adverse effects on children, including increased heart rate, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.It is best to keep chocolate covered espresso beans out of reach of children.

**How should chocolate covered espresso beans be stored?**

Store them in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat. ideally, the temperature should be between 60°F and 70°F (15°C and 21°C).Storing them in the refrigerator is not recommended, as it can cause the chocolate to bloom (develop a white film) and affect its texture and flavor. Be sure to use an airtight container as well.

**What is the average caffeine content per bean?**

The caffeine content can vary depending on the size of the espresso bean and the type of coffee used. On average, one chocolate covered espresso bean contains between six and twelve milligrams of caffeine. This can add up quickly if several beans are consumed. Check the nutritional information on the package to confirm levels for the brand you are using.

**Can chocolate covered espresso beans be vegan?**

Yes, some brands offer vegan options. To ensure the product is vegan, check the ingredient list for any dairy products, such as milk or milk solids, that may be in the chocolate coating. Look for dark chocolate options that are specifically labeled as vegan to avoid any confusion.

You know, when I think about friendship, it’s not the flashy moments that come to mind, it’s the small, almost invisible threads that build a connection over time. Like that friend who remembers your favorite coffee order, or checks in when you’ve been quiet for a while. It’s wild how someone can step into your life unexpectedly and suddenly feel like they’ve been there forever.  

Friendship isn’t measured by years; it’s measured by presence. I’ve had friends I’ve known since childhood who drifted away, and others I met just a few years ago who’ve stuck closer than family. The best ones double your joy when you’re happy and split your pain when you’re low. And honestly? They’re the chocolate chips in the cookie of life, small, sweet, and impossible to imagine living without.  

It’s not about finding a lot of friends, it’s about finding the ones who never let go.

That was it! I was like speechless. So I never replied back. He didn’t sound enthusiastic at all. Like messaging sounded he was sooo forced to do it. 
I think this is the end of our connection. So disappointed! What do you guys think of this? Am I overthinking? Or just leave it as is.",0,1755229343.0,dating_advice,6,0.5,False
1mqmj93,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1mqmj93/too_many_fear_foods/,Too many fear foods,"I am on vacation with my family and am genuinely losing my mind. For context, was diagnosed with osfed earlier this year. I struggle with restrictive eating and extreme anxiety around food as well as an unhealthy relationship with exercise. I am terrified of gaining weight, I have a running calculation in my head of what I’ve eaten and how I can burn it off and I allow myself food only when the calculation allows/when I’ve earned it. 
Anyways. I am on vacation with my family, and the anxiety around what I’ve eaten is genuinely consuming me. We have certain traditions that we do while at the beach, like getting ice cream at different places every night, donuts/bagels in the morning, pizza one night, etc. These are all foods I have labeled as “bad” and having them all in one week has always been scary, for years, but this year with my ED worse than ever, I am genuinely so anxious about it. I can usually cope with one fear food per day, as long as I exercise/restrict to compensate that fear food. But tomorrow I think I will be encountering multiple fear foods. My sister asked me to go to coffee with her in the morning to try this latte, which I’m worried about the calories/sugar. Then my dad will get donuts with breakfast (which I can skip) and then our plan is pizza for dinner and then a specific ice cream place. The pizza, ice cream, and coffee out all in one day is so scary to me, especially after I’ve eaten fear foods all week. I keep obsessing over what to do. I want to be present and engage with my family, but the fear is so intense that I want to skip out on most of these activities. 
I guess im just asking for some advice/encouragement/similar stories. Thank you guys :)",4,1755229322.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

I have a pretty massive collection of postcards, stationery, stickers etc. so rest assured, my letters will be fire.

\- My favorite color is green, I wore it so much as a kid I was convinced I was actually the green Power Ranger (alas, I am not)

\- I'm a barista (yes I love coffee) and getting back into my habit of reading too so any recommendations would be lovely :)

\- Hobbies include handlettering/calligraphy, painting, gaming, reading, anything artsy fartsy really, currently working on my embroidering skill before I move onto my crochet project

\- Music: Okay to be honest I'm a little all over the place here, my top three favorite artists are Lana Del Rey, Ghostemane, and GRLwood. I also loveeeeee Ramin Djawadi, iykyk.

\- I tried to keep the info about me pretty basic, didn't wanna give too much away, just enough to get a vibe from me hopefully. Lastly, I did want to add that I love deeper and meaningful conversations, anything from philosophy, morals, politics, etc. I love learning and being able to hold respectful discussions with people, that's just how we grow.

I look forward to making a few friends on here! Feel free to DM or comment on here if you're interested :)",2,1755229322.0,penpals,2,1.0,False

Maybe you can share your experience too?","I used to think I was invincible. I was thirty, living in Texas, working as a programmer, and treating my body like an afterthought. All nighters on caffeine, drinking until sunrise, chain smoking whenever stress hit, doomscrolling until my eyes burned. If I could still show up to work, I figured I was fine.

Then came my company’s annual health check. I almost skipped it. But the report smacked me in the face: early stage chronic gastritis with erosions in my stomach lining. Not cancer. Not deadly… yet. The doctor warned me that if I kept living like this, it could turn into something much worse.

At first, I brushed it off. Then the symptoms started: constant bloating, sharp stomach pains after heavy meals. I even got nauseous during the meetings. The worst was lying awake at 3 am, clutching my stomach, hating myself for ignoring the warning signs.

One random night, I was scrolling through my phone and came across a line from Papillon: “Your greatest sin is wasting your life.” I thought, If I died tomorrow, my legacy would be hangovers, a shelf of unread books, and a worn out laptop. That thought broke me.

I quit smoking overnight. Cut alcohol to maybe once a month. Set a strict bedtime, and keep my eyes shut, even when my mind refuses to rest. Started eating lighter, earlier dinners. I put screen limits on my phone and swapped late night scrolling for reading and listening to podcasts. The first week was hell. My body screamed for the old habits. But after a month, my mornings didn’t feel like a punishment anymore.
Reading became my anchor. Not just for distraction, but for rewiring my brain. Books gave me frameworks for discipline, self awareness, and long term thinking. A few standouts:
Atomic Habits by James Clear, this book ruined all my excuses. Clear makes behavior change feel not just simple but inevitable, with practical ways to break bad habits and replace them with small, consistent wins. I kept it on my desk like a manual. 

What I do is to pair that with The Untethered Soul by Michael A. Singer, which cracked open the realization that so much of my mental suffering was self created. If you’ve ever felt trapped in your own head, his writing feels like someone opening a window to let fresh air in. 
And then, Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker is just like a wakeup call for me. Realizing how much sleep fuels my health and mind turned me into a near saint about protecting my bedtime. Together, these books shifted how I live, my habits, my inner world, and even the way I rest.
When I felt too mentally drained for full books, I found a hack that kept me learning without frying my brain: BeFreed. A friend introduced me, it’s a smart reading and book summary app built by a team from Columbia University. Perfect for when you’re working full time & barely have energy left. It turns dense nonfiction into podcast style episodes in different lengths: 10 min quick hits, 20 min recaps, or 40 min deep dives. I even customized my podcast host to be a non judgemental, chill best friend. It feels like we are catching up over coffee. The AI actually learns about your life, struggles, and goals, like my adult ADHD and the demands of my job, and builds a personalized learning roadmap that adapts over time. Now I’ve knocked out books I’d been “meaning to read” for years, The Selfish Gene,Cosmos, Poor Charlie’s Almanack. It’s the only thing that’s made reading as addictive as doomscrolling.

I also leaned on other free, high value resources. The Ten Percent Happier Podcast gave me practical, mindfulness based tools for stress, sleep, and focus that I could apply immediately. The YouTube channel Better Ideas kept me inspired with short, cinematic takes on self discipline and meaning. Together, these turned my downtime into actual fuel for growth instead of a black hole.

Now my life is unrecognizable. I wake up earlier without hating it. I take morning walks. I cook for myself more than I order in. Nights out are about connection, not numbing myself. I’ve been to Burningman, the Grand Canyon, Georgia coast, places I always said I’d go “someday.” I even started horseback riding and golf just to prove to myself I can still learn new skills.

The health checks still make me nervous, but they also remind me how far I’ve come. They’re no longer about waiting for bad news, they’re proof I’m investing in myself. If I could go back, I’d start sooner. You don’t need a life threatening diagnosis to change your life. You just need to pay attention before your body forces you to.",4,1755229156.0,AskMenAdvice,3,1.0,False

I started taking medication for ADHD for the first time this year. I was prescribed dexamfetamine and told to start on 5mg twice a day and then go up to 10mg twice a day (so total 20mg) if it was not working after a week. I had a boost in energy and mild side effects the first few days after I started and after I upped to 10mg however since then have felt as if I am just taking sugar pills. I have zero benefits or side effects, and the only way I can even tell I've taken them is that if I drink coffee afterwards I get a buzz, which I never used to get from caffeine. However other than that I would not be able to tell if I was taking them or not.

I told my psychiatrist this and he switched me to Ritalin. He wrote me a prescription for 10mg four times a day and told me to start with 1 10mg a day and slowly up the dose to a max of 40mg a day.

I'm just wondering if anyone can give me insight into why he would have switched drugs instead of upping the dosage for dexamfetamine? Since I was having zero side effects on it. My understanding of stimulant prescribing is that you are supposed to start low and slowly increase the dosage until the required effect is achieved or the side effects are intolerable? I googled and the max dexamfetamine prescribers in my state can prescribe daily is 50mg, so at 20mg a day I'm well below the max.

If it is relevant at all, I have benign bradycardia (resting HR around 50) so I'm fairly sure stimulant effects on the heart aren't an issue?

## key Features Analysis

The best mirrored coffee tables of 2025 boast a combination of high-quality materials, innovative design, and practical functionality.

**Mirror Quality and Clarity:** The quality of the mirror itself is paramount. Look for tables crafted with high-definition (HD) mirror glass that provides a crystal-clear reflection without distortion. The best mirrors use silver nitrate as a reflective layer, which offers superior durability and resistance to tarnishing compared to aluminum-backed mirrors.The thickness of the mirror also contributes to its longevity and resistance to cracking or chipping.

**Frame Construction and Materials:** The frame supporting the mirrored surfaces can be constructed from various materials, each offering distinct advantages. Solid wood frames,such as oak or maple,provide exceptional stability and a classic aesthetic.Metal frames, especially those made from stainless steel or wrought iron, offer a contemporary look and are resistant to rust and corrosion. Engineered wood, such as MDF, can provide a cost-effective alternative while still offering adequate support.The quality of the frame's construction is crucial for ensuring the table's stability and longevity.

**Design and Style Aesthetics:** Mirrored coffee tables are available in a wide range of design styles to suit diverse aesthetic preferences. Modern designs often feature clean lines, geometric shapes, and minimalist detailing. Art deco styles incorporate intricate patterns, luxurious materials, and a touch of extravagance. Vintage-inspired designs may include ornate carvings, antique finishes, and a sense of timeless elegance. Selecting a design that complements your existing décor and personal style is essential for creating a cohesive and harmonious living space.

**Size and Dimensions:** Consider the size and dimensions of your living room when choosing a mirrored coffee table. A large table can visually dominate a small space, while a small table may get lost in a larger room. Measure the available space carefully and consider the table's height in relation to your sofa and seating arrangement.A table that is approximately the same height as your sofa cushions is generally considered to be the moast comfortable and functional option.

**Storage and Functionality:** Some mirrored coffee tables offer additional storage options, such as drawers, shelves, or lift-top mechanisms.These features can be particularly useful in smaller living spaces where storage is limited. Drawers can provide a discreet place to store remote controls, magazines, or other small items. Shelves can be used to display decorative objects or books.Lift-top mechanisms can transform the coffee table into a temporary workspace or dining surface.

## Core Benefits

The advantages of incorporating a mirrored coffee table into your home extend beyond mere aesthetics.

**Enhanced Lighting and Spaciousness:** Mirrored surfaces reflect light, which can brighten up a room and create the illusion of more space. This is particularly beneficial in smaller living rooms or rooms with limited natural light. By reflecting existing light sources, a mirrored coffee table can make a room feel more open, airy, and inviting.

**Elevated Décor and Style:** A mirrored coffee table can instantly elevate the décor of any living space,adding a touch of glamour and sophistication. The reflective surface creates a focal point that draws the eye and adds visual interest. Whether you prefer a sleek modern design or an ornate vintage style,a mirrored coffee table can enhance the overall aesthetic of your room and reflect your personal style.

**Versatility and Adaptability:** Mirrored coffee tables are surprisingly versatile and can complement a wide range of décor styles. They work well with both contemporary and traditional furnishings, adding a touch of elegance to any setting.

## FAQs Section

**Are mirrored coffee tables safe for households with children?**
While mirrored coffee tables are generally safe, it’s important to consider the edge design. Look for tables with rounded or beveled edges to minimize the risk of injury. Tempered glass is also a safer option as it shatters into small, less sharp pieces. Parental supervision is always recommended, especially with young children.

**How do I prevent fingerprints and smudges on the mirrored surface?**
Regular cleaning with a microfiber cloth and glass cleaner is the best way to prevent fingerprints and smudges.Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the mirrored surface.Consider using a furniture polish specifically designed for mirrored surfaces to provide a protective layer and reduce the appearance of fingerprints.

**Can mirrored coffee tables scratch easily?**
Mirrored surfaces can be susceptible to scratches, especially if exposed to rough objects or abrasive cleaners. To prevent scratches, avoid placing sharp objects directly on the table's surface. Use coasters or placemats to protect the mirror from spills and scratches.Lift objects rather of dragging them across the surface.

My friend and I recently visited Newfoundland (July 25th-29th) and we had an amazing time! It was a relaxing trip and we were able to do everything we wanted to do with little to no issues.

About us: I'm a Canadian born and raised in Ontario who wanted to explore other parts of Canada. My friend is a Californian who wanted to come see me but since she's already been to Ontario we decided to explore a new place instead. We're not big hikers or campers, so we avoided any strenuous hikes. We're both artists, and carried our paints around. We don't drink, so we avoided any bars/breweries. We're homebodies, so we spent our evenings in the airbnb watching movies.

Rental details:

* We got our airbnb in a neighbourhood near Conception Bay.
* We used Turo to rent a car. A week before our arrival, the Turo user cancelled on us. We easily found a new Turo (that was $100 cheaper than the first, so blessing in disguise).

I will post all expenses at the end of the trip report, but in total (flights, airbnb, etc), I spent \~$1300 CAD and she spent \~$1300 USD (her flight was more expensive than mine).

Itinerary:

Fri July 25th:

* Arrive at airport 1PM.
* Tim Hortons break and friend catch up conversation until 2PM
* Taxi to car location (it was more expensive to get the Turo to come to the airport than it was to taxi to the location of the car)
* Drive to Airbnb, check out airbnb
* Explore St. Johns:
   * Duckworth street
   * Jelly bean row
   * Water street
   * (More downtown explore, pics, cafes, souvenier shops, etc)
   * The Battery (base of Signal Hill for pics)
   * We tried to do the 1 hour Signal Hill hike, but couldn't find the one we saw online? We did a mini hike up to a little viewpoint (which I think was The Battery?) but I'm notoriously bad at navigating trail maps so...
   * Drove up to Signal Hill, took pics
   * Supper (Ches's fish and chips)
   * Conception Bay after sunset (we wanted to see the sunset but it was a very cloudy day so there was no sunset view), relax by the water and eat Coffee Crisp (her first time eating it! She loved it)
   * Back to airbnb for movie and sleep

Sat July 26th:

* Wake up, breakfast (we bought bagels and butter from the supermarket)
* Drive to O'brien's whale tours at 9AM (2 hours)
* Do the whale tours 
   * We didn't see any whales, but they were kind enough to show us fishing! The fish were lovely and sparkly
   * The puffins were adorable and it was amazing seeing the bird colonies
* Explore a bit of the area 
   * Bay Bulls, Tors Cove, Irish Loop Coffee House
   * Saw a whale tail here and a whale back there etc. but never a full whale lol
   * The Tolt (this was a viewing point next to a graveyard. We painted here, it was lovely!)
* Quidi Vidi Village 
   * Cute but we didn't care for the brewery and aside from cute houses didn't find any other reason to be here
* Bought some dinners from the supermarket, back to airbnb, movies and early sleep

Sun July 27th:

* Early rise for the sunrise, drive to Cape Spear lighthouse and arrive for \~5:00AM
* We were there until almost 7:30AM just walking, talking, painting, eating bagels and drinking tea we bought, and enjoying the atmosphere. One of my favourite parts of the trip
* Begin Irish loop:
   * Witless Bay, Burnt Cove, Ferryland Lighthouse, Cape Race, Miniature Fishermen (note: the installation has since been removed), Trepassy, Saint Vincent's Beach 
   * Again, we only saw a part of a whale here and there. We did see many seals though! They stick their heads out of the water and look around like they're trying to find each other, it's so cute.
   * The Atlantic ocean is huge and beautiful, but I didn't expect it to be scary and intimidating too. A lot of these beaches looked like liminal spaces, it was gorgeous and awe-inspiring
   * Ate at Edge of the Avalon Inn and had the best seafood cod chowder I'd ever had, at a reasonable price
   * Drove back after Saint Vincent's beach, ate dinner, and passed out
   * Note (especially to all the recommendations I got that this was too much driving): it was a VERY manageable amount of driving (I almost want to say too easy except for the fact that we didn't wear sunscreen so got a little sunburned by the windshield), and we completed the loop by 5PM, and that was with tons of stops and rests.

Sun July 28th:

* Slower morning, breakfast
* Drive to Dildo, giggle and explore
   * Very small and quaint town! We loved the cafe there, Dildo Coffee House. Amazing grilled cheese!
* Explore:
   * Bay Roberts, Spectacle Head, Cupids, Green Point Lighthouse (second favourite part of the whole trip, and one of my favourite paintings), Brigus
* Drive home, clean airbnb, clean car, pack

Mon July 29th:

* Early morning flights (7AM)
* Dropped Turo off at location at 5:30AM, booked a taxi to take us to the airport. It was smooth and easy.

If you'd like to see the paintings (at least that I did), I've posted them [here ](https://www.tumblr.com/dailycupofcreativitea/791065947784036352?source=share)(the rest of it is DBZ art so don't mind that...).

Cost breakdown (all in CAD):

* My flight from Toronto (idk her flight): $429.32 (yes I know it's a lot, but I got this last minute with Expedia. Porter and Air Canada combination. Only 1 carry on allowed but it sufficed).
* Airbnb: $704.19
* Car: $669.70
* Whale tour (for two people with tax): $207
* Misc spending (groceries, parking, convenience): $26.97
* Walmart: $20.88
* Gas 1: $50
* Gas 2: $25
* Uber: $29.31
* Taxi: $31
* Dinner (chowder): $52.9

Total (without small things like buying Tims or lunch for ourselves, and without flights): $1816.95

Also, weather:

* Alternated between warm enough to wear a sunhat + my dress without pants + sweating a little (so about 25 with strong sunshine) to 12 degrees and needing my wind breaker fleece jacket. A spring jacket would suffice in those temperatures. I felt the need for fingerless gloves at sunrise. 

Overall, it was an amazing trip, and 10000/10 I would do it again! Maybe icebergs, more whales, more hiking, etc. Definitely I want to see more birds (like Cape St. Mary's Ecological Reserve) and also Bonavista. Next time, next time. :)",1,1755228069.0,canadatravel,0,1.0,False

The play? Simple. Keep the ER flat, maybe even grim. Guide low. Miss on a line item or two. Don’t spike the ball. Let the stock take a “surprise” hit.

While retail panics and stops get triggered, the tutes step in quietly, mopping up shares at clearance prices. No headlines. No frenzy. Just quiet accumulation under the cover of “market disappointment.”

1mqm0uw,https://jaxhumor.com/blogs/learn-about-jacksonville/best-dog-parks-jacksonville-fl,"Best Dog Parks in Jacksonville, FL","Jacksonville sprawls across **840 square miles**, the largest city by land area in the contiguous U.S., which means your dog’s perfect park day might be five minutes away… or across the river.

# Planning Your Dog Park Day (Step-by-Step)

# Step 1: Health, Safety & Paperwork

*  **Vaccinations:** Rabies + core vaccines current; save photos to your phone. 
*  **ID & Microchip:** Collar tag with your number; microchip info up to date. 
*  **Flea/Tick/Heartworm:** Year-round prevention in Florida is non-negotiable. 
*  **Heat Awareness:** If the **heat index is 95+**, choose indoor/covered options (e.g., Kanine Social) or go early/late. 

# Step 2: Pack Smart

* **Water + collapsible bowl** 
*  **Leashes:** 4–6 ft standard + spare; avoid long retractables in crowded areas. 
* **Waste bags (extra)** 
*  **High-value treats** for recall and calm refocus 
*  **Towel/wipes** for rain, mud, or beach salt 
*  **First-aid basics:** styptic powder, saline, gauze, tick remover 
*  **Shade hack:** lightweight sun umbrella for fence line (if allowed) 

# Step 3: Time It Right

*  **Summer:** Before 9 a.m. or after 6:30 p.m. 
*  **Shoulder seasons:** Late afternoon is perfect. 
*  **After rain:** Expect puddles, slick turf, and excited play; monitor closely. 

# Step 4: On-Site Etiquette (Keep It Safe & Fun)

*  **Gate dance:** Slip lead off only *after* the inner gate is closed. 
*  **2-minute rule:** New dogs? Watch first 120 seconds closely, adjust if play escalates. 
*  **Body language:** Curved approaches = good; stiff posture/locked stare = pause and redirect. 
*  **Breaks:** Call your dog away every 5–10 minutes for a reset and water. 
*  **No food bowls or toys** in crowded yards (resource guarding risk). 
*  **Leash back up** at first sign of fatigue, over-arousal, or fixation. 

# Step 5: Florida Wildlife & Water Notes

*  **Ponds/Lakes:** Avoid stagnant water and visible algae blooms (blue-green algae can be toxic). 
*  **Wildlife:** This is Florida, assume **snakes** and **gators** near natural water. Stick to posted areas and keep dogs out of vegetated shorelines. 
*  **Salt & Sand:** Rinse after beach days to prevent skin irritation and paw abrasion. 

 

# Dog-Friendly Beaches & Trails (Bonus)

*  **Beaches:** Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, and Atlantic Beach have **leash rules and time-of-day restrictions** that change occasionally. Always check the latest city rules before you go, keep dogs leashed, and pack extra bags. 
*  **Shaded Trails:** For leashed nature walks, look for **regional parks with oak canopy** and boardwalks; early mornings are your friend. 

# Quick Park Comparison (At a Glance)

**Biggest Off-Leash Space:** Dog Wood Park  
**Best Rain/Heat Plan:** Kanine Social (indoor)  
**Best Beach Vibes:** BrewHound (post-ocean hang)  
**Best Budget Pick:** Ed Austin Regional Dog Park  
**Best for Jax Beach Locals:** Paws Park at Wingate Park  
**Best Central-City Stop:** John Gorrie Dog Park (Riverside)  
**Best Beyond City Limits:** Poochie’s Park (Orange Park)

 

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need vaccine records?**  
 Yes for private/membership parks (often checked at entry). For public parks, it’s still smart to carry proof.

**Are intact dogs allowed?**  
 Rules vary; many private parks require non-aggressive behavior regardless of spay/neuter status. If in doubt, ask ahead.

**What if my dog is shy?**  
 Go at **off-peak hours**, start in the small-dog/low-energy area, and keep sessions short with frequent breaks.

**How hot is too hot?**  
 If you can’t keep your hand on the pavement for **7 seconds**, it’s too hot for paws. Choose grass, go early/late, or pick an indoor option.

**Can I bring kids?**  
 Some parks allow it with supervision; others discourage it. Read posted rules, safety first.

 

# Prep Checklist (Copy/Paste)

* Time your visit (early/late in summer) 
* Quick weather + algae/wildlife scan 

**At the Park**

* Breaks every 5–10 minutes; water often 
* No food bowls/toys in crowded yards

She’d push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn’t come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was “too messy.”

Every time I opened up, she'd say: “If you don’t like it, I’ll just leave.”

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.(After the end)

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom’s birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would… and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn’t let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn’t going to a party  so I said I’d go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside… her sister saw me and brought me in. She introduced me to her friends as her boyfriend. Later that night, she randomly said: “Should we download an app and find you a hot girl?”


One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn’t even check on me. Just said: “I won’t text you unless you text me first.”

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should “just be friends.” But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn’t want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddled… then talked about breaking up minutes later.(A matter of hours)

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I “sent her to a mental clinic.” Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom’s birthday  I didn’t go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

To this day… I don’t know what I did so wrong. My feelings for her were real.",2,1755227586.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.75,False

We’re living in the beta release era for automating, well, *everything*, and it feels a little bit like picking up cheat codes IRL.

Here are just a few reasons why I’m legit excited about the rise of AI automation:

- **Tasks that used to take hours now take seconds.** Do your weekly reports autopopulate into that beautifully formatted PDF? Check! Does your inbox filter itself into gorgeous colored folders? Double check.
- **Creativity is democratized.** Don’t have time to make assets for your pitch? No problem, generative AI is happy to be your assistant designer, copyright lawyer, and presentation whiz while you go grab coffee.
- **Empowerment for the “non-techie” folks.** I love seeing my less code-oriented friends solve big problems with a single Zap or GPT plugin. The look on their faces when it ""just works"" is honestly priceless.

But here's where it gets *even cooler.* The AI we use for automation is not just copying scripts—it’s starting to learn *intentions*. Hello, smart workflows! Imagine scheduling a meeting and having the AI not only find the best slot, but also book the room, prep your slides, and draft a follow-up agenda before you hit send.

Every time I think, “AI can’t possibly automate that,” someone out there proves me wrong. Whether it’s bringing hyper-efficiency to home life (ahem, smart grocery lists that update themselves?) or letting teams do in weeks what used to take a year of grind, the possibilities are just exploding.

What genuinely gets me out of bed in the morning is this sense that mundane tasks are finally being handed off, so we can ALL lean into what we do best:

- Dream up new ideas
- Solve gnarly human problems
- Build, create, connect, and share

Of course, there are challenges (and yes, lots of passionate debate!), but the vibe I’m getting is overwhelmingly positive. With a focus on responsible, creative automation, we're not just making life a little easier—we’re opening the door for WAY more people to join the party and make cool things.

Even two houses with an identical floor plan will eventually gain their own unique details, like twins. These quirks of the home become just another part of the day- the light that only turns on when you hit the wall just right, the shower that freezes your bones with one unfortunate toilet flush- you get it. At worst, these quirks may be annoying, sometimes costly to fix, but other times, some would argue they build character. So what if I told you a home could get a malignant quirk? Sounds ridiculous, right? I thought so too. But with what I’ve encountered these past few months, and the body on my shower floor right now, I’d be ignorant to say that my house doesn’t have something deeply wrong with it. Let me explain.



My wife Linda and I were tired of renting apartments. We were potentially wanting to start a family. So after a few years of saving, it was time to look for that dream home of ours. We loaded up into the sedan, ready to visit a few houses that caught our eye, when my wife uttered the worst sentence I could imagine: “You ready to drive over to my mother's?”



Okay, listen to me. I know it’s cliché to hate your mother-in-law. I get it. Here’s the thing: I don’t care. I hate Ruth. The less I talk about her, the lower my blood pressure gets. Unfortunately, she’s a really good Realtor, so it only makes sense to go with her to help secure a house. It really doesn’t help when you live in a small city either- there’s not a lot of options, y’know? I still wasn’t happy with the choice. She sticks her nose into all of our business and absolutely hates everything about me. She once tried to get my wife to break up with me for a random cashier. *Seven years into our relationship.* That woman’s never seen a day beyond misery, but my wife insists that she remains in our lives, and because I love my wife, I hold my tongue. I only wish Ruth would hold hers.



So, we pulled up to Ruth’s house, and of course, she’s wearing her finest scowl, which only deepens when she makes eye contact with me. She took her time to enter the backseat.



My wife beamed at her, trying to lighten the mood. “Hey, mom! We have about three houses we wanted to look at. Is that still the plan for today?”



Ruth nodded approvingly. “Yes, dear. I want to make sure you don’t choose a house in some run-down neighborhood. You can never be too careful these days- they’ll sell you a house with a painted tarp for a roof.”



“Ruth.” I cleared my throat and acknowledged her presence. Her demeanor shifted immediately.



“Samuel.”



“You’re radiant today.”



“You’re late.”



My wife’s hand on my leg told me I couldn’t fire back with whatever I was going to say, so I didn’t, and instead made the decision to get the car in gear over to the first house. We pulled up to a 3-bed, 2-bathroom home, with a freshly maintained lawn and a new coat of dazzling white paint. Touring the place, it seemed fine enough, until Ruth explained there were 8 offers on the house already. ‘It’s practically already sold, ’ were her words. The second place was technically a steal for the price, even though it was a little bit of a fixer-upper, though Ruth just *had* to chime in.



“It’s too much work for Samuel. You’re gonna be swimming in half-finished projects, in a half-finished house.” She scoffed, placing herself in the back seat.



“I don’t think it’s unsalvageable, Ruth. With a little bit of time, I could probably-”



“You said the same thing about painting your living room. That took you, what, several months?”



My hands instinctively went to pinch between my eyes. “We had to get permission from our landlord. On top of that,  *I broke my leg.”*



She threw her hands up, focusing on my wife. “All I’m saying is that if he couldn’t paint some walls, I don’t have high hopes for that one.” Whether she was referring to the home or me, I couldn’t tell.

The last house was a further drive from the rest. As the suburb gave way to nature, Ruth filled us in.

“I’m not so sure about this one, but I know Linda’s tastes. The owner seems very old-school; he says he wants to be a part of the whole process. He’ll be giving us a tour of the house.” She squinted through her glasses to look at her notes. “Clearly there must be something wrong with it- it’s way under market.”



Eventually, we found ourselves at the house, nestled snug in a blanket of trees. Though simple in design, looking at the weather vane on the roof and the rocking chair on the porch, my wife and I could tell this home had character. We were admiring the outside knick-knacks when an older gentleman stepped out from the front door. His appearance reminded me of an old sheriff character straight from a western- his mustache wiggled as he spoke.



“You hear to take a look around?” His voice carried a roughness tempered by experience.



“Yes, sir. You the owner?” I held my hand out to shake his.



He nodded, and reciprocated. “Yessir. Been the owner for about 25 years, give or take.”



He invited the three of us into a home that clearly was once cozy. Two gaudy recliners sat in front of an old CRT TV in a conversation pit. A deer’s head was mounted above the fireplace, staring vacantly across the room. A shag rug dominated most of the living room territory. No one had informed this household that the 1970s were over. From the looks of it, no one had cleaned since the 70s either: A thick layer of dust coated just about everything. Normally, most people would take one look at a place like this in disgust and turn on their heel out the door. My wife and I, however, had weird tastes. By the glimmer in my wife’s eyes, I could tell she loved the aesthetic just as much as I did. Ruth was too busy sneering at a family of ceramic ducks on a shelf to voice her distaste. We were all jostled to life by the owner when he cleared his throat.



“Kitchen’s this way. Hope you like yellow.”



Well, to simply say the kitchen was yellow would be like describing Godzilla as ‘a pretty big lizard’. Wood cabinets, yellow countertops, and floral tile- this house could’ve been a set for a sitcom just switching over to color TV. Despite its age, however, and the apparent lack of cleanliness, what surprised us was how well *maintained* it appeared. Not a door hinge out of place, not a speck of rust. My wife inspected each angle of every piece of furniture, a basset hound searching for something amiss.



“I love the aesthetic in here. It’s a beautiful home.” She cooed, running a hand along the fridge.



“You can thank my wife for it. She refused to change a thing about this house, and, well… I just couldn’t either when...” His sentence died out as the man stared out the window just above the sink, into the woods.



It’s a little awkward to console a person you know nothing about, but I tried my hand at it anyway.



“I’m sorry about your loss.”



He simply shrugged. “Bound to happen eventually. Just wish it would’ve been me, not her.”



I wasn’t sure what to say to that, and for once, I was glad to see Ruth as she stepped into the kitchen. She stifled a gag. “Ugh. Horrendous.”



With each room we saw, my wife and I fell further in love with the home. Both bedrooms and the backyard carried the same energy as the rest of the place- a vignette of better days, waiting for another chance to be filled with happiness. Towards the end, however, the man presented the oddities of the house that, at the time, I looked over. How was I supposed to know I was staring a nightmare in the face that I didn’t even see?



“House only got one shower.” He swung open the guest bathroom, revealing simply a toilet, sink, and cabinet. I mistook the fear in his voice for reluctance to admit a flaw in the house.



“That’s not necessarily a deal breaker for us, right, Sam?” My wife didn’t seem phased either.



I shook my head. “Nah, I don’t think that’s a problem. We’ll manage.”



The owner looked at me solemnly. “I hope you do. C’mon, let me show you what you’d be working with.” He stiffly moved his way toward the main bathroom, leading us down the hall. He opened the door and motioned for us to take a look inside.



Red.



Each wall and floor tile was a deep, reddish-orange hue. The sink cabinets, toilet, and shower (with tub) were pea green. I’d been vibing with the retro look up to this point, but something about this bathroom didn’t feel great. Linda and I stared at the vibrant mess of the room before exchanging a glance at each other. Our eyebrows communicated what we were thinking: *Remodel.* We turned to face the owner, who made no attempt to step a single inch into the door frame. He had a thousand-yard stare, keeping his eyes on the shower at all times.



“So, how many offers?” I asked, snapping the man out of a daze.



“None yet.” He scratched his stark white mustache, and the wrinkles on his forehead multiplied with the furrowing of his brow in thought.



On cue, Ruth spoke up. “You’re not serious-”



“Mom, please.” Linda stuck her hand out to shush Ruth. I couldn’t help but smile.



That afternoon, we sat at his dining table and worked out our offer. The man seemed more than pleased with what he was getting, which worked for me, as I was willing to go a lot higher for what he was offering; he was planning on leaving the place fully furnished. ‘They won’t let me take it to assisted living,’ was his explanation. The rest of the process was quick. With all inspections passed with flying colors, we had all the papers signed and sealed by the end of the week, ready to move in that weekend.



That Saturday, we rented a mini trailer for all the stuff we wanted to keep, and left what we didn’t want, as a ‘pay it forward’ to the next tenant. Our excitement was contagious on the drive away from our apartment complex, despite knowing we were on our way to Ruth’s house to pick up the keys. In true Ruth fashion, when she handed us the keys, she didn’t decide on a “Congratulations” or an “Enjoy your new home”, instead opting to give us one last piece of her mind. “I think you could’ve done better.”



“Sure, Ruth.” I nodded, taking the keys from her. “Linda will text you when we get there!” We peeled out of her driveway, smiling and waving as her grimace trailed out of sight. Next stop: home sweet home.



It was near dusk by the time we reached our isolated new digs, the last rays of sun stretching frantically above the forest as they sank below the treeline. We stood at the threshold of the front door and unlocked it for the first time.



“Welcome home, Sam.”



“Welcome home, Linda.”



We began moving boxes inside, filling up the closet with things to sort through the next day. Passing by the kitchen, I spotted a piece of paper out of place, taped to the countertop. I picked up the note and read it, unaware just how much my life would change from that moment on. It read:



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~



Rules for ‘The Thrumming.’



Hello Sam and Linda. You seem like good people, but I couldn’t wait much longer, so I had to go with whoever showed up first. I’m sorry. I hope you’ll forgive me. It was nothing personal.



There’s something wrong with this house. Something lives here. Marie, my wife, called it ‘The Thrumming’ because of the noise it makes. It came with the house all those years ago, and it’s been around for a long, long time. I’m going to give you the same rules I was given, in hopes it keeps you safe. Under no circumstances should you break these rules. I’ve seen what happens. Martha made one little slip-up, one mistake in old age, and now it’s just me. I’m getting old. Getting tired. Couldn’t do it anymore. Maybe you’ll be the one to find a way to stop this thing.



Rule 1: From ten seconds after the shower is turned on until ten seconds after the shower is turned off, ***do not open your eyes.*** You need to keep your eyes closed, so you don’t see it. You’ll know when it’s watching you.



Rule 2: When showering, only one person should be in the bathroom. More people means more chances of someone breaking the rules.



Rule 3: When showering, keep the bathroom door locked, so no one accidentally walks in and sees it.



Rule 4: ***Ignore what it says to you.*** It will only get better at tempting you to open your eyes. Don’t.





\~\~\~\~\~\~\~





I reread the message twice. *What a weird, sick joke. I never took the old guy to be the type,* I thought. I heard Linda come up behind me with a bag of groceries. “What’s that? Did he leave us a housewarming message?” The curiosity was clear in her voice.



“Yes. Very sweet. Hannibal Lecter would be tickled pink.” I handed her the note and watched her face shift into a myriad of expressions, landing on confusion.



“What?” She handed me back the note.



I shrugged. “Weird old guy. I feel sorry for him.” I tucked the note into my pocket, and we continued to unpack our car. We didn’t dwell too much on the strange note. It wasn’t until Linda went to bed, and I went to take a shower, that I thought of it again. Standing on the blood-orange colored tiles, staring at the shower, I hesitated, only to immediately be embarrassed by my hesitation.



“Poor guy was just confused.” I tried to reassure myself. My hands fumbled with the shower knob, turning it on. I couldn’t help but count.



One Mississippi.



Two Mississippi.



Three Mississippi.



The water warmed up just enough for me to step inside.



Four Mississippi.



Five Mississippi.



Six Mississippi.



I looked around the room. It was a normal room. *Nothing’s going to happen,* I thought to myself.



Seven Mississippi.



Eight Mississippi.



I admit, I closed my eyes. I just felt like I had to. I’m so glad I did.



Nine Mississippi.



Ten-



Something shifted in the light of my closed eyelid, and then I heard it. Immediately, I understood why they called it The Thrumming.



Let me do my best to describe what I heard. First, close your eyes. While your eyes are closed, clench your inner ear muscles. It should sound like a constant, vibrating, pulsing hum in your head. Like far-off thunder, nestled in your brain. That’s what The Thrumming sounds like. I was so startled by the noise, I almost threw my eyes open. I don’t know how I didn’t. I had no idea what to do- I could feel something standing right outside of the shower. It was big- I could tell a lot of light was being blocked. I could feel it heaving, a cold gust breaking through the warmth of the shower in a rhythmic breathing motion. I scrambled to turn off the shower, and I counted again. At ten Mississippi, the rumbling stopped, the breathing stopped, and the shape blocking the light in my closed eyes was no longer there. I waited another ten seconds to be safe before opening my eyes.



Nothing. No footprints, no sign of the door ever being unlocked. The room looked exactly as it did when I entered it. I sprinted to my sleeping wife, not even bothering to grab a towel, and woke her up.



“Linda- get up, we gotta go.” I hissed, shaking her.



She shot up, grumbling, wiping the sleep from her eyes. “What? Sam, what are you-” She glanced at my state of dress. “...what’s going on?”



“That creepy note about the shower? Yeah. It’s real. We need to go.” I haphazardly threw a shirt on backwards as I hopped on one foot into a pair of jeans.



“Very funny, Sam. Can I go back to sleep?” She yawned, resting her head back on the pillow.



I shook her awake again, sitting her up in the bed. “I’m telling you, it’s real. C’mon, I’ll prove it.” She followed me to the door of the bathroom, grumbling the entire time. “Okay, go in there, turn the shower on, and close your eyes. Don’t open them.” I reiterate.



“Once I do this, *then* can I go to sleep?” She stretched.



“You won’t want to. Remember, keep your eyes closed. Ten seconds after the shower’s on, to ten seconds after the shower’s off.” I closed the door immediately when she entered the bathroom. I heard the water turn on. Nearly ten seconds of water running, I heard one of Linda’s yawns pitch into a squeak of surprise. Nearly immediately, the water turned off. About fifteen seconds later, there was a scramble of footsteps, before she threw open the door, pale as a ghost.



“What was that?!” She was wide awake.



“I think we just met The Thrumming.”



“Okay, so what do we do?”



“We leave.”



“And go where?! Stay at a hotel? What if it follows us? *Can* it follow us?”



“I don’t know.”



We sat in the living room, jumping at every noise, for the rest of the night. But nothing came to get us. No creature lumbered its way from the bathroom. No masked psycho burst from the closet. The only noise was the gradual birdsong from the forest outside, as the dawn peeked through the windows.



Our first move was to try to get a hold of the previous homeowner, but it was like he vanished into thin air. We tried every old folks home, assisted living place, and hospital in a wide radius, but none had a patient who matched his name. Next, we tried contacting Ruth.



“Ruth, we need to put the house back on the market. There’s a lot wrong with it. Termites. Holes in the roof. The water heater’s about to explode.” I threw every lie I could out there.



I could hear her smile stretch on the other side of the phone. “But Samuel- the inspections came back fine. If you don’t like the look of the house, it’s alright to admit it. After all, I *did* try to warn you, didn’t I? But no one listens to me.”



I wanted to slam my head against the wall. “No, it’s not that, Ruth. There are just a lot of things that we don’t like about this house. Can’t you help us out?”



There was a pause. “Samuel, maybe you just need to give it some time. If you still feel this way after a few months-”



I hung up on her. We didn’t have the funds for staying at a hotel for the long term, along with making payments on our new mortgage, so we were forced to live with it. For a month, we would take turns taking showers, and every time, we would hear The Thrumming in our heads, mixing with the water running down our spines. We could feel its presence, smell its breath- a boiled egg left in the sun for three days, garnishing a glass of curdled milk and sardine juice. We followed every rule- we kept our eyes clothed, showered alone, and kept the door locked. We didn’t fully understand rule four yet.



That changed.



I had just come back home from a jog, catching Linda on the way out for groceries. She kissed me on the cheek, as I watched her pull out of the driveway and down the road. I made my way over to the bathroom to wash the layer of sweat that I was wearing like a coat. My new shower ritual started like normal- water on, close eyes, hop in. I’d gotten better at feeling around for the soap and hair wash, though it was still tough to fully ignore The Thrumming.



Out of the bathroom, I heard the crashing of glass. Then, Linda’s voice:



“Shoot! Sam, I need your help! This vase got me good, I’m bleeding!”



Panicked about how badly she may have hurt herself, I was about to open my eyes to turn off the shower and quickly grab my clothes, when I stopped.



*I just saw Linda drive off.*



“Sam? Sam, please, it’s pretty bad. I need a towel or something.” It continued to speak, just like how my wife would when she’s afraid.



Slowly, I resumed my shower, and the frightened voice outside dissolved into the Thrumming noise, back in my skull.



We had to be more careful from that day on. Knocks on the window, voices in the home, and sounds of missed calls were occasionally sprinkled in to our shower sessions. The Thrumming was doing whatever it could to get us to take one little peek. As awful as it sounds, it became the new normal. Linda and I became good at blocking any distractions, focusing on our shower thoughts more than anything else. We tried not to think about how much worse it could get, or how much longer we’d have to deal with it. Instead, our focus was on research, trying to see if anyone else had dealt with a situation like this. We were in the middle of looking for exorcists in our local area when my wife got a frantic call from her mother.



Apparently, Ruth got into an argument at a local restaurant. She decided to use some… choice words towards a young waitress, and what’s worse, this ‘interaction’ was recorded by several bystanders.



“Linda, I don’t feel safe in my own home anymore! The whole community has it out for me!” Her harpy screech tore through the phone's speaker.



I mimed playing the world’s smallest violin, grinning ear to ear. Linda glared daggers at me before speaking. “Well, Mom, I’m really sorry to hear that, but I don’t know what you want us to do about it.”



“Well, I just need to get away for a bit. Let this all blow over. You got a spare bedroom there, right?”



My smile was obliterated. I shook my head vehemently, mouthing “No no no no no no-”



“Mom, that’s asking a lot…”



“I know it is, dear, but listen. You still want to sell that house? Let me stay with you for a bit, and I promise, I’ll get that house back on the market for you, and get you as close to what you bought it for as possible.”



Linda and I stared at each other. I could tell we were on the same wavelength- *this could be it. If we let Ruth stay with us for a week or two, maybe she could even see what we’re dealing with. She could help get us out of here.*



“Alright, deal. Come on over, we’ll get the guest bedroom ready for you.”



In the time it took her to come over, we ran through the game plan multiple times on how we’d try to explain what’s going on in the house. We were as confident as we were going to be when we heard the knock on our door.



I opened the door for her. “Hey Ruth, come on in-”



She pushed me aside, her hands full of two suitcases, packed to the brim. “I haven’t eaten yet. Did you have dinner yet? Get a pot of coffee started for me.” She ordered, dropping her suitcases with a thud.



“Ruth, before all that, can we-”



“LINDA? Linda where-” she spotted Linda sitting in the conversation pit. “Oh, there you are. Get these suitcases unpacked for me, will you? It’s been such a rough day, I just want to eat, shower, and rest.”



Our eyes grew wide at the word *shower.*



“Mom, about that, can you come sit for a second? We need to talk to you about-”



“Yes, hun, we’ll have plenty of time to talk after I’ve eaten and freshened up-”



My wife rose from her seat and pointed at the chair next to her. “MOM. We need to talk NOW, or I'll throw your suitcases into the forest. Now SIT.” I’ve never heard her talk to her mother like that, but desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess.



There was a moment where Ruth seemed stunned, before she resumed her normal, miserable demeanor.



“Alright, alright, dear. You don’t have to talk to me like that. I’m not a child. We’re all adults here.” She placed herself gingerly on the couch. I was biting my tongue so hard, I felt like I nearly tore it off.



Linda took the lead. “Mom, this house may be...haunted. Or cursed. We’re not quite sure. It doesn’t matter. Point is- there’s something bad with us here. We’ve been following some rules given to us by the previous owner, and it’s the only thing keeping us alive.” She pulled out the original note and handed it to Ruth, who was abnormally silent. Her eyes swept the small paper, line by line. Finally, she spoke.



“Do you take me for some sort of idiot?” She snarled, throwing the paper at Linda. “You have to make up some dumb monster because you’re too much of a coward to say you don’t want me here?”



“Ruth, enough-”



She wheeled her attention my way, pointing a finger at me. “Shut your mouth! It was probably *YOUR* idea, wasn’t it? You good for nothing waste of SPACE! The worst day of my life was the day you married Linda!” She couldn’t spew the vitriol fast enough from her mouth. She stood, fists balled, face red.



“Mom, enough! We’re telling the truth!” We both stood, watching her move with a purpose down the hallway.



“Yeah? I’ll be the judge of that! When nothing happens, I’ll be on my way, so you don’t have to deal with me ever again!” Rage echoed alongside her footsteps as she threw the bathroom door open.



“MOM, NO, WAIT!” Linda cried. I grabbed her before she could chase after her.



“Linda, no, we can’t go in there.” I held her in place, facing her away from the bathroom.



My gut lurched when I heard the shower turn on.



One Mississippi.



“Shut your eyes, Linda. Quick!” I tried to console her, as we both knew what was coming.



Two Mississippi.



Three Mississippi.



Ruth’s boisterous voice echoed from the small bathroom. “WHERE’S YOUR CREATURE, HUH? I DON’T SEE IT. IS IT SHY?”



Four Mississippi.



Five Mississippi.



I just held Linda in my arms, as she sobbed, already mourning the loss of her mother.



Six Mississippi.



Seven Mississippi.



I looked down the hall, into the bathroom, where Ruth stood yelling. A tiny part of me thought even someone like her didn’t deserve whatever was about to happen.



Eight Mississippi.



Nine Mississippi.



I turned and shut my eyes.



“YOU MAKE ME SICK, YOU UNGRATEFUL-”



Ten Mississippi.



Ruth’s rage-filled ramblings instantly became soul-piercing screams. I’ve never heard a human make those noises before. Shrieks of mortal terror so loud I could hear her vocal chords tearing, squelched by the gurgle of what I assumed was blood. Wet ripping sounds echoed down the hallway, punctuated by the heavy thud of something heavy hitting the ground. Linda and I sat in each other’s arms for some time before I began to crawl on my hands and knees towards the bathroom, eyes still shut. I needed to turn off the shower.



I could feel the transition from carpet to cold tile, and as I moved forward, a warm liquid coated my hands. I followed the noise of the running water, ignoring the reverberating hum in my head. My hands bumped into something on the floor, and I recoiled immediately, knowing exactly who I just made contact with. I awkwardly lifted myself up onto the edge of the tub and blindly groped the wall, finding the shower handle, and turning it off with a whining hiss. I waited in that room until The Thrumming was long gone. I won’t describe to you what was left of Ruth.



So, that’s where we are now. With all that’s just gone on, Linda and I have decided to put our only plan left in action, which is why I’m writing this. We weren’t looking for priests before Ruth arrived. We were planning this post. Whoever you are, you’re probably a good person, but Linda and I can’t handle this much longer, so I had to go with whoever reads this first. I’m sorry. I hope you’ll forgive me. It’s nothing personal.



So I’ve hidden a rule from you. Our guess is that maybe whatever this thing is, it may not be tied to the house. I think the only reason it’s stayed here is because the old couple before us never broke rule 5. It makes sense- had they broken rule 5 back in their day, the whole town would’ve come after them. The townspeople would’ve known who told them. But in this day and age, on the internet? Anonymity has its perks. So if my theory is correct, you might buy us some time, or maybe even make it leave us alone. In fairness, however, I want to give you the rules one more time. All of them.



Rule 1: From ten seconds after the shower is turned on until ten seconds after the shower is turned off, ***do not open your eyes.*** You need to keep your eyes closed, so you don’t see it. You’ll know when it’s watching you.



Rule 2: When showering, only one person should be in the bathroom. More people means more chances of someone breaking the rules.



Rule 3: When showering, keep the bathroom door locked, so no one accidentally walks in and sees it.



Rule 4: ***Ignore what it says to you.*** It will only get better at tempting you to open your eyes. Don’t.



Rule 5: Do not tell anyone about this thing. The secret needs to stay with you, in this house. Don't let it get out.",2,1755227368.0,u_Lime-Time-Live,1,1.0,False

1mqlu57,https://i.redd.it/o65kdz5tn3jf1.jpeg,"Packed with zucchini and green peas, these hearty vegan fritters are inspired by traditional Bhojpuri snack “Bhabra”.","You don't need exact measurements for this recipe

1 zucchini, 1 cup thawed green peas, 1"" piece ginger, grated, 1/2 cup onion sliced, 2 green chilies, chopped, 1/3 tsp red chili powder, Salt to taste, 1/2 cup rice flour, 3/4 cup besan ( gram flour), Water as required, Additional spices. as per your taste

Grate the zucchini using a coarse grater (you should get about 2 cups).

Add the thawed green peas, onion, green chilies, and grated ginger.

Sprinkle the rice flour and besan on top. Add salt, red chili powder, and any additional spices you're using. Mix with a spoon.

Slowly add water to make a thick, pancake-like batter. (If the mixture gets too loose, add more flour.)

Heat enough oil in a large frying pan to coat the bottom of the pan. Heat over medium heat. Once it starts to shimmer, add heaped tablespoons of the mixture in a clockwise arrangement, so you can remember which fritter to flip first. Don't overcrowd. Flatten each Fritter / Bhabra slightly.

Flip once the bottoms are golden, about 2–3 minutes. Cook until both sides are crisp and golden brown.

Drain on a paper towel or wire rack (I prefer a wire rack).

Enjoy them as a snack with chutney alongside tea or coffee, or serve as a side for breakfast or brunch.

1mqlrhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartAttack/comments/1mqlrhd/heart_attack_on_tuesday/,Heart Attack on Tuesday,"On Tuesday, August 12, I was preparing to shower at about 1PM. I’ve had triple bypass in March, 2024 but my only real symptoms were shortness of breath and, at times hesitancy in speaking or thinking. 

I reached for my towel and I felt a sudden pressure on my chest. I’ve had some sharp pain, mostly from GERD related issues, so I chewed a Tums. That didn’t do anything and the chest pain got worse. It was like my heart was being squeezed. 

Then I noticed a burning pain moving down the inside of my left arm and at the same time, I broke into a sweat. 

Thinking I didn’t want to be found naked I pulled on some clothing and shoes and called my wife, telling her “Don’t freak out, but I think I am having a heart attack.” She responded with a loving “I’m hanging up, call 911!” And she did hang up. 

I called 911. The Fire Chief of our community lives up the street and happened to be at home having lunch. 

Two minutes after I called 911 he was banging on my front door. I let him in and he pointed to my chair and said “Better get comfortable, it’s fixing [we are in Texas] to get busy in here.” 

Over his shoulder I saw the Mobile ICU pull up. In a few seconds five EMTs were looking down at me, attaching EKG leads to me. One guy put in an IV and then one of the EMTs said “Look at Lead 12!” 

The senior EMT said “Ok, we are going now.” Off my chair to the stretcher and out to the ambulance. Ran the EKG again and talked about Lead 12. 

Then they told the driver to speed up. We were already doing lights and sirens. The senior EMT said “Ok, when we get there, don’t go into ER, he’s going straight to the cath lab.”

Maybe 15 minutes after I called 911 I was being rolled into the cathedral lab and stripped and poke and prodded. They started to shave my right leg and saw a scar and then looked at my chest and saw the bypass scar, so everything switched to the left said. 

I was given light sedation (called it “2&2”) and, as it happened, my cardiologist was on duty. 

I felt like I was on the table for 20 minutes, but my wife (and daughter, who is an ER nurse) said it was closer to an hour. 

Two stents were inserted, one in the mid-circumflex and another in an aneurysm that had formed. 

About 3 hours after I called 911 I was being rolled into my room. I stayed the night and was released the next afternoon. 

Doing some medication changes and going back to cardiac rehab. Kidney doctor getting involved too. 

I plan on stopping by the Fire Station and dropping off bags of coffee and some home made fudge nut bars. 

I am amazed that modern medicine enabled me, from serious heart attack to home in 26 hours. ",6,1755227101.0,HeartAttack,2,1.0,False

Within a half hour pf eating it, I got real nauseous and it lasted about an hour. No vomiting. But, for the past 2 weeks, I have not been able to poop much. I am eating an awful lot less but, I am eating.

Went to the ER, this past saturday. Blood tests, EKG, Xrays. Everything that came back shows nothing. No blockage, all blood results were fine. 

I've been eating a lot of fruit as per instruction. Apples, pears. Also chicken and white rice. I even tried eating some unhealthy items like oreos, drank a can of coke.  But the healthy stuff I'm eating, I'm not eating much of it.  I'm terrified. It really feels like somehthing is bliocked below the mid sternum. But that feeling is on and off. I feel good actually, no fever etc. Just not fn pooping. It's driving me insane. 

The only thing that seems to work is hot black coffee, early in the morning. I can usually pass a bowel but they've been super tiny and not much at all. I have an ER follow up to morrow with my dr.

1mqlo2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1mqlo2i/oldest_daughter_syndrome/,Oldest daughter syndrome,"I’m 20 y o female, and I need advice. 

For context, I’m minorly physically disabled (joint issues) and also have multiple mental illnesses including depression, ocd, and anxiety. 

I grew up with severe adhd, OCD and was bullied a lot. It was a problem for me to make friends and as a result, I have none. My only friends are long distance from the state over, but I transferred out of my last college and moved home and transferred to an online one because the curriculum was not what I thought it was for my major nor worth my money. When I say I have no friends I mean that genuinely. I have no one to go hang out with, no one to have coffee with. And before you ask I HAVE tried to be integrated in other communities/ groups. But it’s never worked out. The last group I was in, I was excluded from a big party the group had and had to see them post about it on socials the following day.

Due to my OCD and circumstances my parents have always financially supported me. Which I have never taken for granted. As a result in the last few years, I have made a ton of accomplishments. Not minor ones, very good big ones (not to brag I promise just to get context across) that any parent/ family member would be proud of. I work in tv production and have hit a few milestones that my parents have been proud of. 

My parents this past year have especially been financially supporting me because I had to quit my job due to those issues (especially the joint ones. My job made it way worse). They’ve always paid for my phone bill, don’t charge me rent etc. They’ve been really supportive of me especially during unemployment. Which is why I’ve tried to always make them proud and in fairness have had to pay for a lot of my own necessities even if it’s not a few of my bills. I’ve had to pay others. 

This past year has been h-ll. My parents, because of my issues with bullying, and even ab-se I faced from adults due to my mental health issues, have always been the ones I could rely on. At first when I moved home everything was fine. 

Until it wasn’t.

I have a younger sister. She’s 17 and is also in a position of one long distance friend. Due to her own highschool being bad, she also does online school. And guitar lessons once a week. Outside of that she does nothing. She spends 90% of her time in her room and never goes out. She doesn’t have any disabilities. She also doesn’t have a job after she graduated highschool. In this last year, my parents and I have started arguing. Out of the blue. Every day (and I mean every. Single. Day.) they will be angry with me over something. Something little or minor (like a cup left out or a piece of laundry that fell from the dryer.) For more context, I am a very well behaved 20 year old. I don’t get drunk, I don’t act risky, I don’t spend hours into the night. Not like there’s anything necessarily WRONG with that, but I’m the kid a parent wouldn’t have to worry about getting into trouble. And when we argue, I have never once called my parents any kind of crude names, sworn at them, told them insults etc just for context. I never misbehave. But my parents everyday jump at the chance to find something I did wrong.

My sister has faced zero issues with my parents. My parents never get angry with her over anything, even if she did something that’s actually bad or worth being frustrated about. For example even with doing a lot I stay in my room a lot of the time but not more than my sister. My parents have gotten frustrated with me over that. Knowing my issues and having no friends. But my sister? They never bring it up to her. Ever. Even with me going out and having 10-15 hour days they wouldn’t drop it with me. 

In these last months I’ve tried my hardest to find another job. But because of the state of the economy after hundreds of applications in both my field and in other fields I haven’t been able to find one. I started to get depressed again. But what made me more depressed was my parents and how they treated me. One minute they praise me for an accomplishment, and the next jump on the chance to be angry with me. It’s like whiplash. Then they wonder why I don’t want to spend time with them. 

I have tried talking to them honestly about how I feel. They shut me down and disregard me every single time. They talk about their PAST support but they’re not seeing that how they’re treating me NOW is affecting me. How they treat my little sister completely different affects me. My mom agreed to not be frustrated with me for one day. The result of that one day was her locking herself in her room and my parents ignoring me for the rest of the day. Why? Because I thought it was safe to talk about my feelings again about eldest daughter syndrome and had sent a text about it. It mentioned the TERM not a full on explaination. 

For years my mental health stole my life and made me an outcast and I finally got to a place where I did more than a lot of people do in their lifetime. I thought I could finally make my parents proud of me. But the pride in me doesn’t even last for a minute. I keep having to perform and when I do perform they still act like they resent me. Maybe it’s years of pent up anger. I don’t know. All I know is my parents love me but don’t like me.

My parents gave me a deadline to find a job (job market makes it out of my control) and then they’ll cut my phone bill off. And have no more grocery money (the fridge is free to use but I have a weekly allowance because of food allergies and ibs). They’re going to cut off the one thing that connects me to anything socially due to something out of my control. 

I need advice on this situation in general. Im not perfect but im not a horrible daughter. I just want my parents to be proud of my for a full day and not be angry with me for at least two. And to not be treated differently than my sister. ",2,1755226836.0,FamilyIssues,1,1.0,False

# Best Courier Bag 2025: Top Picks + Expert Buying Guide

Courier bags have evolved from simple messenger bags used by bike messengers to sophisticated accessories for professionals,students,and urban dwellers. Choosing teh right courier bag can significantly enhance your daily carry experience, providing secure and organized storage for your essentials. This guide will explore the top courier bags of 2025, highlighting their key features, benefits, and ideal user profiles to help you make an informed decision. We'll also delve into crucial factors to consider before making a purchase, ensuring you find the perfect bag to suit your needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern courier bag offers a variety of features designed to optimize comfort, security, and functionality. These bags are not just about carrying items; they're about integrating seamlessly into your lifestyle, whether you're commuting, working from a coffee shop, or exploring a new city.

**Material and durability:** The optimal courier bag is constructed from high-quality, weather-resistant materials such as ballistic nylon, Cordura, or waxed canvas. These fabrics offer excellent abrasion resistance, ensuring the bag can withstand daily wear and tear. Reinforced stitching and robust hardware, like metal buckles and YKK zippers, further contribute to the bag's longevity. A durable water repellent (DWR) finish provides added protection against light rain and spills, keeping your belongings safe and dry.

**Storage Capacity and Association:** A well-designed courier bag will provide ample storage space with dedicated compartments for laptops, tablets, documents, and accessories. Look for padded laptop sleeves that can accommodate devices up to 15 or 16 inches, along with multiple internal pockets for organizing smaller items like pens, phones, and chargers. External pockets, such as zippered front pockets or water bottle holders, offer convenient access to frequently used items without having to open the main compartment.**Comfort and Ergonomics:** Given that courier bags are often carried for extended periods, comfort is paramount. Adjustable shoulder straps with padded shoulder pads help distribute weight evenly and prevent strain. A cross-body stabilizer strap further enhances comfort by preventing the bag from swinging excessively while cycling or walking. Breathable mesh backing promotes airflow and reduces sweating, especially during warmer months.

**Security Features:** Protecting your belongings from theft is a critical consideration. Some courier bags incorporate security features such as hidden pockets, RFID-blocking compartments to prevent electronic theft, and lockable zippers. Tamper-proof closures and reinforced straps add an extra layer of security, deterring potential thieves and providing peace of mind while traveling or commuting in crowded areas.

**Water Resistance & Weatherproofing:** Beyond material choice, construction techniques play a critical role in weather resistance. look for features like taped seams, which prevent water from seeping in through the stitching. A roll-top closure or an integrated rain cover offers superior protection in heavy rain conditions. The ability to withstand various weather conditions is essential for maintaining the integrity of your valuable items.

**Aesthetics and Style:** While functionality is key, the aesthetics of a courier bag are also critically important. Courier bags are available in a wide range of styles,from minimalist designs to more rugged and utilitarian options. Consider the overall aesthetic and choose a bag that complements your personal style and professional image. The color, shape, and overall design should align with your preferences and the contexts in which you'll be using the bag.

## Core Benefits

Courier bags are more than just convenient storage solutions; they offer tangible benefits that enhance productivity, comfort, and peace of mind.

**Improved Organization and Efficiency:** A well-organized courier bag allows you to quickly access your belongings, saving time and reducing frustration.

**Enhanced Comfort and Portability:** Compared to traditional backpacks or briefcases,courier bags offer a more comfortable and ergonomic carrying experience. The cross-body design distributes weight evenly, reducing strain on your shoulders and back. Adjustable straps and padded shoulder pads further enhance comfort, allowing you to carry the bag for extended periods without discomfort.

**Increased Security and Peace of Mind:** Built-in security features, such as hidden pockets and lockable zippers, provide added protection against theft, especially in crowded urban environments. Knowing that your valuable belongings are secure allows you to focus on your daily tasks without worrying about potential risks. This is invaluable for travelers, commuters, and anyone who carries sensitive information.

**Professional Image and Style:** A stylish and well-maintained courier bag projects a professional image, whether you're meeting with clients, attending classes, or working from a coffee shop.

The adaptable design allows you to carry everything from laptops and documents to gym clothes and groceries with ease.

## FAQs Section

**What size courier bag should I choose?**
The ideal size depends on your typical carrying needs. For laptops and a few essentials,a 12-15 liter bag may suffice. If you need to carry more items, such as books, documents, or a change of clothes, consider a larger bag with a capacity of 18-25 liters. Evaluate the dimensions of your laptop and other frequently carried items to ensure they will fit comfortably in the bag's designated compartments.

**How do I clean and maintain my courier bag?**
Cleaning methods vary depending on the bag's material. For most nylon or Cordura bags, spot cleaning with a damp cloth and mild detergent is sufficient. Waxed canvas bags may require specialized cleaning products to maintain their water-resistant properties. Regularly empty the bag of debris and avoid overfilling it to prevent needless wear and tear. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning and maintenance guidelines.

**Are courier bags suitable for cycling?**
Yes, courier bags are specifically designed for cycling.Look for features such as a stabilizer strap to prevent the bag from swinging, a breathable mesh back panel to keep you cool, and weather-resistant materials to protect your belongings from rain. Some courier bags also include reflective elements for added visibility in low-light conditions. Ensure that the bag fits snugly against your back and does not interfere with your pedaling motion.**What is the difference between a messenger bag and a courier bag?**
While the terms are often used interchangeably, there are subtle differences. Courier bags typically feature a more streamlined design, prioritize functionality and durability, and are specifically designed for cycling.messenger bags may have a more relaxed style, with a greater emphasis on aesthetics and versatility. Consider your primary use case when choosing between the two. If you're a cyclist who prioritizes performance, a courier bag is your best bet.

I just moved from Alaska to the Squirrel Hill/Shadyside area with my spouse, our kitty, and our dog :^) We’re both queer, and I’m ADHD + ADHD/autistic.
It’s been a big jump from rural Alaska, and while I’m still settling in, I’m also a little overwhelmed (in a good way!) by how much there is to do here. I’ve got a wide range of interests, so here’s a little about all that:

Psychology– I just finished my degree and love to chat about it, especially social psychology and chronic illness psychology.

Sci-fi & fantasy – The Three Body Problem and The Expanse are my favorites, but I’m into both books and TV/movies.

Book club??? – I read a lot and I’m open to most genres. 

Gamin– Skyrim, Minecraft, Webfishing, Animal Crossing, and I’ve been getting into the new Dune game. I’m genuinely very bad but I have a good time lol

Art – Currently into beading/jewelry making, but I’ve done pottery, painting, and chalk pastels. Stained glass is next on my list to try I think

Local coffee & food – Looking for great coffee spots in Squirrel Hill/Shadyside (bonus points if they’re dog-friendly!) and new restaurants to check out 

Harp – I've always wanted to learn to play. If anyone knows local harp teachers or plays themselves, I would be eternally grateful for any resources there. 

Also I know absolutely nothing about the flora/fauna here so if you're into that I would love to listen to you talk about it and learn

1mqle2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/1mqle2p/story_time_an_atheist_jew_shows_up_at_an_orthodox/,Story time: An atheist Jew shows up at an Orthodox synagogue for support …,"Just had the worst week in my life. I’m not soliciting any sympathy and definitely don’t want any questions :) Suffice to say, life is already getting better. I just wanted to share this story (that will be meandering and long, sorry) about the amazing support provided to me in a completely foreign space.

Anyway, story time! Awful week. I was a total emotional wreck, honestly. Saturday night I was just spiraling and on a whim, decided what I really needed was not only spiritual guidance but community support, so I looked up the closest synagogues in my area. I strongly preferred Reform as it’s closest to my own ideals, and I really, really enjoyed visiting Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan some time ago.

Shoot … really only Orthodox ones! No biggie, I needed something, *anything*. I made some calls to ask if any were open or accepting visitors so to speak, but go no replies, but said “screw it” and just drove to the closest one a few minutes away. I pulled up and knocked on the doors of a building in my area I’d never seen before, but found them locked. As I was ready to walk away, suddenly, they opened, and an awfully confused Jewish boy looked out at me. Guys, let me explain I showed up to this place dressed just in a freaking sleeveless tee, my gym short shorts, and running shoes. I at least had the wherewithal to think to take a hoodie …

Anyway, even showing up like that, even barely being able to get out, “Please, if there’s any way I can stay just for a little bit, sitting in the corner and not interrupting anybody, I’d really appreciate it,” the rabbi let me in. He was, as you can only imagine, confused as all hell, but to my surprise let me come in and take a seat. It was a small synagogue. Actually my first time in one since my Birthright trip in the summer of 2022, and that Birthright trip was my first time ever being in a synagogue in my life, period.

It’s complicated, but basically, I’m a Russian Jew with parents who are unfortunately vehemently in opposition to their genetic identity. I took a 23andMe test some years ago and guess what: 100% Ashkenazi Jewish. What could that mean about mom and dad then, lol?

Anyway, as I was sitting there just trying to calm down and gather my thoughts, it was either the rabbi or this other man who gave me reading material to pray along with. I opened it meekly and read a few lines. Shortly thereafter, a man came up to me and sat next to me. This guy—like everyone else in there, frankly—saw the distress I was under and just started having a conversation with me: who I was, where I was from, my background, what brought me there, and all that good stuff. I am fully aware I probably looked like a huge security threat LOL. I have nothing to hide so told him that while I wasn’t religious or spiritual, I just really needed some guidance in that moment.

Anyway, even simply having a conversation with this kind man got my mind off my racing thoughts. I was able to focus on our conversation and the questions I had about Judaism instead of the shit in my head. He was a lifesaver in that moment. He offered me coffee and food too, and although I had no appetite, I gladly accepted the coffee.

Let’s follow along, folks. So far, a very distressed stranger dressed incredibly inappropriately for an Orthodox synagogue (or any synagogue, really) showed up at a Shabbat service, was warmly let it in, and offered food and coffee. It gets better.

A few more men came up and introduced themselves to me and showed nothing but respect and warmth even though, again, I was dressed like I had just come straight from the gym (this actually was, in fact, my regular gym attire lol). The service started, they told me what pages to flip to, and I made an effort to read along the English translations.

Afterwards, guys, both (!) the rabbi and this man invited me to their homes, I mean their *homes*—me, a total stranger they’d met just a couple hours ago—with their families, and in the rabbi’s case, the other men in the service. Since the man invited me first, I took him up on his offer. We walked to his home and he asked me to wait outside for a moment while he told his wife about me (he didn’t have a cell phone to call her). Thereafter I was invited in and met his wife and eight (!) children. They treated me so kindly, guys. They seemingly could not care less that besides our common Jewish link, I was nothing like them. I participated in their Shabbat dinner and his wife gave me food and drink. I had a great conversation getting to know them a little bit better while simultaneously entertaining their three-year-old who was seemingly bringing me EVERY toy in his toy boxes lmao. He was super cute and thankfully, I’m good with kids. The other kids were giggling while I said silly things to and played with this little one.

We finished up dinner and I profusely thanked him and his wife for their hospitality, after which we headed back to the synagogue to finish up the service.

All in all, I left there feeling about a million times better than when I had walked in just a few short hours before. Again, let’s do a quick recap: a complete stranger, emotionally distressed and clothed like a gym goer, randomly showed up at an Orthodox synagogue and admitted he wasn’t even religious, but was offered knowledge, food, drink, and a sense of comfort and community.

I am truly forever grateful to that synagogue, that rabbi, those men, and I think most of all that man who sat down with me to talk, get to know me, and even invite me to his freaking home. Words cannot describe my gratitude. I definitely won’t be a regular goer—it’s just not my lifestyle or beliefs or anything I was brought up in, honestly—but that place and those people and that very special, slightly odd night will always have a place in my heart. I need to go back there again.

Thank you, random Orthodox synagogue a few minutes away from me. Thank you rabbi and those at the service. Thank you, kind man with your kind wife and crazy toddler and children. That night did so much more for me than they could’ve realized. I am forever grateful.

Somehow, this sense of genuine *community* was extended even to me, and all because I was simply a Jew too.

I happened to have $150 in gift cards (from credit card reward points I had earned) and offered to use them to purchase a ready-to-assemble lift top coffee table for her apartment. (She has been using 1 foldable TV tray in front of her sofa for everything: to eat off of, to use for her laptop, to hold her many bottles of medicines, etc.)

I let her choose the table and volunteered to assemble it for her. I had the table delivered to my home and transported it to her apartment for the assembly.

As soon as I took the table parts out of the box she complained that it looked “cheap.”

When it was mostly assembled she complained that it looked “too big” for her living room.

After it was assembled she complained that the drawers were on the “wrong side” and the table “won't work” for her.

It took me 4 hours to assemble the table so I was feeling pretty fed up. I showed her the online listing for the table and reminded her that this was the table she picked out.

I told her that it's rude to complain about and insult a gift to the gift giver's face. She told me that it wasn't really a “gift” because I hadn't spent any money on it.

I told her that she was free to do what she wants with the table if it's not to her liking (sell it, donate it, throw it out…) but that I wouldn't be doing anything more with it myself.

She complained that I was taking her comments too personally and that I didn't have to get so upset about things because she wasn't blaming me for her disappointment. I told her that her complaints were insulting.

Thoughts? Something I can do inside, preferably with a mug of coffee in reach. Bonus points if it’s creative but doesn’t end with me regretting the mess.",1,1755225659.0,Hobbies,3,1.0,False

Just had my full-hysto (uterus, tubes, cervix) this morning at 7:30am. My care team was so great (go St. Luke’s!) and my gyno was also my surgeon so we were familiar with each other already. We were out the door by about 1:30 after I ate some toast, peed soooo much, and the dizziness went away. I was walking really well. 

I am F33. I’ve been dealing with bad period pain and symptoms (fever, vomiting, missing life events) since I was about 13. Back then, I would tell people to just put an egg beater in me and scramble! Boy, did that get looks… 
But it has been a dream of mine since a year into menstruation, I just didn’t have the words or knowledge to articulate my needs. But here we are 20 years later, and this puppy is O U T! 

It’s  out baby!!

It also helps that I never wanted children, so that’s notable too. 
Bonus points for the political angle as well 👀

Anyway, 
Coming home I’m walking just fine. Even going stairs up and down with no obvious impacts. 
I get up every 20-40 minutes to pee, so I’m walking a lot lol.  
No nausea, but I’m also not needing the opioids given to me. Right now it’s just ice, heat, Tylenol and ibuprofen. 

We haven’t pooped yet but I’ve been taking colace since Monday and I’ve also added Senna (?) tea today on top of some prunes. Now that it’s night time, I feel my intestines finally waking up to move. Tomorrow morning’s plan is MiraLAX in my coffee, continue colace, continue prunes, continue tea. I feel it won’t be long. 

Now for the pain… what pain?? lol. 
That’s not entirely fair, because the gas is a little uncomfortable in my back and shoulders but that’s where most of my focus is. The incisions themselves (3 on tummy, 1 internal) feel like the most mild of cramps in my book. My periods were like a pain level 8, and these are a pain level 2 at best. 
Peeing was fine. They used a catheter but it’s not bad, just a little twingey. 
I do have a little blood that I’m managing with pads. 

Last but not least, my appetite is unexpected. I camped out on this sub for months. Bought all the things, bought all the meds, planned and planned again - but I missed this: I’m ravenous. 

I’m sticking to really soft foods to be kind to my stomach for the weekend but I am dreaming of all the junk food. There’s no nausea for me, and all my food prep expected nausea lol. I’m about to force my partner to buy me a whole ass cake or a hoagie. 


Okay I lied…one last thing: I’m so energetic?? Minus one hour-long nap, I’m an alert fool. What?!

Whew. Thanks for reading that. I’ve been pleasantly surprised and so has my care team. 

Someone send me tasty not-good-for-me-food 😭

Hypothetically, you're running a batch coffee operation in Indonesia, currently making about 1,000 cups/day. Right now, the modus operandi is using a single-group espresso machine, which requires a very consistent barista hand to operate all day. It works for now, but in the long run, I personally think it’s not the most efficient setup (CMIIW). The plan is to double output by the end of the year.

I have a couple of questions for anyone who’s worked with large-scale espresso production:

1. Is it realistically possible to make **a large amount of espresso using only one piece of equipment**, while still keeping the water-to-coffee ratio consistent?
2. If yes, do you have any equipment recommendations (brands/models) I could check out for reference?

Disclaimer: I’m honestly just curious and want to understand what kind of scaling is possible for espresso production. Who knows, this knowledge might come in handy for future coffee adventures.

The graveled road cut through the thicket of the forest for ages. Ruts and dips riddled along washed out sections. Branches from the trees on both sides reached out in an attempt to grab any passing vehicle. The truck's suspension creaked and groaned with every bump along it. I could not see any animals in the brush, but the quiet of the night and road which looked untouched for years led me to the conclusion that they were most definitely there, and they were watching me awkwardly putting my vehicle along.

How could a road like this lead to any sort of town? And, how was it the only one? And why was this town the only way onto I-60? Does it cut so far from any other road? Surely, mathematically, it has to cross with a better trimmed area.

The thunder from before started to hammer heavy in the sky now. Streaks of lightning blocked by the infinite branches above, but felt in spots of sky peaking through shifting from black to complete light. And, the forest underneath being momentarily lit at random intervals.

Soon enough came the rain. Whispy at first. Just droplets along the windshield. Then, heavier and heavier droplets began to plink, plink, plink on the metal roof. Heavy matted sounds of water hitting the dirt floor of the forest and the canopy of the trees joined in harmony with the truck. I didn't check the weather, but it was pretty early in the night, and I figured if Vodka Lake was a highway town I could stop. With the rain, half-full stomach, and quarter tank it was most likely a good idea to stop somewhere for the night.

The smell of the moist dirt wafted through mixtures of wet dust and ozone. It's a scent I don't get much of in the city. Or, the tires slipping ever so slightly in the gravel before the differential locks up. Nothing too serious. Just minor jerks here and there. Reminds me of drilling in the HMMWV's way back when. Though, I guess my truck is missing a couple tons of armor. 

The end of the gravel road pulled into a four way intersection main road alongside a neon lit town. Every building looked pristine, but there was hardly any traffic. On the other corner of the intersection read in Postcard Graphic:

“Welcome to…
Vodka Lake.
‘a swell place to pass through…”

And, under the signage showed three more signs. The onramps for both I-60 E & W were straight ahead. Other side of town I'd reckon. The sign under them at the very bottom was for a place called: “Anthemoessa's Diner, Gas, and Room”. Sounded like asking good of a place as any to stop for the night.

Even for the rain, the town sat oddly hollow. And, pristine. It was like a stage built for a crowd that never came. Passing by street after street were groves of small-town businesses. I couldn't spot a single dwelling. Just large display front glass windows engorged in bright red laid brick.

It was mainstreet America rolling block past block. With signage that seemed to only point in a single direction: the one I was traveling. No cars sat street parked, and lots continued to be empty as I passed through them.

“What the fu….” I mouthed, shooting my eyes from left to right. If not for the bright enchantment of the city's glow, I would've figured this place was abandoned.

The rain strangely lifted as I pulled to the diner. Leaving just a wet reflective glimmer retracting the neon technicolor of the gas bulbs overhead the pumps of the building. The stop laid right side of a highway overpass. The road under the pass reading west and the road down the parking lot reading east.

“Interstate 60
 ← 290 mi: Karzo, MO
Gorge, KY: 222 mi →”

I had never heard of either of those towns.

“This is too liminal.” I whispered to myself.

The truck creaked as I parked her. My boots splashed a small puddle stepping out. Rain lightly tapped my leather jacket. The savory salty fat of pan fried pork links lingered heavily in the air. The kitchen was cooking my kind of food. And, if the neon glow of the diner lounge was any indicator: this was my kind of restaurant tag. It was full. Too full. Like somehow an entire messroom was fit into a family dinner.

“Welcome in, dear!” A waitress gleefully welcomed me, “Please have a seat anywhere, I'll be with you soon.”

“You guys sell the paper here?” I asked.

“By the door to your right, sweetie. Just grab one, we'll put it on your ticket.”

I flicked my wrist into the two two figure salute before grabbing a newspaper from the rack. I made my way towards the back, this place was abandoned stark contrast to the empty town leading up to here. The diner was jam-packed full of people, and conversation. Good old boy and gals. The conversations of them merged into a conglomerate of talk-noise, clanking of silverware against ceramic, and bellowed laughter. The crisped smell of blacktop cooked meals filled the diner lounge.

I didn't even crack the first page of my newspaper before I was startled by a waitress.

“So, what'll we be drinking tonight? Can I get you a soda, water, coffee?” she asked. Readjusting her nametag.

“Can I get a coffee, no sugar. And, a glass of water with a lemon.”

“Lovely!”

I looked around to find no menu on the table, and I'd seen the waitress hadn't brought one over.

“Hey, is there any chance I could get a menu real quick. If it's not too much.” 

“Oh, no bother, sweetie. You new?” She glanced at me from her guest check. Eyes piercing. Readjusting her name tag again.

“Uh, I guess so. I'm just passing through.”

“Yeah, that's what they all say. Well, don't worry about no menu. This is Anthemoessa's. Just order whatever you feel, and we'll fix it right up for ya.”

“Anything?”

“Yup. Hell, if you're hungry enough, we can bring you a whole hog. Just crawl right up his behind and fix you a ham sandwich,” she giggled. I reciprocated before she continued, “Seriously though, anything you want? Just order it right up.”

“Well,” I did have a lighter lunch, and wasn't planning on getting breakfast in the morning. I wanted to test how well they could accommodate an order, “In that case: lemme get a double order of eggs, scrambled. And, can I get sautéed onions and mushrooms on them, but not in. And, if you guys, got it, can I get a country fries steak with white gravy, but make it a twenty three ounce New York strip. And, I reckon I'll have a side of collard greens with that.”

“That all?” She said unbothered. Once again readjusting her god-damn nametag.

“I believe so…”

The ring of the bells on the door cut through the crowd as the door opened.

“Hey Darla!” The waitress shot awfully loud. “We got fresh stock in for you!”

“Oh, we'll that's just swell.” a sweet sultry starlight drawl answered back.

It was one of my horrible habits. I loved listening to other people's conversations. I had done it my whole life. Just tuning out the crowd to listen in to the happenings in other people's affairs. It was great at passing time. I opened my paper, feigned reading it, and decided to spend my time listening to the patrons around me.

“That's just horrible,” an old man in front of me said, exacerbated, “He just up and left?”

His constituent responded, “Yeah, yeah, in the dead of night.”

I had no context for the conversation, and I rarely did. Half the fun was making up scenarios and trying to fill in the blanks.

“...had just vanished. Last seen in Dewey. Some say he was eastbound on sixty.”

“We'll no shit! He been out this way? Or we know yet?”

“No clue. They got a marshal from out that way. Real no-bullshiter from what I've heard.”

This was getting interesting. The old man continued, ""Apparently trails gone cold past Normal. Ain't no one in Karzo seen him either.”

“You think he'd of taken off up the plains? I think there is a road that goes that way.”

God, I hope there isn't some psycho on the loose.

“Nah. Too close to the big guy's stash. Reason why you don't hear much trouble from that way. Hey, how's your girls doin?”

“Heya there stranger…” an ever smooth starlit southern drawl cut through my eavesdropping. Taken a back; I reoriented and collected myself as I locked eyes with whoever was trying to get my attention.

She was a dirty blonde with medium length curls. She shot an innocent smile revealing slightly crooked buck teeth. They almost fit her face perfectly with her sunkissed freckles and soft blue eyes.

“Sorry, do I know you?” I asked softly.

“No, but I saw you was over here by your lonesome, and figured you could use some company…” She retorted. 

I didn't give her a formal response. I simply shrugged my shoulders and pointed both hands to the seat adjacent to mine in the booth. She giggled as she adjusted her skirt to sit down.

She made sure to get real comfortable in the bench, and placed a napkin in her lap. Then she turned that syrupy smile on me and extended a hand.

“My name's Darlene,” she said, “But most people just call me Darla.” 

I grabbed her hand, gave it a polite shake, feigned a smile, and said, “Most folks just call me Lee.”

“Well, it sure is nice to meet you, Lee.”

“Mm.” I dipped my head into the newspaper. 

“You ain't from around here. Are you?”

“Not particularly.” 

“Me neither. I mean, I've been up and down this stretch. Mostly along sixty. But, this is my first time working it.”

Her eyes sparkled at that last part like she meant something different. “Say… why are you here?”

That made me look up.

“Well,” I said, folding the paper, “I don't even really know where here is. I'm just hauling cross-country. Heading east.”

“You taking sixty?” She asked, that shine behind her eyes hardening into something keeper. 

“Apparently. Never heard of the road, but it's supposed to take me to some town on the Eastern Seaboard.”

“Mmm,” she hummed, leaning forward just slightly, “It always does.”

“Here you are!” The waitress interjected, setting down my plate of food. She glanced at Darla, “Oh, hey there sweetie. Can I get you anything?”

“Just the usual, please.” 

“Black coffee it is. Just like the gentleman here.” She shot a wink at me, “You'll have to be careful with this one. She's a real trouble maker.”

Darla blushed, and I wanted to stick my head back into the newspaper. Anything to escape this soul tearing awkwardness.

“I'd like to pay now. How much I owe you for everything. I'll get her too.” I asked.

“Well, coffee and waters are free,” the waitress said, “It'll be about ten bucks for the food.”

I pulled out my billfold. I ran through it, and wondered if I should exact change the waitress. The thought always pops into my mind. I mean why should I have to pay their wage. I ultimately decided against it. And, not wanting to be the asshole who hands here a couple dollar bills; I reached for a twenty and slipped it to her through two fingers.

“Here you go,” I said, “Keep the change and the drinks coming.”

“Why thank you!” she said, “I'll be right back out with your coffees and water.”

Before she left, she shot a look to Darla, “Go easy on him now, hun” and they both laughed.

I couldn't place my finger on it, but their familiarity made me uneasy. Hell, this whole place made me uneasy. I genuinely had almost forgotten how bizarre everything was. And, this was just the start.

“So, big boy,” Darla said, walking her fingers up my arm, “When are you taking off”

“Morning sometime,” I didn't know why I told her that, “Why?”

“You said you were heading east along sixty. It just so happens I live out that way,” she began to pout her face. Her lips curled and she pierced my soul with the biggest set of cow eyes I'd ever seen, “And, I need a ride. Just to a little town along the way.”

“What's in it for me?” I asked.

“Making sure a sweet girl makes it back home safely. We got this town festival too.”

Most times in life I would only do what's best for me. Take the easiest path I could see. Just drive on by, and view the road of life through the rear view mirror. As I sat there eating my meal and looking into the eyes of this woman, I decided what the hell.

“I mean if it's along the way. Hell. I ain't staying for no festival though.”

Her eyes immediately lit up. If for a second, though, it seemed as if something sinister laid behind them before continuing on their gleeful path.

“Well ain't that swell,” her accent really came out, “If you want you can stay the night with me! I got a motel room!”

“Nah, mam. I'd rather sleep in my truck. I wouldn't want to impede.”

“Oh, hogwash…”

“I insist,” I interrupted her, “I'd rather sleep in the truck. Im the ole red beater out there.”

She pouted a little more. But, I have decency. I wasn't really fixing to shack up with someone I just met.

After dinner, we stepped onto the freshly wet pavement of the parking lot. Darla began making her way to the motel as I began to light a cigarette.

“Are you sure you don't want a nice cozy bed to sleep in?” She asked.

I took a draw of smoke before puffing, and held the cigarette down, “Nah, you go-on ahead. My truck will be in the lot here. Wake me up come morning.”

“Oh, alright. Be like that then,” she began to walk off solemnly before looking back, “Have a good night, Harry.”

“Night.”

I thought for a minute. That was odd. I don't remember ever giving her my first name. Maybe I just forgot.

I took another puff before ashing the tip of my cigarette on my boot. I stuck the rest of it back in my pack and headed over to bring the old beater into the pump. Opening up the cab gave me a reminder of a semblance of normal. I don't know how or why, but the smell of old cracked leather and dust from the cab against the wet almost neon aroma of the parking lot made the ladder a far cry of normalcy.

I checked under my seat for my ole .38 special. It was a dinky six shooter, and would make for a better paperweight than shooting iron. Don't want to risk some long con with this girl though, and, furthermore, I'm in an alien territory. I pulled in and started the pump.

The mist lingered. Heavy, like the land hadn’t quite exhaled. The light above pump four buzzed in arrhythmic seizures, and the click of the nozzle startled me even though I’d been staring at the numbers the whole time.

I twisted the cap shut. That’s when I saw him.

Perched on the ice chest like he owned the joint, tail lazily swaying over the ""Bagged in Store"" decal. Gaunt, matted, coat the color of mud and cigarette ash. A half-spent Marlboro dangled from his lips caught in between a fanged tooth and stretched gums.

“Pump four,” he said in a voice that sounded like a landslide through a throat. “Hell of a number to stop on.”

I just stared.

“You don’t belong here, Lee.”

“You a hallucination?” I asked, tugging at my coat. “Oh, what the fuck am I thinking,” I said chuckling to myself, “Of course you are.”

The Coyote squinted. Smiled slow.

“You’re not supposed to be on this path,” he said, blowing smoke sideways into the fog. “I mean that cosmically. You were supposed to keep drivin past that ole sign. This place, this road, it ain’t a truck stop, ain't a path for you Lee. It’s a sieve.”

“A sieve?”

“Ain’t no one ever gets out the way they came in.”

He jumped down with a grunt and circled me, slow. His claws clicked against the wet concrete.

“And it ain’t just you who gets rerouted. You gum up the whole damn engine when you break alignment.”

“With what?”

“With the latticework, son. With consequence. You’re the loose thread in the shirt. You don’t tear it out, the whole thing puckers up.”

He stopped in front of me. His amber eyes shimmered like glass in the gaslight.

“You think you’re some Joe Blow with a boxbed and a map that don’t show where he’s going, but you're a damned linchpin. A bad decision dressed in denim.”

“Okay,” I said, scratching my head. “And I suppose you’re Saint Peter in a fur coat.”

That got him.

He leaned back and let out a laugh—deep at first, but rising into a stuttering, barking howl that shook the fog.

“AHAHA! hoo! HAHAH! Saint Peter! Hell, son, I piss on welcome mats!”

He coughed out a lungful of smoke, wiped a tear from his eye with the back of a paw.

“You got spunk,” he said, finally. “Too bad you’re about to waste it.”

I turned, stepped toward the cab.

“You’ve said your piece. Now let me pump my gas in peace.”

“One last thing,” he called behind me.

I stopped.

“Next time you look in that girl's eyes and think it feels like home? Ask yourself if you’re lookin’ forward, or just backwards with the lights turned low. Don't matter how fast you go. Can't outrun the rearview.”

Sleep could not have come fast enough. Morning time come, I'm putting this place in that fucking rear view.",3,1755225427.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

The Internet’s Craziest Side Hustle Has Me SHOOK 🤯💸,"GUYS, am I missing something or is this the wildest side quest on the internet??? 😳🤯

So, I spent my Sunday lounging in bed eating chips (life is hard I know), randomly scrolling TikTok and Reddit. Suddenly I see a comment about folks making **effortless side cash** just from their PHONES… Like, why am I not doing that?! And truly, I was so skeptical at first.

I decided to give it a real shot and -- not a joke -- in less than 24 hours, I hit $100 just TESTING APPS. Yes, literally by clicking, playing, and exploring apps.

Here’s what happened (prepare to be as confused & wildly HYPED as I was):

- I found this resource: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**
- It looked so simple, I thought I’d be cursed with ads or scams. But NOPE. Legit apps ONLY.
- I followed the steps: SIGNED UP, picked some apps that looked fun/not sketchy, and BOOM. The first app paid me $7 for 15 minutes of feedback. I might be under-selling how bonkers this was.

At first I’m like: Is this a trap? Is my phone going to explode?  
But app after app kept PAYING. And it wasn’t cents—it was dollars.

- Second app: $14—literally for clicking around and sending a screenshot.
- Third: $22, this one wanted suggestions for improvement (yes, my review-ranting powers are finally for a reason).
- Couple more for $5-$20 each. All got tracked neatly in my panel on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

Who else knew about this and kept it a secret from me?? 😂

I literally made more chilling for half a day in pajamas than my old side-gig AT A REGISTER.  
Why am I spending money on coffee when I can just SPELLCHECK someone’s menu app for more than the price of an actual coffee? Make it make sense!!

HERE'S WHAT YOU DO:

- Hop on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**
- Sign-up (seriously takes less than 2 mins)
- Pick the apps you vibe with (don’t mess with sketch—this site checks them all)
- Give honest feedback (nothing fancy, just your real thoughts)
- Watch the dollars stack!!

No subscription. No hidden fees. NO credit card required. It’s honestly as shocking as it sounds.

Has anyone else stumbled onto this?? Will the easy side-cash gods strike us down if too many people use **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**? 😂

1mql62i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mql62i,Remember the great indoors?,"The Great Indoors was a chain of home decor and furniture stores operated by Sears, Roebuck and Co. (later Sears Holdings) from 1997 to 2012. Launched to capitalize on Sears' strength in hard goods and compete with upscale home retailers like Home Depot’s Expo Design Center, the concept targeted higher-income shoppers with stores averaging 100,000–150,000 square feet. Each store was organized into five sections—kitchen, bath, bedroom, great room, and flooring/walls—featuring brands like Bosch, Kenmore, KitchenAid, and Kohler, with around 50,000–80,000 products and up to 350,000 special-order items. Stores often included cafes, some branded as Starbucks or Dazbog Coffee, and accepted Sears credit cards but avoided Sears branding inside.The first store opened in Lone Tree, Colorado, on February 1, 1998, followed by a second in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 1999. At its peak in 2003, The Great Indoors had 21 stores across ten states, generating $550 million in sales with average transactions of $260 and $400 per square foot. Expansion was rapid, with 15 stores opened by 2001, including locations in Chicago, Houston, and Columbus, Ohio. However, the chain struggled with profitability. Sears closed three stores in 2003 (Arlington and Willowbrook, TX; Cincinnati, OH) and converted one in Shelby, MI, to a Sears Outlet, incurring a $75–100 million charge. The 2005 Sears-Kmart merger and the 2008 housing market crash further hurt sales, as fewer homes were remodeled. By 2011, three more stores closed, including both California locations.

————————————————————————

Marsh was still thinking about the events earlier that evening, replaying the sadness of the old woman as he sat at a desk in the station with Officer Collin and Hill. Their words were muffled to him for a long time as he stared off into space. The smudged glass windows of the office were draped over by shades and the concrete floor was cold from the night. Their lighting was dim, the room illuminated by a lamp on their desk and a faint lightbulb on the ceiling.

“So what did you find?” Collin asked. There wasn’t a response.

“Marsh? Marsh? Ay’ wake up sleepyhead!” Collin smacked Marsh on the back and Marsh snapped back to reality and jumped a bit in a daze.

“Huh, yes?”

“Are you awake now? Looked like you were sleeping with your eyes open.”

“Yeah, just thinking about stuff, y’know, got lost in thought for a second.”

“Well, did you hear what I asked?”

“No.” Officer Hill couldn’t help but snicker a bit at that and Collin sighed.

“What did you find out from his neighbors, you're a sleuth remember? A detective.”

“Oh, yes from what I heard from his neighbors he seemed to be into criminal activity. I think one of his neighbors said he was around a lot of drug dealers and criminals.” Collin nodded and shouldered Hill to take notes on a notepad he had on the desk.

“I see, you think he might’ve been involved in any gangs or criminal organizations?”

“Most likely, his neighbor had said he’d said he couldn’t leave the criminal world.”

“Probably means they thought he’d squeal about what they were doing if he left.” Hill piped up as he wrote.

“Could be,” Marsh said.

“There were signs of a break in at the crime scene, probably meaning there was a home intruder of some kind. Pretty normal in these Old World neighborhoods, especially this one.”

“Doubt it's a coincidence, you know how criminals are, they get under each other's skin, alliances break down, people do stuff for their own benefit, men squeal to rival gangs and betray their own.” Collin said.

“What do you mean?” Marsh asked.

“What I mean is that this guy, Rocko, might've upset the wrong people and he got kidnapped because of it. There was a handgun on the scene right, meaning there was a struggle of some sort, maybe the kid knew what was going to happen.”

“So it was a fellow gang member?” Hill asked.

“Likely, but that's not the hardest part of this case to figure out,”

“It’s figuring out where he’s at.” Marsh finished Collin’s sentence.

“Bingo Marsh, I ‘atta give you a gold star for that.”

“Thanks,” Marsh muttered.

“So do we have any contact with his family yet, any files on him before this?” Hill asked.

“Probably should look at that now that I think about it,” Marsh said.

“Here, I’ll go start a pot of coffee. Hill, you think you could go look for the file?” Collin asked.

“Sure,” Hill pushed his chair away from the desk and walked out the office, holding the door open for Collin before leaving Marsh alone to his thoughts. He pulled out the number the old woman had given him. Cases never usually got to him this bad, but something about the way that old woman cried, something about the way she hoped for him to be alright made Marsh feel like he had a duty to make sure Rocko was alive and well. But he couldn’t be too optimistic. Most of the time with the missing person’s cases like this he'd find men dead and buried beneath dirt or dissolved into flesh and bone, but he needed to just hold out a bit of hope that this kid was alright.

The sound of the door opening again made Marsh jump and he put the number of the old women in his pocket as Collin walked back in with a couple mugs in his hands.

“Dreaming?” He asked.

“Yeah, just dozing off y’know.” Collin was silent for a second and looked at Marsh.

“The bags under your eyes are horrible, Jesus.”

“Nothing a cup of joe can’t fix.” Marsh gave a weak smile. Collin seemed to be contemplating something and didn’t pick up on it.

“Marsh, you're fine to come and live with me at my place, I got an old guest bedroom you could sleep in, better than a cot.” Marsh looked at Collin. His brown eyes and the stubble on his face. Marsh shook his head.

“I’d be a burden Collin, plus with this case it’ll be a while before I see any sort of home at all.”

“I’m telling you Marsh, you're absolutely fine to stay with me, maybe I can help you find a better apartment too while you're there.” Marsh didn’t respond.

“Look, if you ever need to just come to my place even if it's out of the blue, I’ll take you in with open arms. Just know the offer will still be around for a while.” Marsh nodded.

“Thanks.” Before Collin could respond Hill walked back into the room with the file in his hands. He plopped it down on the desk and gave a nod toward Marsh. Collin set down the mugs and brought the pitcher of coffee in soon after and poured everyone some before going to put the pitcher back on the machine and returning to the room to watch as Marsh opened the file labeled, ‘Tyler Rocko Vincant’. Collin whistled out of surprise as he looked at the papers inside.

“Real piece of work huh?” Collin said. Below the section labeled ‘crimes’ there were a number of charges against Rocko. Handing out illegal substances, use of illegal substances, battery charges, and robbery. His mugshot showed a man with messy hair, and a mustache. His eyes told Marsh he was in another part of the world when they were taking this photo.

“We can confirm he was dealing stuff,” Hill said.

“And smoking his own supply.” Collin quipped.

“Look and see if we have any family members listed in there.” Marsh said.

“I’m looking.” Collin said. Collin flipped through the papers in the folder before reaching one with a list of phone numbers and addresses.

“Bingo,” he said. Collin handed the paper to Marsh.

“Go call the family members, tell them to come down here to the station.” Marsh nodded and walked out of the office toward the station’s only phone. He walked for a bit before reaching the secretary’s desk where a pile of papers was stacked on either side of it and an old rotary phone sat on it. The secretary had left a while ago for the night and that left the phone free for Marsh to use. He spun the wheel of the phone looking at the paper to see that he was putting in the right number, only for his finger to slip off the dial and it reset.

Marsh cursed a bit under his breath and went to dial the number again. It was a while off spinning the dial before he was actually able to hear the noise of the phone calling Rocko’s mother. Marsh stood for a while, listening to its beep, and almost thought it was a lost cause before he heard an old voice on the other end of the phone.

“Hello?”

“Hi ma'am, would this happen to be Marcy Vincant?”

“Yes, how come?”

“I’m with the police department in Burbank, your son Tyler-,”

“Does he need to be bailed out again? God that boy cannot go a month without a drug charge I swear-,”

“No, ma’am I can assure you it’s not that, we need you to come down to the station, better we explain it here, both you and your husband.

“We can be there in an hour, just tell me this, is he okay?”

“I can’t confirm or deny that at the moment ma’am, I’ll explain it when you get here.” Then Marsh hung up the phone. He felt bad hanging up so abruptly but he really couldn’t confirm if Rocko was okay or not. But with how cases like this usually went he was probably nothing more than a lost shadow. He walked back to the office where Collin and Hill were at.

“Said they’ll be here in an hour, gonna be really heavy ain’t it?”

“‘Fraid so Marsh, you know how worried people get when family goes missing, and they don’t even know yet. You wanna sit out on this one, talking with the family?” Collin asked.

“No. Better I meet them and they know I’ll be trying as hard as I can to find their son, give them a bit of faith he’s okay.”

“If you say so, just know it’s gonna be a long night.”

“I’ve worked longer,” Collin chuckled a bit at that and Hill let a smile slip. It lightened the mood a bit, but only for a brief bit, a bit that would dissipate as soon as it appeared like a puff of smoke.

“I’m gonna go look at this file a bit more, you two wait here I guess.” Hill said. Marsh nodded and watched as Hill walked out of the room.

“There was something I noticed about that file,” Collin said.

“What do you mean?” Marsh asked.

“Apparently he’s got an job office out in New Mesa,”

“And?”

“And that office I think I’ve heard their name before, it was called Wilson Mechanics from what I saw.” The name certainly rang a bell for Marsh, but he couldn’t place where. Maybe he saw them on the news or in the paper. He couldn’t remember.

“I might've heard that name before too. Think it means anything to this case?”

“I don’t know, it seems familiar, maybe I’m overthinking things but I’ve seen that name before I know I have. But my main question is how did he work for a mechanics company?”

“Maybe it was a car mechanic company?”

“No I don’t think that’s it, I swear they made products of their own.”

“Well, whatever it is I’d write it down, could be a lead.”

“That is true.”

“The parents could give us some answers, maybe they know something about it.”

“Hopefully they can, just something about that name, just something…” The two sat in silence for a long while after that. It was broken when Marsh heard the door of the station open.

“Guess it’s time,” Collin sighed. Marsh and Collin left the office and made their way to the front of the station and found two people waiting for them.

  *	  *	 *

Marcy and her husband sat in waiting. A faint light bulb hung from the ceiling, cloaking the room in an all encompassing shadow of dread and misery for all within it. Marcy was an older looking woman, her face was wrinkled and her hair was a tangle of gray and black. The faintness of tear marks could be seen below her slightly red eyes. Her husband wore a beard of gray with wrinkles that looked like ancient carvings. He wore a pair of reading glasses around his neck, and had hair that only seemed to poke out on the sides of his head, leaving a large bald spot on the center of his scalp. 

Finally, Marsh and Collin returned to the room and pulled up two chairs to the table to meet with them face to face. Collin handed a notepad and pen to Marsh, then looked at Marcy. He had a hard time getting out his words.

“Ma’am, your son, his house was broken into earlier tonight. There were signs of a struggle, and it appears he’s gone.”

“What do you mean gone?” She asked.

“He was missing from the premises when police arrived, and we think he might’ve been taken by someone. We think he might have been into criminal activity including interacting with gangs of criminals from what we found in his file.” Collin pulled out the file from his coat and slid it across the table for the two to see.

“Can you testify to that?” 

The two were silent for a long time, Marcy beginning to quietly sob and placing her head into her hands. 

Her husband, Tom, was the first to speak, “I’m…I’m afraid so yes,”

“How long would you say he’s been this way?”

“Well, ever since his last year of school he started to act out,”

“How so?”

“He started to show up past his curfew, always late at night. At first we brushed it off, maybe he was working later, maybe he just had a hard time with traffic. But then it became common for him, he’d start showing up late again and again, sometimes at one in the morning with school the next day. We punished him but that didn’t seem to do much, he’d either sneak out or do it again.”

“Was he ever intoxicated in any way?”

“Not at first, but then he started to show up high, his eyes would be red and veiny, his clothes would smell of smoke and skunk.”

“Did he graduate?”

“He did yes, he managed to pass all his classes even with all this going on. He even got accepted into a trade school for engineering. We were proud of him but we still knew he had a problem, one that needed to be addressed.”

“How did you go about it?”

“We sat him down one night and talked with him, he started to get real defensive, telling us it was his life and we should stay out of it, but we didn’t. So we told him if he did it again we’d kick him out. He did it again.”

“Did he have problems after you kicked him out?”

“Too many to list, he started selling drugs, he got caught using them, and he even tried to rob a convenience store. Beat the clerk to near death! But we always bailed him out because he told us he would change for the better, but he never did. That last incident was our final straw with him, we didn’t bail him out that time. He got out recently and that was the last we heard from him.”

“Did he have a job by chance?”

“He did and somehow he kept it, some office job out in New Mesa working for Wilson Mechanics.”

“Do you happen to know that name by chance?”

“I’m familiar with it, they make appliances, I think they also work in the repairman business too.”

“Did he ever mention it much?”

“No, we’d ask him about it and he’d say it was boring paperwork and tinkering, that was it.”

“Is there anything else you’d like to mention about your son?” The pair were silent, Marcy sniffed and wiped the tears from her eyes and Tom shook his head. Collin looked over to Marsh and tapped him on the shoulder, his head raising from his notepad.

“This man right here is detective Marsh, he’ll be the one trying to find your son.” Marsh stood up and placed the notepad on the table.

“Sir, Ma’am, I assure you I will do my best to find your son, even if I risk my life in the process I will return him to you, he’s another human being and I won’t allow him to be another number added to the ever growing list of missing people around here. I won’t allow him to be another statistic.” He reached his hand out to Tom who shook his hand firmly and nodded, he did the same for Marcy who pulled him into a hug. Her tears streamed down her face and stained Marsh’s coat.

“Please find my son, please find him.”

“I will.” Marsh said, “I will.”

Marcy released him from her grasp and Collin opened the door to the room and gestured toward it.

“Will make sure to keep in contact with you both.” Collin said. The two didn’t respond, instead Tom pulled his wife closer to him as they made their way out and helped her to the parking lot.

Collin looked at Marsh, “What did you get written down?”

“The company, his past, most of the stuff they talked about.”

“‘Least we know now that name is related to something, but there's another question I have: Marsh,”

“What is it?”

“If he’s working for a mechanics company, why is he involved with criminals, I’m pretty sure those jobs pay well enough.”

“Side-hustle?”

“Maybe. Marsh, I'm gonna have you go out and look at that office to see if you can find anything while you're there.”

“What could I even find?”

“Evidence Marsh, evidence.”

“Right, so should I head there now?”

“They’re probably closed right now. I’d suggest you go there tomorrow afternoon, get some rest first, we have a long case ahead of us.”

“I’ll try. Goodnight Collin.”

“Goodnight Marsh.” With that Marsh left the station for the night. He made his way up the concrete sidewalk to his apartment building and eventually arrived. He made his way into the lobby, and made his way to the old worn down lift. He pressed the button and heard it screech its way down the shaft. He got on it and clicked on his floor, the door snapping shut and sending him up. 

When he finally arrived at his apartment he sighed. He hung up his holster, his coat, and his hat, and changed into some night time clothes. Finally he laid down on the roughness that was his bed and looked at the ceiling above him. He could only think about Rocko’s loved ones. He could see how upset his parents were even with their strained relationship with him they still weep for him. Marsh had a feeling he could find him, somehow, someway he could. But then a doubt crept into Marsh’s mind, one he was all too familiar with. He’d felt it in previous missing persons cases, and had to come to terms with it a multitude of times, that the person very well may have fallen off the face of the Earth, and was impossible to find now. Marsh rolled over to look at his desk now. It was something he just had to hope wouldn’t happen with Rocko or he too would become one of many ghosts that kept Marsh up at night.

*	 * 	 *

Marsh heard the sounds of rain pounding the roof as he laid in his cot, sleepless as usual. He tried to will himself all night but couldn’t manage to at all. He sighed as he got up and got ready for the day. He threw on a white button up shirt with some old brown trousers. He grabbed his trench coat and hat, then his holster for his revolver. He grabbed a notepad from his desk drawer and a pen. He shoved them in the pocket of his coat and opened the door. He locked it behind him and made his way to the old worn down lift. He hit the button down to the lobby and watched his floor disappear from view.

He emerged in the lobby of the apartment building and made his way out the door. The rain hit him hard. He felt himself get soaked in a matter of minutes by how much was pouring down. Didn’t help the wind seemed to shove into his face too. The sky above him was a seedy gray that only served to make the Old World town look worse. He walked down the street, contending with the rain and made it to the station. He entered the building and slammed the door behind him, the sounds of the rain echoing throughout the building. He looked over at the receptionist desk where the chirpy lady herself sat.

“Morning Jess,” Marsh said to her.

“Morning Marsh, rough morning huh?” She looked at his soaked coat to which Marsh smiled and nodded a bit. He made his way past her desk and Jess got back to a piece of paper on her desk. Marsh walked past other offices and cubicles before reaching Collin’s office. He looked inside and saw him leaned back in his chair sleeping, his feet on the desk. Marsh knocked on the glass, and Collin jumped, nearly falling out of his chair onto the floor before steadying himself. He looked over at Marsh and said he couldn’t make out. Marsh went to the door and opened it.

“Looks like I’m not the only sleepless one.”

“Yeah well I didn’t expect you so early, I did say afternoon right?” Collin asked.

“Couldn’t sleep, might as well get it over with while I’m awake,”

Collin sighed a bit, “If you're so eager,” He threw Marsh a keyring that almost slipped entirely from his hands.

“Don’t go dozing off behind the wheel, those cars are expensive.”

“Won’t make any promises.” Marsh said. He walked away from Collin’s office past an old storage room before reaching a backdoor he walked out of. He made his way through the parking lot filled with multiple police cars before finding the one the key went to. He threw himself inside the automobile and threw his coat, hat, and revolver to the driver side. He placed the key in the ignition and started the car. He backed out of the parking lot before making his way to the road where he took a right, past his apartment building and past multiple old homes and businesses. He had one destination on his mind right then. That place was New Mesa.",1,1755225317.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I want to wall mount my 43 inch tv in my bedroom. It has to go in this position. I'm dealing with a swinging door to the left and a closet on the right 

1. Do I want a fixed, tilting, or full motion mount?

Argument for fixed - could be low profile enough that swinging door can clear it. Cheaper. Would stay level.

Tilting - do I need this? Follow-up question: how high do you mount a tv in a bedroom? See below.

Full motion - would this help me push the tv over to have the door clear or would this stick out so much that the door may not clear

2. Studs

I want to hang this as close as I can to the closet on the right. I see some single stud mounts out there. Should I stay away from them because the centre of the mount would have to go on one stud? If I get one that has multiple holes for the studs, do I need to mount those on two studs? I have used a stud finder and it isn't very consisent, so it's making it hard to plan this out

3. Height

The tv is on a low coffee table right now. It's at eye level but when my cat comes on my lap, I can't see it. I know I would mount higher but how high is best? Do I need a tilting tv mount to accommodate the different positions you can be in in bed watching TV? 

4. What else

What am I not considering?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **WTA Cincinnati Open: Iga Swiatek vs. Anna Kalinskaya – A Matchup of Titans and Underdogs**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a tennis showdown that’s as lopsided as a disco ball in a library. On one side: **Iga Swiatek**, the Polish powerhouse who’s turned hard courts into her personal playground. On the other: **Anna Kalinskaya**, the Russian wild card with a serve like a roulette wheel—unpredictable, but never boring. Let’s break this down with the precision of a line judge and the humor of a post-match interview gone rogue.

---

### Parse the Odds: When the Books Speak Louder Than a Crowd

The odds here are about as subtle as a tennis ball bouncing on a tin can. Across all bookmakers, **Swiatek is a near 85% favorite** (decimal odds \~1.17-1.19), while Kalinskaya sits at **17-19%** (odds of 4.8-5.25). To put that in perspective, Swiatek’s chances of winning are roughly the same as a coffee addict surviving a caffeine IV drip. Kalinskaya’s odds? About the same as me napping through a lecture on quantum physics without snoring once.

The spreads and totals also tell a story. Swiatek is giving **5-5.5 games** in most markets, meaning bookmakers expect her to cruise to a 6-2, 6-3 victory. The over/under for games is pegged at **19.5-20**, suggesting a moderately paced match—nothing like a Grand Slam final, but not a nap, either.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Form, and Why Kalinskaya’s Still Standing

Let’s start with **Swiatek**, the 23-time WTA title holder who’s currently riding a **35-match winning streak** on clay (as of 2023). She’s the kind of player who makes “dominance” sound like a casual weekend hobby. Recent reports confirm she’s **100% healthy**, with no signs of her infamous “mental fatigue” (a problem solved by, you know, *winning*). Her game is a masterclass in consistency—think of her as a Tesla on autopilot: sleek, efficient, and slightly terrifying to anyone in he

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and functionality of a chest often depend on its specific features. this section examines the crucial aspects to consider before making a purchase.

**Material Durability:**
The material used in the construction of a chest considerably impacts its durability and longevity. Wooden chests, especially those made from hardwoods like oak or cedar, are known for their strength and resistance to wear and tear. Metal chests,often constructed from steel or aluminum,offer exceptional robustness and are ideal for heavy-duty storage. Plastic chests, typically made from polyethylene or polypropylene, provide weather resistance and are suitable for outdoor use, but may not offer the same level of durability as wood or metal.

**Storage Capacity:**
The internal volume of a chest determines the amount of items it can accommodate. Storage capacity is generally measured in cubic feet or gallons. Consider the types of items you plan to store and their dimensions to estimate the required capacity. Small chests, ranging from 5 to 10 cubic feet, are suitable for storing blankets, pillows, or smaller tools. Medium-sized chests, ranging from 10 to 20 cubic feet, can handle larger items like sports equipment or gardening supplies. Large chests,exceeding 20 cubic feet,are ideal for storing bulky items such as holiday decorations or camping gear.

**Locking Mechanisms:**

Consider chests with robust locking mechanisms, such as keyed locks, combination locks, or padlock-compatible hasps.Keyed locks offer a traditional and reliable form of security, while combination locks eliminate the need for physical keys. Padlock-compatible hasps allow you to use your own padlock for added security customized security. The quality of the lock hardware and the strength of the surrounding material are also important considerations.

**Weather resistance:**
If you plan to use the chest outdoors or in a damp environment, weather resistance is essential. Look for chests constructed from waterproof or water-resistant materials,such as plastic or treated wood. Features like tight-fitting lids and sealed seams can further enhance weather protection, preventing moisture, dust, and pests from entering the chest. UV resistance is also important for chests exposed to direct sunlight, as it prevents fading and degradation of the material over time.

**Aesthetic Design:**
Chests are not just functional storage solutions; they can also serve as decorative elements in your home. Choose a chest with an aesthetic design that complements your existing décor. Wooden chests are available in various finishes, from rustic to contemporary, allowing you to match your personal style.

# Best Long Burning Candles 2025: Top Picks for You

Candles have long been a staple in homes,providing not just light but also ambiance,fragrance,and a sense of calm. Though, the frustration of candles burning out quickly is a common pain point. Long matches are the unsung heroes that bridge the gap between lighting a candle and enjoying its extended burn time.These extended matches offer both safety and convenience, allowing you to reach deep into jars and safely ignite wicks without the risk of burning your fingers.In 2025, the market offers a variety of long matches designed for specific purposes and aesthetics, and this article aims to guide you through the top contenders.

## Key Features Analysis

The best long matches for candles are more than just elongated versions of their shorter counterparts. They incorporate features that enhance safety, convenience, and even aesthetic appeal.

**Match Length:** The length is a critical factor. Matches ranging from 4 to 12 inches provide the necessary reach for various candle sizes, especially those housed in deep jars or lanterns.

The Ideal length depends on the candle types you use. Shorter long matches, around 4 inches, may suffice for votives and small jars. However, for larger, deeper containers, a 7-inch or longer match is recommended to prevent burns and ensure easy lighting.Some manufacturers even offer extra-long matches exceeding 10 inches for fireplaces or larger candles.

**Material & Construction:** The quality of the matchstick and the striking surface directly impacts the ease and reliability of ignition.High-quality matches typically use wood from lasting sources, such as Aspen or Pine, for their even and clean burn. The match head composition is another crucial aspect, as premium formulations ignite quickly and consistently without sputtering or excessive smoke. The striking surface needs to be abrasive enough to ignite the match head easily but not so aggressive that it damages the matchstick.

**Packaging & Presentation:** How the matches are packaged influences their storage, accessibility, and overall aesthetic appeal.

Many long matches come in decorative glass or cardboard containers, which not only protect the matches but also add a touch of elegance to your candle display.Some manufacturers offer matches in refillable containers, promoting sustainability and reducing waste. Clear packaging allows you to easily see the remaining match count, while airtight containers help protect the matches from moisture and ensure they are always ready for use.**Safety Features:** Given the extended length, safety is paramount. features like a slow burn rate and a stable flame are essential.

Opt for matches that are treated to burn at a moderate pace, giving you ample time to light the candle without rushing. A stable flame that doesn't flicker excessively is also crucial, as it reduces the risk of accidental burns or dropped matches. Some high-end matches even incorporate safety coatings that prevent the flame from traveling down the matchstick too quickly.

**Aesthetics & Design:** Beyond functionality, the design of the matches and their packaging contributes to the overall sensory experience of candle lighting.

Long matches now come in various colors, complementing different candle styles and home décor. Some manufacturers offer matches with colored tips or even custom-printed designs on the matchstick or packaging.Decorative glass jars,wooden boxes,and minimalist cardboard containers provide a range of aesthetic options to suit your personal taste.**Striking Surface Quality:** The quality of the striking surface is pivotal for reliable and easy ignition.

A well-made striking surface will ignite the match with minimal effort. Low-quality striking surfaces may require multiple attempts,potentially damaging the match head or causing frustration. Premium long matches use a durable and effective striking compound that ensures a consistent and safe ignition every time. The placement of the striking surface, whether on the container or as a separate pad, is also a design consideration.

## Core Benefits

Long matches offer several practical benefits that enhance the candle-lighting experience, making them a worthwhile addition for any candle enthusiast.

The Added reach eliminates the need to tilt or angle the candle awkwardly, preventing hot wax from splashing. the longer matchstick also provides better visibility, allowing you to position the flame precisely on the wick without risking accidental contact with the candle container.

**Improved Convenience:** Lighting candles becomes substantially easier,especially those that are difficult to reach or nestled within decorative arrangements. The long match offers the necessary clearance to maneuver in tight spaces effortlessly.This eliminates the need for extra tools like lighters with extended nozzles or barbecue lighters, streamlining the candle-lighting process. The ability to light multiple candles in quick succession also enhances convenience,allowing you to achieve your desired ambiance quickly and efficiently.

**Elegant Presentation:** Long matches often come in visually appealing packaging, adding a touch of sophistication to your candle display. These stylish containers can complement your home décor and elevate the overall aesthetic.

Glass Jars, wooden boxes, and minimalist designs can enhance the visual appeal of your candle collection. Some long matches even serve as decorative elements themselves, adding a touch of elegance to your coffee table or mantelpiece. High-quality matches and their packaging reflect a commitment to quality and attention to detail, signaling discerning taste.

**Extended Burn Time:** By reducing the risk of wax spillage and ensuring proper wick ignition, long matches contribute to a more consistent and even burn, potentially prolonging the life of your candles.

A Proper ignition allows the candle wax to melt uniformly,preventing tunneling or uneven burning. This results in a more efficient use of the wax and fragrance,maximizing the enjoyment of your candles. By minimizing the chances of having to relight the candle due to improper ignition, you also reduce the wear and tear on the wick, preserving its integrity over time.
