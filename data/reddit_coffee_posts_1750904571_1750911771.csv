1lkqtq7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lkqtq7,Relocate kitchen or not?,"everyone, 

We've recently bought a house and asked designer for some options on the floorplan. 

A bit about our family, we have 2 young kids, and frequent guest visits.

Our priorities are 

1) easy access to kids bedroom
2) laundry inside the house
3) complete guest room w easy access to bathroom 
4) a study area/room. We also want to do a full house renovations, new kitchen etc. 

The current floor plan has the potential to meet our needs and designer provided 2 options of which one needs to relocate the kitchen (currently middle of the house) to the back corner next to garage w window access..

Pro of relocate kitchen: better from activity flow and kitchen next to garage w/ window and door to yard, and resale potential in the future? Ensuite guest room.

My primary concern with this plan is that the guest room would be close to master bedroom and also study area has no window access. No distinct dining room. And less storage for kids bedroom. 

How would you choose the floorplan? How important is kitchen w window for resale value? We are in a relative hot real estate market . Since the renovation will be costly, we want to make sure it's adding value to house, I'm leaning toward option 1 not relocating kitchen but worried about future house resales value.

We plan to stay here for 10-15years.

See picture of existing floor plan, option 1 keep major layout as is 2) relocate kitchen plan a and plan b

For example: I love smelling like coffee, sugar cookies, baked goods, cozy vanilla.
But I also love smoke, dirt, grass, patchouli, foresty vibes.

Like ideally I‚Äôd love to smell like a spooky witch that owns a bakery in the middle of a haunted woods but idk how realistic that is.

I‚Äôm not well versed in perfumes. My go to scents before were the KVD saint and sinner. 
I have a bunch of the Ariana grande perfumes but they have like zero lasting power. 
My friend showed my givenchy ange au demon the white and black bottle and I really like that from what I remember.

My current perfume idea list is:
Billie eilish 1
Black opium
Mugler alien
Commodity velvet (I can‚Äôt find it tho)
Commodity - book, paper, milk, gold

1lkqpp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_rhythmyr/comments/1lkqpp1/testimonial_of_testing_and_reliance/,Testimonial of testing and reliance,"TestimonialHi ya'll, okay so I am going to tell you a bit about what has been happening with me for awhile, and it might sound crazy to you, but if so that's okay.  It's still true, just full of miracles.  This has a lot to do with the introduction of sativa marijuana into my life, so I will start there.  When I was young, about the age of 14 or 15 I tried marijuana for the first time.  It was always the indica variety though.  There are two main strains, one is called indica, the other sativa.  The indica is for numbing pain, being sedated, being stoned.  The sativa does so much more, but I didn't know about it.  I was never told about it.  I believe I tried it once after my brain injury and was so surprised by it that I didn't try it again.  It has proven to have incredible effects on the way my brain functions, and I am so sure about it that I have no trouble writing this and standing by it, prepared to defend its use on any level, of health, of brain, of thinking, creativity, energy, strength, focus.When I returned to the small town where I live in 2014 I had been smoking a whole lot of the indica variety, and in 2011 had begun to hear voices for the first time in my life.  Hearing voices is usually associated with schizophrenia, and I was aware of that, having been told so by someone and how it may relate to my marijuana usage.  I kept that in mind, and endured the assault on my mind of these voices that kept saying stupid things, attacks on me that were easy enough to deny.  I just kept this to myself, having mentioned it to my girlfriend at the time and was met with compassion.  I was surprised.  When I returned to this town I stopped the marijuana usage completely, for 10 years.  The voices did not stop though.  I began to accept them as part of my daily life, and just endured.  They actually helped me get closer to God, as they caused things to come up in me, by way of reaction to them, that exposed my need for Him to be intervening.  Despite me having many times of being made aware of those things, and being brought into a relationship of constant repentance with God (where He is always bringing me to see the wrong that I have done, even when I don't necessarily see it in the moment), I still am a brain injury survivor and am constantly forgetting things in the moment, even that just happened.  It's been getting worse over the years and I could tell, because if a TBI survivor can be anything, it's introspective.  So I was able to tell that my mental state was declining.  It was affecting my spiritual life and progress.  How did it look to have a brain like mine?Well, I would wake up like an automoton, get up, have my coffee, drink my breakfast smoothie made the day before, go to work, and do my landscaping duties that amounted to yardwork for gracious people kind enough to give me the work.  I have loved all my clients in one way or another.  With my social difficulties due to memory, information retention, and the lack of common element in my thought process, they've been my friends over the years.  Anyway, so I would do my work, but what about the conversations I would have even with clients?  Well, I would be blanking out all the time, I would have to get them to repeat themselves either because something they had said had got me thinking of something else and I forgot they were talking, or I just mysteriously blanked out like my brain got overloaded, or I forgot what they said.  They got used to it; it was the brain injury.  I talked about it often.  I began to wonder if I was kind of looked down on a little for it, but I just felt helpless to contribute more than I was.  I would never have much to say either.  Not much to respond to for most of the time.  It amounted to polite, friendly conversation, but I couldn't even know how to relate to people if I even wanted to, so I wouldn't try.  My mind was dead.  So slow.  I could perform my functions because I had done them a hundred million times, but try to engage in conversation and I was done for.  Nothing to say.  I know what kind of image I was presenting to people and there was nothing I could do about it.  I just began to pray more and more.  In all my difficulties, I was always thinking of the woman I had left when I left the larger city that I had been in from 2010-2014, and was praying for her.  God gave me an image in my mind of her so happy, joyful, full of the light of Christ and His love too.  I had loved her so much but because it was in a time when I was foolishly trying to rebel against God, and find a comparable love in the world, I was always coming up against my limitations in regard to that and He was always bringing me to conviction about things.  I tried to ignore it by smoking immense amounts of indica marijuana, as well as do other drugs, and party, and we had fun times together, but it was always lacking true joy.  True freedom.  I was always convicted about it.  She has the most beautiful teeth and eyes of any woman I have ever met, and when she smiles, it's the best thing I could ever see.  To see that face with joy, as God showed me, it's just priceless, as she is.  I could always see how much she could help me, and even in our fleshliness, walking in self-reliance, she was a big help to me and I helped her too.  There were just so many limitations because of our weak, sinful, human flesh.  I was also oppressed by thoughts of how I was not worthy to be with her, because of how inept, how dysfunctional my brain was, and how I would only hold her back.  Still, once I met her I have been on a steady journey to get to the place where I want no other woman but her and I never will, and so I had been praying for her, as well as seeking God to make me into the man who would be the right husband for the image of her being free in Him that He had given me.  There were a great many changes made to me over that decade of not smoking marijuana.  These changes resulted in me being able to run a yard work business, not much but it's something, have good relationships with my clients, live comfortably, becoming free of lust to the place now where I gladly make it a practice to not look at womans bodies unless it's a full shot where I am not looking at body parts, just seeing the person, looking for their eyes, etc.  This is something God was doing long before I tried the sativa.  Yet I still struggled with my mental function.  The way my brain worked.  I would always hit blocks, lose what I was thinking about while I was thinking it.  I couldn't focus, couldn't remember things, couldn't follow a constructive thought pattern.  I was just doing the same thing over and over again for years, eat, sleep, work and the occasional dinner and movie with a friend.  Just praying for God to make me the man I needed to be for Him and for Carly, as I was just abandoning myself and my doubts to Him, laying them at His feet, trusting in Him faithfully about her.  I was always praying for her protection as well, though I didn't know why because I had a great sense that God had been protecting her for a long time.  As my brain function was so limited, and had been degenerating, these prayers were very much of the childlike faith variety.  So then I started to work on a project for her to express my love to her, and this was beginning to change my life.  I made a harmonic playlist on spotify that when you listen to it with the crossfader function turned on and set to 7 seconds it sounds considerably like a big 64 hr dj mix and I believe describes some things to her about where I was, why I left the way I did, and what I desire, which is the amazing miracle of Christ's love binding us together in marriage and having us experience a love we don't deserve.  Just using mostly secular music with lyrics that when combined, tell a story of Christ-like love in humility.  The reason I did it this way is because I wanted to reach her in a way that she would be open to hearing even if she wasn't open to hearing about God right away.  It was my zeal after leaving to come back here that made her scared to talk with me after that.  I wanted to be more gentle about describing why, and what I meant, that she would know how much I love her.  I really believe that God enabled me to do that in that way.  I could describe it.  I did describe it to her in a message.    I got to the end of it and was having trouble finishing it.  The end of the big section I was working on, which is currently the end of where it is as well.  I even left it for days, going back to try and see but not finding the next song.  I saw something in an email mentioning the benefits of sativa for the mind, and began to read up about it, and was amazed.  This stuff would actually be good for a brain injury, if it could have these effects that I was learning about.  So I tried it.  It's like a switch went on in my brain, and one of the first big epiphane I had was that I had been carrying around anxiety for a long time, mental anxiety due to what I had been experiencing, and it was affecting my thought process.  Every attack I had experienced had made me want to recede even more, and just hide.  Suddenly I was able to see that, and also realize that I wasn't feeling that anxiety anymore.  It was like a weight had been lifted off of my mind, and I was just thinking clearly all of the sudden, following thought processes, actually being able to think things through without losing my train of thought, and ultimately feeling more and more confident about what was happening.  It was like mental relaxation, while not dulling or dumbing.  I began to see the symptoms of my brain injury more readily and easily as well.  I started to become aware of when I was losing focus, or when I forgot something.  Before I tried the sativa, I wouldn't be aware of when I lost my train of thought until I had travelled down a path far enough and for long enough that I suddenly snapped out of it, knowing that I had been thinking of something else that was important, but couldn't remember what that was for the life of me.  So now that I have been becoming aware of when I forget things, it's easier to focus on that and retrieve them.  This almost always happens through prayer.  Asking God to bring it back for me.  He is worthy to do something with even a pathetic man like me.  So over the last year, since having bought some for the first time in 10 years, I have been experiencing many changes in my brain function.  This has also led to me relying on God more, because the more things change, the more I know I need to rely on Him.  I have become a man of almost constant prayer.  This has also led to me having memories come back of things, and I know they are memories, they have all the things required for them to be memories.  This has also had me trusting in God while He led me to share these memories that I would swear by under oath, knowing what it could mean for me if they aren't true, but being certain they are.  This has led to me realizing why God would have me do it that way, because they can only be refuted by proving they aren't true, and I know they are, so this means things get done and can't be squelched by those who have money, power, connections, and influence.  I didn't realize this until after God got me to share those memories without hatred, anger, a desire for vengeance, or anything like that.  Just for the truth to be known.  I know that people close to me, without even being able to ask me one single question that would have brought this story out of me, or even were willing to listen to me long enough for me to tell it without interrupting me and telling me they had heard enough, have judged this as not being something that God would do, and that even though they have basically been shut out of my life for months at their own action, they seem to know that this has been bad for me.  I see God miraculously using something He has created for His glory.  I don't need it, but then I really struggle so much more with my mental function when I am not being helped by the stuff.  Why would God create something so miraculous in how it can help someone like me and others, and then say ""Okay, yeah I know I created it, but man has fallen, the world has entered into sin, so now this just belongs to satan.  It's all his.""  He wouldn't.  He can use all sorts of things for His glory.  We need to be sensitive to look for the fruit.  Now I am being rebuked by people who are children of God but who are judging me, as I said, without having given me the opportunity to defend myself or tell the full story, so it's not really a valid rebuke if they don't understand everything, but I really believe God has been using this for His glory.  Do you think I am proud in this?  Not a chance.  I am thanking God for His blessing.  I am thanking God for providing something miraculous by His grace that has helped me with simple mental function that I thought I was doomed to just degrade with for the rest of my life.  What a pathetic life I have [led.Now](http://led.Now), I don't think I am being led to be reliant on the stuff, nor is the only way to ingest it being by smoking, but another sign of His blessing is that as I am smoking it, He is leading me to pray fervently.  This is not in a pentecostal way, but just with great earnestness, and He is showing me things, enabling me to do great things like travelling a long distance along a rocky boulder filled creek and through a forest with a heavy bag of collected rocks on my back day after day after day without hardly breaking a sweat and never getting out of breath.  No signs of bad lung health at all, and I am in my 40s.  My body has never worked better.  I weigh what I did when I was a teen, solid muscle though lean, and I have energy for days.  God somehow gets me sleeping at night though I don't know how.  My landscaping is drying up.  I was able to eek a comfortable living using the self-employment program through disability to exempt my business expenses from my income that I had to claim, but they somehow kicked me off of that, and I was never charging enough to actually make a living from it.  Things are so expensive, and unless you have a crew and the business to warrant it, it's too expensive to run in this economy.  I am basically just doing the bare minimum, not knowing how I would survive.  Just with a sense of responsibility, out of integrity, and then I go gather rocks until sundown.  Three of my biggest clients, ones who tried to introduce me to pedophilia, dropped me mysteriously this year.  There's no way I could live off this anymore.  God is in control though.  I know that before this last year of what I believe has been healing and transformation, I would not be able to handle what I am being faced with.  I still know that I can't handle it, but I know that I trust in God, and He is worthy.  That has been the point of all of this.  To show me just how much I need to rely on Him in all things, look to be doing all things for His glory, be relying on Him to make that happen, to lead me in repentance, that loving relationship, and to make me humble, for that is the safest place to be.  Where He shows His strength when I am weak.  I will always be a weak man, but God is strong, and may be making me ready to be strong in Him as I trust Him to be who He wills for me to be, for whom He wills for me to be that for.  If you want to ask me questions, make comments, whatever, feel free.  I will respond if I can.",1,1750911221.0,u_rhythmyr,0,1.0,False

She even went as far as to get me checked out of the infirmary when I could stand and move. So I did what I thought was best and left it alone. Now I'm sitting at a table on the southern beach with that folder Lu gave me.

Gently popping the metal tab off the edge of the folder and opening it, I was greeted with a whole bunch of medical jargon and dates that barely made sense to me. The only thing I could understand was my name alongside Dad's and Dai Lu's. And a note clearly in Lu's handwriting‚Ä¶

‚ÄòI know this may come as either shock or surprise‚Ä¶ You were always there for me even though I wasn't always for you. I've lived my life searching for the man who helped create me and had no luck. Not even divination could show me my desired path. It truly hurts me to have kept this from you for three weeks. From right before you left I had come across medical information that filled my heart with joy, but also worry.‚Äô 

I had to take a moment to think. What could cause Lu to worry? This was already a weird thing to deal with, but if it was really important then why not just tell me? I need to keep reading‚Ä¶

‚ÄòPlease do not be mad for the actions your father took before you were conceived and please forgive him for not saying anything. The truth is that we‚Ä¶ You and I are half-siblings‚Ä¶ Sisters‚Ä¶ From Our Father‚Ä¶ The same one who taught me things and showed me how to make my life happier.

My hands trembled as I took in what I just read. This whole time growing up Dai Lu has been my sister? Why would dad keep this from me? And did mom know too? Today Is going to be long‚Ä¶ And speak of the devil‚Ä¶ she may be quiet but I can sense her‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHey there sweetheart, you okay?‚Äù Mom asked, sitting down without making a sound. 


‚ÄúDid you know?‚Äù I asked, still holding the note.

Mom placed her hands on the table and fidgeted with her wedding band before she finally took a breath.

‚ÄúNo, not at first but when I first laid eyes on Harbin and Dai Lu in her arms, there was no mistaking it. At first I was mad that he didn't tell me he had a relationship before he met me, but by then I found out I was pregnant with you. But with everything you had wrong when you were born I forgot about it and focused on making sure you stayed healthy.‚Äù Mom paused and pulled out her phone and started scrolling through old pictures. ‚ÄúDon't worry, I made sure to punish your dad and Harbin a couple days ago.‚Äù


‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù I asked, just slightly worried. 

Mom set her phone down and stopped on a picture of her naked, with Dad and Harbin tied up on the bed, mom's hands covering up dad's lower bits.

‚ÄúDrained him for everything that he had, then let Harbin get wrecked by him while I took a break‚Äù Mom chuckled. ‚ÄúI decided that if we both get pregnant again it'll mend everything and give you and Dai Lu a chance to be the best big sister's on base!‚Äù

‚ÄúW-What? Another kid? But I thought you said you couldn't?‚Äù I started to get confused while I spoke.

I remember mom saying that Another kid would hurt her body, but‚Ä¶ agh! Why is this so confusing to me!

‚ÄúI'm shocked that you're not upset about me and your father having sex with Harbin.‚Äù Mom spoke with a sarcastically sick tone.


‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I have a lot more on my plate mom‚Ä¶‚Äù I said as Zero appeared on the other side of the table.

Mom almost instantly jumped back and summoned her rigging and pushed me to the ground. 

‚ÄúSiren! Get down Natalie!‚Äù Mom shouted.

Zero unknowingly copied my movements from Mom pushing me down and covered her head.

‚ÄúCabot, control your lifegiver I mean no harm.‚Äù Zero spoke softly. 

I acted quickly and crawled to the other side of the table and popped up blocking mom from doing anything too hasty.

‚ÄúMom please calm down!‚Äù I held up my hands and moved back. ‚ÄúZero is the reason I'm not dead! The reason I took on a Siren and brought back Miss Rossi, and saved Mason!‚Äù

The look on mom's face made me wish I could do something more than bodyblock her. I've never seen her so on edge.

‚ÄúOur Zero's‚Ä¶ in hiding,  and she wasn't nice and helpful‚Ä¶‚Äù mom rolled up her left sleeve. ‚ÄúShe hurt a lot of us and took Hornet away from us‚Ä¶ so why should I trust this one?‚Äù


‚ÄúBecause she was stuck and abandoned like Rossi was, and she's trying to help me, help us!‚Äù I answered as I summoned my own rigging. 


‚ÄúFine then Natalie, prove it to me and let's see how much a Siren can help you‚Ä¶‚Äù Mom grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the water. ‚ÄúYou against me, if you win I'll drop it and never say another word, but if you so much as stutter or hesitate I'll make the Commander remove her from your head. Do you understand me?‚Äù

As soon as my feet hit the water I spun around as the sounds of planes filled the air.

‚ÄúFine‚Ä¶ I faced my nightmares more than you've faced yours‚Ä¶ Zero is more helpful than anything I've tried before.‚Äù I summoned a flight of Hellcats and made some space between us. ‚ÄúI'm going to beat you‚Ä¶‚Äù

XXXVVVXXX 

Mason sat up and immediately grabbed at his chest and neck. Clearly shocked about what had happened and it was only made worse by the beeping coming from the heart monitor next to him.

‚ÄúHina‚Ä¶‚Äù Mason whispered softly.

His mind was on fire from the pain he still couldn't beat. His body felt like stone and sluggish like tar, yet he still managed to reach for the call button on the small table next to the medical bed.

‚ÄòWhen will you join me Mason?‚Äô Hina's voice softly echoed in his mind.


‚ÄúWhen you stop helping the Sirens‚Ä¶‚Äù Mason said out loud as the door clicked shut.

It was Vestal with Esther who was off to the side. Both had different expressions on their faces, but Esther's was a soft yet sad look.

‚ÄúYou seem fine now, are you feeling any pain?‚Äù Vestal asked as she placed a  Stethoscope to his chest.


‚ÄúI feel like I died‚Ä¶ Again‚Ä¶‚Äù Mason groaned.


‚ÄúWell you did, and luckily for you Natalie brought you back at the cost of keeping your cube from breaking.‚Äù Vestal answered as she grabbed his arm and felt for his pulse.

Mason grabbed at his chest once again, but this time he couldn't feel his cube within. 

‚ÄúI feel empty‚Ä¶ Hollow‚Ä¶‚Äù Mason said softly looking at Esther.

Vestal set down a tablet and walked over to Esther.  ‚ÄúHe's good to go, He's in your hands now so make sure he gets dressed and then take him to the beach or whatever you feel is best for someone in his position.‚Äù

‚ÄúY-Yes ma'am‚Ä¶‚Äù Esther answered, clutching her book.

Esther closed the door after Vestal had left, and the tension in the air was thick enough to be chewed.

‚ÄúA-Are you okay? I tried to help you, but something went wrong.‚Äù Esther nervously asked.


‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Mason said after what seemed like one of the longest 30 seconds that Esther had experienced. ‚ÄúYou tried to help, I think that's important.‚Äù


‚ÄúEr‚Ä¶ You are welcome? I think. In reality I didn't get to do much, most of the heavy lifting you did it yourself‚Äù Esther said as she averted her eyes from the young man.


‚ÄúYou did something there. Looked like a ball of light, made me feel much better.‚Äù Mason said as his hand hovered over his chest.


‚ÄúOh that? That was just something to dispel doubts and bring some level of clarity. Think of it as some coffee with extra mojo to it.‚Äù Esther said, trying to sound cheerful but only achieving an awkward smile from her part.


‚ÄúI don't think I ever felt so safe within one of my nightmares‚Ä¶‚Äù Mason said looking at the same window that Esther was using to avoid looking at him.


‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ Do you get these often?‚Äù Esther said before she interrupted herself ‚Äúugh‚Ä¶ of course you do. Otherwise it wouldn't hold such a concise shape. Sorry, don't mind me.‚Äù


‚ÄúWait, no. What do you mean by ‚Äòconcise‚Äô?‚Äù Mason asked.


‚ÄúOh. Nightmares tend to be blurry and somewhat vague at best, only the main fear factor is the one being shown, like a spider, or losing control of a car‚Äôs brakes. Everything else tends to be foggy at best, But yours was already well established on what would happen and who would appear and what they would do‚Äù Esther explained. 


‚ÄúAh. Yeah makes sense. I see that nightmare so often that there are even variants like in that simulation, where I am just a spectator to see my own suffering.‚Äù Mason answered in a soft defeated tone.


‚ÄúWell now it should be better i think‚Äù Esther said as she nervously flipped through the pages of her grimoire.


‚ÄúUh? What do you mean? Do you have something to help me with the nightmare?‚ÄùMason said, his eyes gain a bit of relief. 


‚ÄúWell yes, but actually no. One second.‚Äù Esther said as she found the page she was looking for, putting the book on a table nearby. ‚ÄúThe simulation is not done for the sake of simply watching your inner fears. Knowing them helps greatly. Most people that undergo this procedure show rather positive results in their overall mental wellness.‚Äù

As Esther continued talking she began scribbling on the book with a special pen she produced from her book bag. The more she scribbled the brighter the book became. At the same time it felt as if the room was becoming dimmer, as well as somewhat heavier.

Mason suddenly felt as if he was about to suffocate under the weight of the dark waters of the unknown depths of the sea, this sensation lasted but a moment until Esther was done and she produced a single trinket from her book.

She handed Mason a roundish stone with a single hole in the middle, the stone was small and fit comfortably in his palm.

‚ÄúThis is a hag- er- an Adder stone. It should help ward you from evil spirits. Think of it as a charm that will chase nightmares away.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Mason said as he looked confused at the stone and then back at Esther a few times. ‚ÄúBut you said the simulation greatly helps. Was that a lie?‚Äù


‚ÄúOh the simulation is a great form of therapy. But it's not immediate, and this little pebble is but a stopgap measure.‚Äù


‚ÄúOh‚Äù Mason said intelligently as he stared at the stone.


‚ÄúMason, can you stand up?‚Äù Esther asked as she looked again at the window, but this time it didn't look as if she was trying to avoid looking him in the eyes.


‚ÄúI think so? Vestal said I could move already. Why do you ask?‚Äù


‚ÄúIt's a nice day out there, I think it would be good for you to get your feet on the water. Let the waves take away your worries and all that.‚Äù Esther said as she approached Mason, helping him stand up.

Esther was sitting on a beach chair, under a big umbrella, enjoying the breeze, a drink, watching a healthy young man frolic on the water.

All in order to avoid making the phone call she was supposed to do within moments of watching her mother kissing the legendary commander of Azur Lane.

Unfortunately, her phone rang but only two times before the call was picked by her father.

‚ÄúOh hey Dad. We arrived at Azur Lane.‚Äù Esther said.


‚ÄúIs everything alright sweetie? You sound off.‚Äù Her father asked, sounding quite off himself.


‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶ we met the legendary commander, Mom met her.‚Äù Esther said, attempting her best to explain the situation while not really talking about what had happened.


‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ With her captain?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

""Was there kissing? involved?""


""Er... yes..."" Esther answered, confused by the sudden abruptness of the question.


She could hear her father sighing on the other side of the while. ‚Äúok, ok, yeah. I kinda expected something like this to happen when i heard your motehr said her captain had returned‚Ä¶‚Äù


""Wha-what does this mean? What are you... What are -We- going to do?"" Esther asked, feeling rather nervous as she didnt know what her father was thinking or planning.


""It‚Äôs vacation time i guess"" He said sounding rather defeated.


""You-You are going away?! Are you giving up on mom?!"" Esther all but spat at the phone, surprising Mason who looked in her direction inquisitively.


Esther nervously signaled that everything was ok, pointing at her phone and mimicking what she imagined one‚Äôs face looked when talking with one parent‚Äôs. This, along with a shirtless young Mason in front of her, made her blush as she realized she was just making faces without being able to convey what she meant to. 

Mason didn't question her expressions and gave a shrug before turning back towards the water. He could just ski out there towards where he felt his ship and be alone, or he could watch the training fights that he could see from where he stood.

‚ÄúI'm going to go find Natalie‚Ä¶ Are you going to be okay here alone?‚Äù Mason turned and asked.

Esther nodded, keeping her phone to her head along with a thumbs up letting Mason go on ahead.

Mom wasn't holding back one bit, every move she made was precise and intentionally heavy and cold. I was struggling to keep her planes away and making sure mine had room to breathe. 

‚ÄúCabot, warning‚Ä¶ Bataan has steadily increased her power output and is close to blowing up her ships engines. I recommend that you end this retreat.‚Äù Zero's voice filled my ears as I summoned the Wrench and swatted a hellcat out of the air.


‚ÄúMom's not one to give up Zero, and I'm trying to but she's an actual kansen! I'm just half!‚Äù I exclaimed as I launched my last flight of planes.


‚ÄúCall the plane you are so close with‚Ä¶ Trust me.‚Äù Zero said as a plane almost hit my rigging with a set of bombs.

But what I failed to see was mom's rigging and her planes on my left.

‚ÄúOh shi-‚Äù 

Before anything could connect to my body or rigging mom was pelted by paint rounds from behind her, causing her to fall forward onto the waves, bringing into sight my special Hellcat that was back in the repair bay.

‚ÄúH-Hey there little one‚Ä¶ you've gotten all fixed up didn't ya?‚Äù I asked as the Hellcat sputtered around after transforming Into its smaller self.

Mom forced herself back to her feet and kept enough space between us so her planes wouldn't hit mine, but it was clear that I had won this scuffle fair and square.  Then we both took a breath.

‚ÄúYou fought well sweetheart.‚Äù Mom said as she held her arms over her head.


‚ÄúWould you believe me if I told you I'm over two hundred and thirty percent Compatibility?‚Äù I asked after taking a deep breath. 

Mom completely crumpled to her knees in defeat right in front of me before falling backwards letting her body sink slightly into the water.

‚ÄúI should have never even tried‚Ä¶‚Äù Mom huffed as one of her Hellcats started to fly around her.


‚ÄúDon't sell yourself short momma‚Ä¶‚Äù I reached down and grabbed her by her arms, pulling her to her feet. ‚ÄúYou hit me more than I hit you, plus zero didn't do anything but tell me to finish quickly.‚Äù


‚ÄúFine, fine‚Ä¶ let's just get to the docks‚Ä¶ I'm tired‚Ä¶‚Äù Mom said softly, leaning on my shoulder as I moved us towards the docks.

Luckily for me Mason was standing at the same dock that mom and I were going towards.

‚Äò‚ÄúHey Mason, could you give me a hand here?‚Äù I called out as my mom dispersed her rigging.

Mason quickly moved to the edge and held out his hands. Mom reached out and grabbed His forearm and tried pulling herself up, but slipped slightly, but luckily Mason reacted quick enough to grab her arm, pulling her onto the dock where she immediately bent over and threw up seawater.

‚ÄúWere you fighting each other?‚Äù Mason asked, reaching down to pull me up.


‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I answered softly, moving closer to him and hugging him without thinking and squeezing him tightly.

Wiping her mouth and shaking her hair out mom let out a weak laugh as she moved to my side.

‚ÄúWow, that's adorable.‚Äù Mom smiled. ‚ÄúThere's only two men she'll hug like that‚Ä¶ Her father and the Commander. Count yourself lucky Boy‚Ä¶‚Äù


‚ÄúIs this a bad thing or?‚Äù Mason asked, while he hesitantly placed his left hand on my middle back.

Mom placed a hand on his shoulder and smiled. ‚ÄúOnly if you make it one‚Ä¶‚Äù

She then whispered into my ear. ‚ÄúIf his Mother was here she'd be taking pictures.‚Äù


‚ÄúOh! Before I leave you two lovebirds alone, your father and the Commander called in a favor to get you a teacher who has a record of close range combat!‚Äù Mom exclaimed as she scurried away leaving me and Mason embarrassed.

Their attention was soon brought by someone calling them not too far away. A quick look revealed that the person that had called to them was none other than commander Artyom, followed by two women wearing long-sleeved white ornamental coats, indicating that maybe the two others hailed from the Sakura Empire.

‚ÄúGreetings, everyone. I was notified of the duel taking place by the shore and decided this might be the right time to move our plans forward a bit.‚Äù Commander Artyom said after the youngsters saluted him.

‚ÄúIt wasn't a duel, Sir. Just a sparring match.‚Äù Natalie tried to excuse herself from the situation she suddenly found herself in.

‚ÄúThere was an official request for the area, filled in by an already retired member of Azur Lane, asking for the place for combat practice, and I was made aware there was some sort of wager on the line.‚Äù The commander said, raising an eyebrow and looking at Natalie, almost as if inviting her to correct him.

Natalie shrank a little bit at that. By the commander‚Äôs description it had truly been a duel of sorts. The commander seemed to notice that Natalie finally agreed with his statement and he simply moved on to the next subject as he cleared his throat.

‚ÄúNow, as it is obvious that you are growing in power and skills, we have deemed it necessary to get you some proper training with more, -traditional- warfare equipment.‚Äù The commander said.

‚ÄúI present to you, Shoukaku and Zuikaku from the Sakura Empire.‚Äù The commander said as he gestured towards the two tall women who in turn bowed elegantly in response.

Natalie couldn't help but to be slightly startled by the motion, she wasnt an stranger to formal greetings, thanks to some coaching done by Luna. But it somehow slipped her mind that she should have tried to remember the gist of it when she saw the two ladies from the Sakuran Isles.

Natalie did a proper greeting, bowing at the right angle but if a bit too stiff, she even recalled a single phrase that Luna had taught her, a simple ‚Äújack of all trades‚Äù phrase that could work as long as one made it obvious that it was meant to be a greeting.

The Shoukaku and Zuikaku seemed to react positively at her greeting. Zuikaku with her long light brown hair and brown eyes, crossed her arms in front of her chest and smiled approvingly at Natalie. Shoukaku while wearing a similar attire to her sister, created a sharp contrast with her sister with her white hair and clear blue eyes. She smiled much more reservedly but it was obvious that her smile reached her eyes, seemingly pleased by Natalie‚Äôs gesture.

‚ÄúNice to meet you Santos-san,Mason-kun.‚Äù Shoukaku said as she bowed her head minutely again.

The older sister‚Äôs greeting was simple, yet Natalie could see that there were well practiced movements taking place, there was a certain elegance to her movements. Natalie wondered briefly if she was able to notice this thanks to the time she had spent with Luna, it was quite likely to be the case.

While Shoukaku went through the proper etiquette, her sister seemed to want to say something, but there was probably Sakuran manners impeding her from doing it so.

‚ÄúI am Shoukaku, from the Sakura Empire. This is my beloved younger sister Zuikaku.‚Äù Shoukaku said with an elegant bow and gesturing towards her sister, even while her words were quite affectionate and obviously teasing.

‚ÄúNe-Nee-san!‚Äù Zuikaku squealed in surprise before correcting herself.

‚ÄúAh! Yes, I am Zuikaku! We will be in charge of your training, pleased to meet you!‚Äù Zuikaku said, sounding still surprised, her voice taking a slightly higher tone off voice before she made a sharp bow.

Natalie was startled again by this and bowed back, just like Luna had taught her before. Mason looked at her slightly confused, making him bow as well.

The three of them were startled by a soft chuckle that escaped Shoukaku‚Äôs lips and an alarmed meep sound that escaped her younger sister Zuikaku.

I will have some free time to explore on my own while they are preoccupied, and I wanted to ask for your opinion, as locals!

  
1. Do you recommend Suzhou or Zhujiajiao for a half day trip? I have one whole free day, and I was thinking of going out of the city. I was set on heading to Zhujiajiao, but after watching some videos it doesn't seem too worth it (plus taking the boat ride on my own sounds expensive, it was 600 rmb for a short ride i think lol). 

2. Is it worth it going to Wukang Road? I do love to take photos, and the building sure looks interesting, but most people go there for that one photo spot + shopping along the streets. I don't really intend to shop, I prefer to explore + take pictures. Or are there other places worth going to besides that? 

Thanks! Also if any ladies are free for a cup of tea or coffee, I'd be happy to make some friends (and I'd love to show you around Hong Kong too!)",0,1750910821.0,shanghai,0,0.4,False
1lkqktb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PassNclex/comments/1lkqktb/passed_my_nclex_9_month_journey/,Passed my nclex 9 month journey,"I finally passed the NCLEX on my 4th try ‚Äî here‚Äôs my journey and what I learned ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

Hey everyone,
I just passed the NCLEX on 6/21 ‚Äî it was my 4th attempt, and I made it through with 150 questions. I wanted to share my journey to inspire anyone else who‚Äôs struggling or feeling discouraged.

To be honest, I didn‚Äôt take nursing school as seriously as I should have. I coasted through by getting help from classmates, finessing homework and exams, and not really learning the material deeply. I graduated with a decent GPA and even started a nurse residency last October ‚Äî but I hadn‚Äôt taken the NCLEX yet.

Most of my peers had already passed, and I kept it quiet that I hadn‚Äôt even taken the exam. Since I wasn‚Äôt licensed, my preceptor had to sign off all my meds, and I often hid from peers because I was embarrassed.

I took the NCLEX for the first time in November ‚Äî used only Mark Klimek lectures ‚Äî and failed at 120 questions. I got a warning from my program: I had two months to pass or I‚Äôd be let go.
Tried again in January using just Archer (only did questions, didn‚Äôt study content) and failed in 108 questions. That one broke me. I was going through a lot financially, ended up getting kicked out of the residency, and honestly hit rock bottom. I was embarrassed, broke, depressed, and completely mentally drained. I distanced myself from friends and took on odd jobs just to make ends meet. I even had to borrow money from family.

On my third attempt, I stuck with Archer and got a Kaplan tutor. This time, I focused only on content and barely did any questions. I thought that would help, but I failed again in April ‚Äî 150 questions. I was devastated. But something inside me wouldn‚Äôt let me quit.

Fourth time around, I changed my whole approach.
I bought UWorld and stuck with just that. I studied consistently and reviewed content once a week. I stopped isolating myself ‚Äî I hung out with friends, lived a balanced life, and tried to stay mentally healthy. I even attended Mark Klimek‚Äôs in-person lecture in Ohio.

And finally ‚Äî last Saturday ‚Äî I PASSED. 150 questions. I can‚Äôt even describe the feeling when I saw the word ‚ÄúPASSED.‚Äù I want every single one of you to feel that too.

‚∏ª

If you‚Äôre on your NCLEX journey, here‚Äôs my advice:
	‚Ä¢	You are NOT alone. Everyone‚Äôs path is different. You deserve to be an RN, and your time is coming.
	‚Ä¢	Stick to ONE platform. Whether it‚Äôs UWorld, Archer, SimpleNursing, or Bootcamp ‚Äî just choose one and fully commit. Don‚Äôt jump between resources.
	‚Ä¢	Do LOTS of practice questions. Minimum 2,000 before your exam. Seriously. Focus on understanding why each answer is right or wrong.
	‚Ä¢	Review content weekly. You don‚Äôt need to cram every detail, just make sure you understand safety, side effects, interventions ‚Äî the NCLEX is a safety exam.
	‚Ä¢	Common weak areas: Basic care and comfort, safety precautions, and triage. These came up for me every single time.
	‚Ä¢	Optional but helpful: If you can afford it, get the ‚ÄúFundamentals of Nursing‚Äù book by Potter & Perry. Read the chapters and do the questions ‚Äî they really helped build my core knowledge. Mark Klimek even recommended it after reviewing my score report.
	‚Ä¢	Control your anxiety. That was a huge issue for me. I used prayer, meditation, GABA stress gummies, and yes ‚Äî coffee on test day üòÖ. Do what works for YOU. Arrive early, take deep breaths, and do something fun the day before.

Most importantly: don‚Äôt isolate yourself. Be around people you love. Don‚Äôt let this test steal your peace. The fourth time around, I lived a balanced life, studied smart (not just hard), and passed with a calm mind.

‚∏ª

I‚Äôm rooting for every single one of you reading this. I know how dark the journey can feel. But I promise ‚Äî with consistency, the right mindset, and the belief that YOU belong in this profession ‚Äî you will get there.

You are going to be the amazing, heart-centered nurses the world needs. Keep going. üíô",2,1750910779.0,PassNclex,2,1.0,False

1lkqkhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lkqkhz/the_blue_door/,The Blue Door,"I found this letter locked in an antique desk. I hope you all can make more sense of it than I can:

‚ÄúI love my late husband. He was the light of my life. He was as stoic, and reliable as men come. He was kind, considerate, generous, and brave. He touched not just my life, but the lives of so many more. He was a good man. However, what he bequeathed me after his departure has cost me many nights of sleep. My dreams are plagued by that blue door, that door to the deepest depths. I love my late husband, but I also hate him for what he, and his family have burdened me with.

I feel a great guilt for my conflicted feelings. He has been my lifelong companion since my parents were killed for the simple crime of freeing poor souls from the chains of slavery. They were shot by gunslingers whilst smuggling a black family into union states. Their deaths were quickly avenged by the couple who would become my adoptive parents. They were a French family. Their son was named Louis. We had been engaged since the day of our birth.

Louis, and I spent almost every day together after my parent‚Äôs deaths. He was a well read boy, and would tell me fantastical stories of knights, dragons, and ghosts. He was quite imaginative too, and was a fantastic writer. He had many works published in various publications. We spent many a day wandering his parent‚Äôs Maine property, just exploring. I have fond memories of us picking apples, and sharing kisses as the autumnal leaves fell around our ears.

Louis‚Äôs parents often spent months away from the mansion, doing their great work. Whenever they were home, Louis‚Äôs mother would train me with a sword. She was quite adept with a blade. She always said the days of the fair maiden were coming to an end, and soon women everywhere would need to pick up arms to protect their homes, same as the men. As she taught me to fight, Louis‚Äôs father taught me to look into the stars. He showed me many planets within God‚Äôs sky. He told me about how sailors would use them to guide themselves home, and how many cultures would worship them.

One summer day, when I was 19, I remember Louis being led into the woods by his father. I was training blades with his mother. We had forsaken modesty to prevent heatstroke, and to protect the integrity of our clothes. Whilst a hot-blooded young man would have grown red at the sight of seeing their future wife in bloomers, I saw he was so pale, and distraught that his natural instincts were forgotten. When I saw him being led away from those woods, I thought I had seen a specter from one of Louis‚Äôs horror stories.

I think part of Louis died that day. He was never quite the same after that. His eyes were always somewhat hollow, and his nights were as sleepless as mine are now. He refused to speak of what he saw that day. However, he promised he would show me that day. God forgive me, it was a vow I wished he had died before he had the ability to fulfill.

We wed on my 20th birthday. The ceremony, and subsequent afterparty were dignified enough. However, it was beyond boring. The gossip that the guests regurgitated was so pedantic that I felt I would die of the sheer stupidity of it all. I know the upper classes are obligated to placate ignorant guests such as these, but it is dull work. With God‚Äôs good grace, Louis whisked me away to a quiet corner of the wood with a smuggled bottle of wine, and some cake.

Six months after we were wed, Louis‚Äôs parents were killed in their marriage bed by a hired gun. Louis was devastated. All I could provide for him was my companionship. He had been my rock, so I tried my best to be his. He cried into my bosom, praying that God‚Äôs wrath would be brought down on those that robbed him of his loving parents. I hate to admit it, but I had lived with his parents for so long that I had forgotten the faces of my own, only remembering them by their reputations. I grieved with Louis.

I tried to bear him a child to fill the void left in his heart, and mine. However, the doctors told me I could not perform that particular duty as a wife. I went through a short-lived depressive episode. It wasn‚Äôt that I necessarily wanted to be a mother, but rather I wanted to bring my husband joy. I felt like I had failed him. However, Louis told me not to worry about that. He wanted my passion. He wanted to see me succeed in my dreams. He wanted me to live for me.

I hired a fencing instructor from Germany. Whilst he tried to instruct me, it seemed like I had more to teach him than he did for me. His ego wouldn‚Äôt allow him to do so. I hired another instructor, this time from Louis‚Äôs home country, France. This also ended with another bruised ego. The more instructors I managed to humiliate, the more I began to wonder just what Louis's mother was preparing me for. She told me a day that women must bear arms, but surely that day wouldn‚Äôt come in my lifetime, right? My prowess spread through the dueling world, and soon I was being challenged by fencers from across the lands. I began being known as The Scarlet Sting after the fiery waves of my orange hair, and the speed of my blade.

My accomplishments reached the papers, and made me the talk of the party. I would often be asked to perform tricks for my guests. Part of me was happy for the acknowledgement of my skill. However, I heard from behind paper fans about how unladylike I was, and how I played with swords atone for the fact that my womb was as bare as the Sahara. Even my fellow fencers wouldn‚Äôt take me seriously. Despite these fools, I never felt more alive than when I was behind the hilt of a rapier. I began to collect swords from all over the world, reveling in how peculiar the ignorant would find me. A man of my husband‚Äôs status would have a trophy room full of animal heads. However, he reserved that room for my collection.

Years into our happy marriage, civil war began to brew. Louis joined the army, to follow in the footsteps of not only his parents, but mine. The penultimate night before he departed for the front lines, he took my hand, and led me towards the treeline. He, and I wore our swords on our waist. He insisted.

‚ÄúI promised you that I would show you what my father showed me all those years ago,‚Äù Louis spoke to me in a solemn tone as we walked, stepping over overgrown roots as we did, guided only by the lantern he carried. I could see a primal fear in his eyes. They were like the eyes of a cat upon hearing the growl of a dog.

‚ÄúMy love, we do not need to do this now,‚Äù I tried to comfort him, squeezing his hand tightly.

‚ÄúI leave for the border the day after tomorrow, Should I die, I want you to know the secret my father kept when my family first moved to this country,‚Äù Louis rubbed my arm. We moved further into the woods than we ever dared to do so as children.

‚ÄúYou will not die, God will not allow a man such as yourself to do so. Yours is a noble, and just cause,‚Äù I tried to reassure him.

‚ÄúBoth of our parents had the same dream,‚Äù Louis dug his nails into the flesh of my palm. He was nervous as a hare, ‚Äúplease, just see what I must show you.‚Äù

I recalled how pale my love was when he returned from those woods all those years ago. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect, but I knew it would be nothing good. I couldn‚Äôt fathom what could possibly be beyond these trees. The branches seemed to reach down as if to halt our progress through the woods. Perchance, were they warning us of what was to come?

We soon reached a clearing. Dim moonlight shone down on what I thought was a smooth boulder, half buried in the grass. We drew closer, and I could feel a creeping dread permeating through my very soul. Just looking upon this seemingly innocuous thing felt like it would taint my spirit. Louis, and I circled around the boulder, and soon came upon a metal door, painted blue. It was of such alien, and peculiar construction that I know not how to begin describing it.

‚ÄúWhat is this thing?‚Äù I asked.

I received no answer for what felt like a half-hour. When I gazed upon my husband, it looked like he was searching for words that refused to come to him. Even a squeeze from my hand would not rouse him. He did speak eventually though.

‚ÄúThis accursed thing is the death of our world,‚Äù he finally answered, ‚Äúand it is my duty to make sure it never opens. When my father brought me here, we were greeted by the roar of a thousand screaming beasts. They clawed, and gnawed at the door, ready for our flesh. However, they were unable to escape. We watch this door to make sure nothing escapes. We are the protectors of God‚Äôs holy creation.‚Äù

My eyes would not leave that blue, metal rectangle. My mind wandered as I began to imagine what horrors lie beyond this door. My love‚Äôs father protected this place, and Louis would too with the Lord‚Äôs blessing. My husband clutched onto me, so I held him close. He was clearly terrified. He was about to run into battle with a rifle in hand, and this door was what scared him. My own fear began to take hold. I obviously wished he would return to be with me again. However, my cowardice also wished he would return so that I would not be left alone with this damned thing.

That night was spent in silence. The next was spent in our marriage bed, our room echoing with the sounds of our love. We held each other in a loving embrace, our sweet kisses comforting the other that everything would be alright. It was the last night I saw him. Louis fought for six long weeks before a stray cannonball made me into a widow.

I wore black much longer than most. My grief was beyond what could be comprehended by those who pretended to be my friends. The false sympathy I was given enraged me to such an extent, that I became a recluse for the safety of those who would otherwise offer me what they would consider comfort. A part of me died the day Louis was taken from me. First my parents, then my adoptive parents, and now my husband were all taken from me. I was alone. Even in a house full of servants, I was alone.

Days after Louis‚Äôs death, I was given a strange looking key by his Last Will and Testament. It didn't look like any key that belonged to our mansion. It was thinner, and more jagged. I let it gather dust in my jewelry box for almost a decade while I mourned. I cared not for what lay beyond that damned door. It mattered not. Nothing mattered when compared to the darkness of the ever growing void in my heart.

I wasn‚Äôt the same. I grew to drink. My skill with a blade grew rusty. I lost the use of my off-hand in a duel. I had to wear a sling so it would not get in my way. I fell from grace. I didn‚Äôt care. To hell with those ignorant fools. I cared not for what they thought. Even those who claimed to know my pain weren‚Äôt spared my disdain, for they did not love their husbands like I had loved mine.

Doctors tried to diagnose me with mental illness. They might have tried to pull me from my station if not for my collection of swords that I kept nice, and sharp. I didn‚Äôt need to verbally threaten them, the steely glint of malice in my eye was more than sufficient. The fear in their eyes made me smirk. It was one of the few joys I had left in my life.

I might have forgotten about the door, if I hadn‚Äôt thrown a bottle at my own reflection. The crash knocked my jewelry box off the bureau, and awoke the butler. As he cleaned the debris, I noticed that key. On that fateful night, I no longer saw it as a key to ruin. I saw it was a key to an end to this nightmare.

Emboldened by drink, I strapped a sword to my hip, and stormed off through the woods. My head swam as I took that familiar path. The trees again seemed to be trying to keep me from my destination. I ignored them. I pushed the branches out of my way, and cut down any that were persistent. I soon reached that spot. It seemed to be welcoming me like an old friend. I cared not if God damned me for my actions. If he saw fit to take my husband away from me, then he didn‚Äôt deserve to have my soul too.

I circled around the stone. The cool, damp grass felt good on the soles of my feet. I faced that door, hand on the pommel of my sword. I didn‚Äôt really intend to fight whatever was in there. I simply wished for it to take me. Me bringing the sword with me was merely an act of routine. I had the key in hand. My heart raced as I moved closer to my fate. The blue painted door was cold to the touch.

The key growled like a hungry beast as I pushed it in. Although the sound should have scared me, it was weirdly comforting. May the jaws of Hell swallow me whole. I opened the door, and was greeted by a dim blue glow. I recalled how Louis described the roar of a thousand screaming beasts. Yet I stood there unobstructed. I stepped through the door.

The room I found myself in was much larger than the boulder would have otherwise accommodated. I moved further into the darkness. About a dozen glowing windows illuminated the room. They seemed so strange. Attached to them were buttons, each of which had a letter of the alphabet. I went up to one of the windows, wondering what magic could empower it like this. I pressed a button with a ‚ÄúB‚Äù on it. On the window, a ‚ÄúB‚Äù appeared as if commanded by my action. I pressed the letters of my name, and my name appeared on the window.

A moan broke the silence from deep within the darkness. On the opposite side of the room, I could see a shadow on the wall. It took a bit of focus for me to recognize it was the entrance of a hallway. The noise sent a shiver along my skin. I cursed myself for not bringing a lantern. Still, I came here for a purpose. I took a deep breath, and moved towards the hall.

My nose was greeted by the smell of burnt coffee. As I blindly stumbled through down the hall, my hand guiding my path towards oblivion, the smell grew increasingly stronger. I saw a strong white light shining from beneath a door. I watched it, waiting for it to move. Perhaps it was that same strange magic I had seen in the room behind me. I turned the handle of the door, expecting the light to shift at any second. It never did. I opened the door.

The source of the light was a strange looking metal bar. I picked it up, shining the light around like a torch. What a peculiar little device. Although the end was quite hot, it didn‚Äôt burn like a fire. The furniture of this room was minimally decorated. They were nothing but efficient shapes, no artistry, no flair. It was as if all humanity was drained from this place. The source of the coffee smell was a strange looking device made of glass, and some unknown material. Nothing was left of the coffee but a dried scum on the bottom of the glass bowl.

A swift movement in my peripheral vision pulled me from my explorations, and sent a jolt through my system. I found the light in my hand was shaking madly. I had to focus to steady my hand. I shone the light down both ways of the hall. I saw multiple doors down this path. Quickly steadying myself for what was to come, I began to trudge down the way, moving further into this accursed place. The darkness swallowed me. I found myself in a stone stairway with a metal railing. I couldn‚Äôt identify the kind of stone this was. I had never seen something like this before.

I moved towards the stairs, and began to descend. The stairs seemed to spiral down into the eternal shadow, possibly into Hell itself. I pondered on who could have made a home like this. Perhaps it had been constructed by the prince of the abyss, Lucifer. It didn‚Äôt seem like any kind of depiction of Hell that had been preached to me by the local priest. However, he had never been here, so how would he know what Hell really looked like? Perhaps Hell changed with the march of time, same as our world did since the death of Jesus.

I knew this place was dangerous. I knew it was evil. I knew it was death. After all, I had come in here for it to be my tomb. However, I had never seen a corpse before this day, even with the life I had lived. I drew closer. The neck had been slashed. The woman wore a long white coat. It was perhaps the most modest thing that she wore. Her skirt was short, and her shirt was thin. It was clear there were no further layers beneath. Long orange hair cascaded down her shoulder. Her face looked disturbingly familiar. I had seen this face earlier tonight. I had seen it in my own mirror. This was my face. This woman was me.

I nearly dropped my light as the realization overtook me. I stared at my own dead body, struggling to comprehend what I was seeing. However, I didn‚Äôt have long to contemplate my situation. I heard a noise above me. It was footsteps. I couldn‚Äôt afford to be seen. My damned light. It was my salvation, but also my doom. I didn‚Äôt know what was coming, but I knew it would see me. However, I needed to be able to see.

I searched the shadow with the light quickly, as the footsteps drew closer. I saw a door on a landing. I put the light on the ground, facing the landing. I rushed down the stairs, and yanked open the door. I closed it behind me. The door had a small, rectangular window. It had wire running through it in a diamond pattern. I peeked out. I could see my light from here. A moment later, the footsteps reached the landing where the light, and my corpse were.

I could hear a heavy breathing coming from that direction. It sounded labored. The one responsible seemed in pain, and made little whining moans. It mumbled to itself. I had trouble discerning the gender of this thing, if a monster could have one to begin with. I heard the creature slobbering. My stomach churned as I heard the sickening crunch of the creature sinking its fangs into my corpse‚Äôs flesh. This damned thing was eating the other me.

As the dread overtook me, I gripped the handle of my sword. The wound in my corpse‚Äôs throat wasn‚Äôt made by some monster. It was made with a blade. Someone else was here. Someone who, no doubt, meant me harm. I stepped away from the door, trying to distance myself from that disgusting noise. However, no matter how far I walked, the noise always seemed like it was right in front of me. I had to hold back the contents of my stomach.

I nearly fell as my foot met a step. I turned. Down yet more steps, I could see a dim green glow. I thought back to the windows upstairs. Perhaps I would find more magic down here. I looked back to the door I had entered here from. Perhaps I would be safer away from the moist, crunching noise. I began to descend again. The glow grew closer. I soon stepped into a new room.

The place I had found myself was a long room, both walls lined with huge jars, filled with glowing liquid. Anywhere that the glow didn‚Äôt touch was shrouded in darkness. In the jar closest to me was the preserved remains of an unborn babe, no doubt cut from its mother‚Äôs belly. I instinctively drew my blade. I had almost forgotten I had brought it with me in this disgusting place. My eyes wandered to the other jars.

In another jar was a teenage girl. An arm protruded from her mouth, and seemed to be strangling her. Her belly had teeth. Her fingers were stubs. I thought at first the stubs were a birth defect, but no. They had been bitten off. Her hair was orange.

Another jar had an old woman with two heads. Her eyes were replaced by tongues. Her wide open mouth didn‚Äôt seem to have one, or teeth, or gums. Her mouth seemed like a bottomless hole. She had no arms, or legs. Instead, her skin was dotted with little suction cups, like those of an octopus.

The last one I could stomach to look at was a woman just a bit younger than I was. She had four arms growing out of her back. The arms she was supposed to have seemed to have been fused to her chest as if her body was a straight jacket. Her legs bent backwards. Her nose, and lips were nonexistent. Again, her hair was orange.

All of these twisted monstrosities were me. Every single one of these was a perversion of not only nature, but of my own form. This was Hell. So this was why Louis heard screaming monsters, and I didn‚Äôt. This wasn‚Äôt just Hell. This was my Hell. Would I become one of these twisted mockeries of lifes? No, I wouldn‚Äôt allow myself to be taken. This place wouldn‚Äôt be my fate. I had to get out of here.

The door above me opened. There wasn‚Äôt another door out of here. I was trapped. I slipped into the darkness quickly, as I heard shuffling creeping downwards, and towards my location. The noise grew louder, and louder. I could hear mumbling, and pained moaning. The beast sounded large, almost as big as a bear. I had long since sobered up. I kept myself curled up, sword in hand, and ready to strike.

The sight that invaded my vision left a stain on my soul. I nearly . The creature was hunched over, its hands dragging along the floor. I could see two of my face on its shoulder blades, chewing on the orange hair. The main face was mostly covered, but I could see blood dripping from its oversized teeth. I trembled. I didn‚Äôt know if I could take this monster in a duel, especially with only one hand. No, I had to be stealthy.

The monster trudged further into the room, sniffing the air. I knew it would be able to smell my fear. I paused near me. I held my breath, my hand covering my nose, and mouth. It turned in my direction. Its eyes were blank. It had to be blind. It sniffed. Its breath smelled of rotten flesh. I could see maggots in the creature‚Äôs gums from the dim glow. It moved its head closer, mouth opening. It caught my scent.

My blade launched forward, slicing open one of the monster‚Äôs eyes. Three mouths screamed. Now I know what Louis had heard all these years ago. It threw its head back, clutching its eye. Taking the opportunity, I slashed at the monster‚Äôs throat, then retreated into the darkness again. I slipped along the shadow, as the monster brought a hand down, and shattered one of the jars. The fluid splashed everywhere. Luckily, I had backed away from jar enough to not get the worst of it.

I used my sword to tap one of the jars further into the room, trying to lure the monster away from the staircase. The monster lunged at me, blood gushing from its wounds. Despite bleeding profusely, the freak still had immense energy, and strength. I dove out of the way as it crashed into the jar I had tapped on. I rushed towards the stairs, ignoring as broken glass stabbed into my bare feet. I tore my way upwards, ignoring the beast behind me.

I rushed down the hall. I could see my light from the doorway. The monster was ascending behind me. The glass dug deeper into my feet. I cursed my stupidity, but kept running regardless. The creature was getting closer. I could practically feel its rotten breath on the back of my neck. The hall shook as it bounded in my direction. I could hear the screaming of the mouths on its back. I burst through the door, and dove to the left.

The monster didn‚Äôt have time to correct its course. It careened over the railing, falling into the abyss. The screaming grew more, and more distant. I heard bone crunching as it smacked into the railing. The noises very quickly descended into nothingness. I was enveloped in silence once again

I limped up the stairs from one landing to the next, and picked up my light. I tucked it in the armpit of my useless arm so I could hold onto the sword. I didn‚Äôt want to think about what had happened to my corpse. I didn‚Äôt shine my light on it. I didn‚Äôt want to know. I just had to get out of here. I moved up the stairs, leaving bloody footprints behind me. God forgive me for my stupidity. I just hoped He would show me mercy, and allow me to leave this place.

I found myself in the room with the windows again. I trudged forward. Sunlight shone through the door. I looked at the sun, breathing heavily. I pushed my way through. I found myself on God‚Äôs green Earth once more. Desperately, I slammed the door behind me, and locked it as fast as I could.

The doctor examined my wounds. He was more worried about my mental state. However, I think he knew better than to try something, even in my injured state. He helped me recover. I walked with a limp from that day forward. I mourned Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs death, along with the rest of the country. I eventually stopped wearing black, and accepted guests into my home once more. I was more discerning with who I accepted as guests.

I took on students, and trained them in the art of the sword. I spoke of a day where everyone, regardless of gender, would need to pick up arms to defend their homes. It was the same thing that Louis‚Äôs mom would tell me. I still miss Louis. Even though I remarried, he will still be my one true love.

As time marched forward, new inventions came to light. The typewriter reminded me of those glowing blue windows I saw, and later the electric lightbulb reminded me of the tube that lit my way in that Hellhole. The world would one day begin to look like that hole. Perhaps it was my fault. Perhaps I let something out when I went in there, and now its corruption was spreading throughout the land. I try not to think about that, but I find it difficult to do. Every now and then, I can see something speed through my peripheral vision. 

Even now as I write this, I can hear a heavy breathing outside of my bedroom door whilst my new husband is away on business. I have my sword, and a pistol with me. God, I‚Äôm sorry for what I have done. Please, show me mercy.‚Äù

1lkqgx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lkqgx6/dont_listen_to_the_signal_bloom/,Don't listen to the Signal Bloom!,"It started with a hum.

Not the kind you notice right away. More like something you feel before you hear, like tension hanging in the air, like the press of silence that‚Äôs just too still. A vibration behind your eyes. A pressure in your chest. Like the world is holding its breath, but you‚Äôre the only one who notices.

I‚Äôd been working nights at Station KSTR for six months. Graveyard shift. It's a quiet Local radio. The kind of station that plays leftover weather reports, forgotten blues records, and the occasional conspiracy nut call-in. We broadcast across exactly three counties, most of which are cornfields and dead towns.

It was quiet work. Lonely, sure, but peaceful in its way. There‚Äôs something comforting about the sameness of it all. The static between songs. The low hum of the tower. The red light blinking in the dark, steady as a heartbeat.

Until that hum started.

I noticed it while queuing tracks. Just another night. Midnight playlist rolling. A caller left a voicemail about seeing eyes in his microwave, you know, standard stuff. I paused the system... just for a second to line up the next segment.

And in that slice of dead air, I heard it.

Low. Faint. Just a single, steady tone beneath everything. Not a sound exactly more like an echo of a sound, just at the edge of my hearing. Almost like something waiting just below the surface.

I leaned in. Thought maybe it was bleeding through from an old signal or maybe static bouncing off the tower. KSTR runs on gear older than I am, wouldn‚Äôt be the first time a busted wire made ghosts out of noise.

I turned the volume knob back down. Nothing.

Turned it up again. There it was.

A soft, warbling hum like the kind you hear when you're half-asleep and your brain hasn't decided if it's dreaming or not. It wasn‚Äôt constant. It fluttered a bit like it was alive. Like it was adjusting... to me.

I laughed at myself. Too much caffeine. Too little sleep.

Old building. Old gear. Probably interference. Maybe a loose ground wire or an AC vent buzzing too close to the booth.

But the next night, it was louder.

And this time, it didn‚Äôt stop when I turned the soundboard off.

Then silence, I texted Marlene, she's the morning host here at the station 

""Hey, have you noticed a hum all of a sudden?"" 

She texted back pretty quickly.

""No, Alex no I haven't. It's been quiet as always.""

That's odd, she normally calls me sugar or honey boo. Yeah, she is the type that crushes on younger guys, I laugh it off usually but not being called it... was kind of different,

It's now one of those shifts where time felt like soup thick, slow, flavorless just fucking boring. It tucked beneath the music like it was hiding.

It wasn‚Äôt part of the track I checked twice. When I paused the playback, the hum kept going. Real soft. Real steady. Almost like a voice that hadn't decided what language it wanted to speak.

At first, I thought maybe one of the amps was going bad, or interference from the old weather scanner. But when I leaned in close to the monitor speaker, I felt it buzz in my teeth.

And when I turned the volume up to isolate it,
the humming got clearer.


I mean I asked Marlene about it, but What would I say truly?

 ‚ÄúHey, the static on our dying community radio signal, well, it's talking to me?‚Äù

Not exactly grounds for a technician call.

The night was so slow, I wanted to pull my hair out but like what would that solve? 
The night was turning into the morning, 5:30 AM and any minute Marlene would be coming in.
To be fair she's kind of late, she's never late. She finally comes in, 10 minutes late. 

""Hey, you okay?"" 

She didn't respond to my question but when I asked again
 Marlene snapped. She‚Äôd been the cheery morning host everyone‚Äôs favorite voice with their coffee and stale cereal. That morning, her smile was gone. She walked like something was pulling her from the inside.

She whispered to me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let it hear you sleep.‚Äù
Then she just‚Ä¶ kept walking. What the fuck was that, who says that?

An hour later, someone found her in the breakroom mirror blood dripping down her face, nail marks carved across her ears. She kept muttering, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the tone‚Ä¶ the tone is alive‚Ä¶‚Äù

They said it was a breakdown. The stress. Maybe a bad drug? But I knew what I heard. It felt like it was growing louder.

Could this be the cause? I went home and noticed neighbors acting different and strange, I'll get death stares like I just stole their soul and they're wanting it back. Then I noticed something else that was odd.

 that fucking hum was on TV static my brother was in the kitchen as my dad was watching TV, he almost didn't look human just stuck in place, glued to his seat

As the night kept creeping, my eyes wouldn't shut. Couldn‚Äôt. The hum followed me home, through the air vents, through the silence between YouTube ads, and even in the quiet between my thoughts.
And sometimes, layered under the hum, there were words.

They weren‚Äôt in English.

Not at first.

The following day I decided to come in early. 

Desperate, I started recording the dead air from the station's empty channels, gaps between shows, and static sweeps from old analog feeds. I slowed them down and cleaned them up.

And then I heard it.

Breathing.

Something alive buried deep inside the white noise. A pattern. A rhythm. Not random. It was like something had been spliced beneath the frequency of perception. Not a glitch. A message. Repeated. Warped.

 ""We are not here to speak.
We are here to grow.""

I tried reaching out online. Forums. Tech threads. Pirate radio circles. That‚Äôs when someone named @SpectreEcho DMed me.

They wrote:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a virus. It‚Äôs a signal-based parasite. A psychoacoustic weapon. A seed. Don‚Äôt listen too long. Don‚Äôt spread it.‚Äù



Then another message:

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre using us as antennas. We‚Äôre the soil.‚Äù

 That wasn't normal we're antennas? What kind of nonsense is this? But...
That night at the station, everything went wrong.


The lights dimmed. The emergency broadcast system kicked on by itself, blaring static across every channel. The playlist was corrupted. The air smelled like hot metal and rotted flowers.

And I heard the voice again.
Only this time‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt behind the static.
It was inside me.

‚ÄúBloom,‚Äù it said.

I ran.

I didn‚Äôt want to find out what that meant, I did what that DM told me to do, I didn‚Äôt listen to long, but now this night will change my life forever.

As I bust out the doors to the radio station I see Marlene still here but something seems off. Holy fuck, she's beating one of our coworkers with a crowbar. As I see this unfold a car zips right in front of me like I was in a fast and furious movie. 

""Get in, now!"" 

She says then I noticed some of my other coworkers rushing to me, all looking equally ready to do me in like poor Jim, Marlene didn't hold back. 
I get in the car and she speeds off.

""Who are you?""

I said as I rushed to put on my seat belt with shaky hands, she didn't answer then finally she spoke up.

""Amy, I'm the one who DM'd you, listen this is shit, everything is going to shit, some type of broadcast signal that will control people's minds. I got the leak for it and well it didn't do me any good.""

I look around as she zooms past houses of people killing one another, they're like what you see in movies, literally zombies but instead of eating each other they're just brutally bashing skulls in I mean this is insane.

""How is this a thing? When the fuck did this become a thing?"" 

She looks over to me noticing my face about to blow up with anxiety and what I would imagine a whole lot of fear! 

Amy drove like a demon was on our tail. Maybe one was. The roads blurred past empty now, except for flashes of violence on porches, in front yards, in living rooms lit by flickering screens.

I pressed my back into the seat, my heart hammering like it wanted out.
Amy spoke again, softer this time.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want you to get pulled into this. But you were already too deep. That signal, it's not just noise it‚Äôs designed. It grows. Latches on to minds like fungus in a warm place.‚Äù

We turned down a side road I didn‚Äôt recognize. She killed the headlights and coasted the car into a ditch, out of view.

I asked, ‚ÄúSo what now? Is this... the end of the world?‚Äù

Amy looked at me like she wasn‚Äôt sure either. ‚ÄúNot the world. Just us. People. Minds. They‚Äôre testing something, I think. Or it‚Äôs already out of their hands.‚Äù

She reached behind her seat and pulled out a clunky-looking metal case. Unlatched it. Inside was a handheld device a mismatched Frankenstein of knobs, wires, and what looked like an old radio scanner smashed together with something military-grade.

‚ÄúThis thing picks up the deeper band,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBelow normal ranges. Ultra-low frequency. The kind of sound you feel before you hear.‚Äù

I leaned closer. The screen flickered with strange waveforms. Jagged pulses. Sharp peaks. All too... rhythmic.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still broadcasting,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúGod help us.‚Äù

I wanted to ask what it was the signal, the parasite, the voice but I think I already knew. Not in my brain, but in my bones. Something had cracked open in the world, and we‚Äôd all heard the echo.

We holed up in an abandoned hardware store that night. Amy knew the owner or what was left of him. We blocked the windows with boards, rigged a few battery-powered floodlights, and waited.

The humming never stopped. It wasn‚Äôt outside anymore. It wasn‚Äôt even in the air.

It was in me.

Now and then, Amy would check her signal meter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs spiking,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs adapting to us.‚Äù

Sleep wasn‚Äôt an option. Every time I closed my eyes, I heard things in the hum not just words now, but images, thoughts that weren‚Äôt mine. A flood of memories I‚Äôd never lived, places I‚Äôd never seen.

And then, around 4:00 a.m., the power died completely.

That‚Äôs when the Bloomers came.
That's what Amy called them. They're the ones that could push back the hum, I hear the hum but I can function, and so can the maniacs at the station but they wanted more of that humming sound. Bloomers they're different entirely, they're the ones who embraced whatever this was and became whatever they truly are.

Amy was the first to hear bone-deep scraping sounds, like fingernails on brick. We peeked through a crack in the boards.

They were people once. Still had faces, sort of. But their mouths were stretched too wide, their eyes pitch black, oozing something that shimmered like oil. They moved like puppets twitchy, off-time, glitched. And they were humming. In perfect sync.

One of them a teenage girl with a prom dress soaked in blood tilted her head toward the building.

Amy whispered, ‚ÄúThey can smell cognition. If you're awake, they know.‚Äù

We froze. I held my breath so long I nearly passed out.

They circled us for hours. Eventually, something called them away.

Not long after, the signal changed.

Not in pitch, but in message.

 ""We are not here to conquer. We are here to convert.""

The next day, Amy told me about the Numbers Stations the real ones, buried in forgotten corners of the shortwave dial. She said this started with one called Station Nyx. A blacklisted broadcast never officially acknowledged, caught only by ham radio freaks and off-grid military.

‚ÄúSome say it was made to control soldiers,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOthers say it was alien. But now? Now it‚Äôs just spreading. Like an illness.‚Äù

I asked, ‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù

She looked at me with tired eyes and said, ‚ÄúWe find the Root Tower. We burn it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the Root Tower?‚Äù

She paused.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet. But I know someone who does.‚Äù

We hit the road again, static crawling along every car radio we passed. Towns were going dark. Power grids failing. People were frozen in their living rooms like mannequins, and blood pooled at their ears. Other Bloomers just standing, humming, waiting for some signal none of us could hear.

The whole world was becoming a transmitter.

Amy‚Äôs contact? He lived off-grid, deep in the Red Hills, an ex-military signal analyst named Rourke.

She told me, ‚ÄúHe decoded part of the early broadcast. Claimed it wasn‚Äôt just a message... but a map.‚Äù

We try decoded the message, but it was more difficult than we initially realized, the world isn't what it used to be people are brainwashed with this humming sound the lucky ones are now fighting for their lives. Fuck what do we do?

""We need to move,"" she said we gathered our thing I'm guessing she found the message.
We drove for hours in silence, except for the occasional hiss of static that bled through the car‚Äôs speakers even when they were off.

Amy didn‚Äôt say much. Just kept her eyes on the road like it might vanish if she blinked too long.

The trees thickened as we reached the Red Hills. No cell signal. No birds. No wind. Just that hum faint now like it knew we were getting close to something it didn‚Äôt like.

The world had gone still again. But not peaceful.

That tension was back the one I felt before the first hum. Like the sky was holding its breath again.

We reached Rourke‚Äôs place just after sundown. A cabin built like a bunker, half-buried in earth and wrapped in sheets of weather-worn metal. Solar panels cracked. Wires strung across trees like trip lines.

Amy gave a signal with her flashlight. Three short flashes. A long one.

Nothing.

Then the door creaked open.

A man stepped out with a shotgun slung low and an expression that hadn‚Äôt seen sleep in weeks.

‚ÄúDid you bring the transmitter?‚Äù he asked, his voice raw like he‚Äôd swallowed the smoke.

Amy nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting worse.‚Äù

Rourke‚Äôs eyes flicked to me. ‚ÄúAnd him?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a carrier,‚Äù Amy said. ‚ÄúBut not converted.‚Äù

He looked me over like a doctor might look at a patient who‚Äôd survived something they shouldn‚Äôt have.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCome in. But don‚Äôt touch the glass.‚Äù

The inside of the cabin was colder than the outside. Not temperature just vibe. Like it remembered things.

Every surface was covered in equipment: wave monitors, analog receivers, modded ham radios, and old tube TVs cycling through static. But the most disturbing thing was the mirrors.

All of them were covered in aluminum foil and duct tape. Every single one.

Amy noticed me staring. ‚ÄúThey come through reflective surfaces,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOr maybe they just see better in them. We don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

Rourke sat us down in front of a rusted rack server, humming with old energy and something that smelled like ozone and burnt plastic.

‚ÄúI traced the origin of the first broadcast,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt from a satellite. Wasn‚Äôt even from Earth.‚Äù

Amy leaned in. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

He pulled up a screen and tapped through files. Diagrams. Old schematics. Coordinates.

‚ÄúIt came from deep space,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThen it hit a relay an old NSA listening post buried under Raven Rock. From there, it spread to every dead signal slot across the shortwave and VLF bands. They weren‚Äôt using our tech. Just... piggybacking on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Station Nyx?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúPrototype,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSome spook-level black project. They tried to use the signal first‚Äîweaponize it. They thought it could erase enemy morale. Turn insurgents docile. But it didn‚Äôt work.‚Äù

He paused.

‚ÄúNot how they wanted it to.‚Äù


That‚Äôs when he showed us the tape.

A reel-to-reel audio recording. Labeled in smeared marker: NYX-00.A

He played it.

At first, it was just static. Then the hum, faint and pulsing. Beneath it, words. Distorted. Looping.

 ‚ÄúDo not resist. Do not dream. You are the signal. You are the soil.‚Äù


I didn‚Äôt realize I was crying until I felt the wetness on my cheeks.

Amy looked worse. Pale. Lips trembling.

Rourke killed the playback. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how it begins,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt speaks through frequency, not meaning. It bypasses language and goes right to instinct, memory, emotion.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt plants itself.‚Äù

And then he opened a drawer and pulled out a map.

Not of the state.

Not of the world.

Of frequencies.

The map was a weave of lines and tones, like musical notation scribbled by something that didn‚Äôt understand music the way we do. Peaks and pulses, signal corridors. And right at the center, a knot of transmission lines labeled in red ink:

Root Tower.

‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù Amy asked, her voice small.

Rourke looked at her, then at me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mobile,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre moving it. Like it knows we‚Äôre looking.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve found it before. Or thought we did. But it‚Äôs always somewhere else the next day.‚Äù

I asked, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

Rourke hesitated, then said:

‚ÄúA machine. A living transmitter. Or maybe just something made to look like a tower. Built around a spine. Grown, not constructed.‚Äù

Amy looked like she was about to throw up.

Rourke continued. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve seeded the world in layers. The first layer? The hum. The second? Cognition. Then dreams. Then form. Once they anchor the Root long enough... they become real.‚Äù


That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Not even pretend to.

The hum was louder in the hills. And with it, the voices.

This time, I heard my mother.

Only, she‚Äôs been dead for two years.

She whispered:

‚ÄúYou were never meant to wake up. Go back. Go back to silence.‚Äù

I sat in the dark with my eyes wide open until dawn painted the windows in dirty orange.

Amy came to sit beside me. She didn‚Äôt speak at first. Then, she whispered:

‚ÄúI dreamed I was blooming. Not like flowers. Like... splitting. Peeling back. And something inside me was smiling.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt speak for a long time after that.


In the morning, Rourke handed us a radio tuned to a specific static channel.

‚ÄúStation Nyx is going active again,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNew tones. Different modulation. It‚Äôs a call.‚Äù

‚ÄúA call for what?‚Äù

Amy asked nervously.

‚ÄúFor everything that‚Äôs been seeded‚Ä¶ to wake up.‚Äù

We hit the road again.

Only this time, we weren‚Äôt just running.

We were hunting.

Or being hunted.

Or both.

But one thing was clear:

The signal was alive.

And it wasn‚Äôt done growing.


We didn‚Äôt leave Rourke‚Äôs cabin until after sundown.

Amy didn‚Äôt want to wait, but Rourke insisted. Said the Bloomers were less active at night. Said it had something to do with signal fluctuation frequencies that bounced differently after dark, lost momentum, and scattered. I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was science or superstition, but I took it either way.

We packed only what mattered: the modified radio, the signal map, a battered topographical layout of the county, and a small black bag Rourke wouldn‚Äôt let me touch. He just handed it to Amy and said, ‚ÄúOnly use this if you‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs the Root.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt ask what was in it.

Some things are better not known until they have to be.

We set out down a twisted backroad that hadn‚Äôt been paved in years. Trees creaked overhead like old bones. The deeper we went, the more the air started to feel wrong. Not just thick warped. Like sound didn‚Äôt carry the same anymore. I said something to Amy once and heard it echo off the trees like we were inside a giant empty shell.

About thirty miles out, the trees gave way to flatland. The fields were mostly empty now. Just long swathes of dead stalks and rusted irrigation arms stretching like skeletons under moonlight. It should‚Äôve felt open. It didn‚Äôt. It felt watched.

Amy turned off the radio. It hadn‚Äôt played music in hours. Just subtle pulses of static. Like a heartbeat buried deep in the white noise.

She pointed up ahead. ‚ÄúFirst town‚Äôs coming.‚Äù

We slowed as we entered the border of what used to be North Bellview.

Population: 1,302, said the old green sign, riddled with bullet holes and rust.

But that number was a lie. Or a memory.

Because North Bellview wasn‚Äôt dead.

Not exactly.

It was something worse.

The streetlights still worked. That was the first strange thing.

They flickered a little, sure, but they cast a dim orange glow over cracked pavement and shattered storefront windows. The town looked like it had been evacuated, but not violently. Just... emptied. Like everyone had gotten up at once and walked away from their lives.

Then we saw them.

A figure standing at the edge of a grocery store parking lot. Motionless. Barefoot. Wearing a hospital gown that fluttered faintly in the night wind.

Amy slowed the car.

The figure didn‚Äôt react.

‚ÄúIs it a Bloomer?‚Äù I whispered.

Amy squinted. ‚ÄúToo still.‚Äù

We coasted past slowly, trying not to make noise, though I wasn‚Äôt sure it mattered anymore. The figure didn‚Äôt move. Just stood there. Head slightly tilted. Eyes locked on nothing.

The deeper we went, the more we saw them.

Dozens. Maybe hundreds. Standing in windows, sitting at bus stops, crouched on porches. All silent. All humming. Not loudly. Barely audible. But always in unison.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre waiting for the next signal,‚Äù Amy muttered. ‚ÄúThis town‚Äôs fully seeded.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt they come after us?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt see us yet. As long as we don‚Äôt engage... we‚Äôre just noise.‚Äù

We passed what looked like an old church. Someone had painted over the stained glass with black tar. Spray-painted the word ""ROOTED"" in red across the side of the building.

And beneath it, smaller:

‚ÄúWe heard it. We answered. We are one now.‚Äù

Amy wanted to stop at the library.

‚ÄúSmall-town libraries always kept maps,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOld ones. Before the lines changed.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt so sure stopping was a good idea, but I followed her inside.

The library was untouched. Clean. Dust hung in the air like a fog, caught in the flashlight beam. Books sat untouched. Desks remained in place. It smelled of paper, mildew, and something metallic underneath.

We headed for the back archives.

That‚Äôs when I heard it.

A whisper.

Not from Amy.

Not from the radio.

From inside the books.

I turned to one shelf and pulled a thick, leather-bound volume halfway free.

The humming grew louder.

Then the book fell open on its own.

The pages didn‚Äôt have text. Not words. Just rows and rows of frequencies. Numbers. Coordinates. Waveforms that danced across the page ...like they were moving.

I dropped it.

Amy rushed over. ‚ÄúWhat did you hear?‚Äù

I just shook my head.

She picked up the book, flipped through it fast, and froze.

""It‚Äôs more coding! Shit, we gotta go!""

She held it open to a page. It wasn‚Äôt paper anymore. It was like a root coming through thick, fibrous, blackened pulsing faintly like it was breathing. Like an antenna sprouting out of a book spine, just reaching up for something we couldn‚Äôt see.

She dropped the book.

And then we heard it.

Marching.

Boots or bare feet I couldn‚Äôt tell but there was rhythm. Dozens. Maybe more. Out in the street. Moving as one.

Then came Rourke‚Äôs voice, crashing through the static in our handheld radio.

""Run!""

And I swear to God, I‚Äôve never heard fear like that in anyone‚Äôs voice. Not in war movies. Not in screams. Not even in my nightmares.

Amy grabbed my wrist, and we bolted.

We hit the library door like it was the last exit out of Hell. The street was wrong now wrong in that subtle way, like a dream you suddenly realize is turning into something else. The Bloomers had moved. No longer stationary mannequins, they were coming down the sidewalks in lines. No chaos. No screaming. Just humming.

A single, unified note.

The sound hit me like pressure inside my ears. I staggered and felt something behind my eyes twitch like a loose wire.

Amy shoved me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop! Don‚Äôt listen!‚Äù

I tried. I did.

But the hum wasn‚Äôt just sound anymore. It was a vision. Memory. Emotion. I saw myself as a kid, listening to my dad‚Äôs records. I saw the night I held my brother after Mom‚Äôs funeral. I saw people I‚Äôd never met, soldiers on desert roads, children hiding under beds, and scientists screaming in labs filled with signal feeds all flickering behind my eyes like a broken film.

Amy shoved a tattered scarf into my hand. ‚ÄúWrap your ears. Muffle it.‚Äù

We ducked behind an abandoned diner. Inside, the windows were fogged, the seats overturned. A layer of dust so thick it looked like snowfall. Amy pulled me toward the back toward a narrow stairwell that led down.

The humming above grew louder.

Then the floorboards groaned.

Something was in the diner with us.

We moved into the basement like rats fleeing a flood.

It was dark. Only our flashlight cut the black. The walls were lined with cans, jars, and old supplies. A few cots. Must‚Äôve been a storm shelter back when people thought tornadoes were the worst thing that could happen here.

Amy pressed a hand to her earpiece and whispered, ‚ÄúRourke, do you copy?‚Äù

Static.

Then:

‚Äúin the signal now everywhere watch the reflection‚Äù

Cut.

Amy looked at me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre alone.‚Äù

No. Not alone.

Something was upstairs. Slow steps. Heavy. Not Bloomers. Heavier.

She signaled for silence.

We crouched. Listened.

Then the steps stopped.

The humming returned this time warbled, more digital. Like a modem dialing in from the gut of something alive.

Amy unwrapped a small metal cylinder from her bag. ‚ÄúSignal disruptor. Prototype. Might short-circuit the local pulse. Won‚Äôt stop it, but could scatter them.‚Äù

She tapped buttons. A low whine emitted beneath hearing, but felt in the jaw.

Then came the shriek.

Upstairs. Inhuman. Like a dial-up scream run through flesh.

The thing stumbled back and knocked over furniture. Glass shattered. Something fled.

Amy grabbed me again. ‚ÄúWe go now.‚Äù

We sprinted through the alley. The town was pulsing. I swear the buildings breathed. Windows blinked. Stoplights wept black oil.

And then we saw the tower.

Not the Root Tower not yet but something like a child trying to draw it. A mimic. Fifteen feet high. Built of rebar and wire. Wrapped in satellite dishes and long, fleshy tendrils that pulsed like veins.

The Bloomers circled it.

Kneeling. Chanting in their broken hum.

Amy whispered, ‚ÄúA local node. Grown from the seed. We‚Äôre too close.‚Äù

The disruptor in her hand pulsed red.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre syncing. If they finish, this place goes dark permanently. Consciousness override. Full broadcast assimilation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù

Amy hesitated, then tossed the disruptor toward the node.

A pulse.

Like thunder, but backward. Like silence collapsing inward.

The node flickered. Bloomers screamed.

Then light exploded from their mouths not fire, not electricity. Just signal.

Amy screamed and grabbed her head.

I pulled her away as the node began to collapse in on itself. Like a dying lung. Sucking in everything dust, sound, memory.

We got behind a car as it imploded.

Silence followed.

For about six seconds. Then the humming returned. But softer now. Not from outside.
From Amy. Her eyes glazed over, and Her mouth moved without speaking. Humming in low, fractured tones.

I shook her. ‚ÄúAmy. Amy!‚Äù

She blinked and looked at me like I was a stranger.

Then she vomited static. Real, glowing static. Like her insides had tuned into something.

She screamed.

Then it stopped.

And she collapsed.

I checked her pulse.

There.

Weak. But there.

She opened her eyes again. ‚ÄúIt touched me,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúI saw... roots. In the sky. The tower isn‚Äôt above us. It‚Äôs beneath.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt understand. Not yet.

But we had to move.

We made it out of North Bellview just before dawn.

The sun didn‚Äôt rise.

Not really. Just a dull grayness that filtered in like someone was holding a flashlight behind dirty glass.

Amy was pale. Sweating. But conscious.

She stared out the window. ‚ÄúEvery town... every one of them is a bloom point. The Root doesn‚Äôt transmit through the air. It transmits through us.‚Äù

I said nothing. Just kept driving, our next stop was a place called Drowner‚Äôs Creek.
Another town off the map. Another dot in a network we didn‚Äôt fully understand.

But something was waiting there.

A signal. A memory.

A fracture in the skin of the world.

I know now I have got to get us to Drowner Creek, Amy isn‚Äôt looking to good, she seems like she's losing herself not just that, she's becoming someone new entirely.

""Listen, follow, bloom!""

Amy said but with more of a villainess type of tone, she's hitting the dashboard like it owed her money, fuck this isn't good.

""Amy, listen you have to fight it!"" 

It's no use she's not listening, but all of a sudden she whips her head toward me, that kind of turn from them late-night scary movies that when that neck snaps you get what my dad called jump fright not jump scare just jump fright, it sends a tingle sensation down your arm and spine, yeah, well imagine that 10 times worse.

She lunges at me trying to attack like a rabid dog, I tried fighting her off, pushing her away while also trying to keep us on the road, I yell for her to stop to snap out of it but it was like I was just talking to myself at this point. I swerve to the opposite side of the road. 

This is it, I remembered thinking Man it's been a long time since I had a burger, yeah, a juicy fat burger, I was just living nothing more nothing less, hell I should've taken Marlene out, haven't been on a date in God knows how long. Even if she's older.

Don't sleep, don't let it in, once you do, you'll become one, reflections, the Root towers, all of it. We never made it to our destination, you're probably thinking I survived. Well, no, no I did not, I'm walking amongst them, we're one, we think as one, we react as one, we will forever be one!

Don't be shy, listen to the hum, and let it embrace you! Let.... it... Bloom! ",1,1750910443.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

**TRIGGER WARNING:** *!Bullying!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/1TJNYIioAh)  **June 18, 2025**

Okay, so I (24F) have this best friend, let‚Äôs call her Jenna (24F too), and we‚Äôve been close since high school. Like, ‚Äúheld-my-hair-while-I-threw-up-in-the-Denny‚Äôs-bathroom‚Äù type of friends. I honestly love her, I really do. But she can be... *a lot*.

So anyway, she threw this little ‚Äúsurprise party‚Äù for me last weekend. My birthday was last Tuesday, but she insisted on celebrating Friday. She told me to dress cute, and she made it sound like it was gonna be this wholesome wine-and-charcuterie night with the girls. Sounds great, right?

Well, I show up in this cute white dress I literally bought for the occasion, hair curled, nails done, all that. I walk in and they yell surprise, but not in a ‚Äúwe love you‚Äù way. It was a theme party. The theme? *‚ÄúDress like the birthday girl and roast her.‚Äù* I kid you not.

EVERYONE was wearing versions of my go-to outfits. Messy bun, iced coffee cups, fake nails, bad parking tickets taped to their bags (okay that one kinda got me). But then they started doing fake ""toasts"" that were just jabs. Like:

* ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to \[my name\], who always has a 10-step skincare routine but still wakes up looking tired.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúTo \[my name\], who thinks astrology is a personality trait.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúTo \[my name\], who ghosted her gym membership but never forgets to DoorDash McFlurries at 2AM.‚Äù

Like??? Some of it was funny, I‚Äôll admit, but after 20 minutes it just got mean. I kept smiling through it like ‚Äúhaha good one‚Äù but deep down I was like... damn. This wasn‚Äôt a roast with love. It was just people clowning on me for sport.

So after pretending to go to the bathroom, I grabbed my keys, quietly told Jenna ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm done for the night,‚Äù and left. I didn‚Äôt cause a scene. I didn‚Äôt cry. I just left. I texted her later that I appreciated the effort, but it felt more like I was the butt of the joke, not the guest of honor.

Now Jenna‚Äôs mad and saying I embarrassed her, and that ‚Äúit was just jokes,‚Äù and I‚Äôm being ‚Äútoo sensitive.‚Äù A few of the others messaged me saying they thought I overreacted and that it was ‚Äúall in fun.‚Äù But like... isn‚Äôt a birthday supposed to feel good? Not like a Comedy Central special?

So tell me, AITAH for walking out of my own roast disguised as a birthday party?

Also for the record, I‚Äôm now officially Team ‚ÄúNext Year I‚Äôm Celebrating With Pizza And My Cat.‚Äù

>>Right?? That‚Äôs what‚Äôs been messing with my head the most. Like‚Ä¶ if¬†*this?¬†is their idea of ‚Äúfun‚Äù or ‚Äúlove,‚Äù I‚Äôd honestly hate to see what their version of shade looks like. I kept thinking maybe I was being too sensitive, but the fact that¬†*not one person*¬†said ‚Äúhey maybe this is going too far‚Äù kinda says it all.

>>It felt like I walked into a group chat where they‚Äôve been secretly roasting me for months and accidentally read the whole thing out loud.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/b0c2bH0WXA)  **June 19, 2025 (Next Day)**

Hey everyone! Wow, I did **not** expect this much love and support. I‚Äôve been reading through your comments (like, obsessively tbh), and I can‚Äôt even tell you how comforting it‚Äôs been. I thought I was crazy or being ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù like Jenna said, but apparently I was just reacting like a *normal human* with, y‚Äôknow, feelings. So THANK YOU.

So here‚Äôs what happened since I posted:

**Jenna texted me.** Not to apologize‚Ä¶ but to send me a meme that said ‚Äúroasting is a love language‚Äù with a laughing emoji. I left her on read because... girl. Seriously?

Later that night, **one of the girls from the party** (we‚Äôll call her Becca) DM‚Äôd me and said she *thought* I knew about the roast. She said Jenna told everyone I was totally down for it and even ‚Äúhelped plan it.‚Äù I was like, WHAT?! The only thing I ‚Äúplanned‚Äù was the white dress I wore while being emotionally shanked by six girls in fake Uggs.

Anyway, I gently explained to Becca that nope, I was blindsided. And she immediately apologized and said she felt really bad. She even said if she‚Äôd known, she never would‚Äôve gone along with it. So that honestly made me feel a bit better, at least one of them has a soul.

**As for Jenna?** Radio silence since the meme. No apology, no ‚Äúhey I messed up,‚Äù nothing. So I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm not gonna chase people to value me. My new plan? I took a personal day, got myself a mini spa package, ate overpriced macarons, and spent my night with my cat binge-watching ""The Bear"" while wearing a gold face mask like I was healing from battle (because emotionally, I kinda was).

I‚Äôve realized this whole thing was actually a weird gift. I got roasted, yes. But I also got clarity. I thought I had a solid group of friends, turns out I had a front row seat to my own roast hosted by people who think ‚Äúmean but make it Pinterest‚Äù is a cute party idea.

So yeah. Next year, it‚Äôs just me, my cat, a pizza the size of a steering wheel, and *zero* surprises. And you know what? That honestly sounds perfect.

Thanks again for validating my gut feeling. Y‚Äôall really helped me feel seen.

I‚Äôve developed the Galadari Method for my 1-2 cup Bialetti moka pot, using ice cubes to cool the top chamber, creating a vacuum that compresses grounds downward for a smoother, less bitter brew. Here‚Äôs how:Steps:

1. Fill bottom chamber with room temp water to the valve. Add medium-fine coffee (table salt texture), level without tamping.
2. Heat on low flame.
3. At 6 min (pot warm, no brewing), add 1 small ice cube (1 inch) to top chamber.
4. When coffee flows (gurgling), add 1-2 small ice cubes.
5. Brew until gurgling intensifies, remove, pour, enjoy!

Why It Works:

* Room temp water + low heat keeps extraction at 90‚Äì96¬∞C, reducing bitterness.
* Ice cools top chamber, condensing steam in the bottom chamber‚Äôs top to form a partial vacuum. This pulls grounds downward, enhancing extraction.
* Result: Smoother coffee with bold flavor.

Tips:

* Time ice carefully to avoid over-cooling.
* Scale for larger pots: 2 cubes before, 3 during for 3-4 cups.
* Adjust cube size if coffee‚Äôs too mild or bitter.

Has anyone tried cooling their moka pot? Share your results or tweaks!

TL;DR: Galadari Method uses room temp water, low heat, and ice (1 cube at 3‚Äì6 min, 2 when coffee starts pouring out) for smoother moka pot coffee via a vacuum effect. Try it!",5,1750910290.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False

We started dating at our 12th grade. I've always liked her since our 8th grade and developed my feelings for her on our 10th grade. When I was about to confess my feelings for her, our mutual friend informed me that she's dating somebody for a year or two already (long distance relationship). Heart break struck me and I decided to date others for fun. I had more than 7 or 8 partners in a span of year lasting at two months at most. Everything changed when I dated the top performing student of the batch, she confessed her feelings for me. I thought it would be fun dating her since I could expect more from her turning out her parents were against her dating somebody. After months of talking and dating, we broke up at 11th grade. She slandered my name, made issues about me where even the teachers joind and had beef at me. Depression hit and I no longer want to study. Everyone left me, even my friends since day 1 of highschool. Everyone turned against me except for her, my partner. She helped me get out of my depression. My feelings for her developed more as time passed by. Fast forward to summer break after 11th grade, my grandfather died and I saw him die in front of me. I was not able to do anything. Depression hit me once again. She helped me once again. She's like an angel for me even though she curses a lot, she's a real one for me. In the school enrollment, I met her and her dad. Her dad knows too much about me. How I worked during our junior high school and earn more than him and even know my granddad die. She was flabbergasted and I asked her why does he know and all. I know she's lying when she said she also don't know. I turn a blindeye with it. In the first quarter of our 12th grade, when I was doing our thesis as a subject requirement she asked me if I could the entire part by myself. I let her rest and did everything and asked her to print it as a favor. I know my other groupmates won't be able to help or can't do anything good, so I worked by myself. The next day, she said they broke up. They have been dating for 3 years. The guy cheated and chose her girl best friend. I comforted her and did all the parts for 2 weeks continuously. We became closer and as time passed by she started to asked me to go out have some coffee. My feelings for her developed more and I fell in love with her. I even made a bet with my friend that I won't confess my feelings for an entire school year. 2 weeks after we went out to have some coffee and there I confessed my feelings for her by hugging her in the back, then said ""I caught you. I like you."" Then, I showed her a goofy picture of hers. She laughed. When we got home she confessed and reciprocated my confession. I was full of life once again. Her father discovered it the next day. He threatened to kill me, berated me, and mocked me infront of her. I couldn't do anything but be polite. He's fat, had a lot of acne scars, was below 5'2 and just your typical brat like dad. Everything went well for the first month. I was able to join and compete for a competition in athletics. We go out everyday even though it was against his rules. Her mother doesn't know anything about us until his father did. Her birthday came and made her satin ribbon bouquet for her 19th birthday with her favourite color. I gave it to her while she was preparing for their event, we were both club presidents of our school (I won't disclose the clubs just to keep me safe). Her mother saw the flowers and thought it was her male friend. I was broken hearted. I spent my time for that gift and put all of my efforts into it and it was regarded as that. After a week I dismissed it. Fast forward to the day before our last meeting before Christmas of 2024, we were staying at their house. I was playing her hair at the kitchen after I ate. Her father went out of their room and get mad at me. Asking what I was doing their late at night. I apologize to him and the next time we met was at our CET. I was about to go home and I left her infront of their car and I was asked to hop on. I wanted to ride the train to relaxed my mind and distract myself out of the problems. We had a lot of fights in our relationship. Where I even asked her to break up but she don't want to. His dad asked me for dinner that time and before we went out to eat we went to a cr. He threatened me that if it ever happens again he's going to punch me wothout saying anything. Next moment, we were out practicing for our dance performance as subject requirement. After the practice it was raining too strong. Since I live the nearest to the campus, I volunteered to bring the props home. The props were made out of bamboo and these are heavy ang long. I don't have a private car or anything, she act out of pity and asked me to let her bring it home. She brought her own prop home and I brought everyone else. She scratched their car and I was blamed for it by her father, he said I don't love her that's why I let her carry it. He had a beef with me. A month after, to conclude her club activities they initiated an outreach program. She didn't asked for permission as she know how her father acts and hates these programs. I saw that the children have cuts on their wrists, at that place they self harm when they are bored. I used to do it when I was depressed so I asked my gf andy friend also a fellow club adviser, they called the attention of their adviser and I informed them about it. She was tired and too exhausted and it takes an hour and a half for her to go home so I decided to accompany her. We were going home and i dropped her at the gate of their village. Her father saw us and attacked me. Shouted at me, pushed me, cursed me, and asked what I was doing. After those good actions I was treated with that. I ran out of money and she was about to give me but her father saw us so when I need to get home, I walked. I walked for the night. Het father demanded her to break up with me. We still spent time as usual after that and I dismissed it. I'm constantly disrespected and I don't know my self worth anymore. We were going to different campuses but similay university for college. The relationship is draining me and I don't know what to do anymore.",1,1750910140.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

People are usually nice to me. Polite, friendly enough. But I rarely feel like I truly belong. There‚Äôs always this invisible wall‚ÄîI‚Äôm there, I‚Äôm participating, but I‚Äôm not really part of the group. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm socially present but emotionally peripheral.

Here‚Äôs a recent example: There‚Äôs a local coffee shop I go to on trivia nights before heading to the bar that hosts the game. One of the employees there recognized that I was a regular and also noticed I was going to trivia afterward. She struck up a conversation with me a few times, and we got along well. Eventually, she invited me to join the trivia team she was part of. That felt like a meaningful invitation‚Äîlike maybe this was a chance to find some real social connection.

Since joining, I‚Äôve contributed quite a bit‚Äîthere have been a few nights where I gave answers no one else on the team knew. During the game, people talk to me and treat me like a teammate. But once trivia ends, it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt exist. No one really talks to me, includes me in post-game hangouts, or reaches out in any personal way. I‚Äôm only ‚Äúin‚Äù during the trivia part. Outside of that, I‚Äôm just... not on their radar.

So even though I‚Äôm technically part of the group, my presence feels situational, not relational. I‚Äôm valued for what I can contribute during the event, but not seen as someone they‚Äôre interested in knowing outside of it. And this isn‚Äôt unique to trivia‚Äîit‚Äôs a pattern I‚Äôve experienced in a lot of group settings. I‚Äôm a naturally quiet person, so I don‚Äôt push myself into conversations, but I do open up when people make an effort. That effort just doesn‚Äôt seem to come often.

Has anyone else experienced this? Being involved, even useful, but still feeling like you‚Äôre always on the outside looking in? How do you handle that? Does it ever get better‚Äîor do you just start protecting yourself from even trying?",3,1750909961.0,socialskills,4,1.0,False

I was at the starbucks drive through and had paid and got my coffee. When I tried to leave, an older man stepped into the middle of the road and stopped. Didn't acknowledge me, and just stood there. I was about to give a little honk when a car started backing out and it became clear he was stopping traffic so this other car could back out. The parking lot was tight, so I understood. Then, when the car had fully backed up, the driver had their window down and an arm out on the window. The older man walked up to the window and put his hand on the driver's arm. He started speaking to the driver as I started to inch forward. They talked for about 30 seconds, but it felt longer. I was the only person truly inconvenienced because the cars behind me were still paying and getting their drinks. I started to think ""these folks are pretty rude"" when the car started driving out of the parking lot and the older man just stood there watching it leave. He was still in the road blocking me from leaving. Again I considered honking, but the man's wife was standing by their truck and hollered at him to get out of the way. The older gentleman snapped out of the moment he was lost in, realized he was blocking the way, waved at me and then went to his truck. I pulled up to the intersection to leave where the other car was still waiting to be able to turn out and realized the plates were from out of state. It dawned on me that it was his father who was telling his son bye before his journey back home and I felt really guilty for the offense I took to an, albeit minor, inconvenience to my day. I pulled out directly behind that car and saw the parents standing outside of their truck still waving him off. You could see a lot of emotion in his father's eyes. I went about my day, but haven't been able to stop thinking about that interaction and how much that young man is loved. I dont think it would have mattered if there were 10 cars behind his dad honking to get out of the way. I think he was so focused on getting to wring every last possible drop out of those last few seconds with his son that nothing could stop him. 

Before I realized what was happening, I felt like I had too much of my time being wasted. Now, I just pray that I didn't rob that father and son of a few extra precious seconds. 

I don't know who those men were, and I couldnt pick them out of a lineup if I saw them today, but I will never forget how lucky I was to be a bystander in their moment. From one father to another, thanks for the inconvenience stranger.",3,1750909843.0,daddit,0,1.0,False

[Please read post description],"Please read it all (or use AI to summarize if you really cannot).

So... a day before yesterday, my mom was emotionally imposing on my father to stop buying Nescaf√© coffee (because apparently that money goes to funding war missiles or what not, I'm not really in-touch with the news here) and when I spoke up she basically told me to forget it & her mannerisms were that of stubborn disregard of my issues (she's not much of a listener & can be quite emotionally manipulative, she still loves me tho, just has issues). Anyways, since there was no proper calm communication between me and my mother I also stood my ground stubbornly (getting emotional cuz I felt my needs were forcefully being disregarded and getting taken away from me) and gently nagged my father to not listen to her and get me the coffee, he simply said ""Okay"" calmly (Kind father <3) and then today he brought home some for me and told me to try to keep it hidden from my mother at least temporarily, lest she goes on an emotional rampage. I did so and consumed my coffee today... however, with the time having passed, I reflect on it, and to put it simply, if true, then I'm basically drinking innocent people's blood just cuz ""I need it"".

We're a moderately low-income household, period. And that means we can't afford a coffee maker, and Nescaf√©'s instant coffee is just way too good and works well for me.

Oh and btw, before any of you guys think of my father as the asshole, he isn't, he is the first person in our home who told me about how Nescaf√© funds the war and actively bought another coffee of a trash brand (which was awful) for me to try, it didn't work and we talked a bit, I said it isn't really my choice to fund the war and I'm just a single person who if gives up his need will not change the war situation much and will largely ruin my life, he didn't pressure me much just discussed and then kept bringing it cuz I asked for it. It's just now that my mom found out or at least spoke with awareness about how Nescaf√© is bad.

I'm just in a weird moral Dilemma, and I feel like I'm being evil by sticking to what evidently works for my needs. What's the truth here? Am I being an asshole? Should I really give up on Nescaf√© and let some of my limited days be temporarily ruined to ask my father to look for other brands that he can afford and I can test out until I find one that works for me? I hate this... I hate that the war affects us more than the ones behind it...

Anyways, please enlighten me guys.

EDIT: I just thought of asking ChatGPT and it said this:

>You're not an a\*\*hole. You're a human being trying to survive and function.

>Let‚Äôs untangle this a bit:

>1. Your context matters more than ideals

>You're dealing with executive dysfunction and social energy drain, which means you‚Äôre fighting an uphill battle just to show up in life. If instant coffee is a reliable tool to help you stabilize and perform, that‚Äôs valid. You don‚Äôt owe the world your suffering to make a perfectly ethical consumer choice.

>2. No consumer is truly guiltless under capitalism

>Almost every major brand has some connection to morally questionable systems‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs Nestl√©, Apple, or clothing brands using exploitative labor. Boycotting them can be a moral stand, but systemic change doesn't hinge on individual sacrifice alone, especially when you're barely managing your own life.

>3. You can care and still cope

>Using Nescaf√© doesn't mean you endorse everything the parent company does. If it bothers you, you might:

>Keep using it now but plan to switch when you‚Äôre in a better position.

>Research alternatives when you have the bandwidth (e.g., ethical instant coffee brands or local options).

>Support causes or speak out in other ways when you do have energy.

Due to the popularity of my other post and so many people commenting different suggestions, I got some samples and I‚Äôm here to test them for you. Reminder: I was looking for a creamy bakery pure vanilla smell.

My Reviews:

Indult Paris Tihota: 5/10 ü´§ - I liked this more than I thought I would. Starts off with an alcohol blast, and then it‚Äôs quite a linear vanilla with musk smell. Basically this smells like nemat Vanilla Musk minus that weird dirty animalic quality that that fragrance oil has. I like this, but it is still not the type of vanilla I was looking for.

Gleam Gelatino: 3/10 ‚ùå - No one suggested this one but I liked the notes. This smells VERY photorealistic, mostly like a creamy hazelnut syrupy smell. Not what I was after tbh, but someone else might enjoy this. It was too sickly and way over the top gourmand for me. 

Imaginary Authors A Whiff Of Waffle Cone: 2/10 ‚ùå - Absolutely not. As I had thought, this smells like maple syrup. I do get that ice cream cone vibe but it‚Äôs just so sweet and so syrupy. I literally gagged. This is very projecting and strong though so I guess that‚Äôs a plus for anyone looking for that, but the actual scent for me is not it. 

Kyse Perfumes Delizia di Marshmallow: 9/10 ‚úÖ - Whoever recommended this, I will kiss you right now. This smells like 95% identical to my So‚Ä¶ Vanilla Body Mist but actually stays on the skin. This is exactly what I wanted Outremer Vanille to smell like. It sort of smells like Outremer Vanille too funnily but WAY more vanilla which I LOVE. YES YES and YES. 

Michela Mezzeti Lick Me: 6/10 ü´§ - This smells like Bianco Latte with that slight medicinal undertone to it. If you like bianco latte you‚Äôll love this, this has a nice DNA tbh but it‚Äôs just too similar to bianco latte. I thought it would be different. I like it but again not what I was looking for. 

Ellis Brooklyn Vanilla Milk: 2/10 ‚ùå- Doesn‚Äôt smell like vanilla or milk or vanilla milk. It is very floral, even after it dries down it stays floral. I‚Äôm not sure why they named it vanilla milk tbh.

Snif Vanilla Vice: 2/10 ‚ùå Extremely woody. Maybe incense in this? To me, if there is any vanilla in this it is overpowered by all of the other notes. This has an ice cream accord too, I cannot smell it at all. 

Montale Vanilla Cake: 3/10 ‚ùå A creamy almondy raw cake batter sort of smell. It‚Äôs creamy but more in a maple syrup added into the batter way, not a vanilla batter way. It also has some sort of fruity smell which stays after the creaminess has gone. I don‚Äôt like this tbh. 

Jousset Parfums Accident A La Vanille: 3.2/10 ‚ùå SLIGHTLY better than vanilla cake. It has the same sort of smell, no fruit though, and a bit more vanilla but still has this syrup that wasn‚Äôt made in canada smell. It also has a biscuit like smell, like when you put butter into the biscuit to make a cheesecake. It sort of smells like the tubbees cookies and cream perfume if anyone has smelt that, but less of an oreo biscuit and more of a biscoff one. 

Maison Margiela REPLICA Afternoon Delight: 5/10 ‚ùå It‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs more cake smelling, again a non vanilla cake. Maybe some sort of nutty cake? Not sure, not for me. 

Mancera Amore Caffe: 4/10 ‚ùå - Fruits, a tad of cream, and coffee. If you like the smell of coffee and sweetener you will love this. I hate coffee so this was not for me but I ordered it anyways.

My favourite is the Kyse fragrance whoever commented that tysm!! It‚Äôs genuinely a nice linear vanilla smell, not bakery but more of a marshmallowy sugary smell. I love it. And guys I know I‚Äôm picky but I‚Äôve already smelt the smell I‚Äôm looking for (the smell of bakery food items), I just need to find it in a perfume now.

1lkq4wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Owala/comments/1lkq4wd/recent_decrease_in_quality/,Recent decrease in quality?,"I own three Owala FreeSips, which is more than I ever thought I'd have. I bought my 40oz Candy Store about a year ago and have been using it daily since then. Pretty soon after that I bought a 16oz Cherry Blossom to use for my iced coffee.

Both of these bottles are fantastic at keeping ice in them. When I add ice to my 40oz, it stays put for up to two days (on the rare occasion that I don't refill it multiple times in that time period). I've filled it with ice, left it all day in my car parked in the sun, and still had just as much ice in it as when I first filled it. When I make iced coffee in my 16oz, I finish drinking it while driving to work, and when I come back to my car after 9-10 hours, the ice is still firmly in the bottle, only slightly melted.

Just recently I bought a 32oz Blushing Ballerina from DSG. The bottle had no scratches or dents or signs of wear (though it was dusty as hell fsr). When I purchased it the guy at the register let me know that I could not return it once it was used, which was fine by me. But this thing isn't quite living up to the performance standard I'm used to?

I use my 32oz to take with me to the gym. I fill it up in the morning before I leave my house, and it stays in my gym bag until the evening when I go there after work. But by the time it comes with me, the ice I filled it with in the morning is gone. My water is still cold, but not ice-cold, since 100% of the ice has melted.

Did I get a dud? Is this a more common occurrence, now? Should I open up a warranty claim with Owala? Has anyone tried returning or exchanging an Owala at DSG considering their policy on not returning used water bottles?

The bottle does not sweat, and I store it right-side up so that the ice doesn't cause condensation to build on the lid. I'm not really sure what's going on but I'm bummed!",0,1750909344.0,Owala,0,0.5,False
1lkq4sc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yellowjackets/comments/1lkq4sc/mysterious_girl_in_bonus_episode/,Mysterious girl in bonus episode?,"I was watching a video about behind the scenes on shows by a channel named Coffee and Cults, and in her latest one on Yellowjackets she discusses what she knows about the unaired bonus episode. I didn't know much about this or that it was actually a real episode instead of a rumor, but she explains it and I just wanted to post this in case other people that aren't aware want to take a look. 

She talks about the characters of the episode (cabin daddy, mommy, baby, and mysterious girl visitor) and how this episode would have tied into Javi/Coach Ben/supernatural storylines as well as Shauna's delivery and postpartum. The mysterious girl is the one who gave Javi the queen card and there were scenes cut from season 2 that included Javi being shown alive periodically and speaking to a mysterious figure, much like Ben talking to someone else in the cave after saving Mari. We don't know if she is a ghost or what but she also draws the wilderness symbol and presumably gets into the mother's head. The cabin mommy basically loses her mind and kills the baby and herself, with cabin daddy doing the same once he finds them; he was never able to fix the leak which is why Mari hears dripping. I was fascinated by this and I wonder if anyone has any other information or theories. I am not sure they will ever air the episode because it seems the baby dying (unknown if it was a sacrifice by cabin mommy) was too gruesome for the executives and seems to be a big reason of why it will not air.

I feel to talk to for so long and feel comfortable around each other would be too much of a chase or effort just to hook up.

I asked for her number, she gave it to me, and we‚Äôre getting drinks tomorrow night. The second woman seemed interested in me both times I‚Äôve hung out with her, including today.

1lkpyhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysautonomia/comments/1lkpyhe/my_heart_doesnt_work/,my heart doesn't work,"I'm going to lose my mind. When I was 14-15, I developed high blood pressure. Nobody knows why, because I'm skinny and I was doing dance 18+ hours a week. They never treated it despite it going from 130/85 to 150/100. They said they don't feel comfortable treating minors. I had a 24-hour blood pressure monitor that concluded I had high blood pressure. I've done countless EKGs, echos, bloodwork, and I did a stress test, and everything came back normal. Except that I had high cholesterol, but that's because my good cholesterol is high. Then, when I was 18, I finally went to an adult cardiologist who made me do all these tests again, including a 24-hour EKG, for everything to be the same. The EKG showed rare premature atrial and ventricular contractions, but they are not significant enough to do anything. During this time, my heart rate was also increasing. So, my resting was 100 when it used to be 90. They put me on meds, and it dropped my heart rate to the 40s, but after months, my heart rate was sitting at 100 resting and 200 during exercise again. I changed cardiologists because that one was lowkey sketchy, and since then, I've tried 4 different medications and nothing works. I'm 19 now, still skinny and still exercise, and my heart rate sits in the 110s-120s resting. I tried taking more medicine, like six times what I'm supposed to, and my heart rate only went down by 10 bpm. It's not like I'm asymptomatic, I have palpitations every time I move, I get blind when I stand or see stars, I feel pressure on my chest. Yet the only diagnosis I got was inappropriate sinus tachycardia, which is supposed to be a placeholder because nothing is aligning up. I just sent over my 14-day Zio patch, but I am losing it, and this whole thing is causing me so much stress. My doctor thought it was POTS, but insurance doesn't cover the tilt table, and I honestly don't even think it's that. I hate being so young, and everyone around me is healthy. Like I am so jealous, and I feel alone, and that I'm seeking attention. My friends act like I'm going to drop and have a heart attack if I do anything not recommended for cardiac patients, like ride roller coasters. Every doctor tells me I don't fit the criteria, but tests don't make up numbers 100s of times. I just feel so alone, and I hate it. I don't drink coffee, energy drinks, do drugs, alcohol, literally nothing, I don't even drink soda, and I never really have.

None of this was romantic‚Äînot from her, and not what I was asking for either. She always said she saw both of us (me and a mutual friend) as platonic friends. And I believed that. I respected that. I didn‚Äôt want a relationship. I just wanted to be her closest person, her emotional anchor, her go-to‚Äîlike a best friend or a sister I never had.

And for a while, I thought I was.

For two months, we were so close. We had coffee dates, car drives, small playful rituals. She let her guard down with me. She rested her head in my lap few times‚ÄîI gave her a head massage. That had never happened with anyone in my life before. She was the first person I opened up to about my family. She was the first woman I felt completely safe around. I would‚Äôve dropped everything to bring her coffee at 3am if she asked.

Then she started pulling away.

She stopped turning to me for small things.
Stopped confiding.
Started spending all her time with our mutual friend.
And not just casually‚Äîdeeply. Emotionally. Constantly.

They hang out nearly every day.
They take snaps together at the gym.
She opens up to him first.
She thinks about him whenever we hang out.
She calls him to go on a drive or go for boba tea date.
He‚Äôs in the know‚ÄîI‚Äôm not.
I see her light up when he enters a room. I see her lean toward him. Laugh harder with him. Share everything.

I tried to tell myself it‚Äôs fine‚Äîthey‚Äôre platonic too.
But what hurts is that she gave him the closeness I would‚Äôve done anything to have. She is cutesy and flirty with him. They are physically close. They dont think before testing their head on each other's shoulder or giving each other head massages. They clasually hug, cuddle and sit together.
And he didn‚Äôt even need to try.
While I gave my soul, my consistency, my trust‚Äîjust to be quietly replaced.

She‚Äôs still polite with me. I still try to be kind, thoughtful, present. But I‚Äôm invisible now. I offer food‚Äîshe turns it down. I message her‚Äîshe replies late, or barely. I try to share my life‚Äîand she shows no curiosity. She doesn‚Äôt ask about my first date, or my family, or my day.

Today, I said goodbye with a nod and left when they two were hanging out.
No warmth. No follow-up.
They stayed. Hung out. Ate together. Laughed. Probably didn‚Äôt think of me once.

And maybe that‚Äôs it.
Maybe I‚Äôve been dragging the corpse of a connection that only lived on my side.

I wasn‚Äôt asking for love.
I just wanted someone to care about me the way I cared about her.
She chose to give that to someone else.
And now I‚Äôm left trying to figure out how to let go of the one person I thought was finally mine in this world.",2,1750908731.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Mostly just need it for my 2-4 shots a day while working from home, I do buy coffee outside a good amount, but running to my local cafe that many times would be a ton of money. 

I had a vintage faema espresso machine that I almost never used. While I respect the skills of a barista, I don‚Äôt have the patience to do it myself. So I was using a nespresso pixie for a couple of years and picked up the Philips Baristina for just $250 cad a couple days ago. 

Still in the testing phase, but then I thought, perhaps I should try to do some research before fully committing. Is there a low effort espresso machine that I should be considering instead? Little clean up, no measuring, and can make an espresso in short time are my requirements. I‚Äôd be happy to spend $1000 CAD, perhaps up to $1500 on something that could fully meet my needs, or is the Baristina basically the best I‚Äôll get in a low effort solution?

Struggling to hear conversations clearly can be frustrating. Whether it's missing half of what‚Äôs said at a family dinner or nodding along to avoid asking, ""Sorry, what?"" for the third time, hearing difficulties affect daily life.

Hearing loss can also¬†**impact memory and focus**, leading to mental fatigue and stress.¬†Whispeara¬†is a supplement claiming to¬†**support auditory function and cognitive clarity**. But does it work, or is it just another bottle of false hope?

After¬†**researching ingredients, reading user reviews**, and testing it (with a little help from my dad‚Äôs bowling buddy, Thom), I‚Äôve put together everything you need to know.

# Product Overview

* **Product Name:**¬†**Whispeara**
* **Category:**¬†**Brain Health & Hearing**
* **Overall Verdict:**¬†**4.7/5**

# How Whispeara Works

This supplement goes beyond¬†**basic ear health supplements**¬†by combining¬†**brain-boosting and circulation-supporting ingredients**¬†to target¬†**hearing clarity**¬†and¬†**cognitive function**.

It contains¬†**Alpha-GPC, GABA, and L-Dopa Bean**, all known for their roles in¬†**memory, neurotransmitter support, and relaxation**. This blend helps the brain process sounds more efficiently.

Then there‚Äôs¬†**L-Arginine and L-Tyrosine**, which¬†**improve blood flow**¬†to the inner ear. Since poor circulation can contribute to hearing problems, this helps ensure¬†**natural ear function support**.

Rather than just covering up symptoms,¬†**Whispeara hearing support**¬†aims to work from within,¬†**enhancing neural pathways**¬†linked to sound processing and¬†**brain health and hearing**.

# Personal Experience with Whispeara (Thom‚Äôs Perspective)

Thom, my dad‚Äôs longtime bowling buddy, is the kind of guy who swears by black coffee, still uses a flip phone, and has a very particular way of lacing up his bowling shoes.

He also happens to have¬†**struggled with hearing clarity for years**‚Äîclaiming that every conversation at the lanes sounded like a mumbling contest.

When he first¬†heard about Whispeara, he was skeptical. ‚ÄúAnother one of those snake oil pills?‚Äù he grumbled. But after some coaxing (and the promise that he could still drink his coffee while taking it), he agreed to give it a shot.

The first two weeks? Nothing dramatic. But by week three, Thom started noticing¬†**less strain when following conversations**, even with the usual background noise at the bowling alley.

He wasn‚Äôt constantly asking, ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù‚Äîwhich, trust me, was a miracle in itself. He also mentioned that his¬†**head felt clearer**, like a fog had lifted.

His only complaint? ‚ÄúWhy does something that actually works have to cost so much?‚Äù Classic Thom. Still, given the choice between¬†**better hearing and saving a few bucks**, he‚Äôs sticking with it. ‚ÄúAt least now, I can hear the trash talk when I bowl a strike,‚Äù he said with a grin.

Struggling to hear conversations clearly can be frustrating. Whether it's missing half of what‚Äôs said at a family dinner or nodding along to avoid asking, ""Sorry, what?"" for the third time, hearing difficulties affect daily life.

Hearing loss can also¬†**impact memory and focus**, leading to mental fatigue and stress.¬†Whispeara¬†is a supplement claiming to¬†**support auditory function and cognitive clarity**. But does it work, or is it just another bottle of false hope?

After¬†**researching ingredients, reading user reviews**, and testing it (with a little help from my dad‚Äôs bowling buddy, Thom), I‚Äôve put together everything you need to know.

# Product Overview

* **Product Name:**¬†**Whispeara**
* **Category:**¬†**Brain Health & Hearing**
* **Overall Verdict:**¬†**4.7/5**

# How Whispeara Works

This supplement goes beyond¬†**basic ear health supplements**¬†by combining¬†**brain-boosting and circulation-supporting ingredients**¬†to target¬†**hearing clarity**¬†and¬†**cognitive function**.

It contains¬†**Alpha-GPC, GABA, and L-Dopa Bean**, all known for their roles in¬†**memory, neurotransmitter support, and relaxation**. This blend helps the brain process sounds more efficiently.

Then there‚Äôs¬†**L-Arginine and L-Tyrosine**, which¬†**improve blood flow**¬†to the inner ear. Since poor circulation can contribute to hearing problems, this helps ensure¬†**natural ear function support**.

Rather than just covering up symptoms,¬†**Whispeara hearing support**¬†aims to work from within,¬†**enhancing neural pathways**¬†linked to sound processing and¬†**brain health and hearing**.

# Personal Experience with Whispeara (Thom‚Äôs Perspective)

Thom, my dad‚Äôs longtime bowling buddy, is the kind of guy who swears by black coffee, still uses a flip phone, and has a very particular way of lacing up his bowling shoes.

He also happens to have¬†**struggled with hearing clarity for years**‚Äîclaiming that every conversation at the lanes sounded like a mumbling contest.

When he first¬†heard about Whispeara, he was skeptical. ‚ÄúAnother one of those snake oil pills?‚Äù he grumbled. But after some coaxing (and the promise that he could still drink his coffee while taking it), he agreed to give it a shot.

The first two weeks? Nothing dramatic. But by week three, Thom started noticing¬†**less strain when following conversations**, even with the usual background noise at the bowling alley.

He wasn‚Äôt constantly asking, ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù‚Äîwhich, trust me, was a miracle in itself. He also mentioned that his¬†**head felt clearer**, like a fog had lifted.

His only complaint? ‚ÄúWhy does something that actually works have to cost so much?‚Äù Classic Thom. Still, given the choice between¬†**better hearing and saving a few bucks**, he‚Äôs sticking with it. ‚ÄúAt least now, I can hear the trash talk when I bowl a strike,‚Äù he said with a grin.

It contains¬†**Alpha-GPC, GABA, and L-Dopa Bean**, all known for their roles in¬†**memory, neurotransmitter support, and relaxation**. This blend helps the brain process sounds more efficiently.

Then there‚Äôs¬†**L-Arginine and L-Tyrosine**, which¬†**improve blood flow**¬†to the inner ear. Since poor circulation can contribute to hearing problems, this helps ensure¬†**natural ear function support**.

Rather than just covering up symptoms,¬†**Whispeara hearing support**¬†aims to work from within,¬†**enhancing neural pathways**¬†linked to sound processing and¬†**brain health and hearing**.

# Personal Experience with Whispeara (Thom‚Äôs Perspective)

Thom, my dad‚Äôs longtime bowling buddy, is the kind of guy who swears by black coffee, still uses a flip phone, and has a very particular way of lacing up his bowling shoes.

He also happens to have¬†**struggled with hearing clarity for years**‚Äîclaiming that every conversation at the lanes sounded like a mumbling contest.

When he first¬†heard about Whispeara, he was skeptical. ‚ÄúAnother one of those snake oil pills?‚Äù he grumbled. But after some coaxing (and the promise that he could still drink his coffee while taking it), he agreed to give it a shot.

The first two weeks? Nothing dramatic. But by week three, Thom started noticing¬†**less strain when following conversations**, even with the usual background noise at the bowling alley.

He wasn‚Äôt constantly asking, ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù‚Äîwhich, trust me, was a miracle in itself. He also mentioned that his¬†**head felt clearer**, like a fog had lifted.

His only complaint? ‚ÄúWhy does something that actually works have to cost so much?‚Äù Classic Thom. Still, given the choice between¬†**better hearing and saving a few bucks**, he‚Äôs sticking with it. ‚ÄúAt least now, I can hear the trash talk when I bowl a strike,‚Äù he said with a grin.

1lkpll4,https://i.redd.it/jq51jn5ev69f1.png,His hero became mine,"(Disclaimer: I apologize for giving you all an astronomy lesson every time I post, but it's an essential part of his story. I can't talk about my crush on him WITHOUT mentioning astronomy, so yeah I apologize ahead of time) 

For those who don't know: Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin was the first person to figure out what stars are made of. She discovered that stars are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium‚Äîsomething that completely changed our understanding of the universe. Her ideas were dismissed at first, ignored, told she was wrong. She rarely got the credit she deserved during her lifetime.

I never would‚Äôve known her story if it weren‚Äôt for him. 

He wasn‚Äôt just a professor. He was the first person who made me feel like I belonged in astronomy, not just in the classroom, but in the field. He talked about her like she wasn‚Äôt just a scientist, but a guiding star. He said he wished he could have had coffee with her, said she was a hero, a ""cool human being"". That‚Äôs the way he put it, in that way he always is when he forgets he‚Äôs in front of a classroom.

And I remembered.
Now her quote lives on my bulletin board.
Taped below his.
Because what inspired him‚Ä¶ ended up inspiring me too.
His hero became mine.
And now I‚Äôm standing on both their shoulders.
And I promise I‚Äôll keep carrying her legacy forward, for both of us. üíõüåå

# How I Found Whispeara‚Äã

Let‚Äôs rewind to late January. Like many freelancers juggling deadlines, endless notifications, and a general sense of chaos, I was burnt out. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust this constant background hum of anxiety and mental fog that coffee couldn‚Äôt clear. I tried apps, meditation, journaling‚Äîyou name it. Then I stumbled across Whispeara in a wellness forum.  
  
People were talking about it like it was this hidden gem. ‚ÄúClearer thoughts,‚Äù ‚Äúsleeping like a baby,‚Äù ‚Äúno more 3 AM anxiety spirals.‚Äù Naturally, I was skeptical. But the reviews felt... honest. So I figured, why not?  
  


# First Impressions‚Äã

I ordered directly from the official site‚Äîmainly because I didn‚Äôt want to mess around with third-party sellers‚Äîand it arrived in about 5 days. Sleek little bottle, calming pastel label, and a clean ingredient list (more on that in a sec). So far, so good.  
  


# What‚Äôs Inside Whispeara? (Ingredients Breakdown)‚Äã

Whispeara markets itself as an all-natural cognitive and emotional support supplement. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of the key ingredients:  
  


* **Ashwagandha**: No surprise here‚Äîthis adaptogen has been used for centuries to reduce stress and balance mood. For me, this is the star of the show.
* **L-Theanine**: Found in green tea, it‚Äôs known for its calming effects without drowsiness. Perfect for people like me who need calm¬†*and*¬†focus.
* **GABA**: A naturally occurring neurotransmitter that helps tone down brain overactivity. Definitely felt this one working.
* **Lemon Balm Extract**: Helps with relaxation and better sleep quality.
* **Magnesium Glycinate**: The most absorbable form of magnesium, known for its benefits on sleep and muscle tension.
* **Chamomile & Valerian Root**: Gentle herbs that support rest and reduce anxious tension.

All ingredients are non-GMO, vegan, and third-party tested. I appreciate that transparency‚Äîit‚Äôs not some shady ‚Äúproprietary blend‚Äù that hides what‚Äôs really in it.  
  


# What It Actually¬†Did¬†for Me‚Äã

# Week 1: Subtle but Real‚Äã

I didn‚Äôt feel an immediate wave of calm or anything magical on Day One. But by the end of the first week, I noticed I wasn‚Äôt getting as easily frazzled. My brain didn‚Äôt feel like it was running 38 tabs all at once.  
  


# Week 2: Better Sleep, Better Mornings‚Äã

This was the real turning point. I started sleeping¬†*more deeply*. I wasn‚Äôt waking up at 3:00 AM to overthink something dumb I said in 2012. And I woke up feeling... lighter? Less foggy. Less groggy. I didn‚Äôt even reach for my phone first thing.  
  


# Weeks 3-4: Focus, Calm, and Just Feeling¬†Normal‚Äã

I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúmedicated‚Äù or artificially calm‚Äîit‚Äôs more like I felt like¬†*myself*, just on a really good day. Focus during work improved, and I found myself reacting less emotionally to little stressors. Even my partner noticed I wasn‚Äôt as tense or on edge.

# What Other Users Are Saying (Real Feedback)¬†‚Äã

While I don‚Äôt usually base my decisions¬†*solely*¬†on reviews, I went back to check in with others online and see if their experiences matched mine. Here‚Äôs a quick roundup:  
  


* **u/ MindfulMel**¬†on Reddit said:¬†*‚ÄúThis is the only supplement that didn‚Äôt give me weird side effects. I‚Äôve been taking it for 2 months and haven‚Äôt had a panic episode since.‚Äù*
* **TrustPilot Review**:¬†*‚ÄúHelped me stay cool under pressure at work without zoning out like other stuff I‚Äôve tried.‚Äù*
* **A forum user (verified buyer)**¬†mentioned improved memory and concentration during study sessions.

Most people mentioned similar benefits: better sleep, reduced anxiety, improved focus. I only saw a couple reviews mentioning mild grogginess when they took it during the day, so timing may matter.  
  


# Price and Where to Buy‚Äã

Whispeara isn‚Äôt cheap, but it‚Äôs also not outrageous for what you‚Äôre getting. Here‚Äôs the current pricing as of May 2025:  
  


* **1 bottle**: $59.99 (30-day supply)
* **3 bottles**: $149.97 ($49.99 each)
* **6 bottles**: $239.94 ($39.99 each)

I went with the 3-bottle pack after my first month because I knew I wanted to stick with it. They offer a 60-day money-back guarantee, too, which made me feel better about the initial purchase.  
  
Pro tip: ONLY buy from the official website. Too many fakes floating around online.  
  
  
**Availability Check: Is Whispeara Currently in Stock on the Official Website?**  
  


# Final Verdict: Is Whispeara Worth It?‚Äã

For me? Absolutely yes.  
  
Is it a miracle pill? No. You still need to do the inner work‚Äîsleep right, eat decently, unplug sometimes. But Whispeara gave me the¬†*space*¬†to do those things more easily. Like a quiet, steady support system in capsule form.  
  
If you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed, scattered, or just not quite yourself lately, Whispeara might be worth a shot. It‚Äôs natural, clean, and‚Äîat least for me‚Äîit worked better than anything else I‚Äôve tried.

# Weeks 3-4: Focus, Calm, and Just Feeling¬†Normal‚Äã

I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúmedicated‚Äù or artificially calm‚Äîit‚Äôs more like I felt like¬†*myself*, just on a really good day. Focus during work improved, and I found myself reacting less emotionally to little stressors. Even my partner noticed I wasn‚Äôt as tense or on edge.

# What Other Users Are Saying (Real Feedback)¬†‚Äã

While I don‚Äôt usually base my decisions¬†*solely*¬†on reviews, I went back to check in with others online and see if their experiences matched mine. Here‚Äôs a quick roundup:  
  


* **u/ MindfulMel**¬†on Reddit said:¬†*‚ÄúThis is the only supplement that didn‚Äôt give me weird side effects. I‚Äôve been taking it for 2 months and haven‚Äôt had a panic episode since.‚Äù*
* **TrustPilot Review**:¬†*‚ÄúHelped me stay cool under pressure at work without zoning out like other stuff I‚Äôve tried.‚Äù*
* **A forum user (verified buyer)**¬†mentioned improved memory and concentration during study sessions.

Most people mentioned similar benefits: better sleep, reduced anxiety, improved focus. I only saw a couple reviews mentioning mild grogginess when they took it during the day, so timing may matter.  
  


# Price and Where to Buy‚Äã

Whispeara isn‚Äôt cheap, but it‚Äôs also not outrageous for what you‚Äôre getting. Here‚Äôs the current pricing as of May 2025:  
  


* **1 bottle**: $59.99 (30-day supply)
* **3 bottles**: $149.97 ($49.99 each)
* **6 bottles**: $239.94 ($39.99 each)

I went with the 3-bottle pack after my first month because I knew I wanted to stick with it. They offer a 60-day money-back guarantee, too, which made me feel better about the initial purchase.  
  
Pro tip: ONLY buy from the official website. Too many fakes floating around online.  
  
  
**Availability Check: Is Whispeara Currently in Stock on the Official Website?**  
  


# Final Verdict: Is Whispeara Worth It?‚Äã

For me? Absolutely yes.  
  
Is it a miracle pill? No. You still need to do the inner work‚Äîsleep right, eat decently, unplug sometimes. But Whispeara gave me the¬†*space*¬†to do those things more easily. Like a quiet, steady support system in capsule form.  
  
If you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed, scattered, or just not quite yourself lately, Whispeara might be worth a shot. It‚Äôs natural, clean, and‚Äîat least for me‚Äîit worked better than anything else I‚Äôve tried.

# How I Found Whispeara‚Äã

Let‚Äôs rewind to late January. Like many freelancers juggling deadlines, endless notifications, and a general sense of chaos, I was burnt out. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust this constant background hum of anxiety and mental fog that coffee couldn‚Äôt clear. I tried apps, meditation, journaling‚Äîyou name it. Then I stumbled across Whispeara in a wellness forum.  
  
People were talking about it like it was this hidden gem. ‚ÄúClearer thoughts,‚Äù ‚Äúsleeping like a baby,‚Äù ‚Äúno more 3 AM anxiety spirals.‚Äù Naturally, I was skeptical. But the reviews felt... honest. So I figured, why not?  
  


# First Impressions‚Äã

I ordered directly from the official site‚Äîmainly because I didn‚Äôt want to mess around with third-party sellers‚Äîand it arrived in about 5 days. Sleek little bottle, calming pastel label, and a clean ingredient list (more on that in a sec). So far, so good.  
  


# What‚Äôs Inside Whispeara? (Ingredients Breakdown)‚Äã

Whispeara markets itself as an all-natural cognitive and emotional support supplement. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of the key ingredients:  
  


* **Ashwagandha**: No surprise here‚Äîthis adaptogen has been used for centuries to reduce stress and balance mood. For me, this is the star of the show.
* **L-Theanine**: Found in green tea, it‚Äôs known for its calming effects without drowsiness. Perfect for people like me who need calm¬†*and*¬†focus.
* **GABA**: A naturally occurring neurotransmitter that helps tone down brain overactivity. Definitely felt this one working.
* **Lemon Balm Extract**: Helps with relaxation and better sleep quality.
* **Magnesium Glycinate**: The most absorbable form of magnesium, known for its benefits on sleep and muscle tension.
* **Chamomile & Valerian Root**: Gentle herbs that support rest and reduce anxious tension.

All ingredients are non-GMO, vegan, and third-party tested. I appreciate that transparency‚Äîit‚Äôs not some shady ‚Äúproprietary blend‚Äù that hides what‚Äôs really in it.  
  


# What It Actually¬†Did¬†for Me‚Äã

# Week 1: Subtle but Real‚Äã

I didn‚Äôt feel an immediate wave of calm or anything magical on Day One. But by the end of the first week, I noticed I wasn‚Äôt getting as easily frazzled. My brain didn‚Äôt feel like it was running 38 tabs all at once.

I can't take off my hijab at school anymore because it's a big uni and there's too many people from the community that know me and think I'm a hijabi.

I also see how many of my female family members are able to make friends with all the other muslim girls, I have no friends. I make friends with non muslims and I am not allowed to hang out with them, so I only see them at school and often end up in friendships where it's just a result of having class with the person. Most people are not interested if the friendship can't go past that.

I also don't connect with muslim girls, I tried but she was constantly ranting about Islam and I just didn't want to hear it so I distanced myself.  Being friends with muslims often means they will give you islamic ""advice"" or want to try to make each other better muslims which I am not interested in.

I also don't make friends with muslims because in the future when i take off my hijab and marry a non muslim guy and do all these things, they'd find out at some point and we would just stop being friends. They are nice now but if they find out you went down this path they would switch up so I see no reason in trying to build a community of friendships that I know I'm going to lose.

I have to ask my parents permission for the dumbest things, just to go get coffee with a friend, I feel ugly in modest clothing and hijab. I don't waste too much money on clothing because I can't buy the stuff I want and I don't really like islamically modest outfits on me.

Whenever I do go out, it's never what I want to do because my parents are texting and calling and checking my location. I always end up going to the mall or going out to eat, and its never with someone i truly enjoy being around because I can only go out with the very few people my parents approve of. I cannot travel with friends, I cant go further than the city, I cant go to the gym alone or with friends, I cant do activities at their house.

Im still in college and no part time job will allow for me to move out in this economy. all the money will go to rent and i cant go out anyway cause theres no money to. I want to study abroad for a semester but what will happen when I come back? This is so tiring.

  
I also get jealous of my cousins because their parents allowed them to dorm in college, study abroad, travel, have friends, didn't force them to wear hijab. I wish my mom didn't choose my dad, she didnt even wear a hijab until she was in her 30s. If she married someone else this would be so much easier.",3,1750907127.0,exmuslim,5,1.0,False

I‚Äôm sure this applies to Ireland as well, but in general people are more social than ever and will go out 5 nights a week, but they don‚Äôt necessarily want to drink or eat an expensive meal 5 nights a week.

My child turns 3 this Saturday, and a myriad of life circumstances have left us without any plans in the world for her big day. A few weeks ago, we imagined a backyard party at our house, but then had some landscaping/outdoor issues that rendered our space a poor choice for that type of gathering. Then, I was laid off from my job of 6 years, and my brain semi-imploded for a while, leaving my executive functioning in shambles and unable to be cheerful enough to plan something fun. Now her birthday is in just a few days, and even though she's young enough that she's not going to necessarily remember a lackluster birthday, I'd still like to do some fun things with her, my husband, and her almost-5-year-old brother to celebrate the occasion. On weekends, we typically will do any combination of farmer's market, bike riding, coffee shop, outdoor play, maybe zoo/aquarium/nature center. We are in a midwest city with plenty of fun things to do.

I found out why.,"I‚Äôve been having recurring nightmares, ever since I was a kid. The same ones in a vicious loop. One was your typical stuck at sea with no landmarks in sight, paddling a small raft through a storm, right up until I fall into the ocean, if you‚Äôve ever been in the deep ocean, you know what that looks like, this starts as that. The moment you‚Äôre under there is nothing but blue, when I look around I can see the rays of light refracting through the water, small streaks of the Sun trying their hardest to press through the ocean‚Äôs oppressive blue. It‚Äôs when I look down that my heart drops. The light focuses into a small cone rimmed with blue, and underneath, it‚Äôs pitch black, however in my nightmare, I can always make out what looks like a face. Not a human‚Äôs, no, it‚Äôs as if the entire ocean has a face swirling under it that‚Äôs watching me with gleeful hatred, laughing silently, the force of its chuckles sending the waves frothing above me in a frenzy, and when I come back up? No raft, no land. Just me and what I can only call Poseidon‚Äôs ugly mug jeering at me as I cough and sputter. I‚Äôll never go out on open waters.

The second is much more abstract. I wake up at home, my childhood home to be specific, even as I get older, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs locked to that specific place. I get out of bed, I look through the house, and no-one is there. As a child this would lead to the well of tears bursting from my eyes as I ran frantically around looking for them. Nowadays when I get this one I just face the inevitable, I sit on the old couch in the living room and wait. It knocks at the same time every night, and when I open the door and step out onto the driveway, everything falls away, leaving me in darkness, and then the lights come on, one after another as I walk forward, an ephemeral blue path replacing the familiar concrete of the driveway, it winds up and away to the left, this part is never that bad, but as I walk further and further lights start to snap on off the path, and that‚Äôs where the horror lies, in the harsh white if those lights are all my loved ones and friends, eyes rolled back, tongues lolling out of their mouths. Just their heads, placed upon pikes, like I‚Äôm walking through a trophy hunter‚Äôs collection and all his hunts have been preparing to take me on, but there is no hunter, there‚Äôs not even any noise, just one after another until the end of the path, and there‚Äôs no turning back, when the lights go off the path disappears, one time I tried to run backward, and the moment I step off the blue, I fall. In a sickening sense of vertigo, I watch as the world flies upward, like clipping though a floor in a video game and watching as the map gets further and further out of reach, I usually wake up when all I can see is a pinprick of color.

Before I go to this last one though, I think you should know, there‚Äôs no getting off the ride once it‚Äôs started, I‚Äôve tried it all. Wiggling toes, screaming, telling myself it‚Äôs a dream, closing my eyes, blinking as fast as my eyes will allow. It‚Äôs useless, the rollercoaster doesn‚Äôt stop once you‚Äôre over the hill.

This last one though, has been evolving. It starts with a normality to it that lulls me into thinking its a normal dream, watching tv, or talking to a family member in the living room, but the doorbell changes it all, the family member disappears without a trace, the TV snaps to static, and forces you to check the door. There used to be nothing there. Not a person, not a thing, or even a monster. But as I stand and look out into the dark street, an indescribable fear bubbles in my gut, it freezes my limbs, and numbs the white hot anger that boils as I open the door, ready to scream at whatever is there. But there‚Äôs nothing. And then you hear the footsteps. They aren‚Äôt loud, or wet, just extremely fast. Whatever is making those noises has always given me a primal instinct to run and hide. To get the hell away from whatever was coming toward me, I used to hide in the hall closet, holding my breath and hoping it would just go away, but it never did. No, instead I would hear the glass screen door shatter as the footsteps got to it and quickly thundered through house like a blitzkrieg, and then the closet door would fly open, and I‚Äôd scream in terror as nothing came in close to me. 

I can‚Äôt see it, but I hear it, smell it, feel it. The deep rumblings of some unnatural growl, the smell of rot and death coming from the direction of the noise, and the feeling you get when you open the oven to check your dinner and get toasted by the rush of warm air. I used to wake up then, hell I used to not see it. I wish it was still like that. I had the dream over and over, over the span of my quarter century life I‚Äôve had this experience at least 1000 times. But the more it happened, the more I saw. At first just its yellow eyes, the eyes of a hungry gray wolf looking at its next meal. Then, it‚Äôs head, canine yes, but twisted, a child‚Äôs imitation of a wolf, horribly elongated snout, way too large. If you‚Äôre thinking twilight wolves, you‚Äôre thinking too small. This things jaws could cover the height of the door frame with it hung open, and it‚Äôs teeth, if you could even call them that. Its jawbones were deeply serrated, ending on either side in large fangs, its mouth a moonless night. When it pounced, the sheer fear would drive me bolt upright in bed, cold sweat soaking the sheets. 

Then, I‚Äôd see it outside. It stood like a scared cat at the end of the driveway, looming over the cars on legs the size of tree-trunks. Then it would hunch low and pounce at the door. I say all this because lately, I‚Äôve just been having this last one, no more ocean mocking me as I drown, no more heads of my loved ones on a floaty path, just this monstrous beast, breaking into my home and devouring me whole. After I‚Äôd wake up, I‚Äôd laugh to myself, there‚Äôs no way that could ever be. But trying to go back to sleep, the bravado would wear down to the what ifs, those what ifs intensified the following mornings. Things would be off, like my nightstand, normally all my stuff is just kinda piled there so I can grab it all the next day, but it was all on the floor. I was just chalking it up to me struggling in the real world as my mind was in Hell on repeat. This thing has been slowly consuming my dreamscape. 

Every dream I have, it‚Äôs been there. A nice dream walking through a museum? It‚Äôs in a painting, eyes glowing through the chunky strokes of paint. A quiet walk through the sunlit woods? Its legs are walking alongside me in the distance. It‚Äôs getting closer every-time. Even in the most mundane dreams of conversing with people, their mouths start to morph, growing sickeningly long and that odious, thunderous growl replaces their speech. Last night, I had it again, waking up in a start, my chest was pounding faster than it should be, my head feeling light and my body weak. Was this thing killing me with fear? I pondered this as I tossed and turned. As I did, I noticed my chest ached, when I pulled up my shirt, there was a massive bruise across it. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep much since. When I do fall asleep, it‚Äôs there, and when I wake up, the bruising is worse. I went to the doctor‚Äôs office, but they said there‚Äôs nothing internally wrong, that it‚Äôs apparently just bruising from pressure on my chest. 

When I got home. I started to notice more weird things. I don‚Äôt own any pets, but there‚Äôs claw marks on my door. And the window of my room was cracked open. I freaked out a little bit. I called up my grandmother, wise as she is, at least in old wives‚Äô tales and myths. ‚ÄúHey Omi! Do you have time to talk?‚Äù I asked as lighthearted as I could manage. I knew she did, but I always felt the compulsion to ask her, just in case she had gotten busy with housework, or was watching her soaps, she loves those damned things. ‚ÄúOf course sweetie! I just finished a nice apple pie if you wanna come by and visit!‚Äù She said cheerfully. I agreed immediately. I told her I‚Äôd be there in about 15 minutes and hung up the phone. I haven‚Äôt seen her in a couple months, and with everything going on I could really use some human interaction aside from the workplace chatter. When I arrived she was sitting in her rocking chair on the front porch of her farmhouse. My grandpa wasn‚Äôt the kindest man, but damn did he know how to take care of a home. the house still looked the same after 25 years, just a new-ish coat of paint. It used to be white, but with it aging, Opa just slapped some gray on there to cover the stains. She waved as I walked up the drive and stood from her rocker to meet me. ‚ÄúDaniel! How have you been? It feels like forever since I last set eyes on you!‚Äù She asked, her soft eyes looking me up and down proudly, but when she saw the dark rings lining the bottom of my eyes, her face sagged a bit, ‚ÄúHave you been having trouble sleeping dear?‚Äù 

‚ÄúJust a little Omi, that‚Äôs actually what I came to talk about, but how have y‚Äôall been? It‚Äôs been a few months since I was here, and I‚Äôm sorry about that. Work has just been exhausting lately.‚Äù I said trying to sound happy as I opened the front door and waited for her to walk inside. ‚ÄúOh you know us, just putt-putting around, your grandfather is off at the hardware store, I swear he loves that place more than me sometimes!‚Äù She laughed as she made her way to the kitchen, i shut the door behind us and followed her to the smell of apple pie. We talked and caught up with each other as we ate. Finally, after a few pieces of pie to bolster my courage, I told her what had been happening, and asked her if the dreams, and things around the house meant anything to her. 

She let her eyes drift down to her cup of coffee and thought for a moment, brow furrowed like there was something on the tip of her tongue. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure sweetheart, I‚Äôm not exactly a doctor on sleep or anything unfortunately. But, I do need to ask, you don‚Äôt have any marks on you, do you?‚Äù She frowned. I stood up and lifted my shirt to reveal the bruising on my chest, and her eyes went wide. She started praying in German to herself and left the room, telling me to stay there. When she came back she held a dusty old tome in her wrinkled hands. Slapping it down on the table sending dust flying off the cover, she skimmed through the pages and with a quick aha, she turned the book around for me to see, tapping a page with her finger. I slid the book closer to me and read through the page. It was an entry talking about Mares, not the horse, but apparently a malicious being that sits on you while you sleep causing nightmares, using the fear the nightmares generate to feed. 

As I read she spoke, ‚ÄúDaniel honey, you need to follow what that book tells you to do, and get whatever is in your home out, and if you can‚Äôt, then you come here and stay with us for a while and I‚Äôll send your Opa over there to take care of it!‚Äù She smiled as she finished, and I couldn‚Äôt tell if the joy was from helping me, or at the idea that she got to boss Opa around a little more. ‚ÄúAre you sure this is what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked as I looked through the page, paintings of small demons sitting upon people‚Äôs chest. I was silently praying that I just couldn‚Äôt remember some impact that had bruised my chest. ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm pretty sure, nightmares is one thing, but that bruise, and the scratches at your door, that sounds like a mare in my book‚Äù she nodded back toward the page. My chest ached as I imagined some tiny demon sitting in my chest in the night, watching me struggle in my dreams while it fed off me. I shifted uncomfortably in my chair. At the bottom of the page was a bunch of different methods for keeping the thing at bay. Leaving upside down slippers at your beside, boiling water in a new jar and plugging it with a new cork, or finding a hole that has yet to be patched in your home to keep it from getting in. At the bottom was a german prayer, translating it to English (thanks Google, I‚Äôm not gonna explain how that works, by the way.) it simply read-

Here I am lying down to sleep; No night-mare shall plague me until they have swum through all the waters that flow upon the earth, and counted all stars that appear in the firmament. Thus help me God Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen!

I thanked my grandmother profusely, the sun had gone down, and feeling like I had a way out, I gave her a big hug, told her to say hi to Opa for me, and headed home. On my way I stopped at the store, grabbing a pair of slippers, a jar, and a cork. Returning home I found more weird things, bits of blackened nails now stuck in the gouges at my bedroom door, no longer just scratches, and reeking throughout the house was this pervading smell of sulphur and dead flowers. I went to work, i boiled a pot of water and poured it into the glass jar, corking it with the corks I had bought, and placed it on my nightstand. I placed the slippers upside down at the foot of my bed, and getting into, read that prayer from my notes app, and went to sleep. Nothing. Just inky blackness for what seemed like two seconds, but when I awoke, it was dark in my room, the clock read 3 AM. I sat up, thanking the lord for my salvation, thats when I saw it. Standing the same way it stood in my dreams, the size of a great dane, was the thing from my dreams. I shivered as I watched it circling my bed, gouging the floor with every step and growling, staring through me with those fiery ember eyes. I asked it what it wants from me, and surprisingly, in a deep and feminine tone, all it said was, ‚Äúyou..‚Äù sitting down and opening its mouth, that yawning cavern. 

As it did something started to shift in it, its legs and arms crunching and drawing up into its animal head, the only thing I could think was that I‚Äôm going to die here. A mass started to rise from its throat, seemingly materializing from the pool of darkness inside. Long back hair swung from the wolf‚Äôs mouth, a head following it. A shockingly beautiful head of a young woman, her eyes shining with the moonlight coming through the window. The irises a golden yellow. She smiled coyly as her shoulders started to emerge from the beast. As more of her body emerged, the more of the animal sagged into a lifeless skin with a squelch, the bones cracking and groaning, and by the time the transformation was done, a petite woman stood over the foot of my bed wrapped in the wolf‚Äôs skin like a tunic, the mouth of which was clamped shut over her shoulder, a disgusting adornment. I was fozen in fear and confusion. What the actual fuck is going on. That tome said that women could become these things, but I assumed that was akin to medieval people saying women were witches, sitting here now, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. I started to reach for the jar, but she flicked her eyes from mine to the jar, and then back to me, her smile growing more mischievous, she spoke something in German, and I lost control of my limbs, the weight of my head becoming unbearable as I fell to the mattress in a slump, my vision starting to waver. 

The last thing I remember before passing out was her hand grabbing my ankle. I woke up in darkness akin to the night that surrounded that blue pathway of pikes. The sounds of water slowly dripping echoing off in the distance, reminds me of the laughing maw of the ocean depths. My legs still won‚Äôt move, and I feel extremely groggy. I tried counting the seconds to no avail, i lost count after about 10 minutes. Feeling in my pockets I found my phone. I‚Äôm typing this now because I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll make it out of here. I‚Äôd call 911, but I couldn‚Äôt even tell them where I am, I‚Äôve been crawling around, trying to get my bearings, but there‚Äôs no sign of a passageway, just the slick walls of stone that surround me. If this makes it out into the world, please help me, I can hear growling off in the darkness, and if that nightmare held any truth, I don‚Äôt think I can hide from this thing much longer.",1,1750906576.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

[Part 1]","Have you ever been to a college town in the summer? It feels like the rapture happened overnight. One minute the streets are filled with graduates eager to start their vacation, the next they‚Äôre lifeless and empty. As a newcomer in this area, the silence is incredibly lonesome.

Don't get me wrong, the town itself is fine. It's one of those classic university communities where half the population turns over every semester and the other half has been here since the 1960s. Coffee shops on every corner, bookstores that smell like old paper and water damage, and so many bars that it makes you question how they can all stay in business at the same time. The kind of place that looks perfect in college brochures.

I can‚Äôt complain, especially since my mom agreed to cover my stay here if I promised to keep my GPA up. In fact, she was ecstatic when I proposed moving halfway across the country. Which, to be honest, was a bit of a surprise. Growing up, she‚Äôd always been more on the overprotective side. Constantly keeping track of my location and always checking the locks twice before we went to bed. To her credit, we‚Äôd had a pretty bad break-in when I was four years old. It messed her up for quite a while, but I was too young to remember much of what happened. Whenever I try to think about that night, it‚Äôs just distant, fuzzy images of the police dragging someone out of my bedroom and throwing them into a cop car.

The problem isn‚Äôt the town, the problem is me. Or more specifically, how hard it is for me to make friends.

Back home, I had a close knit group. Most of us had known each other since elementary school and spent every free second we had together. Nearly a decade of inside jokes, backyard concerts and video game tournaments had come to an end this summer. Now everyone's scattered across different states, different time zones. We try to stay in touch through group chats and video calls, but it's not the same. Jake's busy with his engineering program, Marcus is working two jobs to pay for school, and Sarah's three hours ahead on the East Coast. By the time I'm free to hang out, they're already asleep, studying or living their new lives without me.

Most days, the only person I actually talk to face-to-face is Bill, my mailman.

Bill's in his fifties and sports a pair of massive blue sunglasses that take up half of his face. He wears them every single day regardless of weather. His skin looks as though he was a surfer, leathery and thick after years of direct sun. Either that or he needed to cutback on the spray tans. He's friendly enough though, always asks how I'm settling in, if I need anything, the kind of small talk that makes you feel less invisible.

""Another package for you today."" Bill handed me the box, his massive sunglasses reflecting my disheveled appearance. ""You sure do order a lot of stuff online.""

""Easier than figuring out where all the stores are,"" I told him, which was partially true. The real truth was that ordering things online meant I had something to look forward to, even if it was just a new webcam I'd impulse-bought at 2 AM.

""I get it. If you ever need someone to show you around, just let me know."" His smile was genuine, and for a moment my loneliness subsided. If only for a moment. When your mailman is the closest thing you have to a regular social interaction, you know you're in trouble.

That's probably why I started streaming.

It seemed like the perfect solution for an introvert like myself. I could connect with people without having to navigate the awkward social dynamics of college parties or trying to insert myself into established friend groups.

My setup was pretty basic. A decent webcam, a microphone that didn't sound too terrible, and my gaming PC positioned so my bed wasn't visible in the background. I had to keep an air of professionalism somehow. I even bought a few LED strips to finish off my ‚ÄòCliche Streamer Starter Kit.‚Äô

For the first two weeks, my viewer count stayed at a solid zero. Occasionally someone would pop in, maybe say ""hi"" in chat, then disappear after a minute or two. I tried different games, different times of day, nothing seemed to work. I couldn‚Äôt help but think that at a certain point, I had gone from streaming to genuinely just talking to myself.

But I kept at it.

It was during this time that I started noticing small things around my apartment that seemed... wrong. Nothing dramatic, just tiny details that made me question my own memory. I'd leave a coffee mug on my desk and find it in the kitchen sink later‚Äîclean but still slightly warm, like it had been recently washed. Books on my shelf would be arranged differently. Nothing wildly out of order, just shifted enough that the spines didn't line up the way I remembered leaving them.

At first I chalked it up to stress. Moving to a new place, being isolated, spending too much time alone. My brain was playing tricks on me. Everyone misplaces things.

Then last week, something changed with my streams. I went live around 9 PM like usual, ready for another night of incessantly talking to myself while playing some indie horror game I'd picked up on sale. After about 20 minutes of radio silence, my viewer count showed 1 instead of 0.

Someone was actually watching.

I tried to play it cool, didn't want to scare them off by being too eager. ""Hey there, welcome to the stream,"" I said, trying to sound natural. ""Thanks for hanging out with me tonight.""

The viewer didn't say anything in chat. No introduction, no emoticons, nothing. But they stayed. For the entire two-hour stream, that little ""1"" never moved. Someone was genuinely watching me play, listening to me ramble about game mechanics and random thoughts that popped into my head.

It should have felt good. Finally, after weeks of streaming to an empty room, I had a viewer. But something about it made me uncomfortable. Maybe it was the complete silence on their end. I know it‚Äôs normal for someone to watch a stream passively, but I can‚Äôt shake the uncanny feeling that I was being‚Ä¶ observed.

Right before I was about to end the stream and log off for the night, a message finally appeared in chat.

**wx11flow3r\_75:**¬†‚ÄúI love watching you...‚Äù

Before I could respond, they left. The viewer count dropped back to 0, and I was left alone in my apartment again.

That night, I heard something in the walls behind my head.

I was lying in bed, scrolling through my phone and trying to wind down, when I heard a faint scratching sound. I wanted to believe it was just the building settling, but something about the noise felt purposeful. Like fingernails dragging slowly across wood.

The sound seemed to move around me toward the wall where my computer setup was. I followed it, crouching down under my desk to get closer to the baseboard. Whatever it was, it stopped moving. That's when I noticed a small hole in the wall. Fresh wood shavings littered the baseboard below it‚Äîthis wasn't here yesterday. It was barely visible, maybe half an inch wide with cracks spider-webbing outward behind my computer.

As I leaned closer to examine it, I felt a strange temperature change wash over me. A warm blast of air brushed against my skin before returning to normal. I leaned even closer. The scratching stopped.

Peering into the small hole, I saw the glossy shine of an eye staring back at me. It was pure black and unmoving. My muscles tensed as my body entered a state of fight-or-flight. I hurled myself backward out of instinct and let out a stifled scream. As I landed on the ground, I heard the scratching begin again, even more frantic. But this time, the scratching was accompanied by another sound: Squeaking.

*Jesus Christ, it was just a rat?*¬†I thought, as I sighed a long breath of equal relief and frustration. Of course it was a rat. This is an old building and the summer heat drives them inside. I'd dealt with mice in my bedroom growing up. This was essentially the same thing, just bigger.

I spent the rest of the night convincing myself there was nothing supernatural happening in my apartment, tossing and turning feverishly as the scratches intermittently returned.

Days passed without much excitement. I streamed every night and without fail, ‚Äò**wx11flow3r\_75**‚Äô was there. At least, I had to assume it was them. Even though a message rarely ever popped up in chat, my viewer count never wavered from 1. At times it felt voyeuristic, but in a way, I guess that‚Äôs the appeal of live streams. I grew to enjoy the company of that number ‚Äú1‚Äù some nights, knowing that at least someone was there with me.

Two days ago I ended my stream a little early to the disappointment of my ‚Äòfaithful viewer‚Äô.

‚ÄúAlright guys, I‚Äôm gonna end it here for the night. I have to clean up my place a little bit before bed, it‚Äôs a fucking mess.‚Äù I said, taking off my headphones and closing out of the game as I looked around the disheveled work station.

Just as I clicked ‚ÄòEnd Stream‚Äô, a message in the chat appeared.

**wx11flow3r\_75:**¬†‚Äòno, please! I barely get to see you anymore.‚Äô

I didn‚Äôt have time to respond before the live stream cut out. I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve even known how to respond. What could they have meant by barely got to see me anymore? I shook it off and stuck to my plan of tidying up the apartment. I loaded up empty cans of energy drinks and Styrofoam boxes of leftover fast food into a trash bag and made my way to the dumpsters.

As I walked around to the back of the building, I spotted movement in one of the second floor windows. I probably should have minded my own business, kept walking, thrown away my garbage and gone back inside. But something compelled me to stop and look.

It was a girl‚Äîroughly my age‚Äîwith dark red hair pulled back in a loose ponytail. She was in what looked like her bedroom, pulling off a paint splattered t-shirt and replacing it with a rather tight fitting sweater. The back light of her bedroom hugged the curves of her skin, making it seem like her form was glowing. For just a moment I stood there, gazing at her through the window. She moved around her room with effortless grace, completely unaware that anyone was observing her. She turned around and I caught a glimpse of her face as she scanned her bedroom. She was breath-taking. When I caught sight of her emerald green eyes, I realized those eyes were just as capable of seeing me back.

That‚Äôs when I caught myself.¬†*What the hell am I doing?*¬†I forced myself to look away and hurried toward the dumpster, my face burning with embarrassment.

But I couldn't stop thinking about her. The image of her beautiful auburn hair flowing against her back as she walked. I had barely even seen her face, but she was undoubtedly gorgeous.

That next morning when Bill showed up with my mail, I couldn‚Äôt help myself but ask him about the mysterious, alluring neighbor.

After a few pleasantries I took my chance, ""Hey, do you know the girl who lives on the second floor? Facing the back alley? Red hair, maybe an art student?""

The reflection in his glasses showed two of me staring back, eagerly waiting for a response. ""Oh, you mean Anna,"" he said after a moment. ""She's in 2B. Sweet girl, keeps to herself mostly. It‚Äôs her second year in this building. You thinking about introducing yourself?""

Anna. A palindrome. Even her name is poetic.

""Maybe,"" I said, trying to sound casual. ""Just wanted to get to know the neighbors, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, pal.‚Äù Bill smiled and gave me an awkward thumbs up before continuing down the block.

That evening, I found myself staring at my phone, debating whether or not to search for her. Just the name Anna wasn‚Äôt much to go off of, but with how small this town is, I could almost definitely find her on Instagram or Facebook.

I caved.

It started innocently enough. I was just curious to see if she had any public profiles online. I started by looking up ‚ÄúAnna‚Äù plus the name of our town. Then ‚ÄúAnna‚Äù plus the name of our college. It didn‚Äôt yield much, which wasn‚Äôt surprising. It was a Hail Mary in the first place with so little information. I was ready to put my phone away when I remembered the paint smeared on her shirt. It struck me,

*Maybe she‚Äôs an artist*...

It took a total of about twenty minutes but sure enough, there she was. Her business page on Instagram appeared. She apparently uses it to sell some of her art pieces around town. I thought that was about as far as I‚Äôd get before I noticed she tagged herself in one of the photos of a client holding her painting. I recognized the burnt orange hair in her profile picture immediately. I felt like a real Dick Tracy. Her Bio said she was a junior at the university, studying fine arts with a focus on 40‚Äôs Abstract Expressionism.

I scrolled through her profile. Pictures of her artwork featuring streaks of bold colors and unique textures. Photos of her out with friends at coffee shops and campus events. Her style was definitely more subdued, but I kind of liked that. She mostly opted for a pair of jeans and a graphic t-shirt. She also seemed to be fond of a particular dark green military jacket, most likely thrifted. It appeared in almost every other post. She seemed to save the dresses and jewelry for special occasions. I kept scrolling to find a few more selfies and even one with her wearing a Lou Reed shirt. The nineteen year-old version of me is currently a bit more rational, but a couple years ago I would have fallen head over heels for this girl in a heartbeat.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve changed as much as I like to think I have.

My eyes kept darting over my shoulder, as if someone was going to catch me in some perverted act. But I wasn‚Äôt necessarily doing anything wrong. At least I don‚Äôt think so. Her profile is public, so obviously she‚Äôs okay with people looking her up. Everyone searches their crushes on social media, right? It's practically expected these days.

As I pressed my thumb against the screen to swipe back, I must have held it just a second too long because I accidentally pressed a button on the top of her page. I followed her. My heart sank to my stomach as I quickly pressed the ‚ÄòUnfollow‚Äô prompt only a second after it had changed.

*Fuck‚Ä¶ you dumb ass.*¬†I thought to myself, taking a deep breath.¬†*It‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no way she saw it that quickly.*¬†I slammed my phone down on the side table and hoped a good night‚Äôs sleep would rid this embarrassment from my body.

That was when the scratching began again.

I woke up this morning in desperate need of caffeine, I opened my fridge to find an empty space where my energy drinks should‚Äôve been. I could‚Äôve swore I had at least two left, but between my lack of sleep and late night gaming binges, I didn‚Äôt put it past myself to have mindlessly finished them off. This meant a trip down to Mando‚Äôs, the small bodega just around the corner. Walking out, I reached for my keys on the hook behind the door and grasped at nothing but air.¬†*Damn it*, I thought. I left them in the kitchen the night before. But I told myself it was only a block away, and I'd be back in less than five minutes‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt need them.

Mando‚Äôs was one of those cramped little stores that still somehow manages to stock everything a drunk college student might need at 2AM. The clerk, a guy who looked to be in his forties with tired eyes, barely looked up from his phone when I walked in. His long brown hair hung like curtains, hiding most of his face. Multiple piercings and tattoos were scattered across his body without much cohesion.

""Just this,"" I said, placing two drinks on the counter.

He scanned them without enthusiasm. ""Six fifty.""

I handed him exact change and was heading for the door when he called after me.

""You live in the building on Maple Street, right? The brick one?""

I turned back, surprised. ""Yeah, how'd you know?""

""See you walking by sometimes. You're new, right?""

It was a bit unsettling to know someone was keeping tabs on me without my knowledge. I replied, ""Few months now.""

He nodded. ‚ÄúYou seen anything ‚Ä¶ strange since you‚Äôve moved in?‚Äù

I thought about the scratching in my walls. Part of me wanted to tell him, but the other, louder part, didn‚Äôt want to look like a raving lunatic. ‚ÄúNot really‚Ä¶‚Äù I responded. I knew it was probably just rats anyway.

His eyebrow raised. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was out of curiosity or judgment. ‚ÄúNothing? Damn.‚Äù His face shifted to disappointment. I‚Äôm assuming he saw the confusion on my face because he continued unprompted, ‚ÄúThat building used to be an old mental institution before they built the college here. The¬†*last*¬†guy who lived in your unit said he could still hear the screams of patients when he was trying to sleep.‚Äù He let out a light chuckle as he finished the sentence. An unsettling smile grew across his face. ‚ÄúSaid he could feel the eyes of the orderlies and doctors glaring at him from the dark corners of the room you don‚Äôt pay attention to. The sounds of patients desperately trying to claw their way out through the walls.‚Äù

I froze, t*he scratching‚Ä¶*¬†‚ÄúThe last guy?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYeah, haven‚Äôt seen him for a couple of months so I assume he must‚Äôve finally left. Dude seemed a little wacko, but hell if he didn‚Äôt come in here with some good stories.‚Äù The tone in his voice implied that I should come back with a better tale next time.

I hesitated to tell him about my experiences, how I had also heard the scratching sounds late at night. I quickly decided that it wasn‚Äôt worth the fifteen minute conversation it would turn into. At least not right now. ‚ÄúSorry. It‚Äôs been pretty quiet since I‚Äôve moved in.‚Äù

He shrugged and retreated back into his phone. I thanked him and headed outside, but his words stuck with me. The previous tenant had felt watched too...

As I approached my building, I spotted the silhouette of someone sitting on the steps leading up to the second floor apartments. I stepped closer and the figure became more clear. It was the girl from the window‚ÄîAnna. She was wearing that same green jacket I'd seen in her photos.

When she noticed me approaching, I felt this wave of embarrassment wash over me. I wanted to hurry past her without making eye contact, praying she hadn't somehow seen me looking at her the other night.

I was almost to my door when her voice stopped me.

""Are you the one who was peeping through my window the other night?""

I froze, the energy drinks suddenly feeling like they weighed a hundred pounds.

She was looking directly at me now, her expression more curious than angry. ""I live in 2B, second floor... Tuesday night, around eleven. You were by the dumpster and I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw you watching me.""

My face was burning. I wanted to deny it, to play dumb, to somehow make this conversation end. But she'd clearly seen me, and lying would only make it worse.

""I..."" I started, then stopped. How do you explain something like that without sounding like a complete creep? The honest answer felt impossible to say out loud.

""Well,"" I finally continued, ""your window was open.""

She stared at me for a moment, and I was sure she was about to tell me to stay away from her or threaten to call the cops. Instead, she started laughing.

""That's it? That's your excuse?""

""I mean, I stopped myself!"" I said quickly. ""I realized how weird it was and walked away. But yeah, for like ten seconds, I looked, and...‚Äù I trailed off, not sure how to finish that sentence without making it worse.

She laughed. ""At least you're honest,"" I was surprised to see she was still smiling. ""Most guys would have denied it completely or made up some dumb bull shit like ‚Äòoh I was admiring your posters‚Äô.

""There were posters?""

She shook her head and stood up, extending her hand toward me. ""I'm Anna, by the way.""

""Trevor. 1A."" I shook her hand, still not quite believing this conversation was happening. ""I'm really sorry about the... you know. Window thing. I swear I‚Äôm not normally like that. I haven‚Äôt made many friends since moving out here, and I think it‚Äôs messing with my head a little bit.""

""It's fine. Well, it's not really fine, but I appreciate the honesty. Just don‚Äôt do it again."" She smiled but her voice was stern. ‚ÄúAnd during the summer, this place really is a ghost town. I don‚Äôt blame you. I think we might be the only two people left in this building until August.‚Äù

We talked for a few more minutes and while most of it feels like a blur now, it must have went well because, before you know it, she had handed me her phone.

""Put your number in. I'm going out with some friends tomorrow night - nothing fancy, just this arcade downtown. You should come.""

I entered my contact information, still slightly stunned that being caught peeping had somehow led to getting an invitation out.

""I'll text you the details,"" she said, pocketing her phone. She flashed me a smile that could melt Mount Everest and headed back up the stairs. ""See you tomorrow, Trevor from 1A.""

I watched her disappear around the corner of the building before realizing that I was still holding my energy drinks. I headed toward my unit, feeling lighter than I had in weeks. An actual conversation with another human being. Plans for tomorrow night. The possibility of friends‚Ä¶ maybe even more.

Placing one of the drinks under my right arm, I reached to open the front door.

It was locked.

I stood still for a moment, confused.

I tried the handle again, then checked the apartment number to make sure I was at the right door. 1A, just like always.

""What the hell?"" I muttered, checking my pockets before remembering that my keys were sitting on the counter inside. I couldn't have locked the door.

I froze. Paranoia told me there was someone, or something, in my apartment. I stepped to the right and leaned in toward the window that looks into my kitchen. My mind was racing with possibilities. They ranged from the ‚Äòlikely‚Äô to the ‚Äòabsolutely insane‚Äô and everywhere in between.¬†*Did I close the door too hard and the bolt shut on it‚Äôs own? Did a homeless person get lucky checking door handles and is now holding himself up in my bedroom? Did one of the mental patients try to escape and the orderly locked the door before he reached it‚Ä¶?*¬†As I peered through the window, I saw nothing out of the ordinary. There were my keys splayed across the counter. With no other option, I had to call my landlord.

Carl, the maintenance man, showed up twenty minutes later with his master key. He looked mildly annoyed at being called out so early, but tried to hide it for me.

""Just glad it's something simple,"" he said as he unlocked my door. ""Could have been a lot worse.""

""Does this happen with a lot of units?"" I asked, genuinely confused about how a door could lock itself.

""Not recently,"" he paused. ""Actually, the guy who lived here before you was a real piece of work. Always complaining about weird stuff. Said he heard voices in the walls, kept talking about ghosts and people watching him. Kept calling about his door being locked when he swore he hadn't locked it. Not just the front door though. Bedroom, Bathroom, you name it.""

The mention of the previous tenant caught my attention. ""What happened to him?""

""Oh, he was a nightmare. Wouldn't pay rent on time, did all these modifications to the apartment without approval. Kept drilling holes in the walls, and claimed it helped stop the voices. I think he even had a special name for his paranormal friends‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWallflowers‚Äù, that's it. Guy basically squatted here for almost a year before we could get him evicted.""

Carl pushed open my door and stepped inside before grabbing my keys off of the hook and throwing them to me. ""One day I showed up with the landlord to serve him papers and he was just... gone. Left most of his stuff, never came back for his deposit. Probably moved on to terrorize some other building.""

""Did you ever find anything in the apartment‚Ä¶ in the walls?""

Carl shrugged. ""Nothing. Far as I could tell, he was just paranoid. Maybe doing too many drugs, you know? Started seeing things that weren't there. But he swore up and down that someone was watching him.‚Äù

We exchanged our goodbyes as he headed out and I thanked him again for the help. It wasn‚Äôt until the door was closed and he was gone that the realization struck me. A cold bead of sweat dripped down my spine as I looked down at the keys in my hand. I had just seen my keys on the kitchen counter less than 20 minutes ago. Why were they hanging on the hook when Carl grabbed them?

I spent the next several hours searching every corner of the house. The idea that someone made their way inside while I was gone wouldn‚Äôt leave me. Even after checking every room, I felt the need to check them again. I kept imagining I was playing a sick game of musical chairs‚Äîthe squatter following behind me as I checked each room and hiding out in the one I had only just cleared. I did one more sweep of the rooms, this time in a different order. They wouldn‚Äôt outsmart me if that was the case.

I went Live about an hour later than usual tonight, finally convincing myself that I was home alone. Every room and closet was empty and every possible hiding spot was clear. But as soon as my stream started, something felt different.

I just went live and my viewer count is already at 1, like someone had been sitting there refreshing my page, waiting for me to start.

A notification was waiting for me in the chat.

1lkp5qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lkp5qe/i_have_one_new_follower_part_1/,I have one new follower. [Part 1],"Have you ever been to a college town in the summer? It feels like the rapture happened overnight. One minute the streets are filled with graduates eager to start their vacation, the next they‚Äôre lifeless and empty. As a newcomer in this area, the silence is incredibly lonesome.

Don't get me wrong, the town itself is fine. It's one of those classic university communities where half the population turns over every semester and the other half has been here since the 1960s. Coffee shops on every corner, bookstores that smell like old paper and water damage, and so many bars that it makes you question how they can all stay in business at the same time. The kind of place that looks perfect in college brochures.

I can‚Äôt complain, especially since my mom agreed to cover my stay here if I promised to keep my GPA up. In fact, she was ecstatic when I proposed moving halfway across the country. Which, to be honest, was a bit of a surprise. Growing up, she‚Äôd always been more on the overprotective side. Constantly keeping track of my location and always checking the locks twice before we went to bed. To her credit, we‚Äôd had a pretty bad break-in when I was four years old. It messed her up for quite a while, but I was too young to remember much of what happened. Whenever I try to think about that night, it‚Äôs just distant, fuzzy images of the police dragging someone out of my bedroom and throwing them into a cop car.

The problem isn‚Äôt the town, the problem is me. Or more specifically, how hard it is for me to make friends.

Back home, I had a close knit group. Most of us had known each other since elementary school and spent every free second we had together. Nearly a decade of inside jokes, backyard concerts and video game tournaments had come to an end this summer. Now everyone's scattered across different states, different time zones. We try to stay in touch through group chats and video calls, but it's not the same. Jake's busy with his engineering program, Marcus is working two jobs to pay for school, and Sarah's three hours ahead on the East Coast. By the time I'm free to hang out, they're already asleep, studying or living their new lives without me.

Most days, the only person I actually talk to face-to-face is Bill, my mailman.

Bill's in his fifties and sports a pair of massive blue sunglasses that take up half of his face. He wears them every single day regardless of weather. His skin looks as though he was a surfer, leathery and thick after years of direct sun. Either that or he needed to cutback on the spray tans. He's friendly enough though, always asks how I'm settling in, if I need anything, the kind of small talk that makes you feel less invisible.

""Another package for you today."" Bill handed me the box, his massive sunglasses reflecting my disheveled appearance. ""You sure do order a lot of stuff online.""

""Easier than figuring out where all the stores are,"" I told him, which was partially true. The real truth was that ordering things online meant I had something to look forward to, even if it was just a new webcam I'd impulse-bought at 2 AM.

""I get it. If you ever need someone to show you around, just let me know."" His smile was genuine, and for a moment my loneliness subsided. If only for a moment. When your mailman is the closest thing you have to a regular social interaction, you know you're in trouble.

That's probably why I started streaming.

It seemed like the perfect solution for an introvert like myself. I could connect with people without having to navigate the awkward social dynamics of college parties or trying to insert myself into established friend groups.

My setup was pretty basic. A decent webcam, a microphone that didn't sound too terrible, and my gaming PC positioned so my bed wasn't visible in the background. I had to keep an air of professionalism somehow. I even bought a few LED strips to finish off my ‚ÄòCliche Streamer Starter Kit.‚Äô

For the first two weeks, my viewer count stayed at a solid zero. Occasionally someone would pop in, maybe say ""hi"" in chat, then disappear after a minute or two. I tried different games, different times of day, nothing seemed to work. I couldn‚Äôt help but think that at a certain point, I had gone from streaming to genuinely just talking to myself.

But I kept at it.

It was during this time that I started noticing small things around my apartment that seemed... wrong. Nothing dramatic, just tiny details that made me question my own memory. I'd leave a coffee mug on my desk and find it in the kitchen sink later‚Äîclean but still slightly warm, like it had been recently washed. Books on my shelf would be arranged differently. Nothing wildly out of order, just shifted enough that the spines didn't line up the way I remembered leaving them.

At first I chalked it up to stress. Moving to a new place, being isolated, spending too much time alone. My brain was playing tricks on me. Everyone misplaces things.

Then last week, something changed with my streams. I went live around 9 PM like usual, ready for another night of incessantly talking to myself while playing some indie horror game I'd picked up on sale. After about 20 minutes of radio silence, my viewer count showed 1 instead of 0.

Someone was actually watching.

I tried to play it cool, didn't want to scare them off by being too eager. ""Hey there, welcome to the stream,"" I said, trying to sound natural. ""Thanks for hanging out with me tonight.""

The viewer didn't say anything in chat. No introduction, no emoticons, nothing. But they stayed. For the entire two-hour stream, that little ""1"" never moved. Someone was genuinely watching me play, listening to me ramble about game mechanics and random thoughts that popped into my head.

It should have felt good. Finally, after weeks of streaming to an empty room, I had a viewer. But something about it made me uncomfortable. Maybe it was the complete silence on their end. I know it‚Äôs normal for someone to watch a stream passively, but I can‚Äôt shake the uncanny feeling that I was being‚Ä¶ observed.

Right before I was about to end the stream and log off for the night, a message finally appeared in chat.

**wx11flow3r\_75:** ‚ÄúI love watching you...‚Äù

Before I could respond, they left. The viewer count dropped back to 0, and I was left alone in my apartment again.

That night, I heard something in the walls behind my head.

I was lying in bed, scrolling through my phone and trying to wind down, when I heard a faint scratching sound. I wanted to believe it was just the building settling, but something about the noise felt purposeful. Like fingernails dragging slowly across wood.

The sound seemed to move around me toward the wall where my computer setup was. I followed it, crouching down under my desk to get closer to the baseboard. Whatever it was, it stopped moving. That's when I noticed a small hole in the wall. Fresh wood shavings littered the baseboard below it‚Äîthis wasn't here yesterday. It was barely visible, maybe half an inch wide with cracks spider-webbing outward behind my computer.

As I leaned closer to examine it, I felt a strange temperature change wash over me. A warm blast of air brushed against my skin before returning to normal. I leaned even closer. The scratching stopped.

Peering into the small hole, I saw the glossy shine of an eye staring back at me. It was pure black and unmoving. My muscles tensed as my body entered a state of fight-or-flight. I hurled myself backward out of instinct and let out a stifled scream. As I landed on the ground, I heard the scratching begin again, even more frantic. But this time, the scratching was accompanied by another sound: Squeaking.  
  
*Jesus Christ, it was just a rat?* I thought, as I sighed a long breath of equal relief and frustration. Of course it was a rat. This is an old building and the summer heat drives them inside. I'd dealt with mice in my bedroom growing up. This was essentially the same thing, just bigger.

I spent the rest of the night convincing myself there was nothing supernatural happening in my apartment, tossing and turning feverishly as the scratches intermittently returned.

Days passed without much excitement. I streamed every night and without fail, ‚Äò**wx11flow3r\_75**‚Äô was there. At least, I had to assume it was them. Even though a message rarely ever popped up in chat, my viewer count never wavered from 1. At times it felt voyeuristic, but in a way, I guess that‚Äôs the appeal of live streams. I grew to enjoy the company of that number ‚Äú1‚Äù some nights, knowing that at least someone was there with me.

Two days ago I ended my stream a little early to the disappointment of my ‚Äòfaithful viewer‚Äô.  
  
‚ÄúAlright guys, I‚Äôm gonna end it here for the night. I have to clean up my place a little bit before bed, it‚Äôs a fucking mess.‚Äù I said, taking off my headphones and closing out of the game as I looked around the disheveled work station.  
  
Just as I clicked ‚ÄòEnd Stream‚Äô, a message in the chat appeared.  
  
**wx11flow3r\_75:** ‚Äòno, please! I barely get to see you anymore.‚Äô

I didn‚Äôt have time to respond before the live stream cut out. I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve even known how to respond. What could they have meant by barely got to see me anymore? I shook it off and stuck to my plan of tidying up the apartment. I loaded up empty cans of energy drinks and Styrofoam boxes of leftover fast food into a trash bag and made my way to the dumpsters.

As I walked around to the back of the building, I spotted movement in one of the second floor windows. I probably should have minded my own business, kept walking, thrown away my garbage and gone back inside. But something compelled me to stop and look.

It was a girl‚Äîroughly my age‚Äîwith dark red hair pulled back in a loose ponytail. She was in what looked like her bedroom, pulling off a paint splattered t-shirt and replacing it with a rather tight fitting sweater. The back light of her bedroom hugged the curves of her skin, making it seem like her form was glowing. For just a moment I stood there, gazing at her through the window. She moved around her room with effortless grace, completely unaware that anyone was observing her. She turned around and I caught a glimpse of her face as she scanned her bedroom. She was breath-taking. When I caught sight of her emerald green eyes, I realized those eyes were just as capable of seeing me back.

That‚Äôs when I caught myself. *What the hell am I doing?* I forced myself to look away and hurried toward the dumpster, my face burning with embarrassment.

But I couldn't stop thinking about her. The image of her beautiful auburn hair flowing against her back as she walked. I had barely even seen her face, but she was undoubtedly gorgeous.

That next morning when Bill showed up with my mail, I couldn‚Äôt help myself but ask him about the mysterious, alluring neighbor.

After a few pleasantries I took my chance, ""Hey, do you know the girl who lives on the second floor? Facing the back alley? Red hair, maybe an art student?""

The reflection in his glasses showed two of me staring back, eagerly waiting for a response. ""Oh, you mean Anna,"" he said after a moment. ""She's in 2B. Sweet girl, keeps to herself mostly. It‚Äôs her second year in this building. You thinking about introducing yourself?""

Anna. A palindrome. Even her name is poetic.

""Maybe,"" I said, trying to sound casual. ""Just wanted to get to know the neighbors, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, pal.‚Äù Bill smiled and gave me an awkward thumbs up before continuing down the block.

That evening, I found myself staring at my phone, debating whether or not to search for her. Just the name Anna wasn‚Äôt much to go off of, but with how small this town is, I could almost definitely find her on Instagram or Facebook.

I caved.

It started innocently enough. I was just curious to see if she had any public profiles online. I started by looking up ‚ÄúAnna‚Äù plus the name of our town. Then ‚ÄúAnna‚Äù plus the name of our college. It didn‚Äôt yield much, which wasn‚Äôt surprising. It was a Hail Mary in the first place with so little information. I was ready to put my phone away when I remembered the paint smeared on her shirt. It struck me,

*Maybe she‚Äôs an artist*...

It took a total of about twenty minutes but sure enough, there she was. Her business page on Instagram appeared. She apparently uses it sell some of her art pieces around town. I thought that was about as far as I‚Äôd get before I noticed she tagged herself in one of the photos of a client holding her painting. I recognized the burnt orange hair in her profile picture immediately. I felt like a real Dick Tracy. Her Bio said she was a junior at the university, studying fine arts with a focus on 40‚Äôs Abstract Expressionism.

I scrolled through her profile. Pictures of her artwork featuring streaks of bold colors and unique textures. Photos of her out with friends at coffee shops and campus events. Her style was definitely more subdued, but I kind of liked that. She mostly opted for a pair of jeans and a graphic t-shirt. She also seemed to be fond of a particular dark green military jacket, most likely thrifted. It appeared in almost every other post. She seemed to save the dresses and jewelry for special occasions. I kept scrolling to find a few more selfies and even one with her wearing a Lou Reed shirt. The nineteen year-old version of me is currently a bit more rational, but a couple years ago I would have fallen head over heels for this girl in a heartbeat.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve changed as much as I like to think I have.

My eyes kept darting over my shoulder, as if someone was going to catch me in some perverted act. But I wasn‚Äôt necessarily doing anything wrong. At least I don‚Äôt think so. Her profile is public, so obviously she‚Äôs okay with people looking her up. Everyone searches their crushes on social media, right? It's practically expected these days.

As I pressed my thumb against the screen to swipe back, I must have held it just a second too long because I accidentally pressed a button on the top of her page. I followed her. My heart sank to my stomach as I quickly pressed the ‚ÄòUnfollow‚Äô prompt only a second after it had changed.

*Fuck‚Ä¶ you dumb ass.* I thought to myself, taking a deep breath. *It‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no way she saw it that quickly.* I slammed my phone down on the side table and hoped a good night‚Äôs sleep would rid this embarrassment from my body.  
  
That was when the scratching began again.

I woke up this morning in desperate need of caffeine, I opened my fridge to find an empty space where my energy drinks should‚Äôve been. I could‚Äôve swore I had at least two left, but between my lack of sleep and late night gaming binges, I didn‚Äôt put it past myself to have mindlessly finished them off. This meant a trip down to Mando‚Äôs, the small bodega just around the corner. Walking out, I reached for my keys on the hook behind the door and grasped at nothing but air. *Damn it*, I thought. I left them in the kitchen the night before. But I told myself it was only a block away, and I'd be back in less than five minutes‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt need them.

Mando‚Äôs was one of those cramped little stores that still somehow manages to stock everything a drunk college student might need at 2AM. The clerk, a guy who looked to be in his forties with tired eyes, barely looked up from his phone when I walked in. His long brown hair hung like curtains, hiding most of his face. Multiple piercings and tattoos were scattered across his body without much cohesion.

""Just this,"" I said, placing two drinks on the counter.

He scanned them without enthusiasm. ""Six fifty.""

I handed him exact change and was heading for the door when he called after me.

""You live in the building on Maple Street, right? The brick one?""

I turned back, surprised. ""Yeah, how'd you know?""

""See you walking by sometimes. You're new, right?""

It was a bit unsettling to know someone was keeping tabs on me without my knowledge. I replied, ""Few months now.""

He nodded. ‚ÄúYou seen anything ‚Ä¶ strange since you‚Äôve moved in?‚Äù

I thought about the scratching in my walls. Part of me wanted to tell him, but the other, louder part, didn‚Äôt want to look like a raving lunatic. ‚ÄúNot really‚Ä¶‚Äù I responded. I knew it was probably just rats anyway.

His eyebrow raised. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was out of curiosity or judgment. ‚ÄúNothing? Damn.‚Äù His face shifted to disappointment. I‚Äôm assuming he saw the confusion on my face because he continued unprompted, ‚ÄúThat building used to be an old mental institution before they built the college here. The *last* guy who lived in your unit said he could still hear the screams of patients when he was trying to sleep.‚Äù He let out a light chuckle as he finished the sentence. An unsettling smile grew across his face. ‚ÄúSaid he could feel the eyes of the orderlies and doctors glaring at him from the dark corners of the room you don‚Äôt pay attention to. The sounds of patients desperately trying to claw their way out through the walls.‚Äù 

I froze, t*he scratching‚Ä¶* ‚ÄúThe last guy?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYeah, haven‚Äôt seen him for a couple of months so I assume he must‚Äôve finally left. Dude seemed a little wacko, but hell if he didn‚Äôt come in here with some good stories.‚Äù The tone in his voice implied that I should come back with a better tale next time.

  
I hesitated to tell him about my experiences, how I had also heard the scratching sounds late at night. I quickly decided that it wasn‚Äôt worth the fifteen minute conversation it would turn into. At least not right now. ‚ÄúSorry. It‚Äôs been pretty quiet since I‚Äôve moved in.‚Äù

He shrugged and retreated back into his phone. I thanked him and headed outside, but his words stuck with me. The previous tenant had felt watched too...

As I approached my building, I spotted the silhouette of someone sitting on the steps leading up to the second floor apartments. I stepped closer and the figure became more clear. It was the girl from the window‚ÄîAnna. She was wearing that same green jacket I'd seen in her photos.

When she noticed me approaching, I felt this wave of embarrassment wash over me. I wanted to hurry past her without making eye contact, praying she hadn't somehow seen me looking at her the other night.

I was almost to my door when her voice stopped me.

""Are you the one who was peeping through my window the other night?""

I froze, the energy drinks suddenly feeling like they weighed a hundred pounds.

She was looking directly at me now, her expression more curious than angry. ""I live in 2B, second floor... Tuesday night, around eleven. You were by the dumpster and I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw you watching me.""

My face was burning. I wanted to deny it, to play dumb, to somehow make this conversation end. But she'd clearly seen me, and lying would only make it worse.

""I..."" I started, then stopped. How do you explain something like that without sounding like a complete creep? The honest answer felt impossible to say out loud.

""Well,"" I finally continued, ""your window was open.""

She stared at me for a moment, and I was sure she was about to tell me to stay away from her or threaten to call the cops. Instead, she started laughing.

""That's it? That's your excuse?""

""I mean, I stopped myself!"" I said quickly. ""I realized how weird it was and walked away. But yeah, for like ten seconds, I looked, and...‚Äù I trailed off, not sure how to finish that sentence without making it worse.

She laughed. ""At least you're honest,"" I was surprised to see she was still smiling. ""Most guys would have denied it completely or made up some dumb bull shit like ‚Äòoh I was admiring your posters‚Äô.

""There were posters?""

She shook her head and stood up, extending her hand toward me. ""I'm Anna, by the way.""

""Trevor. 1A."" I shook her hand, still not quite believing this conversation was happening. ""I'm really sorry about the... you know. Window thing. I swear I‚Äôm not normally like that. I haven‚Äôt made many friends since moving out here, and I think it‚Äôs messing with my head a little bit.""

""It's fine. Well, it's not really fine, but I appreciate the honesty. Just don‚Äôt do it again."" She smiled but her voice was stern. ‚ÄúAnd during the summer, this place really is a ghost town. I don‚Äôt blame you. I think we might be the only two people left in this building until August.‚Äù

We talked for a few more minutes and while most of it feels like a blur now, it must have went well because, before you know it, she had handed me her phone.  
  
""Put your number in. I'm going out with some friends tomorrow night - nothing fancy, just this arcade downtown. You should come.""

I entered my contact information, still slightly stunned that being caught peeping had somehow led to getting an invitation out.

""I'll text you the details,"" she said, pocketing her phone. She flashed me a smile that could melt Mount Everest and headed back up the stairs. ""See you tomorrow, Trevor from 1A.""

I watched her disappear around the corner of the building before realizing that I was still holding my energy drinks. I headed toward my unit, feeling lighter than I had in weeks. An actual conversation with another human being. Plans for tomorrow night. The possibility of friends‚Ä¶ maybe even more.

Placing one of the drinks under my right arm, I reached to open the front door.

It was locked.

I stood still for a moment, confused.

I tried the handle again, then checked the apartment number to make sure I was at the right door. 1A, just like always.

""What the hell?"" I muttered, checking my pockets before remembering that my keys were sitting on the counter inside. I couldn't have locked the door.

I froze. Paranoia told me there was someone, or something, in my apartment. I stepped to the right and leaned in toward the window that looks into my kitchen. My mind was racing with possibilities. They ranged from the ‚Äòlikely‚Äô to the ‚Äòabsolutely insane‚Äô and everywhere in between. *Did I close the door too hard and the bolt shut on it‚Äôs own? Did a homeless person get lucky checking door handles and is now holding himself up in my bedroom? Did one of the mental patients try to escape and the orderly locked the door before he reached it‚Ä¶?* As I peered through the window, I saw nothing out of the ordinary. There were my keys splayed across the counter. With no other option, I had to call my landlord.

Carl, the maintenance man, showed up twenty minutes later with his master key. He looked mildly annoyed at being called out so early, but tried to hide it for me.

""Just glad it's something simple,"" he said as he unlocked my door. ""Could have been a lot worse.""

""Does this happen with a lot of units?"" I asked, genuinely confused about how a door could lock itself.

""Not recently,"" he paused. ""Actually, the guy who lived here before you was a real piece of work. Always complaining about weird stuff. Said he heard voices in the walls, kept talking about ghosts and people watching him. Kept calling about his door being locked when he swore he hadn't locked it. Not just the front door though. Bedroom, Bathroom, you name it.""

The mention of the previous tenant caught my attention. ""What happened to him?""

""Oh, he was a nightmare. Wouldn't pay rent on time, did all these modifications to the apartment without approval. Kept drilling holes in the walls, and claimed it helped stop the voices. I think he even had a special name for his paranormal friends‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWallflowers‚Äù, that's it. Guy basically squatted here for almost a year before we could get him evicted.""

Carl pushed open my door and stepped inside before grabbing my keys off of the hook and throwing them to me. ""One day I showed up with the landlord to serve him papers and he was just... gone. Left most of his stuff, never came back for his deposit. Probably moved on to terrorize some other building.""

""Did you ever find anything in the apartment‚Ä¶ in the walls?""

Carl shrugged. ""Nothing. Far as I could tell, he was just paranoid. Maybe doing too many drugs, you know? Started seeing things that weren't there. But he swore up and down that someone was watching him.‚Äù

We exchanged our goodbyes as he headed out and I thanked him again for the help. It wasn‚Äôt until the door was closed and he was gone that the realization struck me. A cold bead of sweat dripped down my spine as I looked down at the keys in my hand. I had just seen my keys on the kitchen counter less than 20 minutes ago. Why were they hanging on the hook when Carl grabbed them?

I spent the next several hours searching every corner of the house. The idea that someone made their way inside while I was gone wouldn‚Äôt leave me. Even after checking every room, I felt the need to check them again. I kept imagining I was playing a sick game of musical chairs‚Äîthe squatter following behind me as I checked each room and hiding out in the one I had only just cleared. I did one more sweep of the rooms, this time in a different order. They wouldn‚Äôt outsmart if that was the case.  
  
I went Live about an hour later than usual tonight, finally convincing myself that I was home alone. Every room and closet was empty and every possible hiding spot was clear. But as soon as my stream started, something felt different.

I just went live and my viewer count is already at 1, like someone had been sitting there refreshing my page, waiting for me to start.

A notification was waiting for me in the chat.

1lkp5k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cant_sleep/comments/1lkp5k2/a_notebook_found_in_vostok/,A Notebook Found in Vostok,"Before you read this post, I want to preface that this is NOT my story, so the things that happen didn‚Äôt happen to me personally. Me and a few buddies are urban explorers; something we enjoy doing a lot. We were exploring a rumored abandoned town in Russia. I don‚Äôt think it had a name, so it will be known as Vostok. Vostok is deep in the far east of Russia, nestled between large mountains and dense forestry. The closest city to it (which we were at previously to even get here) is 300km+ away; or 180 miles+.¬†

Being in subarctic conditions, suffice it to say; it was really flippin cold. Just landing in Vladivostok was enough for me to regret my decision to come. We heard about the town from a Russian internet friend. We had to pay some local to take us to the town, which was fine because he had us drink in his house and chat. We didn‚Äôt really have to pay him much, he was just happy to do something rather than sit around I suppose. He did question why we were heading there though, not sure why? We brushed him off.

Anyways, it actually was pretty difficult to get to the town. I know I haven‚Äôt really said everything or described why it was, but trust me, you‚Äôll find out why. When we got to the town, it was abandoned as we hoped. In fact, I didn‚Äôt believe anyone had lived there in decades. In our time exploring we found a notebook in a power station at the outskirts of the town. The door leading in the building was broken and, on the ground, with very large claw marks on it. I thought it was a bear, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I was wrong.¬†

We didn‚Äôt stay too long at the town as it had begun to blizzard.¬†*In hindsight, that was probably a good idea.*¬†I‚Äôll write down everything that is in the Notebook, from beginning to end. Maybe I'll give some thoughts during it, maybe not; there‚Äôs a lot to type, this might take me a few days to put together. Without saying too much, let‚Äôs just get into it.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Josef Markees. Me and some friends from my hometown got shit-faced and went for a late-night drive 3 moons ago. Our luck was not something we relied on. So, when our car broke down and we found ourselves stranded in the woods, surprise wasn't an emotion felt. John wanted to travel back to where we came from, but Alex, who wasn't entirely wasted (I blame him for our situation), said we were already too far out and would probably die trying.¬†

Whenever we all traveled, Alex liked being in tune with the locals. It was something he did so he could ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù or ‚Äútake in‚Äù the experience better. I'm sure it was just him trying to get laid. Having spoken a bit with the locals though, or, specifically one local, he heard about an abandoned town that shouldn‚Äôt be too far from where we were located. Apparently, he heard about it because of a local legend, I can‚Äôt recall what it was about. Something about Soviet Scientists & Military. I‚Äôm sure that the legends were mostly told by youth the more he talked about it.

We didn‚Äôt really have much of a choice since we were impaired and absolutely freezing. We brought clothes that would help us fight the bitter cold here, but the nighttime was a different story. We already had stuff in the back of the car. Some of it was rock climbing equipment (It was a fun hobby of mine), some of it was cave diving equipment from Jimmy and John, and the rest was different survival equipment since Ajax was deathly scared of dying out in the middle of nowhere‚Ä¶ like right now.

We couldn‚Äôt carry all of the equipment since there was a lot of it, but we grabbed enough. Alex and John lead the way with our half-charged flashlights. When I say it was painfully cold, it‚Äôs an understatement. Just the time it took to discuss what to do already left me numb and shaky. It only took a bit before reaching this secret. I didn‚Äôt even realize we arrived since it was so dark and there were zero lights on.¬†

Apparently, we had entered the building before I could think about how we were in the town.

I didn‚Äôt know until morning, but it was an old train station. I don‚Äôt know the last time it was in use; it doesn‚Äôt really matter. What did matter though was that the building had power. It was a very nice feeling to have. Inside was very dusty. Opening the door was very loud, I was glad there wasn't a crazy recluse waiting for someone to enter their abode and pounce. Alex and John quickly searched the building while the rest of us caught our breaths, disturbing the air to the brink of no recovery. After a bit, they came back and found an old heater that still worked in a break room.

The rest of the night was a blur, but we got through fine it seemed. In the morning, we all drank some water we had in the bags, which wasn't a lot, then discussed our plan. Brighton suggested that we could wait and wave someone down at the road, but Alex shut that idea down, saying there was only one road that led into the town and nobody drives over here. The group started trying to figure a way out. I couldn‚Äôt keep up since I drank so much last night and my head was killing me, so I went outside.

The sky was colorless and gray, like it has been since we got here. It was quite cold outside. Inside wasn't much better, but the old furnace sufficed. The town was very quiet. There was no smoke from any homes, no tracks on the ground, it snowed slightly over last night, but still. There isn‚Äôt even any birdsong or any sort of animals for that matter. Or people.

Before I could finish my thoughts that were running like a faucet, the group came outside. Alex said he and John were heading back to the car to check if it might be fixable, until then just stay about. Brighton warned them to be careful, that there might be some dangerous wildlife around. John jokingly said back ‚ÄúHe felt better in the wilderness than this town‚Äù, to Brighton's unamusement. Alex and John trekked their way back to the car, retracing their barely visible tracks. We all watched them vanish off in the distance before Jimmy turned and went back into the building, we soon followed as well.

For a bit, we all just sat in the lounge, Jimmy saying how insane all this is and Brighton talking about how stupid we were for getting ourselves in this situation. Me on the other hand, was still too tired to comprehend how boned we really were. After a while longer, Brighton suggested we all go out and explore this town. Everyone seemed fine with it, including me, but I stayed out to dance with sleep some more. They were ok with that and headed out, I went back into the break room where the heater was, and slept.

I woke up when the group came back, they weren‚Äôt exactly quiet. They told me about the town square, some houses, and a general store. It had some food in it, most of it was rotten, but there were frozen canned goods. Brighton described how most of the places were preserved pretty well, most of the houses were left like they had never been abandoned.¬†

Brighton began writing the layout on some old parchment paper while Jimmy rambled on about how uneasy he felt, like he was being watched. Druggies. Ajax was quiet mostly throughout our banter, like usual. A few minutes later, I stopped and realized that Alex and John hadn't returned yet. The rest of the group found it strange as well. I took a look outside and also realized that the sky was beginning to dark, how long was I out for?

We decided to wait longer inside the station, despite Jimmy‚Äôs protests. That was a good idea, because 30 or so minutes later, Alex and John did return. Alex had John's arm around his shoulder, John had twisted his ankle on the way back. He sat him down and relayed the info they got. ‚ÄúThe car's finished,‚Äù Alex said. ‚ÄúCompletely gone. Not just frozen, something's fried. Fuel‚Äôs no good either, thick, sludgy.‚Äù, ""Everything‚Äôs wrong with it,"" John added. ""It just... died\*.\* Like it wanted to.""¬†

Nightfall came quicker than expected, most of us remained quiet, with occasional suggestions of what to do, mostly shot down by rationality. We ate some protein bars and canned goods we had left over. It was a sad night. The Station grew darker and colder. The last thing I remember last night was Jimmy saying. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre stuck, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The night felt longer than the others. Maybe because the cold got worse.¬†

Maybe because of the footsteps.¬†

Around midnight, Brighton thought she heard someone walking outside. I also thought I heard it too. Slow steps, heavy. Crunching like someone dragging their boots deliberately. We checked the windows.¬†

No movement. No figures.¬†

I tried to laugh it off. It didn‚Äôt land. We waited longer, but heard nothing else. Brighton found a locked hatch in the main hallway. Steel and heavy. It was covered with a rug, one we definitely moved before, and somehow‚Ä¶ missed? Ajax said he didn‚Äôt like it. Kept saying it ‚Äúfelt off.‚Äù No one opened it. Not yet.

Something else happened.¬†

I haven‚Äôt told anyone.

I probably should‚Äôve.

I felt something. Tight. Heavy. Like someone was still standing just beyond the window outside.¬†

I had goosebumps all up and down my body, something I hadn‚Äôt noticed until Ajax pointed it out himself how he had some too.

I didn‚Äôt move. I just sat there, listening, barely breathing. Then I looked across the room. Alex was asleep. On the floor. His coat draped over him, hand tucked under his head. He didn‚Äôt move once. Brighton and Ajax were chilling together, drinking some hot drinks.

I didn‚Äôt dream of it. I don‚Äôt think I didn‚Äôt? Maybe sleep deprivation messes with you. Maybe the stress of the situation is getting to me a little bit. I feel too nauseous to think straight. I‚Äôm heading to bed again.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I woke up early again this morning. I think it‚Äôs 6 or 7 in the morning, can‚Äôt exactly tell. I wish we brung phones. Everyone was still asleep except Brighton. I checked the whole place and couldn‚Äôt find her. I went outside and past the hatch on the ground, it made my skin crawl like there were bugs in them. As I went to open the door, it opened itself. My heart flatlined for a few I‚Äôm pretty sure.¬†

It was Brighton.

She looked equally as scared by my presence. Laughing it off though, she mentioned how she had to use the bathroom. I noticed she had a nose bleed, and mentioned something about‚Ä¶ womanly things, she didn‚Äôt like that. She wiped the blood off her face with the hem of her sleeve, then walked into the Ticket Office. She called me into it and showed me a map on the wall.

She expressed her feeling of frustration working on the map outside while there was one in here the entire time. I laughed a little at that. The map on the wall looked pretty old and dated. It said some words in Russian, I don‚Äôt speak it, so much of it was just nonsense to me. It did have the date 1978 on it though. It clearly had the town's layout on it and some train routes.¬†

The train station had three tracks. One inbound that headed out to the West and East, the one East splitting into 2, one continuing East and one heading South. Under it it says something in Russia, then a date marked as 1986. I‚Äôm not sure what it is about. There is also a barely-visible overlay beneath the Station and extending East. More words I don‚Äôt understand, but there is an outline marked in red. One of the labels next to it was scratched out too.¬†

This definitely was not part of the Stations map, but later added or repurposed.

At the end of the rail lines, they all were marked with a red X. Two of them say something in Russian and one is marked with the number ‚Äú17‚Äù. In the top left corner of the map lay a faded railway seal. But in the bottom right, a smaller emblem, a five-pointed star with no text, almost like a branding mark. Possibly military, or internal security.

We stood side by side, studying that old diagram like it might change if we looked hard enough.

She pointed first, the red square beneath the eastern quarter of the town. No label, just thick lines, thicker than anything else on the map. Bold, permanent, like whoever drew it wanted to make sure no one accidentally missed it.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right under the station,‚Äù she said.

I added the fact that. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the one in the hallway, where we found the hatch.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

There was another silence. Comfortable, at first. Then not.

We compared the map to her sketches that she had drawn yesterday. At least two buildings marked didn‚Äôt exist anymore, she mentioned. One might have collapsed. One‚Äôs just... gone. Like it never was. The red square connects to a dozen smaller paths. One ends right beneath the administrative building. Another dives deep under the forest edge.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they built this town around the station,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúThey built it around whatever‚Äôs under it.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt talk after that. Just stood there, tracing lines with our eyes. Pretending as if we are uncovering something we‚Äôre not supposed to.

The others started to stir. The room was cold enough to see your breath again. I was still in the ticket office, Brighton leaning against the far wall. Neither of us had moved much. Ajax was first. Quiet, still bleary eyed. Jimmy sat up next, rubbing his face like he‚Äôd just had a nightmare he couldn‚Äôt remember. John didn‚Äôt say a word. Just checked his ankle, winced, and went back to pretending to be asleep. Alex met us in the hallway between the lounge and the ticket office. He could tell something had changed. Brighton gestured for him to come look.

We waited until they were all gathered. All of us stood around that aging map like we were reading a eulogy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more underneath,‚Äù Brighton said. ‚ÄúThe station, the town, it‚Äôs all built over something else.‚Äù ‚ÄúTunnels,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúStorage. Labs. Something marked in Russian\*.\* It‚Äôs all here.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt react at first.

Jimmy blinked hard. Ajax looked at the map, then at me, then back again, like he didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge it. John muttered something incoherent. Alex stayed quiet the longest. He kept glancing between the map and the hallway, like he was working through equations no one else could see.

‚ÄúYou think that hatch leads down into it?‚Äù he asked. Brighton nodded. ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why don‚Äôt we open it?‚Äù

No one answered.

Jimmy finally broke the silence with something that made everyone pause.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I think we‚Äôre not supposed to.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt being dramatic. His voice was low, resigned. Like he‚Äôd accepted it long ago and just hadn‚Äôt said it out loud yet. I looked back at the hallway. I couldn‚Äôt see the hatch from where I stood, but I swear I felt it. Like it was listening.

We didn‚Äôt open it today either.

But it‚Äôs there.

And it‚Äôs waiting.

The rest of the day was still. Strangely still. Like the town knew we‚Äôd found something and was giving us time to sit with it. No voices. No strange sounds. No shifting shadows or disappearing tools. Almost peaceful‚Ä¶ Almost.

We stayed indoors, rationed food, rotated who kept the fire stoked. Brighton redrew the tunnel map from memory. Ajax made tea that tasted like moldy cardboard, but no one complained. Alex spent a lot of time standing at the station‚Äôs front window, hands in his pockets, watching the sky. Late afternoon, he finally spoke up.¬†

‚ÄúThe pressure‚Äôs dropping fast,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTemperature too. We‚Äôre in for something bad. Maybe tonight. Maybe tomorrow.‚Äù No one questioned how he knew all this.

He didn‚Äôt say blizzard, but we all felt it behind his words.

Jimmy asked if we could hike out before it hit. Alex shook his head.

‚ÄúThe snow‚Äôs too deep now. Tracks are gone. Landmarks too.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what then?‚Äù John asked. ‚ÄúWait it out?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf it turns into whiteout conditions,‚Äù Alex said, ‚Äúthis station probably won‚Äôt hold enough heat to keep us alive.‚Äù

He looked at Brighton, then me.

‚ÄúThat hatch leads somewhere. If it‚Äôs insulated... shielded... it might be warmer below ground. At least long enough to survive the worst of it.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt want to say it. But he did.¬†

And for the first time, no one argued. We didn‚Äôt open it. Not yet. But we know now. If the storm comes, we‚Äôll go down.

God help us.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We left just before sunset. Ajax and me.

I didn‚Äôt ask for permission. Just told them we‚Äôd be back soon. Brighton looked up from her sketchbook and said nothing. John scoffed and tightened the blanket around his shoulders. Alex gave one of those long sighs that says more than words ever could. Jimmy actually said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù Twice.

I left anyway. I needed to move. Sitting too long with the same faces, in the same gray walls, breathing the same breath‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like the place itself starts to compress you. Ajax came without hesitation. I think he‚Äôs started to follow me because he doesn‚Äôt know what else to do.

We took the south path, past the broken post office and a blackened fountain. The town's still wrong, silent in the way towns and cities aren‚Äôt supposed to be. No birds. No wind through wires. Just that wet, soft, shff shff of our boots through slush.

We didn‚Äôt speak much.

We found a collapsed building with burned siding and a half-buried sign. Russian letters still intact, –£–ß–ï–ë–ù–´–ô –ö–û–†–ü–£–°. Maybe a school once? The air inside was stale, but not frozen. Like the cold didn‚Äôt fully want to enter.

We found nothing of use. Just desks, broken chairs, and a room filled with ruined books, water-damaged beyond recognition. Ajax picked one up and flipped through the pulpy mush anyway. Said it felt wrong to ignore them. We didn‚Äôt stay long. I kept thinking I heard a second set of steps, out of sync with our own. Just slightly behind. Just slightly off.

By the time we returned to the station, it was nearly dark. They didn‚Äôt greet us. Brighton was adding another log to the stove. Alex kept his eyes outside the window. Jimmy sat with his arms crossed. John didn‚Äôt look at us at all.

‚ÄúAnything?‚Äù Alex finally asked. I shook my head. ‚ÄúNothing worth freezing over.‚Äù He nodded. But the feeling of tension didn‚Äôt lift.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It started maybe an hour ago.

A sound too faint for most of us to notice at first. Not wind. Not creaking wood. Something under the floor. At first it was distant. A low grind or drag, like rock being shifted against other rock. Then it paused. Then it started again, slower, heavier and rhythmic.

Alex stayed silent. He had his notebook out and was writing equations or weather models or something, I don‚Äôt know. Brighton stood still with her hand against the wall, eyes closed. Jimmy moved away from the boards. Ajax didn‚Äôt. He just sat there, eyes wide, staring at the stove like he was trying to keep his breath from fogging the air too much.

A few minutes later we heard a thump, not under us, but outside. Not footsteps. An emergence. Like something was breaking the surface or being released\*.\* No one moved for a long time. We just listened. Then Ajax spoke.

‚ÄúThere was a hole,‚Äù he said. I hummed, in a questioning tone ""Back near the road. On the edge of town. When we were out earlier.‚Äù Why didn‚Äôt you say anything?‚Äù I asked. ""It didn‚Äôt look fresh. I thought it was just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat kind of hole?‚Äù Brighton asked. He looked very nervous, very‚Ä¶ unlike him. ""Not a crater. A tunnel. Like something‚Ä¶ dug out. From the ground.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe there are people here?‚Äù Jimmy said with hope.

Everyone‚Äôs quiet again now. The boards have stopped. But the quiet is too clean.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Again. This time, it wasn‚Äôt the wind or Ajax or the cold. It was the silence. Too silent\*.\* Like something just past the edge of hearing had paused to listen back.

I found Alex standing by the ticket office window. He hadn‚Äôt lit a lamp. Just stood there, arms crossed, watching the snow shift like sand under a frozen moon. We didn‚Äôt speak for a while. Then he said:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of days.‚Äù I questioned him on what he meant.

‚ÄúThe weather's closing. Not like a blizzard, not yet, but worse than before. The sky has lost all visibility. The snow‚Äôs layering fast. Temperatures are dropping below survivable margin. By the time of tomorrow, we‚Äôll be sealed in and frozen.‚Äù

I tried to convince him that we should ditch the town, that we could survive the trek back to the closest city. If we just try to leave, head West, maybe, hike blind.

‚ÄúWith John's ankle? With Jimmy as shaky? No. We'd die in half a mile.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt respond. Not for a minute or two. I just looked out the window where the snow drifted up against the broken and rusted gate. He doesn‚Äôt even make sense to me.

‚ÄúAlex,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong with this place.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúI know you want to think it‚Äôs just pressure, or cold, or isolation, but‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs something under us. Something real. I felt it tonight. In the walls. Under the floor.‚Äù He turned to me slowly.

‚ÄúWhat are you saying?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs something in those tunnels. People maybe? Something that‚Äôs still alive at the least.‚Äù

Alex looked tired. Older than he did yesterday. Like the math and maps weren‚Äôt working anymore. He tried convincing me I was sleep deprived and other shit, I wasn't having it ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm not.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing here, Josef!‚Äù He let out a sort of whisper yell.

I didn‚Äôt say anything after that. I didn‚Äôt want to. I think he was trying to convince himself more than me. But I did see his eyes flick toward the hallway where the hatch is. Just for a second.

I think he‚Äôs scared too.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We‚Äôve stopped pretending we‚Äôll leave soon.

It wasn‚Äôt said outright, no official vote or discussion, but we all knew by the time breakfast was over. The look Brighton gave the boarded window. The way John didn't bother checking his ankle. Even Jimmy didn't ask about leaving today. That‚Äôs how you know. We‚Äôre here. For a while. So we made a list.

Alex suggested we split up and check the buildings we haven‚Äôt searched yet, ""Properly this time,‚Äù he said. Not just poking around and hoping to find a dusty can of peas. Real searching.

We divided into pairs:

Alex and Brighton: heading east, toward the old residential row.

Jimmy and Ajax: toward what looks like an old medical outpost near the square.

John stayed behind, ankle still bad. Said he‚Äôd reinforce the window coverings and ration out the food we already have.

I went alone. Just for a bit. I needed the silence.

There‚Äôs a stillness in the town this morning that isn‚Äôt peaceful. Snow still falls, light, like flour sifted from the clouds, but nothing else moves. Still no birds. Still no rustle of wind. Not even an echo. The buildings groan sometimes, old wood shifting under its own weight. But that‚Äôs it.

Found a storehouse. Mostly rotted through. Inside were boxes of rusted tools, water-damaged paper, one tin of coffee long expired, and a dented can marked in Russian, ‚Äú–ú–Ø–°–û‚Äù. It was meat. Might still be good? I‚Äôll give it to John. He‚Äôll know what to do with it.

Passed the hatch on the way back. Still shut. Still wrong. Brighton says we should keep inventory of anything strange, sounds, smells, things moved. She‚Äôs starting to feel it too, I think. We‚Äôll regroup at noon and decide if we need to start burning furniture. The storm hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. I‚Äôm going to bed.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------John says his ankle is broken now. No hesitation, no fuss.

I believe him.

This morning he brushed it off, tightened his laces, and kept the pain behind his teeth. But now he can barely stand, even with the help of a chair and Jimmy‚Äôs makeshift splint. It is swollen bad, purplish and fat around the bone.

He tried to joke about it. He didn‚Äôt even laugh. ‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôm not going anywhere,‚Äù he muttered, like we were still pretending he might.

We weren‚Äôt.

Alex came back with scraps of dry wood from one of the abandoned homes. He said the wind was starting to twist. Not strong yet, but low, curling, like it‚Äôs being funneled in from every side. The sky looks bruised. Faint flurries started around noon and haven‚Äôt stopped.

The snow is falling even faster now.

Jimmy‚Äôs quiet. Ajax is jittery again. Keeps chewing the insides of his cheeks. We took stock of the food. We might have maybe five, six days left if we stretch it. Ajax found old crackers sealed in wax paper from what might‚Äôve been a military pantry. Brighton checked the old first-aid tins. Most of the meds are useless. One bandage is still sealed. Morphine vials cracked in the cold.

Then the radio turned on.

None of us touched it. We didn‚Äôt even know it WAS a radio. It looked like a broken comms box mounted in the far corner of the waiting room, corroded, half-covered by a dusty coat. It screeched once. Loud enough to make Ajax drop his mug.

It was saying something, definitely in Russian. It would say something for a second, then leave for a few more, then start back up again. The voice was warped like a recording played underwater. Too fast, too slow, skipping like a bad tape deck.

Then it cut off. Static. Silence. Then nothing at all.

No one spoke for almost a minute.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no power in that corner,‚Äù Brighton finally said. ‚ÄúNo antenna either,‚Äù Alex added. ‚ÄúThat box shouldn't even function?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. My head was pounding. It started a few moments before the radio came alive and hasn't gone away. A pressure behind my eyes, like altitude sickness but denser. And it's still there now, as I write.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sorry for the interruption. This part was really hard to write down, I might have missed a few words or got them wrong, his handwriting is really shaky and messy. I have class in 30 minutes, so I tried to get this entry down quickly as well.**¬†

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We lost Ajax.

We didn‚Äôt even notice.

He said he had to piss. Mumbled it, half-asleep, grabbing his coat with one arm while fumbling for a flashlight with the other. No one really acknowledged it. We were all crashing, heads heavy, fire low, brains fogged from hunger and cold.

Alex looked up briefly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go far,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Ajax said. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt come back.

We don‚Äôt know how long it was. Maybe twenty minutes. Maybe longer. I only noticed when the lights flickered, once, twice‚Ä¶ then died.

Everything snapped to black.

No more hum from the utility closet. No more stove heat. Just the wind outside, rising louder.¬†

I tried to pretend it wasn't real. The low shifting. Beneath the floor, like something dragging heavy limbs through gravel, slow and patient.

Alex was first to say something.

‚ÄúEveryone below, now!‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt argue. Just grabbed bags and flashlights, pulled open the hatch, and climbed into the dark. The stairs were steep. Stone and cold. Brighton counted us down to the bottom.

‚ÄúWait, Where‚Äôs Ajax?‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember who said it

But it hit all at once.

We shouted. Searched upstairs. Nothing. No tracks in the snow, the wind had swept everything away. No trail. No Sight. No sound.

Just‚Ä¶ gone.

Alex looked stricken. Not with guilt, I don‚Äôt think, but more like disbelief. Like someone had knocked the ground out from under his logic. Jimmy couldn‚Äôt sit still after that. He kept pacing. Mumbling. ‚ÄúHe was just here. ‚Äù Brighton whispered that he must‚Äôve gotten turned around. Maybe went to one of the other buildings? Maybe holed up to wait out the storm?

But I don‚Äôt believe that. I heard something outside when the lights went out. Not a scream. Just movement.

Final.

I think Ajax is gone.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs down here with us, if there is? But we‚Äôre in it now. The hatch is closed. The cold has sealed us from exiting, afraid of death.

It‚Äôs colder down here, deeper. I'm starting to wonder if this was a good idea at all.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It‚Äôs day 5 I think? I don‚Äôt remember. We are underground. And Ajax is still gone.

They‚Äôve all convinced themselves he‚Äôs holed up somewhere. Maybe in a house with a fireplace, maybe the old clinic. Maybe we‚Äôll find him when the storm clears. But I don‚Äôt believe that.

We turned the power on within the first hour of being down here. There‚Äôs a rusted breaker panel just beyond the stairs. Alex opened it like he already knew what to look for. Three switches. All clearly labeled in Russian: ""–°–í–ï–¢""\*, ""\*–û–¢–û–ü–õ–ï–ù–ò–ï""And ""–°–ò–°–¢–ï–ú–´ –ñ–ò–ó–ù–ï–û–ë–ï–°–ü–ï–ß–ï–ù–ò–Ø"".

He flipped all three. The lights buzzed like insects trapped in glass, but they came on, slow, flickering, loud. Then, the heat followed. Metallic and dry. It started circulating through ductwork that groaned for quite some time before settling into a dull hum. The warmth was instant relief, physical, at least. But the air down here is‚Ä¶ old. It was time to see what was down here.

# The Tunnels

They don‚Äôt look like maintenance corridors. They‚Äôre far more elaborate than that.

Concrete walls painted beige once, but long since peeled into cracked scabs. Red lines run horizontally at shoulder height, like guides. Every fifty feet or so, Russian stencils mark sections: –ó–û–ù–ê 1-–ê, –ó–û–ù–ê 2-–ë, –ê–†–•–ò–í, –•–†–ê–ù–ò–õ–ò–©–ï, and occasionally, –ü–†–û–°–ú–û–¢–†.

The ceilings are low enough to make John duck in places. Pipes crisscross above, wrapped in old thermal sheathing. Some are hissing gently, and others drip.

The smell is layered. It‚Äôs dusty, but like, dense and sterile, like powdered chalk. Oil and rust are prominent too, it attacks you like a sharpie you‚Äôve inhaled for too long. But underneath it all, something like wet meat left on metal, not strong enough to make me gag, but just enough to remind me how unwelcoming this place is. It‚Äôs always just a few degrees too warm. Enough to make you sweat if you stay in one place too long. The walls breathe, not literally, but the heat moves like a slow exhale, and it makes the rooms feel‚Ä¶ alive almost.

# The Rooms

We‚Äôve explored maybe six so far.

**Room A12**¬†‚Äì Some sort of records room. Inside has metal shelves lined with warped, rotted paper. Most of it is unreadable. One document sealed in plastic, labeled: –û–ü–´–¢ ‚Ññ17-–†: ""–ê–∫—É—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –∞–Ω–æ–º–∞–ª–∏—è"", It looks cool, like a secret document on something. We haven't opened it yet.

**Room A19 ‚Äì**¬†A bunking room? There are rows of thin steel-framed cots. Blankets stiff with mold. One cot has heavy straps bolted to it. Another had what looks like bite marks in the mattress. Not animal sized. Human-sized. Strange.

**Room B3**¬†‚Äì The Power room That‚Äôs where we got the heat and lights on. Still has a red phone mounted to the wall, tried it, it‚Äôs a deadline. Alex stared at it for a while.

**Room A4**¬†‚Äì Looks like an observation chamber of sorts? It has a one-way glass facing a small, empty cell. Dried blood smeared across the inner door. On the glass, someone had written, in black grease pencil, one word: ""–¢–ò–®–ò–ù–ê""We haven‚Äôt opened the double doors marked ‚Äú–ë–ï–ó–û–ü–ê–°–ù–û–°–¢–¨ ‚Äì –î–û–°–¢–£–ü –£–†–û–í–ù–Ø III –¢–û–õ–¨–ö–û.**‚Äù**¬†It has some sort of security thingy to it.

There are no windows. No clocks. Time isn‚Äôt a factor down here. The sounds echo in strange ways. Our footsteps come back wrong, late, sometimes too many. A cough from someone bounced off the walls and came back twice.

And then there‚Äôs this hum? Not the heaters, but something deeper. Subsonic. Like a far-off generator that isn‚Äôt part of the grid. We don't know how far the tunnels go. We‚Äôll keep exploring tomorrow.

They still think Ajax is waiting.¬† But I think something else is. And I think it's listening.

1lkp1e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1lkp1e9/a_notebook_found_in_vostok_pt_1/,A Notebook Found in Vostok Pt. 1,"Before you read this post, I want to preface that this is NOT my story, so the things that happen didn‚Äôt happen to me personally. Me and a few buddies are urban explorers; something we enjoy doing a lot. We were exploring a rumored abandoned town in Russia. I don‚Äôt think it had a name, so it will be known as Vostok. Vostok is deep in the far east of Russia, nestled between large mountains and dense forestry. The closest city to it (which we were at previously to even get here) is 300km+ away; or 180 miles+.¬†

Being in subarctic conditions, suffice it to say; it was really flippin cold. Just landing in Vladivostok was enough for me to regret my decision to come. We heard about the town from a Russian internet friend. We had to pay some local to take us to the town, which was fine because he had us drink in his house and chat. We didn‚Äôt really have to pay him much, he was just happy to do something rather than sit around I suppose. He did question why we were heading there though, not sure why? We brushed him off.

Anyways, it actually was pretty difficult to get to the town. I know I haven‚Äôt really said everything or described why it was, but trust me, you‚Äôll find out why. When we got to the town, it was abandoned as we hoped. In fact, I didn‚Äôt believe anyone had lived there in decades. In our time exploring we found a notebook in a power station at the outskirts of the town. The door leading in the building was broken and, on the ground, with very large claw marks on it. I thought it was a bear, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I was wrong.¬†

We didn‚Äôt stay too long at the town as it had begun to blizzard.¬†*In hindsight, that was probably a good idea.*¬†I‚Äôll write down everything that is in the Notebook, from beginning to end. Maybe I'll give some thoughts during it, maybe not; there‚Äôs a lot to type, this might take me a few days to put together. Without saying too much, let‚Äôs just get into it.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Josef Markees. Me and some friends from my hometown got shit-faced and went for a late-night drive 3 moons ago. Our luck was not something we relied on. So, when our car broke down and we found ourselves stranded in the woods, surprise wasn't an emotion felt. John wanted to travel back to where we came from, but Alex, who wasn't entirely wasted (I blame him for our situation), said we were already too far out and would probably die trying.¬†

Whenever we all traveled, Alex liked being in tune with the locals. It was something he did so he could ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù or ‚Äútake in‚Äù the experience better. I'm sure it was just him trying to get laid. Having spoken a bit with the locals though, or, specifically one local, he heard about an abandoned town that shouldn‚Äôt be too far from where we were located. Apparently, he heard about it because of a local legend, I can‚Äôt recall what it was about. Something about Soviet Scientists & Military. I‚Äôm sure that the legends were mostly told by youth the more he talked about it.

We didn‚Äôt really have much of a choice since we were impaired and absolutely freezing. We brought clothes that would help us fight the bitter cold here, but the nighttime was a different story. We already had stuff in the back of the car. Some of it was rock climbing equipment (It was a fun hobby of mine), some of it was cave diving equipment from Jimmy and John, and the rest was different survival equipment since Ajax was deathly scared of dying out in the middle of nowhere‚Ä¶ like right now.

We couldn‚Äôt carry all of the equipment since there was a lot of it, but we grabbed enough. Alex and John lead the way with our half-charged flashlights. When I say it was painfully cold, it‚Äôs an understatement. Just the time it took to discuss what to do already left me numb and shaky. It only took a bit before reaching this secret. I didn‚Äôt even realize we arrived since it was so dark and there were zero lights on.¬†

Apparently, we had entered the building before I could think about how we were in the town.

I didn‚Äôt know until morning, but it was an old train station. I don‚Äôt know the last time it was in use; it doesn‚Äôt really matter. What did matter though was that the building had power. It was a very nice feeling to have. Inside was very dusty. Opening the door was very loud, I was glad there wasn't a crazy recluse waiting for someone to enter their abode and pounce. Alex and John quickly searched the building while the rest of us caught our breaths, disturbing the air to the brink of no recovery. After a bit, they came back and found an old heater that still worked in a break room.

The rest of the night was a blur, but we got through fine it seemed. In the morning, we all drank some water we had in the bags, which wasn't a lot, then discussed our plan. Brighton suggested that we could wait and wave someone down at the road, but Alex shut that idea down, saying there was only one road that led into the town and nobody drives over here. The group started trying to figure a way out. I couldn‚Äôt keep up since I drank so much last night and my head was killing me, so I went outside.

The sky was colorless and gray, like it has been since we got here. It was quite cold outside. Inside wasn't much better, but the old furnace sufficed. The town was very quiet. There was no smoke from any homes, no tracks on the ground, it snowed slightly over last night, but still. There isn‚Äôt even any birdsong or any sort of animals for that matter. Or people.

Before I could finish my thoughts that were running like a faucet, the group came outside. Alex said he and John were heading back to the car to check if it might be fixable, until then just stay about. Brighton warned them to be careful, that there might be some dangerous wildlife around. John jokingly said back ‚ÄúHe felt better in the wilderness than this town‚Äù, to Brighton's unamusement. Alex and John trekked their way back to the car, retracing their barely visible tracks. We all watched them vanish off in the distance before Jimmy turned and went back into the building, we soon followed as well.

For a bit, we all just sat in the lounge, Jimmy saying how insane all this is and Brighton talking about how stupid we were for getting ourselves in this situation. Me on the other hand, was still too tired to comprehend how boned we really were. After a while longer, Brighton suggested we all go out and explore this town. Everyone seemed fine with it, including me, but I stayed out to dance with sleep some more. They were ok with that and headed out, I went back into the break room where the heater was, and slept.

I woke up when the group came back, they weren‚Äôt exactly quiet. They told me about the town square, some houses, and a general store. It had some food in it, most of it was rotten, but there were frozen canned goods. Brighton described how most of the places were preserved pretty well, most of the houses were left like they had never been abandoned.¬†

Brighton began writing the layout on some old parchment paper while Jimmy rambled on about how uneasy he felt, like he was being watched. Druggies. Ajax was quiet mostly throughout our banter, like usual. A few minutes later, I stopped and realized that Alex and John hadn't returned yet. The rest of the group found it strange as well. I took a look outside and also realized that the sky was beginning to dark, how long was I out for?

We decided to wait longer inside the station, despite Jimmy‚Äôs protests. That was a good idea, because 30 or so minutes later, Alex and John did return. Alex had John's arm around his shoulder, John had twisted his ankle on the way back. He sat him down and relayed the info they got. ‚ÄúThe car's finished,‚Äù Alex said. ‚ÄúCompletely gone. Not just frozen, something's fried. Fuel‚Äôs no good either, thick, sludgy.‚Äù, ""Everything‚Äôs wrong with it,"" John added. ""It just... died\*.\* Like it wanted to.""¬†

Nightfall came quicker than expected, most of us remained quiet, with occasional suggestions of what to do, mostly shot down by rationality. We ate some protein bars and canned goods we had left over. It was a sad night. The Station grew darker and colder. The last thing I remember last night was Jimmy saying. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre stuck, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The night felt longer than the others. Maybe because the cold got worse.¬†

Maybe because of the footsteps.¬†

Around midnight, Brighton thought she heard someone walking outside. I also thought I heard it too. Slow steps, heavy. Crunching like someone dragging their boots deliberately. We checked the windows.¬†

No movement. No figures.¬†

I tried to laugh it off. It didn‚Äôt land. We waited longer, but heard nothing else. Brighton found a locked hatch in the main hallway. Steel and heavy. It was covered with a rug, one we definitely moved before, and somehow‚Ä¶ missed? Ajax said he didn‚Äôt like it. Kept saying it ‚Äúfelt off.‚Äù No one opened it. Not yet.

Something else happened.¬†

I haven‚Äôt told anyone.

I probably should‚Äôve.

I felt something. Tight. Heavy. Like someone was still standing just beyond the window outside.¬†

I had goosebumps all up and down my body, something I hadn‚Äôt noticed until Ajax pointed it out himself how he had some too.

I didn‚Äôt move. I just sat there, listening, barely breathing. Then I looked across the room. Alex was asleep. On the floor. His coat draped over him, hand tucked under his head. He didn‚Äôt move once. Brighton and Ajax were chilling together, drinking some hot drinks.

I didn‚Äôt dream of it. I don‚Äôt think I didn‚Äôt? Maybe sleep deprivation messes with you. Maybe the stress of the situation is getting to me a little bit. I feel too nauseous to think straight. I‚Äôm heading to bed again.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I woke up early again this morning. I think it‚Äôs 6 or 7 in the morning, can‚Äôt exactly tell. I wish we brung phones. Everyone was still asleep except Brighton. I checked the whole place and couldn‚Äôt find her. I went outside and past the hatch on the ground, it made my skin crawl like there were bugs in them. As I went to open the door, it opened itself. My heart flatlined for a few I‚Äôm pretty sure.¬†

It was Brighton.

She looked equally as scared by my presence. Laughing it off though, she mentioned how she had to use the bathroom. I noticed she had a nose bleed, and mentioned something about‚Ä¶ womanly things, she didn‚Äôt like that. She wiped the blood off her face with the hem of her sleeve, then walked into the Ticket Office. She called me into it and showed me a map on the wall.

She expressed her feeling of frustration working on the map outside while there was one in here the entire time. I laughed a little at that. The map on the wall looked pretty old and dated. It said some words in Russian, I don‚Äôt speak it, so much of it was just nonsense to me. It did have the date 1978 on it though. It clearly had the town's layout on it and some train routes.¬†

The train station had three tracks. One inbound that headed out to the West and East, the one East splitting into 2, one continuing East and one heading South. Under it it says something in Russia, then a date marked as 1986. I‚Äôm not sure what it is about. There is also a barely-visible overlay beneath the Station and extending East. More words I don‚Äôt understand, but there is an outline marked in red. One of the labels next to it was scratched out too.¬†

This definitely was not part of the Stations map, but later added or repurposed.

At the end of the rail lines, they all were marked with a red X. Two of them say something in Russian and one is marked with the number ‚Äú17‚Äù. In the top left corner of the map lay a faded railway seal. But in the bottom right, a smaller emblem, a five-pointed star with no text, almost like a branding mark. Possibly military, or internal security.

We stood side by side, studying that old diagram like it might change if we looked hard enough.

She pointed first, the red square beneath the eastern quarter of the town. No label, just thick lines, thicker than anything else on the map. Bold, permanent, like whoever drew it wanted to make sure no one accidentally missed it.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right under the station,‚Äù she said.

I added the fact that. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the one in the hallway, where we found the hatch.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

There was another silence. Comfortable, at first. Then not.

We compared the map to her sketches that she had drawn yesterday. At least two buildings marked didn‚Äôt exist anymore, she mentioned. One might have collapsed. One‚Äôs just... gone. Like it never was. The red square connects to a dozen smaller paths. One ends right beneath the administrative building. Another dives deep under the forest edge.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they built this town around the station,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúThey built it around whatever‚Äôs under it.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt talk after that. Just stood there, tracing lines with our eyes. Pretending as if we are uncovering something we‚Äôre not supposed to.

The others started to stir. The room was cold enough to see your breath again. I was still in the ticket office, Brighton leaning against the far wall. Neither of us had moved much. Ajax was first. Quiet, still bleary eyed. Jimmy sat up next, rubbing his face like he‚Äôd just had a nightmare he couldn‚Äôt remember. John didn‚Äôt say a word. Just checked his ankle, winced, and went back to pretending to be asleep. Alex met us in the hallway between the lounge and the ticket office. He could tell something had changed. Brighton gestured for him to come look.

We waited until they were all gathered. All of us stood around that aging map like we were reading a eulogy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more underneath,‚Äù Brighton said. ‚ÄúThe station, the town, it‚Äôs all built over something else.‚Äù ‚ÄúTunnels,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúStorage. Labs. Something marked in Russian\*.\* It‚Äôs all here.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt react at first.

Jimmy blinked hard. Ajax looked at the map, then at me, then back again, like he didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge it. John muttered something incoherent. Alex stayed quiet the longest. He kept glancing between the map and the hallway, like he was working through equations no one else could see.

‚ÄúYou think that hatch leads down into it?‚Äù he asked. Brighton nodded. ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why don‚Äôt we open it?‚Äù

No one answered.

Jimmy finally broke the silence with something that made everyone pause.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I think we‚Äôre not supposed to.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt being dramatic. His voice was low, resigned. Like he‚Äôd accepted it long ago and just hadn‚Äôt said it out loud yet. I looked back at the hallway. I couldn‚Äôt see the hatch from where I stood, but I swear I felt it. Like it was listening.

We didn‚Äôt open it today either.

But it‚Äôs there.

And it‚Äôs waiting.

The rest of the day was still. Strangely still. Like the town knew we‚Äôd found something and was giving us time to sit with it. No voices. No strange sounds. No shifting shadows or disappearing tools. Almost peaceful‚Ä¶ Almost.

We stayed indoors, rationed food, rotated who kept the fire stoked. Brighton redrew the tunnel map from memory. Ajax made tea that tasted like moldy cardboard, but no one complained. Alex spent a lot of time standing at the station‚Äôs front window, hands in his pockets, watching the sky. Late afternoon, he finally spoke up.¬†

‚ÄúThe pressure‚Äôs dropping fast,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTemperature too. We‚Äôre in for something bad. Maybe tonight. Maybe tomorrow.‚Äù No one questioned how he knew all this.

He didn‚Äôt say blizzard, but we all felt it behind his words.

Jimmy asked if we could hike out before it hit. Alex shook his head.

‚ÄúThe snow‚Äôs too deep now. Tracks are gone. Landmarks too.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what then?‚Äù John asked. ‚ÄúWait it out?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf it turns into whiteout conditions,‚Äù Alex said, ‚Äúthis station probably won‚Äôt hold enough heat to keep us alive.‚Äù

He looked at Brighton, then me.

‚ÄúThat hatch leads somewhere. If it‚Äôs insulated... shielded... it might be warmer below ground. At least long enough to survive the worst of it.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt want to say it. But he did.¬†

And for the first time, no one argued. We didn‚Äôt open it. Not yet. But we know now. If the storm comes, we‚Äôll go down.

God help us.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We left just before sunset. Ajax and me.

I didn‚Äôt ask for permission. Just told them we‚Äôd be back soon. Brighton looked up from her sketchbook and said nothing. John scoffed and tightened the blanket around his shoulders. Alex gave one of those long sighs that says more than words ever could. Jimmy actually said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù Twice.

I left anyway. I needed to move. Sitting too long with the same faces, in the same gray walls, breathing the same breath‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like the place itself starts to compress you. Ajax came without hesitation. I think he‚Äôs started to follow me because he doesn‚Äôt know what else to do.

We took the south path, past the broken post office and a blackened fountain. The town's still wrong, silent in the way towns and cities aren‚Äôt supposed to be. No birds. No wind through wires. Just that wet, soft, shff shff of our boots through slush.

We didn‚Äôt speak much.

We found a collapsed building with burned siding and a half-buried sign. Russian letters still intact, –£–ß–ï–ë–ù–´–ô –ö–û–†–ü–£–°. Maybe a school once? The air inside was stale, but not frozen. Like the cold didn‚Äôt fully want to enter.

We found nothing of use. Just desks, broken chairs, and a room filled with ruined books, water-damaged beyond recognition. Ajax picked one up and flipped through the pulpy mush anyway. Said it felt wrong to ignore them. We didn‚Äôt stay long. I kept thinking I heard a second set of steps, out of sync with our own. Just slightly behind. Just slightly off.

By the time we returned to the station, it was nearly dark. They didn‚Äôt greet us. Brighton was adding another log to the stove. Alex kept his eyes outside the window. Jimmy sat with his arms crossed. John didn‚Äôt look at us at all.

‚ÄúAnything?‚Äù Alex finally asked. I shook my head. ‚ÄúNothing worth freezing over.‚Äù He nodded. But the feeling of tension didn‚Äôt lift.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It started maybe an hour ago.

A sound too faint for most of us to notice at first. Not wind. Not creaking wood. Something under the floor. At first it was distant. A low grind or drag, like rock being shifted against other rock. Then it paused. Then it started again, slower, heavier and rhythmic.

Alex stayed silent. He had his notebook out and was writing equations or weather models or something, I don‚Äôt know. Brighton stood still with her hand against the wall, eyes closed. Jimmy moved away from the boards. Ajax didn‚Äôt. He just sat there, eyes wide, staring at the stove like he was trying to keep his breath from fogging the air too much.

A few minutes later we heard a thump, not under us, but outside. Not footsteps. An emergence. Like something was breaking the surface or being released\*.\* No one moved for a long time. We just listened. Then Ajax spoke.

‚ÄúThere was a hole,‚Äù he said. I hummed, in a questioning tone ""Back near the road. On the edge of town. When we were out earlier.‚Äù Why didn‚Äôt you say anything?‚Äù I asked. ""It didn‚Äôt look fresh. I thought it was just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat kind of hole?‚Äù Brighton asked. He looked very nervous, very‚Ä¶ unlike him. ""Not a crater. A tunnel. Like something‚Ä¶ dug out. From the ground.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe there are people here?‚Äù Jimmy said with hope.

Everyone‚Äôs quiet again now. The boards have stopped. But the quiet is too clean.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Again. This time, it wasn‚Äôt the wind or Ajax or the cold. It was the silence. Too silent\*.\* Like something just past the edge of hearing had paused to listen back.

I found Alex standing by the ticket office window. He hadn‚Äôt lit a lamp. Just stood there, arms crossed, watching the snow shift like sand under a frozen moon. We didn‚Äôt speak for a while. Then he said:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of days.‚Äù I questioned him on what he meant.

‚ÄúThe weather's closing. Not like a blizzard, not yet, but worse than before. The sky has lost all visibility. The snow‚Äôs layering fast. Temperatures are dropping below survivable margin. By the time of tomorrow, we‚Äôll be sealed in and frozen.‚Äù

I tried to convince him that we should ditch the town, that we could survive the trek back to the closest city. If we just try to leave, head West, maybe, hike blind.

‚ÄúWith John's ankle? With Jimmy as shaky? No. We'd die in half a mile.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt respond. Not for a minute or two. I just looked out the window where the snow drifted up against the broken and rusted gate. He doesn‚Äôt even make sense to me.

‚ÄúAlex,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong with this place.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúI know you want to think it‚Äôs just pressure, or cold, or isolation, but‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs something under us. Something real. I felt it tonight. In the walls. Under the floor.‚Äù He turned to me slowly.

‚ÄúWhat are you saying?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs something in those tunnels. People maybe? Something that‚Äôs still alive at the least.‚Äù

Alex looked tired. Older than he did yesterday. Like the math and maps weren‚Äôt working anymore. He tried convincing me I was sleep deprived and other shit, I wasn't having it ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm not.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing here, Josef!‚Äù He let out a sort of whisper yell.

I didn‚Äôt say anything after that. I didn‚Äôt want to. I think he was trying to convince himself more than me. But I did see his eyes flick toward the hallway where the hatch is. Just for a second.

I think he‚Äôs scared too.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We‚Äôve stopped pretending we‚Äôll leave soon.

It wasn‚Äôt said outright, no official vote or discussion, but we all knew by the time breakfast was over. The look Brighton gave the boarded window. The way John didn't bother checking his ankle. Even Jimmy didn't ask about leaving today. That‚Äôs how you know. We‚Äôre here. For a while. So we made a list.

Alex suggested we split up and check the buildings we haven‚Äôt searched yet, ""Properly this time,‚Äù he said. Not just poking around and hoping to find a dusty can of peas. Real searching.

We divided into pairs:

Alex and Brighton: heading east, toward the old residential row.

Jimmy and Ajax: toward what looks like an old medical outpost near the square.

John stayed behind, ankle still bad. Said he‚Äôd reinforce the window coverings and ration out the food we already have.

I went alone. Just for a bit. I needed the silence.

There‚Äôs a stillness in the town this morning that isn‚Äôt peaceful. Snow still falls, light, like flour sifted from the clouds, but nothing else moves. Still no birds. Still no rustle of wind. Not even an echo. The buildings groan sometimes, old wood shifting under its own weight. But that‚Äôs it.

Found a storehouse. Mostly rotted through. Inside were boxes of rusted tools, water-damaged paper, one tin of coffee long expired, and a dented can marked in Russian, ‚Äú–ú–Ø–°–û‚Äù. It was meat. Might still be good? I‚Äôll give it to John. He‚Äôll know what to do with it.

Passed the hatch on the way back. Still shut. Still wrong. Brighton says we should keep inventory of anything strange, sounds, smells, things moved. She‚Äôs starting to feel it too, I think. We‚Äôll regroup at noon and decide if we need to start burning furniture. The storm hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. I‚Äôm going to bed.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------John says his ankle is broken now. No hesitation, no fuss.

I believe him.

This morning he brushed it off, tightened his laces, and kept the pain behind his teeth. But now he can barely stand, even with the help of a chair and Jimmy‚Äôs makeshift splint. It is swollen bad, purplish and fat around the bone.

He tried to joke about it. He didn‚Äôt even laugh. ‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôm not going anywhere,‚Äù he muttered, like we were still pretending he might.

We weren‚Äôt.

Alex came back with scraps of dry wood from one of the abandoned homes. He said the wind was starting to twist. Not strong yet, but low, curling, like it‚Äôs being funneled in from every side. The sky looks bruised. Faint flurries started around noon and haven‚Äôt stopped.

The snow is falling even faster now.

Jimmy‚Äôs quiet. Ajax is jittery again. Keeps chewing the insides of his cheeks. We took stock of the food. We might have maybe five, six days left if we stretch it. Ajax found old crackers sealed in wax paper from what might‚Äôve been a military pantry. Brighton checked the old first-aid tins. Most of the meds are useless. One bandage is still sealed. Morphine vials cracked in the cold.

Then the radio turned on.

None of us touched it. We didn‚Äôt even know it WAS a radio. It looked like a broken comms box mounted in the far corner of the waiting room, corroded, half-covered by a dusty coat. It screeched once. Loud enough to make Ajax drop his mug.

It was saying something, definitely in Russian. It would say something for a second, then leave for a few more, then start back up again. The voice was warped like a recording played underwater. Too fast, too slow, skipping like a bad tape deck.

Then it cut off. Static. Silence. Then nothing at all.

No one spoke for almost a minute.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no power in that corner,‚Äù Brighton finally said. ‚ÄúNo antenna either,‚Äù Alex added. ‚ÄúThat box shouldn't even function?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. My head was pounding. It started a few moments before the radio came alive and hasn't gone away. A pressure behind my eyes, like altitude sickness but denser. And it's still there now, as I write.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sorry for the interruption. This part was really hard to write down, I might have missed a few words or got them wrong, his handwriting is really shaky and messy. I have class in 30 minutes, so I tried to get this entry down quickly as well.**¬†

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We lost Ajax.

We didn‚Äôt even notice.

He said he had to piss. Mumbled it, half-asleep, grabbing his coat with one arm while fumbling for a flashlight with the other. No one really acknowledged it. We were all crashing, heads heavy, fire low, brains fogged from hunger and cold.

Alex looked up briefly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go far,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Ajax said. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt come back.

We don‚Äôt know how long it was. Maybe twenty minutes. Maybe longer. I only noticed when the lights flickered, once, twice‚Ä¶ then died.

Everything snapped to black.

No more hum from the utility closet. No more stove heat. Just the wind outside, rising louder.¬†

I tried to pretend it wasn't real. The low shifting. Beneath the floor, like something dragging heavy limbs through gravel, slow and patient.

Alex was first to say something.

‚ÄúEveryone below, now!‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt argue. Just grabbed bags and flashlights, pulled open the hatch, and climbed into the dark. The stairs were steep. Stone and cold. Brighton counted us down to the bottom.

‚ÄúWait, Where‚Äôs Ajax?‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember who said it

But it hit all at once.

We shouted. Searched upstairs. Nothing. No tracks in the snow, the wind had swept everything away. No trail. No Sight. No sound.

Just‚Ä¶ gone.

Alex looked stricken. Not with guilt, I don‚Äôt think, but more like disbelief. Like someone had knocked the ground out from under his logic. Jimmy couldn‚Äôt sit still after that. He kept pacing. Mumbling. ‚ÄúHe was just here. ‚Äù Brighton whispered that he must‚Äôve gotten turned around. Maybe went to one of the other buildings? Maybe holed up to wait out the storm?

But I don‚Äôt believe that. I heard something outside when the lights went out. Not a scream. Just movement.

Final.

I think Ajax is gone.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs down here with us, if there is? But we‚Äôre in it now. The hatch is closed. The cold has sealed us from exiting, afraid of death.

It‚Äôs colder down here, deeper. I'm starting to wonder if this was a good idea at all.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It‚Äôs day 5 I think? I don‚Äôt remember. We are underground. And Ajax is still gone.

They‚Äôve all convinced themselves he‚Äôs holed up somewhere. Maybe in a house with a fireplace, maybe the old clinic. Maybe we‚Äôll find him when the storm clears. But I don‚Äôt believe that.

We turned the power on within the first hour of being down here. There‚Äôs a rusted breaker panel just beyond the stairs. Alex opened it like he already knew what to look for. Three switches. All clearly labeled in Russian: ""–°–í–ï–¢""\*, ""\*–û–¢–û–ü–õ–ï–ù–ò–ï""And ""–°–ò–°–¢–ï–ú–´ –ñ–ò–ó–ù–ï–û–ë–ï–°–ü–ï–ß–ï–ù–ò–Ø"".

He flipped all three. The lights buzzed like insects trapped in glass, but they came on, slow, flickering, loud. Then, the heat followed. Metallic and dry. It started circulating through ductwork that groaned for quite some time before settling into a dull hum. The warmth was instant relief, physical, at least. But the air down here is‚Ä¶ old. It was time to see what was down here.

# The Tunnels

They don‚Äôt look like maintenance corridors. They‚Äôre far more elaborate than that.

Concrete walls painted beige once, but long since peeled into cracked scabs. Red lines run horizontally at shoulder height, like guides. Every fifty feet or so, Russian stencils mark sections: –ó–û–ù–ê 1-–ê, –ó–û–ù–ê 2-–ë, –ê–†–•–ò–í, –•–†–ê–ù–ò–õ–ò–©–ï, and occasionally, –ü–†–û–°–ú–û–¢–†.

The ceilings are low enough to make John duck in places. Pipes crisscross above, wrapped in old thermal sheathing. Some are hissing gently, and others drip.

The smell is layered. It‚Äôs dusty, but like, dense and sterile, like powdered chalk. Oil and rust are prominent too, it attacks you like a sharpie you‚Äôve inhaled for too long. But underneath it all, something like wet meat left on metal, not strong enough to make me gag, but just enough to remind me how unwelcoming this place is. It‚Äôs always just a few degrees too warm. Enough to make you sweat if you stay in one place too long. The walls breathe, not literally, but the heat moves like a slow exhale, and it makes the rooms feel‚Ä¶ alive almost.

# The Rooms

We‚Äôve explored maybe six so far.

**Room A12**¬†‚Äì Some sort of records room. Inside has metal shelves lined with warped, rotted paper. Most of it is unreadable. One document sealed in plastic, labeled: –û–ü–´–¢ ‚Ññ17-–†: ""–ê–∫—É—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –∞–Ω–æ–º–∞–ª–∏—è"", It looks cool, like a secret document on something. We haven't opened it yet.

**Room A19 ‚Äì**¬†A bunking room? There are rows of thin steel-framed cots. Blankets stiff with mold. One cot has heavy straps bolted to it. Another had what looks like bite marks in the mattress. Not animal sized. Human-sized. Strange.

**Room B3**¬†‚Äì The Power room That‚Äôs where we got the heat and lights on. Still has a red phone mounted to the wall, tried it, it‚Äôs a deadline. Alex stared at it for a while.

**Room A4**¬†‚Äì Looks like an observation chamber of sorts? It has a one-way glass facing a small, empty cell. Dried blood smeared across the inner door. On the glass, someone had written, in black grease pencil, one word: ""–¢–ò–®–ò–ù–ê""We haven‚Äôt opened the double doors marked ‚Äú–ë–ï–ó–û–ü–ê–°–ù–û–°–¢–¨ ‚Äì –î–û–°–¢–£–ü –£–†–û–í–ù–Ø III –¢–û–õ–¨–ö–û.**‚Äù**¬†It has some sort of security thingy to it.

There are no windows. No clocks. Time isn‚Äôt a factor down here. The sounds echo in strange ways. Our footsteps come back wrong, late, sometimes too many. A cough from someone bounced off the walls and came back twice.

And then there‚Äôs this hum? Not the heaters, but something deeper. Subsonic. Like a far-off generator that isn‚Äôt part of the grid. We don't know how far the tunnels go. We‚Äôll keep exploring tomorrow.

They still think Ajax is waiting.¬† But I think something else is. And I think it's listening.

Our general manager was informed about the situation but we almost forgot to tell our boss about the fact we can't use the bathrooms and sinks to wash our hands. The general manager kept us open despite being it is illegal for us to be open. From Eleven thirty am to third fourty five pm, I had to hold my waste in my body. I tried different methods to go suggested by my coworkers but, it didn't work and left with the pain and anguish of not able to use the bathroom. One of my regular customers allowed me to use the bathroom on the first floor of the near apartment complex.

Watching younger guys make the same mistakes I did, so here's what I wish someone had told me before I learned it the expensive way:

1. Your appearance matters way more than you think. Used to think ""looks don't matter, personality is everything."" That's half true but personality matters, but nobody gets close enough to see your personality if you look like you don't care about yourself. Started lifting weights, buying clothes that fit, and getting decent haircuts. People treat you completely differently. Not fair honestly but I had to live with it.
2. Most career advice is terrible. ""Follow your passion"" and ""do what you love"" sounds nice but pays terribly. Better advice: get good at something valuable, then find ways to enjoy it. Your dream job might be a nightmare with a boss and deadlines. Build skills that pay well first, then pursue passion projects on the side with actual money in the bank.
3. Networking isn't about using people. Spent years thinking networking was fake and sleazy. Turns out it's just being genuinely helpful to people in your field. Answer questions, share opportunities, make introductions. Most good jobs come through connections, not job boards. The guy who helped me get my current role? Met him in a random conversation at a coffee shop.
4. You can't negotiate from a position of weakness. Whether it's salary, relationships, or business deals - you need options to have leverage. Stay in shape so you're not desperate for any relationship. Keep your skills sharp so you're not desperate for any job. Save money so you're not desperate for any paycheck. Desperation kills your negotiating power.
5. Clean eating changes everything .Used to live on pizza, energy drinks, and whatever was convenient. Thought food was just fuel. Started eating actual meals with vegetables and protein. Energy levels stabilized, sleep improved, mood got better, even thinking got clearer. You literally are what you eat - choose accordingly.
6. Your 20s are for building, not consuming. Watched friends blow money on cars, clothes, and experiences while I was learning skills and saving. They looked cooler at 25, I look better at 32. Your 20s are when you have energy but no money. Use that energy to build skills, relationships, and savings. The fancy stuff can wait.
7. Most people don't think about you as much as you think Spent years worried about what others thought of my choices. Turns out most people are too busy worrying about their own stuff to judge yours. That embarrassing thing you did last week? They already forgot. Make decisions based on what's good for you, not what looks good to people who aren't living your life.
8. Confidence comes from competence. ""Just be confident"" is useless advice. Confidence comes from knowing you can handle what comes up. Get good at things that matter fixing problems, making money, staying healthy, building relationships. When you know you can figure stuff out, confidence becomes automatic.
9. Your mental health affects everything else. Used to think therapy was for ""weak"" people and just powered through stress and anxiety. Finally got help at 29. Wish I'd done it at 19. Your brain is like any other part of your body sometimes it needs maintenance. Taking care of your mental health isn't weakness but maintenance.
10. Quality beats quantity in almost everything Better to have 3 close friends than 30 acquaintances. Better to own 5 high-quality items than 50 cheap ones. Better to be great at 2 skills than mediocre at 10. Better to have one meaningful relationship than a bunch of casual ones. Focus your energy on fewer things and do them well. I realized this after how my friend who hone his skill for a decade got a into a big internship after I have applied for it a lot of times.

I hope this helps. I just wanted you guys to learn this lessons. Took me so long and I want to preach it more. So you guys don't go through what I did.

I‚Äôm looking for advice or even suggestions how I can help her carry in with her healthy ways.

She‚Äôs about 5‚Äô4‚Äù maybe like 120 pounds. She‚Äôs not trying a significant weight loss just more around the tummy. It‚Äôs one of those things called ‚Äú relationship weight‚Äù and it was my fault apparently haha‚Ä¶ 

A little about her, she works at an emergency hospital for animals and it‚Äôs always busy so she never packs a lunch, it‚Äôs a lot of snacking in peanuts, chocolate almond Etc because there no time and that‚Äôs all she has for 8 -12 hours of her shift.  

And when she gets home she makes her first meal of the day and that‚Äôs it. It cook me rice or ramen, with a protein and that‚Äôs basically it

She loves white rice and will kill for it. So I we agreed to keep that the same for our diet. We have transition from pork and beef to more chicken and fish. This is also helping her health as she‚Äôs on accutane and red meat really screws with her bloodwork.

I have been pushing her to go in more hikes(every weekend) and runs (4 times a week) and trying to find healthy recipes every week to support her, We both agreed to limit her McDonald‚Äôs addiction haha‚Ä¶ to just ice coffee.

I been inviting her out to my runs 4 days a week, we hike every weekend.  And that‚Äôs probably the most work out tbh. 

Is there anything else I could do to help her?

She‚Äôs been looking at dieting pills or teas and I been telling her, those aren‚Äôt heathy. And been telling her if she puts in the effort she‚Äôll be rewarded and feel better than being in those pills. ",0,1750905048.0,loseit,10,0.4,False
1lkor1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lkor1n/the_dream_of_endless_golden_crosses_part_2/,The Dream of Endless Golden Crosses. Part 2,"Chapter 2:

Standing before the heart of the city, I stared into the golden glow of our fake sun. But it wasn't a ball of light when I first thought, the light goes on seemingly forever to each side. It's hard to tell if it's a mighty wall to protect what's inside, or a dome to keep something from escaping. It didn't stop me from entering nor leaving, the blinding light creates a challenge for the seeing if that's what counts as it's way to stop those who dares approach. Regardless of my sight or what this brilliant glow intent, I venture towards where my city should be. My footsteps were loud, being left in a deaf world makes creaks and rustle sound like thunder and earthquakes. My heartbeat was calm, beating like it should. But each pump feels like it could shake the world if the rhythm goes off even by a second. Even my breathing feels like it doesn't belong outside my lungs, my breath sounds like a hurricane ready to destroy no matter how slow I tried to exhale. I ponder if I should hold my breath but I do not believe in my ability to hold it so I tried everything I can to keep the storm calm with normal slow breathing. Giving up on my eyes to comprehend this strange world, I make my way towards the city center with the help of my hands. Hands with limited reach compared to the gift eyes give us every day that are taken for granted, feeling nothing till my eyes become of use when they make out an odd shape. It was a large shape, standing tall over my stature with ease. Even though this giant shape has been bathed in this warm fake sunlight, it feels cold when my outstretched hands close in. Mere steps away from one of the many questions I pondered, I can now confidently say what this strange shape truly is that has been plaguing my mind since the moment I first placed my eyes of its blurry misshapen form from afar. 
What stands before me is a golden cross.

*Gasp!!!* I woke up and shot straight up in my bed, covered in sweat and panting like I was holding my breath. 
‚ÄúAnother nightmare?!‚Äù I sat in my bed, pondering what had been haunting me last night. I was shaking with my hands holding my head, unable to think of what scared me other than I was scared. I need to get up and get ready, but I don't want to. There's been days, most days where I don't want to go but reason won me over. Today fear is winning me to stay still and not leave, I look at my clock that now says 7:34. I could easily make it if I get out now, but I don't want to. A memory of Rachel warm welcoming smile popped into mind, washing away any fear and doubt I had. Finding a reason to go to work, I got out of bed slower than usual. My morning went by quicker and in a total blur, I headed to the bathroom, shower, brushed my teeth, dress, ate breakfast and got ready to leave. I check my clock again which now says 8:06, I can still make it just fine. I took a second to reach for the door knob, not wanting to leave the safe place I needed to keep away the nightmare. I grabbed the door knob, and walked out into the new day, or into hell.
Walking down the familiar street I known felt wrong, as if I were being watch from the shadow. I feel exposed, I want to turn back and hide under the sheets of my bed, I don't want to be outside. I feel like there's hundreds of eyes on me and I hate it. I quicken my pace away from what hell is out here when my city should be. I might be going crazy now, I thought I saw a glow behind the buildings. That doesn‚Äôt matter now, Random Shack is up ahead, I went into a dash as fast as I could to go to my second home where I could hide away from the terror of which I neither know nor wish to know. Just a few more steps, just within reach, I reached for the door and forced myself inside and shut the door behind me and held it shut so nothing could come after me.
 ‚ÄúOh? Good morning Ethan! Quit the entrance today. Are you that excited for work that you ran all the way here? Or do you think sprinting to work till get you that employee of the month?‚Äù Rachel said cheerfully after being surprised from my sudden entrance. I didn‚Äôt hear her greeting, more like I couldn‚Äôt. I stood there trying to catch my breath and with the pounding of my heart made it impossible to hear anything, and honestly I really didn‚Äôt want to hear. 
‚ÄúEthan?‚Äù Rachel asked but to no answer. Failing to calm myself, the fear that was outside continued as I forced the door behind me to stay closed even harder the more I thought about it. Beads of sweat now falling off my chin then to the floor where I stared, now fearing that something might crash through the doors where I stood now became a greater concern. Legs feeling like jello and needing to run again crept into my mind, now begging to run away was what my entire body was shouting at me to do. I closed my eyes tightly, seeking courage to let go of the closed door and make a run for it, getting a last few quick breaths in for my mad escape before suddenly‚Ä¶..
‚ÄúEthan!?‚Äù Rachel asked again while putting her hand on my shoulder. I open my eyes to see Rachel right in front of me. It was so warm and soothing for her to be so close to me, probably the only other time she was this close besides when we first met and I shook her hand. Staring right into her beautiful blue eyes washed away any fear I had brought with me into the store. After what anyone would agree to be way too long to be staring at anyone, I regained my consciousness which felt like I had lost since yesterday and finally answered the concerned women right in front of me.
‚Äú...Oh, s-sorry. Yeah. I‚Äôm fine, just. Had a bad morning, that‚Äôs all. I-I‚Äôm fine, really, sorry for worrying you.‚Äù I‚Äôve said the most amount of words to Rachel in one go the entire time I‚Äôve known her, and slowly let go of the door with aching hands relieved to do so.
‚ÄúAlright, if you say so. Must be a terrible start to your day, then. You‚Äôre pale as a ghost and sweating like crazy. Either you saw a ghost, or you realized you were going to be late and were about to ruin your perfect attendance.‚Äù Rachel said, trying to cheer me up, and it worked. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much she could do to make me feel worse than just a few moments ago.
‚ÄúEverything alright over there? I heard the door being slam shut, and it‚Äôs way too early for that to be an angry customer storming out just yet.‚Äù Rick asked and he made his way from the back towards us.
‚ÄúEthan saw a ghost, or maybe he found a bug in his coffee? The scared little guy hasn‚Äôt said much, but I can‚Äôt help but to worry about what had spooked him this badly. He didn‚Äôt seem like the type to be scared this bad.‚Äù said Rachel.
‚ÄúWell it is true that you didn‚Äôt show up like usual, but you never really showed up looking like you found $20 on the street. Tell you what, you can grab one of my snacks from my secret stash and you can have 5 extra minutes on your break!‚Äù Said Rick now trying to cheer me up. Not nearly as effective as Rachel, but I still appreciate it.
‚ÄúWell aren't you lucky! Well, besides the whole having a not so pleasant morning, but Rick always has the best snacks. Maybe I should show up like you did to get me some free snacks! Everyone knows that college kids run off of snacks, coffee, and the cheapest meal plans we can find.‚Äù Rachel said like her usual cheerful self. 
‚ÄúLet me know if you need anything. And take it easy, it‚Äôs best if you put what happened earlier behind you. Ok!?‚Äù Realising that not only that I haven‚Äôt moved from the same spot this entire conversation, but this is also the longest I had ever been in a conversation. Still be it her doing most of it, but progress. Both Rick and Rachel headed to where they are needed, leaving me alone at the door made the isolation feel worse than ever. That fear never left, making it hard to do anything. I don‚Äôt know how long or how I even did it, I made it behind the register. I felt better by being in a place I know quite well for a little bit, but being left alone with nothing but your thoughts and fears didn‚Äôt make being here any better. 
Opening the store and letting the early birds in as usual, but I couldn‚Äôt recognize anyone coming into the store. I couldn‚Äôt make out anyone, everyone‚Äôs face and body just looked like messed mashed blobs with no color to them. I tried to look for the two people I knew but they were nowhere to be found in the sea of colorless shaped and distorted voices. I didn‚Äôt know if I was working or doing anything, everything just went by so fast that I really couldn‚Äôt comprehend if anything happened or not. I stared out into the store with passing blurs going in and out, trying to grasp onto anything that I could understand but I always end up at the same isolated spot where I sat as everything at the store moves on without me. The buzz above me was loud, louder then ever. It sounds more like the screams of the damn, I might actually be in hell right now. I was going insane but I didn‚Äôt say a word. I don‚Äôt know if it was either because I didn't want disturbed what‚Äôs normal left of the store, or if I physically couldn‚Äôt. What felt like seconds to minutes passed, I felt like something within me was about to snap when-
‚ÄúAlright, break time!‚Äù Rick said, patting my back and snapping me out of a trance I was stuck in. I don‚Äôt know how hours passed but I wasn‚Äôt worried about that, I now have an excuse to leave this suffocating prison for a chance to breathe.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you where I keep some of my good snacks if you wa-‚Äù
‚ÄúNo thank you!‚Äù I said rushing past Rick, probably too harshly. But at the time I didn‚Äôt care, I needed to get out of here. 
‚ÄúO-Oh, ok. Guess he‚Äôs not a big snack guy?‚Äù
Again I sat in a spot where I should be fine, where I should be comfortable. My usual spot where I smoke away my  first half of the day and get ready for the next. Thinking of what I could be doing instead of this, but not now. I sat with my knees to head in a ball feeling like I‚Äôm being watched all over again. A looming fear crawling back inside where it shouldn‚Äôt belong. Now I sat hopeless not knowing what to do or why this was happening. I wanted to disappear, me or whatever was out there to go away. I tried to pray but I couldn‚Äôt get the words out, or think if I was even going to say it properly. I held myself tighter wishing for all of it to go away till I heard the door open beside me.
‚ÄúEthen?‚Äù It was Rachel, someone I hadn‚Äôt realized I wanted to see but was so grateful for her to be there right beside me.
‚ÄúIs everything ok? You looked out of it the whole day and rushed out the moment you could. Clearly something is wrong and you‚Äôre not telling.‚Äù Rachel said as she made her way right next to me and sat quite close to where I‚Äôm currently curled up. 
‚ÄúYou may not like it, but you have people who would gladly hear your worries and help in any way we can. Rick is holding down the fort for now, so we have time to get anything off your chest if it‚Äôs really bothering you this much!‚Äù She really is such a sweet person, and honestly I‚Äôve been waiting for this moment forever, one moment with just the two of us alone together. One chance to be alone with the prettiest, kindest, and most lovely individual I know. Open up to her and form a bond that will grow stronger with time. To have both sides to truly know and understand the other‚Äôs struggles and joys, one which I‚Äôve dreamed and fantasized for quite some time. It would be so easy to tell her, so simple to say ‚ÄúI had problems sleeping‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been having the strangest day‚Äù anything. I didn‚Äôt even need to tell her the full story, one bit and she‚Äôll understand and comfort me the best she could. More than what I needed, but what I craved deeply.
‚Äú......I‚Äôm sorry Rachel. I‚Äôve probably worried both you and Rick today. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶.something I‚Äôm dealing with. I don‚Äôt want to get either of you to get involved. Thank you for worrying about me so much, I really do appreciate it.‚Äù Those words came out so easily, the most I‚Äôve said without fumbling my words. The most normal sentence I‚Äôve been wanting to be able to say to her, but not the words I wanted her to hear.
‚Äú......Ok Ethen. But if you ever change your mind and want someone to talk to, you have two pairs of ears who will gladly listen.‚Äù Rachel said as she stood up. Before heading back inside she gave me one more reassuring smile. Not the smile I wanted, but it still warms me from the cold isolation that surrounds me.
I waited until Rachel's warm smile could no longer keep away the cold and fear before heading back inside. I walked past Rick who seemed a bit worn out from dealing with the store all on his own. When he saw me he quickly changed his tired look to that of worried concern. 
‚ÄúYou good, Ethen?‚Äù you now when someone like Rick means what they say when there‚Äôs no jokes or puns to what they are saying. He always cares but only in times like this does he show it in full force.
‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm good. Sorry.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even look him in the eyes. I really felt bad for putting him through all of my crap, but I was still thinking about how I failed my one chance with Rachel that I couldn‚Äôt even properly say sorry to my only friend. I continued my way to the register, glad to know that one of the eyes that are on me are ones that I know and are glad that they are there. I was still paranoid and scared, but the rest of the day went on like normal. I could see the faces of the afternoon customers and I could hear their rants and sly remarks like usual. Time went by faster than normal, which I don‚Äôt know if it was a blessing or a curse. Both Rachel and Rick came by to check on me, I lied to them again and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù, keeping then at arms length for hopefully someones own good. End of the day was here and the three quiet employees of Random Shack did their last tasks of the day before closing.
‚ÄúOk Rachel, you can head on back and get some rest for school.‚Äù It‚Äôs not often to see Rick to act like a gentle father, but he would be a great dad to have growing up with.
‚ÄúThanks Rick, but I‚Äôll stay around for a bit. Gotta make sure everything‚Äôs alright, I think it‚Äôs best for me to stay just a bit longer.‚Äù Even the kind Rachel never asked to stay past her work hours, I must be one hell of a mess for her to go out of her way twice for someone like me.
‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs what you want, then I‚Äôll allow it. Just make sure you don‚Äôt do anything crazy, it‚Äôs already putting my boxers in a bind to make sure one of our employees is alright.‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Rick, I‚Äôll be out of the way.‚Äù Having Rachel in the last few moments of closing the store was a blessing I didn‚Äôt know that I wanted. She stood by the door quietly watching over me and Rick doing the last of the tasks for the night, asking if I needed help even though he still has stuff he needs to bo. I really do appreciate what both of them are doing, I wish I can return the favor in any way I can. With Rachel watching me work I didn‚Äôt get the sense of needing to look impressive or needing to be perfect in what I was doing when Rachel was there watching me, I just felt calm and at peace with her there. Like the sun peeking out over the clouds from a cold day to warm me up, probably the only time I enjoyed doing work in my life. After finishing the last of our nightly tasks Rick said his lines like a tradition that must be upheld, but with less enthusiasm then normal,
‚ÄúAnd with that, the Shack is closed.‚Äù No one can blame him for not ending off with a high note, especially me who caused the whole awkward problem. But I was kinda hoping to hear Rick's usual self before parting ways for tonight.
 ‚ÄúEthen. You're probably sick and tired of hearing this all day, but are you sure you don‚Äôt want either of us to walk you home. Neither of us mind for tonight, we‚Äôre more than happy to help in any way we can.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true. I may not have anything fancy or a magic spell to cast away your problem, but I‚Äôll gladly do what I can if you need it.‚Äù While it is true I was getting tired of hearing the same worried concerns the whole day, I did want to stay with them just a bit longer. Away from the impending fear I can‚Äôt bare to face, the unknown that haunts me. I so desperately want the three of us to be here as long as I can, but today my mouth and body refuse to listen to me, almost like it doesn't understand what‚Äôs about to happen when I leave the only pillars I can lean on.
‚ÄúThanks you two. I really do appreciate you saying that. But I‚Äôll be fine, I don‚Äôt live too far from here. I‚Äôll be home in no time. You guys head home and get some rest. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be back to normal by tomorrow.‚Äù That last bit was a lie, I knew that was a lie yet I still said it. I said so many lies today I might as well name a new sin after me. I hate it, and I don‚Äôt understand why I did that. I don‚Äôt want to leave, I don‚Äôt want to go back home, and I know for damn sure that I wont be ok tomorrow, if I can make it to tomorrow. Both Rick and Rachel looked at each other then looked back at me knowing there‚Äôs no point in arguing and will let me be.
‚ÄúIf you say so. But if you change your mind, you know where I live, yeah?‚Äù
‚ÄúGoodnight Ethan, I hope a goodnight sleep will be what the doctor ordered.‚Äù I nodded my head then walked back home, I wished that of once they weren't such nice people and pressured me into saying what I been wanting to say this whole day. I didn‚Äôt look back, I wanted to but I didn‚Äôt. My body refuses to look back on the only people who care, slowly feeling their warm pressens fade away as I walked further away till it‚Äôs fully gone. Now standing in front of what should be my home, feels alien. I‚Äôve never stood in front of anything that felt so unwelcoming. I made my way inside, how? I would like to know, my body has been doing everything all on its own to the point where I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if someone else was controlling it. I did my nightly duties in a trance, like my mind was still processing how I managed to walked through the front door. It‚Äôs only until I stood in front of my bed where I was able to move my body the way I wanted to, only to be replaced by fear. I curled up back to a ball right next to my bed, not wanting to move or know what was about to happen. I subconsciously turned off the light like I was about to go to sleep, but that‚Äôs the last thing I wanted to do. Deep down I know that if I close my eyes, the worse will happen. That be it I never awake again or something else was anyone's guess. All I do know is that I should get up, turn on the light and wait out the night. But fear has a stronger hold than reason, holding me down in that one spot in the dark. Like it knows what will happen if I close my eyes and sleep one last time. I tried to make a last ditch effort and force myself with everything I had to get up and out of the bedroom, but failed miserably as I slipped and bumped on the side of my bed. Somehow my face brushing against the side of my bed was enough for me to succumb to fatigue and tiredness, my eyes grew too heavy to keep open as I fell asleep on my bedroom floor and faced whatever was in store for me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.",1,1750905047.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

(it's ugly, but it tastes 'oh so goooood')

I've been making sourdough for 2 1/2 years and am trying to expand with a good black rye that is NOT like a brick or dry and bland.  
PLUS, I'm wanting to bake more from whole grain that I freshly mill.

I would describe the taste of this bread like caramel and rye flavour. It is similar to the taste of pumpernickel but lighter texture and doesn't need to be sliced so thin. It is a soft chew rather than chewy.

Ingredients:

14 oz warm water  
6 oz almost peaked fed starter (my starter is white flour base)  
16 oz finely milled organic rye grain  
4 oz unbleached all purpose flour  
.7 oz salt  
\--------------  
Ingredients added in first stretch and fold  
1 tsp sugar  
2 Tbsp neutral oil  
1 Tbsp instant coffee powder  
2 1/2 Tbsp Apple cider vinegar  
2 Tbsp black molasses  


Method: (I am not an expert, so I imagine those of you more seasoned bakers would have different more effective methods).   
Mix first set of ingredients until flour is incorporated and dough is shaggy.  
Rest 30 min, then add second set of ingredients and knead dough for 5 minutes.  
Rest 30 min, then stretch and fold BUT This dough does not stretch and fold (low gluten). The texture is like rough cookie dough, so I pulled and folded the dough as best as I could. The dough is not sticky at all.  
Rest 30 min, S and F gentler  
Rest 30 min, S and F very gently - some bubble activity was beginning.  
Rest 30 min, then shape and put into baking loaf pan (it does behave like regular dough though. Fresh milled flours are very different, whether wheat or rye). Place oiled plastic wrap on it so it doesn't dry out.  
Rest on counter overnight. (about 12 hours)   
I scored this loaf and a lot of the gas leaked out and it deflated, so I don't recommend scoring it.  
Preheat oven at 450 F convection. Bake covered 30 minutes. Then uncovered for 20 minutes (BTW, I baked this loaf uncovered for 20 and the edges burned, so I would say 15 minutes is better depending on your oven) ALSO, I placed a piece of foil shiny side down to prevent the bottom from burning - again, this is how my oven works.

Hope this makes sense!

He always treats me well, puts me first, and is loving. Family loves him, friends love him, we share most of the same values‚Ä¶ except something that I care a lot about is money. He claims to care about money but it‚Äôs not presenting this way.  I have been a hard worker since the day I could have a job. Saving up, never making large purchases, never had credit card debt. I am currently working with a master‚Äôs degree, often overtime. I want to buy a house and pay off my car before I am 30. However, my bf is still in school. He had a tragic event happen which caused him to take a year off and delayed his graduation. I had asked if he works during the semester, he said he would like to but had to see what his courses were like. He never ended up finding a job‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs now summer, he is working at a local company that a family friend found a spot for him at‚Äî essentially sits at a desk and plays on his phone. If overtime is offered, he doesn‚Äôt accept it. He used to buy coffee every morning, but stopped after I explained a $3 coffee a day adds up, especially when you‚Äôre on a limited income. He had $1500 in CC debt when I met him. I was able to educate him on CC debt (he didn‚Äôt understand that there is interest every month even if you pay the minimum payment). But he paid it all off as fast as he could using the money he earned from his winter internship. Nearing the end of this spring semester he ran out of money again, like $-0 in his account so he had to use the credit card. I feel like it‚Äôs a vicious, never ending cycle. He has most definitely improved since we met and he explains that his parents didn‚Äôt  teach him about money and saving. I am happy to teach but I fear when he eventually graduates and is working that this will become a bigger issue and his lack of wanting to work will cause fights. He will be graduating with over $160k in student loans. I graduated with $90k, put my head down and SAVED SAVED SAVED and was able to pay it off within 2 years, his plan right now is to pay the minimum‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm just stressed..I love him and truly don‚Äôt want to end a relationship over this; but do you think our different ideas of money, debt, how to save, what to spend on, and wanting to work will forever be an issue?
