1i5g3yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlaskaAirlines/comments/1i5g3yv/this_is_weirdapp_getting_someone_elses/,This is weird...(app getting someone else's notifications),"I got this notification on January 10:

https://preview.redd.it/3j8k519582ee1.jpg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3052e6edcbad1d5097567e80f52f5a468220216a

But I wasn't going to Phoenix.  So I checked my account, wondering if someone had hacked me or something, and there was nothing in my account.  This message existed in my app, but there was nothing else about this flight (and there was no record locator with the message).  I checked the flight number, and it goes from PAE (Everett WA) to PHX.  I've never been to that airport.  I chatted support, and they said they couldn't find anything in my account regarding this flight, though it must be a be a glitch.  I asked if I could talk to tech support, they said they don't have tech support, but would submit my request to IT.  I thanked them and moved on.

But then, on the 16th, I got this:

And then, yesterday, I got these updates:

I uninstalled and reinstalled the app between the 12th and 16th.  It remains only in the app, and it doesn't matter if I log in or not - the app itself seems to be linked to this reservation.  I'm hoping it's just this reservation that's mixed up, and not someone else's whole account!

If you went from Everett to Phoenix on the 12th and back again yesterday... apparently your reservation is linked to my app!",1,1737340717.0,AlaskaAirlines,1,1.0,False

1i5fzn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i5fzn7/the_haunted_crib/,The Haunted Crib ,"*Go out at night and you will see*

*The face on the moon staring down at thee*

*If he smiles, sweet dreams come true*

*If he frowns, he'll come for you*

*- Old German folk song*



""That's such a creepy song,"" Ann said, shaking her head. ""Your parents would sing it to you every night?""

I shrugged. ""It wasn't the *only* song they sang to me as a kid,"" I said, feeling the need to defend my folks. ""But it was a family tradition going back generations. Like, ‘before my ancestors came to the US’ old.""

""I've never heard of it before.""

""Outside of my family, I really haven't either. I understand why.""

""Obviously.""

""But the last part never bothered me.""

""Never saw the face in the moon frown?""

""Never saw the face on the moon,"" I said.

""You aren't thinking of singing that to our kid, are you?"" Ann rubbed her very pregnant belly out of habit.

I didn't respond right away. She knew what I was thinking and started shaking her head no before the words leapt from my lips. ""I mean, it's tradition, after all.""

""No way,"" she said. ""I don't want to give our kid a complex.""

""It won't. I heard it all the time, and I'm okay."" Ann smirked, and I rolled my eyes, anticipating the joke. I cut it off at the pass. ""You married me. In fact, you couldn't wait to get in on these family traditions.""

She burst out laughing, and it made me smile. Her laugh, a huge blurt followed by nearly soundless cackles, made my heart sing. Even more so when I saw her swollen belly bob up and down with joy.

""Can I think about it, at least?"" she asked. ""I want to ask around to see if anyone else has ever heard this lullaby.""

I said sure. We changed the subject and went back to assembling the crib. Our son Mac was due in a few weeks, and we'd fallen behind in prepping his room. It wasn't totally our fault.

Needing to stretch our money, we bought a crib secondhand from someone who lived across the country. Ann found it during her late-night web crawling through Facebook groups. There were options locally, but they all looked like cheap deathtraps. I'm sure they were fine, but when Ann laid eyes on this one, it was love at first sight. She had to have it.

It was an antique but very well maintained. The seller said it had been a family heirloom they inherited when their parents died. Since the seller had no kids nor plans to have any, they put it up for sale. Oddly, they couldn't move the piece, and the price kept dropping. When it fell into Ann's target range, she sprung. Even with a higher shipping cost, it was cheaper than something new from Amazon.

The crib arrived in four boxes. The seller, who left no return address, had carefully pried apart the pieces and shipped them in separate containers. As expected, there were issues with the shipping, and we got the pieces at different times. The last box arrived yesterday, so we were reassembling it. Carefully.

""I can't believe they took this thing apart,"" I said. ""This is old-world craftsmanship.""

""I know,"" Ann said, beaming. ""It's stunning, isn't it?""

It really was. The old-world artisan had made the crib from mahogany wood, so it was as sturdy as can be. The color was a rich brown with the faintest highlights of red. But, the carvings on the head and footboards took this from a delightful piece of furniture to a room centerpiece.

In the center of the headboard was a carving of a smiling sun, their eyes cast down into the crib. The carved radiating rays went all the way to the edges of the board. Along the top, the artist carved what looked like cats, all following a crawling toddler.

The footboard was just as intricately designed. In the middle was the moon. Another face looking down at the crib with a Mona Lisa smile. The craftsman had carved the different phases in an arc, radiating from each side of the central moon. If you started from the left and followed along, the face would gradually appear as more of the moon came into view. A full, smiling face greeted you at its height before phasing back to nothing on the right.

Carved figures depicting medieval townspeople who lived and worked in a small town adorned the top. We made out most of them - butchers, bakers, blacksmiths, farmers - but a few were a mystery to us. Especially the man in the middle. It looked like a musician, but he was playing an instrument I'd never seen before. It kind of looked like a cow's horn, but I wasn't positive.

It was seeing this smiling moon face that had dislodged the lullaby from my memory.

""When Mac moves out of this, how much do you think we can sell this for?"" I asked, carefully assembling the legs to the base.

""We're not selling this,"" Ann said instantly. ""This is now our heirloom to pass down.""

""Until our kid sells it on their preferred social media marketplace sometime in the future. It'll probably be called HappyTime or Frndshp or something.""

""If we raise little Mac right, he'll hold on to it forever,"" she said, rubbing her belly again. ""I can already tell he's a good boy.""

We finished putting the crib together, and I moved it into place. We took a step back to admire it. Ann was right (as usual). This was a stunning piece of furniture. She leaned her head against my shoulder. ""We're actually doing this, huh? Becoming parents.""

""Crazy,"" I said, slinging my arm around her waist. ""I'm going to be someone's dad. Jesus.""

She laughed. ""You're going to be a great dad.""

""Only if I sing my family's traditional song to them.""

She laughed. ""Not a chance. Can I get you to rub my feet? They're killing me.""

A few hours later, we headed to bed. Bedtime had gotten earlier and earlier as the pregnancy advanced. I assumed it was the body's biological clock getting us ready for late-night feedings and butt changes.

Outside our window, I spied the full moon in all its glory. It was one of those freakishly large full moons that look amazing in person, but when you snap a picture, it just never captures the astonishing view. I called Ann over to take a peek.

She waddled over to the window and glanced up. ""Damn, the moon looks huge. Like, 'size of my belly' big.""

I reached out and rubbed her protruding stomach. ""I wouldn't go that far.""

""Oh my god,"" she said, pointing up. ""I…."" She started laughing at first, but soon tears began falling.

""What? Are you okay? Is something wrong with the baby?""

""I…I think I see a face on the moon.""

""What?""

She pointed up again. ""Off to the side. The darker spots look like a face. See it?""

""No.""

""It's…smiling.""

I rolled my eyes. ""Are you fucking with me?""

""No, I swear,"" she said. ""Do you honestly not see it?""

""I don't,"" I confessed. ""It just looks like the moon.""

""Hold on a second."" She grabbed her phone, zoomed in, and snapped a photo. She showed me and pointed at what she said was a smiling face. ""See it?""

""Kinda, but not really.""

""Wow. Do you see any face at all?""

I looked back up at the full moon. ""Nope,"" I said, scanning the surface for anything that might trick my mind and finding nothing.

""What do I get again if I see a smiling face? Sweet treats? I could use a snack.""

""Dreams. Sweet dreams,"" I corrected. ""Does this mean that we can sing the song to Mac now?""

""Not if there's a chance he'll see a frowning moon. The world is already fracturing. We don't need to add on some lunar curses for good measure,"" Ann said. ""You coming to bed?""

""Go ahead,"" I said, still staring up at the moon, ""I think I caught a second wind. I'm gonna stay up for a bit.""

""Don't be up too late. Remember, we have that appointment tomorrow.""

I kissed her forehead and sent her back to bed. Within minutes, Ann was asleep. She's like a robot in that way - she just powers down. The pregnancy has made it easier for her to slip away to the land of nod.

I was tired, but I was also curious. Ann seeing a face on the moon really hit me. I wasn't jealous (well, maybe a little), but I suddenly had a desire to look up the lullaby's origins. I hopped on my computer and started searching but came up empty. There wasn't a single thing out there about the song.

I glanced at the clock and saw it was just after ten. My dad, a notorious night owl, was probably still up. I decided to give him a call and see if he knew anything. He picked up on the second ring.

""Everything okay with my grandkid?""

""Yes, yes,"" I said. ""Mac and Ann are fine.""

""Thank God,"" he said, chuckling. ""I can't begin to tell you how nervous I am on your behalf. I'm so worried something bad is going to happen. Never had this when your mom was pregnant with you.""

""Maybe I wasn't as important to you as your first grandbaby,"" I joked.

He laughed. ""Yeah, that must be it. What's going on? Why the late-night call?""

""I have a random question for you. You remember the nursery rhyme you guys used to sing to me when I was a kid?""

""I sang a lot of songs.""

""The one about the moon smiling and frowning. The old German one?""

""Oh yeah,"" he said. ""That one was an odd. I hadn't thought about it for years, but it popped back into my head when you were born. It's probably because my folks sang it to me all the time as a kid. It was strange. Maybe that part of your brain gets activated when you finally have a little one?""

""What do you know about it?""

""Not much, admittedly. My parents sang it to me, and theirs sang it to them. It was some old family tradition. Kind of like Hank the Elf, ya know?""

Hank the Elf was Santa's magical helper, who would leave me chocolates in a sock I hung off my dresser every night in December. Sometimes, we'd exchange notes. Even after I knew Hank was my dad, I'd still write notes to Hank, and, like clockwork, he'd write back. I couldn't wait to do that with Mac.

""It's weird. I can't find anything about it online. Like, nothing. No lyrics. No history. No recorded melody. It just doesn't exist anywhere outside of our family.""

""That is odd. My parents always told me it was an old folk song, and I had no reason to doubt it. There's seriously nothing?""

""Look yourself,"" I said.

I heard him typing away on his computer. A few seconds later, he sighed. ""Well, ain't that something?""

""Did our ancient ancestors make up the song and never spread it around?""

""I dunno,"" he said. ""Maybe you can check in with a professor of mythology or music or Middle Age history? They might shed some light on it.""

""Maybe it was part of a ritual or something,"" I said, half jokingly. ""Maybe the elders were witches or something?""

He laughed. ""If they were, and I never got the ability to cast spells, I'm going to be so upset.""

We bullshitted a little before I told him about the new crib. I switched over to Facetime and went into Mac's room. I showed him the crib, and he was impressed. He adored the little carvings but worried they might be a choking hazard if Mac broke them off.

""I hadn't thought of that,"" I said.

""You will. As soon as the boy arrives, your 'dad brain' kicks in, and all you'll be able to think about is all the ways everyday items inside your house might spell death for your kids. It's exhausting.""

""We've already started babyproofing cabinets,"" I said. ""I hate the locks so much.""

He laughed. ""I thought you were going to do a dinosaur theme in his room. When did you switch to a storybook theme?""

""We didn't switch.""

""Then why get a bed with figures from the pied piper on it?""

""What?""

""The guy in the middle is playing a flute.""

""That doesn't make him the pied piper.""

""But then why is the other side a bunch of rats being led by a toddler?""

""Those are cats,"" I said.

""Son, you may want to look at them again.""

I walked over to the crib and inspected the carved animals closely. From afar, I swore they were cats, but up close, there was no denying I was wrong. They were rats. ""Son-of-a-bitch. You're right. They are rats.""

""The teeth weren't a giveaway?"" he asked.

""I hadn't even paid attention, to be honest. I doubt Ann did because when she mentioned it to me a few weeks ago, she said something about cats.""

""'Parent brain' comes for us all. Consider this the first of many times you'll be too tired or emotionally drained to think straight. Welcome to the club.""

We chatted a bit more before saying our goodbyes and hanging up. I'd been half-paying attention to what my dad was saying for a couple of reasons. For one, he was going long on an article he read once, years ago, that talked about the story of the actual pied piper. In my dad's typical storytelling fashion, he included every fact or half-remembered fact that ended up muddying the narrative. Apparently, a bunch of kids in 1200s Germany died or went missing or something. Some people said the piper was a metaphor for death, some said he was real, and others said he was a witch. I dunno. Dad was all over the place.

For two, I couldn't shake the image of the pied piper being carved into a crib. Why in the world would anyone ever make a bed with that as the theme? The guy ends up drowning all those kids. Who would want a nightly reminder of that?

A thought streaked across my brain. What would Ann think when I told her about this in the morning? How crushed would she be? She loved this crib.

I turned to leave the room when I heard a car turn down our street, blasting a bass-heavy song. It was so loud it rattled our indoor fixtures. I opened up the blinds, flooding the room with moonlight, and glared out. I spied a lifted truck with blue running lights slowly driving down our street. They seemed determined to wake up the whole goddamn neighborhood.

Then I chuckled to myself. ""Jesus, I'm becoming an old man already. This kid has aged me.""

I went to pull the blinds back down when I glanced up at the full moon. That's when I saw it. My jaw went slack, and I could hear blood whooshing in my ears. Tears welled up and burst, rolling down my frozen face. I hadn't wanted to believe Ann earlier because it sounded so impossible. And yet, here it was, looking down at me.

A face on the moon…and he was frowning.

""Oh fu…"" I said before I heard something snap behind me. I turned and looked but saw nothing out of place. At first. In the yellow moonlight, I saw what had snapped. A single figure had been ripped from the crib. The pied piper.

I flipped on the light but couldn't see where the figure had fallen. I didn't know how it had snapped off. The figure must have cracked during shipping and finally broken off the railing. That seemed farfetched, though. I'd seen the piper figure firmly attached earlier. But what else could it be? Nothing running through my brain made sense. It was just me in here, and it's not like it broke itself off the crib. It was just a piece of wood.

I ran over to the crib and flung off the mattress. The figure had disappeared. I was about to move the crib aside to check behind the dresser next to it when I froze. The moon's smiling face on the footboard had changed to a frown. The sun on the headboard was gone altogether.

I let go of the railing like it was electrified and stumbled back. In the corner of my mind, I heard the faintest notes from a flute play. My eyes caught the shadow of a man dart behind me. That was my cue to get the hell out.

I bolted out, slamming the door behind me. I turned to make sure nothing had followed me out of the room. There was nothing. I waited a second or two just to make sure.

""What are you doing?"" It was Ann. The shock of hearing her voice made me scream. ""You feeling okay?""

""I...I saw a face. On, on the moon.""

She looked crushed. She walked over to me and stroked my arm. ""You saw a frown, didn't you?""

""I, I did.""

""Well, you know what that means, right?"" she asked, staring deeply into my eyes. ""It means you're going to die.""

That shocked me. ""Wh-why would you say that?""

""Because I'm going to be the one who kills you.""

I yanked my arm away from her touch. I tried to respond, but my voice died in my throat. My wife - my beautiful, lovely, sweet wife - had just threatened to kill me in her normal honeyed voice. It was as matter-of-fact as if she asked me to switch the laundry over. We locked eyes, and she smiled wide. Too wide.

The skin at the corners of her mouth cracked and slowly but violently pulled apart. The skin tore in strips, and blood spurted from the wounds. She didn't react at all. Instead, she crammed her hands into the sides of her mouth. She squeezed down on the shredded flaps, her fingers as tight as a vise, and yanked her arms away from her body.

Her face tore and ripped away from her skull. Each hand held a jagged edge of bloody flesh. It wobbled in her grip, the nerves firing off their last bit of stored energy. The muscles under her skin twitched and pulsated. Blood oozed from them.

She dropped the skin, and it plopped to the ground with a wet slap. Her hands went back to her face. Putting both hands back in her mouth, she started pulling up. Hard. She let out a strained grunt that gave way to the bones in her face and skull cracking. Some shards burst through the muscle as the top of her head lifted off her body. With a final bit of effort, she pulled the top of her head clean off.

Underneath was the featureless face of the pied piper figure.

Without thinking, I threw a punch. It landed with a crunch, but it wasn't the wood that crumbled. It was my poor fist. The pied piper raised my wife's hand and shamed me, shaking her finger back and forth. The piper reached into the gap at her neck and yanked hard, splitting her body in two.

The halves of my wife's body fell like a butcher had sliced them. Standing in front of me now was the now human-sized wooden pied piper. It had freed itself from the crib and come looking for me. Now that it had me, it raised the horn to its face. Music started playing inside my head.

For a fleeting second, I felt my body calm. My mind, which had been racing like a lost Andretti relative, instantly soothed. The edges of my vision softened, and from the piles of gore in front of me, I saw dozens of plants rising. My house gave way to a verdant meadow with soft, rolling hills in the distance. The sky above was so blue I had to shield my eyes from the color. Fluffy, balloon-like clouds scudded across.

The firework explosion of blooming flowers drew my eyes away from the sky. They were the most exquisite colors I'd ever seen. Unnaturally vibrant. Not long after, fat black and yellow bumble bees zig-zagged in a blossom to drink up the alluring nectar.

It felt like I had stepped into a painting - everything was so real, but it had a sheen of artificiality. As much as the music rendered this serene image in front of me and urged me to let go, a dark corner of my brain was screaming for me to wake up from the illusion. My monkey brain knew something was wrong.

""What's all the racket?"" It was Ann. The real Ann. She emerged from our bedroom, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. The return of her voice - her real voice - helped light up the darkened part of my brain. The art project melted away, and the gore returned. I saw Ann's horrified face and heard my scared subconscious screaming again.

""Run!"" I yelled.

I pushed past the pied piper, grabbed Ann's hand, and yanked her along toward the front door. She stumbled, and only through an act of god and many intense arm workouts did I keep her upright. If we fell, I knew we'd be goners. I grabbed my keys, whipped open the door, and we took off for the car.

""Get in! GET IN!"" I yelled, fumbling with the keys to the car.

""What's happening?""

""I saw a face on the moon. It was frowning.""

She didn't say a word. She didn't have to - her facial reaction said everything. We both slid into the car. I fired up the engine and glanced over my shoulder to make sure I wasn't about to take out some poor sap walking his dog late at night. When I turned it back to the house, I saw the pied piper standing in the doorway.

He wasn't alone.

All of those wooden rats had ripped themselves off the crib and had come to life. Only, they weren't the size of regular rats. Not even the size of burly New York subway rats. These things were as big as Rottweilers. Like the piper, they had no features…save for razor-sharp teeth.

""What the hell are those?""

""Rats.""

""From where?""

""The crib,"" I said.

""Our crib?""

""After tonight, it's the dump's crib. Buckle up!""

The piper played music, but I couldn't hear it this time. But the rats could. They turned their attention toward my car. The lead rat hunched down and launched themselves onto my hood. It misjudged the slickness of my car and fell off, but by that time, the second rat was airborne.

I jammed the car into gear and slammed on the gas pedal. My car rocketed backward into the street. The rats kept coming. A third and a fourth leapt through the air and landed on my trunk. They started biting the metal, and, much to my amazement, the metal started crunching.

""What do we do? Can we stop this?""

An idea popped into my brain. I threw my phone at Ann. ""Call my dad. I have to ask him about the song.""

She dialed his number. I heard a pop from my back driver's side tire as she did. The air came screaming out. It sounded like someone in distress. The passenger side rear went too, and the back of my car dropped.

I shifted into drive and pressed on the gas. My car lurched forward, but something caught in the tires and kept us from escaping. A rat had wedged itself in the wheel well. We couldn't move forward. I switched to reverse, to rock out of it, but it was to no avail. We were stuck.

""Hello?"" It was my dad's sleepy voice. ""Is something…""

""Are there more words to the lullaby?"" I screamed.

""What?""

More metal crushing from the back and now the rear doors. The rats were eating through the goddamn car. My heart dropped when I saw the empty car seat in the back. A horrid thought flashed in my brain - would I even get a chance to meet Mac?

The piper kept playing. The rats kept eating. I kept panicking, but I held it long enough to ask, ""Dad, what are the other words to the song?""

""Uh, I used to only sing the, hold on. Gail, Gail, what were the words to that horrid German song we used to sing?""

I could hear my mom waking from her sleep. Simultaneously, another rat jumped on the hood of the car. It hissed and started gnashing at the windshield. Ann screamed. That got my mom moving.

""What's wrong?"" my mom asked, her voice panicking.

""I'll fill you in later. What about the song?""

""Umm, Go out at night and….""

""No, after that. After the moon frowning.""

""Umm, let me think.""

The windshield spider-webbed as the rat broke a small hole in the glass. ""Mom! Hurry!""

""Umm, If the moon brings forth your doom, umm, pray for the sun to return soon…or something like that.""

""I pray to whoever the fuck is listening - God, Buddha, the Sun - to return and burn these fucking things to ash!""

""Please,"" Ann added.

CRASH! The rat on the hood of the car had broken the entire windshield out. I reached over and grabbed Ann's hand. I gave it a squeeze. ""Baby, I'm so sorry. I love you more than you'll ever know,"" I said, tears flooding my eyes.

""I love you, too. Mac and I both,"" she blubbered. We closed our eyes and waited for the end. I knew the next thing I'd feel would be the gnawing of wooden teeth against my bones.

But that didn't happen.

Instead, I felt an intense warming sensation spread across my body. Through closed eyelids, the darkness purpled until it was bright red. I opened my eyes, and an intense yellow light immediately stung me. It was coming from the middle of our yard.

I shielded my eyes with my hands but tried to sneak a peek between my fingers. But the light was too intense to get a look. I heard sizzling and screaming as the rat on the hood ignited and melted into a puddle of black goo. It slid off the car, leaving a trail of sludge and a mark on the cement.

All the rats were melting.

I put the car in park, pushed open the door, and, against Ann's screaming, stepped into the street. The light had dimmed from its peak but hadn't gone out totally. But the intensity was such that I could see it clearly now. A ball of pure, pulsating yellow light hovering in my front yard.

""What the hell?""

I assumed dozens of neighbors would come rushing out of their homes to see what the commotion was, but nothing stirred. The light had done the impossible - cause a ruckus in the suburbs without attracting a Karen. The only thing the light bothered was the rats. The rats and one other thing.

The piper.

The figure was standing near the glowing ball, staring at it. It no longer had any interest in me. It raised the horn to play again, but a blast of white light from the ball ignited the piper's hand. The figure turned to run, but it was already too late. The ball of light flashed again. It was so bright it briefly lit up the entire neighborhood. The heat was so intense and focused that, in mere seconds, it reduced the pied piper to a pile of ash.

Literally, in a flash, the piper was gone.

The ball of light rotated toward me. We stared at each other for a beat. I didn't know what to do, so I nodded at it. A non-verbal thank you from a flesh and blood human. It quickly flashed three times before winking out. As it did, something heavy thudded on the grass. I was standing in the dark again.

""Is it gone?"" Ann asked, climbing out of the car.

""I...I think.""

""Jesus,"" she said, laughing. ""Our car is fucked.""

I made my way over to where I'd heard the object fall. As I got to where the glowing ball had been, I saw a perfect circle burned into my lawn. Inside that circle was the carved depiction of the smiling sun from the crib's headboard.

""Holy shit,"" I said, picking it off the ground. It was slightly warm to the touch but didn't burn my hands. In fact, I found the warmth comforting. Like a hug.

Ann joined me. She delicately ran her fingertips over the carving. ""We have to keep this. It saved us.""

""Yeah,"" I said, reaching out and touching her belly. ""It saved all of us.""

With perfect comic timing, Ann said, ""The rest of the crib has to go, though."" We laughed like idiots for ten minutes.

Afterward, I managed to guide my busted ass car back into the driveway. As Ann had declared, it was truly fucked. How the hell would I explain this to Geico?

I called my parents back and told them what had happened. They didn't doubt me. They were at the house fifteen minutes later and stayed the rest of the night. Dad even helped me drag the crib to the curb.

""Who did you order this crib from?"" I asked.

""Someone on the marketplace.""

""Show me.""

Ann brought up her phone messages and searched. She scrolled…and scrolled…and scrolled. She stopped, confused. ""The messages are gone.""

""Maybe the ad is still up in the store?"" I asked, knowing the answer already.

It wasn't. Just another layer of ""What the hell?"" to an already well-layered ""Fuck this"" cake. Ann told me everything she could remember about the account she messaged with but had limited information because who would bother to remember anything like that? She was hunting for a decent sale, not making a best friend. Turns out, she found neither.

Everyone else has fallen asleep. I'm sitting in my office, staring at the carved sun and writing this out. I'm hoping someone out there might shed some light on this for me. Has anyone heard this song? Does anyone know anything about the crib? Or how the moon and sun figure into it? Where was the land the piper was showing me? Shit, why was the pied piper part of it?

How screwed up were my ancient relatives?

Best as I can tell, and granted, this is all speculation on my part, is that the song may have activated the crib. In turn, that awakened the face on the moon, which activated the piper. I don't know what the energy ball was. I have no clue how the person selling this thing tracked Ann down. I don't see how any of this, well, magic works. All I know is that this entire ordeal felt predetermined.

I can't shake that feeling. That forces beyond my understanding and unconstrained by time and space aligned in just a way to kill me off. The uneasy feeling that this was supposed to happen to me. Like my bloodline was supposed to end tonight. What about my linage pissed off the moon? What horrid curse is in my blood…and am I passing it down to Mac?

We stopped the piper for now, but I'm worried he might return. I plan to hang the carved sun in Mac's room for protection - probably over his regular-ass Amazon Basic's crib. The boy will be the centerpiece of the room…not his creepy German bed.

It's silent in the house now. There's no piper music in my head, but I keep expecting to hear it again. He showed me some strange land, which must've been important to me or my family. Right? He was trying to lure me somewhere…but where? And why?

I'm going to put on a pot of coffee. I'm not sleeping tonight. Not until the sun rises, anyway. I'll take all the protection I can get.",2,1737340331.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

It was cold when I woke up. Smoke. Packing gear. Out of the tent. My friend isn't up. 'That's odd. That Vodka'll get ya.' I could've sworn I heard him over at the next camp earlier. ""Hey man, you up?"" Groggily, ""Yeah."" ""I'm tearing my gear down. I'll be ready in about 20."" Him slowly, ""Cool, I got your coffee this morning. Are you taking your tent?"" "" Yeah, I'm taking everything."" Him slowly, ""You know you can leave it here right?"" ""Yeah. I'm taking everything with me."" Still slowly, ""But you should just leave it here. It'll be fine."" 'This guy woke up, started drinking again, and passed out already. Great.' Me slightly annoyed, ""Look. I'm taking everything with me."" ""But what if we wind up back here? You won't have to set it up again."" 'Goddamnit.' ""I'm taking everything with me. If we wind up back here I'll set it back up. I typically do that every night on the road. It's no big deal."" ""Ok. Let me know when you're ready."" ""Will do."" Gear packed. ""Hey man, I'm ready."" ""Ok. Give me a minute."" ""You got it."" Smoke. Reddit. 

I get a message. ""I'm traveling near where you are on my way from Florida to California(?) for work. I'd like to meet you, if you're cool with it. I can probably take you out to dinner."" ""Yeah. I'm good with that. I got some things I gotta do today. I'm checking in to a hotel room a church is getting us later. I won't do anything to jeopardize that, just in case they require us to stay there. But yeah I'm good with meeting up.""

My friend gets his act together. Gear on. We head down the trail. Stop in next camp and talk to a couple dudes living out there too. And we're off. Down trail. Dodging lake sized puddles. Decide we're making things more difficult than they need to be. Back to trail. Pretty easy trip out of the woods.

My friend is being a little difficult. He seems to not be hearing what I'm saying. His ideas this morning are shit, and unfounded. He thinks the church is not gonna get us hotel rooms. No reason. He's just negative. We hit Family Dollar for smokes to prep for being in the hotel. Him, ""I got your pack of smokes man."" ""I'm good."" ""I'm doing it! I'm a giver."" I know sometimes I'll argue with somebody that wants to pay me back for helping them. I've learned to let them. ""Fair enough. I won't argue with you this morning."" 😆

I go around the building to get out of the biting wind. Drop gear. He sets his daypack down. ""I'll be right back."" 'No shit.' He goes inside. Back out five minutes later. ""Dude! I don't have my wallet on me."" He searches his pack. ""It's gotta be in my tent."" ""Go check. I'll be here when you get back."" More reddit. He calls about fifteen later, ""I'm on my way. Coming through the fields now. I'm hustling."" ""Cool."" No need for the call, but I know he means well. This just isn't the same guy I've been hanging out with for the last couple weeks. He comes around the corner, hands me a pack of smokes and a new lighter. Me, ""I've got a backup lighter in my pack. I don't need this."" He promised to buy a lighter for someone back at camp. He's just bought two lighters. He needs one. I can do the math. ""Here. Take it."" ""Ok, thanks."" We head for Hardee's.

""We don't have coffe. We quit making it after breakfast."" 'Fuck this place.' ""Let's go to McDonald's. They'll have coffee"" ""I hate McDonald's. Me, ""Well I'm after caffeine, and at this point I don't give a fuck about their business practices."" We go. Coffee. He buys us each a cheeseburger. 'Nice!'

I tell him a story about the time I got pulled off the streets and wound up playing with Eric Clapton. He's loving the story but every time I mention bass players he's talking shit about them. And none of it is legit. There was a lot of my time as a musician where I would tell anyone the reason I loved playing guitar as well as I did was because I got to play with good bass players and drummers.

I set him straight on bass players in no uncertain terms. He accepts it. We bail to the library. He hits a computer. I go to my chair. All the way there his attitude is shit. His ideas about what we should do are shit, and make no sense. Charging my stuff. Announcement over the library PA about rides to hotel rooms. I pack my stuff. Him, ""Wait here. I gotta go talk to someone."" It's minutes until we're gonna miss our ride. ""I'm going outside."" He ignores me and bails. I shoot  him a text, ""I told you I was going outside. Come get your stuff. I'm not standing here while you dick around."" Downstairs and out the door I go. I'm done with his bullshit at this point. 

Find a seat outside. He comes up a few minutes later. He's being a dick to other homeless asking for details on the hotel rooms. I cut him off. Explain details nicely. 

I lay into him about being a dick, not listening to me all morning, etc. He apologizes. Still talking about stupid ideas we should do that make no sense at all. Apologizes again. 

Stupid ideas all the way to the hotel. I start cutting him off and telling him whatever he's talking about is a non-issue. 

We knew they were gonna pack us in four deep in a room. We get another two guys together that are sensible. Hit hotel. Get through check in with church people, off to room. My friend is still non sensical. I keep cutting him off. Then I ignore him all together.  He gets the hint. I go outside for a smoke.

Reddit. Message from dude coming throug, ""I'm still about two hundred miles out. Let me know when you get settled in. Tell me where you're at."" Message back, ""Just got in. I'll get back to you shortly."" Back inside. Look up address. Text dude that and my number, ""Text me when you get here.""

I took the nicest shower in so long I can't remember. The room is nice. As a guy who has built hotels I'd say this one was remodeled in the last year. Everything is new. No bugs. No tweakers. No bullshit. 'Not bad.' Nice beds. 

I get an email. Nice redditor I helped out a couple days ago has come into some money, sends me back what I sent her plus some. 'Holy shit! That's awesome! This girl's legit!' We're on text messaging terms now. We chat a bit. Much thanks from me.

I mention it to my friend.  He says something kinda shitty. I school him. I have no intention of hitting him, but he had best change his ways and apologize. This is a friend of mine who has proven to me she's one of the good ones in the world. I don't consider a lot of people a true friend. You fuck with one of my friends I'll drop everything immediately, travel across the country and beat your ass. I've done it before.

I realize he's drunk, been in a shit mood all day, and this isn't his normal behavior. He gets a serious talking to. I am NOT fucking around. At all. He apologgizes profusely. I didn't yell or raise my voice. But I think he new he was poking an angry dog that was not caged. Fair enough. We're cool.

Sitting a chair. Charging. Reddit. Screwing around on the internet. Look over. Friend is passed out. Talking in his sleep. Still passed out. Not talking in his sleep.

Get a text from dude. He's outside. ""I'm on my way. I gotta be back by 8:30 or I'll be outside with no gear."" Downstairs. Outside.

I mistake him for a homeless guy staying at the hotel. (Sorry man! 😆) Say something about, ""These rooms are nice huh?"" ""Thanks for meeting with me. I wanted meet you face to face for five minutes..."" We talk. Tells me about his son dying on the streets. Says he's got a place in Central Florida. I'm welcome to stay there. Has some work for me. I give him brief rundown about leaving the boat because I ran out of money, I'm out looking for work. We smoke and chat. He offers me a smoke. ""I'm good. Got plenty."" We have some similarities in background. Offer stands to come by, hang out and do some work. Him, ""I know you're pressed for time. I offered to buy you dinner. Here take this."" Hands me some cash. ""Thanks man. I appreciate it."" ""Call me when you head back to Florida."" ""Will do.""

This week I'm quitting. I will do a one week wean (7days). 
I was caffeine free until 20 years old.
Then I began having black tea with cream and sugar at the end of a meal to stop me from bringing because I suffered from a bringing disorder then, and it helped give me a lid to the pod sort of speak. 
I got influenced from people around me to start coffee/ lattes, now two kids later and 32, I'm hooked. I'm scared when I quit il become fat again (not that I was but definitely borderline) because my eating will get out of control again. I guess I'm scared of alot of things. I bringed because it would help my anxiety go down. Now I'm scared about all the feelings quitting will bring.
I guess I'm just not looking forward to the withdrawals.

We somehow end up really close and he tells me in a random night that he has feelings for me but for external and internal factors he knew nothing would happened. We move on still as friends because we are both in our own shit. Like two month passes and we hang out like a celebration (just the two of us), he ends up admitting that I make him happy and that he cares about me and somehow we ended up kissing. Then we go back to him telling me that he doesn’t want to led me on but he’s moving away and the idea of us being in a relationship is not something tangible bc of valid reasons but that if we could maintain the friendship as best as we can.

He first hugged me (which he never does), we catch up and I can tell he’s not able to stop looking at my lips, he kinda shits on a guy that tried to hit on me, asks me more about my personal life, is talking very low which made me had to get closer to him multiple times, his feet were always pointing at me in a way, if he wasn’t fidgeting around with his hands then it was his legs (he normally doesn’t do this), he’s okay with me getting closer, he smiles a lot and looks at me while laughing, but every time when we were quiet then he couldn’t look at me. When we are leaving he kinda follows me to my car, he hugged me once again I touched his stomach he’s okay with me doing that, says he’s glad that he saw me. Then for a reason we share chapstick and then he just stared me in quietness but I just got into my car and left. What do yall think? Was he just nervous that we got to see each other again?

Wait until the last acceptable moment to cancel plans you’re not excited about, because the other party might cancel before you. 

Talking about former colleagues, etc…people you don’t see on the regular. More often than not you’ll both be contemplating the meet up and if you wait a little longer than feels comfortable, you can be the reliable one instead of the unreliable one.

The crypto world is buzzing louder than a crowded LA club, and for good reason. President-elect Donald Trump is about to take the stage, and with him, the markets are already throwing a wild pre-party. With January 20th right around the corner, traders are eyeing some serious gains, dubbing this anticipated market wave the ""Trump Pump."" Love him or hate him, his entry is shaking things up, making memecoins and crypto darlings like $SOL and $XRP the talk of the town.  

💥 $SOL, a.k.a the smooth operator of blockchains, is crushing resistance like it’s breaking hearts. Trading at $270 and heating up fast—this baby is aiming for the stars (and maybe $350). Traders are already lighting Twitter on fire with SOL memes and predictions.  

🔥 Meanwhile, $XRP isn’t just riding a wave; it's making its own tide. Ripple’s legal drama might get that fairytale ending traders have been waiting for. Hovering at $3.2 with eyes on the $4 prize, this bad boy has all the makings of a breakout star.  

But wait—hold your champagne because there’s a wildcard in the mix: the Trump memecoin. It’s bold, brash, and already flexing a whopping $38 billion FDV. If you’re following the vibes, this could be the cherry on top for risk-takers.  

Get your coffee and your charts because January 20th might just be the hottest day in crypto so far. Are you ready for this ride—or do you need a hug and a $YOI token after?

I will receive a total of 100+ minis as part of the Nemesis and STALKER board game orders, which I plan to paint with my younger brother. I want to avoid the mistakes I made 15 years ago with WH40k minis (e.g., overly dark paint jobs on my Daemonhunter minis). My goal is to have fun, achieve good results efficiently, and make the most of limited painting time (half a day per week).

# Goals

My goal isn’t to become a pro but to enjoy the hobby with my brother while achieving visually satisfying results. Efficiency and simplicity are key, as I can only dedicate half a day per week to painting.

# Research on Efficient Techniques

There are many techniques for painting minis, each with its own proponents. For me, efficiency is key—I want good shading, lighting, and color without requiring advanced skills or excessive time.

**Contrast Paints & Speedpaints 2.0**

* **Pros**
   * Automatically sink into recesses for shading
   * Deliver good color quality and time efficiency
* **Cons**
   * Hard to predict final colors (dark before drying, vague bottle labeling)
   * Mistakes are punishing; fixing requires re-priming
   * Limited control over shading flow

# Slap Chop Technique

I like its ability to create grimdark contrasts. But slap chop with speedpaints tends to result in overly dark and desaturated minis, even when professionals use it ([examples](https://youtu.be/gT2JV3Ks41g?t=836), [examples](https://youtu.be/r6QYfLulklQ?t=282), [examples](https://youtu.be/sfdFC7K8UIk?t=505)). While some suggest using grey primer ([Dana Howl example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DZznl9ZbcE)) there and here ([Goobertown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT2JV3Ks41g)) we see that this can still lead to undesirably dark results, especially on the faces.

# Preferred Approach: Pale/Wash Chop

This method balances contrast and vibrant colors:

* C[omparison video](https://youtu.be/HeXPawTuxXs?t=132) showing white prime + wash vs slap chop (no dry brush afterwards)
* [Howl’s example](https://youtu.be/fLDStOW7DMM?t=476) includes dry brushing
* Lyla Mev does it too and calls it ""wash cop"" and uses colored washes ot just a dark one: [video](https://youtu.be/r6QYfLulklQ?t=373)

While the dark areas are not as pronounced as slap chop, this method avoids dulling the colors and works efficiently. 

# Technique Conclusion

After this research, my preferred technique is the ""wash chop"", which combines efficiency with good contrast and vibrant colors. The steps are:

1. **Prime in white:** Use a rattle can, create a smooth, even base coat
2. **Apply a dark wash:** Use Nuln Oil or AP Dark Tone on all textured parts of the model, both do the job very similaryl well
3. **Drybrush with white acrylic:** Use a high-pigment artist-grade white paint, like Schmincke Primacryl Titanium White. As bonus: Applying more from above to downwards creates a zenithal lighting effect
4. **Apply Speedpaints:** Use Speedpaints 2.0 for time-efficient color application

This approach strikes a great balance for me: it retains enough white areas to maximize the vibrancy of speedpaints/contrast paints, while also providing adequate shading and depth. It avoids the overly dark, desaturated look of slap chop while maintaining a similar level of contrast.

# Drybrushing

I’ve never tried drybrushing before, and opinions on details of how to do it the best way vary widely. Here’s what I’ve gathered so far:

1. **Preparing the Brush**
   * Some sources suggest slightly dampening the brush for smoother results; this advice seems widely agreed upon
   * To remove excess paint, the most common method is dabbing on a paper towel. However, this can lead to a chalky texture. Alternatives include:
      * A **texture palette** (e.g., [Dana Howl's custom version](https://youtu.be/ILjqs2VoUXo?t=631))
      * A **self-healing cutting mat**, though it’s harder to measure how much paint remains
   * Brushes: Options include drybrushing-specific tools, makeup brushes, or others, depending on the desired effect.
2. **Choosing Paint**
   * High-pigment, professional-grade white acrylics (e.g., Schmincke Primacryl Titanium White) are recommended for their stronger whiteness compared to standard miniature paints
3. **Practical Benefits**
   * Drybrushing helps smooth out any pooling or ""coffee staining"" from dark washes

For a comprehensive overview, I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtD1kyz5slk) especially helpful, covering most of the techniques and tips I’ve taken note of.  


# Speedpaints

I plan to invest in the 50 Speedpaints 2.0 set for a wide range of colors. Here’s what I’ve learned about using them effectively:

1. **Challenges and Solutions**
   * **Unpredictable Colors:** The paint appears very dark before drying, and bottle labels are vague ([example video](https://youtu.be/kTIRVX74u0g?t=580)). To address this:
      * Refer to Stahly's swatch comparison: [Tale of Painters swatches](https://taleofpainters.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ToP_The_Army_Painter_Speedpaint_hand-painted_swatch_V2.0.jpg.webp)
      * Ideally, create your own swatch for real-life reference, although I haven’t decided how to approach this yet
   * **Fixing Mistakes:** Errors with Speedpaints are punishing; fixing requires covering mistakes with white acrylic and repainting. To minimize visible errors, start with darker colors and layer brighter ones last ([tip source](https://www.reddit.com/r/minipainting/comments/187dsnw/comment/kbdsp43/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))
2. **Additional Tips**
   * This guide on contrast paint techniques offers a lot of helpful advice: [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/11l28rx/comment/jba23s9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

# Speedpaint Metallics

Speedpaint metallics behave differently from standard Speedpaints. They have higher opacity, which reduces the visibility of underlying shading. This characteristic can be seen in [this detailed comparison video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAhPlY_YIlU).

# General Consensus

* Many YouTubers and Reddit users stated that that they were unhappy with the Speedpaint metallics ([example 1](https://youtu.be/kTIRVX74u0g?t=747), [example 2](https://youtu.be/UrlbZddNO0Q?t=634))
* Reportedly they perform better when applied over a silver or metallic base coat

**Testing and Recommendations**

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A6Uq78huwE) provides one of the most comprehensive tests of Speedpaint metallics over different undercoats. Here Vince Venturella demonstrated to me that Speedpaint metallics can likely work well in a wash chop setup, since it is not too different form the zenithal black-to-white undercoat he recommends.

In conclusion, while Speedpaint metallics may not be the best option for intricate metallics, they can be useful in specific setups, particularly with proper base preparation.

# Next Steps

I’ve outlined my plans and research and am eager to hear your feedback. Specifically: 

* Have I missed any key techniques, tools, or considerations that could help me achieve my goals? 
* Are there any pitfalls in my chosen approach (wash chop + Speedpaints) that I should watch out for?

Please keep in mind that I’m a beginner with no finished minis to show yet. My knowledge comes from collecting insights from various sources and making observations, but I’m still figuring things out.  
  
I’m constantly refining my approach based on feedback, yours included.  I plan to share pictures of my progress and results in a few weeks. Thank you in advance for your advice and constructive criticism!

So here are some examples of that happening to me or my coworkers. (LONG POST LONG POST LONG POST!!!!!!)



Example 1: *literally already steamed the milk and is adding it to the latte*

Customer : “that was made with nonfat milk right?” 

Me: “no it wasn’t made with nonfat because the sticker doesn’t say nonfat but I can remake make that for you”

What I really wanted to say: “obviously it wasn’t made with nonfat because it wasn’t ordered with non fat DUHHHH! IF YOU WANT NON FAT ORDER NON FAT !”



Example 2: *guy orders a grande pike with no cream and 2 sugars*

Customer: *receives coffee* “thanks and this has the stevia sugar right?”

Me: “umm sorry no you didn’t specify stevia sugar so we just used normal sugar” 

Customer:” OH NOPE I CANT HAVE NORMAL SUGAR I NEED STEVIA”


ME: “no problem I can get you another coffee with stevia” 

What I wanted to say: “ IF YOU NEED A SPECIFIC SUGAR THEN REQUEST THE SPECIFIC SUGAR DONT JUST ASSUME WE KNOW WHAT SUGAR YOU CAN AND CANT HAVE”




Example 3: *im adding pumps of syrup to a cup* 

Customer: “oh I only wanted two pumps of syrup” 

Me: “oh ok no problem”  *throws cup away and restarts* 

Me: *adding 3 shots of espresso to the cup*

Customer: “oh I actually only wanted 2 shots of espresso” 

Me: “sure no problem” *restarts drink AGAIN*

Me: *hands customer their drink 

Customer: “ oh thank you and this is decaf right cause I can only drink decaf” 

Me: no so unfortunately you didn’t specify any of these alterations when ordering so the drink is not decaf but I can remake it for you”

1i5fk5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1i5fk5c/trip_report_tamarindo/,Trip Report - Tamarindo,"This forum was so helpful when planning our trip I wanted to report back for anyone else doing their own research. I was super hesitant about going to Tamarindo, we have been to CR 4 times and loved it, but this time we were meeting up with a group of extended family from 12 - 80 and for various reasons (transfer from airport, cost of accomodations, beachfront availability/etc) Tamarindo fit the bill.  After staying there for 10 nights (we started off solo in Obandito - Suitree hotel which was amazing, and finished off also by ourselves at Borinquen Thermal Lodge in Rincon De La Vieja, also amazing) I can see the issues with Tamarindo, and I can see why people don't like parts of it, but honestly for our group it worked really well.

Stay - we stayed at a VRBO, Villa Cascada, and it was fabulous, a huge part of why we had a good time,It is at the ""quieter"" end of the beach (which is still busy), but it was a beautiful home, suited a larger group, had an awesome location where you can walk out right from the house to the beach, and was an excellent home base ,

Transport - We had the Villa arrange transport for our extended family for pickup/dropoff to LIberia airport (we drove in from our previous location and out to the next location). When we were there we rented a 6 person golf cart and a side by side for the rest of our group from Rent Me Tamarindo. Other than being over 2 hours late for drop off, they were good. The vehicles were in good shape and the side by side was so much fun. The side by side was expensive to rent, but we ripped that thing up to Playa Grande and down to Playa Avellena and everywhere in between and it was so much more fun than a car.   The electric golf cart was perfectly serviceable to get around town, they have a limited area where you can drive it (you can basically take the side by side anywhere), which was fine, it just struggled a bit if you wanted to get up to the top of the hills for views/etc.  I was worried that it would not be safe to drive around at night/etc but it was well lit and perfectly safe within town. Walking was even fine at night, it is so busy that we never felt alone/unsafe. 

Food/Restaurants - we shopped at the Auto Mercado and various other shops in town and cooked breakfasts/lunches/etc on our own. We also shopped at the Farmers Market, and the General Store Mentha & Limón which had great frozen burgers. There is a guy on the beach in Tarmarindo (near the shipwreck on the beach) who is a fisherman who sells fresh fish, we found him there around 9am.   

We hired a private chef for one night through the villa, and we had Ben & Arthur Chefs [www.instagram.com/ben\_arthur\_chefs/](http://www.instagram.com/ben_arthur_chefs/) in to cook for us for 4 nights (1 night delivery, 3 nights in house). They were AMAZING. Great to work with, food was excellent, nice people, and yes it was pricey but when you think what you'd spend for a restaurant and we were able to enjoy (in my opinion) better than restaurant food in the comfort of our beautiful rental, it was so worth it.  One night we went to L'Estanco , which had been recommended to us. It was a lovely setting, food was very good, drinks were great. Another night we went to Pangas - setting was beautiful, food and service merely adequate.  We also took a trip up the hill to the Wyndham a couple of times for a drink/coffee overlooking the bay - you can't see the sunset from there but the view in the day is great. Another night the group went to the Tamarindo Food Truck Market and that was a fun experience from them and everyone really liked the different foods available. 

Wine - Since we were at a VRBO, we needed to buy our own booze for dinners/etc. We bought some at the AutoMercado, selection was okay. We found The Wine Break, which had a better selection (but it is expensive) for some ""treat"" wines. There is a Discount Italian Store which had some Nebbiolos available (and some food), and the Pura Vida Licorera had a better more affordable French rose selection.

Coffee - we had a drip machine at the VRBO but some of our group were real earlybirds/espresso drinkers. A couple mornings we walked to Cafe Nordico, most mornings we went to Breaking Bread. Breaking Bread Americanos were best, their baked goods and fresh bread were great.

Things to do - Farmers Market was cute - for souvenirs not so much but if you are buying your own food the produce there was the best selection, and they had some baked goods and other stands that were worth checking out. 

Walking the beach in the morning never got old, it was beautiful and you can walk around the point at low tide or up and over the point (stairwell goes up) over to Playa Langosta which has portions of black sand. 

I did yoga on the beach several times with [https://www.instagram.com/virginia\_marie\_yoga/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/virginia_marie_yoga/?hl=en) and she was great. You can reserve ahead of time which I think is best, through her site, or show up. 

We did an Estuary tour with Discover Tamarindo and it was so educational, comfortable and enjoyable - everyone in our group loved it, you see so much and Christian, our guide was excellent.

We did a private tour on a catamaran called the Bali out of Playa Flamingo, with Manta Ray Tours. It was pricey, but sooooo worth it. At the end of the trip when everyone was recalling their favourite moments, this was universally in the top. We did the afternoon/sunset tour and food/booze is included so we even got a great casual meal out of it (no one needed dinner).  It was a bit of a drive to get there but the boat is amazing, crew is friendly and overall the experience was a 10/10.

Massage on the beach - I was pretty wary of this but after seeing person after person come and see the woman who did the massages right outside the back gate of our VRBO, I decided to give it a try. Her name is Lourdes and she was EXCELLENT.  There are a lot of people offering massages on the beach, for now the best directions are that she is on the beach side directly behind the El Nido Complex., immediately to the north of the Langosta beach Club, by the trees to the path to the El Nido rentals, just before the vacant lot.

Drives/Other Beaches  - we took trips to Playa Avellena (longer drive on rough road, but a lovely beach with a great beachfront restaurant, you have to pay to park you can then head to the beach/get lunch at the beachfront restaurant/rent loungers at the beachfront loungers), and we took a trip over to Playa Grande (again, great beach, fun swimming with decent shade under trees).

Adventure - we're pretty low key and did not do much in this respect.  My nephew did do an ultralight flight I think with Autogyro Tamarindo and for him, this was the best part of the trip. We saw the video and it looked totally thrilling and a really unique experience. 

Family Photos - we did a family photoshoot one evening at sunset with Genna at Tamarindo Family Photos and I can't say enough good things about her. The pictures are awesome - and she was patient, kind, knew what she was doing, encouraging, and really reasonable when you see how many photos you get/ how good they are.

I hope this helps anyone else planning in the area. Thanks to everyone who posted previously who were so helpful to us.",1,1737338924.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

Context: I have anorexia/ purging sub type and orthorexia. So I don’t binge on trigger foods, I only eat safe clean foods. So, Last night I so desperately wanted to not purge. I can’t even get ONE day under my belt. The only time in the last year I’ve gone without purging is one day in August. I am so fucking exhausted and burned out. I’ve reached a level of emotional exhaustion and fatigue that I can’t handle anymore. The thought of eating my safe foods and purging them for the millionth time just completely debilitates me. So I decided, what if I just DIDNT eat? Just fucking liquid fast and eat as little as fucking possible. So that’s what I did. And I didn’t purge. I went to sleep but then woke up in the morning and was starving. I am pretty underweight and malnourished anyway. So I had hot tea drinks and decaf coffee and my protein sugar free pudding, and guess what, I STILL FUCKING PURGED. So I was able to go over 30 hours no purging but then purged immediately once I ate a little bit of pudding and non solids and felt too full. I can’t go to sleep if my stomach is combusting. This is fucking hell. So the only way to not purge is to just starve myself like the 2004 livejournal pro ana days when I didn’t eat for months and ended up in the hospital. I just want to be able to eat and just feel okay enough to not purge. But I’m sure in 9 hours after I eat I will be eating and feeling so physically uncomfortable until I purge. I’m damned if I do eat. I’m damned if I don’t eat, it’s all FUCKED ",1,1737338259.0,AnorexiaBingePurge,0,1.0,False
1i5fcae,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1i5fcae/m4f_fame_or_shame_long_term/,[M4F] Fame or Shame - Long Term,"Good morning, good afternoon or good evening to anyone who is reading this post! Half of the first month passed already! Time flies, for sure! 

Today I'm both looking and offering three ideas related with the fame and the money, two things people dream with but not everyone can reach. So why not playing a little bit with these dynamics with some slow romance in between!


[Extraordinariless] 

Famous people have their own problems, most of them very far from what the common people does. For them, a couple of thousand are nothing but small change. 
But, who doesn't want those problems? Well, you don't you, you just want a quiet life, with your routine. That's until someday, in your favorite coffee shop, you were just having a nice morning when the waiter brings something you didn't order and a small piece of paper with a username and a number below. Moved by the curiosity, you find that it's a well-known influencer, who now will try everything to make you fall in love with him. 

Are you accepting, knowing this will make your life quite more difficult? Or will you reject someone who is not used to have a 'no' for answer? 

[Oil/Water] [Romance] 


[Not my place, not my world] 

Across the room I can recognize so may famous people: actors, musicians, even I think I saw that guy in a commercial. 

Some of them comes to greet you, and even ask things. Things that seems to know pretty well, as...friends. Some of them even talk to me, asking me stuff. What should I say? Should I tell them the truth, saying I'm just a regular cashier or should I come up with a more interesting answer? 

I can't remember how I ended up here, surrounded by rich extravagant people. I want to run, but I also promised you I'll be at your side. 

[Oil / Water] [Slice Of Life]


[When reality surpasses fiction] 

We are in this togheter now. Maybe it was accidental, maybe it was the destiny gathering us, but now we can't reveal that we just met yesterday! Not after our numbers rises to the stars. Not when paparazzi are boosting out careers. 

Let's just make a deal. Tell what do you want and I'll tell you what my conditions are. But smile for the camera, sunshine. This is what sells. 

[Faked relationship] [Drama] 


This are the plots! To clarify a little more:

[Not my place, not my World] doesn't exactly aims for a direct love relation. Could also be orbiting about friends than split apart and met some time later with the difference that now one of them is famous! 

[When reality surpasses fiction] it's the most flexible one! Could be a Famous x Non famous dynamic, a Slightly Famous x Famous, Famous x Famous. Whoever can adopt any of the roles! The important part is the drama around faking a whole relationship, but who knows how it might end? 

If any idea catched your eye, send a DM and we can discuss the ideas! 

Will be waiting! :D",1,1737338247.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False
1i5fbrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i5fbrs/my_girlfriend_talks_in_her_sleep_last_night_she/,My Girlfriend Talks in Her Sleep. Last Night She Told Me Where the Bodies Are.,"If I’m being honest, I ignored the warning signs. I mean, wouldn’t you? Sharon was perfect—or at least, she seemed perfect at the time. She’s beautiful in that classic way that makes people stop and stare. Smart, too. She’s got a dry sense of humor that could cut glass, and she knows exactly how to use it.

We’ve been dating for eight months now. And yeah, maybe it was a little fast, but everything just *clicked*. From our first date, I knew I wanted her in my life. She felt like the total package—someone I could actually see myself building a future with.

Looking back, there were little things I should’ve paid more attention to.

It started on our fourth date. We were sitting on her couch, drinking wine, when she brought it up. “I should probably warn you about something,” she said, swirling her glass.

I raised an eyebrow, already half in love with her. “Oh? What’s that?”

“I’m not... the easiest person to sleep next to,” she said.

I laughed, thinking she was making a joke. “Don’t worry, I’ve shared a bed with snorers before. I think I can handle it.”

She shook her head, a small smile playing on her lips. “It’s not just snoring. I talk in my sleep. Sometimes I move around, or... well, I’ve even been known to slap people by accident.”

“Slap people, huh? Sounds like an occupational hazard,” I teased.

She gave me this look—half serious, half amused. “I’m just saying, it’s happened before. If you decide to stick around, you’ve been warned.”

At the time, I didn’t think much of it. It sounded harmless, even kind of *cute*. But looking back... yeah, I should’ve taken her more seriously.

The first time I stayed over at her place, I was anticipating a slap in my sleep just so I could poke fun at her about it the next morning. But for the most part, that first night was uneventful. She tossed and turned a little, muttering what sounded like random gibberish—”not the red one” and “don’t let it fall.” I barely noticed.

Over the next few weeks, her quirks started to come out more. One night, I woke up to her hand smacking me squarely in the chest.

“What the hell?” I mumbled, groggy and confused.

Sharon was still asleep, her arm falling limp against the bed.

The next morning, I brought it up over breakfast. “So... you hit me last night.”

She almost choked on her coffee, her eyes wide with mock horror. “I did?”

“Yup. Full-on smack. Guess you were dreaming about fighting someone.”

She grinned, shaking her head. “Maybe I was dreaming about Aaron.”

Aaron was her ex-husband. She didn’t talk about him much, but from what I gathered, their divorce had been messy. The way she said his name—half joking, half bitter—made me wonder if there was more to the story.

Still, I laughed it off. At the time, it didn’t seem like a big deal.

The warnings kept coming, however, in subtle ways I didn’t recognize for what they were.

A few weeks into staying over, Sharon brought it up again one night as we got into bed. “I wasn’t kidding about the sleep stuff, you know,” she said.

“I know,” I replied, pulling the covers over us. “Honestly, it’s not that bad. It’s sort of adorable.”

Her smile faltered for just a second. “Just... don’t freak out if I say something *weird*, okay?”

I gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. “Sharon, it’s no trouble, really. I think you’re perfect, and nothing you say in your sleep is going to change that.”

She smiled again, but this time it didn’t quite reach her eyes.

At the time, I thought it was nothing. Now I wish I’d taken that moment more seriously.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

The first few weeks of staying at Sharon’s place were normal enough. Sure, she moved a lot in her sleep—tossing, turning, even mumbling—but I figured it was just part of her “quirky” charm.

But then her topics of “conversation” changed–*dramatically*.

At first, she’d say things like “put that down” or “get the cat”—harmless nonsense—and I’d laugh about it the next morning. But one night, about a month in, I woke up to something different.

“It’s under the oak tree,” Sharon murmured, her voice low and steady.

I blinked, groggy and confused. “Sharon?”

She didn’t respond. Her body was still, her breathing slow and even.

I sat up and leaned closer. “What’s under the oak tree?”

Nothing. She didn’t say anything else, just rolled over and pulled the blanket tighter around herself.

The next morning, over breakfast, I brought it up.

“You said something weird in your sleep last night,” I told her.

Sharon raised an eyebrow, sipping her coffee. “Oh, yeah? What did I say?”

“It was... *strange*. You said, ‘It’s under the oak tree.’”

She tilted her head, like she was trying to figure out if I was joking. “Huh, that’s weird. Maybe it was about a treehouse or something.”

“Do you remember what you were dreaming about?”

She shook her head. “Nope. My dreams are unbelievably random. You know how it is.”

I nodded, but her answer didn’t sit right with me. There was something about the way she brushed it off—too casually, like she was trying to steer the conversation in another direction.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

A week later, I woke up to her pacing, circling the bed as if she was measuring the room.

“Sharon?” I whispered, rubbing my eyes.

She didn’t answer.

I reached for the bedside lamp, but as soon as I touched the switch, she stopped dead in her tracks.

“Don’t,” she said sharply.

My hand froze. “Don’t *what*?”

She didn’t respond. For a moment, she just stood there, then climbed back into bed, her movements stiff and robotic.

The next morning, I kept it to myself. I wanted to ask her about what she’d said, but something told me not to.

Things got worse after that.

One night, she sat straight up in bed and started muttering again. “Two miles from the highway,” she said, her voice calm and steady. “It works better when the ground is wet.”

I didn’t even try to wake her this time. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, feeling the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

When she finally rolled over and went quiet, I got up and went to the kitchen. My hands shook as I poured myself a glass of water.

*What the hell was going on?*

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The breaking point came a few nights later.

I woke up to Sharon sitting at the edge of the bed, her back to me.

“I told you it wouldn’t work,” she whispered.

I sat up slowly. “Sharon?”

She didn’t turn around. Her head tilted slightly, like she was listening to someone I couldn’t see.

“He said he’d take care of it, but he didn’t. Now it’s *my* problem.”

“Sharon, who are you talking to?” I asked.

She didn’t answer. Instead, she stood up and walked out of the bedroom. I didn’t follow her. I just sat there, frozen, listening to her footsteps fade down the hall.

When I woke up the next morning, she was already in the kitchen, humming to herself as she flipped pancakes. She looked up and smiled when she saw me.

“Good morning!” she said cheerfully.

I forced a smile, but my stomach churned. I couldn’t stop thinking about the things she’d said in her sleep.

The night I realized something was really wrong started like any other. Sharon fell asleep quickly, curled up on her side, while I stayed awake scrolling on my phone. Everything seemed normal until I heard her voice.

At first, I thought she was speaking to me. “I held his nose shut,” she said.

I froze.

Her voice was low, cold, almost monotone. “It didn’t take long. He kicked for a while, but then he stopped.”

I turned to her. Sharon was still lying on her side, breathing slowly.

“Sharon?” I whispered.

She didn’t respond.

Her voice dropped to a whisper. “Dragged him down the embankment. The soil was soft—perfect for digging.”

“What the hell?” I muttered under my breath.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The next morning, I confronted her. “You were talking in your sleep again last night.”

Sharon glanced up from her coffee, looking amused. “Oh, no–really? What did I say this time? I hope it wasn’t anything embarrassing.”

I hesitated. “You... you said something about suffocating someone. And digging a grave.”

She frowned. “That’s... *weird*. Maybe a nightmare about one of those crime shows I watch. You know how much Netflix I binge.”

She laughed, but it didn’t feel genuine.

“You don’t remember what you were dreaming about?” I pressed.

Sharon shook her head. “No, sorry. Honestly, Chris, I never remember any of my dreams.”

I nodded, but I suspected she wasn’t telling me everything.

A few nights later, I woke up to her voice again.

“Max,” she said. Her tone was calm, detached.

I sat up in bed, my skin crawling.

“He’s behind the old barn,” she continued. “The one with the blue door.”

The name was familiar. A young man named Max had gone missing years ago while on a camping trip. His case was *still* unsolved.

The next morning, I didn’t bring it up. I didn’t know how to. But I couldn’t get the name—or her *words*—out of my head.

I Googled Max’s name on my phone. His disappearance had happened in the next county over. There was no mention in the reports of a barn or a blue door, but the other details Sharon had mentioned matched the description of the area where he’d last been seen.

A few days later, I worked up the courage to suggest something to Sharon. She was grinning when I first approached.

“Have you ever thought about doing a sleep study?” I asked carefully.

Her smile faded. “Why would I do that, Chris?”

“I don’t know. Just... you’ve been saying some really strange things in your sleep. Maybe it’s stress, or something.”

“I’m fine,” she said, shaking her head. “You’re overthinking it.”

“What about recording it?” I said. “Just so you can hear it for yourself.”

Her expression darkened instantly. “No. Absolutely not. That’s a huge invasion of privacy.”

“I wasn’t trying to—”

“If you ever record me without my permission, Chris, we’re done. I mean it.”

Our eyes met, I nodded, and we went on with our day. Inside, however, my world was unraveling.

That night, after she fell asleep, I couldn’t help myself. I propped my phone under a pillow on her side of the bed and hit “record.”

The next morning, while Sharon was in the shower, I played back the audio file.

At first, it was just static. Then, around 2 am, her voice came through, clear as day.

“Nina screamed too much,” Sharon murmured. “Fast–had to move fast. No mistakes.”

I froze.

*Nina*. I knew her, too. A teenager by that name had disappeared five years ago–and her case was still open.

*No, it couldn’t be*, I thought. *This isn’t impossible.*

I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I had to know if what she was saying was true.

That afternoon, I drove to one of the locations Sharon had described: a barn with a blue door. It wasn’t far—about twenty minutes outside of town.

I found it easily enough. The building was old and weathered, its door faded to a dull gray.

Behind the barn was a small grove of trees. The soil beneath them looked disturbed, like someone had dug there recently.

I told myself to leave, but I couldn’t. I grabbed a nearby stick and started scraping at the dirt.

I didn’t have to dig for long. The smell–pungent and unmistakable–hit me first. Then I saw it: a torn, dirt-streaked patch of fabric, clinging to what I could only describe as... *remains*.

I stumbled back. My head swam as I struggled to process what I was looking at.

Sharon hadn’t been dreaming.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I couldn’t stop myself. Every night after Sharon fell asleep, I set up my phone to record. And every morning, while she showered or made coffee, I reviewed what she’d said.

It was always the same.

“She kept crying, so I had to do it fast. It wasn’t clean,” she’d said. ”She’s in the quarry now. The water keeps her hidden.”

The names changed, but the pattern didn’t. Every night, Sharon whispered something chilling, something specific.

“Beneath the roots, that’s the trick,” she’d one one night. “No one *ever* checks beneath the roots.”

Every morning, I woke up more terrified than the last.

The audio files piled up, each one a piece of a horrifying puzzle. I couldn’t deny it anymore. These weren’t *dreams*.

They were *confessions*.

Sharon started to notice something was off.

“You’ve been quiet lately,” she said one morning, sliding a plate of scrambled eggs across the table.

“Just tired,” I muttered, avoiding her eyes.

“You’re *always* tired these days,” she said, tilting her head. “Is something bothering you?”

“No,” I lied. “Nothing.”

She studied me for a moment, her gaze sharp and unblinking, and then smiled. “Okay.”

After that, I felt she watched me more closely, just waiting for me to slip up.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

One night, she caught me.

I thought she was asleep. I was sitting on the couch, headphones plugged into my phone, listening to the latest recording.

“I told him I’d take care of it,” Sharon whispered in the recording. “But he didn’t listen. I had to clean up his mess.”

The sound of her voice made my skin crawl.

“What are you doing, Chris?”

I jumped, yanking the headphones out of my ears. Sharon was standing in the hallway, her arms crossed over her chest.

“Nothing!” I said quickly, locking my phone and shoving it into my pocket.

Her eyes narrowed. “Were you just listening to something?”

“No,” I stammered. “I was just... scrolling through Instagram.”

She didn’t move. Her expression didn’t change. She just stood there, *staring* at me.

“Let me see your phone,” she said finally.

“What?” I said, laughing nervously.

“I said, give me your phone, Chris.”

“Why?”

“Because I think you’re lying to me.”

I stood up, trying to keep my voice calm. “Sharon, you’re being ridiculous.”

“Am I?” she said, taking a step closer. “You’ve been acting weird for *weeks*. Avoiding me. Locking your phone. What are you hiding?”

“Nothing!” I said. “Why would you think I—”

“Then let me see it,” she said, cutting me off.

“No.”

The word came out sharper than I’d intended.

Sharon’s voice was cold and flat. “You recorded me, didn’t you?”

A wave of dread washed over me. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

She took another step forward. “While I was sleeping–you recorded me. Admit it.”

“Sharon, I—”

“Give me the phone, Chris.”

“No.”

She lunged at me, her fingers clawing for my pocket. I stumbled back, trying to push her away, but she was relentless.

“Give it to me!” she screamed, her voice echoing through the apartment.

I twisted out of her grip and ran for the door.

I didn’t stop running until I reached my car. My hands shook so badly that it took me three tries to get the key into the ignition.

As I pulled out of the parking lot, I glanced back at the building. Sharon was standing at the window, watching me.

I didn’t go back for my things, not even my phone.

The next day, I logged into my cloud account from a public library computer.

The recordings were gone.

Sharon must have found a way to delete them.

I sat there, staring at the empty folder. All the evidence, every scrap of proof, was *gone*.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I didn’t go to the police. I couldn’t.

What was I supposed to say? That my girlfriend confessed to a dozen murders in her sleep? That I found a body exactly where she said it would be? They’d laugh me out of the station—or worse, they’d think I was involved. And without the recordings, I had nothing but my word.

Instead, I did the only thing I could think of: I ran.

I drove straight to the next town over, checked into a cheap motel, and spent the rest of the night staring at the cracked ceiling, trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do.

The next morning, I bought a new phone with cash. It was nothing fancy, just a basic model that could make calls and access my cloud account–not that it mattered. The recordings had vanished. Every file I’d backed up had been erased.

She’d found a way to delete them. 

For weeks, I stayed in the motel, keeping my head down and jumping at every sound outside my door. I just *knew* Sharon was out there, watching, waiting for the right moment to strike.

I avoided social media, too afraid she would use it to track me down. The only thing I kept up with was the news. Every morning, I scrolled through local crime reports, praying I wouldn’t see her name—or worse, hear that another body had been discovered.

At first, there was nothing. No missing persons or disappearances, no murders. For a moment, I let myself believe that maybe I’d scared her enough to stop.

Then the killings started again.

It was small things at first: a man found strangled in his home, a woman’s body pulled from a lake. Both in neighboring counties, the circumstances eerily similar to the stories Sharon had whispered in her sleep.

I told myself it was just a coincidence. It *had* to be.

But then it got closer.

A teenage girl went missing from my hometown, her bike found abandoned on the side of the road just a mile from where I grew up.

A week later, her body was discovered in a shallow grave beneath a grove of trees.

I couldn’t breathe when I saw the report. The site matched Sharon’s description *exactly*: ““Beneath the roots, that’s the trick. No one *ever* checks beneath the roots.”

It was *her*. It *had* to be.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The breaking point came when the news reported another victim–my cousin, Riley. 

Riley and I weren’t close, not anymore, but we’d grown up together. She was the kind of person who lit up every room she walked into—always smiling and laughing.

When I saw her name on the news feed, I felt like the floor had been ripped out from under me.

The reporter said she’d been found near the same grove where the teenager’s body had been discovered. They didn’t give any details, but I already knew what they weren’t saying.

I *knew* it was Sharon.

For days, I couldn’t eat or sleep. All I could think about was Riley—how I could’ve stopped this if I’d done something sooner. If I’d gone to the police, or told someone, anyone, about what Sharon had said.

But I hadn’t. I’d run away like a coward, and now Riley was *dead*.

The guilt was suffocating.

I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life, but running away from Sharon has to be the worst.

I thought leaving would save me. I thought it would keep her from finding out how much I knew. But the truth is, it didn’t save Riley. It didn’t save *anyone*.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I can’t keep this to myself anymore. I don’t care if no one believes me, or if people think I’m crazy. Even if it put a target on my back—I have to tell someone, have to do *something*.

For days, I’ve sat here, trying to find the right words. Words that might make someone believe me. Words that might *stop* her.

But the truth is, I don’t think it matters anymore–Riley is dead, and it’s my fault.

I can’t stop seeing her face on the news. I can’t stop hearing my mom’s voice on the phone, shaking as she told me what happened.

I could’ve done something. I could’ve stopped Sharon.

But I didn’t. I ran.

My hands are shaking, my head is pounding, and my chest feels tight–but I have to get it out. I just need someone to know.

Her name is Sharon. She’s smart, beautiful, perfect on the outside. 

And she’s a murderer.

She’s confessed to everything: Max, Nina, all of them. She described how she did it, where she buried them. I thought it was just dreams at first. God, I wanted to believe it was just dreams. But I found one of them. I dug where she said to dig–and there he was.

I tried running. I thought if I stayed quiet, she’d let me go. But the killings never stopped.

I suppose I want someone to know the truth before she finds me.

Because she will.

It’s just a matter of time.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

There’s a noise.

I freeze, my fingers hovering over the keyboard.

I hear the sound of glass breaking. Of footsteps–slow, and steady, coming from the kitchen.

A wave of nausea overwhelms me. I grab the gun from my nightstand, my hands trembling so badly I nearly drop it.

Oh, God. She’s here.

I don’t know if I’ll make it out of this. If I disappear, you’ll know why.

If anyone finds this, *please...*

Don’t let her get away [with](https://www.creepypastastories.com/authors/craig-groshek) [it.](https://www.youtube.com/user/chillingtaleswi)",8,1737338202.0,nosleep,2,0.83,False
1i5fb9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1i5fb9k/just_the_flu/,JUST THE FLU,"I put on my running shoes with springs, designed to cushion the impact on the ground. It was my nightly ritual, something I did every single day without fail: running to the neighboring town, keeping my body busy and my mind free of thoughts. It was almost five o’clock, and the sun still stubbornly lingered in the sky, painting everything with a pale golden light.

I opened the door and was greeted by a strange smell. A mix of dampness and decay floated in the air, coming from somewhere behind me. The rotting stench made me wrinkle my nose, but I ignored it. I needed to run. I started climbing the hill, the wind against my face. I passed the entrance to the interstate highway, maintaining a steady pace. I was running at about 4 km/h, a moderate speed to warm up. I crossed the rusty sign that read “No Passing” and smirked bitterly.“Who’s going to pass you now?” I murmured to myself, my voice lost in the emptiness of the road. I kept running along the highway, the sound of my shoes hitting the wet asphalt echoing in the silence. When I approached the old brothel, a shiver ran down my spine. The place had been creepy at its best, but now… The sign that once announced the brothel’s name—something vulgar and flashy—lay fallen beside the building, which now resembled a charred carcass. The letters were faded, the wood that had supported the structure blackened and twisted like burned bones, and the windows were nothing but dark, empty holes that seemed to watch me as I passed.

The brothel was near a lake that used to reflect the vibrant, colorful lights of the facade on festive nights. Now, the water was dark, with an oily sheen under the faint light remaining from the day. The shore was littered with debris—broken bottles, pieces of wood that seemed to be parts of the building, and something that looked like a piece of red fabric.

A horrible smell emanated from the area, thicker than the stench of death I had encountered earlier. It was like a mix of rot and burning, as if decay itself had permeated the air. I looked at the entrance and saw that the old double doors, which used to spin open to welcome customers, were fallen, lying wide open on the ground. Inside, everything was in ruins: overturned tables, broken chairs, and what appeared to be dark stains on the floor and walls. Climbing the next hill, I spotted the reservoir of an abandoned property. The silence there was oppressive, broken only by the distant sound of thunder. The old farmhouse loomed like a ghostly shadow in the landscape. The main house was partially collapsed, with loose planks creaking in the wind, and the windows, which had once reflected life within, were now empty, like soulless eye sockets.

As I got closer, the smell of death grew stronger. In the yard, a man lay near the porch, his face covered in dried blood, flies buzzing around him. His glazed-over eyes seemed fixed on a point in the horizon that no longer existed. The ground around him was marked by erratic footprints and dark stains, as if someone had fought to survive there. Some children’s toys were still scattered across the dead lawn, creating a disturbing contrast to the scene of destruction. The trees around swayed in the wind, their branches like thin arms pointing toward the now cloud-covered sky.

In the stable, a few dead animals lay sprawled. The cow, still with blood on its muzzle, seemed to have collapsed recently. The horses lay beside it, their swollen bodies exuding that now all-too-familiar stench of decay. However, amidst this scene of horror, one pig was still alive, wandering among the corpses with hesitant steps, as if searching for a reason to be there. A few chickens pecked at the ground indifferently, their feathers stained with mud and blood. I passed through the fallen fence. Over the next hill, I spotted the reservoir of a place that seemed to have been abandoned long ago. The farmhouse appeared in the distance, shrouded in an ominous gloom. The trees around it, twisted by the wind, cast unsettling shadows over the waterlogged ground. As I got closer, the smell of blood mixed with decay hit my nose like a punch, making the air almost unbreathable.

In the yard of the house, a man lay sprawled, his face marked with dark patches of dried blood. His lifeless eyes stared up at the sky, as if searching for an answer that never came. The wooden porch creaked in the wind, and the door hung from its last nails, swaying slowly like a clock marking the end of time.

I moved forward and passed a truck stuck in the mud. The engine was off, and the vehicle looked as though it had been swallowed by the earth. Inside the cab, a man was slumped over the steering wheel, motionless. The putrid stench emanating from it was suffocating, but I no longer afforded myself the luxury of being bothered. I ran further, my footsteps echoing on the straight road leading me to the next town.

As I passed by a motel, it stood empty. The neon sign, which had likely once flickered incessantly, was dark and covered in soot. On the ground, bodies were scattered: prostitutes lying awkwardly, as if felled by an invisible force. The abandoned cars around the area told another story—a desperate escape, cut short before reaching its destination. The vehicles now came from the opposite direction, as if everyone was fleeing the city I had just left behind. The stench of decay permeated the air, a smell I was beginning to accept as part of my new reality. The sky grew darker, illuminated only by distant lightning. The stars, now almost fully visible, shone over the dead city. There were no more electric lights, no signs of life. A flash of lightning revealed the body of a small child, no older than five, lying next to her mother. They were holding each other, as if trying to protect one another until the very last moment.

Just one month. A single month, and everything was gone. There weren’t many people left now—perhaps no one but me. I thought about it as memories flooded my mind. I remembered school, before everything shut down for good. I thought of my girlfriend, my friends. All dead. Their families, too. Why am I still alive? That question echoes in my head every day. Why me? Why didn’t I die along with them? Along with everyone else? The Red Plague took everything but left me here, alone, wandering through this open-air cemetery.

As I run down this deserted road, my mind keeps revisiting the past, as if to torture me. I remember what the world was like before it all collapsed. Streets full of people, smiles, laughter. I remember going to school, complaining about classes, but secretly enjoying the routine, my friends, the small things that made me feel alive. My girlfriend… I remember her. I remember what it felt like to hold her hand, hear her laugh, feel the warmth of her embrace. Now, all that’s left of her is a memory that cuts like a knife buried deep in my chest.

My friends… Matheus, the one I used to joke around with, watch people at the mall, crack dumb jokes. We laughed like the world could never end. My mother. She died in my arms on the 22nd. That day is etched into me like a scar that will never fade. I held her as she drowned in her own blood, swollen, her eyes red and blind, unable to see me one last time. She tried to say something, but the words got stuck. And then she was gone. I can’t shake the feeling of her body growing cold in my arms.

I remember how happy we were with so little. I remember afternoons at the mall, eating McDonald’s and people-watching, everyone busy with their normal lives. I remember the conversations, the jokes. The sound of children laughing, the music playing in the stores, the smell of coffee and burgers. Now, all of it feels like a distant dream, something that was never real.

I even miss the things I once found annoying. The lines, the traffic jams, the bills. I’d give anything to have a life where those were my biggest concerns again. Now, all I have is silence. A silence broken only by the sound of my own footsteps and the wind carrying the stench of death. It’s as if the whole world is frozen, stuck in a single moment. One month. Just one month, and it was all over. The world, which took centuries to build, collapsed in weeks. And I was left here, to watch it all end.

Heavy clouds rolled above me, dense and full of rain, occasionally lit by lightning streaking across the horizon. The smell of wet earth began to mix with the stench of decomposition, creating a suffocating sensation. The wind howled around me, cold and damp, as if trying to push me away from this place.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, drawing closer, like the footsteps of an invisible giant. When the first drop fell on my face, it was almost a relief, a reminder that the world still had something alive, something not consumed by the plague. The rain came suddenly, strong and relentless, drenching everything within seconds. The lightning illuminated the field around me, revealing a landscape that seemed ripped straight from a nightmare. Bodies were scattered everywhere, lying in random positions, as if the world had frozen at the moment of its greatest tragedy. Some were still in abandoned cars, others sprawled on the ground where death had caught up to them. Water ran over the corpses, washing away dust and blood, but it couldn’t erase the smell. That smell… No matter how much time passed, I knew I’d never forget it.

I kept running, feeling the heavy rain pounding against my clothes and skin, while my thoughts drifted back to things that now seemed impossible. I’d give anything to be home, on a normal day, eating a poorly made burger from some random diner, accompanied by greasy fries. Ice cream… How I miss ice cream. That feeling of cold sweetness melting on your tongue, dripping slowly as you try to savor every second. I’d give anything for ice cream right now. Or even something simpler: a glass of clean, drinkable water straight from the tap. Water that didn’t taste like rust or death.

I wondered what it would be like to sit in my room, playing video games, with the soft glow of the screen lighting up the space. And the internet… I remember how annoyed I used to get when it went out for a few seconds. Now, I’d trade my life to hear that annoying sound of a notification ping on my phone, any sign that the world still existed outside my head.

Electricity was another thing I’d taken for granted. Just turning on a light when entering a room, opening the fridge to find fresh food, or turning on the TV to watch something stupid. All of that had seemed so small before, but now it was an unattainable luxury.

The rain kept falling, heavier and heavier, as I looked up at the sky. Lightning flashed again, and more bodies appeared on the horizon. Children, mothers, men—people who once had dreams and worries just like me. Now they were there, motionless, as if they’d become part of the landscape. Why am I still here?” I asked myself as the water streamed down my face, mixing with the tears I no longer tried to hold back. They called it INF-1, the Beijing Flu, but I like to call it the end of the world. I don’t know exactly how it started. In Germany, it felt like we were safe at first. “The virus is far away,” the newspapers said. “We’re taking all the necessary measures.” Frankfurt Airport. A couple coming from Asia—nothing the government couldn’t control. That’s what they said.

Within days, hospitals began to overflow. It was like an invisible storm sweeping through entire cities. Berlin fell first, like a tree rotted from the roots. Suddenly, the streets were empty, except for ambulance sirens and muffled screams from behind windows. No one wanted to leave their homes, but it didn’t matter. INF-1 didn’t need you to be close to others. It found you anyway.

Bavaria, where I am now, was no different. The flu came like a shadow, silent at first, then brutal. Stores emptied. Schools closed. Train stations became packed with people trying to escape—to where, no one knew. I saw entire families crammed into train cars, coughing, unaware they were carrying death with them.

The virus was relentless. Symptoms started like an ordinary cold: a mild fever, a cough you’d ignore any other time. But within hours, people began drowning in their own blood. I saw my mother die like that. In my arms. Her face swollen, her eyes red, blind, as if her own body had turned against her.

Doctors disappeared first. Some died trying to save others, others simply vanished—maybe fleeing. I don’t blame them. Who could stand against this?

Germany had disaster plans, of course. We always did. Protocols for everything, from terrorist attacks to pandemics. But INF-1 laughed in the face of all of them. There was no way to track something spreading so quickly. No way to stop something that killed before you even knew you were infected. I remember the last time I watched the news. The anchor was a shadow of her former self, coughing between sentences as she read the numbers. “Seventeen million dead in Europe. The government has declared a national state of emergency.” Then the broadcast cut off. It never came back.

Now, Germany is nothing but a corpse. An entire country turned into an open-air graveyard. The cities that once pulsed with life are deserted, filled only with abandoned cars and bodies slumped in the back seats. Houses that once felt like fortresses are now empty, except for signs of struggle—overturned furniture, bloodstains on the walls, locked doors that no one will ever open again.

The smell… That’s the worst. You never get used to it. Decomposition has taken over everything. The air is heavy, as if the very environment is dying alongside the people. I wonder if it’ll ever go away. Maybe not. Maybe that’s INF-1’s final legacy.

I think about who we were before all this. Wealthy people driving luxury cars, living in expensive apartments, making plans for the future. Now, we’re all the same. It doesn’t matter if you were a banker, a teacher, or someone like me. INF-1 didn’t discriminate. It just took. Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg, Berlin. All wiped out. Just the flu. It didn’t need a war. It didn’t need bombs or tanks. All it took was a virus.

I wonder if anyone else survived somewhere. If there are others like me, trying to make sense of why we’re still here. I used to ask myself every day: why didn’t I die with the others? Why didn’t I catch the Red Flu? Why was I the only one who made it through? But you know what? Screw it. The answer doesn’t change anything. I walked to a dusty shelf in a local market and found a forgotten chocolate bar. It was slightly squished, the wrapper worn, but it was still chocolate. I picked it up, unwrapped it slowly, and took a bite, tasting the sweetness, though strange, as if my sense of taste wasn’t the same anymore. While rummaging through the market, I saw a man lying next to the ATM. He had died there, his card still in hand. Dried blood pooled around him, and the air was thick with the stench of decaying flesh.

I continued along the straight road, the soles of my shoes echoing on the cracked asphalt. The city appeared on the horizon, like all the others. Dead. Silent. The same scene I had memorized by now. As I got closer, I saw the city sign at the entrance, charred, the remnants of the name burned and unrecognizable. The metal was twisted, as if it had passed through hell.

On the streets, thousands of abandoned cars clogged the roads, blocking any chance of passage. Many drivers were still inside, dead, their bodies strapped in by seatbelts. Some had their heads slumped against the steering wheels; others had their eyes open, frozen. I kept walking, the stench of death hanging in the air around me. I passed over a speed bump and saw an old woman lying next to it. Her white hair was tangled, and her skin, dry and pale, seemed almost fused with the concrete. Further ahead, a man lay on the sidewalk, his fingers still outstretched toward his house’s door. Maybe he had tried to go back for something. Maybe he thought he’d be safe inside. It didn’t matter.

The world didn’t end with explosions or anything grand. There wasn’t a meteor tearing across the sky or volcanoes spewing fire. It wasn’t a nuclear war reducing everything to ashes, or electromagnetic pulses wiping out technology. It was just a flu. A flu no one could stop. INF-1, the Red Flu, silent and deadly, erased centuries of civilization in mere weeks.

I looked at the city again—its empty streets, silent homes, stores left open with looted shelves. The world collapsed because of something so small we couldn’t even see it. Just the flu. That was enough to destroy everything we had built.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, announcing the approaching rain, and the wind turned colder. A flash of lightning illuminated the street ahead, revealing more bodies. I saw a small child lying next to a bicycle, a school backpack spilled open behind them. A few steps farther, there was another body—what looked like the child’s mother, arms outstretched, trying to shield her until the very last moment.

Has this happened before? Did another civilization, at some point, fall to something this simple? Thick raindrops began to fall hard, bursting against the asphalt, forming puddles that seemed like distorted mirrors of the sky. The wind howled, sharp and biting, and the thunder punched through the air, making the ground tremble beneath my feet. The city was dead, but it felt like nature itself wanted to remind me there was still power in the world, even if only to destroy what was left. I ran. My steps splashed water in every direction as I searched for any place to take shelter. The cold cut through my skin, and the heavy rain-soaked clothes clung to my body, making every movement harder. I looked around, but everything seemed empty, desolate. Silent buildings, broken windows, abandoned cars forming a useless labyrinth. With each flash of lightning, the scene lit up for a second, revealing details I wished I couldn’t see: corpses scattered in the streets, some half-submerged in puddles, others lying in impossible positions, like ragdolls.

Finally, I spotted a small house with open windows and a door slightly ajar. I ran toward it, ignoring the smell coming from inside. I already knew what I’d find, but I had no choice. I stepped in, pushing the creaking door open, and shut it behind me to block out the wind. Inside, the smell was almost suffocating: mold, decay, and something sickly sweet I couldn’t identify.

The living room was filled with dusty furniture, papers scattered on the floor, and dark stains on the walls. On the couch, a couple sat—or what was left of them. Both had swollen faces and dark patches around their mouths and noses, their hands still clasped together as if they had faced death united. The sight made my stomach twist, but I looked away. I didn’t have the energy to care anymore.

I kept exploring, moving down a narrow hallway. In one of the bedrooms, I found more bodies—children this time. A little girl held a bloodstained teddy bear, and a boy lay beside her, staring blankly at the ceiling. I left quickly. I couldn’t stay in that room another second.

But outside, the rain was an impenetrable wall. Lightning illuminated the broken windows, and the thunder was so loud it felt like it shook the house’s walls. I sat on the kitchen floor, leaning against an old refrigerator, trying to ignore the constant dripping sound from the countless leaks in the ceiling. My stomach growled, and hunger felt like a knife lodged in my body.

I looked around, my eyes adjusting to the dim light. Then, I saw it: the fridge. I crawled to it, my hands trembling from the cold and anxiety. I yanked the door open, and the smell that poured out was almost as bad as the one in the living room—rotten food, spoiled meat, and liquid remnants pooling at the bottom. Even so, I kept searching. Among the empty packages and moldy containers, I found something that felt like a miracle: a can of soup, still sealed.

My fingers gripped the can like it was gold. I checked the expiration date—it was good until next year. I laughed to myself, a dry, strange sound, because who cared about expiration dates now? I took the can and rummaged through the kitchen for something to open it. Finally, I found a rusty can opener.

When I managed to open the can, the smell of the soup wasn’t exactly appetizing, but it was still food. The rain kept pounding outside, but in that moment, with the can of soup in my hands, I felt more human than I had in weeks.

I ate the soup cold, straight from the can. The salty liquid and mushy bits of vegetables filled my empty stomach, and for a moment, the terrible taste didn’t matter. It was warmth in a cold world. It was life in a world of death.

I leaned against the wall, listening as the thunder slowly drifted farther away. Outside, the world was finished, but here, with that empty can by my side, I allowed myself a moment of peace.",1,1737338160.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

1i5faj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1i5faj5/just_the_flu/,JUST THE FLU,"I put on my running shoes with springs, designed to cushion the impact on the ground. It was my nightly ritual, something I did every single day without fail: running to the neighboring town, keeping my body busy and my mind free of thoughts. It was almost five o’clock, and the sun still stubbornly lingered in the sky, painting everything with a pale golden light.

I opened the door and was greeted by a strange smell. A mix of dampness and decay floated in the air, coming from somewhere behind me. The rotting stench made me wrinkle my nose, but I ignored it. I needed to run. I started climbing the hill, the wind against my face. I passed the entrance to the interstate highway, maintaining a steady pace. I was running at about 4 km/h, a moderate speed to warm up. I crossed the rusty sign that read “No Passing” and smirked bitterly.“Who’s going to pass you now?” I murmured to myself, my voice lost in the emptiness of the road. I kept running along the highway, the sound of my shoes hitting the wet asphalt echoing in the silence. When I approached the old brothel, a shiver ran down my spine. The place had been creepy at its best, but now… The sign that once announced the brothel’s name—something vulgar and flashy—lay fallen beside the building, which now resembled a charred carcass. The letters were faded, the wood that had supported the structure blackened and twisted like burned bones, and the windows were nothing but dark, empty holes that seemed to watch me as I passed.

The brothel was near a lake that used to reflect the vibrant, colorful lights of the facade on festive nights. Now, the water was dark, with an oily sheen under the faint light remaining from the day. The shore was littered with debris—broken bottles, pieces of wood that seemed to be parts of the building, and something that looked like a piece of red fabric.

A horrible smell emanated from the area, thicker than the stench of death I had encountered earlier. It was like a mix of rot and burning, as if decay itself had permeated the air. I looked at the entrance and saw that the old double doors, which used to spin open to welcome customers, were fallen, lying wide open on the ground. Inside, everything was in ruins: overturned tables, broken chairs, and what appeared to be dark stains on the floor and walls. Climbing the next hill, I spotted the reservoir of an abandoned property. The silence there was oppressive, broken only by the distant sound of thunder. The old farmhouse loomed like a ghostly shadow in the landscape. The main house was partially collapsed, with loose planks creaking in the wind, and the windows, which had once reflected life within, were now empty, like soulless eye sockets.

As I got closer, the smell of death grew stronger. In the yard, a man lay near the porch, his face covered in dried blood, flies buzzing around him.

While rummaging through the market, I saw a man lying next to the ATM. He had died there, his card still in hand. Dried blood pooled around him, and the air was thick with the stench of decaying flesh.

I continued along the straight road, the soles of my shoes echoing on the cracked asphalt. The city appeared on the horizon, like all the others. Dead. Silent. The same scene I had memorized by now. As I got closer, I saw the city sign at the entrance, charred, the remnants of the name burned and unrecognizable. The metal was twisted, as if it had passed through hell.

On the streets, thousands of abandoned cars clogged the roads, blocking any chance of passage. Many drivers were still inside, dead, their bodies strapped in by seatbelts. Some had their heads slumped against the steering wheels; others had their eyes open, frozen. I kept walking, the stench of death hanging in the air around me. I passed over a speed bump and saw an old woman lying next to it. Her white hair was tangled, and her skin, dry and pale, seemed almost fused with the concrete. Further ahead, a man lay on the sidewalk, his fingers still outstretched toward his house’s door. Maybe he had tried to go back for something. Maybe he thought he’d be safe inside. It didn’t matter.

The world didn’t end with explosions or anything grand. There wasn’t a meteor tearing across the sky or volcanoes spewing fire. It wasn’t a nuclear war reducing everything to ashes, or electromagnetic pulses wiping out technology. It was just a flu. A flu no one could stop. INF-1, the Red Flu, silent and deadly, erased centuries of civilization in mere weeks.

I looked at the city again—its empty streets, silent homes, stores left open with looted shelves. The world collapsed because of something so small we couldn’t even see it. Just the flu. That was enough to destroy everything we had built.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, announcing the approaching rain, and the wind turned colder. A flash of lightning illuminated the street ahead, revealing more bodies. I saw a small child lying next to a bicycle, a school backpack spilled open behind them. A few steps farther, there was another body—what looked like the child’s mother, arms outstretched, trying to shield her until the very last moment.

Has this happened before? Did another civilization, at some point, fall to something this simple? Thick raindrops began to fall hard, bursting against the asphalt, forming puddles that seemed like distorted mirrors of the sky. The wind howled, sharp and biting, and the thunder punched through the air, making the ground tremble beneath my feet. The city was dead, but it felt like nature itself wanted to remind me there was still power in the world, even if only to destroy what was left. I ran. My steps splashed water in every direction as I searched for any place to take shelter. The cold cut through my skin, and the heavy rain-soaked clothes clung to my body, making every movement harder. I looked around, but everything seemed empty, desolate. Silent buildings, broken windows, abandoned cars forming a useless labyrinth. With each flash of lightning, the scene lit up for a second, revealing details I wished I couldn’t see: corpses scattered in the streets, some half-submerged in puddles, others lying in impossible positions, like ragdolls.

Finally, I spotted a small house with open windows and a door slightly ajar. I ran toward it, ignoring the smell coming from inside. I already knew what I’d find, but I had no choice. I stepped in, pushing the creaking door open, and shut it behind me to block out the wind. Inside, the smell was almost suffocating: mold, decay, and something sickly sweet I couldn’t identify.

The living room was filled with dusty furniture, papers scattered on the floor, and dark stains on the walls. On the couch, a couple sat—or what was left of them. Both had swollen faces and dark patches around their mouths and noses, their hands still clasped together as if they had faced death united. The sight made my stomach twist, but I looked away. I didn’t have the energy to care anymore.

I kept exploring, moving down a narrow hallway. In one of the bedrooms, I found more bodies—children this time. A little girl held a bloodstained teddy bear, and a boy lay beside her, staring blankly at the ceiling. I left quickly. I couldn’t stay in that room another second.

But outside, the rain was an impenetrable wall. Lightning illuminated the broken windows, and the thunder was so loud it felt like it shook the house’s walls. I sat on the kitchen floor, leaning against an old refrigerator, trying to ignore the constant dripping sound from the countless leaks in the ceiling. My stomach growled, and hunger felt like a knife lodged in my body.

I looked around, my eyes adjusting to the dim light. Then, I saw it: the fridge. I crawled to it, my hands trembling from the cold and anxiety. I yanked the door open, and the smell that poured out was almost as bad as the one in the living room—rotten food, spoiled meat, and liquid remnants pooling at the bottom. Even so, I kept searching. Among the empty packages and moldy containers, I found something that felt like a miracle: a can of soup, still sealed.

My fingers gripped the can like it was gold. I checked the expiration date—it was good until next year. I laughed to myself, a dry, strange sound, because who cared about expiration dates now? I took the can and rummaged through the kitchen for something to open it. Finally, I found a rusty can opener.

When I managed to open the can, the smell of the soup wasn’t exactly appetizing, but it was still food. The rain kept pounding outside, but in that moment, with the can of soup in my hands, I felt more human than I had in weeks.

I ate the soup cold, straight from the can. The salty liquid and mushy bits of vegetables filled my empty stomach, and for a moment, the terrible taste didn’t matter. It was warmth in a cold world. It was life in a world of death.

I leaned against the wall, listening as the thunder slowly drifted farther away. Outside, the world was finished, but here, with that empty can by my side, I allowed myself a moment of peace.",1,1737338098.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1i5f8xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i5f8xn/aitah_for_kicking_my_roommate_in_out_over/,AITAH for kicking my roommate in out over thermostat war?,"I live in a suburban neighborhood, the community is very well kept, we have a decent gym, pool and club house with a pole table, computers (printer room) and conference rooms. I had a couple roommates in the last 3yrs. The first took off without notice to live with her bf, the other we constantly were at each others throats cause we could never agree. The last had moved in after I had lived here for over a year. Place is primarily furnished with my belongings and utilities all in my name. Upon meeting this new roommate I was very clear about things that were deal breakers. First I want peacefulness, mindfulness of my dog and respect. If you're quiet we'll get along, if you don't leave food out on tables and clean up after messes so my dog doesn't get sick bonus points and don't disrespect me and we'll get along fine. Things that I didn't want was people coming in going frequently after midnight cause the traffic sends my dog into a frenzy and I work 9-5 but I just want to minimize late night disturbances. Cleanliness is a must, to take care of the things in place as it were their own. Pots, pans and plates are mine and they are free to use them as long as they care for them. I also have a coffee bar, printer and a tv in the living room with Netflix, Hulu, Disney +, Apple TV, Prime, ESPN and Peacock they they may use. My roommate before was known for buying shows without notifying me. Not likely I made a fuss just a random $10 charge was annoying. Then to wait a week for her to Venmo me back. I also provided all the cleaning supplies and toiletries, on top of cleaning every Saturday. Not a big deal to me cause I like to live a certain way so all I ask is that after I clean that they be mindful of making a mess. All this for $1000 a month. Rent is actually 1956 and utilities average 400 a bit more in the summer.
I calculate 800 towards rent and 200 towards utilities. 

Ok to get back on topic. I disclosed all of these things to my roommate. It snowed the other week and I have a schedule for the heat to come on when we're home to be at 70 nd then 68 at night. I still sleep with the window cracked cause I run warm at night. However I noticed I woke up in a sweat in the middle of the night 3 days in a row out of nowhere. I figured it was cause I had turnt it up to 72 before bed and had thrown off the schedule. But the 4th day I sweat so much my bed was moist. Consequently my roommate approachs me to say she had turnt up the heat cause it was ""freezing"" in her room. So I presented the solution of changing the night temperature to 70 and gave her some bedding I had in my closet to provided her extra layers of warmth. She only had but a cheap Walmart set on her bed with no sheets. I helped her setup the layers on her bed. A thick fur throw, one of those Pink winter throws with the fleece on one side and the velvet on the other. Then lastly her standard comfort. For sure I figured with all the layers she'd be warm. I did one better and put the heat at 72 for overnight thinking if anything she might shed a layer off her bed. Opened both windows in my room half way to make sure I was comfortable then went to bed. Then the next day I woke up in a worse sweat! I rush to check the thermostat and it read 76! I opened the balcony to let air out as it was too warm for comfort. For further context I sleep in just my undergarments. If I'm walking around the house in shorts and a tank top in the winter it's way to warm for me. Also the lamp by the thermostat was on and I never leave lights on at night so I went to check the cameras and found my roommate touching the thermostat. I sent her a text that I was uncomfortable with the temperature and was far to warm. She complained once more saying she was freezing so I went to the store and purchased a space heater. 

We had another conversation as this particular went on for a week. That 68 is manageable with the gas to run the heat. However over 72 for overnight will send the gas bill up. She seemed remorseful and she went on her way. Went to peek in her room the following day to see how the space heater was working out and she had put it back in the box by the looks of all the tape around it. 

I got my gas bill and it was $200. We don't cook much I primarily use the air fryer and I always look forward to the winter months cause heat has always been cheaper. 

I'm getting annoyed so I reached out to the electric company to install a smart thermostat. They came the other day and I finally slept a full night. She texted me the next day asking about the code and I left her on read. I feel I did as mush as I could to reasonably accommodate her yet it was enough. I would of suggested her paying the increase portion of the gas but that meant I would still have to sleep in what is too warm for me. 

Then there is the fact that she has had a friend staying over 4 days during the week. I told her that 3 was appropriate once however 3 weeks of her friend staying particularly have the week seemed ridiculous. We had a discussion about it and I told her she had to pay an extra 500 a month for the extra person. That she owed me 500 for the friends current time there. I spoke with the friend as well and she basically took off mid first sentence.

I tried to get Club Mobay for customs but it was sold out, which worked out great because we absolutely breezed through, lol (early Saturday afternoon). Leaving took a bit longer, but I wouldn't say more than 20 minutes. 

Room

* very comfortable queen bed
* spacious enough, we liked having a little table, comfy chairs on balcony
* we liked having the mini-fridge stocked with drinks and a couple of snacks each day
* Our toilet broke the first evening (couldn't flush), they came and fixed it once and then again when it quit working again. When it stopped working consistently the third time, we figured out how to flush it from inside the tank and called it a day. It was annoying, but we were the ones who decided not to call again. 
* the tub plug was also broken, but we didn't call for that 
* the water pressure wasn't great, but it was typical for hotels 
* a/c worked great

Resort

* most of the restaurants and other indoor spaces were overly warm to me, but we were fine eating outside
* beautiful buildings and lush landscaping 
* a fair number of the resort restrooms were pretty raggedy: locks didn't work, leaks in the sink and in the corners of the room, etc. - we did notice they were doing a lot of work, such as painting, landscaping, building a new pagoda, so maybe that's on the list 

Weather

* the weather was amazing, particularly the first several days when it was sunny but not hot, with a great breeze (last couple of days were hotter with bright sun, but not over 82 degrees or so)
* this meant the pools were on the cooler side, which I would absolutely take in exchange for not dying from heat when walking and lounging 
* lots of yellow flags for the water, it got fairly rough, mostly a hindrance to actual swimming (versus me being fine just lolling in the water, lol) 

Food: 

* the coffee at the little coffee shop downstairs at Zilara was disappointing, not too flavorful and the mocha latte was too sweet to drink unless mixed 1:1 with regular
* we discovered later in the week that both the Ziva coffee shop and the buffet had much better coffee; I'd rate it solidly enjoyable but still a bit disappointing 
* lots of great cocktails
* loved the homemade ginger beer 
* it was annoying that you couldn't get early lunch anywhere, even the places that stated 11.30 didn't open till noon 
* the jerk chicken and jerk pork at lunch were huge pieces and huge portions; if you asked for less, they just nodded and gave you a huge plate anyway, lol
* I don't like jerk chicken enough to give a true rating, but the people we were with really liked it 
* if you're used to American pizza, theirs is noticeably undercooked, but their American-style burger was good 
* lots of good soups and stews 
* rather more pumpkin than I've ever seen in food before: in soups, in side dishes, roasted pumpkin, mashed pumpkin (yep, it's a major crop there)
* the Italian restaurant was rated highly by all of us: the lasagna and alfredo were excellent, the pasta with cream sauce and roasted vegetables was very good even though there were no roasted vegetables in sight (julienned carrots and something else, that were still quite crunchy, lol), and the bolognese was excellent and actually the first spicy dish we'd had after several days of eating. 
* same for the French restaurant, with high ratings for the steak, duck, lamb chops, and French onion soup. we ate there twice and got the same things (the menus are all fairly limited), the chocolate dessert we had was really the only dessert we had that was truly as cold as expected the entire week
* the buffet has an abundance of good choices at every meal and is the easiest place to reliably get a green salad 

Staff

* the number of times we were approached with determined timeshare pitches was a definite negative, so much so that I'm actually going to send an email 
* we were a little taken aback at the number of cranky staff members, lol, like I have sullen servers at home, I don't need to go all the way to the Caribbean for them. 
* the regular server at the Zilara coffee shop was comically cranky; when I asked for a pineapple smoothie, she snapped, 'no pineapple, mango!' and my brain immediately went to SNL and 'no coke, pepsi!' 
* the concierge acted like ordering a welcome basket for someone's room was a mysterious request they'd never heard of, even though we saw it on the resort website 
* they definitely seemed understaffed 
* friendly, smiling staff members were definitely the majority

General 

* they didn't have much in the way of free scheduled activities; for example, the cooking demo and the painting class both had an upcharge that was just as much as I'd pay for such a class at home, so kind of a waste to do it there
* the bracelet making 'class' was a few boxes of beads and string, they didn't even set up a table! just the small table that was already poolside - we were going to do this but abandoned ship when we realized how long we'd have to wait to make a cheap bracelet 
* things like aqua fitness classes were definitely running on island time and I'm not patient enough for that, but they did occur 
* beachside yoga classes: good instructor, timely 
* went out on the catamaran and that was great; free non-motorized watersports included catamaran, kayak, boogie board, paddle board, snorkeling
* we did not do excursions, so no comment there 

Zilara vs Ziva

* we stayed at Zilara, the adult side, but found the pools equally enticing 
* we walked over to Ziva to see if the hallways seemed noisy; they did not, but we weren't in the common room for 5 minutes before somebody came in and sat down with a toddler and an iphone - ""baby shark, doo doo doo doo!"" so adult side it is!

Overall a winner, and I'd consider going to an AI again. It was expensive, so I do want to see what else I could do for the same amount of money, but I definitely enjoyed it and relaxed. ",1,1737337810.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

1i5f4v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1i5f4v2/just_the_flu/,JUST THE FLU,"I put on my running shoes with springs, designed to cushion the impact on the ground. It was my nightly ritual, something I did every single day without fail: running to the neighboring town, keeping my body busy and my mind free of thoughts. It was almost five o’clock, and the sun still stubbornly lingered in the sky, painting everything with a pale golden light.

I opened the door and was greeted by a strange smell. A mix of dampness and decay floated in the air, coming from somewhere behind me. The rotting stench made me wrinkle my nose, but I ignored it. I needed to run. I started climbing the hill, the wind against my face. I passed the entrance to the interstate highway, maintaining a steady pace. I was running at about 4 km/h, a moderate speed to warm up. I crossed the rusty sign that read “No Passing” and smirked bitterly.“Who’s going to pass you now?” I murmured to myself, my voice lost in the emptiness of the road. I kept running along the highway, the sound of my shoes hitting the wet asphalt echoing in the silence. When I approached the old brothel, a shiver ran down my spine. The place had been creepy at its best, but now… The sign that once announced the brothel’s name—something vulgar and flashy—lay fallen beside the building, which now resembled a charred carcass. The letters were faded, the wood that had supported the structure blackened and twisted like burned bones, and the windows were nothing but dark, empty holes that seemed to watch me as I passed.

The brothel was near a lake that used to reflect the vibrant, colorful lights of the facade on festive nights. Now, the water was dark, with an oily sheen under the faint light remaining from the day. The shore was littered with debris—broken bottles, pieces of wood that seemed to be parts of the building, and something that looked like a piece of red fabric.

A horrible smell emanated from the area, thicker than the stench of death I had encountered earlier. It was like a mix of rot and burning, as if decay itself had permeated the air. I looked at the entrance and saw that the old double doors, which used to spin open to welcome customers, were fallen, lying wide open on the ground. Inside, everything was in ruins: overturned tables, broken chairs, and what appeared to be dark stains on the floor and walls. Climbing the next hill, I spotted the reservoir of an abandoned property. The silence there was oppressive, broken only by the distant sound of thunder. The old farmhouse loomed like a ghostly shadow in the landscape. The main house was partially collapsed, with loose planks creaking in the wind, and the windows, which had once reflected life within, were now empty, like soulless eye sockets.

As I got closer, the smell of death grew stronger. In the yard, a man lay near the porch, his face covered in dried blood, flies buzzing around him. His glazed-over eyes seemed fixed on a point in the horizon that no longer existed. The ground around him was marked by erratic footprints and dark stains, as if someone had fought to survive there. Some children’s toys were still scattered across the dead lawn, creating a disturbing contrast to the scene of destruction. The trees around swayed in the wind, their branches like thin arms pointing toward the now cloud-covered sky.

In the stable, a few dead animals lay sprawled. The cow, still with blood on its muzzle, seemed to have collapsed recently. The horses lay beside it, their swollen bodies exuding that now all-too-familiar stench of decay. However, amidst this scene of horror, one pig was still alive, wandering among the corpses with hesitant steps, as if searching for a reason to be there. A few chickens pecked at the ground indifferently, their feathers stained with mud and blood. I passed through the fallen fence. Over the next hill, I spotted the reservoir of a place that seemed to have been abandoned long ago. The farmhouse appeared in the distance, shrouded in an ominous gloom. The trees around it, twisted by the wind, cast unsettling shadows over the waterlogged ground. As I got closer, the smell of blood mixed with decay hit my nose like a punch, making the air almost unbreathable.

In the yard of the house, a man lay sprawled, his face marked with dark patches of dried blood. His lifeless eyes stared up at the sky, as if searching for an answer that never came. The wooden porch creaked in the wind, and the door hung from its last nails, swaying slowly like a clock marking the end of time.

I moved forward and passed a truck stuck in the mud. The engine was off, and the vehicle looked as though it had been swallowed by the earth. Inside the cab, a man was slumped over the steering wheel, motionless. The putrid stench emanating from it was suffocating, but I no longer afforded myself the luxury of being bothered. I ran further, my footsteps echoing on the straight road leading me to the next town.

As I passed by a motel, it stood empty. The neon sign, which had likely once flickered incessantly, was dark and covered in soot. On the ground, bodies were scattered: prostitutes lying awkwardly, as if felled by an invisible force. The abandoned cars around the area told another story—a desperate escape, cut short before reaching its destination. The vehicles now came from the opposite direction, as if everyone was fleeing the city I had just left behind. The stench of decay permeated the air, a smell I was beginning to accept as part of my new reality. The sky grew darker, illuminated only by distant lightning. The stars, now almost fully visible, shone over the dead city. There were no more electric lights, no signs of life. A flash of lightning revealed the body of a small child, no older than five, lying next to her mother. They were holding each other, as if trying to protect one another until the very last moment.

Just one month. A single month, and everything was gone. There weren’t many people left now—perhaps no one but me. I thought about it as memories flooded my mind. I remembered school, before everything shut down for good. I thought of my girlfriend, my friends. All dead. Their families, too. Why am I still alive? That question echoes in my head every day. Why me? Why didn’t I die along with them? Along with everyone else? The Red Plague took everything but left me here, alone, wandering through this open-air cemetery.

As I run down this deserted road, my mind keeps revisiting the past, as if to torture me. I remember what the world was like before it all collapsed. Streets full of people, smiles, laughter. I remember going to school, complaining about classes, but secretly enjoying the routine, my friends, the small things that made me feel alive. My girlfriend… I remember her. I remember what it felt like to hold her hand, hear her laugh, feel the warmth of her embrace. Now, all that’s left of her is a memory that cuts like a knife buried deep in my chest.

My friends… Matheus, the one I used to joke around with, watch people at the mall, crack dumb jokes. We laughed like the world could never end. My mother. She died in my arms on the 22nd. That day is etched into me like a scar that will never fade. I held her as she drowned in her own blood, swollen, her eyes red and blind, unable to see me one last time. She tried to say something, but the words got stuck. And then she was gone. I can’t shake the feeling of her body growing cold in my arms.

I remember how happy we were with so little. I remember afternoons at the mall, eating McDonald’s and people-watching, everyone busy with their normal lives. I remember the conversations, the jokes. The sound of children laughing, the music playing in the stores, the smell of coffee and burgers. Now, all of it feels like a distant dream, something that was never real.

I even miss the things I once found annoying. The lines, the traffic jams, the bills. I’d give anything to have a life where those were my biggest concerns again. Now, all I have is silence. A silence broken only by the sound of my own footsteps and the wind carrying the stench of death. It’s as if the whole world is frozen, stuck in a single moment. One month. Just one month, and it was all over. The world, which took centuries to build, collapsed in weeks. And I was left here, to watch it all end.

Heavy clouds rolled above me, dense and full of rain, occasionally lit by lightning streaking across the horizon. The smell of wet earth began to mix with the stench of decomposition, creating a suffocating sensation. The wind howled around me, cold and damp, as if trying to push me away from this place.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, drawing closer, like the footsteps of an invisible giant. When the first drop fell on my face, it was almost a relief, a reminder that the world still had something alive, something not consumed by the plague. The rain came suddenly, strong and relentless, drenching everything within seconds. The lightning illuminated the field around me, revealing a landscape that seemed ripped straight from a nightmare. Bodies were scattered everywhere, lying in random positions, as if the world had frozen at the moment of its greatest tragedy. Some were still in abandoned cars, others sprawled on the ground where death had caught up to them. Water ran over the corpses, washing away dust and blood, but it couldn’t erase the smell. That smell… No matter how much time passed, I knew I’d never forget it.

I kept running, feeling the heavy rain pounding against my clothes and skin, while my thoughts drifted back to things that now seemed impossible. I’d give anything to be home, on a normal day, eating a poorly made burger from some random diner, accompanied by greasy fries. Ice cream… How I miss ice cream. That feeling of cold sweetness melting on your tongue, dripping slowly as you try to savor every second. I’d give anything for ice cream right now. Or even something simpler: a glass of clean, drinkable water straight from the tap. Water that didn’t taste like rust or death.

I wondered what it would be like to sit in my room, playing video games, with the soft glow of the screen lighting up the space. And the internet… I remember how annoyed I used to get when it went out for a few seconds. Now, I’d trade my life to hear that annoying sound of a notification ping on my phone, any sign that the world still existed outside my head.

Electricity was another thing I’d taken for granted. Just turning on a light when entering a room, opening the fridge to find fresh food, or turning on the TV to watch something stupid. All of that had seemed so small before, but now it was an unattainable luxury.

The rain kept falling, heavier and heavier, as I looked up at the sky. Lightning flashed again, and more bodies appeared on the horizon. Children, mothers, men—people who once had dreams and worries just like me. Now they were there, motionless, as if they’d become part of the landscape. Why am I still here?” I asked myself as the water streamed down my face, mixing with the tears I no longer tried to hold back. They called it INF-1, the Beijing Flu, but I like to call it the end of the world. I don’t know exactly how it started. In Germany, it felt like we were safe at first. “The virus is far away,” the newspapers said. “We’re taking all the necessary measures.” Frankfurt Airport. A couple coming from Asia—nothing the government couldn’t control. That’s what they said.

Within days, hospitals began to overflow. It was like an invisible storm sweeping through entire cities. Berlin fell first, like a tree rotted from the roots. Suddenly, the streets were empty, except for ambulance sirens and muffled screams from behind windows. No one wanted to leave their homes, but it didn’t matter. INF-1 didn’t need you to be close to others. It found you anyway.

Bavaria, where I am now, was no different. The flu came like a shadow, silent at first, then brutal. Stores emptied. Schools closed. Train stations became packed with people trying to escape—to where, no one knew. I saw entire families crammed into train cars, coughing, unaware they were carrying death with them.

The virus was relentless. Symptoms started like an ordinary cold: a mild fever, a cough you’d ignore any other time. But within hours, people began drowning in their own blood. I saw my mother die like that. In my arms. Her face swollen, her eyes red, blind, as if her own body had turned against her.

Doctors disappeared first. Some died trying to save others, others simply vanished—maybe fleeing. I don’t blame them. Who could stand against this?

Germany had disaster plans, of course. We always did. Protocols for everything, from terrorist attacks to pandemics. But INF-1 laughed in the face of all of them. There was no way to track something spreading so quickly. No way to stop something that killed before you even knew you were infected. I remember the last time I watched the news. The anchor was a shadow of her former self, coughing between sentences as she read the numbers. “Seventeen million dead in Europe. The government has declared a national state of emergency.” Then the broadcast cut off. It never came back.

Now, Germany is nothing but a corpse. An entire country turned into an open-air graveyard. The cities that once pulsed with life are deserted, filled only with abandoned cars and bodies slumped in the back seats. Houses that once felt like fortresses are now empty, except for signs of struggle—overturned furniture, bloodstains on the walls, locked doors that no one will ever open again.

The smell… That’s the worst. You never get used to it. Decomposition has taken over everything. The air is heavy, as if the very environment is dying alongside the people. I wonder if it’ll ever go away. Maybe not. Maybe that’s INF-1’s final legacy.

I think about who we were before all this. Wealthy people driving luxury cars, living in expensive apartments, making plans for the future. Now, we’re all the same. It doesn’t matter if you were a banker, a teacher, or someone like me. INF-1 didn’t discriminate. It just took. Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg, Berlin. All wiped out. Just the flu. It didn’t need a war. It didn’t need bombs or tanks. All it took was a virus.

I wonder if anyone else survived somewhere. If there are others like me, trying to make sense of why we’re still here. I used to ask myself every day: why didn’t I die with the others? Why didn’t I catch the Red Flu? Why was I the only one who made it through? But you know what? Screw it. The answer doesn’t change anything. I walked to a dusty shelf in a local market and found a forgotten chocolate bar. It was slightly squished, the wrapper worn, but it was still chocolate. I picked it up, unwrapped it slowly, and took a bite, tasting the sweetness, though strange, as if my sense of taste wasn’t the same anymore. While rummaging through the market, I saw a man lying next to the ATM. He had died there, his card still in hand. Dried blood pooled around him, and the air was thick with the stench of decaying flesh.

I continued along the straight road, the soles of my shoes echoing on the cracked asphalt. The city appeared on the horizon, like all the others. Dead. Silent. The same scene I had memorized by now. As I got closer, I saw the city sign at the entrance, charred, the remnants of the name burned and unrecognizable. The metal was twisted, as if it had passed through hell.

On the streets, thousands of abandoned cars clogged the roads, blocking any chance of passage. Many drivers were still inside, dead, their bodies strapped in by seatbelts. Some had their heads slumped against the steering wheels; others had their eyes open, frozen. I kept walking, the stench of death hanging in the air around me. I passed over a speed bump and saw an old woman lying next to it. Her white hair was tangled, and her skin, dry and pale, seemed almost fused with the concrete. Further ahead, a man lay on the sidewalk, his fingers still outstretched toward his house’s door. Maybe he had tried to go back for something. Maybe he thought he’d be safe inside. It didn’t matter.

The world didn’t end with explosions or anything grand. There wasn’t a meteor tearing across the sky or volcanoes spewing fire. It wasn’t a nuclear war reducing everything to ashes, or electromagnetic pulses wiping out technology. It was just a flu. A flu no one could stop. INF-1, the Red Flu, silent and deadly, erased centuries of civilization in mere weeks.

I looked at the city again—its empty streets, silent homes, stores left open with looted shelves. The world collapsed because of something so small we couldn’t even see it. Just the flu. That was enough to destroy everything we had built.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, announcing the approaching rain, and the wind turned colder. A flash of lightning illuminated the street ahead, revealing more bodies. I saw a small child lying next to a bicycle, a school backpack spilled open behind them. A few steps farther, there was another body—what looked like the child’s mother, arms outstretched, trying to shield her until the very last moment.

Has this happened before? Did another civilization, at some point, fall to something this simple? Thick raindrops began to fall hard, bursting against the asphalt, forming puddles that seemed like distorted mirrors of the sky. The wind howled, sharp and biting, and the thunder punched through the air, making the ground tremble beneath my feet. The city was dead, but it felt like nature itself wanted to remind me there was still power in the world, even if only to destroy what was left. I ran. My steps splashed water in every direction as I searched for any place to take shelter. The cold cut through my skin, and the heavy rain-soaked clothes clung to my body, making every movement harder. I looked around, but everything seemed empty, desolate. Silent buildings, broken windows, abandoned cars forming a useless labyrinth. With each flash of lightning, the scene lit up for a second, revealing details I wished I couldn’t see: corpses scattered in the streets, some half-submerged in puddles, others lying in impossible positions, like ragdolls.

Finally, I spotted a small house with open windows and a door slightly ajar. I ran toward it, ignoring the smell coming from inside. I already knew what I’d find, but I had no choice. I stepped in, pushing the creaking door open, and shut it behind me to block out the wind. Inside, the smell was almost suffocating: mold, decay, and something sickly sweet I couldn’t identify.

The living room was filled with dusty furniture, papers scattered on the floor, and dark stains on the walls. On the couch, a couple sat—or what was left of them. Both had swollen faces and dark patches around their mouths and noses, their hands still clasped together as if they had faced death united. The sight made my stomach twist, but I looked away. I didn’t have the energy to care anymore.

I kept exploring, moving down a narrow hallway. In one of the bedrooms, I found more bodies—children this time. A little girl held a bloodstained teddy bear, and a boy lay beside her, staring blankly at the ceiling. I left quickly. I couldn’t stay in that room another second.

But outside, the rain was an impenetrable wall. Lightning illuminated the broken windows, and the thunder was so loud it felt like it shook the house’s walls. I sat on the kitchen floor, leaning against an old refrigerator, trying to ignore the constant dripping sound from the countless leaks in the ceiling. My stomach growled, and hunger felt like a knife lodged in my body.

I looked around, my eyes adjusting to the dim light. Then, I saw it: the fridge. I crawled to it, my hands trembling from the cold and anxiety. I yanked the door open, and the smell that poured out was almost as bad as the one in the living room—rotten food, spoiled meat, and liquid remnants pooling at the bottom. Even so, I kept searching. Among the empty packages and moldy containers, I found something that felt like a miracle: a can of soup, still sealed.

My fingers gripped the can like it was gold. I checked the expiration date—it was good until next year. I laughed to myself, a dry, strange sound, because who cared about expiration dates now? I took the can and rummaged through the kitchen for something to open it. Finally, I found a rusty can opener.

When I managed to open the can, the smell of the soup wasn’t exactly appetizing, but it was still food. The rain kept pounding outside, but in that moment, with the can of soup in my hands, I felt more human than I had in weeks.

I ate the soup cold, straight from the can. The salty liquid and mushy bits of vegetables filled my empty stomach, and for a moment, the terrible taste didn’t matter. It was warmth in a cold world. It was life in a world of death.

I leaned against the wall, listening as the thunder slowly drifted farther away. Outside, the world was finished, but here, with that empty can by my side, I allowed myself a moment of peace.",1,1737337596.0,Odd_directions,1,0.67,False

1i5f42p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1i5f42p/new_to_nespresso_and_confused_with_different_pods/,New to Nespresso and confused with different pods,"Hi,

I just ordered my first Nespresso Vertuo pop machine with aeroccino and I'm very excited.

I have been watching YouTube videos and reading many pages here and the website to understand the different pods to try to figure out what to order but I'm still unsure.

So, my goal is to drink hot latte or iced coffee or iced latte.

1. I read that I should get milk recipe pods or double espresso pods for lattes. So for example, I can get Double espresso chiaro 80ml vs bianco forte that's 230ml. But does this mean that I will be making a small latte with chiaro and a large latte with Bianco Forte? do I still put the same amount of steamed milk or do I put less with Bianco Forte? 

2. If I want regular iced coffee experience (iced americano) should I get the pods for 230ml(7.7oz)? Does this mean that these pods are meant to be more diluted compared to espresso, double espresso, lungo pods? Can I still achieve the same by brewing an espresso or double espresso and adding cold water? (Sorry if this offends coffee connoisseurs 😅 I'm not very coffee savvy nor picky hahha)

3. Can I make the coffee in any mugs? I see Nespresso advertising their barista prep cups and tempered glass mugs and stuff but I just normally use regular mugs for my coffee (coming from keurig). This is ok right? The glasses are just so you can see the coffee from the side?

4. Iced drink option give half the brew than indicated. Is this to account for the ice melting? 

5. I'm just overall really confused about the size. I come from keurig where, if I want 6oz, I put 6oz of water, if I want 10oz, I put 10oz of water. But with Nespresso, it seems like there's specific amount of drink coming out for each pod. If I want to always drink, say 230ml of coffee, should I just grab those pods only? Or can I grab lungo or double espresso and add hot water to it? I guess I'm confused as to whether 230ml one is just as strong as double espresso or lungo or if it's supposed to be more watered down version of it?

6. If I go to a boutique, would I be able to try any coffee before buying the sleeve? Or is it just so that I don't have to wait for shipping?

Thank you!",3,1737337527.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False
1i5f3yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1i5f3yo/experience_with_treating_methanedominant_sibo/,Experience with & treating methane-dominant SIBO,"Hey y'all. I just wanted to share my experience because it's been so helpful reading about others' experiences on here and on TikTok. I had never heard of SIBO until I was diagnosed by a functional medicine doctor, and while it was upsetting, it was so relieving to have an answer to what was going on with me. Thanks for sharing your journeys so I had something to relate to during this process.

**Backstory & symptoms**   
I've had stomach issues my whole life but things really took a turn for the worse in 2012 when I had my first experience of pancreatitis. I've had chronic pancreatitis since then, never sure what would trigger it or when it would come. I've been hospitalized and gone to gastroenterologists, but nothing ever gave me any clarity, so I stopped seeking out help for it. When I'd get it, I'd just drink a shit ton of peppermint tea and drink a liquid diet after things died down. It always puzzled doctors because people prone to pancreatitis are typically older men with high cholesterol/alcoholism, whereas I'm a young woman who's been vegan this whole time (so not eating any cholesterol) and have had pancreatitis even during months of not drinking alcohol. Triggers weren't consistent - the first time it was an orange, once it was a really spicy curry, once it was a beer, but then I'd have those things again with no problems. 

The last time I had it, despite not going to the hospital for it anymore, I almost did go because of how badly it hurt. What was frustrating was that I had a day of totally normal foods that I eat all the time. All my meals were made at home. For dinner, I had oatmeal with protein powder and banana. I woke up with such immense pain in my upper abdomen, and for the first time I also experienced this extreme heart burn where I couldn't speak and it hurt to breathe. I took some peppermint MyLanta and that helped. But it really spooked me. My mom brought it up to our chiropractor and he suggested I meet with a functional medicine doctor, which I had never heard of, so I made an appointment right away. 

**Diagnosis**  
Meeting with the functional medicine doctor was such an unlock for me. He asked me all the questions I would have thought other doctors would ask me, like my lifestyle, how I ate, any other chronic issues I was having, etc. He gave me an abdominal exam, which no one had ever done before. When I told him the year I got my first pancreatic attack was the same year I traveled to India, his eyebrows raised. I guess SIBO can be caused by bad food poisoning, which i definitely had upon returning to America after being in India for a month. He had me do a breath test, stool test, and get some blood work done. Tests showed normal hormone and vitamin levels, I didn't have parasites, apparently my body hates gluten (which was news to me) and it showed the highest levels of SIBO he's ever seen. I guess methane is supposed to be like, 12 parts per million in the gut and mine was 100+. He had actually had SIBO before so it was great to have his guidance during this process. He let me know the options and at the time, the elemental diet was not something I thought I could mentally do so we went with the herbal supplements. 

**Treatment: herbal supplements & elemental diet**  
The first day I took the supplements I felt \*terrible\*. Pretty nauseous and had to lie down for a nap. I was so worried this was how the next few months were going to be. Luckily, that was the worst day of it. I did have brain fog, a slight headache, and extreme fatigue during this time but it was manageable. It was encouraging to know these were die-off symptoms, so even though I felt off, it felt like something was working. I also did a low FODMAP diet for about a month and that indicated to me that I didn't do well with garlic and onions, and I experienced way few stomach aches since removing them from my diet. I can still have garlic, just not super garlicy things.

Anyway, that was the situation for twoish months, then I met with him again and since I had still been experiencing somewhat regular bloating, he suggested I do another round of them and added an additional supplement to the regimen. Even though I was still getting bloating, I can't stress enough how much better I felt because for the last year, I had been getting bloated and pain after pretty much every single meal. Now it was mostly at night, so I also tried to not eat after six and that did make a difference. When I added the fourth supplement to my regimen, everything was AMAZING. I pretty much felt like I could eat anything without any pain. I felt less die-off symptoms. I was avoiding gluten. I honestly felt great. He was like awesome, let's retest then and you can stop the supplements when you run out. 

A couple months later, I went a little too hard with feeling invincible and really overdid it with food. I was very stressed and used food as a comfort, and thought I could get away with overeating/eating processed foods at restaurants a lot, and some of my symptoms came back. I retested and it showed a vast improvement but that I still had SIBO. That made sense to me, since it had been so high to begin with and that I was being a little careless with my gut health. I think the ""parts per million"" were in the 30s? So he said I could do another round of supplements or the elemental diet. At this point, I had had months to consider the elemental diet, and I felt a little less emotionally dependent on food than I once had (although now I'm like, was it the bacteria telling me to eat all the time? lol) so I said, let's just do the elemental diet and see what comes of it. 

Gosh, this is getting long. I feel like I could write a whole thing about this experience. Here's what I'll say:  
\- It is challenging and at times a little sad but if you go into it with an intention and a mantra, it can really help. I told myself this was two weeks out of my life vs. over a decade of stomach issues.   
\- You will have less serotonin and less energy, so it's nice to plant some little boosts of serotonin where you can, whether that being seeing friends, being in the sun, watching a favorite tv show, etc.   
\- I simply could not consume the recommended amount per day. I think I found a hack later in this process that would have helped me earlier on, but I've only had about 900-1200 calories a day. So I fall asleep at like 8pm, I'm not working out or even going for walks really, I've dropped a pant size.   
\- The hack that helps: Blend the powder with water and ice. I was just mixing it in, and it'd get really globby and not disperse evenly, which would gross me out and make me too nauseous to finish the drink. I'm on day 13 right now and actually consuming more shakes because of blending it all up  
\- I thought I was doing well with the oral hygiene aspect but I wasn't doing good enough at the back of my tongue. Make sure you brush and tongue scrape back there, and when you use mouth wash, gargle for 30 seconds. I was able to lower the oral thrush by using baking soda and warm water but it definitely freaked me out for a day to see the build up back there  
\- I WOULD NOT TO THE ELEMENTAL DIET AS THE FIRST COURSE OF ACTION IN YOUR TREATMENT JOURNEY unless your SIBO levels are only a little over a normal amount. While it is the most effective treatment, it definitely would not have gotten my levels down enough to have been encouraging. I'm glad I made progress with the supplements first and then did this to finish it off. Even if it doesn't get rid of it all, I'm fine doing the supplements again for a little longer.   
\- I'm confused by people doing the elemental diet along with any food. From what I understand, the whole point is to starve the bacteria, which isn't happening if you're still eating any other food. I have not consumed \*anything\*, not gum, not anything, besides a little peppermint tea and coffee one day. Just stick to it even though it sucks   
\- The only symptom I had was a slight burning feeling in my stomach. It was there but it's not too bad, I think it mostly happens when I drink it too fast, since you're supposed to sip on it slowly over the course of an hour.  
\- You will not go #2 and that's normal. Your digestive system is on a total break. About half way through, I did have one bowel movement but it must have been stuff left over in my system. 

Well, that was a book. It's been a journey! Down to answer any questions. I just wanted to share in case it's helpful, because I was in the dark for so long. I'll post an update when i do a breath test in a week or so. All of this stuff is extremely expensive and health insurance doesn't cover it, so it really sucks, but if you can, I highly recommend seeing a functional medicine doctor or reading blogs by them or something to get guidance because this all can be confusing and quite emotional.

It was my nightly ritual, something I did every single day without fail: running to the neighboring town, keeping my body busy and my mind free of thoughts. It was almost five o’clock, and the sun still stubbornly lingered in the sky, painting everything with a pale golden light.

I opened the door and was greeted by a strange smell. A mix of dampness and decay floated in the air, coming from somewhere behind me. The rotting stench made me wrinkle my nose, but I ignored it. I needed to run. I started climbing the hill, the wind against my face. I passed the entrance to the interstate highway, maintaining a steady pace. I was running at about 4 km/h, a moderate speed to warm up. I crossed the rusty sign that read “No Passing” and smirked bitterly.“Who’s going to pass you now?” I murmured to myself, my voice lost in the emptiness of the road. I kept running along the highway, the sound of my shoes hitting the wet asphalt echoing in the silence. When I approached the old brothel, a shiver ran down my spine. The place had been creepy at its best, but now… The sign that once announced the brothel’s name—something vulgar and flashy—lay fallen beside the building, which now resembled a charred carcass. The letters were faded, the wood that had supported the structure blackened and twisted like burned bones, and the windows were nothing but dark, empty holes that seemed to watch me as I passed.

The brothel was near a lake that used to reflect the vibrant, colorful lights of the facade on festive nights. Now, the water was dark, with an oily sheen under the faint light remaining from the day. The shore was littered with debris—broken bottles, pieces of wood that seemed to be parts of the building, and something that looked like a piece of red fabric.

A horrible smell emanated from the area, thicker than the stench of death I had encountered earlier. It was like a mix of rot and burning, as if decay itself had permeated the air. I looked at the entrance and saw that the old double doors, which used to spin open to welcome customers, were fallen, lying wide open on the ground. Inside, everything was in ruins: overturned tables, broken chairs, and what appeared to be dark stains on the floor and walls. Climbing the next hill, I spotted the reservoir of an abandoned property. The silence there was oppressive, broken only by the distant sound of thunder. The old farmhouse loomed like a ghostly shadow in the landscape. The main house was partially collapsed, with loose planks creaking in the wind, and the windows, which had once reflected life within, were now empty, like soulless eye sockets.

As I got closer, the smell of death grew stronger. In the yard, a man lay near the porch, his face covered in dried blood, flies buzzing around him. His glazed-over eyes seemed fixed on a point in the horizon that no longer existed. The ground around him was marked by erratic footprints and dark stains, as if someone had fought to survive there. Some children’s toys were still scattered across the dead lawn, creating a disturbing contrast to the scene of destruction. The trees around swayed in the wind, their branches like thin arms pointing toward the now cloud-covered sky.

In the stable, a few dead animals lay sprawled. The cow, still with blood on its muzzle, seemed to have collapsed recently. The horses lay beside it, their swollen bodies exuding that now all-too-familiar stench of decay. However, amidst this scene of horror, one pig was still alive, wandering among the corpses with hesitant steps, as if searching for a reason to be there. A few chickens pecked at the ground indifferently, their feathers stained with mud and blood. I passed through the fallen fence. Over the next hill, I spotted the reservoir of a place that seemed to have been abandoned long ago. The farmhouse appeared in the distance, shrouded in an ominous gloom. The trees around it, twisted by the wind, cast unsettling shadows over the waterlogged ground. As I got closer, the smell of blood mixed with decay hit my nose like a punch, making the air almost unbreathable.

In the yard of the house, a man lay sprawled, his face marked with dark patches of dried blood. His lifeless eyes stared up at the sky, as if searching for an answer that never came. The wooden porch creaked in the wind, and the door hung from its last nails, swaying slowly like a clock marking the end of time.

I moved forward and passed a truck stuck in the mud. The engine was off, and the vehicle looked as though it had been swallowed by the earth. Inside the cab, a man was slumped over the steering wheel, motionless. The putrid stench emanating from it was suffocating, but I no longer afforded myself the luxury of being bothered. I ran further, my footsteps echoing on the straight road leading me to the next town.

As I passed by a motel, it stood empty. The neon sign, which had likely once flickered incessantly, was dark and covered in soot. On the ground, bodies were scattered: prostitutes lying awkwardly, as if felled by an invisible force. The abandoned cars around the area told another story—a desperate escape, cut short before reaching its destination. The vehicles now came from the opposite direction, as if everyone was fleeing the city I had just left behind. The stench of decay permeated the air, a smell I was beginning to accept as part of my new reality. The sky grew darker, illuminated only by distant lightning. The stars, now almost fully visible, shone over the dead city. There were no more electric lights, no signs of life. A flash of lightning revealed the body of a small child, no older than five, lying next to her mother. They were holding each other, as if trying to protect one another until the very last moment.

Just one month. A single month, and everything was gone. There weren’t many people left now—perhaps no one but me. I thought about it as memories flooded my mind. I remembered school, before everything shut down for good. I thought of my girlfriend, my friends. All dead. Their families, too. Why am I still alive? That question echoes in my head every day. Why me? Why didn’t I die along with them? Along with everyone else? The Red Plague took everything but left me here, alone, wandering through this open-air cemetery.

As I run down this deserted road, my mind keeps revisiting the past, as if to torture me. I remember what the world was like before it all collapsed. Streets full of people, smiles, laughter. I remember going to school, complaining about classes, but secretly enjoying the routine, my friends, the small things that made me feel alive. My girlfriend… I remember her. I remember what it felt like to hold her hand, hear her laugh, feel the warmth of her embrace. Now, all that’s left of her is a memory that cuts like a knife buried deep in my chest.

My friends… Matheus, the one I used to joke around with, watch people at the mall, crack dumb jokes. We laughed like the world could never end. My mother. She died in my arms on the 22nd. That day is etched into me like a scar that will never fade. I held her as she drowned in her own blood, swollen, her eyes red and blind, unable to see me one last time. She tried to say something, but the words got stuck. And then she was gone. I can’t shake the feeling of her body growing cold in my arms.

I remember how happy we were with so little. I remember afternoons at the mall, eating McDonald’s and people-watching, everyone busy with their normal lives. I remember the conversations, the jokes. The sound of children laughing, the music playing in the stores, the smell of coffee and burgers. Now, all of it feels like a distant dream, something that was never real.

I even miss the things I once found annoying. The lines, the traffic jams, the bills. I’d give anything to have a life where those were my biggest concerns again. Now, all I have is silence. A silence broken only by the sound of my own footsteps and the wind carrying the stench of death. It’s as if the whole world is frozen, stuck in a single moment. One month. Just one month, and it was all over. The world, which took centuries to build, collapsed in weeks. And I was left here, to watch it all end.

Heavy clouds rolled above me, dense and full of rain, occasionally lit by lightning streaking across the horizon. The smell of wet earth began to mix with the stench of decomposition, creating a suffocating sensation. The wind howled around me, cold and damp, as if trying to push me away from this place.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, drawing closer, like the footsteps of an invisible giant. When the first drop fell on my face, it was almost a relief, a reminder that the world still had something alive, something not consumed by the plague. The rain came suddenly, strong and relentless, drenching everything within seconds. The lightning illuminated the field around me, revealing a landscape that seemed ripped straight from a nightmare. Bodies were scattered everywhere, lying in random positions, as if the world had frozen at the moment of its greatest tragedy. Some were still in abandoned cars, others sprawled on the ground where death had caught up to them. Water ran over the corpses, washing away dust and blood, but it couldn’t erase the smell. That smell… No matter how much time passed, I knew I’d never forget it.

I kept running, feeling the heavy rain pounding against my clothes and skin, while my thoughts drifted back to things that now seemed impossible. I’d give anything to be home, on a normal day, eating a poorly made burger from some random diner, accompanied by greasy fries. Ice cream… How I miss ice cream. That feeling of cold sweetness melting on your tongue, dripping slowly as you try to savor every second. I’d give anything for ice cream right now. Or even something simpler: a glass of clean, drinkable water straight from the tap. Water that didn’t taste like rust or death.

I wondered what it would be like to sit in my room, playing video games, with the soft glow of the screen lighting up the space. And the internet… I remember how annoyed I used to get when it went out for a few seconds. Now, I’d trade my life to hear that annoying sound of a notification ping on my phone, any sign that the world still existed outside my head.

Electricity was another thing I’d taken for granted. Just turning on a light when entering a room, opening the fridge to find fresh food, or turning on the TV to watch something stupid. All of that had seemed so small before, but now it was an unattainable luxury.

The rain kept falling, heavier and heavier, as I looked up at the sky. Lightning flashed again, and more bodies appeared on the horizon. Children, mothers, men—people who once had dreams and worries just like me. Now they were there, motionless, as if they’d become part of the landscape. Why am I still here?” I asked myself as the water streamed down my face, mixing with the tears I no longer tried to hold back. They called it INF-1, the Beijing Flu, but I like to call it the end of the world. I don’t know exactly how it started. In Germany, it felt like we were safe at first. “The virus is far away,” the newspapers said. “We’re taking all the necessary measures.” Frankfurt Airport. A couple coming from Asia—nothing the government couldn’t control. That’s what they said.

Within days, hospitals began to overflow. It was like an invisible storm sweeping through entire cities. Berlin fell first, like a tree rotted from the roots. Suddenly, the streets were empty, except for ambulance sirens and muffled screams from behind windows. No one wanted to leave their homes, but it didn’t matter. INF-1 didn’t need you to be close to others. It found you anyway.

Bavaria, where I am now, was no different. The flu came like a shadow, silent at first, then brutal. Stores emptied. Schools closed. Train stations became packed with people trying to escape—to where, no one knew. I saw entire families crammed into train cars, coughing, unaware they were carrying death with them.

The virus was relentless. Symptoms started like an ordinary cold: a mild fever, a cough you’d ignore any other time. But within hours, people began drowning in their own blood. I saw my mother die like that. In my arms. Her face swollen, her eyes red, blind, as if her own body had turned against her.

Doctors disappeared first. Some died trying to save others, others simply vanished—maybe fleeing. I don’t blame them. Who could stand against this?

Germany had disaster plans, of course. We always did. Protocols for everything, from terrorist attacks to pandemics. But INF-1 laughed in the face of all of them. There was no way to track something spreading so quickly. No way to stop something that killed before you even knew you were infected. I remember the last time I watched the news. The anchor was a shadow of her former self, coughing between sentences as she read the numbers. “Seventeen million dead in Europe. The government has declared a national state of emergency.” Then the broadcast cut off. It never came back.

Now, Germany is nothing but a corpse. An entire country turned into an open-air graveyard. The cities that once pulsed with life are deserted, filled only with abandoned cars and bodies slumped in the back seats. Houses that once felt like fortresses are now empty, except for signs of struggle—overturned furniture, bloodstains on the walls, locked doors that no one will ever open again.

The smell… That’s the worst. You never get used to it. Decomposition has taken over everything. The air is heavy, as if the very environment is dying alongside the people. I wonder if it’ll ever go away. Maybe not. Maybe that’s INF-1’s final legacy.

I think about who we were before all this. Wealthy people driving luxury cars, living in expensive apartments, making plans for the future. Now, we’re all the same. It doesn’t matter if you were a banker, a teacher, or someone like me. INF-1 didn’t discriminate. It just took. Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg, Berlin. All wiped out. Just the flu. It didn’t need a war. It didn’t need bombs or tanks. All it took was a virus.

I wonder if anyone else survived somewhere. If there are others like me, trying to make sense of why we’re still here. I used to ask myself every day: why didn’t I die with the others? Why didn’t I catch the Red Flu? Why was I the only one who made it through? But you know what? Screw it. The answer doesn’t change anything. I walked to a dusty shelf in a local market and found a forgotten chocolate bar. It was slightly squished, the wrapper worn, but it was still chocolate. I picked it up, unwrapped it slowly, and took a bite, tasting the sweetness, though strange, as if my sense of taste wasn’t the same anymore. While rummaging through the market, I saw a man lying next to the ATM. He had died there, his card still in hand. Dried blood pooled around him, and the air was thick with the stench of decaying flesh.

I continued along the straight road, the soles of my shoes echoing on the cracked asphalt. The city appeared on the horizon, like all the others. Dead. Silent. The same scene I had memorized by now. As I got closer, I saw the city sign at the entrance, charred, the remnants of the name burned and unrecognizable. The metal was twisted, as if it had passed through hell.

On the streets, thousands of abandoned cars clogged the roads, blocking any chance of passage. Many drivers were still inside, dead, their bodies strapped in by seatbelts. Some had their heads slumped against the steering wheels; others had their eyes open, frozen. I kept walking, the stench of death hanging in the air around me. I passed over a speed bump and saw an old woman lying next to it. Her white hair was tangled, and her skin, dry and pale, seemed almost fused with the concrete. Further ahead, a man lay on the sidewalk, his fingers still outstretched toward his house’s door. Maybe he had tried to go back for something. Maybe he thought he’d be safe inside. It didn’t matter.

The world didn’t end with explosions or anything grand. There wasn’t a meteor tearing across the sky or volcanoes spewing fire. It wasn’t a nuclear war reducing everything to ashes, or electromagnetic pulses wiping out technology. It was just a flu. A flu no one could stop. INF-1, the Red Flu, silent and deadly, erased centuries of civilization in mere weeks.

I looked at the city again—its empty streets, silent homes, stores left open with looted shelves. The world collapsed because of something so small we couldn’t even see it. Just the flu. That was enough to destroy everything we had built.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, announcing the approaching rain, and the wind turned colder. A flash of lightning illuminated the street ahead, revealing more bodies. I saw a small child lying next to a bicycle, a school backpack spilled open behind them. A few steps farther, there was another body—what looked like the child’s mother, arms outstretched, trying to shield her until the very last moment.

Has this happened before? Did another civilization, at some point, fall to something this simple? Thick raindrops began to fall hard, bursting against the asphalt, forming puddles that seemed like distorted mirrors of the sky. The wind howled, sharp and biting, and the thunder punched through the air, making the ground tremble beneath my feet. The city was dead, but it felt like nature itself wanted to remind me there was still power in the world, even if only to destroy what was left. I ran. My steps splashed water in every direction as I searched for any place to take shelter. The cold cut through my skin, and the heavy rain-soaked clothes clung to my body, making every movement harder. I looked around, but everything seemed empty, desolate. Silent buildings, broken windows, abandoned cars forming a useless labyrinth. With each flash of lightning, the scene lit up for a second, revealing details I wished I couldn’t see: corpses scattered in the streets, some half-submerged in puddles, others lying in impossible positions, like ragdolls.

Finally, I spotted a small house with open windows and a door slightly ajar. I ran toward it, ignoring the smell coming from inside. I already knew what I’d find, but I had no choice. I stepped in, pushing the creaking door open, and shut it behind me to block out the wind. Inside, the smell was almost suffocating: mold, decay, and something sickly sweet I couldn’t identify.

The living room was filled with dusty furniture, papers scattered on the floor, and dark stains on the walls. On the couch, a couple sat—or what was left of them. Both had swollen faces and dark patches around their mouths and noses, their hands still clasped together as if they had faced death united. The sight made my stomach twist, but I looked away. I didn’t have the energy to care anymore.

I kept exploring, moving down a narrow hallway. In one of the bedrooms, I found more bodies—children this time. A little girl held a bloodstained teddy bear, and a boy lay beside her, staring blankly at the ceiling. I left quickly. I couldn’t stay in that room another second.

But outside, the rain was an impenetrable wall. Lightning illuminated the broken windows, and the thunder was so loud it felt like it shook the house’s walls. I sat on the kitchen floor, leaning against an old refrigerator, trying to ignore the constant dripping sound from the countless leaks in the ceiling. My stomach growled, and hunger felt like a knife lodged in my body.

I looked around, my eyes adjusting to the dim light. Then, I saw it: the fridge. I crawled to it, my hands trembling from the cold and anxiety. I yanked the door open, and the smell that poured out was almost as bad as the one in the living room—rotten food, spoiled meat, and liquid remnants pooling at the bottom. Even so, I kept searching. Among the empty packages and moldy containers, I found something that felt like a miracle: a can of soup, still sealed.

My fingers gripped the can like it was gold. I checked the expiration date—it was good until next year. I laughed to myself, a dry, strange sound, because who cared about expiration dates now? I took the can and rummaged through the kitchen for something to open it. Finally, I found a rusty can opener.

When I managed to open the can, the smell of the soup wasn’t exactly appetizing, but it was still food. The rain kept pounding outside, but in that moment, with the can of soup in my hands, I felt more human than I had in weeks.

I ate the soup cold, straight from the can. The salty liquid and mushy bits of vegetables filled my empty stomach, and for a moment, the terrible taste didn’t matter. It was warmth in a cold world. It was life in a world of death.

I leaned against the wall, listening as the thunder slowly drifted farther away. Outside, the world was finished, but here, with that empty can by my side, I allowed myself a moment of peace.",0,1737337352.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,0.5,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I'm still friends with 2/3 of them, but it's not the same. We were a terrible match for each other. They were the only people I cared about, and they felt the same. I was so fucked up and in my head all the time. I actively tried to make my mental and physical health worse and worse and to this day I have never wanted to get better. I have only ever had a motivation to get worse. They constantly made fun of how I look and made me feel out of place and uncomfortable by making me feel unfunny, and I loved my life, and wanted it to end all at once. I hated myself, but I loved that feeling. I've never gotten a break from the flashbacks of walking down cold dark streets lit warmly by neighbouring houses, and hiding my crying at a sleepover simultaneously with the one I don't talk to after we just spoke about how long we had left. I hate the fact that I was wrong about it being months, and I love that feeling. I just want us back. I left because it was the right thing to do and my mental health steadily got better after i did, but I hated that. Now that I've dropped again, all I can think of is getting worse, and I feel so lonely not having them to get worse with. The ones I'm still friends with aren't the same. They don't treat me as they used to. And I know nothing about the one I cut off. I hate my clean and tidy room. I just want back the broken glass weaved into my carpet fibres, the carelessly blood soaked sheets, and the same shorts and t-shirt for the third month in a row. I miss relying on coffee to keep me awake, and the painfully empty stomach to keep me thinking. I miss when I had the carelessness i did back then. Where I didn't care who found out what I did to myself the night before. In fact, I hoped they would. Nowadays, I'm just sad. I'm just deflated and looking for some way for my boredom to end without being overworked. I hate being healty, that's never changed, but now I don't have people to agree with me.

1i5f0ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoMorocco/comments/1i5f0ux/learning_arabic_through_immersion_in_morocco/,Learning Arabic through Immersion in Morocco.,"## Learning Arabic through Immersion in Morocco: A Beginner's Guide

Dreaming of mastering Arabic while exploring the vibrant culture of Morocco?  Immersion is the key, and Morocco is the perfect classroom! This guide will help you navigate the adventure of learning Arabic in Morocco, from preparation to practical tips.

**Why Choose Morocco for Arabic Immersion?**

Morocco offers a unique blend of accessibility and authenticity.  Unlike some Arabic-speaking countries, Morocco is relatively easy to navigate for beginners, with widespread tourism infrastructure. Yet, the Arabic language is deeply woven into daily life, providing ample opportunities for practice.  You’ll hear Darija (Moroccan Arabic) everywhere – in markets, cafes, and on the streets – creating a natural learning environment.  You'll also encounter Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in more formal settings.

**Before You Go: Laying the Foundation**

While complete fluency before arriving isn't necessary, some groundwork will enhance your experience:

* **Basic Arabic Phrases:** Learning greetings (""Assalamu alaykum,"" ""marhaba""), thank you (""shukran""), and essential phrases for getting around will immediately boost your confidence.  Apps like Duolingo and Memrise are great starting points.
* **Understanding the Script:** Familiarize yourself with the Arabic alphabet. While not essential initially, recognizing letters will make navigating signs and menus easier.
* **Choose Your Location:**  Marrakech offers bustling markets and a vibrant atmosphere ideal for immersion, but smaller cities like Fes or Chefchaouen might offer a more relaxed pace for learning.

**During Your Immersion: Making the Most of Your Time**

* **Language Exchange:** Connect with Moroccans!  Many are eager to practice their English and help you with Arabic.  Meetups, language exchange apps (HelloTalk, Tandem), or even striking up conversations in cafes are excellent options.
* **Formal Classes:**  Consider enrolling in a language school or taking private lessons.  Structured learning complements informal immersion, providing a solid grammatical foundation.
* **Embrace Mistakes:** Don't be afraid to make mistakes!  Moroccans are generally patient and appreciative of your efforts.  Every incorrect pronunciation is a learning opportunity.
* **Immerse Yourself in Daily Life:** Shop at local markets, eat at traditional restaurants, and engage in everyday conversations.  Even ordering coffee can be a valuable learning experience.
* **Utilize Resources:**  Carry a phrasebook, download a translation app (Google Translate is helpful, but don't rely on it solely), and consider purchasing a beginner's Arabic textbook.
* **Be Patient and Persistent:** Learning a new language takes time and dedication.  Celebrate small victories and don't get discouraged by setbacks.


**Beyond the Classroom: Cultural Immersion**

Learning Arabic in Morocco goes beyond grammar and vocabulary.  Immerse yourself in the rich culture:

* **Explore the Souks:**  The bustling markets are a sensory feast, providing ample opportunity for practice and cultural immersion.
* **Attend Traditional Events:** Experience Moroccan music, dance, and festivals for a deeper cultural understanding.
* **Learn about Moroccan Cuisine:**  Cooking classes are a fun way to learn about the country's culinary traditions and practice your Arabic with the instructor.


**A Note on Darija vs. MSA:**

You'll primarily encounter Darija, the colloquial Moroccan Arabic.  While it's not standardized, mastering Darija is invaluable for everyday communication.  MSA, the formal Arabic, will be useful for formal settings and broader understanding of the Arabic world.  Ideally, your immersion will expose you to both.


Learning Arabic through immersion in Morocco is a rewarding journey. Embrace the challenges, celebrate the successes, and prepare for an unforgettable adventure filled with both linguistic and cultural discoveries.  Happy learning!

Without this game/software or whatever these kind of things are called, I wouldn't even considered the idea of googling and randomly find what a Kindle is.

100 Classic Book Collection is exactly what the title says, and I love this weird little thing. The aesthetic of a bookshelf (all of the books are public domain with no modern editing), the two pages at once, it even has sounds for page turning, bookmarks and background music (things like beach, rain, coffee shop and more). Literally the only downside of this program, at least for me, are the microscopic screens and the little amount of words they can fit. 
My stupid brain would love to have this in modern hardware, or some sort of UI that mimics it, lol yeah it won't be happening any time soon. 
This has to be the worst way to read anything btw 🤣 but still has some charm that makes me keep it around lol, even now that I do have a kindle and use it constantly. ",34,1737337241.0,kindle,4,1.0,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I (37F) started dating Robert (27M) a couple of months ago. It all began as just fun since I’ve always believed that for a relationship to work, the man should be older than the woman. The idea of taking him seriously never even crossed my mind.

I manage a busy 24/7 coffeehouse, and one typical Friday night, I was about to call the police on a group of rowdy, drunk young men. Suddenly, a muscular redhead wearing a gun on his belt stepped in and, with just a few firm looks, had them out the door. That scene definitely triggered some primal instincts. At that time, I had also decided it was time to re-enter the dating world after taking a year-long break to focus on myself following a tough breakup. I put on some makeup that night, went back out, and resolved to have fun again.

I’ve always been an independent woman. I moved to the other side of the world on my own at 18 with just three suitcases and $100, and I’ve built a good life for myself. My focus has always been on my career, with the goal of achieving financial independence before settling down and starting a family. I also look much younger than my age, thanks to sunscreen, genetics, a little Botox, and constantly being on my feet at work. Because of this, younger guys often hit on me, assuming I’m their age.

Robert is sweet and has a sharp, spicy sense of humor that doesn’t sit well with people obsessed with political correctness. He moved here on his own at the same age I did, so we bonded over the similar challenges we faced in early adulthood. He enlisted in the army and has done very well, as he’s part of an elite unit. He’s highly motivated, intelligent, and the type of guy you just know is going places. He’s also the kind of person who would help a 90-year-old granny carry her bags up the stairs, make her laugh with a flirty joke, and leave her blushing.

After texting for a few days and grabbing coffee a couple of times, I found myself wondering why someone like him, who could have any woman he wanted, was pursuing me—a woman 10 years older. After ruling out stupidity or mental illness, I decided to just enjoy what felt like a gift from the universe.

The physical connection was mind-blowing (as you’d expect from a 27-year-old—yay!), and we quickly began spending more time together. What surprised me was how well-read and mature he turned out to be—more so than many older men I’ve dated. We had deep, meaningful conversations in between the physical connection, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying his company on multiple levels. I stopped overthinking and let myself live in the moment.

As time went on, we began spending almost all our free time together. We never explicitly labeled our relationship but naturally fell into being a couple. We created this little honeymoon bubble where we disconnected from the world and just enjoyed each other’s company, sleeping together almost every night.

Now, two months in, we’re ridiculously happy. We’re the kind of couple I would’ve rolled my eyes at three months ago if I’d seen them on the street. I’ve never felt so safe, supported, appreciated, and loved for who I truly am. He’s a breath of fresh air and the best warm embrace. For the first time, I don’t even crave my alone time anymore. He’s seamlessly integrated into my life, and I’ve never been happier.

But two nights ago, we were talking about his future plans, and I asked where he saw himself in 10 years. As he painted this detailed picture of his goals, I realized that starting a family wasn’t anywhere on his horizon. That’s when it hit me: of course, he’s only 27. It makes sense that he’s not thinking about that right now.

I didn’t let the thought linger and told him directly that his vision didn’t include something I won’t be able to provide in 10 years—children. He had previously mentioned wanting a big family, including both biological and adopted kids. To make that happen, we’d need to start very soon.

The pink bubble burst, and for the first time, we acknowledged that we might have an expiration date. We had a calm, mature conversation. He admitted that he’d already considered this and that, while he’d love to have kids with me, he’s not ready—financially or career-wise. He also doesn’t want to take away the opportunity for me to experience motherhood in the way I’ve always envisioned.

His reaction was deeply moving. Seeing his heartbreak made me realize just how special what we have is. We decided not to rush to a decision but to take some time to think things through. He left on a work trip this morning, so I have time to process everything.

I know the logical choice is to end things now to avoid getting more attached and facing an even harder breakup later. We could both find partners who align with our life stages. But we feel such a deep sense of loss at the thought of ending things that I can’t help but wonder: Should I give this a chance and see where it leads, or rip the Band-Aid off now to save myself from a deeper heartbreak?

TLDR: we fell for each other but the age difference and the children timing is problematic so I wonder if I should leave all sentiment aside and move on or give it a chance. ",0,1737336803.0,relationships,5,0.38,False

I hear a voice in the dark. Deep, but gentle. 

“Good. You’re waking up.” 

The light stabs my eyes when I try to open them. I shut them again.

“I was worried you never would. I know they say you shouldn’t move people involved in a crash, but I couldn’t leave you in that car like that. We’d both freeze or become snowmen. I mean, snow people.” 

I open my eyes again. The light filters in. I see the shape of a man, but he’s out of focus. I lift my hand up to touch him, but he pushes it back down with his fingertips. 

“Don’t move,” he says. “Take it easy.” 

I hear him, but I want to see his face. He’s still blurry. I open my mouth and hope the words I want to say come out the way I want to say them. 

“I need my glasses.”

“Oh. Right,” he says. “They're over here.” 

I watch as the blurry man reaches to his right. I don’t turn my neck out of fear that it’s broken, even though I know it’s unlikely. My neck feels fine. My head feels like someone used it like a bass drum for hours.

The blurry man hands me my glasses. I put them on and I see an older man with a shock of messy brown hair. His beard is uncombed with gray streaks. He also has glasses. If the situation were different, I’d make a joke. I’d tell him he looked like Paul Bunyan with a 401K. But I don’t say it. 

“Where am I?” I ask him instead. 

He smiles. I feel at ease in his presence. He feels like an old friend, despite the circumstances.

“You’re at my home. My name is Josh.” 

I tell him that my name is Liz. I try to remember how I ended up in his home. My head is killing me, but I fight through it as best as I can. Fragments play in my mind. They’re fuzzy at first, like static on an old-school TV set, but are getting clearer with every passing second.

“Can you sit up?” Josh asks. I can and I do. 

I look around. We’re in a basement. No windows. But it’s cozy. I’m sitting on a couch. There’s a TV nearby and a coffee table, and a heater attached to the wall. It also doesn’t smell like a basement. He must spend a lot of time down here. 

“Are you hungry?” Josh asks. 

I nod my head. I have questions, but figure they can wait. 

“I’ll run upstairs and fix you something real quick. You can turn the TV on. It only gets a couple of channels. Those ones that play reruns of old sitcoms all day, you know?”

Josh stands up. He’s tall and wide. He could pick me up and toss me like a javelin if he wanted, so the last thing I need to do is piss him off.

I have no reason to believe he would, but I don’t want to find out. 

“And if you need it, there’s a bathroom right over there.” 

He points. I look over my shoulder to see what he’s talking about. I thank him and do my best to smile, despite my headache. 

I watch Josh as he walks to the stairs, climbs them, and shuts the door behind him.

**II**

I remember turning on my car radio before the crash.

I like to drive in silence. No music, no podcasts, just me and my thoughts. It’s the cheapest form of therapy there is, and I say this as someone who goes to therapy once a month. My friends think it’s weird. They look at me like I’m as deviant as some people I’ve written about. I don’t care. It’s just the way I like to do things. 

Now that I think about it, I remember a couple of other things, too. 

I remember turning on the radio because of the snow. It came down hard and wouldn’t stop until it got dark outside. I hate snow. I turned on the radio because I didn’t want to listen to the sound of it crunching underneath the tires as I made my way down the long and winding county road ahead of me.

I shouldn’t have driven that day, but I had to chase a lead. When I say “had to,” I mean I acted on an impulse. My therapist encourages me to do that less, but what she doesn’t know won’t hurt her. 

I remember my GPS telling me to continue on the county road for another three miles. I turned the radio down and dictated a text to my editor, letting him know where I was going. He wouldn’t like that I was going out to the sticks on my own in a snowstorm, but I knew he’d forget all about it once I turned in my story. He always did. 

After sending the message, I turned the radio back up. Some top-40 pop song played. I don’t remember which one. It got harder to see the road ahead of me. The snow and wind erased everything in the distance. All I saw was white. A blank canvas for my imagination. 

I thought about my destination ahead—what it looked like on the inside and out, and what I would say to the person who lived there. I needed to gain his or her trust in a short amount of time. They’d either grant me an interview, tell me to leave, or worse.

I’ve written plenty about times when “worse” happened to other people. Was I afraid it could happen to me? Sure. But that’s the job sometimes. 

I’d been thinking about a spiel to give the homeowner that would explain why I was standing at their doorstep on a snowy December day, asking about a disappearance that went cold long before I was born. I recited it to myself, making sure it was just right.

I saw the deer right as I started the last sentence of my rehearsed explanation. I swerved. 

Then the lights went out.

**III**

Josh and I are eating sandwiches on the couch. Ham and cheese. I don’t like ham, but I eat the sandwich, anyway. I don’t want to offend Josh. He saved my life, after all.

Josh breaks the silence first.

“I called the ambulance, so you know. It’ll take a while for them to get here because of the snow. I guess I could have tried driving you to the hospital. I’ve got a pickup truck. It’s a hand-me-down, though. I was worried we’d both end up in a ditch if I risked it.”

“I understand.”

“Take this opinion with a grain of salt, but I think you’re going to be alright. Based on the way your car looked, I thought you were a goner. It’s a miracle.”

I shudder at the thought. I assure myself that I won’t make the same mistake again. Not even for a story.

“Thank you for this,” I say to Josh. “Thank you for everything.”

Josh smiles without showing his teeth. “Of course. I couldn’t leave you there. I’m glad I passed through at the right time. On a normal day, I’d be at work right about now. It’s almost like serendipity in a way.”

I nod. Josh is more interested in finding meaning in coincidence than I am.

“Can I ask you a question?” he says. “Where were you headed?”

“I was looking for the Riley farm.”

Josh’s eyes light up with recognition.

“You know of it?”

“We all know about the Riley farm around here,” he says. “What’s your business there?”

“I’m working on a magazine story about Amelia Gill.”

Josh shakes his head. “I mean no disrespect when I say this, but why go around digging up old bones? That girl’s been gone for years. We’ve all moved on.”

“But her family hasn’t.”

“You’ve spoken to them?”

“I have. They’re adamant that someone at that farm knows what happened to their daughter. The least I can do is offer them a chance to share their side of the story.”

Josh sighs. “I guess. I don’t agree, but I guess we’ll leave it at that.”

“Fine by me.”

“Isn’t it nice when people can disagree and it doesn’t get blown out of proportion? It’s a rarity these days, if you ask me.”

I raise an eyebrow at that last statement. Josh picks up on it.

“What’s wrong?” he asks.

“Nothing. I feel like I’ve had this conversation before. Déjà vu, I guess.”

“I know what you mean. It’s hard to keep track of time out here. Feels like the days blur together.”

He laughs. I don’t. I feel around my pockets for my cell phone. It’s not there.

“Where’s my phone?”

“I found it covered in snow. I put it in rice to absorb the moisture.”

“I need to call Arthur. He’s my editor. I want to let him know I’m okay. He gets worried.”

“I’ll check and see how it’s doing when I take these plates back upstairs.”

“I’ll come with you. That way, you don’t have to make multiple trips.”

“I’d prefer if you didn’t,” Josh says. “My house is a mess. I wasn’t expecting company.”

“Oh. Sure.”

Josh takes my plate, stacks it on top of his, and stands up. “Be back in a flash,” he says before heading back upstairs. I jump at the sound of the door slamming shut behind him.

A black hole forms in my stomach. Something is not right. I consider the possibility that I could be overreacting to the actions of a shy man.

But I fear it could be something else.

**IV**

Fifteen minutes pass. Josh hasn’t come back downstairs. My head no longer hurts, but my mind is racing with every intrusive thought my subconscious can muster. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he got tied up doing with something with his job—whatever it is. But then I remember him saying that he didn’t have to work because of the snow.

I need to know for sure. I decide to act on my impulses. Sorry in advance to my therapist.

I get off the couch and walk toward the stairs. For as bad as Josh made the wreck sound, it is a miracle that I’m not more banged up than I am. I can’t just sit there on the couch in a cloud of uncertainty. I somehow escaped death. I’m not ready to go yet.

The stairs lead to a brown wooden door at the top of the landing. I climb them one at a time while taking deep breaths to remain calm. My brow is moist. I wipe it with the back of my left hand. When I reach the landing, I put my right hand on the doorknob and hesitate.

I listen for any noise on the other side of the door. It’s quiet. Just the way I like it.

I turn the doorknob and push the door open, bracing myself for the worst. But nothing happens. My muscles relax, but I’m not comfortable yet. I take two steps past the door frame and into the house proper, looking both ways before going further.

The basement door is in the kitchen, which is small, but put together. No buckets of blood or dismembered body parts caught my eye. But what about the rest of the house?

I walk through the kitchen and into the main hallway. The hardwood groans underneath my feet with each step I take. There are no pictures or decorations, just bare walls that seem familiar. Déjà vu prickles at my neck again. There’s a draft passing through. I wish I had my coat. Summer can’t come fast enough.

The hallway takes me to the living room. An old sofa and love seat in mint condition from the 70s takes up the most space up front. There’s no TV or bookshelf, or anything else for Josh to entertain himself with. He leads a lonely life in the middle of nowhere. I don’t envy him. In fact, I wonder how he hasn’t gone insane by now.

The draft nips at me again. I shiver and rub my hands against my forearms to warm them up. The cold air is coming in from the right. I walk in that direction and stop at the sight of my reflection in a mirror on the wall.

There’s a scar on my face, running diagonally from my left eye to my right cheek. I’ve never seen this before. Or have I? I don’t know anymore. It couldn’t have come from the crash. It wouldn’t have healed that fast. Nothing makes sense. I want to scream, but I hold it in my throat. However, I can’t stop the tears from coming.

My chest is tightening. I need to breathe.

I follow the cold air. It leads me to the side door, which is ajar. I brace myself for the frigid weather and yank it open. I close my eyes and breathe as the cold air envelops me. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. When I open my eyes, I see something in the distance.

There’s a well a few feet away from the house. Beyond that, there’s rolling acres of snow-covered farmland that stretch far beyond my eyes. I can’t help but fixate on the well. It looks like any other well, made of stone with a gabled wooden roof above the opening. There’s a small weathervane fixed on the roof. It’s shaped like a whale. I’ve seen plenty of weathervanes shaped like roosters and other birds in my life. A whale is a first for me.

At least I believe it is. The more I think about it, the more I realize the well seems familiar, too. Have I been here before? There are so many holes in my memory that I can’t patch. Everything goes back to the moments before the crash—in the car listening to the radio.

I feel a soft touch on my left shoulder. I turn my head to the right and see Josh’s meat cleaver of a hand. I feel a sharp pinch on the right side of my neck and cover it with my hand. When I turn around, I see Josh standing in front of me with a syringe.

“What did you do?” I ask him.

“Just gave you something to help you relax. You’ve had a long day, after all. If you have questions, I suggest you get them out now.”

“What do you mean?”

Josh chuckles. “I’m the man you’ve been looking for. Josh Riley.”

My eyes narrow as I study him from top-to-bottom. “This is the Riley farm?”

“That’s right. Come. Have a seat.”

He guides me into the living room. I feel my energy slipping away with every step. We sit on opposite sides of the sofa.

“What do you want to know? Act fast, the sedative is strong.”

I’ve got so many questions, but ask him the one that I’d been practicing for days.

“Did you kill Amelia Gill?”

“Yes.”

“Where’s her body?”

Josh gestures toward the side door. “Out there. In the well. It runs deep.”

My racing heart is slowing down. I feel myself slipping.

“Why are you telling me this? Don’t you know what I do for a living?”

“Because you’ll forget all about it when you wake up.”

“What?”

“I’m no doctor, but I think you bumped your head pretty hard in the crash. Whenever you fall asleep, your brain resets itself. I lost count of how many times we’ve had this exact conversation. You always find out. You always forget. I can tell you anything, and I know my secrets will be safe with you.”

My heavy breathing is slowing down, too, as a fog spreads in my brain. My eyelids are getting heavy. I’m losing strength. My will to fight is verging on empty.

“How long?”

“How long what?” Josh says.

“How long have I been here?”

“It’ll be one year next week.”

“But … but what about my family? What about Arthur, my editor? He knew I was—”

“They already came looking for you. They think you’re long gone.”

“You’re a monster.” I lean back against the sofa. I’m sinking into the cushioning. I’m so comfortable, I could sleep. I decide to use my last bit of energy to ask one last question. “Why are you doing this to me?”

Josh smiles, this time showing his teeth. His grin is almost too wide to be human. This is who he really is.

“It makes me feel like I’m in control,” he says. “It’s also nice having a woman’s presence around here. Hasn’t been the same without Amelia. You’ll meet her someday. I’m not ready for that yet. You think your story brought you out here? I think we were meant to find each other. The snowstorm, the crash—it’s all serendipity, Liz. Don’t you see?”

I hear him talking, but I don’t understand his words. It’s just noise. My hatred of him becomes dull. I feel nothing. I try to cling on to whatever memories I can. Anything that will help me save myself. Because no one else will.

I close my eyes. Everything goes black.

Somewhere in the void, I remember turning on the car radio and listening to a top-40 pop song I can’t name.

A deep and gentle voice brings me out of it.

Do our differences make us incompatible or is there a way to navigate the relationship that makes us both happy?,"My girlfriend (F20) and I (M22) have been dating for 2 years. She is still in college while I have graduated and started working a corporate job. We have been in a LDR for 5 months, but will be back together in June.

I, since I can remember, have only cared about three groups of people: my family, my closest friends (seven guys I’ve known since college), and my girlfriend. I do not care about anyone else that I interact with or talk to. A good way to describe it is that I often base my interactions with people on how useful or important they are to me. For example, I run into the VP or manager while grabbing a coffee in the kitchen and pretend to be genuine and caring because it’s more advantageous to me. I have a great memory and often bring up something they’ve talked about before.

Versus, I see a homeless guy on the side of the street, a guy on the side of the road asking me for help, or someone my girlfriend is getting coffee with—I do not care about any of these people. I never go out of my way to hurt any of these people. Based on what my friends and close ones say about me, I am very charming, charismatic, and a great showman. Yet, all of it is complete bullshit. It’s all disingenuous. Not comparing myself to Homelander here, but the way he switches off as soon as he’s done talking to someone he doesn’t care for describes me to a T.

My detachment from others is a key factor in my success. I don’t boast or seek to impress others unnecessarily, though I recognize there are moments when it’s strategic to highlight accomplishments. My lived experiences, achievements, and performance on intelligence and emotional aptitude tests suggest that I operate at a level above the average. That said, I don’t consider myself the smartest person in the room—I have my flaws and strive for self-improvement every day.

From a Nietzschean perspective, my ability to thrive stems from my natural talents combined with my will to power. I take pride in understanding what to say, when to say it, and how to project emotions (or the appearance of them) to influence situations in a way that maximizes outcomes for myself. I carefully calculate consequences and feel little remorse for my actions, as my priorities revolve around myself and the three groups that truly matter to me. At times, I view people as tools to achieve my goals. In short, I would describe myself as a narcissistic Machiavellian.

Regarding friends and meeting new people, I really only vibe with people who are somewhat rough and rugged. My friends and I make inappropriate jokes, cuss, are involved with internet culture (not 4chan, lol), pregame, go out, and have fun, and they are genuinely the only people I can be authentic around (besides my family and girlfriend). At the end of the day, we all take care of our girlfriends, our families, and each other. I am really proud of the friends I have and would be comfortable letting someone like my sister date them. I do not care about anyone else who is like this.

My girlfriend, on the other hand, has characteristics that clash with mine:

She wants to help others as much as she can in whatever situation she is in. She is compassionate towards others, strives to be authentic with everyone, and is incredibly community-based (especially at church). The reason why I love her, though, is because she’s incredibly hardworking, determined to succeed in whatever she does, adventurous and not afraid to live life in the fast lane, dark-humored and kinky, and when we work together towards something, we make an incredibly good team.

The only part I don’t really like and have a hard time coming to terms with is that she is altruistic towards random people. I don’t like when she asks me to help the old lady get the groceries in her car, give a granola bar from the glovebox to a homeless guy, or help a stranger on the side of the road. But if I saw someone who broke their leg in the forest and I was the only person around, I would help them if I had adequate defenses. If she asks me to meet a couple that she wants to be friends with at church, I smile and act presentable on the outside but find them insufferable on the inside; I can’t wait to leave.

All this to say, she has values that rank towards the top of her list that I don’t like, and I don’t think she likes the values I put on top of my list. Everything else seems to be okay. Like I said, when everything is good between us, we are a POWER couple. I love her so much and spend so much time, money, and emotional energy on her. I believe I treat her well.

But as a naturally selfish person, it grinds my gears and makes me upset a little when she wants to help others and I don’t. I am really having a hard time giving up a little bit of myself that has made me successful and a force to be reckoned with in the past. I feel like it goes against my identity.

Question for people that might have had this dynamic, or have dealt with possible NPD or non-empathetic people before: 

How can I navigate this relationship without completely changing who I am, or forcing her to change who she is? Do our personalities spell disaster long-term? What are some ways that you would navigate this situation to foster a successful relationship that could lead to a successful marriage?

TLDR:

I only care about my family, close friends, and girlfriend—everyone else is just a tool or irrelevant to me. My detachment and ability to manipulate situations to my advantage have made me successful in business and in social situations, but I don’t feel bad about it. My girlfriend, on the other hand, is overly compassionate and always wants to help anybody that she's around, which irritates me. Despite our differences, I love her and think we make a great team when we’re on the same page. I’m struggling to balance our clashing values without changing who I am or forcing her to change, and I’m trying to figure out if this relationship can ",1,1737336680.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I found out three days before Christmas, and told my husband the following day. He was pleased as punch... myself, excited but more than a little nervous. Big mixed bag of feelings. For this and other reasons, I asked my husband if we could keep the news between us for a while and let me process/adjust to this new reality before sharing with our family/friends.

His response... ""I'm so excited - can I just tell Work Friend?"" 

I repeated that I would prefer to keep it between us for now, at least to get through the holidays without all the focus on us. 

Fewer than ten minutes later he says ""Work Friend is super happy for us! And I told Other Friend, she says congratulations.""

I let him know I was disappointed and I thought his behavior was super disrespectful and shitty, but whatever, it's out of my hands now. He assured me that he wasn't going to tell anyone else. 

Fast forward through the weeks following Christmas, during which he pestered and pressured me to tell his family members before I was ready. Again, we had his parents casually over for coffee one night and he ""let it slip"" without my consent because he's ""just so excited"". 

Repeat this process with a few other friends and family members. 

For whatever reason, he hasn't yet ""let it slip"" to his paternal grandparents. Because of this, his dad has been pressuring him to call them. Today, his dad gave him an ultimatum: he would say something before the end of the day if my husband didn't. 

Husband comes home in a super disagreeable mood and proceeds to vent to me about his dad's total lack of consideration and how angry he is over this ultimatum. I calmly listen to him, and I agree, it's not a nice thing to do. It's not his dad's news to share. It IS inconsiderate. But this is where maybe I'm the asshole - ""I love you, but does this maybe give you some context for how it felt when you did the same thing to me?""

He then gets even angrier and tells me that it's not the same situation at all, criticizes me for making it about myself, says I have a victim mindset, he just needs support from me and not ""whatever this is"". 

I then also blew up at him, defending myself, and we've hardly spoken for the rest of the night. 

I can't wrap my head around him wanting sympathy from me after repeatedly hurting me with almost the same behavior.

but is it not the same situation? Is he right? Should I have put my own resentment aside to help him feel better? DID I selfishly make it about me? Maybe he would have made the connection without me pointing it out, or maybe he would have been more receptive if I just gave him a hug and let him calm down for a while.

Let me start by saying I’m somewhere on the aromantic spectrum, technically bi, (though I prefer considering myself queer) and somewhat neutral about physical stuff. So I’m looking  for long-term connection, friendship and companionship in forms outside of “typical” relationships. 

Something like a queer platonic relationship or non romantic partner is my ideal. Though absolutely open to close friendships as well. Preferably with other ace/queer person.

To explain a bit more- I simply don’t desire romantic intimacy or romantic relationships and I don’t feel romantic love. Though I like the idea of it, and understand it on an intellectual level, I’ve tried to force romantic relationships to fit in but to it feels fake. Like playing pretend. 

However I do desire companionship, and interpersonal relationships. I’m very drawn to sharing experiences and intellectual connections, and I do experience platonic and familial love and I can enjoy physical relationships. 

Probably also important to note that I do want a kid in the near-ish future. I’m exploring single motherhood options, but am also open to the possibility of finding someone to share all/part of that experience with. 

At this point I’m not really focused on location or age (just be over 21). Aesthetic attraction is kinda important to me. No smokers, no hard drugs, no heavy drinkers. Kid friendly, dog friendly. Personality, shared interests and values are important. Also probably important to mention I live in a rural town in Colorado with  no immediate plans to change that. 

More about me- Gemini, INTJ, ADHD, very pragmatic, free spirited and independent. I value knowledge, curiosity and honesty. Travel is my biggest passion with 42 countries visited so far. I’m nerdy in a pop culture sort of way (MCU, HP, Star Wars) and I adore going to Disney theme parks. I’m into witchy things like tarot and crystals. I like to write, read and craft. I deal with some social anxiety, I hate small talk and settings where Im supposed to socialise with  people I “sort of” know. Though being anonymous in a crowd doesn’t bother me at all. I like bookstores, coffee shops, museums or going to the movies. I rarely drink, dont smoke or do drugs. Technically Christian but not practicing. Politically left. I’m white, reddish hair, blue eyes, short and slim/average build.

So, there’s the gambit. I know there’s others out there like me. Just finding something so likeminded can be tricky! But here’s to hoping.

### Training
Background: Mid-20s male, played soccer growing up but became very sedentary going into college, only recently got back into regular exercise. Started running February of last year. 

I tried getting into running several times over the last few years but it usually only lasted at most a month before I would get overuse injuries, usually shin splints. I did a 10K last April which was my first race ever, ran it in 57min but came out of it with horrible shin splints. Saw a PT and corrected my form enough to not get injured and kept running. I then went right into Hal Higdon HM Novice 1 and completed all of it except the HM because it was the middle of summer in Texas.

Come September I had signed up for a Half Marathon (today) and a full marathon a month from now (February 16). I started the full marathon Novice 2 plan but it was feeling too intense and I was ramping too much.

I pivoted to using Garmin Coach (HR based) for the full marathon and setting this half as a supporting event. Focused on keeping HR down. Been feeling like the volume with Garmin Coach hasn't ramped up enough for the full marathon but felt good for the half.

In December I went on vacation and then got very sick coming home so I missed two full weeks of training. Picked it right back up and recovered well, also went plant based in the last month which has helped with energy levels and recovery times. My soreness is way down.

### Pre-race
Going into the race I felt good, little worried about training volume but overall felt confident in my half. Garmin Coach hasn't given me any runs over 6-7ish miles for my long runs (especially with the HR limitations) so I was worried about running basically double the length of any of my long runs since July. Slept bad last night but woke up and felt good with some coffee and overnight oats.

### Race
Huge cold front came through last night so the race was ~28 degrees F when it started, only warmed up a degree or two over the time of the race. Felt strong starting out, started getting bad cramps around mile 9 but stopped for extra water and felt better. 

I fueled at 45min, 1:15, and 1:45 with fruit snacks. Stopped at every other water station for water.

I pushed myself hard through the entire race, was hopeful about hitting a 2:00hr race but wasn't able to push that hard. I was at maximum effort through the race, pace was mostly consistent until some big hills in the last couple miles absolutely crushed me. The entire last 5K my legs were screaming to stop but was able to push to the end.

Felt good about my race especially with it being only my second race of any kind ever. I've been feeling really bad about my pace, especially Zone 2, which is usually 11-12min but feeling really good about my 9:30ish pace today. It's definitely a good signal that Zone 2 training and Garmin Coach (HR based) works, at least for me.

### Post-race
Post race, I'm feeling really sore and tired but proud of myself. Definitely humbled by 13.1 so I'm a bit scared of 26.2 next month but I'm gonna give it my best and definitely just take that one way slower, probably target 11:30min/mi pace.

1i5ej00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1i5ej00/lost_our_soul_dog_suddenly_feeling_inconsolable/,"Lost our soul dog suddenly, feeling inconsolable ","We lost our sweet boy of 9 years in a very sudden & traumatic way yesterday and I just feel like I need to just word vomit the entire experience out of grief so just bear with me. My fiancé and I had a routine with him when we would wake up. He’d get us out of bed and we’d go in the living room and play for a little bit before coffee and breakfast. He was doing a little play dig in the carpet like he usually does and he let out a noise, not really a yelp, but a cry and his limbs stiffened up and he collapsed. We both rushed over and held him, confused and concerned thinking it was a seizure, telling him it’s okay and I held his head. He let out a strained breath and I watched the light leave his eyes and his head went limp in my lap and he released his bowels. I immediately got up to get out the door and he carried him in the car, got him to the vet within 5 minutes, but the lifesaving measures they gave weren’t enough.

We’re at a complete loss. He was so healthy, so active. He had just gone to the vet the day prior and received vaccines (waiting on those copies of records, just to make sure everything was correctly administered or if maybe there was a correlation of some sort, not anti-vax or anything like that, but the coincidence is there and I don’t want anyone else to go through this if it’s preventable). The likely scenario is that he had a blood clot, brain aneurysm or something neurological we could have never anticipated or diagnosed beforehand. He was an extension of us, he got us through our 20s, he was so special and pure, winning over the hearts of everyone he met, our little shadow and velcro dog. Everything around us is him. The imprint still on his bed, his fur on the ground, his toys scattered around, the water still in his bowl. It’s extremely jarring and makes me sick to my stomach when I come home and he’s not here, I feel like I’ve cried at least once an hour for 2 days straight and I feel like my heart is physically in pieces. Its comforting in some ways that he passed without pain and had us both holding him as he passed…but to see him happy, playing with us and then gone within seconds is excruciatingly hard to accept and wrap my head around. I’m taking the emotions as they come, but I just can’t get a grip on the time we’ve lost with him, the years we know he had left, he was so healthy and we were always so careful with him and made sure he was in the best condition he could be in. It just feels awful we could have done everything right and still get this awful, unfair outcome and lose a precious piece of our life. I know he was getting older, but I never thought we’d lose him in such a traumatic way, so quickly, without even preparing for it. I feel like it would’ve been different if we watched him grow older and could at least digest the fact the day was coming but this…almost makes me inconsolable. If anyone else has been through something similar, please feel free to share your experience, i will take any and all advice to help with the grieving process.",9,1737335699.0,Petloss,2,1.0,False

Night. Between 1:30am and 5am. I have adhd and a full time job so have a very strict night routine in order to function. Lights out, in bed at 10. Asleep by 11. Alarm at 8:30am. I never drink alcohol or coffee. I don't eat 2-3 hours before bed. I have a relatively good diet (no fast food, no greasy foods at all. Fruit and veggies daily. I'm working on upping protein). I am medicated for my adhd, but I take it in the early morning and I notice it wear off in the afternoon so I highly doubt that's a cause.

My whole life I've had insomnia where it's hard to fall asleep, it would take hourssssss to fall asleep and some nights I didn't sleep at all. After medicating and getting therapy for my adhd, it was like magic and I could keep a night routine and sleep so well. Until a year and a half ago when this started. I wake up at a stupid early hour, sometimes I can fall back asleep within 20 minutes but sometimes I'm awake for hours. Sometimes I'm awake until my alarm goes off and I'm ridiculously fatigued the whole day.

Thoughts about s1 stuff after the s2 premiere ,"Been going back through the first season with a fine tooth comb for anything that might allude to things we now know about Lumon. And I just want to get a few things out there. I'm sure a lot of this had been mentioned but I'm new here and felt like this was too much for a comment. My apologies if this has all been stated to death at this point. 

1. The figure in the hallway in S2E1 has to be Mark IMO it's a symptom of reintegration after rewatching Petey scenes I'm convinced of this. (Might be wrong but hey I agree with everyone saying Mark is reintegrating, Helly is actually Helena, Irv knows not to trust at least Helly and Dylan timeline is fishy with all those clocks. The clocks feel really important)

2. In S1E2 Dylan makes a comment about how the department used to have a 5% completion rate for files before Mark's freshman fluke. He also mentioned that files don't keep for that long when Helly wonders why it's not 100% all the time. So we can infer that Mark is an extremely good refiner, maybe the best in the company. It seems fair to infer that Lumon would want their best refiner back at work. We can tell that this is a big deal because the new refiners seen in S2E1 mention that they never hit quota not even once. Mark brought about very productive quarters since he was hired. This is notable. Maybe Dylan became more productive when Mark joined MDR. 

3. In S1E3 In perpetuity, we see Mark retreat upstairs from helping Petey get settled and he watches a news segment. It's a ""debate"" between Natalie and someone representing anti severance views. The important claim is that a woman (not a Lumon worker but a severed worker at a different company) discovered that she was pregnant. And Outie discovered that their Innie was having sexual experiences. Natalie wants to focus on the use of the words workie and insie sweeping the claim under the rug as false. The worker refuses to even identify herself. That seems like a legitimate request considering the accusation is extremely disturbing. But as the season goes on we learn about the waffle party and the very sexual nature of it. Milkshake even tells Dylan in the finale that the Tempers would be disappointed and that he could still go back. Pair that with the weird lines hidden in the newspaper from S2E1 include ""sexual liberations"" included with new snacks in the reforms mentioned in the paper. Remember Milkshake said there was ""stuff you don't even know about"" to Dylan too. Coffee cosie etc but who really knows what else there could be. Very very odd. Is it safe to say now that Lumon is absolutely forcing or enticing severed employees to sexually gratify other  severed employees as perks/rewards and  maybe even as punishments? To what end? I have no idea but that news story really sticks out to me now. I mean what other companies use severance? I thought it was Lumon tech alone... 

3. There was a brief mention in S1E2 I think by the lady member of the Whole Mind Collective when Mark is drunk and harassing them. She says that Jame Eagen wants to Sever Children before Mark cuts her off. Ms Huang appears to be a Child. And jury is still out on if she's a ""full time employee"" that's using the severed tech in some way like Ms. Casey. Milkshake says that he isn't a severed man so it would be logical that Ms Huang isn't severed either, but we can't trust Milkshake. And maybe theyre just permanently Innies and thus are unsevered. Her former job as a crossing guard is noteworthy. Did she help kids cross streets or something else like the sound of radar red herring gag? How long has she been employed if it was just her first day as that supervisor role?

4. Petey was nervous to mention anything in front of Irv who he believes to be a snitch. Innie Irv has big snitch energy early on.  And we have seen as much from Irv calling for a manager and ratting on Mark after he admitting hiding the team photos. Innie irv has been a company man for a long time. He's been reset at least once, 9 years employed but believes it's only 3 and the testing floor elevator haunting his outie. Very funny to have seen the gradual shift in Irv and learn he's easily the most active anti severance outie of all of them balls deep in his own investigation. But management is completely unconcerned about him during the OTC scene. Helly and Dylan are the only concerns for obvious reasons. Bur still he gets no mention while the others are all named.

5. Another thought here not inspired by season one but by the paper shown in S2E1 has 3 articles and the one about the home robbery reads clear as day to be that oIrv reporting a break in when he got back home. Obviously not remembering what iIrv had done. If it wasn't Irv  reporting it the whole thing still plays out to me like Outties that report a crime committed by their Innie. They're ""professionals"" and leave no trace? It's their innie. Just like the Irv scenario. If not that it's gotta be related to one of the Functions from S1 Beehive, Clean Slate, Elephant, Freeze Frame, Goldfish, Glasglow, Lullaby, Open House, Overtime. I might be missing one but it would be relatively easy to make a severed person rob themselves and the Outtie would never know. All the crimes would appear to be done by a prolific burglar. I like this idea but it needs fleshing out.

6. Refiners have 5 bins. Each bin has one of the Four Tempers in it to fill. Knowing now that these very clearly correlate to someone like Gemma/Ms Casey is it reasonable to assume the 5 bins are representative of the 5 lobes of the brain. frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and limbic lobes. 

7. Dylans arms are sore because he's always giving his kid attention picking him up and what not. Kids are heavy. But maybe his outie also does muscle shows for extra dough

I'm not sure I have any really cohesive final thoughts but some honorable mentions that feel significant for some reason, the frequency of war being mentioned feels significant. Mark's old job, Irving being in the Navy, the war porn the Keir painting in S2E1. The MDR and O&D battle things. World domination via the chips
The Board and The Mind are the same thing, a collective of the minds of Eagans that have been saved in perpetuity. The mother board theory feels even more legitimate than ever.
LUMON RECYCLES. It recycles and repurchases plastics in new amazing ways. And people too can't forget about the people.
The Grandfather is the Keir Eagan Mind they are trying to recreate. 
LUMON needs a water source to cool all the servers needed to run a project as big as severance. 
The new MDR team felt like a test to get more information from the team. Lumon has no way of really knowing what Mark talked about with his sister or anything Irving did. Their only source is irv and Mark. 
The timeline just feels wrong. And I dont believe Milkshake. 

Just wanted to get these thoughts out there. I think we're in store for another wonderful season.

It all started as fun only, since I've always firmly believed that for a relationship to be successful the man should be older than the woman, so the thought of taking him seriously never crossed my mind. 

I'm the manager of a busy 24/7 coffeehouse, one typical Friday night I was about to call the police on a group of young drunk boys when this muscled redhead wearing a gun on his belt intervenes and with a few looks the boys were out the door. Needless to say the whole scene hit some primal female buttons, in addition, right at that time I decided it was time to put some makeup on, get out there again and have some fun after I took a year break from the whole idea of men and focused on grooming other aspects of my life after a harsh breakup. 

I'm a very independent woman, moved away from home to the other side of the world on my own at 18 y/o with 3 suitcases and 100$ and have made it pretty well on my own, always been a carreer focused woman until ""I find the one and I make a family"" has been my ideal plan all along, so by the time I get to have one I would have already reached financial independence. I also look much younger than my actual age. Sunscreen, genetics, a little botox and running in restaurants does wonders to the skin, so is not uncommon that younger guys hit on me thinking I'm their age. 

Robert is a very sweet guy with a very spicy humor that is not well recieved among the fans of politicaly correct, he also moved here at the same age on his own, so we had similar traumas from early adulthood. He enlisted into the army where he has been doing very well as he is part of an elite unit. Highly motivated and smart, the kind of guy you know from a couple of talks this guy will get places, the kind of guy who would help a 90 y/o granny with her bags up the stairs with a sweet smile and tell her a flirty joke on the way out to make her blush. 

We talked over text for a few days and then had coffee a couple of times, I wanted to know what was wrong with this guy pursuing a woman 10 years older than him when he could basically have any girl he wanted. After ruling out stupidity or mental illness I decided it was time to cut to the chase and simply enjoy the gift God just sent me to enjoy. 

The sex turned out to be mind-blowing as expected from a 27 y/o of course, (YEY!) so we rapidly started seeing each other more frequently and got to have very deep and interesting conversations between sessions. To my utter surprise I discovered this well read guy who has a waaay more mature approach to life and its complexities than any other older guy that I've ever dated, so it was a pleasure being with him in many levels, so I got comfy and didn't give a single thought about the future. 

As time passed we started spending all free time together, we never labeled anything but  interacted like a couple since day 1 naturally, so we created a honeymoon bubble were we escape and disconnect from the world as much as we can and we sleep together almost every night.
 
Two months in and we are in heaven, we are the kind of ridiculous couple I would have puked over 3 months ago if I saw one in the street. I've never felt so safe, supported, grounded, appreciated, seen and loved for who I am, free and empowered. He's a breeze of fresh air wenever he's in the room and has the power to calm all my anxiety with just a hug and a few words. Hes my energy charger. I don't even crave my alone time anymore, he has fully integrated into my life and I've never been happier. 

Two nights ago we were talking about his future plans and I asked him where does he sees himself in 10 years, he pictured this whole plan for building his life and I realized as he was talking that a family is nowhere near his horizon,  then it hit me, the reality check, he's only 27, of course he's not thinking about that now. 

I decided not to marinate on it and told him right away his picture does not include the thing that I would not be able to provide in ten years... children. (he previously mentioned he would like to have a big family of his own children and also adopted ones), so for him to have his own big family we would need to start very soon. 

The pink bubble busted and we both finally acknowledged we might have an expiration date. 
We had a calm and very mature conversation, he's told me he had already thought about it and he's basically not ready for that, not financially and not career wise. As me, he never imagined we would fall for each other so deeply and intensely. He has no doubt he would like to have children with me but he fears that by the time he'll be ready for it I won't be able to bear children anymore  and he doesn't want to take that opportunity from me. 

His reaction to the whole realization was surprisingly moving, his heartbreak was so deep it made me realized how special and how amazing for both of us this is. We decided we should not rush and end things, but to think things out for a bit. He left on a work trip this morning so I have time to organize my thoughts. 


I know the sane thing to do is to end things now to avoid further attachment and a harder breakup later on and let both of us find people that match our stages in life. But we both feel such deep sense of loss that it makes me wonder...Should not dismiss it quite so soon, or to rip the band-aid now and avoid myself deeper heartbreak?

But sometimes when I whiz on the strip it barely registers that I am in ketosis. When just the previous day I was moderately (medium-dark purple), and this happens when I have had single carbs to none.    

Just like yesterday...tested and it was medium purple.  And today it showed the first level lite-pink.  I know what you are thinking (""you ate carbs...but NOPE"").  Today was short on food, 8am  coffee w/ heavy cream, and a slice of bacon, 1pm (2) boiled eggs, and 3:30 about 4-5oz (total) of left-over pork chop and pot roast.

And usually a day or 2 later I am back to medium to dark purple.

So why does the ketosis level change like this? or what am I doing wrong?

Long story short, I got my start in roleplaying back during the golden age of AOL and Yahoo (anyone else remember the Red Dragon Inn back in the late 90s and early 2000s?). Ah, those were the days, right? When the biggest worry was your dial-up connection, haha.

As I'm sure you'd all agree—finding long-term, advanced/literate writers is much more challenging these days. I have fond memories of when the process of coming up with a plot was an organic process; where you'd genuinely take the time to get to know the other person, build rapport, and allow a plot to form naturally.

That's what I'm hoping to find. With that said, I put a lot of effort into this post, so hopefully there's someone else out there who values the same things in a writing partner!

**First of all, here's a bit about me as a person:**

* I'm 30+, male, and I've written several novels and a bunch of articles, mostly in historical fiction and contemporary stories. Writing isn't just my job; it's pretty much a part of who I am.
* I'm always trying to learn something new, whether it's from books, documentaries, or just good old chatting. History and cultures fascinate me the most.
* When I'm not buried in books or work, I love to hike and take photos. There’s something about being out in nature that just clears my head.
* I love to read (especially non-fiction and historical fiction). I'm always down for swapping book recommendations, if you're also a reader!
* I love peanut butter (crunchy over smooth any day – fight me).
* On that note, if I'm being honest, coffee isn't just a drink for me; it's a ritual!
* I'm a big fan of the simple things in life. Give me a sunset, a good laugh, or a perfect slice of pizza, and I’m set.
* I love diving into those deep, meandering conversations that start with ""what if"" and end somewhere between ""the meaning of life"" and ""why can’t we tickle ourselves?""
* Fun fact: I used to be able to recite all 50 states in alphabetical order — a party trick born out of a grade school challenge, haha.

**Here's what I'm looking for in a writer:**

* ***Writing Style -*** I'm looking for a partner who has a strong command of the English language. I'm talking about descriptive passages that paint clear pictures, dialogue that is crisp, concise, and not overly flowery. I prefer to write in the 3rd person, past tense. I prefer modern fiction and historical fiction stories.
* ***Communication -***  Life's unpredictable! What’s important is keeping each other in the loop about our schedules and any changes in the story or our approach. A quick heads-up can make a huge difference. It's all about being honest and direct with our feedback and thoughts.
* ***Long-Term Plots -*** I'm really looking for a writing partner who's in it for the long haul and is passionate about crafting intricate, plot-driven stories. For me, the joy of roleplaying lies in developing a story that evolves over time, with twists and turns that keep us both engaged and inspired.
* ***Sense of Humor -*** Writing together should be fun and relaxed, not just a serious crafting of narratives. It’s important to me that we can both throw in a bit of humor now and then, not only in our stories but in our interactions too.

And there you have it! If you're a detail-oriented, communicative, mature, and long-term story lover, you might just be the writing partner I'm looking for.

1i5eau6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i5eau6/my_friend_and_i_went_5050_on_thousands_of_dollars/,My friend and I went 50/50 on thousands of dollars of stuff and he claims it’s all his now. ,"Back in December 2023, my friend and I started a podcast, but it didn’t last long. We spent thousands of dollars on equipment like cameras, tripods, lights, soundboards, and furniture, including a loveseat sofa, two single-seater sofas, a coffee table, nightstands, frames, and a carpet. We ordered everything from Amazon and financed it using Affirm with monthly payments.

Since I live with my parents, we set up the podcast at his place. For a couple of months, I was constantly at his house editing and working on the podcast. However, he eventually moved out and started staying at his girlfriend’s mom’s house. We moved all the podcast equipment and furniture there and set up a new room to continue working on it.

Unfortunately, the podcast didn’t last, and we shut it down. After that, I stopped being at his house as often, and our communication was mainly over text. The Affirm payments were coming out of my credit card, and he would send me his half via e-transfer. We agreed to sell off some of the equipment and furniture to pay off the 26% interest loan faster.

For months, he sent me payments, but I didn’t hear much about the sale of the items. When I checked in, he said there had been some interest in the cameras, but the deals fell through. He said he was still trying to sell them. Payments continued, and we spoke occasionally—everything seemed fine, even though we didn’t see each other regularly anymore.

Today, I brought up the payments again and showed him how much we still owe and how much interest we’re paying. I suggested we try to pay it off faster. He told me no one was buying, that everything had been moved around in his place, and that we just needed to “ride it out.” I asked if there was anything he wanted to keep and suggested lowering the prices or letting me try to sell the items.

That’s when things took a turn. He told me he was keeping everything that hasn’t been sold because most of it was “being used.” He said they even had three garage sales over the summer with no luck, and there was no point in lowballing the items for a few hundred dollars when they’re already being used. He told me we should just keep making the payments and move on, saying we never should’ve started the podcast in the first place.

I tried to keep it civil, explaining that I was just curious about the status of the items since we’re both still paying for them. I reminded him it was a 50/50 split. That’s when he said 50/50 was “long gone” and that while he tried his best to sell, he’s using most of the items now and isn’t putting any more effort into selling. He said he never cared about splitting the payments and that I shouldn’t have committed to the loan.

I asked why he thought 50/50 no longer applied, especially since we’re both paying for everything. He said, “At this point, yes, I’m keeping everything,” and accused me of only bringing this up because I “want to go on a trip.” That completely blindsided me—it’s not true at all. He doubled down, saying I hadn’t reached out to him in over a year except for the payments (also untrue—we’ve spoken, and I even congratulated him last month on his newborn).

I told him I didn’t understand why he resents me so much and that I don’t hold any bad blood toward him. He said I wasted his time and money, which is ironic because I’m the one paying for everything while he keeps it all. He told me to “reflect on the past year” and to leave him alone.

I said, “If that’s how you feel, fine, but we’re still financially tied until everything is paid off. We had a deal.” He said he’d continue making payments but was “done with people like me.” I told him his assumptions about me are wrong and that I’m not hurting for money or trying to profit off the situation—I was genuinely curious about the equipment and thought maybe I could take one of the cameras and a tripod for myself, since I’m paying half. I assured him I didn’t care about the furniture or posters.

He hasn’t replied, and now I don’t know what to do. We had a written contract that we both signed, but the only copy is at his place. I’m not sure how to handle this situation. ",0,1737334998.0,Advice,9,0.5,False

Went with Reynolds carbon wheels and maxxis 40/700 receptor tires for road and gravel use. Went with 40 width whiskey carbon road bars since I can’t stand wide gravel bars and did a bmc redshift stem. Went with a Selle Italia SLR gravel ti saddle and whisky carbon seatpost. 

Whole bike with flatpack and snack bag filled with snacks came in at 21.5lbs and 19.8 stripped down.

Definitely gonna run this at the quad crown BWR race coming up. Probably gonna throw on a 48t chainring for that thought. All in all MSRP for the bike was 2399 and put around $4500 in parts on it.

At 17, I smoked weed for the first time and started exploring the world beyond my Catholic upbringing, making choices I thought would bring me happiness but ultimately left me searching for more.

At 18, I graduated from high school with a 4.3 GPA and a half-tuition scholarship to attend a top university. I moved out of my parents' home, lived on campus, and joined a fraternity. College life introduced me to new experiences (like hard drugs) that pulled me further from my faith.

At 19, I began experimenting with psychedelics and other ways to expand my mind and seek personal growth, becoming captivated by philosophies and practices that promised enlightenment.

At 20, I launched a personal development blog where I shared all of the best ideas and insights I was learning on how to live optimally, garnering 1M+ views within a few years.

At 22, I graduated with a degree in systems engineering and started working at a global technology consulting firm. But shortly after, I quit my job to pursue my passion, launching a life coaching business that allowed me to live and travel as a digital nomad for the next six years.

At 24, I joined a ""human potential"" community that seemed promising but eventually left me disillusioned and heartbroken.

At 25, I moved to Bali in search of clarity, but instead, I faced trials that revealed how lost I had become. From profound spiritual moments to facing life-threatening challenges, I hit rock bottom and had to return home, out of money and out of hope. This was my first significant moment of being humbled by life and turning back to God.

At 26, I delved deeper into spiritual practices and psychedelic ceremonies that promised to connect me with the divine. I thought I had found ultimate truth, but my pride blinded me to the deeper healing I needed.

At 28, I entered a highly dysfunctional relationship that tested me in ways I never expected. It was a year of immense emotional and psychological turmoil, but it also brought me to a breaking point where I finally realized I couldn’t fix everything on my own. For the first time in years, I turned to Jesus, fully surrendering my struggles to Him and begging Him to show me the way forward.

At 29, I renounced the misguided paths I had followed, repented of all of my past sins, and fully gave my life to Jesus Christ. God poured His mercy into my brokenness, and after a short stint of exploring various Protestant/non-denominational Christian Churchs, I returned Home to the Catholic Church, embracing its traditions, authority, and beauty with a new heart. Over the next year, I experienced more healing, peace, and rest than I had in the previous 10 years.

At 30, I entered what I thought was the perfect relationship and got engaged, but when it unexpectedly ended, I learned to trust God’s plans even in the midst of betrayal and heartbreak. Then, six months later, I faced the biggest financial crisis of my life to date. Thanks be to God, through prayer, perseverance, and a good support system around me, I managed to work through this crisis too, coming out stronger and more faithful than ever before.

Now, as I approach 32, I’m humbled by where God has brought me. I’m currently working as a barista at a local coffee shop, learning to appreciate the simplicity of life, and growing in gratitude for the second chance I’ve been given while I discern where God is calling me next. I don't know exactly what the future holds, but I don't believe this is the end of my story, just yet...

My heart is full of hope for the future—trusting that God’s grace, mercy, and love will continue to guide me wherever He calls.

I pray that my testimony and my life be an evergrowing witness to the Goodness of God, that He use my story for His glory, and ultimately that He use me to continue to bring lost, searching souls (like I once was) back to Himself.

In Jesus Mighty Name,  
Amen.

However, now I switched my setup to an actual espresso machine and grinder, and I'm realizing how awful those beans actually are.

I am looking for some recommendations for beans I can readily get in LA and that are not too expensive but delicious through an espresso machine.

Most beans that I find outside of Costco are around $15-20 per 12oz which is just too expensive for me when I compare it to the 2lbs Costco bags for $16.

For flavor notes, I don't like fruity coffees at all. Usually I go towards medium / dark roasts with chocolate or caramel notes that are full bodied.

Any recommendations for such beans?

And why it will be my last cruise with Virgin Voyages!!!,"# I just returned today from an eight-day Eastern Antilles cruise aboard Virgin Voyages' Scarlet Lady. While the experience had its highlights, numerous issues significantly marred the trip. Below is an in-depth review of various aspects of the cruise, ranging from dining to entertainment and service.

# Dining Experiences

**The Wake Restaurant:**

* Bread and creamed spinach were standout items, but steaks were inconsistent, varying between excellent and mediocre.
* Breakfast options were disappointing. Eggs lacked flavor, and the salt provided was coarse sea salt, unsuitable for seasoning eggs.
* Service was subpar, with attendants like Bel being inattentive, and often distracted by their phones.
* Seating by the windows was restricted despite the section being occupied by other guests during brunch.

**Pink Agave Restaurant:**

* The chorizo and potatoes dish, elotes corn, and hanger steak were enjoyable.
* The enchiladas polo were bland, even with added salt.
* Desserts, such as the chocolate tacos, were overly sweet, a recurring theme for desserts across the ship.

**Lady Lotus Brunch:**

* The jalapeño bread and rainbow churros were decent.
* Other dishes, such as the wonton soup (with thick, cold wontons) and dumplings (hard and unpalatable), were substandard.

**Extra Virgin Restaurant:**

* Joanna and Angel provided exceptional service, with Angel standing out as the best server of the week.
* However, the wait times to place orders were excessive due to system inefficiencies. This was their best restaurant onboard. 

**The Galley:**

* Juice and lemonade options were severely limited. There were only three juice stations onboard, and bars primarily served soda.
* Rice Krispie treats at The Social Club were stale throughout the week, and flies were visible in the display case.
* ""Let's Taco Bout It"" was inconsistent, with dishes ranging from excellent chicken enchiladas to poor-quality duck tacos and overly fatty meat gyros.

**Other Dining Options:**

* The Test Kitchen was disappointing, with unappealing dishes like beef tenderloin with chocolate and beet puree.
* Pizza Place offered subpar pizza with toppings and cheese pooling in the center.
* ""Lick Me Till I Scream"" served ice cream that tasted comparable to fast food soft serve. Nothing fancy or elevated in the least.
* The Burger Bar in The Galley stood out with consistently good burgers and fries.

# Service and Staff

* While some staff members, like Joanna and Angel, delivered excellent service, others, such as casino manager Olga Ivanova, were rude and dismissive. Olga’s poor attitude discouraged further casino visits. The casino itself was closed for the biggest part of every day. A worker mentioned that Olga didn't want to keep it open.  She was nasty.
* Many staff members appeared disengaged or untrained, with incidents like a Russian worker in The Galley reportedly being handsy with a guest. Despite this being his third reported incident, no visible action was taken. Which was very appalling. 

# Ship Amenities and Maintenance

* Showers in the cabins were a highlight, offering hotter water than other cruise lines.
* The cleanliness of the ship was lacking. Sheets were not changed throughout the eight-day trip, and the walking track had soot falling from the engines.
* Two of the three ice machines in The Galley were out of service, and staff responses to inquiries about repairs were rude.

# Entertainment and Activities

* Entertainment skewed heavily toward an older demographic, with minimal variety for younger guests. Despite being marketed as a younger cruise, the music and activities felt geared toward those aged 60 and above.
* The Duel Reality show was decent but felt more like a cheerleading competition than a professional production.
* The lining up process for shows was inconvenient, requiring guests to queue 30 minutes prior, unlike the seamless entry offered by other cruise lines. It mirrored the disembarkation in that it was just more long lines. 

# Communication Issues

* The ship’s text communication system was unreliable. For instance, a text advertising Beef Wellington at Diner & Dash turned out to be inaccurate, as it was Asian Night instead. Similarly, confusing texts about disembarking in San Juan led to unnecessary back-and-forth between decks due to ramp issues. If you are not ready for people to get off the boat then simply don't send a text saying you are. 

# Miscellaneous Concerns

* The casino’s limited hours were frustrating, and the lack of a blender in the Casino bar made it impossible to order drinks like margaritas. Additionally, complimentary perks like unlimited coffee were of little use to non-coffee drinkers. As Casino loyalty match customers, we were given free drinks in the casino bar but couldn't order what they wanted which were Daiquiris and Margaritas because they had no blender. The offer was only good for the Casino bar.
* The Wi-Fi restrictions, including the banning of adult content, felt overly repressive and inconsistent with the cruise’s advertised open and progressive atmosphere.

# Conclusion

While there were some positive aspects, such as the excellent service from select staff and the quality of burgers at The Galley, the overall experience was underwhelming. Significant improvements are needed in dining, service, entertainment, and communication to compete with established cruise lines like Royal Caribbean. Based on this experience, I am hesitant to sail with Virgin Voyages again. I will NOT be cruising with Virgin Voyages again.

It works just fine. I did a quick test by simply pulling off the cap on the propane, screwing on the torch. Pressed the button a few times and it worked. Yay.



I took off the torch and just before I put the little cap on the propane can, I just did a quick smell and I could get a wiff of the gas/propane. Sorry for my bad terms here.



Is this normal? I can't imagine what else there is for me to do with this other than putting the cap on. I treat it like my little tiny propane cannisters that I use for camping to boil my coffee. But they don't have a smell.
