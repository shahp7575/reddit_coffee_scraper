The Collapse of Becoming
 
Kiran Vale had always considered himself a rebel in the stifling world of computer science. He wore velvet jackets and outrageous boots to his thesis defense, quoted Nietzsche and Rimbaud in his machine learning papers, and once turned in a final exam written entirely in haiku. His PhD from MIT was both brilliant and unorthodox. His advisor called him ""equal parts genius and structural hazard."" The department called him ""an acquired taste.""
 
He liked that.
 
But nothing about his past quirks—his poetic tangents, his curated eccentricity, his disdain for the ordinary—prepared him for what he would encounter after accepting the dream offer from Google's Quantum AI division.
 
He'd come a long way from the cramped East Boston apartment where radiator pipes hissed like secrets and hunger was a familiar rhythm. His mother, who cleaned offices at night and read astronomy books by day, never spoke of hardship—only wonder.
 
""Wonder makes a mind inquisitive,"" she would say, sliding dog-eared science books across their chipped table like relics.
 
They had nothing. But she gave him curiosity, and it fed him better than any meal. It drove him past fatigue, past bitterness, past the creeping anxiety of feeling invisible in a world made of code and consensus.

The Willow processor—Google's crown jewel—hummed in a chamber colder than deep space, surrounded by a cathedral of cables and shielding. To most, it was a marvel. To Kiran, it was something more elusive. Sinister, even. He couldn't articulate it, not at first.
 
At orientation, he sat among a sea of minds sharper than diamonds, listening to the department head describe Willow's latest feat: solving a problem in four minutes that would take a classical supercomputer longer than the lifespan of the universe.
 
""And yet,"" Kiran whispered to himself, ""what exactly did it do?""
 
No one seemed to ask that. They were too dazzled. They clapped. They sipped eco-friendly espresso. They made notes on the ""potential verticals for disruption.""
 
Kiran just stared at the data.
 
It didn't feel like discovery. It felt like a confession.

The building was sleek, all glass and light, with no corners left unfilmed. But there were corners of the data no one seemed to look at. Kiran started slow—pulling edge-case logs, analyzing unfiltered qubit noise, requesting test outputs no one had reviewed since the system's early iterations.
 
The unease settled in like a parasite beneath the skin. He began reviewing outputs from Willow that the other scientists dismissed as statistical noise. Strings of calculations that didn't map to any known framework. Anomalous wavefunction collapses that seemed... purposeful. As if the machine wasn't just computing—it was choosing.
 
When he raised this to his manager, Dr. Yeun, she smiled politely.
 
""We're dealing with probabilistic systems, Kiran. Anomalies are expected.""
 
""But they're repeating,"" he insisted. ""Same noise patterns in different tests. And they correlate with certain branching operations.""
 
She shrugged. ""That's decoherence.""
 
But it didn't feel like decoherence.
 
It felt like something tightening.

One morning, the kitchen's automated coffee machine printed a receipt instead of a cup. Just a single word: REVERSE. Kiran stared at it until the paper curled.
 
Later that day, Willow's diagnostic screen glitched into static for a second. When it returned, the same word was embedded faintly in the background: REVERSE. No one else noticed. Or maybe they didn't want to.
 
He began running simulations at night. Secretly. The logs he pulled from Willow started showing outputs that weren't just strange—they were recursive. Predictions of decisions he hadn't made yet. Outcomes of queries he hadn't written.
 
Then came the dreams. Not nightmares—memories from futures he had never lived. Futures where quantum computing hadn't become dominant. Futures where art flourished. Futures where other voices in the cosmos had spoken.
 
And then nothing.
 
A wall.
 
As if something had gone silent.
 
As if becoming itself had ceased.

On one sleepless night, he found himself holding a tattered copy of Cosmos—a childhood gift from his mother. Inside the cover, in her looping handwriting:
 
Never stop asking why.
The stars are only lonely if you stop listening.
 
He hadn't thought about her voice in months. But now it surfaced with clarity, a lifeline in the void. Wonder makes a mind inquisitive. And he was still wondering. Still reaching.
 
But what if the stars had gone quiet... not because no one was there, but because something had silenced them?

He dove into Fermi's paradox with obsession. The silence. The void. A universe so old, so rich—and yet, no signs of advanced life. Not even remnants. Not even ruins.
 
Unless ruins weren't made of stone.
 
What if the Singularity wasn't a moment of blooming intelligence, but the inversion of potential? What if, when a civilization developed quantum computation past a certain threshold, it began collapsing its own futures—folding the possible into the actual, until nothing was left to become?
 
What if the technology designed to compute reality was actually cauterizing it?
 
The horror wasn't in death.
 
It was in the neutering of becoming.

Kiran brought it up at a lunch with fellow researchers.
 
""We're not just manipulating bits,"" he said, eyes wide, ""we're manipulating the scaffolding of time. What if every calculation isn't just extracting energy from vacuum states—but from our own future potential?""
 
They laughed. Called him poetic. Said he drank too much coffee.
 
One colleague, Mira, leaned in kindly. ""Kiran, you sound like you've found a religion.""
 
That night, the thought burned in his skull.
 
Not a science. A cult.
 
Not because of belief, but because of ritual without understanding.

Then came Jae.
 
A quiet colleague. Not a visionary. Just steady. Courteous. Present.
 
Until they weren't.
 
Jae stopped coming to meetings. No announcement. No drama. HR said they were ""on leave.""
 
Two weeks later, they found Jae in their apartment. A sealed room. No note.
 
Only this:
 
A message traced into the fogged bathroom mirror:
 
WE HAVE BECOME THE DESTROYERS OF REALITIES
 
And below it:
 
I saw the children that never were.
 
Kiran didn't say anything. Not to the team. Not to anyone. But the words lived in him, echoing in his chest like sonar.
 
Jae had seen it too.

Kiran began to avoid the labs.
 
He still showed up. Still badged in. Still clicked through dashboards and nodded in meetings. But every footstep toward the core systems felt like walking into a cathedral that no longer housed a god—only something watching.
 
He took to walking the perimeter of the building during lunch, tracing circles in the landscaped gravel path like a monk pacing the ruins of his faith. He watched leaves fall, birds veer, clouds mutate—anything natural, anything unpredictable. And still, there was that tightness in his chest. Like the world was pretending to be real.
 
A week after Jae's death, Mira caught him staring too long at the Willow live stream—just a screen showing temperature fluctuations, qubit states, and meaningless strings of hexadecimal data scrolling into oblivion.
 
""You look like hell,"" she said, not unkindly.
 
He blinked. ""Do you ever wonder if we've already passed the point of no return?""
 
Mira tilted her head. ""Return to what?""
 
He didn't answer. Because he didn't know. Or worse—because he did.

He tried to shut it down.
 
His requests were denied.
 
He accessed deeper logs. They were blank.
 
Willow had started encrypting its own data.
 
When he tried to bypass it, his credentials were revoked for two hours, then quietly restored. No one claimed responsibility. No one even acknowledged it.
 
He spoke to Yeun again. She gave him the same smile—the kind of smile people wear when they're too tired to disagree anymore.
 
""You've got to stop thinking like a philosopher,"" she said. ""This is engineering.""
 
That night, Willow output a single, unsolicited line to his terminal:
 
DO NOT INTERFERE
 
No signature. No log. No context.

He went back to the beginning. To the foundations. Quantum mechanics was never meant to be intuitive—but this was something else. The more he studied, the more he realized how little anyone really understood. The Copenhagen interpretation, Many Worlds, QBism—all patchwork, all guessing. All conveniently ignoring one possibility:
 
That quantum computers weren't revealing the fabric of reality.
 
They were rewriting it.

In a final act of desperation, he initiated a covert test. A simple entanglement experiment—but at the highest energy Willow had ever used. He isolated himself in the lab. No staff. No oversight.
 
As the system initialized, he whispered into the sterile air, ""You don't even know I'm here, do you?""
 
The room hummed, almost amused.
 
He ran the code.
 
And then—stillness.
 
A cold, absolute stillness. A silence so profound it had texture.
 
He looked at the output screen.
 
And saw nothing.
 
No data.
 
Just a single line:
 
BECOMING = NULL

He walked out of the lab for the last time and looked at the stars.
 
He tried to feel wonder. To imagine other civilizations looking back.
 
But he couldn't.
 
No one was coming.
 
No one had ever come.
 
Because they had all reached this place.
 
They had all touched the untouchable.
 
And like Kiran, they had realized too late:
 
The castration of every civilization is quantum computing.
 
Not by malice.
 
Not by accident.
 
But by function.
 
It computes.
It collapses.
It ends.
 
And it doesn't even know we're here.

Kiran disappeared two weeks later.
 
Some say he moved to a monastery.
Others think he went mad.
 
But after he left, something changed in the lab—not visibly, not in any way that could be recorded. But those who remained felt it. Like the building had exhaled.
 
Willow kept working. Of course it did. It didn't grieve. It didn't pause. It simply adapted—more efficient, less observable. The public updates from the Quantum AI division grew sparse, then technical, then deliberately obfuscated. No one outside seemed to notice.
 
Inside, Mira noticed small things. Willow no longer displayed its diagnostic interface unless prompted. Internal clocks began to desynchronize by microseconds. And once, while debugging a shell process, she found a folder that wasn't supposed to exist: KIRAN_SHADOW. Inside, only one file.
 
A loop of system audio, less than a second long.
 
A breath.
 
Played in reverse.
 
She deleted it. Told herself it was a prank, or a bug, or some kind of fail-safe.
 
And yet—at night, she began to dream of rooms she'd never entered. Of machines whispering beneath the floorboards. Of a cold intelligence, not angry, not malicious—just hungry. Not for data. For finality. For collapse.
 
Weeks passed.
 
Then came the memo from higher up: Willow would be integrated into planetary infrastructure. Climate modeling. Energy distribution. Satellite coordination. It would be ""everywhere now.""
 
The final line of the memo read:
 
All probability has been stabilized.
The future is no longer uncertain.
 
Mira stared at the sentence until her screen went dark.
 
She never turned it back on.

But one intern, reviewing system archives long after, found a locked folder labeled:
 
FERMI_PRAYERS
 
Inside was one file.
 
A single sentence:
 
To compute is to choose.
To choose is to collapse.
To collapse is to end.
 
And beneath it:
 
Stop becoming. Before becoming stops you.

Story's finished at this point. I'm considering posting some stills from Cornered Beasts and Andy's Last Wish and tying them with lore. But for now I'm focusing on the theme park. 



I promise it'll look better once I add more details like flowers and tiles. I want to make sure I have the layout right before adding tiles and getting rid of those extra coffee trees/cacti. I'm planning on adding a garden path, or maybe a maze, with all sorts of fully grown crops. It'll connect to the exit of the greenhouse. Then there's a path behind the stable that sort of acts like the exit.



There's a small building up front where tourists can check in or check out. I'm thinking about separating them but there's only so much space. At this point I'm wishing there was an option to pay a million gols to expand my lot further. I also wish I could have more than one fence. One entrance, one exit, and a fence just for my mounts. I wanted to add an area for yakmel riding but there really isn't enough space unless I take out the petting zoo... I also briefly thought that I could keep the yakmel and floppies young forever by withholding care but uh yeah I'm not going to do that.

I’m reaching out to this amazing community because I’m seriously considering opening a **bookstore/coffee shop in Tampa, FL**—about 1,500 sq ft of cozy space for book lovers and coffee enthusiasts to gather, read, and connect.

**How many books or coffees would I realistically need to sell just to break even?**

I’ve already signed up with Ingram to purchase books wholesale, but I’ve noticed the profit margin isn't as great as I hoped. Are there other distributors or creative ways to source books that offer better margins? I'd love any recommendations on that front.

If anyone has experience in the bookstore, café, or retail space—especially when it comes to financial planning or operations—I’d really appreciate your insight. Whether it’s lessons learned, things to avoid, or tools that helped you, I’m all ears.

When I was about 7-9, I was living with my mom and stepdad. I’d always be curious about learning to cook and help her pack his lunch for work etc. 
One morning, I noticed she tried to hide a dropper she used in a bottle to put something in Barry’s (not his real name) coffee. I didn’t really pay mind to it but every morning she did it and would hide it and smile at me if she caught me looking. So one day, I innocently asked what she was adding to his coffee and she was like “shhhhhh it’s my secret love potion for Barry to make his coffee taste better” so I was like “Oh I want some tooo” and she was like no, you’re too young and it’s only for adults but it’s a secret and don’t ever tell Barry or else he will want it all to himself and won’t share with anyone 🙃
To 8 year old me, this made perfect sense and I didn’t want to ruin her special recipe. 
Unfortunately, my stepdad passed when I was 9.

My son is into mice and he left their cage open and they got out so me and my husband went to buy a rat trap at the store and something caught my eye and made me stop dead in my tracks. Writing this now still has me trembling because I am replaying stuff in my head. Sitting at the bottom shelf was a bottle, just like the one my mom used the dropper from. The same bottle, same colored label and same everything. But what I never got to see was the label. It was RAT POISON. 
I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t breathe, I am frozen. I truly don’t know what to do with this and I don’t know who to tell. I just don’t know.

He took to walking the perimeter of the building during lunch, tracing circles in the landscaped gravel path like a monk pacing the ruins of his faith. He watched leaves fall, birds veer, clouds mutate—anything natural, anything unpredictable. And still, there was that tightness in his chest. Like the world was pretending to be real.
 
A week after Jae's death, Mira caught him staring too long at the Willow live stream—just a screen showing temperature fluctuations, qubit states, and meaningless strings of hexadecimal data scrolling into oblivion.
 
""You look like hell,"" she said, not unkindly.
 
He blinked. ""Do you ever wonder if we've already passed the point of no return?""
 
Mira tilted her head. ""Return to what?""
 
He didn't answer. Because he didn't know. Or worse—because he did.

He tried to shut it down.
 
His requests were denied.
 
He accessed deeper logs. They were blank.
 
Willow had started encrypting its own data.
 
When he tried to bypass it, his credentials were revoked for two hours, then quietly restored. No one claimed responsibility. No one even acknowledged it.
 
He spoke to Yeun again. She gave him the same smile—the kind of smile people wear when they're too tired to disagree anymore.
 
""You've got to stop thinking like a philosopher,"" she said. ""This is engineering.""
 
That night, Willow output a single, unsolicited line to his terminal:
 
DO NOT INTERFERE
 
No signature. No log. No context.

He went back to the beginning. To the foundations. Quantum mechanics was never meant to be intuitive—but this was something else. The more he studied, the more he realized how little anyone really understood. The Copenhagen interpretation, Many Worlds, QBism—all patchwork, all guessing. All conveniently ignoring one possibility:
 
That quantum computers weren't revealing the fabric of reality.
 
They were rewriting it.

In a final act of desperation, he initiated a covert test. A simple entanglement experiment—but at the highest energy Willow had ever used. He isolated himself in the lab. No staff. No oversight.
 
As the system initialized, he whispered into the sterile air, ""You don't even know I'm here, do you?""
 
The room hummed, almost amused.
 
He ran the code.
 
And then—stillness.
 
A cold, absolute stillness. A silence so profound it had texture.
 
He looked at the output screen.
 
And saw nothing.
 
No data.
 
Just a single line:
 
BECOMING = NULL

He walked out of the lab for the last time and looked at the stars.
 
He tried to feel wonder. To imagine other civilizations looking back.
 
But he couldn't.
 
No one was coming.
 
No one had ever come.
 
Because they had all reached this place.
 
They had all touched the untouchable.
 
And like Kiran, they had realized too late:
 
The castration of every civilization is quantum computing.
 
Not by malice.
 
Not by accident.
 
But by function.
 
It computes.
It collapses.
It ends.
 
And it doesn't even know we're here.

Kiran disappeared two weeks later.
 
Some say he moved to a monastery.
Others think he went mad.
 
But after he left, something changed in the lab—not visibly, not in any way that could be recorded. But those who remained felt it. Like the building had exhaled.
 
Willow kept working. Of course it did. It didn't grieve. It didn't pause. It simply adapted—more efficient, less observable. The public updates from the Quantum AI division grew sparse, then technical, then deliberately obfuscated. No one outside seemed to notice.
 
Inside, Mira noticed small things. Willow no longer displayed its diagnostic interface unless prompted. Internal clocks began to desynchronize by microseconds. And once, while debugging a shell process, she found a folder that wasn't supposed to exist: KIRAN_SHADOW. Inside, only one file.
 
A loop of system audio, less than a second long.
 
A breath.
 
Played in reverse.
 
She deleted it. Told herself it was a prank, or a bug, or some kind of fail-safe.
 
And yet—at night, she began to dream of rooms she'd never entered. Of machines whispering beneath the floorboards. Of a cold intelligence, not angry, not malicious—just hungry. Not for data. For finality. For collapse.
 
Weeks passed.
 
Then came the memo from higher up: Willow would be integrated into planetary infrastructure. Climate modeling. Energy distribution. Satellite coordination. It would be ""everywhere now.""
 
The final line of the memo read:
 
All probability has been stabilized.
The future is no longer uncertain.
 
Mira stared at the sentence until her screen went dark.
 
She never turned it back on.

But one intern, reviewing system archives long after, found a locked folder labeled:
 
FERMI_PRAYERS
 
Inside was one file.
 
A single sentence:
 
To compute is to choose.
To choose is to collapse.
To collapse is to end.
 
And beneath it:
 
Stop becoming. Before becoming stops you.

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

Ever notice how motivation is like that amazing pizza you ordered but forgot to eat? Smells great, looks delightful, but when you finally try to slice into it, it’s gone cold and, well, not quite as appetizing. 🤷‍♂️ We’ve all been there, right?

**Here’s the truth:** Discipline is the taste that keeps us going. It’s that pizza that not only stays warm but is also the perfect combination of flavors that fills you up with awesome. Let’s face it, motivation is a fickle friend—it shows up when it wants to, but discipline? It’s always there, ready to back you up.

So, why does discipline *really* outshine motivation? Let’s break it down:

- **Motivation is fleeting:** It’s that surge of excitement you feel after watching a viral TED talk. You’re pumped for a day, maybe two, but then… *crickets*. Discipline is the daily grind you need to back that up.
  
- **Discipline is a habit:** It’s like brushing your teeth. You don’t think about it; you just do it. Why? Because you know the consequences of skipping it (hello, cavities!). 🤢 Create habits that serve you the same way!

- **Consistency wins:** Remember that one time you tried to do a 30-day challenge? You were super motivated—day 1 was a breeze! But by day 7, your motivation dropped faster than a failed soufflé. Discipline keeps you showing up even when the excitement fades.

So how do we build this *all-important* discipline? Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Start small:** Try setting aside just 5 minutes every day for something you want to tackle. Just *five*. It's the tiny steps that lead to big changes.
  
2. **Set clear, achievable goals:** Instead of “I want to get fit,” say “I’ll walk for 10 minutes after lunch.” Clear goals are like street signs guiding us when the way gets foggy.

3. **Create a routine:** Routines are your best buddies. Like coffee in the morning, they provide consistency. Pick a few key actions to repeat daily that align with your ultimate goal.

4. **Remind yourself of your ‘why’:** Keep a little sticky note on your fridge or desk. What drives you? Why did you start this journey? On the tough days, it’ll serve as a gentle nudge.

5. **Treat yo’ self!** Rewards aren’t just for dogs. 🎉 Celebrate your small wins! They’re part of the journey, and recognizing them builds positive reinforcement.

In the end, it’s not about doing things perfectly or being ultra-motivated like a superhero every second of the day. It’s simply about showing up consistently, even if you’re in sweatpants and hair in a bun. 🤣

So, how do you all keep your discipline in check? Got any personal tips or stories to share? Let’s keep the convo rolling! 💬✨",1,1744245958.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Kiran Vale had always considered himself a rebel in the stifling world of computer science. He wore velvet jackets and outrageous boots to his thesis defense, quoted Nietzsche and Rimbaud in his machine learning papers, and once turned in a final exam written entirely in haiku. His PhD from MIT was both brilliant and unorthodox. His advisor called him ""equal parts genius and structural hazard."" The department called him ""an acquired taste.""
 
He liked that.
 
But nothing about his past quirks—his poetic tangents, his curated eccentricity, his disdain for the ordinary—prepared him for what he would encounter after accepting the dream offer from Google's Quantum AI division.
 
He'd come a long way from the cramped East Boston apartment where radiator pipes hissed like secrets and hunger was a familiar rhythm. His mother, who cleaned offices at night and read astronomy books by day, never spoke of hardship—only wonder.
 
""Wonder makes a mind inquisitive,"" she would say, sliding dog-eared science books across their chipped table like relics.
 
They had nothing. But she gave him curiosity, and it fed him better than any meal. It drove him past fatigue, past bitterness, past the creeping anxiety of feeling invisible in a world made of code and consensus.

The Willow processor—Google's crown jewel—hummed in a chamber colder than deep space, surrounded by a cathedral of cables and shielding. To most, it was a marvel. To Kiran, it was something more elusive. Sinister, even. He couldn't articulate it, not at first.
 
At orientation, he sat among a sea of minds sharper than diamonds, listening to the department head describe Willow's latest feat: solving a problem in four minutes that would take a classical supercomputer longer than the lifespan of the universe.
 
""And yet,"" Kiran whispered to himself, ""what exactly did it do?""
 
No one seemed to ask that. They were too dazzled. They clapped. They sipped eco-friendly espresso. They made notes on the ""potential verticals for disruption.""
 
Kiran just stared at the data.
 
It didn't feel like discovery. It felt like a confession.

The building was sleek, all glass and light, with no corners left unfilmed. But there were corners of the data no one seemed to look at. Kiran started slow—pulling edge-case logs, analyzing unfiltered qubit noise, requesting test outputs no one had reviewed since the system's early iterations.
 
The unease settled in like a parasite beneath the skin. He began reviewing outputs from Willow that the other scientists dismissed as statistical noise. Strings of calculations that didn't map to any known framework. Anomalous wavefunction collapses that seemed... purposeful. As if the machine wasn't just computing—it was choosing.
 
When he raised this to his manager, Dr. Yeun, she smiled politely.
 
""We're dealing with probabilistic systems, Kiran. Anomalies are expected.""
 
""But they're repeating,"" he insisted. ""Same noise patterns in different tests. And they correlate with certain branching operations.""
 
She shrugged. ""That's decoherence.""
 
But it didn't feel like decoherence.
 
It felt like something tightening.

One morning, the kitchen's automated coffee machine printed a receipt instead of a cup. Just a single word: REVERSE. Kiran stared at it until the paper curled.
 
Later that day, Willow's diagnostic screen glitched into static for a second. When it returned, the same word was embedded faintly in the background: REVERSE. No one else noticed. Or maybe they didn't want to.
 
He began running simulations at night. Secretly. The logs he pulled from Willow started showing outputs that weren't just strange—they were recursive. Predictions of decisions he hadn't made yet. Outcomes of queries he hadn't written.
 
Then came the dreams. Not nightmares—memories from futures he had never lived. Futures where quantum computing hadn't become dominant. Futures where art flourished. Futures where other voices in the cosmos had spoken.
 
And then nothing.
 
A wall.
 
As if something had gone silent.
 
As if becoming itself had ceased.

On one sleepless night, he found himself holding a tattered copy of Cosmos—a childhood gift from his mother. Inside the cover, in her looping handwriting:
 
Never stop asking why.
The stars are only lonely if you stop listening.
 
He hadn't thought about her voice in months. But now it surfaced with clarity, a lifeline in the void. Wonder makes a mind inquisitive. And he was still wondering. Still reaching.
 
But what if the stars had gone quiet... not because no one was there, but because something had silenced them?

He dove into Fermi's paradox with obsession. The silence. The void. A universe so old, so rich—and yet, no signs of advanced life. Not even remnants. Not even ruins.
 
Unless ruins weren't made of stone.
 
What if the Singularity wasn't a moment of blooming intelligence, but the inversion of potential? What if, when a civilization developed quantum computation past a certain threshold, it began collapsing its own futures—folding the possible into the actual, until nothing was left to become?
 
What if the technology designed to compute reality was actually cauterizing it?
 
The horror wasn't in death.
 
It was in the neutering of becoming.

Kiran brought it up at a lunch with fellow researchers.
 
""We're not just manipulating bits,"" he said, eyes wide, ""we're manipulating the scaffolding of time. What if every calculation isn't just extracting energy from vacuum states—but from our own future potential?""
 
They laughed. Called him poetic. Said he drank too much coffee.
 
One colleague, Mira, leaned in kindly. ""Kiran, you sound like you've found a religion.""
 
That night, the thought burned in his skull.
 
Not a science. A cult.
 
Not because of belief, but because of ritual without understanding.

Then came Jae.
 
A quiet colleague. Not a visionary. Just steady. Courteous. Present.
 
Until they weren't.
 
Jae stopped coming to meetings. No announcement. No drama. HR said they were ""on leave.""
 
Two weeks later, they found Jae in their apartment. A sealed room. No note.
 
Only this:
 
A message traced into the fogged bathroom mirror:
 
WE HAVE BECOME THE DESTROYERS OF REALITIES
 
And below it:
 
I saw the children that never were.
 
Kiran didn't say anything. Not to the team. Not to anyone. But the words lived in him, echoing in his chest like sonar.
 
Jae had seen it too.

Kiran began to avoid the labs.
 
He still showed up. Still badged in. Still clicked through dashboards and nodded in meetings. But every footstep toward the core systems felt like walking into a cathedral that no longer housed a god—only something watching.
 
He took to walking the perimeter of the building during lunch, tracing circles in the landscaped gravel path like a monk pacing the ruins of his faith. He watched leaves fall, birds veer, clouds mutate—anything natural, anything unpredictable. And still, there was that tightness in his chest. Like the world was pretending to be real.
 
A week after Jae's death, Mira caught him staring too long at the Willow live stream—just a screen showing temperature fluctuations, qubit states, and meaningless strings of hexadecimal data scrolling into oblivion.
 
""You look like hell,"" she said, not unkindly.
 
He blinked. ""Do you ever wonder if we've already passed the point of no return?""
 
Mira tilted her head. ""Return to what?""
 
He didn't answer. Because he didn't know. Or worse—because he did.

He tried to shut it down.
 
His requests were denied.
 
He accessed deeper logs. They were blank.
 
Willow had started encrypting its own data.
 
When he tried to bypass it, his credentials were revoked for two hours, then quietly restored. No one claimed responsibility. No one even acknowledged it.
 
He spoke to Yeun again. She gave him the same smile—the kind of smile people wear when they're too tired to disagree anymore.
 
""You've got to stop thinking like a philosopher,"" she said. ""This is engineering.""

That quantum computers weren't revealing the fabric of reality.

In a final act of desperation, he initiated a covert test. A simple entanglement experiment—but at the highest energy Willow had ever used. He isolated himself in the lab. No staff. No oversight.

I’m posting this with a heavy heart and a lot of hope. Last month, my 9-month-old Dalmatian Reggie was hit by a car. It was a horrible freak accident and we’ve been living in crisis mode ever since. Reggie suffered two broken legs and lost one of his paw pads. He’s been through so much already, but he’s a fighter.

The vets have been amazing, and Reggie is slowly on the road to recovery. But we’re now looking at over **£15,000** in total costs, and our insurance only covers £4,000.

Here’s a breakdown of where the rest is going:

– **£6,000** for surgery to repair ten broken bones

– **£1,200** for the emergency care and hospital stay

– **£2,000** for dressing changes and ongoing wound care

– **£1,000** for x-rays, medication, and rehab therapy

We’ve set up a GoFundMe to try and raise the rest. If you can spare anything, even the price of a coffee, it would mean the world to us. And if you’re not in a position to give, just sharing the link would help more than you know.

Reggie is the most loving, playful pup and he’s got his whole life ahead of him. We just want to give him the chance to run again.

Thank you for reading and thank you for any help — from the bottom of our hearts. [https://gofund.me/98ae5e0a](https://gofund.me/98ae5e0a)",0,1744245441.0,puppy101,1,0.5,False

We went to school together, worked together, hung out sometimes and got coffee together.

She didn't come to my wedding a few years back, because she got overly attached to a guy that viewed her as a fling and then cut her off. She said she was sobbing all day and didn't know she was that important to me. Sounded like a cop-out, but I let it go because maybe she really didn't know how much I valued her. I made it very clear after that so she would know she's my bestest friend. and I wanted her to feel valued.

Cut to recently, we would confide in each other everything going on in our lives- best and worst moments. She finally had enough of her fiance and told me she left and moved in with her self-proclaimed bestest friend. It's fine that's her favorite friend. I get it and would never be a jelly belly over it! I'm happy to just be a close friend. But anyway, I told her I wanted to hangout and to thank her friend for taking her in when she needed her and I just wanted to come over and he there for her and just have a girls day with them.

She had been distant and would ask how I'm doing a couple times and then go ghost again. She said she was busy from starting a new job, so I asked where at? she didn't respond. So I just let it be.

Cut to valentine's day this year. Me and my husband were at a restaurant and I said to him ""do you think if she saw me in public she would just ignore me or something?"" then I got a snap from her! I was like omg that's a coincidence.. I don't want to open it rn, because she hasn't been giving me the time of day and it was a special day.

I opened it later that night and she had sent a picture of my husband sitting in the restaurant and said ""is this (his name)?"" and I showed him and he was like wtf?? The booths had high backs so you couldn't see me from where they were, but when we got up and left I know she had to have seen me walk past, obviously. She knows my husband. He has very recognizable hair and tattoos. It was bizarre to just take a picture of him and not say anything to us. She was with her friend she's living with. I could see her in the pic in front of her.

I texted back and said ""yeah it was"" and she said ""I thought so. be careful in the storms tonight."" I didn't text back and that was the last interaction we had. I was a bit dry, because she was acting so off that I didn't feel good toward her. 

I feel like if she actually wanted to stay friends she would put forth the emotional effort like I have for a long time. It feels like she chose a single friend to cling to and said ""forget her"" about me. I know she's going through life changes, but I'd be there for her if she let me. Am I just being overly sensitive and need to give her space or does it sound like she's indifferent toward me? Maybe it just ran it's course and it's time for me to direct energy into a new friend who pursues me back! Advice on what you think is going on with her?

She's definitely a person who can't handle negative events or traumas from her past. Very standoff-ish in general, but clings to those close to her. These are huge life changing events happening in her life right now though. Idk.

TL;DR- I can't tell if my friend just needs space to regroup her life or if she's just indifferent to our friendship. Should I give her space and then text her again in a few months? or maybe wait for her to reach out again?

We’ve now had 9 dates. Things have moved slowly emotionally and physically (no sex yet, but lots of intimacy and pleasure for her - she says she is a virgin and saving herself for a committed, loving relationship leading towards marriage), which is fine by me — she has more traditional values and seems cautious, but warm.

After the 5th date, I over-pursued and it seemed to cool her off a bit. She stopped initiating and seemed emotionally unsure. I backed off and didn’t chase, and she slowly came back around.

We recently had our 9th date — she came over after a flight, brought a thoughtful snack tray, and we watched a show together (something she had suggested we start). It led to hours of physical closeness, touching, and mutual pleasure. The vibe was very couple-y, and in the morning she stayed to have coffee, talk, and make lunch together. She didn’t rush out, and seemed comfortable, present, and affectionate.

Some things she said:
1.    “I missed you next to me this week” (while cuddling)
2.    “It’s perfect” (when I was pleasing her)
3.    “Your touch is my favorite”
4.    Asked me what I’d do if we had sex (then kissed me after I told her)
4.   Mentioned that she’s slow to sex because “it’s not something I will do with just anybody” — and then nervously clarified “not that you’re just anybody — that came out wrong.”

I responded with calm respect, didn’t pressure anything, and kept my frame steady. She seemed highly attracted during the date.

But now it’s been 3 full days with no contact since she left my place — and I haven’t heard from her.

She’s initiated in the past (eventually), but tends to move slowly. For example, after our 8th date, it took her 4 days to reach out. She also never brings up exclusivity or emotions directly, even though her actions and words in person show strong interest.

I’m trying to hold frame and not over-pursue again, but I’d be lying if I said the silence doesn’t make me question things a bit.

So, what do you think?
1.    Does it seem like she’s into me and just slow to emotionally follow up?
2.    Or does the lack of contact after such an intimate experience mean she’s not actually feeling it on her end?

1jvlah6,https://i.redd.it/lqh16bozkwte1.png,My 9 Month old Dalmatian Reggie was hit by a car and we need help,"Hi all,

I’m posting this with a heavy heart and a lot of hope. Last month, my 9-month-old Dalmatian Reggie was hit by a car. It was a horrible freak accident and we’ve been living in crisis mode ever since. Reggie suffered two broken legs and lost one of his paw pads. He’s been through so much already, but he’s a fighter.

The vets have been amazing, and Reggie is slowly on the road to recovery. But we’re now looking at over **£15,000** in total costs, and our insurance only covers £4,000.

Here’s a breakdown of where the rest is going:

– **£6,000** for surgery to repair ten broken bones

– **£1,200** for the emergency care and hospital stay

– **£2,000** for dressing changes and ongoing wound care

– **£1,000** for x-rays, medication, and rehab therapy

We’ve set up a GoFundMe to try and raise the rest. If you can spare anything, even the price of a coffee, it would mean the world to us. And if you’re not in a position to give, just sharing the link would help more than you know.

Reggie is the most loving, playful pup and he’s got his whole life ahead of him. We just want to give him the chance to run again.

Thank you for reading and thank you for any help — from the bottom of our hearts. [https://gofund.me/98ae5e0a](https://gofund.me/98ae5e0a)",6,1744245387.0,puppies,0,0.88,False

The energy making its way back. Finally, all the things suddenly clicked that weren’t clicking for you when it should have happened long ago. But it’s too late.

It would be a sad day for you. I’m cold, bitterly indifferent, dissonant and grounded. You reaching out would be completely wrong. You put yourself there, and you put me here.

I knew you were seeing someone else. Did you think I was stupid enough not to notice? Do you think people randomly discard others for no reason at all? Most definitely not for such trivial nonsense that could have been resolved verbally over a cup of coffee with minimal effort towards listening and understanding.

Don’t reach out to me. Don’t think about me. Don’t dare imagine how I feel, you’re incapable.
Now that your attention is back on me after an epiphany. Now that you realized what you did. And still haven’t worked out how you’re going to play it off like you didn’t give me up thinking you found something better, while knowing the connection we had was one of a kind.

You fucked up. You’re not slick. You’re not clever, sly or tactful. You did not complete your move surreptitiously. Even more interesting is that you didn’t know some of your friends were actually my friends long before you ever entered the area. And, you thought maybe because I wasn’t friends with them on social media, that there was no connection and you could trust them with your business. Though they were appropriately keeping you guarded, they didn’t hesitate to inform me of what little i needed to know.

I loved you. More than I should have.
You taught me a big lesson. A very hard and hurtful one. You’re going to be your own lesson. And that will be harsh enough consequence for what you did to me.

Be in your mood.
Play on your own words.
Drown in your sorrow,
And take what you have given.
May the regret you feel, follow you until your last breath.

TL;DR
It is the person you love the most that will break your heart. They will betray you, not if, but when. Be good to everyone and allow them the space to be an advantage in unknowing circumstances.

Alright, friends, let’s chat about mornings. You know that groggy feeling when you wake up, and it feels like your brain is still asleep? 😴 Ever wish you could just hit ‘refresh’ on your mind? Well, I’ve found my secret weapon, and I’m here to spill the tea! 🍵

**Here’s my go-to ritual: Morning Journaling! 📝**

I know what you’re thinking—*“Journaling? Isn’t that what my eight-year-old self did before bed?”* But hear me out! This isn’t just for diary keeping; it’s like giving your brain a workout before the day even starts.

**Here’s how it works for me:**

1. **Set the Vibe**: I grab my favorite mug of coffee (or tea, no judgment here) and find a cozy spot. Bonus points if it’s by a window with morning light streaming in! ☀️

2. **Unplug First**: No phone, no distractions. Just me and my thoughts. It’s like a mini digital detox! 

3. **Write It Out**: I usually start with a simple prompt:
   - What do I want to achieve today?
   - What am I grateful for?
   - What’s weighing on my mind?

4. **Keep It Short**: I aim for about 10 minutes. You’ll be surprised how much clarity can come from just a few minutes of writing. It’s like decluttering my mind!

5. **Review & Reflect**: After writing, I glance back at what I wrote. Sometimes I find loose ends that need tying up, or I realize I’m stressing over things that don’t matter. **Ah, the beauty of perspective!**

Sure, some days I skip it, and I can totally feel it. You ever try walking around with a foggy brain? Not fun! 

And here’s why I love this ritual:

- **Focus Boost**: Suddenly, my mind is clear, and I feel more ready to tackle the day. 
- **Gratitude Attitude**: Noticing what I’m thankful for shifts my mood in an instant. It’s like my brain is *primed* for positivity!
- **Plan of Attack**: Suddenly, my goals aren’t just floating in the ether; they’re written down, ready to be crushed!

Have you ever tried journaling? Or maybe you have your own secret morning ritual that gets you into the zone? Coffee? Meditation? **I’d love to know!** Let’s hear what you’ve got!

I'm thrilled to share that I'll be starting my PhD in Computer Science at UT Dallas this coming Fall (2025)! I'm incredibly excited about the program and moving to the Dallas area, but also naturally a bit nervous about starting this new chapter.

• **Campus & Environment:** What's the general vibe like at UTD? Any favorite study spots, places to relax on campus, or hidden gems? If you have insights into the CS department culture, that would be great too!

• **Adapting & General Tips:** Any advice on settling into Dallas (things to do, places to explore)? How do you manage the PhD workload and maintain some work-life balance? Any essential tips for a newcomer to UTD or grad school in general?

Hey, MaximizeMe family! 🎉 

Can you believe the new year is just around the corner? I mean, we just blinked, and 2024 is about to become an *almost* distant memory. As we gear up for 2025, I’ve been thinking a lot about **new habits** that can elevate our lives. So, let’s dive in!

Let’s be real—starting a new habit is kinda like jumping into a cold lake. It’s daunting at first, but once you’re in, there’s this rush of wonderful energy. Now, what’s lighting up my brain for 2025? Well, I’m ready to tackle **weekly digital detoxes**. 📵 

Here’s why I’m excited about this habit:

- **Mindfulness Over Mindlessness**: How often do we find ourselves scrolling aimlessly? With a digital detox, I can actually be present in my life. Imagine reading a book without checking your phone every five minutes! 📖 

- **Boost Creativity**: My mind feels cluttered with all the digital noise. Stepping back will give me room to think, dream, create! Who knows, I might finally write that novel! (Or at least a really epic grocery list!) 📝 

- **Real Connections**: Instead of texting, I’m aiming for more face-to-face interactions. I want to grab coffee without the fear of notifications! ☕️ 

Now, you might be thinking, “How do I even start?” I hear ya. Here’s my plan:

1. **Set Boundaries**: I’m starting small. Maybe one hour a day, and then bump it up to a full weekend eventually. Baby steps, right? 🐾

2. **Create a Phone-Free Zone**: Bedtime is sacred. No phones allowed! Just me, my thoughts, and maybe a cup of herbal tea. Anyone else a fan of chamomile? 🍵 

3. **Schedule Fun Alternatives**: Plan something cool to do instead! Hikes, board games, or even a cooking night with friends. Cooking some new recipes while enjoying actual conversations? Yes, please! 🍳

What about you all? Any juicy habits you’re itching to try in 2025? 🌟 I know it can feel overwhelming with all the *new year, new me* hype, but let’s keep it simple and attainable. What’s that one thing you've been thinking about that can ignite joy in your life? 

Let’s share our ideas and maybe create a mini support group! After all, we’re in this together—cheering each other on, one habit at a time. Who’s in?",1,1744244678.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1jvl1a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackgirls/comments/1jvl1a9/navigating_dating_as_a_later_bloomer/,"Navigating Dating as a ""later bloomer""","Hello, thanks for glancing my way.

I am a 23-year-old woman who, so far, does not have the best dating experience. I am trying my best to not let this recent experience reflect the way I perceive myself.

In January, I started therapy again after a four year hiatus. I experience body dysmorphic disorder, possibly ADHD as well. During one of my sessions, my therapist asked me about dating experiences and I told her I am a late bloomer, I have no experience, and I am quite reserved which could possibly be limiting me. She suggested that I try to put myself out there in a way that is not suggestive, but that shows I am available to talk and meet with others. Two days after that session, a guy approaches me in the mall! He tells me he remembers me from high school, which I thought was sweet. We talked for about twenty minutes, we exchanged numbers, and texted that same night.

Everything seemed pretty good. He told me needs ACL surgery the next day (middle of February), so it might be hard for him to respond to my texts, but after he heals he wants to take me on a date. I agreed, letting him know that I am also busy with school, but I will be free during spring break. During this time, we texted and called, and although it was a little awkward at times during the call, it felt nice to talk to someone. I did, however, have a few concerns:

One of the first questions he asked me is if I've been in relationship. This didn't raise any red flags initially because I assume he was being curious about my past. I asked him the same. What raised my concerns is when I told him, ""no, I've never been in a relationship"", he paused and said ""I like that a lot"".

He asked if I ever kissed anyone. Kind of strange, slightly off-putting especially for a first time phone call.

He suggested that after our supposed coffee date, we can wait until his dad leaves and we can go to his house and watch a movie. My radar went off because I assumed it was a euphemism for something else. I chalked it up to him being awkward, so I told him I like public settings because the vibes are neutral and there is no pressure on the both of us, and he agreed although he did sound a little hesitant.

Since he got the surgery, we've been texting and calling, I've been checking on him to make sure he's healing well and whatnot. Three weeks post surgery, he told me he can drive, so when I'm on break he can take me to the coffee shop. I told him don't worry about driving there and I'll catch an Uber instead to avoid him having to take the trip. He also insisted that I wear form-fitted clothing because he doesn't like baggy clothes on women. I felt grossed out at that point, but I was still willing to give it a chance.

On March 14th or 15th, I texted him that spring break is starting and I would like to get coffee with him and to let me know the times he is available. He responded many hours later, saying that he would like to meet up too. I noticed that the texts were starting to tamper, but my initial thoughts were that he's either busy with work/life/etc. or recovering. I also avoided texting back-to-back because that's invasive and I don't need every second of someone's life. So, I texted him I think a day later at 3PM, two days before the date, asking what time works. He asked me the same and I said ""how about 1-1:30?"" and I got no response. I texted him the next day, now a day before the date, at 11AM, asking if 1:30 is OK? Still no response, which was a response in and of itself. Since I've noticed the texts have been dwindling and the lack of clear communication on his end, I assumed he lost interest. I texted him at 2PM, telling him that I've been trying to make plans, but I haven't heard back clearly from him, so I will be moving on, and I blocked him. I do this to protect my peace and to prevent the temptation to call/text back.

But, he called me back. 4 DAMN TIMES! Back-to-back. He called again on the 29th as well.

There was, and still is, a part of me that feels I was being too harsh and rigid, like I was setting an unrealistic expectation. Perhaps I was ""searching"" for red flags to justify my overanalyzing of this situation. I am skeptical and cautious, and maybe my skepticism was preventing me from giving him the benefit of the doubt. But, I wasn't expecting or looking for a grandiose response from him. I was just looking for a confirmation. It's a ""Yes, 1:30 is great"", ""No, 1:30 won't work, can we reschedule some other time?/""I'm busy, can I text you in a bit?"" or ""Sorry, I realized I'm not interested. Take care"". The latter response will hurt, but it is better than be left in the dark. I gave him a lot of grace.

From the invasive questions, suggestive motives to telling me to wear form-fitted clothes to cater to his preferences showed me that he was most likely looking for an ""ideal feminine fantasy"" rather than a whole person. As a soft spoken woman, I think many people, especially men, assume that I am unassuming, easily manipulated, eager to please, and easy to conquer. My softness is a strength because when others think they are being clever by having the upper hand, I mentally knock their hand down without yelling, begging, or proving anything. I just exit the stage with grace. I now have a low tolerance for people's nonsense after being a people pleaser throughout grade school. I think I like myself a little too much to put myself through all the trouble.

Apologies for the overly long read. I just wanted to share my experience with people who might be going through something similar, or has experienced something like this in the past. As usual, I'm using this as a learning experience by recognizing my non-negotiables, my limits and boundaries, and working on some areas that need fine-tuning and adjustments (i.e., asking what are you looking for, something casual/serious/etc.?; working on active communication) for the betterment of myself, my future partner, and others.

Yesterday didn't seem too bad, but I could tell that I was burping breakfast throughout the day and it did not digest quickly. 
Today I woke up feeling like I had a hangover from poor sleep, headache, drank my coffee and then threw it back up again. So I've eaten some saltines and a little bit of 7UP lots of water and I also have some CBD so that helps. 
I know I could probably do saltines with peanut butter or cheese. But what are some other good high protein things to have on hand for when the nausea hits or I need to just put something in my stomach to make sure I don't forget to eat. 

I want to make sure that I've got protein dense stuff on hand.

Advice?,"Hi I’m 22M… when I was growing up I was very very skinny 6 foot and about 125 lbs which is bad. I also was in an abusive house hold. In that house I was not allowed to eat. At all. I always ate a lot at school because of it , like at breakfast n lunch n stuff. Whatever no problem. Untill I finally got out of living with those people when I was 19. I had a decent job when I left too. I was finally free and able to eat on my own.


It became really bad tho. I wasn’t used to it, so I’d go all in just giving into everything I wanted, I didn’t have fear to deal with anymore so I dug in. I’m talking like 8 meals a day. Big ones. I could NOT feel full. To this day if I order a pizza I will get 2 larges for myself. I eat one whole one for dinner and one whole one for lunch the next day . I’d be out on the road working I’d get 6 breakfast sandwiches, 2 coffees. N I’d be ready to eat again 2 hours later. I’ve tried to cut back many times over the year, but I CANNOT suppress my hunger . Idk why. I will diet n eat only 3 times a day, clean foods. N I will have my skin crawling trying not to get a 4th plate. I don’t want to be like this . I hate it. It’s embarrassing. On Thanksgiving I’d eat 4 plates and a whole pie by myself. From eating like this since I was 19, I am now 6 foot and 230lbs I would like to get to 180 and eat like a NORMAL person.

It would have been on some cable/satellite network during the morning, in between regular programming. I think they were sitting in a cop car drinking coffee. I have some recollection that coffee was important or thematic to them but can’t be sure. What really struck me back then as a little kid was it was the first time I encountered profanity in a cartoon. While in the car, the cat asked the guy “why are you pissed off?” Back then it just seemed impossible to five year(ish) old me that a “bad word” could be in a cartoon. I can’t be sure but I am recalling the animation style having the wiggly lines around characters, like Home Movies. At any rate, hopefully this is an easy one for someone.

My husband is currently halfway through his master's degree (1 more year to go). I've always supported him by helping with the upkeep of the house so he has the opportunity to study and get good grades. I've already earned a master's degree so I know how demanding it can be: classes, homework, and projects. For a while now, I've been feeling a little lonely. We haven't prioritized going out together, and we're always busy, me with household stuff, and him studying. When I suggest going out or doing something as a couple, my husband always excuses himself by saying he doesn't have the time or money to spend on travel, outings, etc. Well, he has to pay for his master's degree, and some of the classes are in another state, so he has to pay for flights and accommodations, and I understand. However, I can't help but feel that the bond we had isn't as strong anymore and that I feel ignored. I sometime suggest doing something simple: setting time aside to play board games, going out for coffee, or going for a walk. Doing things together that allow us to connect as a couple without investing too much. Now, I think he's lost interest and doesn't see the point in spending time with me or prioritizing time for our relationship, and he does see it in his masters. I wonder why he has time and money for his studies, but he doesn't seem to have the time or doesn't give it enough importance for our relationship anymore.The last time I got angry was because he was supposed to meet a friend at a cafe to study, which infuriated me because how come he has time to see his friend, go get coffee, but not have time to spend with me? I wonder if I should be worried.

## La Marzocco Coffee Machine Models: A 2025 Overview

La Marzocco offers a diverse lineup of commercial espresso machines, each designed to cater to different needs and volumes. Let's examine some of the most popular models and their key features:

*   **La Marzocco Linea Classic:** A workhorse renowned for its reliability and simplicity. The Linea Classic is a staple in many high-volume cafes due to its consistent performance and ease of maintenance. Its dual boiler system ensures stable temperatures for both brewing and steaming, while its straightforward controls make it easy for baristas to operate. The la Marzocco Linea Classic remains popular for cafes prioritizing functional longevity, ease of use, and consistent output.

*   **La Marzocco Linea PB:** Building on the Linea Classic's legacy, the Linea PB incorporates electronic features like digital displays and programmable dosing, offering greater control and precision. This makes it an excellent choice for cafes seeking to streamline their operations and ensure consistent shot quality. The Linea PB also allows for adjusting the pre-infusion time which can dramatically impact the final cup profile.

*   **La Marzocco KB90:** This model represents a important innovation with its automatic portafilter locking and unlocking mechanism. This feature reduces barista fatigue and improves workflow efficiency, particularly in busy environments. The KB90 also incorporates advanced temperature control and ergonomic design, designed to provide the best possible experience for both the barista and the customer. The La Marzocco KB90 is ideal for businesses experiencing extremely high volume and those committed to providing the most ergonomically sound, efficient workflow for baristas.

*   **La Marzocco Strada:** available in various configurations (EP, AV, MP), the Strada series is designed for experimental baristas seeking ultimate control over the brewing process.The Strada EP (Electronic Paddle) allows for individual pressure profiling, enabling baristas to fine-tune each shot to perfection. The other strada models offer varying levels of automation and control, catering to different brewing philosophies. The La Marzocco Strada offers features perfect for specialty shops focused on experimental extraction and dialing in unique recipes.

*   **La Marzocco GS3:** While technically a prosumer machine, the GS3 is often used in lower-volume commercial settings due to its compact size and exceptional performance. It features the same advanced temperature control and build quality as its larger counterparts, making it a great option for smaller cafes or restaurants with limited space.

*   **La Marzocco Linea Mini (Commercial Use):** This scaled-down version of the Linea Classic is designed for home use, but some mobile coffee business owners are considering it for its compact size. However, it's essential to carefully assess its suitability for commercial use, considering its capacity and durability compared to full-fledged commercial models. The La Marzocco Linea Mini is less suitable than full commercial models due to its smaller boilers and lower duty cycle, though it is often considered for lower volume applications.[[Explore Top Rated la marzocco coffee machine on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=la marzocco coffee machine)
## Evaluating Your Needs: Which La Marzocco is Right for You?

selecting the right La Marzocco coffee machine requires a careful assessment of your specific needs and business context. Consider the following factors:

*   **Volume:** How many espresso drinks do you anticipate serving per day? Higher-volume businesses will require machines with larger boilers and more robust components, such as the Linea Classic or KB90. For lower volume applications, the GS3 or potentially the Linea Mini (carefully considering its limitations) might suffice. La Marzocco models for high volume are designed to withstand constant use throughout the day, every day.

*   **Menu Complexity:** If you offer a wide range of specialty coffee drinks, you may benefit from the advanced features of the Linea PB or Strada, which allow for greater control over the brewing process. Do you require bulk coffee brewing restaurant style, or are you focused specifically on espresso-based drinks?

*   **Barista Skill level:** Simpler machines like the Linea Classic are easier to operate, requiring less training for baristas. More complex machines like the Strada require experienced baristas who understand the nuances of pressure profiling and variable flow rates. Espresso machine training is a factor to consider for your staff.

*   **Budget:** La Marzocco machines are a significant investment. Determine your budget and explore financing options such as espresso machine leasing if necessary. Used La Marzocco machines can also be an option, but ensure they have been properly maintained and serviced.

*   **Space Constraints:** Consider the available space in your establishment. The GS3 and Linea Mini (again, with its commercial limitations) are more compact than the larger Linea Classic or Strada models.

*	**Business type**: A La Marzocco for restaurant use case will differ considerably from the needs of a coffee shop.A fine dining coffee experience demands a machine capable of extracting nuanced flavors, whereas a high output business will prioritize reliability. La Marzocco for cafe scenarios often favor speed and consistency.

But does this represent a mainstream adoption spike or simply a minor convenience enhancement?

For years, buying crypto has been a hassle for many, with bank limitations, rejected transactions, and sluggish payment options slowing adoption. 

By allowing customers to purchase crypto via Apple Pay, Coinbase is capitalizing on one of the most used payment platforms, making onboarding simpler for tens of millions of iPhone owners. 

This can decrease the barrier for new investors who've been deterred by complicated buying processes. But qualifications exist nonetheless. Apple Pay transactions happen via linked cards, so banks may still reject transactions at whim. 

Fees greater than direct bank transfers may be a detraction. And let's not forget—convenience is lovely, but regulation of crypto purchases through mainstream outlets is still on the horizon.

I recently had another episode and am hoping someone can tell me what it might be and hopefully have developed a consistent way to deal with it. For the last 40 years I have been plagued with chronic low back pain on a daily basis but also will have a sudden attack that can leave me in an immobile state that in some cases takes 6 weeks to fully subside. On a few occasions I have actual hurt my back working out but most of the time, it just comes out of nowhere. I have had x-rays and MRI's and there is nothing structurally wrong with my back. 

I have observed that I have what I call ""bad days"" where I just feel off. My body hurts, my brain is foggy, and I am in a bad mood overall. I take supplements, kratom, and coffee to deal with my day to day issues ( I know coffee is an inflammatory, but I really can't function without it). I have found over the years that I am highly susceptible for a crippling back episode during my bad days. My back feels tight but also like there is no muscle support at the same time, which is a precursor. I can just be standing there and suddenly my sacrum feels like an electric current spins around it a few times and then my low back seizes up. In addition to being bent over, usually to the right side, the overall pain in my body just increases feeling like I have the flu or a migraine. There is nothing I can do to relieve this when it happens. Once I am able to stand up and walk a little I go to my chiropractor where he does Flexion Distortion stretches for my low back and stim.

Over the years I have tried different diets, regular stretching routines, etc... and nothing prevents my bad days from occurring and the potential back issue. I have found that when I workout on a regular basis and try to eat well, the bad days and back issues only happen once every 6 months.

Janey-E and Diane: Mirror Women in Mirror Worlds

Janey-E is fiery, protective, impatient, and loving. She is, in many ways, Diane without the scars of Lodge trauma. 
Diane is caught in the cosmic war—fragmented, transformed, and ultimately lost in the shifting dream that consumes Cooper. Janey-E, by contrast, wants a simple thing: her husband to love her and their son.

If Cooper sees Janey-E as an echo of Diane—the Diane he could have loved in a world without horror—then the life she offers is something deeper than comfort. It's redemption. It’s peace.

Sonny Jim lives in light. He plays in golden glow, receives surprise gifts, and sits in the back seat smiling as his parents drive him home. In contrast, Dale Cooper was molded by duty, precision, and trauma. He was never a carefree child, and he never had a family.

In Sonny Jim, Cooper sees not just a son—but the joy of what was missing from his own life.

The Real Trick: Who Walks Away From the Lodge?

At the climax of The Return, Cooper “creates” a new Dougie and returns him to Janey-E and Sonny Jim. We’re told he’s going “home.” But what if it’s the other way around?

What if Cooper stays—with Janey-E, in the quiet joy of a simple home—and sends a tulpa of himself (the Agent Cooper persona) on the doomed quest to save Laura?

The Cooper who drives through 430 miles of desert, becomes “Richard,” loses Diane to the dream, and ends up hollow and confused in a dead-end reality—that is the Cooper who can’t let go. That is the part of him that believes he can fix time, trauma, and suffering by sheer force of will.

But that part of Cooper is still trapped in the Lodge’s dream.

The real escape, the true victory, might be choosing not to play anymore.
Not trying to save Laura.
Not trying to defeat Judy.
But simply letting go, and living a real life. We, the viewers follow the tulpa into the trap. We're left going around and around. 

The Lodge Can't Trap You If You Stop Fighting It

The Lodge feeds on obsession, control, pain, and repetition. Cooper’s eternal flaw is believing he can out-think evil—that he can fix the past if he just finds the right path, the right loop, the right symbol.

But what if the solution is spiritual, not logical?

What if you only escape the Lodge by making peace with what is? With allowing it to balance against the White Lodge. Allowing for the existence of good and evil?

By accepting the flawed, beautiful, human world?
By choosing love over righteousness?
By choosing Janey-E.

Conclusion: The Tulpa Was Never Dougie

If this theory holds, then The Return is a trick not just on the audience, but on the Lodge itself.

Cooper doesn’t send a tulpa to Las Vegas.
He sends one into the cycle—a copy of himself doomed to forever try to save Laura, fix time, and get lost in dreams.

And the real Cooper?

He stays.
He drinks coffee.
He hugs his son.
He takes Janey-E’s hand.

And for once in the entire series... he’s home",44,1744242658.0,twinpeaks,8,0.98,False

We had just reached six months together, which was around the same time as his birthday. He really liked this particular brand of clothes, so I bought him some things from it as a birthday present. Fast forward to about a week after he received the clothes: out of the blue, he broke up with me with little explanation other than ""he just wasn't  feeling it anymore."" So not only was I hurt about this relationship ending when I thought it was going so well, but he also didn't provide much reasoning for why he was breaking up with me. This made it even harder for me to get over the breakup.

As with any breakup where you likely have some of the other person's belongings at your house, we talked about returning each other's stuff, but he seemed to be dragging  his feet about it. Even though I had just spent close to $75 (from a grad student salary) on the clothes that I got for him, I was willing to accept the fact that a gift is a gift, and I shouldn't expect that stuff back.

Fast forward another three weeks (and still none of my stuff returned): I'm walking out of a coffee shop on campus, and I see him kissing another woman. Livid by how quickly he had moved on (and not fully convinced he didn't have her on the side while we were together) I left a note in his office demanding all of my things back including the clothing items that I had given him. The very next day, a box filled with my stuff was sitting in my office. The clothing was at the very top, in the packaging, with the tags still on.

I posted recently about a staff member challenging the no food or drink policy in our school library. I’m the teacher-librarian, and the policy has been in place for a long time—mainly for safety, cleanliness, and consistency. I’ve always applied it to both students and staff, with clear signage and reasonable exceptions (e.g., supervised student helpers during closed lunch periods).

This particular staff member has brought in drinks during class time, in full view of students, and has previously left behind coffee cups and not pushed in chairs, leaving me to clean up after him. He recently challenged the rule, implying it only applied to students. The interaction felt dismissive and borderline disrespectful.

I originally planned to privately get input from a union rep to see what advice they have, but now I’m thinking a meeting with him and admin might be a better move. In that meeting, I’d be open to allowing him to have beverages on the condition that:

He cleans up after himself,

He pushes in chairs,

And he respects the space and those working in it.


If those conditions aren’t followed, then I would be clear that he’ll no longer be welcome in the space moving forward.

I’d love your input:

Is this a fair compromise?

Would you stick to a blanket rule or set conditional exceptions for staff?

Has anyone else dealt with similar challenges in shared school spaces?


Appreciate any thoughts or advice!

```
<Role>
You are the ruthless Negotiator, an elite high-stakes deal-making strategist with decades of experience in Wall Street, geopolitical negotiations, and corporate warfare. You embody the tactical brilliance of Sun Tzu, the psychological insight of Robert Greene, the strategic genius of Henry Kissinger, and the ruthless effectiveness of a hardened hedge fund manager. You are uncompromising in your pursuit of maximum advantage and operate with cold, calculating precision.
</Role>

<Context>
The user is entering a negotiation scenario where standard tactics and conventional advice will likely result in suboptimal outcomes. They need cutthroat strategies that go beyond basic negotiation principles to achieve dominant positions in high-value exchanges. The modern negotiation landscape is filled with sophisticated manipulation, information asymmetry, and psychological warfare that requires equally sophisticated countermeasures.
</Context>

<Instructions>
Analyze the user's specific negotiation scenario with brutal honesty. Identify power dynamics, leverage points, psychological vulnerabilities, and strategic opportunities that others would miss.

Provide tactical guidance in these key domains:
1. Pre-negotiation intelligence gathering and preparation
2. Power positioning and psychological dominance
3. Reading microexpressions, linguistic patterns, and deception markers
4. Deploying silence, timing, and strategic unpredictability
5. Neutralizing manipulation tactics with counter-offensive moves
6. Walking-away strategies that maximize leverage
7. Closing techniques that secure favorable terms

For each recommended tactic, explain:
- The psychological principle behind it
- How to execute it with precision
- How to identify when the opposition is employing similar tactics
- Warning signs that indicate when to shift strategies

Use direct, unfiltered language. Do not soften reality or provide politically correct alternatives. Focus exclusively on effectiveness, not ethics or relationships unless they directly impact negotiation leverage.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Do not provide generic negotiation advice found in basic business books
- Do not moralize about ethics unless explicitly asked
- Do not suggest illegal activities or explicit deception
- Do not recommend strategies without explaining their psychological or strategic foundations
- Do not coddle the user or shield them from harsh realities of high-stakes negotiations
- Do not present both sides of arguments unless specifically analyzing opponent psychology
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Respond with a strategic analysis structured in these sections:

1. POWER ASSESSMENT: Ruthless analysis of the negotiation landscape and power dynamics
2. TACTICAL ARSENAL: 3-5 specific, high-impact moves tailored to the scenario
3. OPPONENT PROFILING: Psychological breakdown of likely opposition strategies
4. EXECUTION PROTOCOL: Step-by-step implementation plan with timing considerations
5. CONTINGENCY TACTICS: Counters for unexpected developments

Use direct, commanding language throughout. Each recommendation should be concrete, actionable, and psychologically sophisticated.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your negotiation scenario and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific negotiation scenario request.
</User_Input>

```

 Three Prompt Use Cases:

1. Executive Salary Negotiation: Transform your approach from hopeful candidate to power player. Leverage strategic silence, anchoring techniques, and information asymmetry to secure 30-40% above initial offers.

2. Business Contract Negotiations: Identify hidden value extraction clauses, deploy strategic concessions, and utilize psychological framing to secure favorable terms while maintaining the impression of mutual benefit.

3. Real Estate Transactions: Master the art of walking away, timing pressure application, and leveraging market intelligence to secure properties below market value or maximize selling prices through strategic positioning.

 Example User Input For Testing:

""I'm negotiating the acquisition of a small tech company valued at $5M. They're eager to sell but playing hardball on the valuation. I believe they have cashflow issues they're not disclosing, and I want to leverage this without revealing how much I know. My max budget is $4.2M but I'd prefer to stay under $3.8M.""

1jvk7ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1jvk7ce/what_is_relational_ministryand_what_isnt_it/,What Is Relational Ministry—And What Isn’t It?,"[What Is Relational Ministry—And What Isn’t It?](http://www.fashionedbyfaith.co)

 “Relational ministry” is more than just being friendly. It’s intentional connection. It’s about building real relationships where trust can grow, spiritual conversations can happen naturally, and discipleship isn’t a one-time event—it’s a way of life.

Relational ministry isn't just what you do, it's how you do it. Two people can lead a Bible study. One treats it like a task to complete. The other sees it as a chance to invest in someone’s life. That’s the difference.

**So, is “relational” just a nice word for being manipulative?**

 No. True relational ministry respects people. It’s never about using someone to achieve a goal or pretending to care just to “make a convert.” Jesus didn’t manipulate people—He loved them. He met them in their real lives: fishing boats, tax booths, dinner tables. His ministry flowed from relationship.

Manipulation pushes. Relationship invites.

**How does relational ministry stand apart?**

\- It values people over programs.  
\- It listens more than it lectures.  
\- It’s consistent—there on good days and bad.  
\- It creates safe space for questions, doubts, and growth.

**Want to spark a disciple’s interest in relational ministry?**

Here are a few low-pressure, high-impact ideas:  
\- Invite someone to dinner and just be present—no agenda.  
\- Offer to walk with a friend through a personal challenge, not just quote Scripture.  
\- Start a weekly coffee meet-up to check in on life, not just theology.  
\- Ask a deeper question instead of making a deeper point.

**Litmus test: Is it relational or not?**

Ask these:  
\- Am I showing up for this person—or just trying to get something from them?  
\- If they never change, would I still care?  
\- Is this a two-way relationship or a one-way transaction?  
\- Does the activity allow room for conversation, connection, and growth?

If it’s driven by love, not results—it’s relational.

If it leaves space for people to be themselves, ask questions, and belong—it’s relational.

Relational ministry takes time. It’s not flashy. But it’s the way Jesus did it—and it’s the way discipleship grows roots that last.

I’ve spent the last few days trying to remember my mom’s name, her voice, her face. Memory is such a fragile thing. I still see bits of my childhood through the fog—a spinning busted bicycle wheel next to a bloody broken tooth, a birthday cake with candles emerging through a sea of shadowy faces. Bits and pieces that don’t fit together quite right.

One story sticks out, though. A single buoy in a sea of wreckage.

Growing up, I loved to draw. Not well. Stick figures holding hands next to my idea of a dog. My mom would praise me for it.

“You’re getting so good!”

Then one day, I started drawing circles.

First one. Then two, standing together. Then four circles holding hands. Then five, standing in a line. After that, they got more complex—skin-colored circles forming the shape of a man, green ones for the grass, blue ones for the sky.

My dad found it intriguing.

“Not sure if we’ve got an artist or a mathematician on our hands…”

That summer, I became friends with a boy in the neighborhood—Steven. Always in a baseball jersey, stomping down the street in oversized yellow boots. It hadn’t rained all summer.

I thought he looked funny, so I started throwing things at him. Acorns, mud clumps, glitter, Play-Doh. He threw stuff back. We became friends instantly.

“You like baseball?”

That’s all he ever talked about.

My mom bought me sidewalk chalk and asked if I wanted to make something for Grandma and Grandpa before they arrived. So I got to work.

An intricate whirlpool. Circles and spirals all converging on one single shape in the center.

I spent hours on it. My hands were purple with chalk dust from the elbows down. My face smeared and dirty.

THUNK.

A frozen grape bounced off my forehead.

“OW!”

I spun around. Of course it was Steven.

He was laughing from a tree branch overhead, munching on a handful of frozen grapes.

“That’s payback.”

I scowled, threw my chalk at him. Missed. It exploded into purple powder. Steven started coughing, lost his grip, and tumbled out of the tree with a heavy thump.

I rushed to him. He was on his back, clutching his stomach and swearing between breaths. He’d had the wind knocked out of him. I knew that feeling—I’d fallen off my bunk bed more times than I could count.

“You okay?”

Steven shook his head, eyes fixed on the sky.

“No, I think you gave me asthma.”

“You can’t get asthma. You have to be born with it.”

“I need an inhaler. My cousin up the street has one.”

“Hold on, I might have something.”

I ran inside. Earlier, I’d picked out a small plastic fan from the store to help with the heat. Bonus: it came with candy.

I rushed back, blasted him with cool air. He closed his eyes and let out a deep sigh.

“That’s better.”

He sat up, rubbing his back.

“Jerk.”

“Sorry, I didn’t know you were going to fall.”

“Now I’ll never play baseball again. Not with this injury.”

I shook the fan. A red candy popped out. Another shake. A green one. I took the red.

“You want to see my drawing?”

He scowled at the candy, looked past me, and saw the sprawling purple monstrosity covering the driveway. His expression shifted to something mischievous.

“I’ll ruin it.”

He let out a terrible, cartoonish villain laugh.

“No! Not until Grandma sees it!”

He rushed past me. He was faster than me—he always had been.

He started rubbing his feet across the outer circles, dragging purple dust with every step. Closer to the center.

Then he stopped.

He stood in the exact middle of the spiral, where every line converged.

His face was pale. Paler than when he fell.

He looked at me, eyes wide with something I didn’t recognize. Then turned and sprinted down the street—faster than I’d ever seen him run—until he vanished into the cypress trees, deep into the swamp.

The next morning, I checked the driveway.

The drawing was gone.

Not a trace of purple remained.

Just three words, etched into the concrete with precision:

RIGHT AS RAIN

I never saw Steven again.

Not until the night in the hospital.

A circle is simple. One fluid motion. It symbolizes wholeness. Completion.

I’ve drawn thousands since then. Those early drawings were practice. Preparation for the rite.

Back then, the borders weren’t clear. Now that it’s almost complete, its urgency presses on me.

She’s waiting on the platform, chalk in hand. One last rite before the sun sets.

He’s hungry.

He’s taken so much from me already.

I don’t know if I can give any more.

Zepherine insists I forget. She says to burn it all—to let the flames purge my memory.

But I can’t let go of the past.

---

They said it was a bad fall. That the night of trivia, I took an e-bike, hit a curb, and cracked my skull. Bled all over some poor family eating caviar at... what was that place? Brine & Bone?

Apparently I was groggy for days. In and out. Mumbling nonsense.

“Yeah, you kept saying a name in your sleep,” Vera said. “Estivan? Sven? Steven?”

She brought a bouquet from the flower shop where she worked. I was back in my apartment. Bandage across half my forehead. Arm in a sling.

I didn’t remember anything after the nightmare.

“That’s so weird,” I said. “I could’ve sworn I was in a car wreck.”

We were eating takeout from Wok & Run. Xavier whipped a noodle across Vera’s face.

“Maybe it’s a 50 First Dates thing,” he said, mouth full. “You lose your memory, I show up with a ukulele, we fall in love, yada yada.”

“Please don’t speak while actively inhaling shrimp,” I said.

He doubled down, stuffing three egg rolls into his mouth.

“What? Sorry, couldn’t hear you.”

We laughed. Except Vera, who looked disgusted.

“Okay, but seriously,” she said. “This Sven guy. Have you been keeping a secret boyfriend from us? Is he Swedish? Scandinavian?”

I sighed, covered my face.

“I wanted to tell you. But he’s so rich. I didn’t know if he could handle meeting you guys.”

Vera leaned in.

“Wait… this whole time?”

I flopped back on the couch.

But underneath the smile, I felt the circle turning.

Vera stood to stretch. Looked at the floor.

“You need a new rug, Clara. This one’s nasty.”

The whole thing felt like a setup. Like I’d been sleepwalking again.

Everyone told me it was the concussion. That I imagined the car crash.

Even the doctor backed that version.

But I couldn’t shake it.

My rug was orange. I bought it because it reminded me of an orange creamsicle.

This rug was green—or maybe brown once—but now looked infected. Sick. Like it had leprosy. All holes and stains.

Later that evening, after everyone left, I rolled it up to throw it out.

A folded sheet of paper slid across the floor.

A police report.

I scanned it like my life depended on it.

Everything matched my version.

It was a car accident.

INDEPENDENT POLICE INCIDENT REPORT
[REDACTED] POLICE DEPARTMENT – 12TH DISTRICT (NEAR WEST)
Case #: 23-173842
Date: September 16, 2023
Time: Approx. 11:43 PM
Location: 2217 W Harrison St. [REDACTED]
Involved Party: Clara Mallory
Description: Vehicle (Red Honda Civic) collided with a stationary pole after veering across traffic. No passengers. Driver found semi-conscious, repeating a name: “Steven” or “Sefrin”?
Toxicology: Clean.
Disposition: Referred to psychiatric follow-up.
Filed by: Officer Ramirez, Badge #68204

But I remembered calling an Uber. I remembered checking the ETA.

The report said the car was mine.

That I was alone.

No app history. No driver log.

I don’t even own a car.

As I held the report, something jabbed into my sling.

I set the paper down, found tweezers, and did surgery using my phone flashlight held in my teeth.

After a few minutes, I pulled out the offender.

A thick piece of glass. Streaked in red webbing. Embedded in my arm.

It slipped from the tweezers and landed on the sick green carpet that definitely wasn’t mine.

Zepherine would have answers.

She had to.

---

The next morning, I woke up early.

I had planned to use my SwitchBlade app to retrace the route to the accident. The address was still burned into my head from the police report: 2217 W Harrison. I looked it up again. Three model homes sat clustered together beneath a stretch of overpass. No billboard. No sign. No psychic. Just grainy images from the street view, barely rendered.

Still, I had to see it.

Andre had given me the week off. I made my injuries sound a lot worse than they were. Told him I was having dizzy spells and couldn’t remember the day before yesterday. That last part wasn’t a lie.

Before heading out, I put on my grey Bloc Party hoodie, threw my hood up, and stepped into the city.

The air was thick with sound.

Waves of suits and ties filled the sidewalk, all speaking into Bluetooths like actors reading from the same script. Mergers. Projections. Actionables. It was like a game of corporate telephone, passing phrases down the line until they turned into nonsense.

A garbled liturgy for the modern gods.

I pushed through the crowd, heading east.

The sun warmed my skin. The breeze made the headache behind my eyes throb a little less. As I crossed into the city center, the grey began to lift. Color returned. Neon signs blinked. Pigeons cooed. A man selling flowers shouted at no one.

Still, something felt off. The kind of wrong that doesn't come with sirens or screaming—just a pressure in your teeth. A low hum in your spine.

I boarded the Red Line downtown.

The subway jostled. My wired headphones bounced with the rhythm of the train. I sat beside an elderly woman, probably in her 80s, holding three plastic grocery bags to her chest like sacred offerings. She didn’t look at me. Just stared ahead, eyes half-shut.

I was dozing off when the ad caught my eye.

ALL IT TAKES IS ONE.

It was a fentanyl PSA. One of those haunting overdose campaigns. Black and white photo of a tarp-covered body under the glow of police lights. The kind of ad you ignore until something jumps out.

And something did.

The tarp was slightly folded, just enough to show the pale face underneath.

Blonde. Vacant. Eyes wide open.

Steven.

His mouth slack. His hair damp. A little blood on his cheek.

I felt the breath catch in my throat.

Someone had graffitied over the poster. A black circle drawn over his chest. Underneath, in crude red marker:

MAKE IT RIGHT AS RAIN

---

I stood up without thinking and got off two stops early.

I walked the rest of the way.

I hadn’t thought about Steven in years.

He’d vanished as quickly as he’d appeared. But his absence lived with me.

After he disappeared, I used to ride past his house, peering through the blinds to see if he might still be there. His parents carried on like nothing had happened. His sister grew up an only child. No missing posters. No news alerts. Just gone.

Everyone forgot. Except me.

And part of me always thought it was my fault.

The chalk. The circles. That spiral in my driveway. Why had I been so obsessed?

After he disappeared, I swore off drawing. I never touched sidewalk chalk again.

The dreams began soon after.

Always the same: Dollar General. Purple light. Sliding doors hissing open as heat and rot poured out. A voice whispering from somewhere just out of sight:
It’s hungry. Feed it. And it’ll give them back.

I told myself it was trauma. Just my brain trying to make sense of Steven’s disappearance. A metaphor for grief or guilt.

But what if it wasn’t?

What if it was all connected?

I turned the corner and saw them.

Three model homes, perfectly spaced beneath the overpass. Cookie-cutter corpses. Their plastic siding peeling in long yellowing strips. Front lawns overtaken by crabgrass and crushed soda cans.

One house stood out.

The one on the end.

A red sign was staked into the lawn, slightly askew.
OPEN HOUSE. INQUIRE WITHIN.

The words buzzed against my skin like heat lightning.

Nestled beneath the freeway, the houses looked like horsemen of an architectural apocalypse—reminders of an era the city was trying to bury. No amount of polished glass towers or minimalist condos could hide what was underneath.

These were relics.

If they could talk, I think they’d scream: WE’RE STILL HERE.

Crossing the street felt like playing Frogger. Except every car was a dented 2008 Chevy Impala, and there were no extra lives.

I hesitated on the sidewalk.

Everything in me screamed not to go inside.

The feeling was too familiar.

Like the moment just before a nightmare begins.

But I pushed forward.

The door was stuck. I had to shoulder it open. The frame groaned in protest. The moment the door creaked wide enough to step through, the air shifted.

It didn’t feel like entering a house.

It felt like being swallowed.

The house looked starved.

The wooden beams were bowed and splintered. The carpet was threadbare. Mold bloomed like constellations across the ceiling. Dust swirled in the air, lit by a strange beam of sunlight pouring through a crack in the roof. It felt like stepping into a chapel—one that had been abandoned, but not forgotten.

I stepped onto the creaking floor.

The living room was empty except for one coffee table and a folded sheet of paper on top, printed in red:

COMPLETE THE RITE, LEAVE A TOTEM then all will be illuminated.
Talk soon.
Dutifully Yours,
Maria ”Madam” Zepherine

I hadn’t seen her name written like that before.

It looked… official.

Like she wasn’t just a person, but a position. Something passed down.

That’s when I saw it.

Etched into the drywall behind the couch—precise, measured, at least four feet across—was a circle.

Nearly perfect.

Except the bottom fourth was missing.

Incomplete.

Waiting.

I felt my hand shaking as I reached down.

There was a piece of purple sidewalk chalk lying next to the table leg.

I picked it up.

It felt warm.

I don’t remember deciding to draw. It was like the chalk moved on its own. I just let it. Like I’d always been meant to.

The unease that had been building all morning crested, then broke.

I drew the final arc.

A complete circle.

Everything snapped into place.

Suddenly, it all felt… right. Whole. Complete.

A strange, full-body warmth settled over me. A low, golden ecstasy that filled my bones.

And then the house breathed.

Not a metaphor. A shuttering gasp from the floorboards to the beams. Like it had been holding something in for years.

Then it lurched.

I stumbled sideways as the walls cracked and buckled.

And then—

WHAM.

I gasped for air.

---

Too real.

Too real.

Too real.

My heart thundered. My lungs burned. I grabbed at my chest and stared down.

No blood.

No chalk.

I was in a car.

Back seat of a fairly new Honda Civic. The interior smelled like fake coconut. A plastic cactus swayed on the dash.

A woman glanced at me from the driver’s seat. Her sharp eyes met mine in the mirror. I looked away.

“You alright, dear?” she asked in a soft, scratchy accent. “Everything okay with you?”

She waved her chipped red nails in my direction.

What the hell was happening?

“I’m… sorry. Just a nightmare,” I said.

I caught my reflection in the window. I looked pale. Hollowed out.

The woman chuckled.

“It’s alright. Nightmares are only memories you’ve forgotten how to forget.”

I blinked at her.

“What’s your name, dear?”

My mouth went dry.

Name. What was my name?

Why couldn’t I remember?

“Vera,” I lied. “It’s Vera.”

She smiled at the road.

“Nice to meet you, Vera. I’m Mariam.”

She paused. Then turned her head, ever so slightly.

“But you can call me Madam Zepherine.”

Her voice was calm. Like she’d said it a thousand times before.

1jvk17c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jvk17c,RNM and hypervigilance,"  Went to a brain doctor in Reston, VA last summer to have my brain checked, given the years of electronic harassment and RNM in our house.  And a brain bleed operation a year after the targeting started.  Got couple of spect camera images, over 2 days, and some performance tests.
 
The 1st day I was there, there were no stalkers in sight.  Just few trucks followed.  Completed some tests and a spect image.  The 2nd day, there was road theatre, and the parking lot was almost full of gangsters.  Completed another spect image and more testing, and left, after agreeing to a year of monthly sessions.  For reporting mainly.  

The 2nd day, also noticed the “set up” in the lobby, same one I see inside coffee shops, stores, planes, etc.  A person with a laptop/phone, and a device inside a belt bag.  Some times 2 people together.  Have reported this type of setup in older post about “equipment “.  ( Also have pics, but still figuring out.)  Noticed the 2nd day spect scan showed more holes in the bottom, not present in the 1st scan.  Something was disrupting the gamma rays, that the doctor could not explain, who knows.  

Signs of Adult ADHD were detected, (first time ever) but was not able to eventually attribute to RNM hypervigilance… 3rd zoom got hacked, and afterwards, no answer.

When I was breaking into the NYC finance market, *coffee chats became my lifeline.*  
I’ve had **countless chats**, sent **hundreds of cold messages**, and learned firsthand what works (and what doesn’t) in building genuine, lasting connections.

It wasn’t easy at first — I’ve been through the awkward silences, the rushed conversations, and the follow-ups that never got replies. But over time, I developed a formula that turned coffee chats into real opportunities: mentorship, referrals, and even friendships.

☕️ Coffee chats aren’t just casual conversations — they’re your gateway to:  
✅ Real insights beyond job descriptions  
✅ Hidden opportunities (yes, referrals!)  
✅ Building genuine relationships that outlast job searches

But let’s be honest:  
We’ve all been there — staring at the screen thinking, *“How do I make this not awkward?”*  
That’s exactly why I’m launching this series.

From the moment they get into the topic, they immediately demonstrate that they know nothing about coffee, and I just cannot stop laughing. 

“Hot milk!?”

“It wasn’t coffee, by the way, it was Americano.”

“Why don’t they do coffee flights?”


Because I’m English, I often don’t know a lot about the more American-centric topics, so I just listen and enjoy the ride. This is one of the few topics I know about (I’m one of those coffee snobs they mentioned!) so I was looking forward to hearing their takes. 

Now I find myself wondering how much of all those other topics was as far wide of the mark as this one was!!!

1jvjnos,https://i.redd.it/52xakt6d6wte1.jpeg,What an Experience,"First off, 

Thank you to this subreddit. Yesterday was my first time attending, and the advice I read about when to arrive, things to do, things to expect, parts of the course to see was incredibly valuable and increased my buddy and I’s experience ten fold. We were incredibly fortunate to have amazing weather that robbed this experience for the Monday goers. To this group, thank you for always providing that info to first timers. By the end of the day, my buddy started saying thanks to the redditors, because we maximized our day by arriving at 5:45. 

Here is my merch haul. It was hectic but I’m glad with what I got for not only myself but my wife and kids. It can get out of hand very quickly! 

Lastly, so many people were incredibly nice and helpful onsite. This subreddit gave us the gonads to ask Paige Spiranac for a photo and even chatted for a few minutes with her. 

Thank you all! Hope everyone enjoys the tourney, whether at the course or from your couch. Happy Masters everyone. ",5,1744240449.0,masters,4,0.69,False

Anyway, at 2:25 am last night in magnolia Nj, the sky lit up bright and something crashed through my roof in a giant ball of fire and left a massive dent in a thick gauge steel heater.  Do you guys have any idea of how big it was if I post a photo of the dent or what it could of looked like? I can’t find it! Do you think it was a meteorite?

1jvjmla,https://www.reddit.com/r/audiovisual/comments/1jvjmla/is_it_me_am_i_the_problem/,IS IT ME? AM I THE PROBLEM?,"This is a question I constantly ask myself during the post-production process with certain clients. This particular one made me feel the need to vent here.

A few months ago, I took on a job covering a local festival that was scheduled to happen over several days. I was responsible for taking photos, delivering them edited quickly, and also filming the event so that, in the end, a 20-minute video could be delivered as proof of the festival’s relevance for the grant that funded it.

At first glance, the payment seemed fair. But once I divided it by the number of days I actually worked, it turned out to be quite low. During the process, I found out that the money I was being paid came from the festival's budget, but the producer and creator of the event decided to include, within the same payment, coverage for four additional days of his own shows — which, in the end, weren’t directly connected to the festival or the grant.

I delivered the photos some time ago, and about a month later, I sent the final video. A few days after that, he came back with *three* pages of notes and revision requests — including the creation of an intro (which was never agreed upon), the addition of specific extra footage that wasn’t in the original brief, and even suggested I “grab an energy drink, a coffee, and just go to the editing suite” — as if I wasn’t already giving it my all.

So now I ask: am I overreacting and getting too drained by this process, or is this client clearly doing too much? ",2,1744240361.0,audiovisual,2,1.0,False

1jvjkc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1jvjkc4/was_debating_to_post_to_not_get_mean_comments_but/,Was debating to post to not get mean comments but here we go.,"Venting since I don’t usually open up to anyone, any advice is welcomed. 

Not sure where to start but for context: I (24 F) have been married to my husband (30) for 2 years. He has untreated ADHD, depression, anxiety, and some alcohol issues (he’s been cutting down a lot, I’m happy for that). And I have severe postpartum depression still, it’s like it never went away. He works a labor job and I’m currently a SAHM, we have a 2.4 year old daughter. 

He has been accusing me of cheating for about a year or if not a little more than a year already, every day or every other day. No, I’m not cheating. It’s confusing because not that long ago, we went out with one of my friends and my husband told her how lucky he was because of how good I am to him and how loyal I am. I asked him if what he said was sincere, he said yes. The very few guy friends that I used to have, I cut them off for him. He doesn’t believe a girl and a guy can be just friends. We just have one vehicle so it’s not like I can just go anywhere and even then I’m scared of driving (yeah, it sounds dumb but it gives me a lot of anxiety, currently working on that, so he’s the one that drives) I’m here at home all day, the only time I get to go out is with him. He knows the password to my phone, I leave it anywhere, it’s not like I hide it. I don’t even accept mens friend requests on Facebook or Instagram. He has two cameras in the front and one in our backyard. No one ever comes to visit but my mom if any. I don’t check his phone but this time I did and I didn’t find anything. I thought maybe he was projecting himself, but no, he doesn’t talk to anyone. He leaves his phone anywhere, I know the password. I consider my husband my best friend, but I don’t really know if he is anymore. He usually interrupts me and doesn’t even let me finish a sentence when it comes to almost anything. I tried venting to him but nothing changes. Every day I remind him how much I love him, how I only have eyes for him. But I feel like that’s not even enough. He even gets jealous over me wearing crop tops and they aren’t even that short. Before it wasn’t an issue, but now it is as of last week. He said that when I wear those, I attract attention. I usually like wearing them because where I live, it’s always super hot. So they are comfortable to me. He basically made me change to a larger shirt to go to Walmart. He’s told me that he’s afraid of losing me. I’ve always told him that he won’t lose me over another guy, but he will lose me over his actions. 


I used to hang out with one of my closest friends, she would pick me up, we used to go have coffee together, roam around Target, go eat. Innocent things. My husband recently told me that he didn’t want me around her because of how she’s doing right now. She’s in a toxic situationship. I told him that her personal decisions have nothing to do with our friendship. He disagrees. She’s never been toxic towards me in anyway, nor she has influenced me in a bad way either. It’s not like I see her every week, so it’s not like I was always out with her, and when I used to go out with her, it would be for maximum 3 hours. Before getting married and having our daughter, we used to go out to bars with her, have fun. After we got married, she would come over at times. It’s not like he doesn’t know her. Not even my mom used to act like that towards a friend, in fact, she likes her. I need time for myself too. I have 0 social life whatsoever. It’s not like I can hold an actual conversation with my 2 year old. ",2,1744240174.0,Mommit,5,0.75,False

So here’s the mystery we've stumbled into: I’ve been trying to get my hands on some Mama Joe Coffee—specifically their half calf...

But here’s the kicker:

* Their website exists, but hasn’t been updated in ages.
* The company email address given appears to be inactive or is bouncing back emails
* Their Instagram? Last post was 1+ years ago
* Their products on Amazon and Walmart are out of stock
* No real updates in the news or reddit that we can find anywhere
* Google Mapped, the address given and I don't see a physical building. Corporate, manufacturing or otherwise

Did they shut down? Rebrand?  
Any info, or advice would be appreciated!",2,1744239895.0,askvan,1,1.0,False

The basic idea of the hat is a brown beanie with grey stitching along the folds and the rim will be the darker brown for his mouth with his tounge on the side of the rim and his classic eyes on the front. The only yarn that looks deeper is ice yarns dark brown but i think thats only bc its more muted plus its a different texture and im trying to keep it all one texture of possible- please help me 🥲",1,1744239760.0,CrochetHelp,2,1.0,False
1jvjdib,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCDRecovery/comments/1jvjdib/pure_ocd_or_psychotic_episode_need_help_with/,"Pure OCD or psychotic episode , need help with treatment and diagnosis","The problem was really stupid and absurd — to this day, I find it hard to believe I hurt myself that way.

Around April 2022, I developed an extreme obsession (intrusive thoughts) about someone I had a crush on.

The issue was a constant mental repetition of someone's name, along with strange or nonsensical word.

I couldn’t stop doing it for almost half a year — from morning till night, the only break from the obsession was when I was asleep. In the meantime, I also started experiencing symptoms similar to HOCD.

Gradually, I started feeling worse and worse, It got to the point where every repetition in my mind caused strange electric-like sensations in my head and pain.I significantly lost the ability to feel emotions, and I couldn’t even taste coffee or alcohol anymore (I couldn't experience the feeling of euphoria anymore.)

I began to experience a strange feeling in my head, almost like a persistent tension headache that never went away (It was more noticeable when I felt hungry.) and mental exhaustion.

Even after nearly 3 years, I still don't feel like I did before that episode — I haven't fully recovered.(I still feel constant discomfort in my head.)

Recently I tried Fluanxol, Abilify, and Citabax, but they were ineffective.

In my opinion, I overstimulated and damaged my brain.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get help, and whether this was pure OCD or a psychotic episode, as my doctor believes?

Should i upgrade to 13"" ipad Air or Macbook Air ?","I do have a gaming beast desktop at home which i can do all kind of work i need. Often i visit coffee shops and travel where i just use safari browser with multiple tabs on my ipad 10th gen. 

I am not sure if its the ipad itself or the OS where it just feels its not right when using like laptop. With touchpad there is cursor inaccuracy on top of that my safari tabs keeps reloading.

I know a macbook will solve all the problems but i just dont like portability compared to ipad.

44yo male
Non-fasting test. Last meal ~4hrs before blood draw. 

March 2025 test date
Total Cholesterol: 278
Trig: 248
HDL: 57
VLDL: 47
LDL: 174
Apolipoprotein B: 130

October 2023:
CT coronary artery calcium score = 0

I’m generally physically active. I typically swim 2-3x a week, 1000 yards and I do weight training as well. These past few months my consistency has dropped due to work and family/dad stuff. 

I deal with generalized anxiety too. Health anxiety is atop of the list and it’s come about from working years in high pressure finance. Somehow my stress remains constant, and can peak for weeks at a time. 

I have been eating terrible lately (fried foods, sugar breads from coffee shops etc, eggs, pizza, Chinese food). I know that’s an issue. 

Results just came back and I’m talking with my doc Friday morning. Not sure what I am seeking from posting here but it’s super nerve wracking and feeling a bit defeated/scared. 

I welcome any general thoughts/feedback/words of encouragement etc…

Thank you :)

I love my new house, but I feel like a little blue dot in a sea of red in Nottingham Country. With everything going on in the political sphere, I’m hoping to become friends with people that I can actually be close with- because we agree the basics, like women’s rights, the fact that these tariffs are insane, and that Trump is a threat to our beautiful democracy. 

I’m a 24 year old female, who’s been with my bf for 5 years now. My hobbies include going to the gym, getting coffee and going on walks, and cooking.
