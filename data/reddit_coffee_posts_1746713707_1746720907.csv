Not. Do it. I see all these posts of kindle users in the wild, reading bare naked kindles with abandon, and they look like they're enjoying it so much. So today, in the wild terrain of my screened porch, I popped her case off. Her back is kinda silky. OMG, she is LIGHT. Apparently the case weighs almost as much as she does.  She was all tiny and precious in my hands. I can definitely see the appeal.

Then one of my pups made a bouncy jump in my direction. I clutched my kindle closely to my chest, grabbed the case, and popped her back inside, then slapped the cover shut! I don't know how y'all do it. You must have nerves of steel to go free willy in a park or coffee shop like that.🤣",0,1746720798.0,kindle,0,0.33,False

1khu0ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1khu0ir/10_days_off_coffee_feeling_like_sht/,"10 days off coffee, feeling like sh*t","I'm 47 from germany. I was a heavy coffee drinker for the last 25 yrs. At my peak in the IT industry i had 8-9 cups of coffee per day plus casual cokes and energy drinks. Tried to stop coffee multiple times in the past and always went back to the addiction after days, weeks or latest a few months.

At some point (around the age of 40) I realized that I even wouldn't feel the caffeine high anymore that I loved for so long, but that I just felt wired after enjoying this drug. But it still got me going in jobs that I didn't really enjoy. As side effects, I had terrible sleep, increased anxiety base level, horrible acid reflux and a kind of depressed  feeling all the time.

I reduced my caffeine intake over the last years to 3-4 cups per day. On rare occasions only 2 cups per day. When I stopped in the past (cold turkey) I felt relatively fast ""normal"" after 2-3 weeks with good energy. This time I tapered down during 8 weeks from 4 cups to 1/2 cup per day. I totally stopped drinking coffee 10 days ago but drink a lot of decaf.

Today is the worst day. I slept relatively good but I feel SOOO tired after work, I napped for an hour but can't find ANY motivation or drive to do things. I just feel grey inside. Completely purposeless. When I was younger, I always felt driven and inspired by things at the same time very nervous with my mind all over the place and no focus. I recently thought that caffeine got a part of myself, of  my character, because I drank it for my whole life. When I was tired -> coffee, sad -> coffee,  depressed -> coffee, happy -> COFFEE!

I have a history of shock and bonding trauma and went to therapists for the last 15 years. Maybe I also covered some of the emptiness I feel inside with my heavy caffeine consumption.

Looking for light at the end of the tunnel. Just want to connect with my pain to the community and reach out.

*Welcome, folks, to another wonderful day here in Callaway. For news around the town here today, our students at Callaway High are getting ready for the summer break, whereas many of our class of 01 students are-*

I shut the radio off with a tired hand, rubbing my eyes as my tired vision adjusted to the room. The Sun shone through the window, giving a golden hue to the messy room around me. I heard a knock on the door as I slowly sat up, rubbing my sleepy eyes. “Alarm Dad! Come on, gotta get to school.” Mary’s voice said on the other side. Damn… had I slept in again? I got out of bed, throwing on regular morning clothes before heading downstairs.

The scent of freshly cooked eggs came into my nose as I was greeted by Mary making some eggs, along with the sweet tunes of Brooks & Dunn played over the downstairs radio. She had always been more of an early bird, though today it seems I overslept more than I would have liked. It wasn’t surprising, though, considering I had to work late last night. Thank god I had the day off. 

“Morning, Dad,” she said

“Morning. Did you sleep well?” I said. 

“Yeah, I guess. It’s almost 8:30.” She said, Damn! I did sleep in. I gotta get her to school in thirty minutes! 

“Well, better get those eggs going, we gotta leave soon,” I said. I reached for the coffee pot, grabbing the warm brew. I poured the liquid into my mug, taking a nice drink. I sighed, feeling the caffeine already taking its desired effect. I was already feeling more perked up. 

“I’m almost done,” Mary said. Every time she spoke, it made me smile, even when I was down. I sat at the table as the radio station finished playing its songs and switched to the news. 

*Santa Rosa High School is today hosting a memorial for the 16 students who disappeared during the Halloween Disappearance after Santa Rosa police officially declared the victims dead after almost a year and a half of investigations. The current investigation into the case has likely ruled it to be either gang-related kidnapping or potentially ransom-related. However, conflicting reports have not fit the evidence to make the case clear-cut. With this being one of the largest disappearances in recent history, with 22 missing people, including 16 students, the case remains far from solved.*

“Santa Rosa… where is that? Sounds like the West Coast.” I said. 

“It’s in California. Northern California, to be specific.” Mary said, placing the finished eggs before me as I dug into my breakfast. 

“Ah. Those poor kids. Hope they find them.” I said. 

“Yeah. Some people in class are saying it’s aliens or some crazy cult.” Mary said.

I laughed. “Cult wouldn’t surprise me considering it’s California.” I said. I looked down at my watch. It was 8:45!

“Shit. We gotta get going.” I said, wolfing down my eggs. 

She threw on her packed bag and we headed outside to the truck. It was a warm day today, the air feeling fresh. There was hardly a cloud in the sky as the golden glow of the Sun illuminated our small town. 

I powered on the truck and drove down the street. We lived near the outer part of the town. It was somewhat unfortunate since my workplace was on the opposite side of town, but we couldn’t find another place that was closer within our budget range. 

We pulled up to the high school, kids walking in to take their classes, with people even sporting graduation robes. Seemed the graduation ceremony was today. Mary got out of the truck. 

“Alright. Have a good day. See you at three.” I said. 

“Bye Dad.” She said before closing the door. I made my way back to the house, ready to go about my daily routine. 

Walking back into the house, hearing how silent it was brought back some good memories that were now painful. Things had been tough since my wife, Madison died a year ago. We both took it hard. Mary was always someone who would put a smile on anyone. Now I hardly see her do it, though I do my best to be supportive. She didn’t seem depressed so much, more like the soul had been drained. Like she was constantly tired. 

I could relate to her feelings of tiredness. Without that second income, I had to take more shifts at the grain factory, so I always came home late and exhausted. On the few days I had off, usually it was the days that Mary was at school. I really wanted to spend more time with her, but I just didn’t have it.

I went out to the mailbox to get the mail. I opened the box and pulled the letters out. Heading back inside, I flipped through the letters. Bills on our electric, mortgage payment, insurance. It seemed endless. I sat the letters down and sighed. What a great way to start my day off. 

Suddenly, I felt my phone ring in my pocket. I pulled it out, wondering who was calling me. It was the company calling. I answered the call.

“Hello?” 

“Hey Harper. We need you to come in today. We got short staffed and just got a new shipment that needs processing.” 

I looked over to the table, seeing those bills. 

“Okay. I’ll be there as soon as I can.” I said. 

I hung up the phone, cursing myself under my breath.

*You gotta be kidding me. I can’t catch a fucking break can I?*

I threw on my work clothes before grabbing some food from the fridge. It wasn’t much, but it would have to do. I heading back outside and walked over to my neighbor, Mrs. Saddler. She was an older lady, reaching her 60s, but she was very sweet. Mary and her liked each other. Plus she was a volunteer at our local Church and Mary would often help her out there. 

I knocked on the door. The first thing to greet me was her dog Sadie, an adorable cocker spaniel that was already five years old. I could hear her giving happy barks from the other side of the door. From the stained window on the door, I could see her making her way over, shooing Sadie away from the door. The door clack open, Mrs. Saddler greeted me with a warm smile. 

“Hello Harper. How are you doing today?” She said, Even with the shitty situation at the moment, she still made me smile. 

“Hey there Mrs. Saddler. I’m doing okay.” I said, a slighting white lie. “I’m sorry to spring this on you but I have to go to work today and I won’t be able to pick up Mary. Could you please pick her up today?” I asked.

“Sure thing! I’ll pick her up. We can bake some cookies while you're at work!” She said excitedly. 

“That would be great. Again, sorry to spring this on you at the last minute. Just let her know that I’ll be back by sundown at the latest.” I said.

“Don’t be. I understand. You have a good day at work now.” She said, 

*I hope I can have a good day. Not that I hated my job or anything but a man can only work so many days before it just beats the shit out of him.*

I walked off after saying goodbye and got into my truck. I drove through the town to the grain mill, hearing more news on the radio. I pulled up on the lot, parking the truck in the parking lot. I walked into work, punching in for the day. The supervisor gave me the hours for the day and I got to work moving the new shipments of grain. Today was not going how I hoped it was but such is life now. Though I can’t keep my head down and gripe about it. Things could be worse. 

I made my way to the break room to drop off my lunch before getting to work. I walked in and took my lunch out of the fridge. All I really had was some leftover dinner, some potatoes, roast beef and carrots. Not much but it was a meal. Plus it would fill me up for the next shift. 

The door opened and my friend Paul walked in. 

“Hey Paul.” I said.

“Hey Harper. What are you doing here? Thought it was your day off.” He said.

“Please. You know we don’t get days off here. At least that’s what it feels like.” I said sarcastically.

“Heard that man. What times have you got?” 

“Gotta work until eight today.” 

“Damn man. You gotta seriously stop coming in when you don’t need to. You need a rest.”

“You know I can’t do that. Money doesn’t grow on trees. Especially in this economy.” 

“Look man, I can help you out if you need it when it comes to money.” 

“I appreciate that but I’m doing good.” I said. As much as I appreciated the fact that Paul wanted to help, I had a duty to provide for my daughter and make sure her future was secure and if that meant taking some extra shifts so be it. This wasn’t about me. This was about her.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I punched out of work, completely exhausted from the day’s work. We had three shipments come in today, which was a lot considering the workforce. That lunch had been enough to satiate my hunger for the day so I wasn’t terribly hungry now. However, I decided it would be good to at least pick something up to eat for Mary and I. 

Paul usually went to the local bar to drink after work. Many of us did. I decided to stop there before heading back to the house. I went there, ordering a beer and some French fries and a burger. Nothing too much. Paul, in classic Paul fashion, was getting himself a few rounds. Hopefully he wouldn’t be too drunk to not be able to drive home. 

I left after ordering and getting my food to go, I headed back to the house. However when I left the bar, I cured myself of staying too long. It was almost nine o clock! How did time fly by so quickly?! I guess I was more exhausted than I thought. I just hoped Mary wouldn’t be too upset. I quickly hopped in my truck and drove off back to the house. 

While driving down the street, I noticed something strange about the radio. As I was trying to turn it to a station, it kept breaking into some strange signal that kept repeating itself. It consisted of strange gurgling and growling sounds that cut in between bits of static. I tried turning the channel but it wouldn’t stop cutting in, so I just opted to turn the radio off. Must be some kind of radio glitch or something. 

As I pulled into the driveway, I noticed the light was on in the living room, but the rest of the house seemed dark. I hoped Mary was still awake and didn’t hate me for coming home late. 

I walked into the house, carrying our dinner in hand. “Hey Mary. I’m home. I brought dinner.” I said. I saw her on the couch watching TV and eating some cookies. She didn’t respond to me when I announced my arrival, I figured she must be disappointed I couldn’t be with her more today.

“I thought you were going to be back by sundown.” She said.

I sighed, sitting down next to her, placing the meal down on the coffee table in front of the TV. 

“I’m sorry okay. I had to work today and I sayed at Shotgun Annies a little too long. That was my fault.” I tried to explain. 

“Why are you always working? I thought it was your day off today.” She said.

“I’m trying to provide for you and keep the roof over our head. You’ll understand one day when you get a husband and start having a family.” I said. 

“If this is what having kids is like, I’m never having them.” She said, turning away from me.

“Don’t say that! Having you was the best decision I ever made in my life! I wouldn’t trade anything in the world for you. Me and your mother sank everything into raising you.” I said. 

Mary sat back, holding a pillow in her arms.

“I miss Mom. I wish she was here.” She said quietly. I sighed, closing my eyes. 

“Me too honey. Me too. Tell you what. I have the day off next week on Wednesday. I promise that I will not go in if they call me and we can go to the park for the day. How does that sound?” I said.

My proposal didn’t seem to cheer her up much but she wasn’t looking away anymore so it was something. “Okay Dad.” She said, 

We eat our meal, which was pretty good while flipping through TV channels. However, the signal became interrupted, much like the radio. It flashed between static noise and growling sounds, almost like it was trying to collect to some other source. “God damn it. Probably gonna have to call the cable guy to fix this.” I grumbled. After frustratingly trying to get it to stop, we opted to just flip to the DVD player instead, which thankfully was working fine.

Going through the movies we had, I decided to throw on Jurassic Park, since it was one of Mary’s favorites. As the movie played, I thought about my duty to raise Mary. Things were stable but could slip away in a hurry if things got bad. Maybe I could take up Paul’s offer for some help. Regardless, I was determined to make things up with Mary, no matter what.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I woke up to the feeling of falling off a cliff, the weight of my head sliding down as I nearly slumped over onto Mary in my slumber. Looking up at the TV screen, the Jurassic Park DV screen was playing for who knows how long. I must have fallen asleep during the movie. I looked over at Mary, seeing her passed out on the couch. Seems I wasn’t the only one who slept through the movie. 

I looked down at my watch. It was 10:30 at night, definitely time for me to hit the hay since I had work tomorrow and I needed rest. I turned off the TV before scooping up Mary. I carried her over to her room, tucking her into bed. *I’m sure she would be waking me up at eight like she did today.*

As I walked out of her room my phone vibrated in my pocket. I pulled it out, seeing it was Paul calling me. *Why is Paul calling me at this hour? Surely he’s gone back to his house by now.*

I opened up my phone and answered it. 


“Hey Harper. Sorry to call you like this late but I need you pick me up from Annies.” He said.

“God damn it man. Really?” I said, annoyed.

“Look I’m sorry man. I just had a few too many and they wouldn’t let me drive home. Please come on man. Don’t leave me here man.” He said.

I rubbed my face in annoyance. He doesn’t do this every time we go to the bar but when it does happen, it’s always at the most inconvenient time. 

“Okay. Fine. I’m on my way.” I said in an annoyed tone.

“Thanks man. I appreciate it.” He said.

“Whatever man.” I said, hanging up the phone in a huff. Man, it seems like I can’t catch a break today. This night can’t get much worse than this. I put the phone in my pocket before grabbing the keys and a flashlight. I opened the front door, walking down towards the truck. 

The night outside was cooling off, the stars twinkling in the sky. It was quite a nice night. Too bad I had to spend it bailing out my friend from the bar. I turned on my light and walked up to the truck, I noticed my flashlight was acting strange. The light kept on flickering and the bulb seemed to increase in luminosity. I gave the flashlight a smack to get it back to normal, which seemed to do the trick. 

Suddenly there was what almost seemed like a flash of light as the lights all around me increased rapidly before going dark. The house lights in not just my house but every house that I could see had gone out. I was left in the near pitch black darkness. 

What in the fuck just happened?! Did a power plant have some kind of failure? Did someone hit a powerline or something? Maybe whatever was fucking with the TV and the radio affected the power. I am starting to get worried now. Strange stuff has been happening ever since I got off work, usually involving the power. The night had become eerily quiet. The crickets and insects had just seemed to stop, with only the wind being present. 

I pulled out my phone to see if Paul had gotten back to me, only to find my phone was dead and refused to turn on. Thankfully my flashlight was still on and working, so I could still see. I hoped my truck would still work after whatever the hell was going on. I opened the truck doors and climbed. Placing the key in the ignition, I prayed the truck was still turned on. 

I cranked the keys and the truck powered on, the headlights lighting up the darkness. I breathed a sigh of relief. Thank god my truck still worked so I could get to work tomorrow, though I think the company would cut us some slack. If the power was still out by morning, I doubt I would even have work at all. Guess I could move that day at the park to tomorrow if that was the case. 

I pulled out of the driveway, making my way towards the bar. The radio wasn’t working at all, which was fine cause the last thing I needed to hear was a creepy glitchy radio when the whole town was pitch black. I drove slowly, to avoid hitting anyone or anything out at the moment. 

As I drove down the dark streets, I came to a pause at a stop sign. I kept thinking about all the creepy things that had been happening. That radio noise and TV static was getting to me. It almost sounded like… voices on the other end, but in a way that I couldn’t understand. My heart was pumping thinking about those noises. 

I happened to look out the side window and something caught my attention. I saw in the near pitch darkness someone or something running across the street into a yard. It was really hard to make out what I was seeing. I squinted, seeing what looked like… eyes… staring back at me. I blinked for a moment, only to see darkness once again. 

Oh god, now I’m seeing things in the dark! I shook my head, noticing I had been at this stop sign way too long and drove forward. I had to shake this creepy feeling off. 

*Everything is fine. It was just some power errors. You’re gonna pick up Paul at the bar, drop him off at his house, head home and in the morning, everything will be fixed and back to normal.*

I breathed out as I drove down the street. However the nagging feeling of something terrible lingered in my mind. No matter what I did I couldn’t shake this feeling that I and everyone around me was being… watched.

1khtvsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1khtvsn/i_dont_even_know/,I don't even know,"Without my mom I would be dead. I have nothing to live for at all besides her.

I have no happiness, no money, nothing is fun. I can never enjoy anything, even doing things I ""like"" I never enjoy them. I am constantly angry or sad.

I can't work because I have H-EDS and am in constant pain which puts me out of any physical labor, I have ADHD and I cant fucking focus on anything. I would rather die than work a miserable job just to survive, because just surviving is not living. And before you tell me to just ""man up and get a job"", it's functionally impossible for me to work. I can't even fucking walk for an hour without being bedridden for the next 2 days. So please, shut the fuck up about situations you know nothing about. Commenting anything about it is useless.

I can't control my own thoughts, my brain puts thoughts and images in my head which I can never stop, they are never nice/morally good. Just rude, nasty and disgusting shit which I don't agree with/would never do.

My mind is constantly racing at 40000%, hundreds of thoughts at the same time but nothing I'm actively doing, it's just constant noise 24/7, 365 days, for the last almost 27 years.

I CAN NEVER FALL ASLEEP, I have to be awake for at least 24-30hours before it's even possible for me to fall asleep. I cant just go to bed, I will just lay there for 7 hours, turning, getting sweaty and pissed off because I cant sleep which ultimately just leads me to get up again. It has been this way my whole life.

EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING. DAY.

Except for my mom, my relatives treat me like I'm mentally disabled, talking to me like I'm 8 years old.

They are all fake people, only caring about themselves and their image.

My mom raised all 5 of us, alone, while working a full time job. She also has H-EDS, not as severe but she is also in pain constantly and always has been.

Her partners (mine and my siblings dads) were never good people, treating her like shit.

But she provided for all of us and gave us everything she possibly could. 

They never visit, not even on her birthdays. All they can do is occasionally talk on the phone or meet up for a coffee.

And it's because she ""doesn't fit their image"". No one said anything like that, but I see right through them.

I fucking hate them all. They think they have a moral high ground and higher social status because they have more money. Yet they are not worth the sweat from my mom even.

My father is a piece of shit alcoholic/drug abuser who beat my mom when they were together (My earliest memory is seeing my dad beating my mom and both of them screaming, thanks) He also beat my step mom later on, a lot, often, which resulted in her screaming to me for help (I was like 10 and my dad is 6 foot 240 pounds all muscle) which put me in weird scary positions. Although he never physically hurt me or even yelled at me, fuck him.

The last straw in my mental health was losing my dog 6 months ago suddenly, I never got to say goodbye and she didn't even get to turn 9. I woke up and she was already gone. My sweet baby I love you so much and I miss you every single second. 

After she passed away neither me or my mom are the same person anymore and we never will be, this is the worst thing that has ever happened to me and if my mom wasn't alive I would've ended it all the day I got her urn home, just so I could get buried with her and our 2 other dogs we had.

They meant more to me than anyone ever has besides my mom, they are not just dogs, they were my family.

I would kill every single human if I could just see them one more time.

I wish a billionaire would just give me 20 million and I could save so many animals but that is never going to happen and I will never get that kind of money on my own.

I have no purpose in life, I mean nothing to anyone except mom, I get fucked over any chance people can.

No one will ever love me for who I truly am, which I understand.

I thought writing this would give me some form of relief, but nothing. No matter how much I write it will never be able to explain the misery I feel daily and I can't even find words for it.

Will still post this, someone might say something that can change anything, but I doubt it.

I've tried going to a psychologist, but literally everything they say I've already thought of, words can't change whatever is wrong in my mind. I've been told so much throughout my life but nothing has affected anything at all, words have no meaning. Even though I wish it was that simple.

One final thing. Saying ""There's people who have it way worse"" doesn't make my pain hurt less. It's weak.",1,1746720428.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1khttok,https://www.reddit.com/r/midlyinfuriating/comments/1khttok/i_hate_my_grandma/,I hate my grandma,"So, my (paternal) grandma has always been a sort of dick to the family. When my aunt (her daughter) died, she and my mom’s friend got into an argument at the funeral about coffee pots (sounds ridiculous, right?) that ended up turning to screaming at each other. My grandma decided to get into her face and process to keep screaming at her, then pushed her. When my das turned 50, my aunt sent him a birthday card, but on it was a list of things that he did wrong to ""hurt her"" or ""upset her."" The things on there were very mundane things like changing the guest bedroom into my mom’s scrapbooking room (god forbid they do what they want with their house). At this point, she was pretty much dead to me already because I was done with her shit, but the one things that set me off was when I woke up this morning. I had previously called her asking her about how much money was in a 529 plan that was supposed to be used for my college. For some context, my parents gave her control over the account before she started being a dick to everyone. When I checked my phone this morning, I saw a text from her. Guess what, the account had nothing. Nada, zilch, zap. I immediately told my mom and she was pissed, I mean livid. She immediately told her friend and my dad, so we’ll see how they react to it. The best part about this is that the reason there’s nothing in it is because of two things: 1. she though I had a full ride to a college because I got a scholarship for $148,000, and my mom posted on Facebook that it was a full ride before we found out that it wasn’t, and she doesn’t even have my grandma added in the first place, so my mom doesn’t know how she found out, or 2. there was never anything in the account to begin with, so when I called her to ask about how much was in the account, she lied to me saying she had to find the paperwork and stuff like that so she could look. Also, I don’t think it takes 2 WEEKS to figure out how much was in that account, so I think she just didn’t know how to tell me or she couldn’t figure out a lie

TL;DR my grandma has been being a dick to my family and now she saying she doesn’t have money that was in a 529 plan that I was using for college and she most likely lied about there ever being money in the first place",1,1746720283.0,midlyinfuriating,0,1.0,False

Is there any altenative for metamask thats more involved in security?? Something like banking systems where they have multiple level lf authentication for a single transaction (let alone opening the entire wallet on another device).

Uncle Ross.

Somehow he was alive and well, standing near the back, wearing a black suit, and beaming with his typical Cheshire cat smile. 

The very same Uncle Ross who was lying in the open casket by the dais.

I grabbed my mother’s arm and whispered. “Do you see him?”

“Huh?”

“Uncle *Ross*! Over there.”

“Not now Jacob.”

No one else in the church seemed remotely aware that the living dead were among them. The focus was on the sermon.

“We gather here today in love, sorrow, and remembrance…” the priest began.

When I looked back, Uncle Ross was sitting a row closer than before. He tugged at his peppery beard and looked at me with his wild green eyes. “*Hey Jakey!”*

Unwittingly, I let out a scream. 

The priest paused. Everyone looked at me. My mother grabbed me by the shoulder.

“Jacob what’s wrong?”

“I… Can’t you see him?”

“See *who*?”

Everyone gave me the side-eye, clearly perturbed by the spasm of a young boy. No one seemed to notice the obviously visible, smiling Uncle Ross amidst the crowd.

I pointed to where I saw him, standing three pews down.

“Uncle Ross…” I said, half-whispering, half-confused.

My mother glanced back, and shook her head. She grabbed my hand with a stern look. “Are you going to behave?”

Everyone was looking at where I had pointed to. No one appeared to notice Uncle Ross. 

But I could see him.

In fact, my uncle smiled at me, looked around himself and shrugged in a joking way, as if to say: *Uncle Ross, haven't seen him!*

I turned and closed my eyes. *There was no way this was happening. There was no way this was happening.* 

I focused on the priest, on the old, warbly, tenor of his voice.

“... A grandson, brother and a lifelong employee of *CERN*, our dearly departed made several significant contributions in his life. He had, as many said, ‘a brilliant mind’, and always lit up any room he was in...”

I grit my teeth and glanced back. 

Uncle Ross was gone. 

In his spot: empty air. 

And then a callused grip touched on my wrist. I looked up. Uncle Ross sitting beside me. 

A single finger on his lips. *“Shh.”*

A moment ago the spot beside me was bare, and now my uncle smiled, giggling through his teeth.

Fear froze me stiff.

“Just pretend I'm not here, Jakey. Don't mind me any mind.”

My mother hadn't turned an inch. She was ignoring me and watching the priest.

“Isn’t it funny?” Uncle Ross chuckled. He was speaking on a wavelength that clearly only I could hear. “All these clodpoles think I’m dead. They think I’m *dead* Jakey! But that's not my real body. No, no. That's just the duplicate. That's just the decoy.”

I turned away from this ghost and kept my eyes on the priest. I didn't know what was happening. But I knew it *wasn't supposed to be* *happening*.

“I chose you on purpose, Jakey. You were the youngest. It had to be you.”

My uncle's breath felt icy on my ear.

My whole neck was seizing up.

“You’ll be the one to turn on **the machine** in fifty years. That's all I need you to do. Turn on **the machine** in 2044. I’ll tell you more when the time comes.”

He cleared his throat and patted my right knee. My entire lower body seized up too.

Uncle Ross left his seat and walked out into the front aisle. 

“You and I versus the world, kid! Now how about we make this funeral memorable huh?” Uncle Ross grinned. “Let's commemorate a little.”

He walked up onto the dais and stood right next to the reverend.

“…Although we lost him in an unfortunate accident. His warmth, his influence, and of course, his scientific contributions will live on for many decades to come…”

Uncle Ross lifted his hand, made a fist, and then calmly *phased* it through the priest's head. It's as if my uncle was a *hologram.*

Then Uncle Ross’ pudgy two fingers poked out of the priest’s eyes—as if the priest was being gouged from the inside. The pudgy fingers wiggled and swam around the old man’s entire scalp.

The holy father froze. 

A glazed look befell his eyes. 

Silence in the church.

Everyone's breath stopped.

“Father Remy, is everything—?”

The priest collapsed to the floor, flipping and contorting violently. The seizure made him roll, spasm, and audibly tear ligaments.

“Oh my goodness!”

“Someone help!”

A thin man in a tweed suit stepped out from the front—someone from Uncle Ross’ work. 

The tweed man cleared all of the fallen candles off the stage, and sat beside the spasming reverend, protecting the old man's arms from hitting the podium.

“And look there Jakey!” Uncle Ross hunched over, standing overtop of the tweed man. “That’s Leopold! Look at him, such a good samaritan.”

My uncle pointed at Leopold's head.

“This colleague of mine was the only one smart enough to understand my work. He *knew* what I was trying to accomplish in particle physics … “

Uncle Ross walked over, his legs phasing through the struggling priest, and then squatted right beside his colleague. 

“And now, he shall know no more.”

My Uncle wrapped Leopold in a bear hug, phasing into his entire head and torso. The back of my uncle's head was superimposed over Leopold's shocked face. 

Blood gushed out of Leopold’s nose. He fell and joined the priest, seizuring violently on the stage.

“Dear God!”

“Leo!”

Everyone stared at the dais. There were now two convulsing men whipping their arms back and forth, smacking themselves into the podium. 

My mom moved to help, but I yanked her back.

“No! Get away!”

“Jacob, what are you—?”

*“AAAAAHHH!!”* 

My aunt’s scream was deafening.

She watched in horror as her husband *also* fell.  He rolled in the aisle, frothed at the mouth and joined the contagious seizure spreading throughout the church.

My uncle stood above him, laughing. “Flopping like fish!”

I tugged with inhuman strength, that’s how my mother always described it, *inhumane strength.* I pulled us both down between the pews, and out the back of the church.

After dragging my mom into the parking lot, I screamed repeatedly to *“Open the car and drive! Drive! Drive! Drive!*

My heart was in pure panic.

I remember staring out the back seat of my mom’s speeding Honda, watching my uncle casually phase through funeral attendees, leaving a trail of writhing and frothing epileptics.

As our car turned away, my uncle cupped around his mouth and yelled, “Remember Jakey! You’ll be the one to turn on **the machine!** You’ll be the one to bring me back!”

\*\*\*

I was eight years old when that incident happened. 

Eight.

Of course no one believed me. And my mother attributed my wild imagination to the trauma of the event. 

It was described as a “mass psychogenic illness”. A freak occurrence unexplainable by the police, ambulance, or anyone else. 

Most of the epileptic episodes ended, and people returned to normalcy. Sadly, some of the older victims, like the priest, passed away.

\*\*\*

I’m in my late thirties now.

And although you may not believe me. That story is true.

My whole life I’ve been living in fear. Horrified by the idea of encountering mad Uncle Ross yet again. 

He was said to have lost his mind amongst academic circles, spending his last year at CERN on probation for ‘equipment abuse’. People had reportedly seen him shoot high powered UV lasers into his temples. He became obsessed with something called “*Particle Decoherence”—* a theory that was thoroughly debunked as impossible.

I’ve seen him in nightmares. 

I’ve seen him in bathroom reflections. 

Sometimes I can feel his icy cold breath on my neck. 

I’ve seriously been worried almost every day of my life that he’s going to reappear again at some large group gathering and cause havoc. 

But thankfully that hasn’t happened. Not yet.

However, I have a feeling it will happen again soon. You see, yesterday I had a visitor.

\*\*\*

Although graying and blind in one eye, I still recognized Leopold from all those years ago. 

He came out of the blue, with a package at my apartment, and said that there had been a discovery regarding my late uncle.

“It was an old basement room, hidden behind a wall,” Leopold said. “The only reason we discovered it was because the facility was undergoing renovations.”

He lifted a small cardboard box and placed it on my kitchen counter. 

“We don't know how it's possible. But we discovered your uncle's skeleton inside.”

I blinked. “What?”

“A skeleton wearing Ross’ old uniform and name tag anyway. He was inside some kind of *makeshift* *cryogenic machine.* The rats had long ago broken in. Gnawed him to the bone.”

He swiveled the box to me and undid a flap. 

“I was visiting town and wanted to say hello to your mother. But after discovering this, I thought I should visit you first.”

I emptied the box's contents, discovered a small cotton cap with many ends. Like a Jester's cap. It looked like it was fashioned for the head of a small child. *Perhaps an 8-year-old boy.* 

“As I'm sure you know, your uncle was not *well of mind* in his final months at Geneva. We could all see it happening. He was advised to see many therapists … I don't believe he did.”

I rotated the cap in my hands, hearing the little bells jingle on each tassel.

“But I knew he always liked you. He spoke highly of his nephew.”

I looked into Leopold's remaining colored eye. “He did? Why?”

“Oh I think he saw you as a symbol of the next generation. That whatever he discovered could be passed down to you as a next of kin. That's my sense of it.”

There was a bit of black stitching on the front of the red cap. Pretty cursive letters. I stretched out the fabric.

“I don't know what he meant with this gift, but we found it within his cobwebbed and dilapidated ‘machine’. I feel certain he wanted you to have it.”

I read the whole phrase. 

*You and I versus the world kid.*

I bit my lip. A razorwire of fear coiled around my throat. I swallowed it away.

“So how did you find his skeleton at CERN? Didn't we already bury his body a long time ago?”

Leopold folded up the empty cardboard box with his pale old fingers.

“Your uncle was an enigma his whole life. No one knew why he jumped into that reactor 30 years ago.” Leo walked back to my doorway, I could tell that the topic was not a comfortable one to discuss. 

“I’ve spent a notable portion of my life trying to figure out what your uncle was thinking. But it's led me nowhere. His theory of *Particle Decoherence* was sadly proven false.”

I wanted to offer Leopold a coffee or something, he had only just arrived, but he was already wrapping his scarf back around his neck.

“Hey, you don't have to leave just yet…”

Some kind of heavy weight fell upon Leopold. Something too dark to explain. He took a few deep breaths and then, quite abruptly, grabbed both of my shoulders.

“He wanted you to have it okay. Just take it. Take the cap.""

“What?”

“Whatever you do Jacob, just stay *away* from him! If you see him again, *run*! Don't look at him. Don't talk to him. Don't pay him any attention!”

“Wait, wait, Leopold, what are you—”

Aside from the plastic versions, there’s also a plain white ceramic one available, but this one was too pretty not to get.

I’ve been wanting to add a Deep 27 style brewer to my lineup for a while now. Since you guys always mention that the flavour profile is a bit sweeter. In addition, it’ll make finishing off odd amounts of coffee easier, or when I just want a second small hit of coffee in the afternoon, or stretch out my favourite beans.",8,1746720126.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Uncle Ross.

Somehow he was alive and well, standing near the back, wearing a black suit, and beaming with his typical Cheshire cat smile. 

The very same Uncle Ross who was lying in the open casket by the dais.

I grabbed my mother’s arm and whispered. “Do you see him?”

“Huh?”

“Uncle *Ross*! Over there.”

“Not now Jacob.”

No one else in the church seemed remotely aware that the living dead were among them. The focus was on the sermon.

“We gather here today in love, sorrow, and remembrance…” the priest began.

When I looked back, Uncle Ross was sitting a row closer than before. He tugged at his peppery beard and looked at me with his wild green eyes. “*Hey Jakey!”*

Unwittingly, I let out a scream. 

The priest paused. Everyone looked at me. My mother grabbed me by the shoulder.

“Jacob what’s wrong?”

“I… Can’t you see him?”

“See *who*?”

Everyone gave me the side-eye, clearly perturbed by the spasm of a young boy. No one seemed to notice the obviously visible, smiling Uncle Ross amidst the crowd.

I pointed to where I saw him, standing three pews down.

“Uncle Ross…” I said, half-whispering, half-confused.

My mother glanced back, and shook her head. She grabbed my hand with a stern look. “Are you going to behave?”

Everyone was looking at where I had pointed to. No one appeared to notice Uncle Ross. 

But I could see him.

In fact, my uncle smiled at me, looked around himself and shrugged in a joking way, as if to say: *Uncle Ross, haven't seen him!*

I turned and closed my eyes. *There was no way this was happening. There was no way this was happening.* 

I focused on the priest, on the old, warbly, tenor of his voice.

“... A grandson, brother and a lifelong employee of *CERN*, our dearly departed made several significant contributions in his life. He had, as many said, ‘a brilliant mind’, and always lit up any room he was in...”

I grit my teeth and glanced back. 

Uncle Ross was gone. 

In his spot: empty air. 

And then a callused grip touched on my wrist. I looked up. Uncle Ross sitting beside me. 

A single finger on his lips. *“Shh.”*

A moment ago the spot beside me was bare, and now my uncle smiled, giggling through his teeth.

Fear froze me stiff.

“Just pretend I'm not here, Jakey. Don't mind me any mind.”

My mother hadn't turned an inch. She was ignoring me and watching the priest.

“Isn’t it funny?” Uncle Ross chuckled. He was speaking on a wavelength that clearly only I could hear. “All these clodpoles think I’m dead. They think I’m *dead* Jakey! But that's not my real body. No, no. That's just the duplicate. That's just the decoy.”

I turned away from this ghost and kept my eyes on the priest. I didn't know what was happening. But I knew it *wasn't supposed to be* *happening*.

“I chose you on purpose, Jakey. You were the youngest. It had to be you.”

My uncle's breath felt icy on my ear.

My whole neck was seizing up.

“You’ll be the one to turn on **the machine** in fifty years. That's all I need you to do. Turn on **the machine** in 2044. I’ll tell you more when the time comes.”

He cleared his throat and patted my right knee. My entire lower body seized up too.

Uncle Ross left his seat and walked out into the front aisle. 

“You and I versus the world, kid! Now how about we make this funeral memorable huh?” Uncle Ross grinned. “Let's commemorate a little.”

He walked up onto the dais and stood right next to the reverend.

“…Although we lost him in an unfortunate accident. His warmth, his influence, and of course, his scientific contributions will live on for many decades to come…”

Uncle Ross lifted his hand, made a fist, and then calmly *phased* it through the priest's head. It's as if my uncle was a *hologram.*

Then Uncle Ross’ pudgy two fingers poked out of the priest’s eyes—as if the priest was being gouged from the inside. The pudgy fingers wiggled and swam around the old man’s entire scalp.

The holy father froze. 

A glazed look befell his eyes. 

Silence in the church.

Everyone's breath stopped.

“Father Remy, is everything—?”

The priest collapsed to the floor, flipping and contorting violently. The seizure made him roll, spasm, and audibly tear ligaments.

“Oh my goodness!”

“Someone help!”

A thin man in a tweed suit stepped out from the front—someone from Uncle Ross’ work. 

The tweed man cleared all of the fallen candles off the stage, and sat beside the spasming reverend, protecting the old man's arms from hitting the podium.

“And look there Jakey!” Uncle Ross hunched over, standing overtop of the tweed man. “That’s Leopold! Look at him, such a good samaritan.”

My uncle pointed at Leopold's head.

“This colleague of mine was the only one smart enough to understand my work. He *knew* what I was trying to accomplish in particle physics … “

Uncle Ross walked over, his legs phasing through the struggling priest, and then squatted right beside his colleague. 

“And now, he shall know no more.”

My Uncle wrapped Leopold in a bear hug, phasing into his entire head and torso. The back of my uncle's head was superimposed over Leopold's shocked face. 

Blood gushed out of Leopold’s nose. He fell and joined the priest, seizuring violently on the stage.

“Dear God!”

“Leo!”

Everyone stared at the dais. There were now two convulsing men whipping their arms back and forth, smacking themselves into the podium. 

My mom moved to help, but I yanked her back.

“No! Get away!”

“Jacob, what are you—?”

*“AAAAAHHH!!”* 

My aunt’s scream was deafening.

She watched in horror as her husband *also* fell.  He rolled in the aisle, frothed at the mouth and joined the contagious seizure spreading throughout the church.

My uncle stood above him, laughing. “Flopping like fish!”

I tugged with inhuman strength, that’s how my mother always described it, *inhumane strength.* I pulled us both down between the pews, and out the back of the church.

After dragging my mom into the parking lot, I screamed repeatedly to *“Open the car and drive! Drive! Drive! Drive!*

My heart was in pure panic.

I remember staring out the back seat of my mom’s speeding Honda, watching my uncle casually phase through funeral attendees, leaving a trail of writhing and frothing epileptics.

As our car turned away, my uncle cupped around his mouth and yelled, “Remember Jakey! You’ll be the one to turn on **the machine!** You’ll be the one to bring me back!”

\*\*\*

I was eight years old when that incident happened. 

Eight.

Of course no one believed me. And my mother attributed my wild imagination to the trauma of the event. 

It was described as a “mass psychogenic illness”. A freak occurrence unexplainable by the police, ambulance, or anyone else. 

Most of the epileptic episodes ended, and people returned to normalcy. Sadly, some of the older victims, like the priest, passed away.

\*\*\*

I’m in my late thirties now.

And although you may not believe me. That story is true.

My whole life I’ve been living in fear. Horrified by the idea of encountering mad Uncle Ross yet again. 

He was said to have lost his mind amongst academic circles, spending his last year at CERN on probation for ‘equipment abuse’. People had reportedly seen him shoot high powered UV lasers into his temples. He became obsessed with something called “*Particle Decoherence”—* a theory that was thoroughly debunked as impossible.

I’ve seen him in nightmares. 

I’ve seen him in bathroom reflections. 

Sometimes I can feel his icy cold breath on my neck. 

I’ve seriously been worried almost every day of my life that he’s going to reappear again at some large group gathering and cause havoc. 

But thankfully that hasn’t happened. Not yet.

However, I have a feeling it will happen again soon. You see, yesterday I had a visitor.

\*\*\*

Although graying and blind in one eye, I still recognized Leopold from all those years ago. 

He came out of the blue, with a package at my apartment, and said that there had been a discovery regarding my late uncle.

“It was an old basement room, hidden behind a wall,” Leopold said. “The only reason we discovered it was because the facility was undergoing renovations.”

He lifted a small cardboard box and placed it on my kitchen counter. 

“We don't know how it's possible. But we discovered your uncle's skeleton inside.”

I blinked. “What?”

“A skeleton wearing Ross’ old uniform and name tag anyway. He was inside some kind of *makeshift* *cryogenic machine.* The rats had long ago broken in. Gnawed him to the bone.”

He swiveled the box to me and undid a flap. 

“I was visiting town and wanted to say hello to your mother. But after discovering this, I thought I should visit you first.”

I emptied the box's contents, discovered a small cotton cap with many ends. Like a Jester's cap. It looked like it was fashioned for the head of a small child. *Perhaps an 8-year-old boy.* 

“As I'm sure you know, your uncle was not *well of mind* in his final months at Geneva. We could all see it happening. He was advised to see many therapists … I don't believe he did.”

I rotated the cap in my hands, hearing the little bells jingle on each tassel.

“But I knew he always liked you. He spoke highly of his nephew.”

I looked into Leopold's remaining colored eye. “He did? Why?”

“Oh I think he saw you as a symbol of the next generation. That whatever he discovered could be passed down to you as a next of kin. That's my sense of it.”

There was a bit of black stitching on the front of the red cap. Pretty cursive letters. I stretched out the fabric.

“I don't know what he meant with this gift, but we found it within his cobwebbed and dilapidated ‘machine’. I feel certain he wanted you to have it.”

I read the whole phrase. 

*You and I versus the world kid.*

I bit my lip. A razorwire of fear coiled around my throat. I swallowed it away.

“So how did you find his skeleton at CERN? Didn't we already bury his body a long time ago?”

Leopold folded up the empty cardboard box with his pale old fingers.

“Your uncle was an enigma his whole life. No one knew why he jumped into that reactor 30 years ago.” Leo walked back to my doorway, I could tell that the topic was not a comfortable one to discuss. 

“I’ve spent a notable portion of my life trying to figure out what your uncle was thinking. But it's led me nowhere. His theory of *Particle Decoherence* was sadly proven false.”

I wanted to offer Leopold a coffee or something, he had only just arrived, but he was already wrapping his scarf back around his neck.

“Hey, you don't have to leave just yet…”

Some kind of heavy weight fell upon Leopold. Something too dark to explain. He took a few deep breaths and then, quite abruptly, grabbed both of my shoulders.

“He wanted you to have it okay. Just take it. Take the cap.""

“What?”

“Whatever you do Jacob, just stay *away* from him! If you see him again, *run*! Don't look at him. Don't talk to him. Don't pay him any attention!”

“Wait, wait, Leopold, what are you—”

“Your uncle is supposed to be *dead,* Jacob. And no matter what promises you, he’s lying. Your uncle is supposed to be dead! HE’S SUPPOSED TO BE GODDAMN [DEAD!](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/comments/1g0837r/welcome/)”",1,1746720121.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

Please Read Louise!,"So, I need to write this down to move on with my life. So I went through a ton of shit and my therapist closed down. I was devastated to say the least as it was very sudden and was only given a week notice. So this is about what happened after…

So I made a new friend , she was also as screwed up as I was. We triggered each other massively . It was not a healthy friendship. That friendship went badly and ended. 

I went through the next few years having sex with random men, had a few relationships nothing serious. Went on holiday with one of the guys. And was poisoned with anti freeze. Spent a while in intensive care. It was agony the pain and being so close to death. I’m not gonna say it made me realise how precious life was, it actually made me angry. My health deteriorated a lot after that. I spent a lot of time in intensive care , the last admission I was in for 6 weeks.  It’s basically my body trying to kill myself from the inside and there is no cure. I’m not angry anymore I have fully accepted it and decided to create a bucket list. I keep having to add things as I have lived longer than I thought I would tbh. Haha
I have not lost my sense of humour. 

I spent the next few years traveling and doing things I always wanted to do. Until I ended up in a wheelchair and that took a back seat. 

Don’t get me wrong it was not easy getting to where I am now. I spent 6 months having treatment at the hospital for my mental health. 
I look about 10 years older than I am and my body is fucked. But I’m happy. I have never been happier in my life. I moved away and started again. (Which I have done a few times over the years) I adopted the most amazing dog and he is my life. I am still able to work and managed to save and buy my own house. I’m very proud of how far I have come. Yes I will die sooner than some , however death no longer scares me. The hallucinations at the end are crazy and I have a lot of funny stories. Death is not the end, it’s a new beginning.

Then Uncle Ross’ pudgy two fingers poked out of the priest’s eyes—as if the priest was being gouged from the inside. The pudgy fingers wiggled and swam around the old man’s entire scalp.

The holy father froze. 

A glazed look befell his eyes. 

Silence in the church.

Everyone's breath stopped.

“Father Remy, is everything—?”

The priest collapsed to the floor, flipping and contorting violently. The seizure made him roll, spasm, and audibly tear ligaments.

“Oh my goodness!”

“Someone help!”

A thin man in a tweed suit stepped out from the front—someone from Uncle Ross’ work. 

The tweed man cleared all of the fallen candles off the stage, and sat beside the spasming reverend, protecting the old man's arms from hitting the podium.

“And look there Jakey!” Uncle Ross hunched over, standing overtop of the tweed man. “That’s Leopold! Look at him, such a good samaritan.”

My uncle pointed at Leopold's head.

“This colleague of mine was the only one smart enough to understand my work. He *knew* what I was trying to accomplish in particle physics … “

Uncle Ross walked over, his legs phasing through the struggling priest, and then squatted right beside his colleague. 

“And now, he shall know no more.”

My Uncle wrapped Leopold in a bear hug, phasing into his entire head and torso. The back of my uncle's head was superimposed over Leopold's shocked face. 

Blood gushed out of Leopold’s nose. He fell and joined the priest, seizuring violently on the stage.

“Dear God!”

“Leo!”

Everyone stared at the dais. There were now two convulsing men whipping their arms back and forth, smacking themselves into the podium. 

My mom moved to help, but I yanked her back.

“No! Get away!”

“Jacob, what are you—?”

*“AAAAAHHH!!”* 

My aunt’s scream was deafening.

She watched in horror as her husband *also* fell.  He rolled in the aisle, frothed at the mouth and joined the contagious seizure spreading throughout the church.

My uncle stood above him, laughing. “Flopping like fish!”

I tugged with inhuman strength, that’s how my mother always described it, *inhumane strength.* I pulled us both down between the pews, and out the back of the church.

After dragging my mom into the parking lot, I screamed repeatedly to *“Open the car and drive! Drive! Drive! Drive!*

My heart was in pure panic.

I remember staring out the back seat of my mom’s speeding Honda, watching my uncle casually phase through funeral attendees, leaving a trail of writhing and frothing epileptics.

As our car turned away, my uncle cupped around his mouth and yelled, “Remember Jakey! You’ll be the one to turn on **the machine!** You’ll be the one to bring me back!”

\*\*\*

I was eight years old when that incident happened. 

Eight.

Of course no one believed me. And my mother attributed my wild imagination to the trauma of the event. 

It was described as a “mass psychogenic illness”. A freak occurrence unexplainable by the police, ambulance, or anyone else. 

Most of the epileptic episodes ended, and people returned to normalcy. Sadly, some of the older victims, like the priest, passed away.

\*\*\*

I’m in my late thirties now.

And although you may not believe me. That story is true.

My whole life I’ve been living in fear. Horrified by the idea of encountering mad Uncle Ross yet again. 

He was said to have lost his mind amongst academic circles, spending his last year at CERN on probation for ‘equipment abuse’. People had reportedly seen him shoot high powered UV lasers into his temples. He became obsessed with something called “*Particle Decoherence”—* a theory that was thoroughly debunked as impossible.

I’ve seen him in nightmares. 

I’ve seen him in bathroom reflections. 

Sometimes I can feel his icy cold breath on my neck. 

I’ve seriously been worried almost every day of my life that he’s going to reappear again at some large group gathering and cause havoc. 

But thankfully that hasn’t happened. Not yet.

However, I have a feeling it will happen again soon. You see, yesterday I had a visitor.

\*\*\*

Although graying and blind in one eye, I still recognized Leopold from all those years ago. 

He came out of the blue, with a package at my apartment, and said that there had been a discovery regarding my late uncle.

“It was an old basement room, hidden behind a wall,” Leopold said. “The only reason we discovered it was because the facility was undergoing renovations.”

He lifted a small cardboard box and placed it on my kitchen counter. 

“We don't know how it's possible. But we discovered your uncle's skeleton inside.”

I blinked. “What?”

“A skeleton wearing Ross’ old uniform and name tag anyway. He was inside some kind of *makeshift* *cryogenic machine.* The rats had long ago broken in. Gnawed him to the bone.”

He swiveled the box to me and undid a flap. 

“I was visiting town and wanted to say hello to your mother. But after discovering this, I thought I should visit you first.”

I emptied the box's contents, discovered a small cotton cap with many ends. Like a Jester's cap. It looked like it was fashioned for the head of a small child. *Perhaps an 8-year-old boy.* 

“As I'm sure you know, your uncle was not *well of mind* in his final months at Geneva. We could all see it happening. He was advised to see many therapists … I don't believe he did.”

I rotated the cap in my hands, hearing the little bells jingle on each tassel.

“But I knew he always liked you. He spoke highly of his nephew.”

I looked into Leopold's remaining colored eye. “He did? Why?”

“Oh I think he saw you as a symbol of the next generation. That whatever he discovered could be passed down to you as a next of kin. That's my sense of it.”

There was a bit of black stitching on the front of the red cap. Pretty cursive letters. I stretched out the fabric.

“I don't know what he meant with this gift, but we found it within his cobwebbed and dilapidated ‘machine’. I feel certain he wanted you to have it.”

I read the whole phrase. 

*You and I versus the world kid.*

I bit my lip. A razorwire of fear coiled around my throat. I swallowed it away.

“So how did you find his skeleton at CERN? Didn't we already bury his body a long time ago?”

Leopold folded up the empty cardboard box with his pale old fingers.

“Your uncle was an enigma his whole life. No one knew why he jumped into that reactor 30 years ago.” Leo walked back to my doorway, I could tell that the topic was not a comfortable one to discuss. 

“I’ve spent a notable portion of my life trying to figure out what your uncle was thinking. But it's led me nowhere. His theory of *Particle Decoherence* was sadly proven false.”

I wanted to offer Leopold a coffee or something, he had only just arrived, but he was already wrapping his scarf back around his neck.

“Hey, you don't have to leave just yet…”

Some kind of heavy weight fell upon Leopold. Something too dark to explain. He took a few deep breaths and then, quite abruptly, grabbed both of my shoulders.

“He wanted you to have it okay. Just take it. Take the cap.""

“What?”

“Whatever you do Jacob, just stay *away* from him! If you see him again, *run*! Don't look at him. Don't talk to him. Don't pay him any attention!”

“Wait, wait, Leopold, what are you—”

“Your uncle is supposed to be *dead,* Jacob. And no matter what promises you, he’s lying. Your uncle is supposed to be dead! HE’S SUPPOSED TO BE GODDAMN [DEAD!](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/comments/1g0837r/welcome/)”",2,1746720051.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Don: Hello and welcome to the Duttering Don show featuring Jonnie Jonnerson. Skoal!

 

Jonnie: What are we doing today Don?

 

Don: Same thing we do everyday for the past year Jonnie, we talk about Trump. And I get drunk and spill shit on myself.

 

Jonnie: that reminds me of a time when I accidentally spilled purple Kool-aid on the carpet and Lamar rubbed my face in the carpet and said, “Bad Jonnie” and I had rug burns on my face and a bully at school was like what was I doing munching carpet or something and I was like, “yah.” We laughed and laughed about that.

 

Don: Anyway, I guess I need another Koors. 

 

*Ding dong. There is a knock at the door.*

 

Don: who the hell is it?

 

Jonnie: I don’t know maybe the tax collector or an encyclopedia salesman like my dad or something.

 

*Don gets up to see out the window.*

 

Don: oh it’s some guy with a case of beer. I better get it. But only if it’s free.

Jonnie: Daddy?

 

Don answers the door.

 

Don: who the hell are you? I didn’t order anything. I’m calling the police.

 

Dasher: hello I have this case of beer for you. A mr. Maloonagin door dashed it to this address.

 

Don: the hell they did! FUCKING HELL. I didn’t even..,wait is it paid for?

 

Dasher: yes.

 

Don: well I’ll take it then but I’m going to speak with your boss about this. I didn’t order it! I’m famous!

 

*Dasher drops case and leaves*.

 

*Don comes back in with the case of beer.*

 

Don: you believe this shite Jonnie?

 

Jonnie: A free case o beer? What did you win the drunk lottery or something? I can’t drink ever since my ma used to beat me with a beer can for wiping my nose on the curtains. She used to hammer my head flat like a flat iron pancake or something.

 

Don: in that case, more for me. Do do do.

 

 

 

**Don (cracking open a beer from the case): Free beer, Jonnie! This is better than the time I found a half-eaten hot dog in the park.**

**Jonnie: Reminds me of when Lamar tried to make me eat a moldy bologna sandwich ‘cause I forgot to salute the flag during recess. Said it was “patriotic protein.” Tasted like old gym socks and bleach.**

**Don (chugging): You and your damn stories, Jonnie. Anyway, let’s get to the main event—Trump talk! So, you think he’s gonna build a wall around the moon next or what?**

**Jonnie: I dunno, Don. Maybe he’ll make the moon pay for it. Like how Lamar made me pay for breaking his lava lamp when I was cleaning his garage with my toothbrush. Took me three weeks and I smelled like motor oil and cocoa butter.**

**Don (burps): Moon wall, huh? That’s a new one. (pauses, looks at the beer case) Wait a minute, Jonnie. This beer’s got a note taped to it. (picks up a crumpled piece of paper)**

**Jonnie: A note? What’s it say? Is it a love letter? Once, a girl at school left me a love letter that said, “Stop staring at me you homo,” and I cried for a week.**

**Don (reading): “Dear Don, enjoy the brew. You’re gonna need it when you hear Trump’s latest tweet storm. Signed, Anonymous Fan.” (scoffs) Tweet storm? I ain’t got time for that X nonsense. I’m a TV star!**

**Jonnie: Anonymous Fan? Sounds like a spy. Like when Lamar thought I was a secret agent ‘cause I hid his car keys in the toaster. He chased me with a plunger for an hour. I got splinters where the sun don’t shine.**

**Don (slamming the beer down): Spy or not, this is suspicious. Free beer? Notes? Next thing you know, we’re on some reality show called** ***Drunk and Confused*****! (pauses) Actually, that sounds like our show already.**

**Jonnie: Maybe it’s a prank! Like when I put hot ghost pepper sauce in Lamar’s coffee and he screamed so loud the neighbors called the cops. They thought he was auditioning for a horror movie or something. My Ma drew me a pepper sauce bath after that and it burned my genitals.**

**Don (grinning): Prank, huh? Alright, Jonnie, here’s the plan. We drink this whole case, then we track down this “Anonymous Fan” and give ‘em a piece of our mind. Or at least a piece of my fist. (hiccup) I went to the gym this week.**

**Jonnie: I’m in! But if we’re tracking someone, I need my detective hat. It’s the one Lamar threw in the trash after I used it to catch a raccoon. Smells like mystery and rabies.**

**Don (raises a beer): To mystery, rabies, and Trump talk! Let’s make this show legendary!**

**Jonnie: And to free beer! (pauses) But I’m still not drinking. Ma’s ghost would whack me with a spectral can.**

**Don (laughs): Fine, more for me. (to the camera) Tune in next time, folks, when we solve the Case of the Magic Beer or pass out trying! Skoal!**

**Jonnie: Skoal! (whispers) What’s a skoal?**

Uncle Ross.

Somehow he was alive and well, standing near the back, wearing a black suit, and beaming with his typical Cheshire cat smile. 

The very same Uncle Ross who was lying in the open casket by the dais.

I grabbed my mother’s arm and whispered. “Do you see him?”

“Huh?”

“Uncle *Ross*! Over there.”

“Not now Jacob.”

No one else in the church seemed remotely aware that the living dead were among them. The focus was on the sermon.

“We gather here today in love, sorrow, and remembrance…” the priest began.

When I looked back, Uncle Ross was sitting a row closer than before. He tugged at his peppery beard and looked at me with his wild green eyes. “*Hey Jakey!”*

Unwittingly, I let out a scream. 

The priest paused. Everyone looked at me. My mother grabbed me by the shoulder.

“Jacob what’s wrong?”

“I… Can’t you see him?”

“See *who*?”

Everyone gave me the side-eye, clearly perturbed by the spasm of a young boy. No one seemed to notice the obviously visible, smiling Uncle Ross amidst the crowd.

I pointed to where I saw him, standing three pews down.

“Uncle Ross…” I said, half-whispering, half-confused.

My mother glanced back, and shook her head. She grabbed my hand with a stern look. “Are you going to behave?”

Everyone was looking at where I had pointed to. No one appeared to notice Uncle Ross. 

But I could see him.

In fact, my uncle smiled at me, looked around himself and shrugged in a joking way, as if to say: *Uncle Ross, haven't seen him!*

I turned and closed my eyes. *There was no way this was happening. There was no way this was happening.* 

I focused on the priest, on the old, warbly, tenor of his voice.

“... A grandson, brother and a lifelong employee of *CERN*, our dearly departed made several significant contributions in his life. He had, as many said, ‘a brilliant mind’, and always lit up any room he was in...”

I grit my teeth and glanced back. 

Uncle Ross was gone. 

In his spot: empty air. 

And then a callused grip touched on my wrist. I looked up. Uncle Ross sitting beside me. 

A single finger on his lips. *“Shh.”*

A moment ago the spot beside me was bare, and now my uncle smiled, giggling through his teeth.

Fear froze me stiff.

“Just pretend I'm not here, Jakey. Don't mind me any mind.”

My mother hadn't turned an inch. She was ignoring me and watching the priest.

“Isn’t it funny?” Uncle Ross chuckled. He was speaking on a wavelength that clearly only I could hear. “All these clodpoles think I’m dead. They think I’m *dead* Jakey! But that's not my real body. No, no. That's just the duplicate. That's just the decoy.”

I turned away from this ghost and kept my eyes on the priest. I didn't know what was happening. But I knew it *wasn't supposed to be* *happening*.

“I chose you on purpose, Jakey. You were the youngest. It had to be you.”

My uncle's breath felt icy on my ear.

My whole neck was seizing up.

“You’ll be the one to turn on **the machine** in fifty years. That's all I need you to do. Turn on **the machine** in 2044. I’ll tell you more when the time comes.”

He cleared his throat and patted my right knee. My entire lower body seized up too.

Uncle Ross left his seat and walked out into the front aisle. 

“You and I versus the world, kid! Now how about we make this funeral memorable huh?” Uncle Ross grinned. “Let's commemorate a little.”

He walked up onto the dais and stood right next to the reverend.

“…Although we lost him in an unfortunate accident. His warmth, his influence, and of course, his scientific contributions will live on for many decades to come…”

Uncle Ross lifted his hand, made a fist, and then calmly *phased* it through the priest's head. It's as if my uncle was a *hologram.*

Then Uncle Ross’ pudgy two fingers poked out of the priest’s eyes—as if the priest was being gouged from the inside. The pudgy fingers wiggled and swam around the old man’s entire scalp.

The holy father froze. 

A glazed look befell his eyes. 

Silence in the church.

Everyone's breath stopped.

“Father Remy, is everything—?”

The priest collapsed to the floor, flipping and contorting violently. The seizure made him roll, spasm, and audibly tear ligaments.

“Oh my goodness!”

“Someone help!”

A thin man in a tweed suit stepped out from the front—someone from Uncle Ross’ work. 

The tweed man cleared all of the fallen candles off the stage, and sat beside the spasming reverend, protecting the old man's arms from hitting the podium.

“And look there Jakey!” Uncle Ross hunched over, standing overtop of the tweed man. “That’s Leopold! Look at him, such a good samaritan.”

My uncle pointed at Leopold's head.

“This colleague of mine was the only one smart enough to understand my work. He *knew* what I was trying to accomplish in particle physics … “

Uncle Ross walked over, his legs phasing through the struggling priest, and then squatted right beside his colleague. 

“And now, he shall know no more.”

My Uncle wrapped Leopold in a bear hug, phasing into his entire head and torso. The back of my uncle's head was superimposed over Leopold's shocked face. 

Blood gushed out of Leopold’s nose. He fell and joined the priest, seizuring violently on the stage.

“Dear God!”

“Leo!”

Everyone stared at the dais. There were now two convulsing men whipping their arms back and forth, smacking themselves into the podium. 

My mom moved to help, but I yanked her back.

“No! Get away!”

“Jacob, what are you—?”

*“AAAAAHHH!!”* 

My aunt’s scream was deafening.

She watched in horror as her husband *also* fell.  He rolled in the aisle, frothed at the mouth and joined the contagious seizure spreading throughout the church.

My uncle stood above him, laughing. “Flopping like fish!”

I tugged with inhuman strength, that’s how my mother always described it, *inhumane strength.* I pulled us both down between the pews, and out the back of the church.

After dragging my mom into the parking lot, I screamed repeatedly to *“Open the car and drive! Drive! Drive! Drive!*

My heart was in pure panic.

I remember staring out the back seat of my mom’s speeding Honda, watching my uncle casually phase through funeral attendees, leaving a trail of writhing and frothing epileptics.

As our car turned away, my uncle cupped around his mouth and yelled, “Remember Jakey! You’ll be the one to turn on **the machine!** You’ll be the one to bring me back!”

\*\*\*

I was eight years old when that incident happened. 

Eight.

Of course no one believed me. And my mother attributed my wild imagination to the trauma of the event. 

It was described as a “mass psychogenic illness”. A freak occurrence unexplainable by the police, ambulance, or anyone else. 

Most of the epileptic episodes ended, and people returned to normalcy. Sadly, some of the older victims, like the priest, passed away.

\*\*\*

I’m in my late thirties now.

And although you may not believe me. That story is true.

My whole life I’ve been living in fear. Horrified by the idea of encountering mad Uncle Ross yet again. 

He was said to have lost his mind amongst academic circles, spending his last year at CERN on probation for ‘equipment abuse’. People had reportedly seen him shoot high powered UV lasers into his temples. He became obsessed with something called “*Particle Decoherence”—* a theory that was thoroughly debunked as impossible.

I’ve seen him in nightmares. 

I’ve seen him in bathroom reflections. 

Sometimes I can feel his icy cold breath on my neck. 

I’ve seriously been worried almost every day of my life that he’s going to reappear again at some large group gathering and cause havoc. 

But thankfully that hasn’t happened. Not yet.

However, I have a feeling it will happen again soon. You see, yesterday I had a visitor.

\*\*\*

Although graying and blind in one eye, I still recognized Leopold from all those years ago. 

He came out of the blue, with a package at my apartment, and said that there had been a discovery regarding my late uncle.

“It was an old basement room, hidden behind a wall,” Leopold said. “The only reason we discovered it was because the facility was undergoing renovations.”

He lifted a small cardboard box and placed it on my kitchen counter. 

“We don't know how it's possible. But we discovered your uncle's skeleton inside.”

I blinked. “What?”

“A skeleton wearing Ross’ old uniform and name tag anyway. He was inside some kind of *makeshift* *cryogenic machine.* The rats had long ago broken in. Gnawed him to the bone.”

He swiveled the box to me and undid a flap. 

“I was visiting town and wanted to say hello to your mother. But after discovering this, I thought I should visit you first.”

I emptied the box's contents, discovered a small cotton cap with many ends. Like a Jester's cap. It looked like it was fashioned for the head of a small child. *Perhaps an 8-year-old boy.* 

“As I'm sure you know, your uncle was not *well of mind* in his final months at Geneva. We could all see it happening. He was advised to see many therapists … I don't believe he did.”

I rotated the cap in my hands, hearing the little bells jingle on each tassel.

“But I knew he always liked you. He spoke highly of his nephew.”

I looked into Leopold's remaining colored eye. “He did? Why?”

“Oh I think he saw you as a symbol of the next generation. That whatever he discovered could be passed down to you as a next of kin. That's my sense of it.”

There was a bit of black stitching on the front of the red cap. Pretty cursive letters. I stretched out the fabric.

“I don't know what he meant with this gift, but we found it within his cobwebbed and dilapidated ‘machine’. I feel certain he wanted you to have it.”

I read the whole phrase. 

*You and I versus the world kid.*

I bit my lip. A razorwire of fear coiled around my throat. I swallowed it away.

“So how did you find his skeleton at CERN? Didn't we already bury his body a long time ago?”

Leopold folded up the empty cardboard box with his pale old fingers.

“Your uncle was an enigma his whole life. No one knew why he jumped into that reactor 30 years ago.” Leo walked back to my doorway, I could tell that the topic was not a comfortable one to discuss. 

“I’ve spent a notable portion of my life trying to figure out what your uncle was thinking. But it's led me nowhere. His theory of *Particle Decoherence* was sadly proven false.”

I wanted to offer Leopold a coffee or something, he had only just arrived, but he was already wrapping his scarf back around his neck.

“Hey, you don't have to leave just yet…”

Some kind of heavy weight fell upon Leopold. Something too dark to explain. He took a few deep breaths and then, quite abruptly, grabbed both of my shoulders.

“He wanted you to have it okay. Just take it. Take the cap.""

“What?”

“Whatever you do Jacob, just stay *away* from him! If you see him again, *run*! Don't look at him. Don't talk to him. Don't pay him any attention!”

“Wait, wait, Leopold, what are you—”

“Your uncle is supposed to be *dead,* Jacob. And no matter what promises you, he’s lying. Your uncle is supposed to be dead! HE’S SUPPOSED TO BE GODDAMN DEAD!""",1,1746720006.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

And what's more, most of the time, these people keep their shoes, their sneakers and cross them on the coffee table.
Personally, I find it very rude and dirty, I find it a lack of education and cleanliness.
What's the point of doing that? A coffee table is not made to put your feet on it and even less so with your shoes!
A coffee table is made for eating, and putting objects and snacks on it, but certainly not for putting your feet on.

I (29F) have struggled with various symptoms of hypothyroidism over the past 5 years (since my last pregnancy), which include fatigue where I’m worn out by noon and need to nap, thin hair, difficulty losing weight when dieting and exercising, but easy time gaining weight, constipation, and the list goes on. Even with great amounts of sleep I still crash by noon and need multiple coffees to get through the day.

My doctor prescribed be phentermine (appetite suppressant) a few years ago, and it sort of worked but I gained the weight back (eating normal). My mom has Hashinotos, and I told my doctor that, but she wouldn’t do a blood panel. I finally found one that works and these are my results.

TSH: 4.7
FT4: 0.69
Vitamin D: 10
Iron: 34

From what I’ve read both my TSH and FT4 are normal-low or normal-high, and both my iron and vitamin d are not normal. When I asked to try hypothyroidism medication, she said I was completely normal and asked if I wanted higher distance phentermine instead. They would rather put me on a medication that gets my heart rate through the roof.

Are these tests normal? I tried callondoc to get a prescription online, but they said they only prescribe if TSH is over 5. I really need to find a solution, and my doctor is not trying to help me at all.

I just want to share my experience this past few months lang together with this guy na nakausap ko lang through social media. I do not know kung anong tawag ba if situationship or kabalewanship malala. 

At first, hindi ko napansin na inadd niya ako sa social after board exam last year (meaning matagal ko na pala siyang friend sa fb) and upon stalking him sa soc med, nalaman ko na same din kami ng major. Napansin ko siya nitong December lang dahil nag start siyang mag react sa mga posts and stories ko lalo na noong nakapasa ako sa board. I stalked his account and hindi siya gaanong pala post. Pero I saw him and his pictures and katropa niya pala yung mga kakilala ko rin way back noong jhs ako. 

Fast forward, last month lang, finally he decided to approach and messaged me. At first okay naman ang conversation namin, we introduced ourselves and nalaman ko na same school pala kami from jhs to shs. Ahead lang siya sa akin ng 1 year. He loves coffee, animals,  music, walking/jogging, spontaneous trips, food trip, and adventures the reason why we shared some interests. Marunong din siya sa mga sports. 

Days passed by and mas lalo ko siyang nakikilala. We update each other kung saan pupunta, kung mabubusy sa work, kung may gala with tropas and partida with pictures pa yan. Then one day, he asked me if puwede kaming lumabas after his duty sa work and church niya.. pero that time hindi ako puwede dahil may lakad din ako after ng church ko and gusto ko kasi na magpahinga muna siya pagkauwi niya. Kinagabihan noon ay nag outing siya together with his cousins ata. Forda update pa yan siya talaga kahit madaling araw na. Inantay ko pa nga siyang makauwi dahil naka motor lang siya. Kinaumagahan, nagpadala siya sa workplace ko ng food. Nakakagulat syempre kasi hindi ko naman sinabi sa kanya yung address ng workplace ko or even my exact home address then may paganon siya. Kinilig ako ng slight of course kasi sino ba naman ako para pagkagastusan hahaha. 

Every day kami nag-uusap. Walang palya yan. Alam ko na nga rin pati ang schedule niya. One time lumabas ako with my college friends para makipag kwentuhan at mag walking. Halos 10PM na noong pauwi na kami, at bigla siyang nagmessage na nandoon din pala siya sa place  with his friends naman para magkape and mag unwind. Kaya pala panay tanong siya if anong oras ako uuwi pero ang sabi ko ay hindi ko alam dahil kasama ko pa ang mga kaibigan ko. Sayang daw at hindi niya ako nakita..

Dumaan ang ilang days pa and nag try akong iask siya if gusto niya bang lumabas or mag kape. Pero sometimes, hindi akma ang schedule namin dahil may work din siya and minsan nag wawalking sila with friends niya, tho magkalapit lang naman talaga ang mga bahay namin dahil nasa iisa kaming lugar. 

May mga times na pinahahapyawan ko thru chat na if may gusto ba siya sa akin or crush ba niya ako. Pero the way ye answered it, parang pabiro. Minsan niloloko niya pa ako na bf ko raw siya pero kumokontra ako dahil ayokong makuha niya ako ng ganun lang, maghirap siya please lang.

Dumating na sa point na nagsasabi na siya sa akin ng miss you (nickname ko) and love you (nickname ko). For me, napaka big deal na nito sa akin, lalo na kung wala kaming label. I confronted him and ang sabi ko na ayokong magsabi siya sa akin ng ganun lalo na kung hindi genuine. I even gave him signs na i like him pero kailangan niya kasing manligaw. I do not want that kind of situation na walang label pero magsasabihan ng ganoon.

After 3 weeks of getting to know him, I decided to confront him about his intentions to me if gusto niya ba ng tropa or trip trip lang talaga. Ayaw ko kasi na nag ooverthink ako tapos hindi naman pala kami same page. Nag sorry pa nga ako dahil sabi ko na coconfused na ako. I even said na nirerespect ko siya and sana ganun din siya sa akin. 

Pero after that, wala ng bakas niya ang nagpakita. Seen lang. Walang response. Walang react. Hindi na rin niya tinitignan or vinuview ang stories ko. Friends pa rin sa social media pero parang wala na lang. 

Sometimes napapaisip ako, mali ba ako? Until now iyon pa rin ang kina oover think ko. 
Pero at the back of my mind, I know my worth eh, bakit hindi niya ako ipursue? 

Literal na minumulto ako. Umaasa pa rin talaga! Tinatry kong mag move forward, pero ang hirap grabe! 

Paalala: Please lang, huwag niyong iaapproach ang tao or pakitaan ng motibo kung wala kayong intention na seryosohin siya. Tumatanda na tayo mga ninjas! Hindi na tayo para sa laro-laro lang.

This sleek, semi-automatic espresso machine arrived at my doorstep, and it felt like unwrapping a gift tailored specifically for coffee aficionados. With its brushed stainless steel finish and a modern design, it has become the centerpiece of my kitchen. Easy to set up, within a few short moments, I found myself holding a cup of latte art that looked like it came straight out of a trendy café.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The robust brushed stainless steel body of this machine is both aesthetic and practical. It gives off a premium vibe and is resistant to dirt, making it surprisingly easy to clean. The compact size works well in my relatively crowded countertop space, and yet, it holds a 1.8L water tank—enough capacity to dodge frequent refills. The cup warmer on the top? That's a thoughtful feature I didn't know I needed. Starting my day with warmed espresso cups feels downright luxurious.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Heavy-duty build ensures durability.  
- Compact yet equipped with an ample 1.8L removable tank.  
- Cup warmer improves the coffee experience.

[Check HiBREW H10A price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ddtg7ddm/)

**Performance and Versatility**  
This espresso machine boasts up to 20-bar pressure coupled with uniform moist pre-infusion. The result? Every shot I’ve pulled has been rich, full-bodied, and topped with a velvety crema. Whether I’m brewing a cappuccino for my partner, an iced americano for myself, or even a silky latte for guests, the programmable functions let me customize every brew to the tee. And trust me, I’ve tinkered with all the settings—adjusted extraction temperatures between 194°F to 204°F, played around with steam temperature, and even explored the pre-infusion times. This level of control feels deeply satisfying.  

**Steam Wand Experience**  
The 270° rotating steam wand deserves a shout-out. I’ve used it to create consistently dense milk froth that elevates my lattes and cappuccinos. While I’m no latte art champion, this powerful steam system makes me feel like one. The detachable steam head is another thoughtful aspect—it’s absolutely hassle-free to clean, avoiding any milk buildup or corrosion.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Steam nozzle, though detachable, requires extra care during cleaning.  
- Unit operation can feel slightly noisy during extraction.  

**Programming Options**  
From 25ml single-shot espresso to 300ml double shots, the programmable range is exceptional. This also extends to coffee flavor settings—if you’ve got beans with distinct tasting notes, the temperature and setting adjustments extract every nuance. I’ve experimented with lighter roasts, darker ones, and everything in between, and the machine performs consistently.  

**Thermo Coil System**  
With its stainless steel thermo coil design, this machine excels in temperature stability and avoids rusting—an underrated feature I wish more machines had. Stability is critical for flavor and consistency, particularly over consecutive shots.  

**Peer Products**  
Compared to the Gaggia Classic Pro and Breville Bambino Plus, this HiBREW espresso machine stands out with its unbeatable combination of versatility and price. The Gaggia offers slightly more robust build quality, but lacks as many advanced programmability options. The Bambino, while compact and quick, doesn’t provide the same level of functionality for hardcore espresso lovers. The HiBREW H10A comfortably bridges the gap between serious espresso enthusiasts and those looking for a semi-affordable upgrade for their home setups.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Considering the plethora of features, adaptability, and performance, this espresso machine offers excellent bang for the buck. It’s a pocket-pleasant alternative to premium competitors and has already helped me save loads compared to my Starbucks indulgences. It’s not just an appliance; it’s an investment in flavor and convenience.

1khtgrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1khtgrf/does_the_dowan_pour_over_coffee_maker_redefine/,Does the DOWAN Pour Over Coffee Maker Redefine Your Brewing Experience Review?,"There’s something oddly satisfying about the simplicity of brewing coffee manually. As a coffee enthusiast who loves to explore new ways of enhancing my morning java, I was intrigued when I got my hands on the **DOWAN SUVELAM Pour Over Coffee Maker**. It’s touted as a compact, manual brewer for coffee aficionados, which seemed to make it perfect for those seeking a more personal brewing experience without the buzz of electric machines. After weeks of testing it, here’s my take on what works, what doesn’t, and more.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing I noticed was the sleek, modern design. The glossy white ceramic material makes it both beautiful and practical. It’s compact enough to fit snugly in the kitchen cabinet, but stylish enough that I wouldn’t mind leaving it on the countertop for guests to marvel at. The high-fired ceramic construction kept my coffee hotter longer than expected, and frankly, I appreciated the robustness of its build. Unlike some fragile brewers I’ve tried before, this one feels durable and well-made. However, the surface gets slightly warm after extended use, so handling it with care isn’t a bad idea.

**Thoughtful Features**

What sets this pour-over coffee maker apart is its innovative design elements. The three-hole dripping system not only allows for a well-controlled coffee flow but also ensures optimal brewing time for extracting maximum flavor. On mornings when I needed a strong cup to kickstart my day, I noticed how consistent the flavor was. The inner wall vertical rib helps maintain a gap between the filter paper and coffee maker, ensuring even water distribution and better extraction. It’s clear a lot of thought has gone into making this product ideal for slow-brew enthusiasts like myself.

[Check DOWAN SUVELAM price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07rt4s7k9/)

**Performance and User Experience**

Brewing coffee using this pour-over dripper felt like a small, meditative ritual. From setting the filter paper to pouring the water evenly over finely ground beans, it required a bit of focus but delivered pure satisfaction. The V-shaped conical design works well to compact the grounds, effectively promoting even steeping. That being said, keep in mind that filter paper is not included. This felt like a minor inconvenience when I initially set up the product, but it gave me the flexibility to pick my preferred filter brand.

One limitation I discovered is that the three-hole drip could slow down the process a bit if you’re in a rush. This isn’t necessarily a defect—it’s designed for the pouring process to take its time—but it’s something to note for anyone wanting speed over flavor perfection.

**Strengths**

- The high-gloss ceramic material offers excellent heat retention.  
- Innovative three-hole drip system delivers flavorful, aromatic coffee.  
- Compact and lightweight; perfect for camping or traveling.  
- Vertical ribs inside ensure balanced coffee extraction.  

**Areas of Improvement**

- Filter paper isn’t provided, so you’ll need to source it separately.  
- The brewing process may feel slow for those short on time.  

**Competitive Options**

Comparing this to some other pour-over coffee makers—like Hario’s V60, which also boasts a conical design—it’s clear that the SUVELAM model tries to match premium brewers while staying more accessible. While Hario offers unmatched precision, the DOWAN SUVELAM edges ahead in affordability and aesthetic appeal. On the other hand, Chemex glass brewers shine in their versatility, capable of preparing multiple servings, whereas this ceramic dripper is better for single or double cups.

For frequent travelers or campers, this product definitely outclasses larger electric options from brands like Keurig or Nespresso in portability and simplicity. However, those dependent on convenience may still gravitate toward plug-and-play models.

**Affordable Quality**

As far as price-to-quality ratio goes, it delivers exceptional value. It feels like a premium product minus the hefty price tag that’s often associated with high-end coffee gear. The durable build, combined with a design focused on bringing out every hint of flavor in the beans, suggests a lot of care has been invested in its creation. You’re paying for simplicity done well, which—in my opinion—makes it worth every penny for coffee enthusiasts.

Uncle Ross.

Somehow he was alive and well, standing near the back, wearing a black suit, and beaming with his typical Cheshire cat smile. 

The very same Uncle Ross who was lying in the open casket by the dais.

I grabbed my mother’s arm and whispered. “Do you see him?”

“Huh?”

“Uncle *Ross*! Over there.”

“Not now Jacob.”

No one else in the church seemed remotely aware that the living dead were among them. The focus was on the sermon.

“We gather here today in love, sorrow, and remembrance…” the priest began.

When I looked back, Uncle Ross was sitting a row closer than before. He tugged at his peppery beard and looked at me with his wild green eyes. “*Hey Jakey!”*

Unwittingly, I let out a scream. 

The priest paused. Everyone looked at me. My mother grabbed me by the shoulder.

“Jacob what’s wrong?”

“I… Can’t you see him?”

“See *who*?”

Everyone gave me the side-eye, clearly perturbed by the spasm of a young boy. No one seemed to notice the obviously visible, smiling Uncle Ross amidst the crowd.

I pointed to where I saw him, standing three pews down.

“Uncle Ross…” I said, half-whispering, half-confused.

My mother glanced back, and shook her head. She grabbed my hand with a stern look. “Are you going to behave?”

Everyone was looking at where I had pointed to. No one appeared to notice Uncle Ross. 

But I could see him.

In fact, my uncle smiled at me, looked around himself and shrugged in a joking way, as if to say: *Uncle Ross, haven't seen him!*

I turned and closed my eyes. *There was no way this was happening. There was no way this was happening.* 

I focused on the priest, on the old, warbly, tenor of his voice.

“... A grandson, brother and a lifelong employee of *CERN*, our dearly departed made several significant contributions in his life. He had, as many said, ‘a brilliant mind’, and always lit up any room he was in...”

I grit my teeth and glanced back. 

Uncle Ross was gone. 

In his spot: empty air. 

And then a callused grip touched on my wrist. I looked up. Uncle Ross sitting beside me. 

A single finger on his lips. *“Shh.”*

A moment ago the spot beside me was bare, and now my uncle smiled, giggling through his teeth.

Fear froze me stiff.

“Just pretend I'm not here, Jakey. Don't mind me any mind.”

My mother hadn't turned an inch. She was ignoring me and watching the priest.

“Isn’t it funny?” Uncle Ross chuckled. He was speaking on a wavelength that clearly only I could hear. “All these clodpoles think I’m dead. They think I’m *dead* Jakey! But that's not my real body. No, no. That's just the duplicate. That's just the decoy.”

I turned away from this ghost and kept my eyes on the priest. I didn't know what was happening. But I knew it *wasn't supposed to be* *happening*.

“I chose you on purpose, Jakey. You were the youngest. It had to be you.”

My uncle's breath felt icy on my ear.

My whole neck was seizing up.

“You’ll be the one to turn on **the machine** in fifty years. That's all I need you to do. Turn on **the machine** in 2044. I’ll tell you more when the time comes.”

He cleared his throat and patted my right knee. My entire lower body seized up too.

Uncle Ross left his seat and walked out into the front aisle. 

“You and I versus the world, kid! Now how about we make this funeral memorable huh?” Uncle Ross grinned. “Let's commemorate a little.”

He walked up onto the dais and stood right next to the reverend.

“…Although we lost him in an unfortunate accident. His warmth, his influence, and of course, his scientific contributions will live on for many decades to come…”

Uncle Ross lifted his hand, made a fist, and then calmly *phased* it through the priest's head. It's as if my uncle was a *hologram.*

Then Uncle Ross’ pudgy two fingers poked out of the priest’s eyes—as if the priest was being gouged from the inside. The pudgy fingers wiggled and swam around the old man’s entire scalp.

The holy father froze. 

A glazed look befell his eyes. 

Silence in the church.

Everyone's breath stopped.

“Father Remy, is everything—?”

The priest collapsed to the floor, flipping and contorting violently. The seizure made him roll, spasm, and audibly tear ligaments.

“Oh my goodness!”

“Someone help!”

A thin man in a tweed suit stepped out from the front—someone from Uncle Ross’ work. 

The tweed man cleared all of the fallen candles off the stage, and sat beside the spasming reverend, protecting the old man's arms from hitting the podium.

“And look there Jakey!” Uncle Ross hunched over, standing overtop of the tweed man. “That’s Leopold! Look at him, such a good samaritan.”

My uncle pointed at Leopold's head.

“This colleague of mine was the only one smart enough to understand my work. He *knew* what I was trying to accomplish in particle physics … “

Uncle Ross walked over, his legs phasing through the struggling priest, and then squatted right beside his colleague. 

“And now, he shall know no more.”

My Uncle wrapped Leopold in a bear hug, phasing into his entire head and torso. The back of my uncle's head was superimposed over Leopold's shocked face. 

Blood gushed out of Leopold’s nose. He fell and joined the priest, seizuring violently on the stage.

“Dear God!”

“Leo!”

Everyone stared at the dais. There were now two convulsing men whipping their arms back and forth, smacking themselves into the podium. 

My mom moved to help, but I yanked her back.

“No! Get away!”

“Jacob, what are you—?”

*“AAAAAHHH!!”* 

My aunt’s scream was deafening.

She watched in horror as her husband *also* fell.  He rolled in the aisle, frothed at the mouth and joined the contagious seizure spreading throughout the church.

My uncle stood above him, laughing. “Flopping like fish!”

I tugged with inhuman strength, that’s how my mother always described it, *inhumane strength.* I pulled us both down between the pews, and out the back of the church.

After dragging my mom into the parking lot, I screamed repeatedly to *“Open the car and drive! Drive! Drive! Drive!*

My heart was in pure panic.

I remember staring out the back seat of my mom’s speeding Honda, watching my uncle casually phase through funeral attendees, leaving a trail of writhing and frothing epileptics.

As our car turned away, my uncle cupped around his mouth and yelled, “Remember Jakey! You’ll be the one to turn on **the machine!** You’ll be the one to bring me back!”

\*\*\*

I was eight years old when that incident happened. 

Eight.

Of course no one believed me. And my mother attributed my wild imagination to the trauma of the event. 

It was described as a “mass psychogenic illness”. A freak occurrence unexplainable by the police, ambulance, or anyone else. 

Most of the epileptic episodes ended, and people returned to normalcy. Sadly, some of the older victims, like the priest, passed away.

\*\*\*

I’m in my late thirties now.

And although you may not believe me. That story is true.

My whole life I’ve been living in fear. Horrified by the idea of encountering mad Uncle Ross yet again. 

He was said to have lost his mind amongst academic circles, spending his last year at CERN on probation for ‘equipment abuse’. People had reportedly seen him shoot high powered UV lasers into his temples. He became obsessed with something called “*Particle Decoherence”—* a theory that was thoroughly debunked as impossible.

I’ve seen him in nightmares. 

I’ve seen him in bathroom reflections. 

Sometimes I can feel his icy cold breath on my neck. 

I’ve seriously been worried almost every day of my life that he’s going to reappear again at some large group gathering and cause havoc. 

But thankfully that hasn’t happened. Not yet.

However, I have a feeling it will happen again soon. You see, yesterday I had a visitor.

\*\*\*

Although graying and blind in one eye, I still recognized Leopold from all those years ago. 

He came out of the blue, with a package at my apartment, and said that there had been a discovery regarding my late uncle.

“It was an old basement room, hidden behind a wall,” Leopold said. “The only reason we discovered it was because the facility was undergoing renovations.”

He lifted a small cardboard box and placed it on my kitchen counter. 

“We don't know how it's possible. But we discovered your uncle's skeleton inside.”

I blinked. “What?”

“A skeleton wearing Ross’ old uniform and name tag anyway. He was inside some kind of *makeshift* *cryogenic machine.* The rats had long ago broken in. Gnawed him to the bone.”

He swiveled the box to me and undid a flap. 

“I was visiting town and wanted to say hello to your mother. But after discovering this, I thought I should visit you first.”

I emptied the box's contents, discovered a small cotton cap with many ends. Like a Jester's cap. It looked like it was fashioned for the head of a small child. *Perhaps an 8-year-old boy.* 

“As I'm sure you know, your uncle was not *well of mind* in his final months at Geneva. We could all see it happening. He was advised to see many therapists … I don't believe he did.”

I rotated the cap in my hands, hearing the little bells jingle on each tassel.

“But I knew he always liked you. He spoke highly of his nephew.”

I looked into Leopold's remaining colored eye. “He did? Why?”

“Oh I think he saw you as a symbol of the next generation. That whatever he discovered could be passed down to you as a next of kin. That's my sense of it.”

There was a bit of black stitching on the front of the red cap. Pretty cursive letters. I stretched out the fabric.

“I don't know what he meant with this gift, but we found it within his cobwebbed and dilapidated ‘machine’. I feel certain he wanted you to have it.”

I read the whole phrase. 

*You and I versus the world kid.*

I bit my lip. A razorwire of fear coiled around my throat. I swallowed it away.

“So how did you find his skeleton at CERN? Didn't we already bury his body a long time ago?”

Leopold folded up the empty cardboard box with his pale old fingers.

“Your uncle was an enigma his whole life. No one knew why he jumped into that reactor 30 years ago.” Leo walked back to my doorway, I could tell that the topic was not a comfortable one to discuss. 

“I’ve spent a notable portion of my life trying to figure out what your uncle was thinking. But it's led me nowhere. His theory of *Particle Decoherence* was sadly proven false.”

I wanted to offer Leopold a coffee or something, he had only just arrived, but he was already wrapping his scarf back around his neck.

“Hey, you don't have to leave just yet…”

Some kind of heavy weight fell upon Leopold. Something too dark to explain. He took a few deep breaths and then, quite abruptly, grabbed both of my shoulders.

“He wanted you to have it okay. Just take it. Take the cap.""

“What?”

“Whatever you do Jacob, just stay *away* from him! If you see him again, *run*! Don't look at him. Don't talk to him. Don't pay him any attention!”

“Wait, wait, Leopold, what are you—”

“Your uncle is supposed to be *dead,* Jacob. And no matter what promises you, he’s lying. Your uncle is supposed to be dead! HE’S SUPPOSED TO BE GODDAMN [DEAD!](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/comments/1g0837r/welcome/)”",8,1746719355.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

But first I’d like to start off by saying I’m not really a ”hater” or whatever and I’m not a fan either. These are just some observations I’ve made. That I’d like to discuss.

1. Okay here we go, I feel like if the Kalogera sisters were black(or any poc) they wouldn’t be as popular , and instead of being liked, they’d be hated. Not because of anything they’re doing in particular, but because of double standards amongst our society. Like let’s be fr, you’ve never seen

Oh and sense I know mega fans are lurking on here, since you are such a big fan, I’m hoping you know the girls have said their ethnic background is 100% Greek. Meaning they’re white(which there’s nothing wrong with). But let’s be fr, when’s one time you’ve seen people hyperfixate on a black girls natural hair. Or get called “brave for wearing bonnets in public, or get called ”funny or inspirational” for making s\*xual jokes. Most of these would get a black person to be immediately called “ghetto”. None of this is the sisters fault, but I feel like we could do better as people and stop the double standards.

2. Their growth in YouTube isnt the most natural. I just find it weird that compared to other creators who make the EXACT same content as them, they gained 2mil in under a year. Good for them but that’s a suspicious growth rate in my opinion. This isn’t me saying they aren’t popular at all or anything of the sort.

3. Lastly their fanbase is reminiscent of the K-pop stans, even though k-pop Stan’s are 100x worse. Here are some examples, changing your appearance to look more like your idol, noticing the smallest most UN-noteworthy things that they didn’t tell you, like what coffee flavor they always drink, ”oh she still has that scar from 367467 days ago“, or I dunno, WHERE THEIR FREAK’N HOUSE IS, lastly you aren’t allowed to criticze them at all, and if you allow a single bit of criticism, you getting kicked out of our cul-I mean religion, and black listed from every fan place, and are not a real fan. Again I don’t think it’s a bad, but it’s like if the k-pop stans adopted a child and raised it giving it a few of their personality traits.",3,1746719348.0,kalogerassnark,3,0.64,False

No games or innuendos, always respectful though. I have a female friend who says that is too intense and if a man approached her like that, she would not like it. For me, it feels honest. If I find someone attractive and interesting and I feel there's a vibe, then I express it and ask if she would want to meet up for a drink / coffee / dinner. 

What do you women say? Would you appreciate if a man approached you like that or would that uncomfortable?

1khte5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/1khte5o/need_help_dont_know_what_to_do/,Need help: Don’t know what to do.,"I tried going to my PCP a couple of times and have indicated to him about these symptoms. I've also asked about them to my urologist. But there's no use. Both just says diet and exercise. And I'm lost. So here is the issues I have. They're a mix of GI and Urinary. So I do not know.

1. I did hook up with a girl, and after that I got small bump (which looks like balanitis) on my penis. I used antifungal, and it went away. but the glans which used to be pink, is now has a reddish hue. 
2. slowly, the erections went away. and the penis stayed sore. even without masturbation. and a small urethral burning when I urinated. 
3. i explained these to the pcp and he ran some tests and said they couldn’t find anything. this was since 2013. he also did testosterone test and found it was 245 and said that’s normal. retrospectively thinking that’s low. 
4. Over time, I took Tylenol and such, and they help. but overall, I did not get my erections back. there’s always a pressure on the bladder- which I can feel from my lower abdomen. if I push a little on lower abdomen, the bladder seems to burn.
5. i did notice that at the same time my bowel movements changed. I have to strain or sometimes there’s leakage when i pass gas. 
6. I also noticed that sometimes the bowel doesn’t want to relax and I have to manually go inside the rectum and push the wall and the bowel movement happens freely for a min or so, and then the wall contracts again. I told this to gi doctor and he said I’m not probably drinking enough fluids. so I stayed off coffee for a week and drank water a lot- it helped, but not completely. I still suffer the same. 
7.  when I did push the wall, semen comes out. and it’s a lot of it. but after this, the bladder pressure is relieved. it takes a day or so, and the pressure returns.
8. doc performed a DRE for prostate and said it looks fine. but when I insert the finger i know the wall has a lot of pressure (like a balloon expanded) and when I push it’s hard or like pushing on rubber- it’s flexible and bounce back, but not like a sponge.
9. i started on viagra and noticed that my erections are limp. like when it’s not full. I got a Doppler test thinking it was a blood flow issue and the guy said the vessels look great.
10. I also got tested for Testosterone last year and found that I was low. in the 300’s. I began lifting weights and take supplements, but my libido and erections are still not back. I also have the unexplained burning in the urethra as well as glans sometimes and the bladder has pressure. 
11. I have thought maybe it’s cpps- and did the stretches, but it doesn’t really help.

  
so yeah- I need help. I don’t know where to start or what to do. any help is appreciated. ",1,1746719240.0,Prostatitis,0,1.0,False

1khtbh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamucil/comments/1khtbh5/addicted_for_life/,Addicted for life?,"I started taking Metamucil a few years ago on the advice of a friend of mine. I didn’t think I had any issues with bowel movements, but I guess I just didn’t realize how much better things could be. I wasn’t prone to constipation (which is what I thought Metamucil was for) just the opposite, I would have 4-5 bowel movements a day, often needing to go urgently, immediately after I had finished a meal. I think I just had no idea what healthy bowel movements looked, felt and smelled like.

The good: I take 4 tablespoons at night generally around 10:00pm (two of the stone ground unflavored mixed with two of the fine ground orange). More than the container advises, but what works for me and I make sure to drink 100oz or more of liquid daily. When I wake up in the morning, I will have a substantial soft, satisfying, clean wipe, bowel movement right after my coffee and then 1-3 more smaller but otherwise similar movements later in the morning. It’s wonderful, I don’t feel bloated and I always feel like I’ve completely emptied myself of the previous day’s meals. 

The bad: if I don’t take my Metamucil, the first day is generally not much different (I’m assuming it’s from the residual fiber in my system from taking it daily for so long). However, day 2 is terrible. Many, many, soft, unsatisfying, half-emptying, small, thank-god-for-the-bidet-or-I-would-never-get-clean, bowel movements as a best case scenario to oily diarrhea as a worst. Maybe I’m just not remembering how awful my pre-Metamucil days were, but it seems like when I don’t take it, I’m substantially worse off than I was before I started taking it. 

I clearly don’t get enough fiber in my diet and I’m working on trying to change that. I guess my question is, has anyone tried weaning themselves off or been off Metamucil long enough that they feel normal? If so, how? Did you switch to a vegan diet to do it? I guess being addicted to Metamucil isn’t the worst thing that could happen to you, but I’m just curious if I’m going to have to either take it forever or resign myself to feeling bloated and crappy forever.

We live in different countries, but she will message me and call sometimes, to see how I am, and let me know of occasional family health updates. I actually live in our home country, near the rest of our family, my parents moved to another country to serve gawd. Anyway, they both arrived here yesterday and my mum wanted to meet up today. It was fairly early in the day, so I (like a normal person) suggested we meet at a cafe. I got there 10min early, and when she arrived, I hugged her and asked what she wanted to eat/drink. She was like ""Oh, I don't know. We could just get something from Greggs (a takeaway coffee shop) and eat it on-the-go."" I thought that's a bit weird, but okay. So she went and got us a pastry each and we ate it standing on the street. Then we went shopping. Fine. We had a nice time, and it was good to see her. 
It wasn't until I was on my way home that I realised!!!
There's that scripture about ""not sharing meals with disfellowshipped people"" or whatever it says! But it's okay if you both eat at the same time while standing up on the street?! I had completely forgotten about that ever being a thing, but now that it happened in person, with my own mother, I can't help but feel so sad for her, and also so grateful to no longer be under the thumb of such ridiculous rules.

1kht6be,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1kht6be/seroquel_induced_panic_attacks/,Seroquel induced panic attacks?,"Hi, I'm currently sitting in a hospital's waiting room and have been wondering about this. So I've never had hard-core panic attacks before, might have hyperventilated at most some times but never this. For context, I'm an international student and I wasn't sure where to go to treat my adhd so I went to the emergency of one hospital who told me to go to one that was close to where I lived but still prescribed me quetiapine (seroquel). They told to take up to three pills depending on whether I needed it or not because they knew I was anxious. I kept taking it and then I didn't take it for a day or two if not slightly more. I had my first big panic attack when I thought I was dying and didn't realise what was going on so I called 911 and ended up at the hospital where they told me it was anxiety and not another health hazard. They told me to take my medicine and gave me medicine for my stomach which was hurting and some iron. That was the 11th of April, I kept having symptoms after a few days of things being somewhat okay and I constantly just try to calm myself down, I noticed that taking seroquel makes me sleepy but somehow seems to aggravate my heart palpitations and my sense of distress. I decided to not take it one night and didn't have heart palpitations the next day, so I decided to try and gradually stop it. I then took half a pill and all seemed sort of fine until yesterday night when I started to have symptoms so I took half a pill, then wanting to sleep I took a whole pill then another. (They told me to take up to three and my count then was 2.5) I told myself I'd go to the hospital tomorrow morning and all I needed to do know was sleep. That was hard. Seroquel did make me sleepy but I was panicking the whole time and my heart went crazy, if I wasn't that sleepy it would have been disastrous. I had the worst night of my life waking up again and again with a pounding heart and a huge sense of distress. I'm not waiting at the hospital and had to precise that I needed help now when people mentioned getting an appointment soon at a clinic or another. I cannot keep raking Seroquel as I know highly doubt it's at least in part responsible but I still need something to help my panic attacks. If I have to gradually stop it I also need the proper method since me doing it myself has been unsuccessful. I haven't smoked weed in a long time, I don't smoke cigarettes since my first panic attack except for one time, I did drink a few times afterwards but then I realised I should probably stop taking anything. No alcohol no coffee no cigarettes. Might be important to note that I didn't stop drinking (on weekends and occasions) after seroquel was first prescribed. Maybe that was a factor. I don't know what to do I'm waiting for my turn but I do need help today and I really hope that this is treatable. I live in Canada if that also helps.",1,1746718692.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

This compact washing machine combo made its way into my small apartment, and I have to admit, I underestimated how practical a twin tub washer could be. Balancing a mix of modern features with a semi-automatic design, it manages to provide a simple yet reliable solution for tackling small to medium loads of laundry.

**Compact Design and Portability**

Living in a cozy apartment with limited laundry infrastructure, I found the compact and portable nature of this washer to be incredibly practical. Weighing only 27.5 pounds and measuring 14 x 22.4 x 25.4 inches, I could easily shift it between rooms and store it away when it wasn’t in use. The top-load access and simple controls instantly felt user-friendly. It even fit neatly in my camper during a recent road trip. This versatility impressed me right off the bat.  

[Check INTERGREAT Portable Washer and Dryer B0BV2Q3F8L deals on Amazon now.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0bb72rjjj/)

**Performance and Washing Capacity**

Despite its seemingly small size, I was pleasantly surprised by how much laundry it could handle. The washer tub fits 11 pounds, while the spin dryer accommodates 6.6 pounds. I used it to wash quilts, a couple of jeans, and even my toddler’s messiest outfits, and everything came out spotless. Its two washing cycle options, Gentle and Normal, covered most of what I needed. The 280-watt motor didn’t disappoint either—it provided enough power for the washing and spinning functions to really tackle dirt and stains, making it feel like I wasn’t compromising on cleanliness despite its smaller form factor.

**Good Aspects**

- Dual tub design allows simultaneous washing and drying.  
- Powerful motor ensures effective cleaning and decent spin cycles.  
- Energy-efficient operation for reduced utility costs.  

**Control Simplicity and Features**

I’ve used washing machines that practically required an instruction manual for every wash, but this one felt refreshingly straightforward. The glass cover was a nice touch, letting me peek in during the process. Just a few buttons and dials ensured easy control over the washing and spin times. It genuinely made my laundry routine a ‘set it and forget it’ task. The time control function allowed me to structure my day better—laundry running on one side while I worked or relaxed with a cup of coffee.

**Materials and Durability**

The stainless steel spin tub immediately stood out compared to some competitors that use cheap plastic. It feels durable and long-lasting, and it certainly survived a few accidental bumps when lugging it to my RV. Having a clear glass top cover, instead of more traditional plastic ones, gave it a sturdier and more premium appearance. However, its lightweight build means it still needs some care in handling to avoid potential damage.

**Drawbacks**

- The spin cycle, while powerful, only dries clothes up to about 90%. I often had to air-dry items afterward.  
- Gravity drain might be inconvenient for users without proper drainage setups.  
- Slightly noisy during spinning—something to consider if you’re sensitive to sound.  

**Alternative Products**

Looking at alternatives, products like the COSTWAY Mini Washing Machine and Giantex Portable Washer offer similar features within this price range. While these have comparable capacities, the COSTWAY has a quieter operation, which might be appealing to families with babies. The Giantex, on the other hand, provides a built-in pump, which makes draining a bit easier compared to this gravity-drain system. However, both fell slightly short when it came to the overall washing power and sturdier stainless-steel construction offered here.

**Quality for Price**

From a cost-to-benefit perspective, this washer really feels like a bang for your buck. While not loaded with super-advanced features, its practicality and performance certainly align with its pricing. Being able to skip weekly trips to the laundromat already justifies its value, and I’ve noticed a considerable drop in the expenses I usually rack up at public laundry facilities. It’s an excellent choice for students, RV owners, or anyone in need of a portable yet functional washing machine.

1kht5e2,https://i.redd.it/jlztbz0avkze1.jpeg,New Bee Fanatic,"Hello all! I posted on this forum about a month ago requesting bee ID. You all successfully identified that I have miner bees around my house! 

First of all, we've lived in this house for about 9 years, I think last year, the day of the eclipse,  one of these little bees landed on me. It was clear it wasn't in good condition. Wasn't able to fly well. Looked disoriented. Not sure how else to describe it. Anyways, I tried the sugar water mix, and ultimately the little bee didn't make it. When I tell you I cried like a baby back bitch, I'm not kidding. I was so upset. It felt like such a huge failure. 

This year, though, the ones I found in the window were able to be released. Only one needed the sugar water treatment, which is what I posted before, and it worked marvelously! 

The strange thing is, I spend a lot of time out back with my dogs. These little miner bees also spend a lot of time in the back yard. A lot of times while I'm sitting out back they'll fly right up to me, buzz around a little bit, and then fly off. I still haven't found their burrows, but to be fair there's still a lot of leaf debris (I take that shit a little too seriously I think, but I want the pollinators here to have the best chance before I clean everything up). I've never in my life (with the exception of last year) seen these bees before. It almost feels like they're intentionally dropping by to say hi. It's the coolest thing. I just know when I stop seeing them I'm going to be so sad, lol. They're SO cute! I just adore them. Next year, I'm going to get some flowers started indoors so I can put them out in early spring. Aside from dandelions, daffodils, tulips, and wild violet it's slim pickings for the pollinators right now. 

Sorry for the long post. Just wanted to say thank you for the ID. I've spent a good 30 years of my life being absolutely terrified of bees. But now...now I'm a little obsessed. They are literally the fuzziest, cutest little creatures. I've done a lot of research into miner bees, and they're pretty fascinating little creatures. I wish they lived a lot longer, because the joy it brings me to see them buzzing around the back yard is just insane. They have my heart, lol. I may also do some bulbs at the side and back of the property for them in early spring. Everything else is in the front, so. 

Thanks a bunch bee people! The bee pictured is a miner bee that made it into the house. I spooked it and found it hiding under the coffee pot. Offered it an envelope, which it quickly climbed onto. Put the envelope in the window sill, with the bee outside the screen. It then proceeded to groom itself for about 5 minutes before flying off. Presentation is important. 🤣",2,1746718629.0,bees,1,1.0,False

# The 3 Best Mushrooms for Anxiety

[Mushrooms](https://magicmushroomgrowkits.ca/) have long been appreciated for their culinary value, but in recent years, medicinal mushrooms have exploded in popularity in the health and wellness world. 

[Medicinal mushroom](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/)s are a unique type of fungi that are more [powerful ](https://4090graphicscard.com/)than the standard white button mushrooms you see at a salad bar or topping a veggie pizza, but not quite as potent as those *other* types of mushrooms (no hallucinating here).    

Most commonly [consumed](https://midwesttecsolutions.com/) in their extracted form in a powder or capsule, [medicinal mushrooms](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/) are becoming an increasingly popular way to support health, including reducing anxiety or stress.

Although there are many types of medicinal mushrooms—sometimes referred to as functional mushrooms—the three that are most associated with reduced anxiety are reishi, lion’s mane, and cordyceps. 

# What Are Medicinal Mushrooms?

Medicinal mushrooms provide additional therapeutic benefits above and beyond their nutritional qualities and have been used in Eastern healing practices for millennia. 

**Some functional mushrooms also function as adaptogens, meaning they help the body adapt to stressors.** 

Medicinal mushrooms support immune and digestive health due to a compound called **beta-glucan**, a polysaccharide carbohydrate in the shrooms’ cell walls. 

Beta-glucan is a soluble fiber and prebiotic, providing food for healthy gut bacteria to flourish. 

Another family of compounds that provides medicinal mushrooms with their benefits is the terpenoids, which have been [shown](https://midwesttecsolutions.com/) to protect against neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. 

In addition, medicinal mushrooms have been [found](https://mywayusa.shop/) to:

* Reduce inflammation
* Act as antioxidants
* Provide antimicrobial and antibacterial activity 
* Increase natural energy 
* Support cognitive, immune, metabolic, and cardiovascular health

# What Are Mushroom Supplements?

Mushroom supplements typically are made up of extracted and then dried functional mushrooms. 

They can be consumed in capsule, tincture, or powdered form. 

**The most potent mushroom supplements will use a double extraction process, which utilizes both water and alcohol-based extractions to pull out the full benefits of the mushrooms into the supplement.**

As [medicinal mushroom](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/) powders tend to be bitter, they can be mixed with other ingredients to create a tasty tea or coffee or simply packaged into capsules to avoid the bitter taste. 

# Best Mushrooms For Anxiety

With their high content of beta-glucan fiber and terpenoid compounds, medicinal mushrooms are thought to provide cognitive and mental health benefits.

Many people wonder how many mushrooms they need to take for anxiety. 

The mushroom dose will vary by person and mushroom—as mushroom pills for anxiety tend to come in supplemental form, stick to the recommended dosage you see on the bottle.

# Reishi For Anxiety

Reishi (*Ganoderma lucidum*) is sometimes referred to as the “[mushroom of immortality](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/product/green-supreme-live-sauce/),” as it exhibits potent anti-inflammatory, stress-relieving, and immune-supporting properties. 

In addition to containing beta-glucan polysaccharides, reishi is the only known dietary source of ganoderic acid, a triterpene compound with strong inflammation-fighting potential. 

Reishi also contains 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP), a direct [precursor](https://northwestonlinestore.com/) to serotonin—a neurotransmitter that is sometimes dysregulated in people with mood disorders.

Reishi’s adaptogenic qualities also provide its ability to improve sleep quality, reduce stress, and improve mood.

In a [clinical trial](https://4090graphicscard.com/) of women with fibromyalgia, those who took reishi mushrooms daily for six weeks had trends of **improved happiness and life satisfaction with reductions in depression** compared to baseline levels. 

Another [study](https://mywayusa.shop/) with reishi found that cancer patients taking the mushroom had significantly better markers of subjective well-being with reduced anxiety, stress, and fatigue.  

# Lion’s Mane For Anxiety 

With its name originating from the mushroom’s likeness to the long hair of a lion, the lion’s mane mushroom (*Hericium erinaceus*) is known to benefit the brain and central nervous system. 

**Lion’s mane contains bioactive compounds called erinacines that support nerve growth factors like BDNF** (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which increases neurogenesis—the growth of new neurons in the adult brain. 

Low BDNF levels are [linked](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/product/budder-northern-lights/) to depression and anxiety, so this is one possible way that lion’s mane supports mood regulation. 

Lion’s mane also reduces the activity of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules called cytokines and scavenges for free radicals that cause oxidative damage to cells. 

This neuroprotective role lends itself to reducing anxiety, as lion’s mane aids in coping with stress and prevents a decrease in serotonin and dopamine.

In [rese](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Buy-Budder-%E2%80%93-Northern-Lights-Online.jpg)[arch](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29091526/) with stressed mice, supplementation with lion’s mane exerted anxiety-reducing and antidepressant-like effects, which were mediated by enhancing neurogenesis in the brain’s hippocampus. 

# Cordyceps For Anxiety

Cordyceps is a parasitic fungi genus containing over 700 species, although *Cordyceps sinensis* and *Cordyceps militaris* are the two most commonly studied. 

Traditionally, the cordyceps [mushroom](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/) has been used to stimulate energy, stamina, and endurance—which you might think would be unhelpful for anxiety. 

**However, cordyceps’ anti-inflammatory and adaptogenic qualities have associated this mushroom with reduced anxiety and depression.** 

Research suggests that cordyceps exhibit anti-depressive activity by acting on certain receptor sites in the central nervous system, which are [thought to play a role](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/) in modulating neurotransmitter activity and mood.

Although many studies have reported the anti-stress abilities of cordyceps in animals, we don’t have research with humans yet.

However, a triple-blind randomized controlled [clinical trial](https://magicmushroomgrowkits.ca/) is currently underway in Taiwan, looking at the impact of cordyceps supplementation on mood and cortisol levels in adults.",1,1746718593.0,MicrodosingMushroom,0,1.0,False

Or is it my ocd making me overanalyze?,"Two summers ago, I was in Brazil with my boyfriend when my childhood best friend tragically passed away. I was heartbroken and felt deep guilt for not speaking to him in the months before his death—because my boyfriend didn’t want me talking to other men, even old friends. I left Brazil early to attend the funeral, and while I needed emotional support, my boyfriend was upset I left and didn’t seem to grasp how devastating the loss was. I felt completely alone.

While he remained in Brazil, we had a series of emotional arguments. During one fight, I threatened to break up like we had done in the past, ( as we were young and a little immature at the time) not meaning it. But this time, he agreed. He started expressing doubt about our future and said he wanted to raise his kids in Brazil one day. I was crushed. I had believed we were close to getting engaged. Instead, I spiraled into my lowest point—barely eating, not sleeping, and consumed by anxiety and fear of losing him. Though we stayed together, my sense of emotional safety was badly shaken.

Back at college for my senior year, things were still tense between us, and I felt extremely alone on campus. My best friend had moved off campus, my sister (my roommate) was always with her boyfriend, and most of my other friends had graduated. I prayed to find new friends but struggled. I’ve always found it easier to befriend men, especially since they tend to show interest if they find you attractive. One day, a guy on campus introduced himself, and later we connected on Instagram. He responded to one of my stories, and our conversation led to hanging out.

When we met up to study, and he asked me about my summer. I ended up getting emotional and crying as I opened up about how painful my summer was—losing my best friend, and all the issues I had with my boyfriend. I apologized, and he was kind, telling me he was glad to be there to listen. I think part of me hoped he’d want to be my friend, even if it was because he liked me, because I was desperate for companionship.

Later, we went out for coffee, and he brought up my boyfriend again— I think because we had left our last conversation off with me crying about him and my late best friend. I ended up telling him about my relationship concerns. I admitted I was frustrated about not being engaged yet, and told him about the emotional distance and uncertainty I’d been feeling. I told him about some of my fears with my relationship etc. At the same time, I made sure to say, “I love him and can’t let him go,” because that was always true. I never doubted that I wanted to stay with my boyfriend. Still, I think I might have subconsciously made my issues sound more dramatic, maybe to keep this guy’s interest as a friend or listener. But I never saw him as anything more. I have always done this even with my female friends. I used to like to stir the pot for a response (I know, toxic lowkey I’m not proud). I think this is where I fear if it was cheating or not. Because I wonder if me wanting him to have interest in me so he would want to be my friend is considered unfaithful. I never flirted with him or anything but if in my mind I was hoping he would have a little crush so he would want to be my friend more? Is that bad if I don’t directly say anything or flirt? Or is that just an intrusive thought?

I tried to set him up with my friends—both to make my intentions clear and maybe distract him if he did like me. But I also worried that if he started dating someone, I’d be alone again. It wasn’t jealousy, just fear of isolation. He paid for my coffee, wiped spilled coffee off my hand, and offered me his jacket—but I made sure not to wear it, as that felt like something too intimate. This is why I felt like I was maintaining boundaries at the time- no flirting, no romantic banter or anything etc. 

Eventually, I told my boyfriend everything. I had looked up whether having a guy friend was wrong, and most said keeping it a secret was. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I loved him. As soon as I told him, I cut off contact with the guy because he told me to and obviously I did because I didn’t want to hurt my boyfriend. ; I just needed someone’s attention to not feel alone.

Since then, I’ve been tormented by guilt. I’ve wondered daily if what I did was cheating—even though I never flirted, never wanted him, and never imagined being with him. I thought I was keeping things respectful by maintaining boundaries in my mind. But now, I constantly fear that I crossed a line I didn’t mean to.

This happened almost two years ago. I have not been able to let it go with fear that I cheated. I take cheating very seriously and also have really bad moral OCD that has been diagnosed so I don’t know if it is that or if my fears are true. Thanks so much!!!

Edited: this male friend never expressed romantic interest in me. Neither did I to him. Neither of us flirted with eachother or expressed romantic interest at all. It was just a thought in my head of like “he might like me and that’s why he’s giving me attention and I’m okay with that bc I won’t ever let anything happen”. ",0,1746718555.0,perth,12,0.23,False

I (32M) started dating someone new about a week ago. Things seemed promising at first, but there have been a few behaviors that are really bothering me — and I’m starting to wonder if I overreacted or if my frustration is valid.

Every time we’ve met up, he’s been late by 30 to 45 minutes. Every single time. The place we usually meet is a café that's literally super close to where he lives  no traffic or long drive excuses.

Another weird pattern: while we’re out shopping or walking around, he randomly says “hang on a sec” and then disappears for 10–15 minutes without explanation. It’s happened three separate times. No heads-up, no follow-up, just vanishes and comes back like nothing happened.

The final straw was yesterday. He messaged me saying “let’s meet now at the coffee shop.” I went there right away. I waited for an hour. I called him twice and texted to say I’d head out if he wasn’t coming. I even ordered an Uber. Right before I left, he showed up.

At that point, I was honestly pissed. I told him straight up that I was about to leave because he was the one who asked to meet right then — not me. He said he was at work, but to me, it just didn’t make sense to ask someone to come immediately if you're not actually ready to show up yourself.

He seemed a bit cornered and apologized. We still went ahead with the meetup, but the whole vibe was off  cold, weird, awkward. Honestly, I felt kind of stupid for waiting so long.

I’m someone who deeply respects people’s time. If I say I’ll be somewhere, I show up on time — or early. This whole thing made me feel disregarded and like my time just didn’t matter.

So Reddit, AITA for getting mad and calling him out over this? Or am I making too much of a big deal this early on?

I sectioned parts, hopefully that helps?

TLDR; First part: childhood stuff / trying to be independent?

Second part: the recent argument, where she blocked me, regarding mothers day and me, maybe ""snapping"".

-------

I'm not sure entirely what to do about this situation. 

Me and my mom have a weird relationship, I feel like it's gotten worse as I've gotten older, moved out, and now am getting married in a year.

This is doubled with me reflecting on my childhood and trying to be honest to myself and my family, that unfortunately, things were pretty bad.

My mom was never violent, and it wasn't all bad- but for a large majority, she struggled a lot with her mental health. I begged her at times to seek help.

She would have intense outbursts if you spoke out against her, she's the mother after all and knows best / all. She would basically ""freak-out"" if anybody upset her, like a massive inability to handle her emotions- we were not allowed to have any other opinions than hers.

She's also always right, and always the victim, and seldom should she apologize. 

She would scream, curse, slam doors and cabinets, lock herself in rooms and be sobbing, threaten my dad consistently with divorce, etc. It was awful. 

Fights between her and just one person in the family, would turn into an hours long event that everyone had to be involved in, and of course at the end, we'd have to console her and tell her she's a good person, not that she isnt- but it's that vibe.

It didn't feel like parenting, she'd be upset, and beg me / my siblings to be on her side in any scenario, which in turn, would put us siblings against each other, we'd fight in some circumstances as well at each other, just due to the environment. It felt like it pushed us apart as siblings.

This, on top of the emotional incest- she wanted us kids to be her best friends, but we couldn't be, what 30 year old wants a child or pre-teen as a friend? You can't go to a kid for emotional support, or to vent your problems and yet she did. 

And for the mental health, she was extremely anxious and paranoid all the time, which has led to me having an intense anxiety disorder, and agoraphobia- something I've had to work to fix myself. No help.

She constantly spoke her fears out loud into my ear, I'll get kidnapped, r*ped, assaulted, etc. We couldn't have sleepovers as a kid, because she feared their fathers would touch us. Kids could only come to our house.

When I met my now fiance, he helped me realize what was / wasn't healthy, and push for better boundaries, this was good for me, but ultimately made things worse.

---------

To recap my push for independence:

I got a job, this was exciting for my parents, until they were broke and needed money from me all the time. 

Helping at the house is fine, but I could never save on my own, they took so much, and never paid back. 

I gave my dad my entire first paycheck, that I ever earned. 

I was meant to help pay groceries consistently, their excuse was I live in the house and use the utilities and food.

To an extent, reasonable, but me wanting to move out? I could never save enough, and was just stuck working for nothing. 

Met my fiance and started dating? First time my mom spoke to him, in our house, she joked about us having sex in my bedroom (I was a very conservative virgin) (also him too) and laughed, begging us to have kids.

Don't know how this guy stayed, but he's amazing. 

My mom also has a want to be friend with all my friends, I can't explain this vibe- but it's uncomfortable. She adds all my friends on social media, and comments on their posts as if they're buddies, but none of my friends reciprocate this feeling.

She tried to add a coworker on Facebook and he asked me face to face to tell my mom to stop, because she kept requesting...she took this as him being a rude, mean person. 

Me and my mom went for coffee, and she took a picture of me without my permission, and sent it to my fiance, before we were officially dating. She thought it was funny, texting him- again, like buddies, and having this ""dumb"" photo of me.

At this time I was practicing what I wanted, so I told her calmly to please not do this, it makes me upset. 

She berated me for being embarrassed, saying things like ""why would you like thus guy if you're so easily embarrassed like this, you're not being honest with him."" And then proceeded to scream and yell in the middle of the mall at me. Saying I was overreacting for setting a boundary. She threatened to leave me behind in the mall, and practically ran away from me, again, sobbing.

Eventually she did start therapy, but somehow, didn't grasp anything.

She used therapy against me, she would tell me ""my therapist said you're wrong."" And use buzz-words like boundaries and communication, stuff I started bringing up, and completely missing the point in any of it. It just felt weird and wrong.

When me and my fiance were finally moving out, she begged me to move into the house next door. She brought it up a million times, and each time I said no, because I needed space. 

Me and my fiance were struggling to find a place and again, I got berated because I ""wasn't listening to them"" (my parents) on how to get an apartment. They knew best, and it was my fault we couldn't find somewhere. 

And again, my mom would bring up this house next door. Saying things like ""you guys have no choice, you aren't finding any places."" At some point I snapped and said no, I don't want to live in this town, next door to them. She sobbed, as usual- and got so upset. My dad made me apologize. 

To sum up, me and my mom have fought a lot, and I'm writing a lot here. Maybe too much.

--------

Our recent argument feels the most, ugh.

I feel guilty, and sad, and iced out. I don't know what to do, or how to move forward. 

I don't want to cut her out, my fiance begs me to, but it's my mother.

What happened recently:

Mothers day is approaching. 

I always hated mothers day, I thought previously because it was just a ""dumb holiday"" but it's clicked that maybe, it's because of my relationship with my mom.

Nonetheless, I was planning on celebrating with her, me and my fiance agreed.

The thing is, my mom brought up mothers day so many times, like an absurd amount. I said yes so many times, it was so frustrating. 

Mothers day also, has never felt like a choice, it feels like an obligation, a want for her to have praise and adoration. 

anytime we saw each other, she would bring up Mothers day.

Unfortunately me and my fiance are low on finances, saving up for our wedding so we couldn't do anything expensive. 

My parents are also consistently broke (they're big spenders) so they couldn't either.

I brought this up, and she agreed and she offered (again, she offered first) that we meet up on the 18th with my grandmother as well.

Great idea, works for everyone and is after we get our paychecks.

I agreed with the plan and then, well.

She sent me a long, big paragraph being ""honest"" (her words) about how it's said she only has 1 child celebrating Mother's day with her (my other sibling is no contact).

This felt so frustrating because I literally agreed, for the actual mother's day and a rescheduled day.

My thoughts are she 1) won't and can't communicate regularly and just ask me to come over on the regular day anyways (I hate their house though).

And 2) wants me to make the amazing, big grand gesture of coming to their house and seeing her anyways, for me to drop everything in my life and do something fancy.

After this paragraph I did say multiple times I can still come on the actual mother's day, but this wasn't really I guess, acceptable.

Eventually I just...snapped. I feel really bad about this, but also, it's the truth, how I feel?

I told her I don't like mothers day, and that it's difficult for me and explained my feelings from childhood, maybe a bit roughly, but just- the consistent asking about the holiday (when I said yes, so many times) and now this? Ugh.

I told her I'm starting therapy soon, and maybe I need space, but that I don't want to cut her out of my life, I even went as far as to say I want us to be closer, and fix our relationship problems. 

She sent me long paragraphs victimizing herself instead, and being so, so mad.

And then, her tone shifted quite intensely and she agreed on me doing therapy, but it didn't feel like understanding. 

She basically said I need help, and that memories can deceive people (aka my childhood thoughts).

Then she claimed she's an abuser, and why would I want to be around an abuser, how can I heal?

Through all this, she also referred to me being mentally 19 years old, I'm 24.

Then, she blocked me everywhere. 

I could still see her post, and a lot of it is her posting sad quotes about how hard being a parent is.

She also made posts referencing me, saying how sad she is and thanking all the people who called her to check in...saying she's basically told everyone she knows this ""drama"" through phone call.

She's done this during our other fights too.

I'm a very private person, but she goes online and blasts what's happening everywhere, I think she wants people to agree with her or something. 

What's also stressing me out, is she puts my whole family against me, I feel so iced out and alone right now.

My dad takes her side no matter what, and my older sibling is like her perfect, golden child twin.

I just feel alone and don't know where to go with this.

What makes this worse is, although I deleted the messages, I did text her apologizing before she blocked me.

I always apologize first, I just feel bad, but she never does it for me.

1khsxjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/mtg/comments/1khsxjq/looking_for_fun_interactive_deck_recommendations/,Looking for fun interactive deck recommendations for a surprise.,"My husband used to play MTG like semi-professionally, we owned a gaming store and traveled often for GPs and the pro tours, etc. We moved to Europe, he got his masters degree, etc. and professional magic got less rewarding for him as the structure changed and we haven't played outside of online since before covid. We don't own decks anymore really, because we sold all our stuff before moving abroad. We have the Jiang Yanggu & Mu Yanling duel decks we play with our daughter, but they are really basic and one is way better than the other IMO. 



**I would love to put together a few decks for us to play casually for fun at coffee shops** again because we both enjoy it a lot and I want to surprise him because he will appreciate the thought and effort. That being said, he built all my decks because tweaking them is part of what he enjoys so I am a little out of my depth and to look up top decks on mtg goldfish or something is a bit overwhelming for me because I don't want to pick decks that don't compliment each other well and there are just so many. 

  
The decks we played most consistently that I can remember are for Modern (I think) I played merfolks and I'm not sure what he played but **he always picks shananiganie combo decks, ideally with like little ways to create things like infinite combos**, and he often pushed for rainbow when drafting if he can get proper mana support. I had a deck maybe like 6-8 years ago that was a blue/red man who is like up in the air with ribbony stuff around him, a hasty boy I believe, and it was a prowess deck that I remember really liking. I started playing in like 2015 during origins maybe? so I don't know a lot of older mechanics but I have no problem learning. Lorwyn is my favorite set vibe wise and I am not huge on artifacts or eldrazi. He loves Pauper and Drafting because of liking the interactions of cards, I enjoy that too but in easy specific ways like trying to bring back something like goblin darkdwellers not in the convoluted ways his decks always do, he is always doing shit with his graveyard or bouncing his own stuff, etc. I want to be doing like a satisfying 500 pieces puzzle and I feel like he wants to be doing like a 5000-piece puzzle. **We often find that heavy control decks aren't that fun for the other person** to play against because you basically just don't let them go. I don't know if that is a ton of random info or helpful, but here we are. 

  
I think building **either a handful of decks (4-5 maybe) in the same format** with cards we haven't gotten to play with yet, that we can swap decks and play different match ups against each other would be nice (the last set I was really aware of was around the time of the fairy tale gingerbread man type cards but we didn't ever play with that set or any after), **or building like 2 standard decks with cards we haven't gotten to play with much and 2 modern or later decks** (I get older sets can be really pricey but that's fine). I am guessing he usually builds me decks to be well-positioned against his, since he is so much better than me. 



**I would appreciate any suggestions on what you would build, based on this info or what decks you enjoy.** He will be happy either way, I used to build decks based on random stuff like ""turtles"" decks with no thought about what they did, just vibes and they were terrible and we had fun and he was always happy to play them but before I put down a ton of money I want to feel confident we will enjoy the way they match up together for a long time and they will **be stimulated enough for us not to get bored with the combos and match ups and interactions.** 

  
**TLDR:** Looking for **fun deck options** for casual home play with an advanced player who likes multi-color combo decks and a casual player who tends to like more aggressive decks with easy combos. Format, legality, and budget don't matter. Maybe 2 decks in standard, 2 in modern or 4-5 in the same format that will all play well against each other and have enough interesting interactions for us to play them over and over again for a while.

I’ll give some background, me (f21) and my (m24) friend have known each-other roughly around 2 years now and have been good friends since. From random meet ups in coffee shops and nice walks we’ve always hit it off. From the day I met him it felt like I’d known him a life time.

Over the first few months of talking things developed and became extremely flirty over text, mostly when we’d both had a drink. This continued for nearly 2 years up until recently when I asked him out for a few drinks, he’d not been too well and I didn’t think he’d agree but surprisingly he did. After spending the entire night talking and laughing we went back to mine and put a film on. One thing lead to another and we ended up sleeping together, it was the best night of my life and honestly I felt so comfortable with him. After that he cuddled up to me and I fell asleep. Sometime in the early hours he got up and left but did text me so when I’d wake up I’d see it haha. Think he knew I’d be a little hungover.

Forwarding on we spontaneously decided to go on a mini break nothing crazy just one night, we sat down had a few drinks and just chatted away, the night was perfect and even when we were silent it was comfortable. He was constantly checking in to see if I was warm and happy, helped me set up my little pitch so I was cosy and honestly it was perfect.

Here’s where I’m lost, on our little night out the other week we got talking about morals and relationships and he said “if we were together, I’d look after you and provide for you it’s my job” then backtracked and said “but erm I’d do the same for anyone I’m with” then ran off to the toilet a moment later haha. Now I feel like that was a slip of tongue and he let it slip that he does like me.

We both aren’t open people when it comes to talks like that but I am growing more and more fond of him as the days go on. I’ve always liked him but that is getting stronger and I don’t know what to say or if I should say something? This man makes me feel safe and secure for the first time in my life I feel valued and I really don’t want to ruin a good friendship if he doesn’t feel the same.

1khsu9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1khsu9a/its_time_for_the_kendu_inu_leg_up/,It's time for the Kendu inu leg up!,"Guys, I just wanted to drop some thoughts on Kendu Inu, because honestly, the more I look into it, the more convinced I am that this is a rare gem in the memecoin space.

First of all: the token distribution is insanely good. I was checking the data, and the top 10 holders (excluding the DEXs like Uniswap and the Solana portal, which obviously hold tokens for liquidity reasons) only control about 11% of the total supply which is basically nothing compared to most other memecoins where the top wallets often control 30–40% or more.

If you zoom out further, the top 100 holders only hold about 40% of the total — again, super rare.  This kind of healthy distribution really sets the stage for when the next leg up comes — it means the price is much more resistant to sudden dumps from a few big whales, which is exactly what wrecked so many other tokens last year.

Another thing that makes Kendu special: the community. It’s honestly the most fun and immersive communities I’ve been part of in crypto. They’re not just posting memes — we’ve got merch, coffee, energy drinks, t-shirts, and honestly, just a lot of cool people who are here for the long haul. It’s a cult, not just another pump-and-dump.

Also, if you look back over the past few months, during this brutal bear period, pretty much everything else collapsed — but Kendu has held solid at around $10M market cap. That’s because the holders have diamond hands. They’re not paper-handing every little dip. This kind of resilience is what gives me confidence that when the real breakout comes, Kendu will be one of the ones that actually takes off and holds its gains.

Anyway, just wanted to share some thoughts. This is honestly the perfect moment to get in — before the bull run hits and before the next leg up. Once things start moving, it’s going to be a lot harder (and more expensive) to stack up. Don’t sleep on it.",20,1746717857.0,CryptoMoonShots,11,0.95,False

1khsrti,https://i.redd.it/45c3q9xhskze1.jpeg,"Found an injured parakeet outside my work, outdoor cats known to roam there regularly and I think he got into a scuffle, need advice","When we found him, he was cautious but didn’t try to get away until we were very close. Then tried to fly, flew maybe a foot in the air, 3-5 feet away, and landed, clearly struggling a bit.

Most obvious injury is his tail feather, which based on what I spent all night reading and my observations seems to fit a dislocated follicle best (but obviously I don’t know).

We weren’t able to get to a vet that was open/available by the time work was out, so I bought a small cage from petco and did my best to choose things that would be helpful. I was trying to research everything in the store but had no service in there whatsoever, ended up buying shit that turns out is bad (fleece hut, a hanging coconut hut with a ladder tethered by rope with many splaying ends, toys that I very quickly lost confidence in when I looked em up.

I wasn’t even sure how to provide a comfortable bed, as I thought the fleece thing would be fine so I didn’t get anything else. And now everywhere was closed. I have a rock collection and a small cardboard mat that’s wrapped in a firm, non-splaying fabric, he seemed to do well with that all evening and has since, so I kept it in there.

Made a small bed of rocks - flat, smooth river and ocean rocks with no dangerous mineral inclusions that were already deeply sterilized and stored away since. Tried to choose ones that retained heat best didn’t have a wide variety of these, but this morning that seemed to be his preferred location.

Just to be safe I put a heavy Starbucks mug made for hot coffee, to maintain heat, if for no other reason than to have a hiding hole. Adjusted the layout of the stuff in the cage repeatedly as I observed and looked up issues, it’s all very subpar but it’s the best I could do.

Now my girlfriend and I are a bit worried, we don’t know parakeets but his breathing just doesn’t seem right to us. The way he opens and closes his eyes also doesn’t seem right. When we got him home and gave him food, he ate more than I think he weighs, not sure how long he was wandering alone outside but seemed starving. Then passed out. 

He’s eating again now, higher energy, maybe just recovery? I mean I know he’s got an injury, going to the vet soon.

Reason I added the details is because I have 2 questions:

1. Any thoughts on the tail feather, the stretching one leg out occasionally (not sure I mentioned that), the breathing or eyes? Does the breathing and slow blinks look normal for parakeets?

2. What the hell do I put in this cage? I’m not surprised petco sucks, but literally everything I could get there ended up being dangerous or seductive. The fucks with that? I am doing some research, but hoping to get specific recommendations, hopefully some links to buy

Also yes I am going to get a bigger cage and we want to get him a friend when he’s recovered a bit more, I just got the smallest one as a recovery cage for the next few days or week",9,1746717694.0,Parakeets,17,1.0,False

I’ve used a couple free VPNs in the past, mainly ProtonVPN and Windscribe but I never paid much attention to reliability until now.

I tried using ProtonVPN during a client Zoom call at a café and it dropped mid-meeting, which was super awkward. After that, I switched to Windscribe’s free plan and it held up better.

When it comes to storefront signage, first impressions can make or break your business—especially in a growing city like **San Marcos, Texas**. Whether you're opening a boutique on The Square or running a restaurant near Texas State University, your sign is a powerful marketing tool. So, which type of sign should you choose?

Let’s explore how [channel letter signs](https://trueimpactsigns.com/channel-letters/) stack up against other common storefront options—and why the right choice might depend on your location, business type, and visibility needs.

# What Are Channel Letter Signs?

Channel letter signs are three-dimensional, individually crafted letters (or logos) often illuminated with LEDs. They’re typically mounted on building facades and are popular for their bold, professional appearance.

**Pros of Channel Letter Signs:**

* **High visibility, day or night**
* **Customizable fonts, colors, and styles**
* **Energy-efficient LED lighting**
* **Durable in San Marcos weather conditions**

These signs are commonly seen on shopping centers, standalone retail locations, and franchise stores.

# Other Common Storefront Sign Options

Here’s how other sign types compare:

# 1. Panel Signs (Flat Signs)

* Made from materials like PVC, metal, or acrylic
* Often printed or painted with the business name/logo

**Pros:** Affordable, quick to install  
**Cons:** Less impactful from a distance, no lighting unless backlit separately

# 2. Blade Signs (Perpendicular Signs)

* Mounted perpendicular to the building, sticking out for visibility from sidewalks

**Pros:** Great for pedestrian-heavy areas like Downtown San Marcos  
**Cons:** Limited space for branding, not as noticeable by passing cars

# 3. Neon Signs

* Eye-catching and nostalgic; often used for bars or vintage-style shops

**Pros:** Unique aesthetic  
**Cons:** High maintenance, not energy-efficient

# 4. Digital LED Displays

* Programmable screens for text, animation, or video

**Pros:** Great for restaurants, event venues, or churches  
**Cons:** Expensive and may require local permits due to brightness regulations

# What Works Best in San Marcos?

San Marcos combines **a vibrant college-town vibe** with **historic charm and modern development**. Here's how to make the right signage choice:

# ✅ Channel Letter Signs Work Best If:

* You're located along major roads like I-35 or Aquarena Springs Dr.
* You need high visibility and night-time recognition
* You want to create a modern, upscale appearance

**Popular among:** Chain retailers, gyms, banks, medical clinics

# ✅ Blade or Neon Signs Work Best If:

* You’re in walkable areas like The Square or Downtown
* You want a retro or artsy look to match the neighborhood vibe

**Popular among:** Coffee shops, bars, tattoo parlors, indie boutiques

# Final Thoughts

In a city like San Marcos, the **right storefront sign is not just about aesthetics—it's a strategic decision**. Channel letter signs offer unmatched visibility and branding impact, especially for businesses looking to stand out along busy roadways. However, other options may work better for small businesses in foot-traffic areas with character and charm.

1khsl6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMars/comments/1khsl6g/kendu_sendu_mfers/,KENDU SENDU MFERS,"Welcome to DeFi where a coin can only truly be dead when the community has abandoned it. If you search hard enough, you will find FUD on coins like Shib and Pepe back when they were at very low marketcaps like 50m or some shit. Even more recently with SPX they were dead for over a year before overnight picking up and running it up to nearly a billion.   
  
I've actually found a Pepe fudder from way before it really took off, and if this account shown in the links below held a decent bag from this tweet, they would currently be in possession of generational wealth.

[https:\/\/x.com\/AltcoinDailyio\/status\/1654893606292062209](https://preview.redd.it/g9d4g31gqkze1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9844420007ad4e5941dc9d8f5721a1f4e7074abd)

  
What this means is you never want to pay attention to anything people are saying about something (yes I know this is kind of contradictory to this whole post but stay with me here). Even if someone says that Kendu is cooked or whatever, just do your own research and come to your own conclusions.

With a community as hard working as Kendu you cannot rule us out. Stay with me now. We have been on a downtrend for a while now (which we've just broken out of today, see: [legendary comeback on the charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1khjdkl/kendu_just_brokeout_nothing_is_stopping_this_now/)) but the Chad's in the tg are nonstop grinding every day and night to ensure that we make it. You can't listen to the FUD, it's simply going to cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars - if not millions. Right now is clearly a generational entry into Kendu, it is so clearly undervalued that it is genuinely laughable. The reversal is so imminent you have to be stupid to think otherwise. Sure, the coin might fall to a little lower from this point, but it also might've found its bottom and shoot straight back up to 50-100 milly, which is probably what is going to happen from here seeing the massive reversal in the wider market today. 

Either way, now is the time to get involved. Drown out the FUD that you hear. Imagine if early Shib holders listened to the FUD when their coin went down 95% (they all would later be millionaires from holding, I know a few personally who were in Shib in the early days and heard a lot of stories from people who have lost their minds... They are not pretty). Imagine if the early Pepe holders listened to the image attached to this post. They would have also lost out on their generational entry and wealth. Keep your head in the game and give yourself a reality check. Money will NEVER come easy and listening to the FUD is why 99% of DeFi investors (degens) have a negative PnL with no hopes of turning it green.

Look at the past Shiba Inu profit chart from release to ATH's:

[shib chart before and after mooning](https://preview.redd.it/12k7hzlzqkze1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fa248b01d196f9b356a4349ec2256119805d0b2)

And what is KENDU you may ask? Well let me explain...

  
The project has changed the lives of many thousands of community members.

A Kendu (can-do) attitude has made countless people get up off the couch, out of retirement, and out on the streets building under the brand umbrella.

The Kendu community has built:

\- A Kendu Games Studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs  
\- Kendu beers  
\- A Kendu board game  
\- Kendu energy drinks  
\- Kendu events company in India  
\- Kendu events presence USA  
\- Kendu sports brand (You Kendu It)  
\- Kendu eSports team  
\- Kendu coffee brand  
\- Kendu sweets, chocolates, and spirits  
\- Much more in the works

Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.

Imagine a permissionless brand behemoth that anyone can build under, immediately tapping into a scaling CaaS (Community-as-a-service), where the treasury is voluntarily, not contractually, is replenished by those building businesses under Kendu, and that treasury is transparently used for grants for products, businesses, or initiatives the community wants to build with Kendu. Almost akin to an L1.

And of course kendu is still a memecoin so everything relates back to the Kendu dog on the coin for those wondering. I believe Kendu will become the industry standard, forcing future coins to start innovating rather than trying the same structure of the typical coin we see today: create some bland narrative, start getting KOLs to call it (mad apes, pow etc... people who only want supply) and then proceed to run the coin for a week before leaving it.

You can Kendufy anything. And everything will be Kendufied.

1khsi1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicMushroomUSA/comments/1khsi1f/the_3_best_mushrooms_for_anxiety/,The 3 Best Mushrooms for Anxiety,"# The 3 Best Mushrooms for Anxiety

[Mushrooms](https://magicmushroomgrowkits.ca/) have long been appreciated for their culinary value, but in recent years, medicinal mushrooms have exploded in popularity in the health and wellness world. 

[Medicinal mushroom](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/)s are a unique type of fungi that are more [powerful ](https://4090graphicscard.com/)than the standard white button mushrooms you see at a salad bar or topping a veggie pizza, but not quite as potent as those *other* types of mushrooms (no hallucinating here).    

Most commonly [consumed](https://midwesttecsolutions.com/) in their extracted form in a powder or capsule, [medicinal mushrooms](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/) are becoming an increasingly popular way to support health, including reducing anxiety or stress.

Although there are many types of medicinal mushrooms—sometimes referred to as functional mushrooms—the three that are most associated with reduced anxiety are reishi, lion’s mane, and cordyceps. 

# What Are Medicinal Mushrooms?

Medicinal mushrooms provide additional therapeutic benefits above and beyond their nutritional qualities and have been used in Eastern healing practices for millennia. 

**Some functional mushrooms also function as adaptogens, meaning they help the body adapt to stressors.** 

Medicinal mushrooms support immune and digestive health due to a compound called **beta-glucan**, a polysaccharide carbohydrate in the shrooms’ cell walls. 

Beta-glucan is a soluble fiber and prebiotic, providing food for healthy gut bacteria to flourish. 

Another family of compounds that provides medicinal mushrooms with their benefits is the terpenoids, which have been [shown](https://midwesttecsolutions.com/) to protect against neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. 

In addition, medicinal mushrooms have been [found](https://mywayusa.shop/) to:

* Reduce inflammation
* Act as antioxidants
* Provide antimicrobial and antibacterial activity 
* Increase natural energy 
* Support cognitive, immune, metabolic, and cardiovascular health

# What Are Mushroom Supplements?

Mushroom supplements typically are made up of extracted and then dried functional mushrooms. 

They can be consumed in capsule, tincture, or powdered form. 

**The most potent mushroom supplements will use a double extraction process, which utilizes both water and alcohol-based extractions to pull out the full benefits of the mushrooms into the supplement.**

As [medicinal mushroom](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/) powders tend to be bitter, they can be mixed with other ingredients to create a tasty tea or coffee or simply packaged into capsules to avoid the bitter taste. 

# Best Mushrooms For Anxiety

With their high content of beta-glucan fiber and terpenoid compounds, medicinal mushrooms are thought to provide cognitive and mental health benefits.

Many people wonder how many mushrooms they need to take for anxiety. 

The mushroom dose will vary by person and mushroom—as mushroom pills for anxiety tend to come in supplemental form, stick to the recommended dosage you see on the bottle.

# Reishi For Anxiety

Reishi (*Ganoderma lucidum*) is sometimes referred to as the “[mushroom of immortality](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/product/green-supreme-live-sauce/),” as it exhibits potent anti-inflammatory, stress-relieving, and immune-supporting properties. 

In addition to containing beta-glucan polysaccharides, reishi is the only known dietary source of ganoderic acid, a triterpene compound with strong inflammation-fighting potential. 

Reishi also contains 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP), a direct [precursor](https://northwestonlinestore.com/) to serotonin—a neurotransmitter that is sometimes dysregulated in people with mood disorders.

Reishi’s adaptogenic qualities also provide its ability to improve sleep quality, reduce stress, and improve mood.

In a [clinical trial](https://4090graphicscard.com/) of women with fibromyalgia, those who took reishi mushrooms daily for six weeks had trends of **improved happiness and life satisfaction with reductions in depression** compared to baseline levels. 

Another [study](https://mywayusa.shop/) with reishi found that cancer patients taking the mushroom had significantly better markers of subjective well-being with reduced anxiety, stress, and fatigue.  

# Lion’s Mane For Anxiety 

With its name originating from the mushroom’s likeness to the long hair of a lion, the lion’s mane mushroom (*Hericium erinaceus*) is known to benefit the brain and central nervous system. 

**Lion’s mane contains bioactive compounds called erinacines that support nerve growth factors like BDNF** (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which increases neurogenesis—the growth of new neurons in the adult brain. 

Low BDNF levels are [linked](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/product/budder-northern-lights/) to depression and anxiety, so this is one possible way that lion’s mane supports mood regulation. 

Lion’s mane also reduces the activity of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules called cytokines and scavenges for free radicals that cause oxidative damage to cells. 

This neuroprotective role lends itself to reducing anxiety, as lion’s mane aids in coping with stress and prevents a decrease in serotonin and dopamine.

In [rese](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Buy-Budder-%E2%80%93-Northern-Lights-Online.jpg)[arch](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29091526/) with stressed mice, supplementation with lion’s mane exerted anxiety-reducing and antidepressant-like effects, which were mediated by enhancing neurogenesis in the brain’s hippocampus. 

# Cordyceps For Anxiety

Cordyceps is a parasitic fungi genus containing over 700 species, although *Cordyceps sinensis* and *Cordyceps militaris* are the two most commonly studied. 

Traditionally, the cordyceps [mushroom](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/) has been used to stimulate energy, stamina, and endurance—which you might think would be unhelpful for anxiety. 

**However, cordyceps’ anti-inflammatory and adaptogenic qualities have associated this mushroom with reduced anxiety and depression.** 

Research suggests that cordyceps exhibit anti-depressive activity by acting on certain receptor sites in the central nervous system, which are [thought to play a role](https://magicmushroomsporesusa.com/) in modulating neurotransmitter activity and mood.

Although many studies have reported the anti-stress abilities of cordyceps in animals, we don’t have research with humans yet.

However, a triple-blind randomized controlled [clinical trial](https://magicmushroomgrowkits.ca/) is currently underway in Taiwan, looking at the impact of cordyceps supplementation on mood and cortisol levels in adults.",1,1746717033.0,MagicMushroomUSA,0,1.0,False

I’m 6’2” and around 187 pounds, so ingredients like magnesium are dosed in a way that suits my size and needs. If you’re smaller, larger, a different gender, or have different nutritional needs, you may want to adjust some ingredients.

Also, the drink contains spicy ingredients like cayenne, ginger, and turmeric. If you’re sensitive to heat or have digestive issues, that might be too intense. It can also affect digestion — in my case, in a really good way — but start small if you’re unsure.

I lost about 50 pounds over the past couple of years, but I was stuck around 195 for months—no matter what I did, the scale wouldn’t budge. Since about two and a half weeks ago when I started drinking this daily, I’ve dropped down to 187. I can’t say for sure it was only the drink, but I strongly suspect it helped me break that plateau. It seems to help manage my appetite and reduce cravings throughout the day, especially in a calorie deficit. It just makes me feel more balanced.

I’ve been experimenting with a homemade health drink for a while now, and I feel like I finally nailed a version that just works for me. It’s helped with digestion, energy, hydration, and just feeling more balanced overall.

Before this, I used to only go to the bathroom maybe once every few days. Now I go once a day, consistently — smooth, soft, and clean. My gut feels healthier than ever, and I know that’s not a fun thing to talk about, but it makes a massive difference.

I also don’t feel dehydrated anymore, even when I’m drinking coffee (which I also have daily, black). Between the minerals, electrolytes, fiber, and anti-inflammatory ingredients, I think this drink has just hit the right balance for my body. I’m more regular, my energy is steadier, and I genuinely enjoy the taste, especially the spice kick.

Some ingredients are a bit pricey (Full price breakdown at the bottom) but many are affordable, and it only takes 20 minutes to prep. I just wanted to share this in case someone else might benefit from it like I have.

I gave all the info to ChatGPT and had it help me write this up in a more readable way, but this is all based on my own results and experience.

I’ll share my exact 1.5L recipe and method below in case anyone’s interested.

This 1.5 L health tonic packs hydration, electrolytes, anti-inflammatory phytonutrients, fiber, protein, omega-3s, collagen support, and a 200 mg magnesium glycinate boost—perfect for chilling in your fridge and sipping throughout the next day.

""Push it, Aria. Come on, I know you've got more in the tank."" My adoptive brother Lucas called out with that drill-sergeant tone he always used during training.

Determined to prove him right, I hammered the leather punching bag harder, throwing in a complicated series of kicks and strikes. When I glanced back at him, I caught his slight nod of approval.

""Much better. Take five."" I walked over and collapsed next to the other young warriors in training.

Friday meant testing day with Lucas. Today we're doing strength demos, but sometimes it's sparring. My adoptive brother's a great teacher—he was trained by Gabriel, just like me.

Dad Gabriel is one of our pack's best fighters. He believes everyone—wolf or human—needs to defend themselves in this dangerous world. I've had his training since I was tiny, before joining the formal program.

Many think Gabriel should've become Head Warrior, but Alpha picked his buddy instead. Dad never complained though. After hunters killed my birth parents, Gabriel rescued me despite me being human.

Alpha Warren showed up today to watch us train. Lately, he makes me super uncomfortable—always staring and winking at me suggestively.

Pack gossip claims he's gone unstable since losing his mate. They say he calls young females to his quarters, and some don't survive. Many think Dylan should take over, but Alpha refuses, saying he's not ready.

Dylan seemed decent enough. Though I hadn't interacted with him much, he appeared fair and friendly to everyone in the pack. He was already 22 years old but still hadn't found his true mate.

I sat there, lost in my thoughts, when suddenly a massive shadow loomed over me. Looking up, I found Alpha Warren staring down at me before settling himself beside me.

""You're quite the skilled warrior, Aria, despite being human,"" he said, making no effort to hide the way his eyes raked over my body.

""Thank you, Alpha,"" I answered, trying my best to hide how uncomfortable I felt, which wasn't easy considering I was only wearing training shorts and a sports bra.

""And quite beautiful too."" His eyes traveled over me again, making my skin crawl and leaving me wishing I could just disappear.

Before I could respond, Lucas approached, respectfully greeted the Alpha, then told me training was wrapped up for the day. I jumped to my feet, beyond grateful for the escape route, and after a quick goodbye, I bolted from the training grounds.

I entered our small cabin and went straight to my room, peeling off my sweat-soaked training clothes before heading into the bathroom for a shower. After cleaning up, I pulled on a pair of forest-green suede pants and a cream-colored linen top. I rarely used makeup, but tonight I applied a soft pink lipstick that gave my lips a gentle, rosy tint.

Tonight's the big celebration for a girl in our pack who's finally coming of age. Everyone's pumped to watch her first shift and see if she finds her true mate. Finding your true mate is huge for werewolves—they're literally the other half of your soul.

As a human, I would never have a wolf spirit, never have the ability to shift, and never have a true mate. That was the biggest difference between me and the werewolf family that had adopted me. Sometimes, I felt lonely because of it.

At dinner time, I went downstairs to eat with Gabriel and Lucas. But unlike our usual pleasant conversations, tonight's atmosphere was quiet and tense. I didn't ask why, guessing that Gabriel must have had a stressful day.

""Aria?""

""Yeah, Gabriel?"" I looked up at him.

""I need you to pack a bag tomorrow. We're heading to the Moon Shadow Pack to visit some old friends of mine. We leave Sunday, so make sure you pack anything important you don't want to leave behind, because we'll be gone for quite a while."" He told me, his expression dead serious.

""What's going on?"" I asked.

""Got friends at Moon Shadow willing to take us in. Look, it's just... not safe here anymore. Our Alpha approved us visiting some relatives, and Moon Shadow's Alpha said yes."" There was something in his voice he wasn't telling me.

""Okay, Gabriel. I'll pack tomorrow."" I replied, and he gave me the smallest hint of a relieved smile.

After finishing dinner, I helped clear the dishes, then hugged Gabriel before preparing to head to the ceremony. Lucas accompanied me, since there was always the chance that tonight's newly-shifted female wolf might be his true mate. He'd grown increasingly eager to find her as soon as possible.

After an hour at the ceremony, we watched as the newly eighteen-year-old girl found her true mate among the boys who had recently completed their first shift. Witnessing how their souls pulled each other together, recognizing one another in a warm embrace filled with love, was truly magical. Although I knew I would never experience anything like it myself, I still felt happy for them.

I was lost in my thoughts again when I didn't notice someone approaching until they sat down beside me. I was surprised to see it was the Alpha's son, Dylan.

""Hey, Aria."" He greeted me with a friendly smile.

""Hello, Alpha Dylan,"" I answered respectfully.

""Come on, I'm not the Alpha yet, so just Dylan is fine."" He said with an easy smile, which I returned.

""So I hear you guys are heading to Moon Shadow Pack soon.""

""Yeah, we are,"" I confirmed, wondering silently how he knew about our plans.

""Smart move."" He said meaningfully, still smiling, then after a moment he got up to mingle with the other young wolves at the gathering.

The celebration continued. The music played. Wolves danced. All around me was joy, but I couldn't stop thinking about Gabriel's sudden decision. Something wasn't right. The way Dylan said ""smart move"" felt strange. Dangerous. I watched the pack members with new eyes now. I'd always been an outsider here. A human among werewolves. But I'd never felt unsafe until tonight.

A few hours later, Lucas found me, and we agreed to head home. As we left the venue and started on the path back, we heard someone calling our names, someone running toward us. Turning around, we were surprised to see Dylan.

""Lucas, Aria."" He called out to us, then spoke with urgency.

""I need a word with you both."" His eyes were intense, almost burning.

""What can we do for you, Dylan?"" Lucas stepped in, naturally taking the lead.

""Look, Lucas, hear me out, I'm trying to help you both."" He glanced around before lowering his voice, ""Look, when you get to Moon Shadow? Don't come back here. Ever. Especially you, Aria. It's the only place you'll be safe.""

""What the—"" I started to ask, but Lucas cut me off.

""We've got it handled, Dylan,"" Lucas gave Dylan a meaningful look, and Dylan nodded in understanding.

""Good. This sucks, and I'm sorry. I'm doing what I can to fix things here. Stay safe out there."" With that, he quickly walked away, leaving me with a million questions about what had just happened.

I turned to Lucas. His face was grim. Serious. Whatever was happening was bad.

""Lucas, what's going on?"" I whispered as we walked. The forest felt different now. Darker. Full of eyes.

""Not here,"" he murmured, constantly scanning around us. ""We'll talk at home. With Gabriel.""



Lucas refused to explain what Dylan had said or how he had responded, saying only that I would understand soon. Dad was already asleep when we got home, so we went straight to bed.

I woke up surprised the next morning when I realized Gabriel hadn't called me for our usual dawn run. Sunlight was already streaming through my window—a rare luxury. I stretched, feeling the pull in my muscles from yesterday's training, then slipped into a pair of sweatpants and a hoodie before heading downstairs.

Halfway down the staircase, I froze at the sound of hushed voices. Gabriel and Lucas were talking in the kitchen, their tones serious and low.

""Dad, she's onto us."" Lucas's voice dropped to a whisper.

""What makes you think that?"" Gabriel kept his voice low.

""Dylan cornered us after the bonfire last night. Said we should get her to Moon Shadow and stay put. Like, don't even think about coming back here.""

My heart hammered against my ribs. Dylan's weird warning suddenly made sense.

Gabriel let out a heavy breath. ""Gotta give it to the kid. He's nothing like his old man, especially since Tara passed.""

""Yeah, but Aria's getting suspicious. I don't think she actually knows what's up with the Alpha. But she's definitely been feeling off about him.""

""I'll give her the whole rundown once we're at Jace's place,"" Gabriel said. ""Can't talk freely here—walls have ears.""

I backed up the stairs, then stomped down loudly like I was just arriving. When I walked into the kitchen, Gabriel and Lucas looked suspiciously casual, coffee mugs in hand.

""Hey there, sleepyhead."" Gabriel's smile didn't reach his eyes. ""Crash okay?""

""Yeah, fine."" I poured myself some coffee. ""What, no brutal five a.m. workout today? Are you feeling alright?""

Gabriel snorted. ""Even drill sergeants get days off. Besides, you've got packing to do. We're rolling out at the crack of dawn tomorrow.""

I sat down and sipped my coffee, acting like I hadn't just eavesdropped on their whole conversation.

Back in my bedroom, I pulled out my largest duffel bag and began methodically folding clothes into it. Not just a few outfits—almost everything I owned. The practicality of Gabriel's instructions was clear now: we weren't planning a short visit.

In a smaller bag, I carefully placed my most precious possessions: my sketchbook, a few books, the silver bracelet that Isabella, Gabriel's late wife, had given me before she died. I felt a strange certainty that I wouldn't be returning to this cabin—the only home I'd known for ten years.

As I packed, memories flooded back. Gabriel teaching me to track in the forest. Lucas showing me how to throw a punch without breaking my thumb. The nights around the firepit where Gabriel would tell stories of the ancient wolf packs.

I paused, running my fingers over the wolf-paw birthmark on my left wrist. It was strange how a human like me had ended up in a world of werewolves. Sometimes I wondered if there was some deeper meaning to it, or if it was just cruel irony—a human with a wolf mark who could never shift.

When I came downstairs again, I found Gabriel on the phone in the kitchen. I sat quietly at the table, waiting for him to finish.

""That's awesome, thank you. We should roll in tomorrow evening, if all goes well."" His voice was relieved.

When he hung up, he turned to me with a smile. ""That was your grandmother Whitman. She's eager to see all of us.""

""Mom's parents are still at Moon Shadow?"" I asked.

Gabriel nodded. ""Yes. They've already arranged everything with Alpha Jace. You all packed??""

""Almost done,"" I confirmed. ""Just have a few more things to sort through.""

""Good."" He squeezed my shoulder. ""Stick around the house today. We've got a long drive ahead.""

I caught the hidden message: Don't go anywhere today. I nodded, understanding more than he realized.

Back in my room, boredom set in quickly. I put on my wireless headphones and scrolled through my music app. As a familiar song began to play, I closed my eyes, letting myself drift into memories.

Ten years ago. The night that changed everything.

I was seven years old, hiding in a cabinet as hunters broke into our home. Through the crack in the door, I watched my parents fall, their bodies crumpling under silver bullets. I bit my hand to keep from screaming, tasting copper as my teeth broke skin.

After what felt like hours, the shooting stopped. Heavy footsteps approached my hiding spot. When the cabinet door opened, I stared up into the amber eyes of a massive man with battle scars across his face.

""You're safe now, little one,"" Gabriel had said, his voice surprisingly gentle for such a fierce warrior. ""They're gone.""

Behind him stood a teenage boy—Lucas—his eyes wide with surprise at finding a human child.

""Dad, she's human,"" he'd whispered.

Gabriel had nodded. ""Yeah. And she's got nobody left.""

Some in the pack had opposed taking in a human child, but Gabriel stood firm. ""Those hunters took her family just like they've taken from us. She stays. End of discussion.""

My music suddenly cut out, interrupted by sounds from downstairs—sharp knocking at our front door. I pulled off my headphones, listening intently.

Gabriel answered the door with surprising speed. From my position at the top of the stairs, I could see Alpha Warren standing on our porch, flanked by two warriors. His massive frame filled the doorway, his expression severe.

""Gabriel,"" he said, voice cold. ""Thought I'd drop by. See how your... travel plans are coming along.""

The air crackled with tension as Gabriel invited him in, his posture calm but alert. I knew the signs—he was ready to fight if necessary.

""What's with the sudden road trip to Moon Shadow?"" Warren asked, pacing our living room.

""Just catching up with old friends,"" Gabriel replied evenly. ""Been too long since I've seen Jace.""

Warren's eyes swept the cabin, clearly searching for something—or someone. For me. I shrank back into the shadows of the upstairs hallway.

""And taking your... adopted stray with you?"" The way he said it made my skin crawl.

Lucas appeared at the bottom of the stairs, positioning himself protectively between Warren's line of sight and where I stood. ""We go as a family,"" he said firmly.

Warren studied them both before nodding. ""I'll send some guys to escort you to the border tomorrow. For protection.""

""We can manage,"" Gabriel said.

""I insist."" Warren's smile didn't reach his eyes. ""We'll be here at nine to see you off.""

After Warren left, Gabriel closed the door and locked it—something he rarely did. He and Lucas exchanged a worried look that confirmed my fears. Something was very wrong.

Dinner that night was tense. Gabriel placed our food on the table, then sat down with an expression that told me he'd made a decision.

""Aria,"" he said finally, ""there's stuff you need to know.""

1khse6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/1khse6i/how_crucial_is_the_relationship_between_artistry/,How crucial is the relationship between artistry and emotional sensitivity?,"Hi. Without going into too much personal detail, I've experienced an extreme number of setbacks and disappointments over the last year that've just kneecapped me. Whatever. I took the hit and kept walking. But, already an overly cerebral person, I woke up the other day and realized - wow! I have become totally cut off from my emotions. Like the power's been inexplicably shut off in my house. Like: wtf's going on? I know I paid the bill - so why is it dark in here? And now I can't find my way out.

I've stopped listening to music - it's too much. I've stopped watching films. I'm reading only books about astrophysics. I am not a crier. Since I was eight, I've maybe cried a handful of times - I am crying at random all the time for no reason. Yesterday, I drove past a billboard with a picture of a cat on it and just burst into tears, I couldn't explain it or make it stop, it was less like crying and more like my eyes had sprung a leak. I try to reach out to others but my relationships with family and friends seem stuck in stasis. I don't believe in ""signs"" but it's like the world is holding up one giant sign reading: **NO**. Literally, I went to the beach to jump start my emotions? And when I got there it was - I'm not joking - so obscured by fog that I couldn't see the ocean. I drove away telling myself over and over: ""it's cool, you're fine, it's cool"", got home, tried to write and everything that came out was sterile and soulless. That was months ago. I lost an afternoon researching ""broken heart syndrome"" since everything that had inspired me or filled my heart with joy has just - gone.

So the question is this: as an artist, is not the ability to feel things deeply intrinsic to the vitality and integrity of your craft? I've always believed writer's block is bullshit but this seems like something different - a kind of death. Do you think this is something I can work through? Or should I step back? Investigate my needs, stitch my heart back together, locate a well of inspiration? Every time I put my hand to a pen, I shut down, become physically ill. Is this just my mind depressing itself in order to avoid completing a project? I'm an inveterate workaholic who lives off of coffee and sugar and I am straight up terrified of facing this dragon that is eating me alive.",3,1746716768.0,entp,2,1.0,False

The Characters – Or 'What Went Before'  
  
Charlotte:  
  
Originally known as 'Jennifer Conners' (Jenny) when she was a child. Charlotte had a grim upbringing. Imprisoned in a 'Children's Home' known as 'Blessingmoors', actually an outlet for human trafficking, she never knew her mother and father, and was destined for a life as s\*x-slave.  
  
To escape that life, Charlotte decided to go to university to give herself the education to make it in the world. To raise the funds to do so, she chose to auction herself and her virginity to the highest bidder.  
  
James and Michael:  
  
Charlotte's 'Buyer' was James, long-term Dom, architect-engineer, divorced and stinging from his first marriage. During a madcap week of wild s\*\*\*\*l adventure (See 'Mastering the Virgin' – Box Set One -  FREE Download), James introduced Charlotte to the pleasures of b\*\*m and ménage with his old friend Michael, who 'loves women'. Blond, and unusually handsome, Michael lived the life of the 'Bachelor Free' for many years until he met Charlotte.  
  
Over time, James became Charlotte's Master. Michael became, first her 'Golden Lover', then her fiancée, and finally her husband. The three formed a Triad, now travelling through life in a three-cornered marriage.  
  
Charlotte is now pregnant by James.  
  
Mitch:  
  
Michelle Kimberley - Charlotte/Jenny's mother. Driven to escape from a suffocating childhood, Mitch ran away from home at the age of fifteen. She survived by becoming a high-class courtesan, eventually becoming involved with:  
  
Klempner:  
  
Lawrence (Larry) Klemper: ex-mercenary and human trafficker. During an affair with Mitch, before understanding the kind of man he was, she became pregnant by him. Realising too late that she was involved with a dangerous criminal, she ran, eventually marrying Klempner's friend, Frank Conners, and passing Jennifer off as his child.  
  
Klempner swore revenge, pursuing the couple. When Jennifer was two years old, Klempner captured her, imprisoning her in Blessingmoors. Mitch, believing her daughter was dead, went into hiding for over twenty years.  
  
After events in which many truths were revealed, Klempner came to understand that he had not been betrayed and gave up his revenge. Regretting his past actions, he agreed to walk out of Mitch's life and to allow her to find happiness on her own terms.   
  
Richard and Beth:  
  
Richard Haswell, billionaire property developer and Dom, owner of a significant proportion of 'The City' and first, James' employer then his co-director.  
  
Elizabeth: his wife and sub and related by blood to Charlotte.  
  
Over time, the couple have become close friends with the Triad, and now are part of a developing polyamorous marriage. Richard and James share their pleasures with Charlotte. Michael is Beth's 'second husband'.  
  
Now read on...  
  
Michael - Eleven Weeks  
  
I lie awake, an arm propped behind my head. Lying beside me; Charlotte, eyes closed, her breathing steady and slow. Beyond her, James, the rise and fall of his chest equally regular.   
  
Richard and Beth are in the next room. Perhaps they're sleeping. I'm not sure. It seems to me I sometimes hear a low murmur of words.  
  
But, my mind a-whirl, sleep escapes me.  
  
Should I get up?  
  
Make a coffee? Read perhaps...  
  
But right now, I don't want to leave the bed or my sleeping wife. For her perhaps to wake and find me not here.  
  
So, tossing and turning, I while away the darkness, watching slanted moonbeams make their slow progression across the carpet, then the bed, before finally fading. And now the first grey light of dawn creeps across the windows.  
  
A blackbird chirrups its early arpeggio; a sweet melodic prelude to the full chorus that will follow.  
  
And still my mind wheels and turns.  
  
The sheer enormity of what Richard has offered me takes my breath away.  
  
Beth.  
  
Beautiful, sweet, submissive Beth. So like my own Charlotte physically. But so unlike in her every other way.  
  
Richard's wife. His submissive. So much younger than he is.  
  
And he has... What? Bequeathed her to me?  
  
A second wife?  
  
And Charlotte says she doesn't mind. Even encourages it.  
  
As does James.  
  
Why?  
  
I roll onto my side, settling to watch my sleeping flame-haired beauty.  
  
And gradually, it dawns on me that her breathing is not the slow steady rhythm of the sleeper...  
  
She's not asleep...  
  
Pretending?  
  
""Charlotte?""  
  
Her eyes flick open. Not the gradual flutter of the slowly waking, but the snap of the already conscious. And her gaze settles on me. In the daylight, that gaze would be emerald, but now, in the early dawn, she is a pattern of light and shade; a tracery in grey, her eyes a white gleam.  
  
She shifts, crisp linen sheets rustling in the semi-dark and her hand cups my cheek. ""You okay?"" She leans in, brushing her lips over mine.  
  
""Shouldn't I be asking you that?""  
  
Her body vibrates; quiet laughter. ""I'm fine. Really, I am. Richard asked me before he spoke to you. So..."" She strokes my face. ""... Are you okay?""  
  
""I'm not sure. It's hard to put into words...""  
  
""Overwhelm?"" A glint from her teeth joins that from her eyes.  
  
""That's as good a description as any... Charlotte...""  
  
""You're not changing your mind, are you? About Beth?""  
  
""I'm... I don't know. Charlotte, are you sure you're alright about this? It's not every woman who'd be happy for her husband to have a second wife.""  
  
She chuckles. ""It's not every man who would accept that his wife has two husbands. But you're right. If it were any other woman than Beth, no, I wouldn't have accepted it."" The chuckle turns to a snort. ""I'd have scratched her freakin' eyes out."" Her voice softens. ""But it is Beth...""  
  
I reach for her, sliding an arm around her waist, pulling her, warm and yielding, to me  
  
She snuggles close, contouring herself to my body, nuzzling into the nook of my neck and shoulder. ""You smell good.""  
  
""Charlotte, I promised you on our wedding night that you would never have cause to regret marrying me.""  
  
""Yes, you did. And you never have given me cause.""  
  
""Not even now? A bit of partying with Richard and Beth on special occasions is one thing, but this...""  
  
She pulls away, leaning back so she can look me in the face. ""Have you changed your mind? Yesterday evening you agreed to it, but we were all there. If you said yes to Richard because you were feeling pressured or for the wrong reasons...""  
  
""No, I wasn't pressured. That's not it. It's... you did spring it on me. You obviously all knew about it before. You'd discussed it. I had two minutes' notice.""  
  
She sits up, knees hugging up to the slight swell of her belly, pulling the sheets to her chest. ""If you want to change your mind, you should do it sooner rather than later. Beth and Richard would understand if it happened now. Later...""  
  
""I don't want to change my mind... exactly... But I wanted to talk to you about it. Talk it through. Last night, we didn't discuss anything... There was no opportunity to discuss anything... About how it would work. Are we a... a five-some? Or are we an overlapping couple and our Triad. Who would live where? Or when we might all meet up. Or... anything...""  
  
""That's all detail.""  
  
""I know it's detail. We can work through it. But... but mainly... I have to be certain that you are alright with this.""  
  
""Michael, I've already...""  
  
I cut her off, sitting up to look her in the eye. ""Charlotte, I never expected to meet a woman where not only do I want to be faithful to her, I have no inclination to be otherwise. You never asked me to be faithful to you, but it's something I have always wanted to do for you. My gift to you. The only woman I've touched since you and I met is Beth herself, and you agreed, even encouraged that.""  
  
A finger of sunlight creeps across the carpet, the light turning from grey to golden. Her mouth twitches mischief. ""How many have you had?""  
  
""What? How many what?"" I'm protesting, pretending innocence, but I understand exactly what she's asking. I simply don't want to answer her.  
  
""Women. How many women have you had? Before me.""  
  
""I never counted.""  
  
The mischief dances into her eyes. ""You never counted your conquests?""  
  
""Women aren't conquests. And they're not numbers either.""  
  
She jerks a thumb to the sleeping James at her side. ""Marcie said that the two of you had... what were her words? 'Worked every sub within twenty miles'...""  
  
Fucking Marcie...  
  
""How about your own past?""  
  
Her forehead creases. ""What about my past? You know how we met..."" She colours up. ""The Auction...""  
  
""Yes, James bought you and he invited me in the following day. But after that week, you went to college. What happened there?""  
  
""What do you mean? What happened?""  
  
""You had no boyfriends at college? After that first week? You'd discovered you enjoyed sex.""  
  
""I... there were a couple. I had a date or two. But it never..."" She stutters to a halt.   
  
""I'm guessing it was a bit pale compared to what James and I give you?""  
  
She nods down to her knees, looking forlorn. ""Yes.""  
  
You bastard...  
  
""Babe, I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. The fact is, I have a past. Everyone does.""  
  
""Do you miss it?""  
  
""Miss what? Playing the field?""  
  
""Yes. You had so much freedom when you were single and I wondered, maybe...""  
  
""I think about it sometimes, but if by miss it, you mean, do I want to go back to that? No, I don't. I have you.""  
  
""And now Beth too.""  
  
""And now, Beth."" Framing her face with my hands, ""But that doesn't change in any way how I feel about you, or the fact that you are my wife and I am your husband.""  
  
""I know that."" She smiles, leaning in to meet me half-way and we kiss.   
  
She breaks off. ""Ahh... damn.""  
  
""What?""  
  
She pats her stomach. ""I need to pee.""   
  
I shift to let her past and she climbs out of the bed, supporting her stomach with one hand and clutching at her breasts with the other. ""I'm going to have to wear a bra in bed if these damn things get any bigger.""  
  
""They look pretty good to me. But I suspect they'll getter bigger than that. It's early days yet.""  
  
She gives me a slow look then vanishes off into the bathroom, leaving me with the 'sleeping' James.  
  
""You're not fooling me. I know you're awake.""  
  
His eyes flick open, his mouth quirking with humour. ""And have been for some time. I'll admit, I was enjoying the turn the conversation had taken. I would have liked to hear more.""  
  
""You didn't want to join in?""  
  
""You had things you needed to talk through with Charlotte.""  
  
""You could say that, yes. You shared her with me, arranged that I married her and now you've conspired to give me a second wife. Competition for her affections.""  
  
He stares up for a moment, sucking at his cheeks. ""I don't know that conspired is the right word...""  
  
""Oh, I think it is.""  
  
He sniffs. ""Alright, it is. In the same way that you and Charlotte arranged that her first child would be mine...""   
  
""That's what friends do for each other.""  
  
""And this is what friends do for each other. There's no question between you and me of competition for Charlotte's affection. There's no jealousy between her and Beth. And you're perfectly capable of giving each of them what they need and deserve. We all had good reasons for the things we did.""  
  
He sits up, scraping at a blue haze of stubble. ""No one should have to deal with what Ben did to you, for all that he convinced himself he was doing it on your behalf. Klempner had it right when he talked about betrayal.""  
  
Klempner...

*Game Start Time: 12:00PM PST (3:00 EST)*



**Why This Pick?**

Detroit starter Casey Mize (2.70 ERA) is undoubtedly the better arm in today’s matchup, friends. To boot, the Tigers last 7 straight wins have been by 2 or more runs. With the Rockies starting Kyle Freeland (5.70 ERA), my money is undoubtedly on Detroit to pull off another victory over Colorado this afternoon and cover the RL.

I toured a farm that grows Pacamara and the rare Bernardina variety, got a behind-the-scenes look at the cherry-to-bean process, and even did a tasting straight from the source.

I’m a huge fan of specialty coffee, but this was next-level. The volcanic soil, altitude, and processing methods created flavor notes I hadn’t experienced before. I documented the journey in a video, and if you’re into origin stories, tasting notes, or just love coffee, I think you’ll enjoy it.

The New Bath Guide (1766) Letter 13 ‘A Public Breakfast’ Christopher Anstey 1724–1805 English writer

Thomas Mann 1875–1955 German novelist

1 Unsere Fähigkeit zum Ekel ist, wie ich anmerken möchte, desto grösser, je lebhafter unsere Begierde ist, das heisst: je inbrünstiger wir eigentlich der Welt und ihren Darbietungen anhangen.

Our capacity for disgust, let me observe, is in proportion to our desires; that is in proportion to the intensity of our attachment to the things of this world. The Confessions of Felix Krull (1954) pt. 1, ch. 5 (translated by Denver Lindley)

‘Is there any other point to which you would wish to draw my attention?’ ‘To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.’ ‘The dog did nothing in the night-time.’ ‘That was the curious incident,’ remarked Sherlock Holmes. The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1894) ‘Silver Blaze’

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 1859-1930

Religious teaching, that is, the explanation of the purpose and meaning of life, should be the basis of any education. People think that it is no crime to lie to children, and that to lie to children is not really very wrong, but even sometimes necessary. But it is clear that with children you should be especially careful and honest about what you say to them.

Tolstoy, A Calendar of Wisdom

The life of the nation is secure only while the nation is honest, truthful, and virtuous. speech on the 23rd anniversary of Emancipation in the District of Columbia, Washington DC, April 1885

Nothing great is created suddenly, anymore than a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig, I answer you that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen. EPICTETUS

All true spiritual development takes place little by little. From day to day you seem to make no progress, but when you glance back to the year before, though you have vastly farther to go, you realize that your nervous system is more resilient, your will stronger, your senses more responsive, your mind and relationships more secure; your goal is that much clearer before your eyes. It is not very helpful to ask, “Why am I not making much progress? Why are there still so many difficulties in my way? Why can’t I surmount them?” It takes time and labor, but the tree will bear fruit. EKNATH EASWARAN

On those remote pages [of the Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge] it is written that animals are divided into (a) those that belong to the Emperor, (b) embalmed ones, (c) those that are trained, (d) suckling pigs, (e) mermaids, (f) fabulous ones, (g) stray dogs, (h) those that are included in this classification, (i) those that tremble as if they were mad, (j) innumerable ones, (k) those drawn with a very fine camel's hair brush, (l) others, (m) those that have just broken a flower vase, (n) those that resemble flies from a distance.

1khs6dq,https://i.redd.it/yr1yxo0ynkze1.jpeg,Welcome! I create LEGO instructions for LEGO Fortnite builds,"Hello there! If you've landed on my profile, you've probably seen some of the LEGO build instructions I've been sharing. My main thing is creating step-by-step guides and parts lists so you can build items and structures from LEGO Fortnite using real LEGO bricks.

To be clear, the original designs for these builds come from Epic Games and The LEGO Group. What I do is figure out how to translate those in-game models into something you can actually build in real life, dealing with things like finding available parts in the right colors or making adjustments for stability since the game doesn't always follow real-world physics. My contribution is the instructions and curating the parts lists to make it possible.

Creating these instructions still takes time and effort though: from analyzing the in-game models to building them digitally, putting the guides together, and then writing and posting about them. If you find my instructions helpful and want to support what I do, you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/atubatan)! It's a simple way to contribute and helps me keep making more instructions.

I would especially love going to places like TJMaxx, HoneGoods, Target, etc. just to see what scores I could find. This was amplified by my mom's love of shopping and seeing videos of ""hauls"" online, too.

Then Target rolled back their DEI initiatives, so I boycotted them. Suddenly, I had time on the weekend now to go to the park/playground with my kid instead of getting a cake pop/coffee and buying shit. Then the money started staying in my account instead of being spent frivolously. I started to realize how much I time/energy/money I was wasting on my Target runs. I felt better. 

But yesterday, I ran to HomeGoods to grab cards. They're made well and don't cost an arm and a leg. I usually buy them on clearance and keep a stash at the house for birthdays and other occasions, but ran out yesterday. When I walked in, I was honestly grossed out by the sheer amount of stuff there. I took a lap to see if there was anything fun and realized all the joy of consuming for consumption's sake was gone. Everything looked crappy and utterly unnecessary. I grabbed the 2 cards I needed and left.

I never thought I would see this day and I honestly think this group has helped me. There's no joy in over consuming. I'm glad to finally see that.",125,1746716233.0,Anticonsumption,12,0.99,False

I had my daughter 2.5 years ago, I actually was a pre-pregnancy weight not long after birth but I suffered with PPD, drowning daily in learning how to be a mom, a GOOD mom unlike my own mother while dealing with years-long anxiety and in between feedings, diaper changes, a moments peace...I'd snack and binge but... This time I'm not doing it for me (completely,) I'm doing it for my daughter so that I will be here for a long time to come, so that I can run around with her and hopefully add to our family.

So on April 21, I downloaded a few calorie counters including Myfitnesspal but ultimately have stuck with Cronometer. I used online calculators as well. And so they fluctuate, I understand these things are estimates but here why I worry my deficit isn't much of a deficit.

I'm 33, female, work 40 hours at a desk job but my husband works very long hours so I'm up on my feet by 530/630 most days, I do the early morning potty trip with daughter, daycare drop off. then I work 8 hours, leave pick her up etc. I usually don't sit down until after she's gone to bed and I've finished packing my lunch and cleaning up so if I do get to sit down before going to bed, it can be 930/10pm **so am I correct in choosing sedentary lifestyle?**

My calorie limit per day is 1420 and I weigh roughly 168, I'd like to get down to 150 as a starting goal and I do measure everything, I never did before because how many calories could possibly be in a tbs of oil? or a smear of peanut butter (turns out quite a bit.)

1khs2f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1khs2f3/explore_if_the_cuisinart_ss15bksp1_coffee_maker/,Explore if the Cuisinart SS-15BKSP1 coffee maker delivers versatile brewing experience review,"Testing the **Cuisinart SS-15BKSP1 Coffee Maker** has certainly been an interesting journey. I’ve brewed countless pots of coffee and juggled single-serve options to assess how well it caters to enthusiasts like me. This sleek, dual-function coffee maker combines a 12-cup carafe brewer with a single-serve brewing system, making it a versatile device that fits various coffee-drinking styles. From its thoughtful design to the nitty-gritty of its functionality, this machine has been given a workout in my kitchen.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that grabs your attention is its modern black and stainless steel build. The metallic finish gives the unit a polished, high-end feel, and at 10.13” x 10.38” x 14.25”, it’s compact enough to fit neatly on most kitchen countertops. It blends in effortlessly with contemporary kitchen décor while promising durability. The dual functionality is separated clearly—one side for the 12-cup carafe and the other for single servings, making the setup intuitive even on sleepy mornings.

**Ease of Use**  
Starting off my day bleary-eyed has genuinely never been easier. The simple button-based interface feels natural, and having the carafe on one side and single-serving options on the other minimizes confusion. The reusable HomeBarista™ filter cup is a gem for anyone trying to cut back on disposable cups or experiment with their own coffee blends. A variable strength control for the carafe side, with a bold option for stronger brews, adds a personal touch to every pot. The single-serve brewer allows 6, 8, or 10 oz serving sizes—perfect for my family with diverse coffee drinking habits.

**Perks**  
- Dual functionality: Seamlessly supports both carafe brewing and single-serve coffee pods.  
- Flexibility: The ability to switch between K-Cups or ground coffee is a genuine win.  
- Hot coffee every time: Brew temperatures are perfect; no lukewarm disappointments.  
- Sleek design: Stainless steel adds a touch of luxury.  

**Ease of Access to Water Tank and Filters**  
Water replenishment has been a mixed bag for me. The carafe brewing side offers a simple process—just fill the carafe via its water level indicator and pour it into the reservoir. However, limited access to the single-serve water reservoir can be slightly inconvenient, especially for someone in a rush. A removable 40 oz reservoir for single servings is a godsend for someone constantly brewing. It also features a charcoal water filter, ensuring that each cup brews with filtered water, making a noticeable difference in taste.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- **Energy efficiency**: An energy save mode makes me feel a little less guilty when I forget to turn it off.  
- **Personalized brewing experience**: Adjustable carafe temperature and automatic brew-start programming.  
- **Drip tray options**: Accommodates travel mugs for mornings when I’m rushing out the door.

**Who Can Benefit the Most?**  
This coffee maker is designed for households with varying coffee needs. My mornings involve preparing large batches for the family, but the single-serve side has been ideal for mid-day or evening brews. Individuals who want a versatile solution will undoubtedly appreciate its dual functionality. Office users will also find the carafe option efficient for serving a group, and the programmable settings ensure that coffee is ready whenever needed.

**Limitations**  
- Access to the single-serve water tank requires more effort than I’d like.  
- The unit is slightly taller compared to other coffee makers, which could mean a tight squeeze under low cabinets.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- **Water splashes**: Using the single-serve option with smaller mugs sometimes causes minor splatter.  
- **Reservoir design**: Could benefit from improved accessibility.  

**Competitive Options**  
Having compared it to the Keurig K-Duo and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the dual functionality on the Cuisinart edges out its competitors. The Keurig K-Duo has a bulkier presence and lacks the sleek stainless steel design that the SS-15BKSP1 offers. While Hamilton Beach FlexBrew shares a similar versatility with dual brewing features, I’ve noticed that it doesn’t extract coffee flavors as fully as the Cuisinart does. Not to mention, the durable build and fewer issues with leaks on the Cuisinart have given me more confidence in its longevity.

**Affordable Quality**  
For everything it offers—from programmable carafe functions to single-brew customization—the financial value of this coffee maker is fair. While it’s priced higher than simpler models, the sophistications in brewing options, including the BOLD strength control, removable drip tray, and energy save mode, feel worth every penny. If coffee is central to navigating your day, as it is for me, investing a bit more in quality is reasonable.

1khs0tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicArena/comments/1khs0tg/i_went_to_hell/,I went to Hell,"I died. I thought I lived a pretty decent life but nevertheless I wound up in Hell. Surprisingly, it turns out the Mormons were right all along. So before you get too cocky, just know that if you’ve ever partaken in tea or coffee, you’ll wind up there too. 

When I “arrived” I was informed by a demon that a unique punishment had been designed especially for me. I started to envision myself being horribly maimed and tortured, but he led me over to an ornate, ancient looking desk, upon which set a desktop computer. It had one program: Magic: the Gathering Arena. I looked at the Demon and he nodded. I booted it up.

“Do I have to build a deck?” I asked

“The deck has been chosen”, said the demon.

I saw that I had one deck, my trusty Jeskai Convoke build, circa 2025 Standard.

“Should I just ladder or what?”

“The opponent has been chosen” said the demon. 

Just then another demon sat at an identical desk and computer across from me. 

“Begin”. 

We got into the match. I kept a decent opener and my demon opponent went first, playing a plains. That’s ironic, I thought. I would have expected a demon to play black. But then, the demon tapped his plains playing a [[Hinterland Sanctifier]]. I was playing against mono-white lifegain. It was at that moment that I understood everything. 

Jeskai Convoke is a bit of a meta deck. It plays a bunch of weak dorks to go wide, and prey upon removal-laden fancy pants midrange decks. The downside is that you get destroyed by basically any deck that can reliably play decent creatures on a curve. It’s especially hopeless if those creatures gain life and get bigger in the process. You could say this particular matchup feels like torture.

I played a [[Novice Inspector]] and passed. My demon opponent played [[Ajani’s Pridemate]], triggering Sanctifier, which in turn triggered the Pridmate, making it a 3/3. I could see the hint of a smile appear on the demon’s face. 

I passed the turn, holding up an already irrelevant [[Resolute Reinforcements]]. My opponent played [[Essence Channeler]], and there was a flurry of lifegain triggers. 

“God, I am so good at Magic”, I heard my opponent mutter. It wasn’t long before the game was out of reach and I conceded. 

“Again”.

We must of played a thousand matches like that. I was keeping it together but I could feel my sanity slipping, until one day, I finally won. 

In short, I had the nuts. T2 [[Gleeful Demolition]] into [[Knight-Errant of Eos]], into T3 Gleeful into another Knight Errant. I topped it off with an [[Imodane's Recruiter]] and swung for a million, dealing just enough to get through my opponent’s already outrageous life total. 

I expected us to move on to some new and even more exotic punishment, but the demon only said:

“Again” 

Not long after, a new card started showing up in my opponent’s deck. 

= = = = = = 

Fluffy Bunny - W

Creature - Rabbit

Whenever a counter is placed on a creature you control, you gain 1 life.
 
1 / 2

= = = = = = 

It took me one millisecond to realize this went infinite with Ajani’s Pridemate. And that is exactly how I lost the next 10,000 matches. I tried my best with my [[Spyglass Siren]]s and 1/1 tokens, but it was never close. My opponent's side was an impenetrable wall of huge lifelinking bunnies, cats, and bats. It was a strategy that was both so utterly reckless and arrogant in its linearity. Any sweeper would completely hose them. I thought about the [[Split Up]] in my sideboard, but alas I could not access them. This was arena best of one - aka Hell. 

= = = =

It was probably our 20,000th game. My opponent had gone [[Healer’s Hawk]] into Ajani’s Pridemate into Essence Channeler into Fluffy Bunny. The demon looked at me from over his screen. 

“Do you concede?”

I surveyed the battlefield. I had a Spyglass Siren, a map token, and a Nesting Bot. It was impossible to win. I was delirious from all the games, I was exhausted. I was helpless. but something snapped in me. 

“No”. I said. 
“Play it out”.

The Demon raised an eyebrow. Fluffy Bunny resolved and the screen became electric with triggers. Counters, Counters, lifegain, Counters, Counters, lifegain. The demon became frenzied. 

“I am so good at this GAME!!!” He bellowed

The screen was a blur of shimmery trigger animations. I watched, and my sanity finally slipped away entirely. “Play it out” I slurred. “Play… it.. out…”

Centuries passed, Eons passed. Ajani’s Pride Mate was a 10^23453466 / 10^23453466. I was in a stupor until a new sensation entered my awareness. It was a burning smell - but not the typical fire and brimstone burning smell that I had become accustomed to. Was that, burning plastic? 

I looked at my monitor. Triggers were still flying everywhere, but the screen began to flicker. It felt as if all of hell had gotten a bit darker. I heard an alarm in the distance and I could hear Demons sprinting nearby. Sparks began flying from my computer, and then, an explosion. 

= = = =

I woke up on the street to my friend leaning over me. 

“Holy shit dude are you okay? That car ran right into you!”

Needless to say I am not okay. But I gave up coffee, and I’m never touching Arena again.",79,1746715849.0,MagicArena,24,0.75,False

“You know it!” she replies with a grin as she shuffles her paperwork into a neat pile in front of her. “Rough night?”   
  
“Urgg, you don’t know the half of it.” I answer, dropping the pile of files in my hands and throwing myself down onto my chair.

I let out a deep breath and rub my tired eyes before clicking on the internet icon on my desktop.   
  
Jane sighs in defeat. “What’s the plan then?” she asks seriously.   
  
“One of my informants has some information for me. I’ll meet up with him later and find out if he’s full of s\*\*t or not.”  I shrug, staring at the swirling icon in front of me as the screen buffers over and over again. “The guy is easily spooked though. He only ever wants to meet at night- f\*\*\*\*\*g hell… What the hell is wrong with this thing?!” I moan, clicking on the icon again furiously.   
  
Jane laughs out loud, shaking her head as she reaches for her own coffee.   
  
“Someone has some serious rage to work out… or maybe someone just reallyyyy needs to get laid.” she states, raising her eyebrow at me playfully.   
  
“What I need is some decent WiFi in this place.” I quip in return.

This weekend we are gearing up for a great **hybrid** meeting this Saturday, May 10, 2025 at 9am. Address/Zoom details are available upon request by emailing [VenturaCountyCCL@gmail.com](mailto:VenturaCountyCCL@gmail.com)

What's on the agenda? Our chapter has hit the ground running and is increasing our efforts in state and local government as well as the community. You'll hear from volunteer team leads about engaging with our climate groups within our coalition to advocate for critical legislation. A member of our presentations team will tell us about their recent experience sharing a climate action presentation at California Lutheran University.  We will also discuss our success tabling at Earth Day events, having letters to the editor published, and the launch of our Coffee and Climate sessions -- a great way to connect socially and share information with each other!

We have a post card writing session planned for the remainder of our meeting time. Our partnership with Environmental Voter Project involves engaging with people that identify as environmentalists, but tend to be low propensity voters.

We would be remiss if we did not wish a Happy Mother's Day to all the Moms and Mother figures in all our lives. It's more important now than ever to take care of one another, our communities, and Mother Earth. Keep advocating, keep writing, keep calling, keep showing up -- it makes a world of difference!

We are also looking for volunteers that are interested in participating at the city, county, and state level. Our Chapter needs help with preparing talking points, developing a calendar, posting on social media, and organizing groups to speak at city council meetings.

So I went ahead and made a discord and subreddit r/ForzaCoffeeAndCars! On the sub Reddit will be the link for the discord. 

Hope is for like minded people who aren’t spending hours in the AH to be able to find each other and meet/go for drives! 

 I would also like to do a weekly/monthly “Themed” meet, that has a winner for said theme!

This is very much a work in progress, and very new to running a server so please bear with me. I’m very open to criticism and ideas (if this already exists please just ignore me 😂)",0,1746715731.0,ForzaHorizon,0,0.33,False

I’ll also be painting the trim, window, and door frames in the same color, since I plan to add picture frame moulding and a chair rail. Should I get a separate can in satin or semi-gloss for those areas, or is it okay to use the same eggshell finish? This room will be the nursery, so I want to make sure it’s both durable and cohesive on a budget. Thanks!

I bought my espresso machine 3 days ago, so I am very new to this. Please go easy on me.

Below is what I am getting.

I am using 15g of store-bought coffee beans (I know, I know—I'll buy fresh beans this weekend) weighed in the portafilter after grinding, ground at setting 12 on my Baratza Encore ESP grinder. I started at setting 17 and could not even fit 14 grams into the portafilter with the double-shot pressurized basket.

I then use a puck to level, tamp, and use a razor to ensure I have an okay level and tamp again.

It is taking only 13.75 seconds for the shot to start pulling from the espresso machine and takes 28.66 seconds total.  The double shot weighs 46 grams. Not even close to the 1:2 ratio.

Should I keep grinding finer, or is something wrong with the grinder/espresso machine? Can the coffee beans have this much of an impact?

I am seeing decent crema on the espresso shot, so that makes me wonder if it is the equipment and not the beans.

Thanks

I'd describe it as a chemical/hospital smell, my wife described it as an odd, clean smell. It now happens every time you make coffee with it. (We are not drinking these coffees, just troubleshooting.)

No steam escaping from the machine, it isn't getting particularly hot anywhere, there are no outward signs of anything wrong (scorching or bubbled plastic). The smell only happens after you make coffee--not when it is warming up. 

Illy themselves were of no help. We bought another Y3.3 because we have a mountain of capsules. Still, I'd like to figure out what happened to the first one, and if possible, to fix it.

I find it poetic that you bowed out just as V entered the picture. 

Thanks for being another ear to my confusion over P's kiss-and-run disappearing act. Technically, you also kind of faded out, but that's much more understandable. 

We agreed that P was character development (hilariously, around the same time that I vented to a cousin about P and she was *indignant* and insisted on egging his building, which I did not agree with lol). Maybe, at least in my story, you were an area-specific NPC that offers tea and a chat.

I hope all is well with you and you are somewhere along your healing journey.

-------


To the one who addressed me as ""a woman I thought was my friend,""

I am happy that you're warming up to other people who are not me.

I keep telling myself that I would like to clear things up, but there's a part of me that says, ""Nope, it will end with her spiraling and you fawning and keeping her from spiraling, yet again."" So this remains an unsent letter.

I noticed that I can't see your posts on that common writing site of ours anymore, for better or for best. For the longest time, I kept my posts private and held myself back from taking a peek at what else you'd written about me. 

I could have blocked you, so that we wouldn't be able to see each other's posts, but I never did. Because I was afraid you'd notice that I blocked you and warp this information into another tool to hurt yourself with. 

I was also afraid that you wouldn't just pine after ""how things were"" but drag clueless V into your writing. Because you felt that he was taking me away from you. 

No, dear, V never took me from anyone. 

I myself took a step back.

I stepped away mainly because I was (and still am) reeling from how loaded our interactions have turned out to be. All the unspoken expectations placed on my shoulders, all the mind-reading I was somehow supposed to do, the anger you told me you felt when I treated myself to a solo coffee date, the way my stomach turned when you said that you are *~attuned~* to me, and those conversations where I wanted to explain myself but ended up having to comfort you and keep you from slipping further ...

And, okay, secondly because I did sense the jealousy towards my new relationship and it made me more upset.

I still don't have all the words for this.

But if you're tired, I'm tired, too.

I also wish you healing.

1khrpse,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1khrpse/hr_the_last_broadcast/,[HR] The Last Broadcast,"\- It's a beautiful night with a pale full moon in the sky. Moonlight rays bathing the world below in a milky-glass tint. Seated in my chair, I prepare for duty. In this line of work, one must be always sharp and punctual sure to never miss a night. -

Gene was at the end of his shift as a waiter in a lousy cafe'. The last guest had only just left as Gene was cleaning the tables and gathering up the  spice shakers to bring in the back of the kitchen. He looked outside the windows, the road was quiet and still.

""The moon is beautiful tonight."" He commented in the silence.

Everyone else already left and was his duty to close shop. The only perceptible sounds were the slow whirring of the ceiling fans and the ticking of the clock signing twenty-three and fifty with its hands. Cold air seeped from under the door, making the man shiver.

""I hate closing. This place gives me the creeps at this hour.""

Gathering up the remaining cutlery, he remembered the old FM radio that was on the counter. Maybe some tunes could have eased his mind. He flicked the power switch; the old contraption emitted a low static sound. Gene reached for the knob and twisted it for a while looking for a station to listen to, and in the middle of the various broadcasts, connected to a channel playing ""sleepwalk"", one of his favorite songs. It was a melancholic song with an aura of mystery to it. Picking up the broom, he brushed the floors listening to it; by then the ceiling fans had stopped whirring and the clock struck twelve.

Suddenly a sharp noise came from the radio.

A cutting static noise that lasted for a few seconds; the lights flickered for a moment and then quiet. A sharp crackle, followed by a gentle, husky voice.

""You are listening to 140.8 FM. The moon is bright, the air is thin and if you are listening to this... well you may be the only one. Tonight's tale comes from a little place in the city that you may or may not know about.""

Gene was surprised to the sudden change of radio station as he kept going with his duties. He looked once again outside the windows; a curtain of darkness falling over the streets.

""...Thats odd"" he muttered, brows furrowing ""Wasn't supposed to be cloudy."" he leaned closer to the glass. The moon was gone. Just  flat suffocating darkness. Squinting across the road, there was a shape – veiled in shadow and barely visible, standing unnaturally still.

Gene walked away with a grimace. ""Fuckin weirdos in this city.""

The radio crackled again ""Tonight's story takes place in a little cafe' in the middle of nowhere. It's the tale of a man that worked there tirelessly. Wasn't his dream job – hell no - but we all got to make bread in this cold harsh world, right listeners?""

Gene's ears perked. He turned toward the radio, eyes narrowing.

""It was his closing shift of the night, and he was not too happy about it, he felt dread working at that place. Damp and shabby, you know that kind of place, where dead ends hang around, sipping coffee that they can't afford. junkies. Heck, even ghosts probably.""

A cold finger ran down Gene's spine. He stepped closer to the counter, listening.

""The man was finishing up the usual chores. Sweeping floors, locking doors. Thinking he was safe inside. But you all know, danger knocks at no door. Not in this city. And that night? Out of all of us, That man was in the most danger."" Gene stepped back feeling unease at those words.

""The man was going back to his locker to change from his uniform and pick his belongings. And then – he heard it. A chime. Soft. Close. Familiar.""

Gene shook his head listening to the story. And yet he could not hide the uncanny feeling that was lurking in him. He reached again, turning the dial to change frequency. Twisting and turning, there was only static, occasionally interrupted by the radio voice.

""--Not much time left now friends. Tick, tock.""

""Fuck this piece of junk."" Gene turned off the radio and went back to work. The silence that followed was almost worse. He went to the staff area in the back and reached for his locker. He changed his clothes, stuffed his wallet and house keys into his pockets.

A chime rang.

Gene turned, scanning the main hall of the cafe', cold sweat coating his forehead. Taking a deep breath, he let out a nervous laugh. ""It's just a scary story on the radio."" said to calm himself, unable to not notice the coincidences from the radio host.

He walked back to the hall. Cold air coming from the ajar front door. He approached the door handle to get out of there and call it a night but when he tried to take the first step outside, he could not bring himself to. An unnatural, visceral fear grasped his mind as he gazed at the darkness outside, not even pierced by the sickly yellow lights of the cafe'.

It was a choice no man could face.

The horrors outside, or the dangers within?

Gene stepped back inside, locking the door behind him, the chimes tingling above. In the following silence he sighed, senses heightened.

He heard it again. The ticking of the clock.

Twelve.

He kept looking, the seconds ticking by completing full circle.

Twelve.

Another minute went by.

Twelve.

""What the fuck."" he muttered to himself as he walked away from the door towards the counter, his heels screeching on the linoleum.

The radio, he needed to turn on the radio. Switching it on again the husky voice came back.

"" --ed back on the radio, thinking that it could give him the answers to the many riddles happening to him. Why did the door open? How come the clock wasn't striking any other time? What was the darkness outside? We may get to those later listeners, no spoilers.""

Gene clutched the radio between his hands like it could somehow protect him. Answer to the impossibilities happening around him.

""Now now"" the voice crooned ""No need to panic listeners. It's just a story remember? A spooky story for sleepless nights. Strange nights. Wrong Nights.""

The lights above flickered.

""Just tell me what the fuck is going on!"" Hands shaking, Gene pulled the radio as it was speaking directly to the broadcaster. After a hiss the show continued.

""The man held the radio as if it was his lifeline"" a hint of amusement behind the words. ""but alas, even lifelines fray, don't they listeners?"" the broadcaster snickered.

In a fit of rage, Gene ripped the radio from the power outlet, raised it above his head, and then smashed it to the ground. ""Fuck you!"" He yelled, as the old radio shattered to pieces of circuitry and wood chips.

The voice stopped abruptly, and silence fell once more.

Gene's breath was heavy and uneven, looking down at the broken machine, staring at the speaker with an enraged frown.

The Clock struck twelve once more.

Gene sat down, elbows on the counter, hands covering his face.

""Now Now, Gene..."" deep, husky, threatening, the voice came from the speaker. ""...I was telling a story to our listeners, that was not very nice of you. We were just getting to the finale.""

Gene stared at the fragments, then rose stiffly. Hand to the wall, steadying himself, as if it could anchor him to reality.

""He thought he was safe inside,"" The broadcast continued between broken hisses of static. ""But doors, dear listeners... they don't really keep things out. Not when they are already inside.""

The chimes above the front door jingled once more.

Gene's head whipped toward the entrance. It was still closed. He walked slowly towards it. His hand was beaded in cold sweats as he approached the handle and with a trembling pull, he tried to open it. Still locked. He sighed in relief. Chimes rang once more and this time - it came from behind him.

""The man felt safe in the relative comfort of the illuminated cafe"" The voice said with a soft chuckle. ""And yet, he forgot - bright lights cast the darkest shadows. Let's dim down the lights now, listeners. The show is almost to an end.""

Gene turned. There it stood under the flickering lights - a dark cloaked figure of impossibly long limbs, towering over him. It's face, if it even had one, was nothing but a smear, an imitation of human forms. And as the lights flickered it moved, slowly, inexorably.

Gene scrambled through his pockets keys jingling between his trembling hands.

The ring felt impossibly heavy between is fingers - as if an invisible force was trying to snatch it away from him.

He scratched the keyhole with unsteady marks.

One key. No.

Two keys. No.

A third -- And then he felt it behind him.

Breathless. Silent. Waiting.

Gene muttered prayers as the being lowered his uneven hand on his shoulder, slowly turning him - as if to savor the moment.

A muffled scream followed, swallowed by the darkness of a moonless night.

""Finality"" the voice drawled, ""Is something we all fear, listeners. But when it comes – by choice or otherwise – no power in this world can stop it.""

The clock struck twelve.

I had the idea to make a “Coffee and Cars” in Forza Horizon to try and build a community of car enthusiasts, and just people who want to have fun car meets/Drives. I haven’t really seen a LFG for Forza like this, and always see people looking for others! 

Current ideas are as follows and please give me more ideas!

-Discord for people to find groups for meets and drives, and easily share photos from said meets/drives.

-A weekly/monthly meet up that is themed, car type, manufacturer, livery, etc. 

It’s a rough open right now but I think it has potential to be a fun thing to do and build a good community of like minded people. Again PLEASE give me feedback and thoughts!

I was trying to make new friends. I recently got out of a casual relationship with an avoidant and im not  emotionally strong. I have feelings and wanted more and he didnt. And he lied to me often. 

I went to a coffee place recently to meet 4 women, like me, single and in their 50s.

All 4 have multiple FWB, men just for sex, men they have dates with and one they really care for. They dont want a relationship though. 

I didnt judge as to each their own.

I said I wanted a relationship but at the very least one exclusive partner would work.

They were laughing saying how I was behind the times, I'd be alone forever. Men are not like that anymore, etc. I didnt hear from them and was told by one that I didnt fit with the group.  That's fine.

They said I was missing out on my sexuality and living.

Im feeling a bit embarrassed.  How did you accept your monogamous and be ok with it?  The thought of having multiple partners isn't for me at all. I have no interest in even trying. Id rather travel alone than sleep with multiple people.

Am I missing out though? Will I always be alone?",8,1746714861.0,monogamy,9,1.0,False

1khrmex,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1khrmex/cinque_terre_tuscany_april_trip_report/,Cinque Terre & Tuscany (April) trip report,"Wanted to share back a couple of tips/tricks & lessons learnt from our recent trip to give back....

We flew in/out of Milan, train to Cinque Terre (3 days), then train to Pisa. Then hired a car in Pisa (7/8 days) and did a clockwise loop back to Pisa (roughly: Lucca, Barga, Florence, Sienna, south, etc)

**Train (Milan Airport/MXP Express) timings**

\- I wish I knew in advance: (At least this is true if travelling within the EU I believe - we flew from Iceland) - there was essentially no customs/border entry at MXP. This meant we went from baggage carousel to public terminal in a few steps and zero delays. Why does this matter?  
We wanted to book a train from Milan to Cinque Terre in advance. Since we didn't know the timings of flights/customs we didn't book in advance. Had I known this now, I would have booked a ticket in advance (knowing we could easily make it within say 2 hours from MXP to Milano Centrale). I was unable to find this info online beforehand. Used this for trains: [https://www.seat61.com/train-travel-in-italy.htm](https://www.seat61.com/train-travel-in-italy.htm)

Also, when taking the MXP express return from Milan Centrale-MXP, you cannot enter back into the station without a ticket. You have to go down a level to buy a ticket (from machines or one of 3 agencies). We missed our airport train as a result :-(

**Pisa Airport** (PISAMover & Car Hire)  
  
\- Hired a car from Pisa airport. Didn't see a ton of signage (if coming from PisaMover station), head slightly left (to road) as you approach the airport terminal entrance on right. All car hire/s lot is a few hundred meters away (further ahead). There is a shuttle bus - but I would just walk it. It's about a 5 min walk. Follow (red?) markings on ground through the carpark and then alongside the public road (on your left) and it will be on your right. For a family in future I'd just get a taxi and get dropped at car hire directly. (see below).  
\- PISAMover. Would not use again (applies to a family)  
If you're happy with the price, then simply buy a ticket at the gate, enter and ride. But be aware:  
\- You cannot buy a family ticket from the machine. If you try to fix that by buying a family ticket online, you willl later realise it's one-way from PSA airport - Pisa Centrale & it's now useless. There are no staff. Anywhere. Not on the train (it's unmanned), or at the station at either end. You have to call them - then they say they will send someone to assist. No-one arrives. Even when I then later tried to use my paid ticket to return from the airport - it wouldn't scan. Again, no-one to assist. What a nightmare - still trying to get my refund back from them via email (even that takes 1-2 weeks to get a response).

**Cinque Terre:**

\- Was suprised to be offered an option to pay cash for 10% discount (no, we didn't stay anywhere dodgy) - this was a great saving (3 nights)  
\- Had seen comments about lack of ATM's in Cinque Terre (well, specifically ATM's that wouldn't charge additional fees). This wasn't an issue. Credit Agricole was the most prevalent (in pretty much every town) & I paid no additional withdrawl fees. But, they can be out of cash at times too.  
\- Purchased our Treno MS card from our accomodation. It was roughly 30% cheaper than the advertised prices on the website (I didn't ask any questions).  
\- Treno MS card/passes come with free wi-fi codes for wi-fi access at all (local) stations! Unexpected bonus.  
\- It was MUCH busier than I had expected. Considering the 'off-peak' season (and not Easter) I wasn't expecting those crowds. Vernazza seemed to be one of the most heavily trafficked.  
\- Trains were not as frequent as expected, and were usually running late. I saw the schedule, but generally we were told trains run 'very regularly'. Not really the case, and often 5-20 min late. I'd advised having the schedule handy unless you want to be waiting on the platform instead of sigh-seeing.  
[https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/cinque-terre-timetable](https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/cinque-terre-timetable)  
\- FWIW, only got randomly asked to show passes once (train) and once (bus) in 3 days.  
\- Bear in mind the pass also covers the bus. We only used it once (looking at you Corniglia: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/eJsknJtCeMuoR95q7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eJsknJtCeMuoR95q7) and it was a great solution for tired legs to quickly get to the train. Often saw these little buses running empty and wished we'd used them a little more often.   
\- If planning to stay in Manarola or Riomaggiore, and you intend to do the paid Via dell'Amore, be aware that you can ask your accomodation for like a 'residents pass' which lowers the cost from €10 to €8 and allows you to access the path in both directions, and 'after hours' and for the duration of your stay (not one day). Granted, I'm taking this off face value as we got the resident doc, but ran out of time to do the walk. [https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/cinque-terre-via-dell-amore](https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/cinque-terre-via-dell-amore)   
\- Saw lots of expensive boat options to get a sea view. Did this cheaper option instead: [https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/boat-excursions](https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/boat-excursions) . Tickets cannot sell out, so you can buy on the day. Can be hard to spot the 'sales agent' when the dock is packed (ask the boat crew or look near the boat for a little fold-up table and a person with brochures). We were going to do the 'after 2 Pm' option, but it actually worked out better/cheaper to just buy one specific leg. We did Monterroso-La Spezia. This was 'Line 2'. [https://www.navigazionegolfodeipoeti.it/en/cinque-terre](https://www.navigazionegolfodeipoeti.it/en/cinque-terre) I think this was €30 one way and stops in Porto Venere (which was a bonus to have an hour there to briefly explore). Be aware that the docking in La Spezia is almost 30 min from the train station by foot! (where your pass will let you get a train back to Cinque Terre). Also be aware that some ports can be closed. Again, luckily I asked our accomodation in the morning & they immediatly let us know our port (Manarola) was closed for the day. So we changed plans accordingly. Else suggest to keep an eye on their website.  
\- If self-catering, would suggest buying groceries in advance (where possible). At least the smaller towns only have 1-2 very small stores. Fine for milk/vegetables/pasta - but you will struggle with other items (eg) Yoghurt or perhaps some other dinner staples. That said, a great experience we had in Corniglia was going into their tiny grocery store and picking out ingredients to take back and cook. We were served 1:1 at the store and had a great pasta meal.  
\- Photography/staying in one of the 5 towns.  
Even early in the mornings, didn't get alot of 'alone' time (for photos without others). Even from say 6:45 Am the streets already had construction workers, police, deliver people/trucks, etc. No real tourists - but still plenty of other obstructions. I get it - people live there, they need to carry on with their lives. Only adding to set expectations if anyone is specifically staying in a village for this reason.  
\- Gelato/Ice-cream: Tip: When selecting multi flavours, select the one you want most first (it's the bigger/biggest scoop)  
Alberto Gelateria (Corniglia) - probably in the top 3-4 gelatos we had in Italy. Very friendly/patient server & I think they did tasters.  
Gelateria Vernazza (Vernazza) - very good (generous portions)  


**Other/random**

\-Driving. Saw comments about getting the smallest car possible. I didn't find that true. Granted, you don't want a bus - but most times a 'regular size car' didn't cause us any undue pain. It's not (typically) like you need to squeeze into a tiny parking spot in a ZTL. Italy in general doesn't appear to agree with modern cars driver aids/warnings. Your rental car is going to make alot of beeping  ;-)  
\- Drivers are impatient, but not aggressive as such - was manageble.  
\- Got an International Drivers License - but was never stopped by police or asked to show it. Only asked to show our passports once on an inter-city train.  
\- Speed limits (in Tuscany) on rural roads were crazy slow (eg) 50/60Km. It's no wonder the locals ignore them. We didn't -for fear of speeding fines, but typically there are designated (marked) speed trapping zones and you get plenty of advance warning. Unless you aren't paying attention.  
\-Smoking. Each to their own, but as a non-smoker (from a country where smoking is uncommon and in decline for many years) - this was an (unpleasant) suprise. Welcome to the 80's - LOL.   
\- Didn't need cash anywhere, except for one parking place (where the NFC card reader was broken, and the traditional card reader).  
\- Supermarket. We used Esselunga wherever possible - they were amazing. Massive stores, good prices and willing to assist you (generally found an English speaker or they would call someone). Great range & their own-brand seemed good quality (cookies/yoghurt/water, etc) Self-checkouts (including Italy) usually just have an English button so hit that. I don't think it did fruit/veg - so you might want to make note of the Italian word for what you selected - so you can search it up at checkout.  
\- Toilets are paid almost everywhere. We just found it best to spend that money on a drink/coffee & then ask to use their bathroom. At least that way you got something for you spend.

Ever thought about how to kick your retirement up a notch? 🌟 I mean, we’ve worked so hard to get here – why not **live our best lives** in this next chapter, right? I’ve been diving into some daily habits that can seriously amp up our vibrancy and vitality during retirement. So grab a comfy seat, maybe a cup of coffee, and let’s chat!

Here are a few daily habits that have been game-changers for many:

1. **Move a Little Every Day!**  
   I know what you might be thinking: “A workout? Really?” But hear me out! Movement doesn’t have to mean running marathons or lifting heavy weights. Take a stroll around the neighborhood, try some gentle yoga, or even dance to your favorite tunes! Remember, it’s all about enjoying the process. 

2. **Stay Connected**  
   We all know that friends are the spice of life! Not only do they add joy, but staying social can also keep our minds sharp. Grab brunch with old pals, join a book club, or take a fun class together. *Who would’ve thought networking could be this fun in retirement?*

3. **Nurture Your Mind**  
   Ever pick up a new hobby? Learning something new keeps those brain cells working! Whether it’s painting, playing an instrument, or picking up a new language. Challenge yourself! You might just find a hidden talent. 

4. **Set Realistic Goals**  
   I mean, we’re already set up for success, right? *Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.* Seriously, just breaking down your big dreams into smaller, achievable goals can work wonders. Visit this link for some practical steps that could help: [Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.](https://mavely.app.link/e/qBribQrKcTb)

5. **Gratitude Checks**  
   Simple yet powerful! Take a minute every day to jot down what you’re grateful for. It shifts your perspective from what’s lacking to celebrating what you have. Plus, who doesn’t want to feel good?

6. **Rejuvenate Your Spirit**  
   Don’t forget the joy! Whether it’s gardening, meditation, or simply soaking in a beautiful sunset, carving out time for things that bring you joy can uplift your entire day. *Isn’t life too short to not enjoy every moment?*

Remember, retirement is not just an end; it’s a **new beginning!** Let’s embrace these years with all the enthusiasm we can muster.

* **Creatine + Tyrosine** (3–5 g + 500–2 000 mg) → energy buffer + catecholamine precursor; helps cognition when sleep-deprived or stressed.

# 1. Theanine + Caffeine

Green-tea wisdom meets lab data: a 2025 meta-analysis of 50 RCTs shows the pair reliably quickens choice-reaction time while keeping anxiety and heart-rate spikes in check. Theanine (\~100 mg) raises alpha-wave activity, countering caffeine jitters. Popular 2 : 1 ratio (200 mg theanine : 100 mg caffeine) scales well down to 100 mg : 50 mg for light users. [Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nutrit/nuaf054/8123998?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8794723/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Suggested use:** single AM dose or split AM/early-PM. Avoid after 3 p.m. if sensitive to caffeine.

# 2. Citicoline (CDP-Choline) + DHA

Citicoline supplies cytidine and choline for synthesizing phosphatidylcholine, while DHA enriches the same membrane lipids; together they improve neuronal fluidity and acetylcholine output. A 2024 RCT in post-ischemic adults found the combo outperformed either alone on verbal memory and delayed recall. Daily 250–500 mg citicoline with 500–1 000 mg DHA (usually fish-oil) is typical. [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11201817/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11222871/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Tip:** take with a fat-containing meal to boost DHA absorption.

# 3. Rhodiola rosea + Caffeine

Rhodiola (3 % rosavins, 1 % salidroside) tempers over-arousal and may prolong catecholamine signalling; paired with \~100 mg caffeine it preserved reaction time and jump power during repeated-sprint protocols in two 2023 trials. Users report less crash than caffeine alone. Dose 200–400 mg Rhodiola \~30 min pre-task alongside your usual coffee/espresso.

# 4. Bacopa monnieri + Ashwagandha (Withania)

Bacopa excels at long-term memory consolidation (needs 6–8 weeks); Ashwagandha moderates HPA-axis stress signalling. A 2023 double-blind formulation study showed combined 300 mg bacopa + 300 mg ashwagandha cut STAI-anxiety scores and improved delayed-word recall vs placebo after 8 weeks. Ideal for chronic “brain-fog + stress” profiles.

# 5. Creatine + L-Tyrosine

Creatine buffers brain phosphocreatine, sustaining ATP during sleep-loss or intense study; a 2024 sleep-deprivation RCT (0.35 g/kg) improved processing speed. Tyrosine (dopamine/noradrenaline precursor) restores catecholamines depleted by cognitive or thermal stress. A 2024 crossover trial combining the two found lower salivary cortisol and faster n-back accuracy. Practical stack: 3–5 g creatine monohydrate with 500–2 000 mg tyrosine 60 min pre-demand.

# 6. Lion’s Mane + Omega-3 (DHA)

Lion’s Mane erinacines boost NGF; DHA up-regulates BDNF—two complementary neurotrophins. While no formal RCT has tested them together, separate human data show Lion’s Mane (1 g extract) can speed Stroop performance and lower subjective stress, and DHA consistently raises circulating BDNF. Many bio-hackers cap both at breakfast for long-range brain health. [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10675414/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Quick-Reference Dosing Table

Routine:

Fasting:

	•	16-hour fasting for at least 45 days
	•	20-hour fasting for 7 days
	•	Lost 15 pounds during this period( prolonged fasting needs doctors advice to balance salt and others)

Meal Timing:

	•	Lunch around 2 PM
	•	Dinner before 7 PM, 95% of the time

Food:

	•	2 eggs and lean meat (chicken or salmon) at least 4 days a week
	•	Salad at least twice a week (Costco Mediterranean salad pack, without the sweet dressing)
	•	Cheese once a week
	•	Broccoli, kale, other veggies, nuts (almonds, cashews, pistachios), and sunflower seeds were part of almost every meal
	•	Avocados at least 4 times a week
	•	Had sugary food only twice during this period — reduced sugar intake by 99%
	•	Reduced rice consumption from 100% to just 5%
	•	Completely stopped drinking coffee and milk. I used to drink coffee at least 4 times a day, but it disrupted my sleep while fasting, so I gave it up.

Exercise:

	•	Couldn’t make time for regular exercise due to my work schedule

Sleep:

	•	Irregular sleep pattern, but I averaged about 6 hours per night

Health Consideration:

	•	I have high blood pressure, so I consulted my doctor before starting my fasting and diet plan. He guided me throughout the process.
	•	I used a Stello CGM to monitor my carb intake, which was very helpful.
	•	Please consult your doctor and develop a plan before starting any fasting or dietary changes.

1khr8w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nootropicstacks/comments/1khr8w2/6weeks_with_thinkease_the_smartest_stack_ive/,6-Weeks with ThinkEase - the smartest stack I’ve tried so far,"Hey folks,

I’m a serial tester of noots (caffeine/theanine veteran, tried everything from basic choline to racetams). ThinkEase landed in my mailbox six weeks ago, and I’ve been logging daily stats in Notion plus a few simple cognitive-speed tests (Stroop, reaction-time web apps). Here’s the full download.

# TL;DR

* **Focus:** noticeable Day 1, stable ever since
* **Memory retrieval:** kicked in during Week 2 and kept compounding
* **Mental stamina / clarity:** fewer “brain-buffering” moments, especially post-lunch
* **Side-effects:** zero for me (partner felt mild nausea at 4-cap dose, fine at two)
* **Value:** priced like other premium stacks, but the 4-caps serving means *much* higher actives per £

# 1️⃣ Why I bit the bullet

Most “all-in-one” formulas either hide dosages in proprietary blends or cram 15 ingredients into two miniature caps. ThinkEase shows the exact milligrams *and* uses four capsules per serving, so every ingredient is at (or close to) the amounts you actually see in the literature. That was enough to make me trade in my DIY pill-tower for a month.

# 2️⃣ Ingredient architecture — what’s doing what?

|Focus & Alertness|Memory Matrix / Neurogenesis|Brain Flow / Clarity|Cell-Level Support|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Acetyl L-Carnitine** 750 mg – acetyl donor + mito fuel|**Bacopa** 300 mg (55 % bacosides)|**Ginkgo** 120 mg|**Phosphatidylserine** 100 mg|
|**N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine** 275 mg – catecholamine precursor|**Citicoline** 250 mg|**Pine Bark** 75 mg|**B-Complex** (B6 2.5 mg, B9 100 µg, B12 7.5 µg)|
|**Rhodiola** 200 mg|**Spanish Sage** 25 mg|**Korean Ginseng** 100 mg||
|**L-Theanine** 200 mg|**Lion’s Mane 550 mg** – stimulates NGF & BDNF → long-term memory & nerve repair|||

*(All per 4-caps serving; caffeine-free)*

# 3️⃣ What I actually felt

# Week 0 baseline

Average Stroop completion: **39.4 s**  
Afternoon slump rating: **7/10** foggiest being 10  
Email-inbox “time to zero”: **54 min**

# Day 1–3

* Smooth, coffee-like lift without jitters about 45 min after breakfast dose.
* First real “wow” moment: knocked out a 90-slide deck in one sitting, no Twitter detours.

# Week 2

* **Recall uptick:** in meetings I could quote figures from last quarter without fishing through notes.
* Stroop improved to **36.1 s** (+8.4 %). I know these micro-tests aren’t gospel, but the trend was obvious.

# Week 4

* Afternoon fog rating down to **3/10**. I still crave a tea at 3 p.m. but the mental dip is shallow.
* Inbox-zero time: **38 min** (-30 %).
* Brain-hang at 11 p.m. gone; I’m reading dense papers again before bed.

# Week 6 (today)

Numbers have plateaued but benefits feel “locked in.” I can skip a day without crash, but I miss the extra gear.

# 4️⃣ Why I think it works (n = 1 theory)

* **Fast responders:** L-Tyrosine + Rhodiola blunt stress-related dopamine dips, so focus shows up Day 1.
* **Slow burners:** Bacopa & Citicoline need chronic dosing; memory gains started \~Day 10 as expected.
* **Flow ingredients:** Ginkgo + Pine Bark = better cerebral blood flow → smoother mental switching.
* **Stimulant-free design:** zero caffeine means I can layer my usual 100 mg coffee without risking the shakes.

# 5️⃣ Any downsides?

* **Four caps** might be annoying if you hate swallowing pills.
* **Price point** (£59) stings if you’re used to bargain multis, but on a per-mg basis it’s actually cheaper than building the stack yourself from 8 separate bottles.
* **Nausea possibility:** partner felt queasy when taking all four on an empty stomach—food fixed it.

# 6️⃣ Verdict

ThinkEase is the first premade stack that’s *equal or better* than my custom regimen—and a lot less fiddly. Focus boost was immediate, memory & clarity followed with compounding returns, and I haven’t noticed any tolerance creep. I’m re-upping for another two months and might even retire my choline/Bacopa jars entirely.

The Lunch

George, Adam, Rich, and Joe took lunch together every day at their Central Jersey life insurance office. It broke up the grind — the endless calls trying to convince people whether whole or term life would better protect their families.

All four were settled into their own predictable stories. Adam and Rich had wives and kids. George and Joe were married too, but no kids — just mortgages, credit card debt, and that quiet itch for something else. They talked sports, gambling, movies, the “work hot” girls in the office, and placed bets on whether Jameson the office womanizer was actually sleeping with them.

It wasn’t much. But it broke up the routine.

Today, though, George’s offhand comment promised to shatter that routine completely. It started innocently enough — just an observation over turkey clubs and too-sweet iced teas.

“I was driving Nancy to the doctor’s Saturday,” George said. “Passed the Freehold check-cashing place again. Every Saturday, 7 a.m. sharp, armored car’s there, unloading sacks of cash. Gotta be four million in that truck easy. And Main Street’s dead at that hour. Guards? One looks about sixty, frail as hell. Guy couldn’t wrestle a kitten. And I started thinking… four of us? We get the drop on ‘em? We’re millionaires before breakfast.”

Rich leaned back, whistled low. “Million bucks each? Hell, that’d pay for my kids’ college and then some.”

Adam, the creative one — film degree gathering dust in his basement — grinned. “We’d need a plan. A foolproof one. Force the driver to some abandoned spot where we got an SUV stashed. Tie ‘em up, load the cash, drive off clean. Joe could be the wheelman. Hah.”

George laughed. “Yeah — too bad we don’t exactly have an arsenal. Can’t knock over an armored truck with harsh language.”

Rich shrugged, dead serious. “I could get us guns. My brother knows a guy — Larry, old friend from high school. Said if we ever needed heat, Larry’s the hookup.”

Joe nearly choked on his soda. “Jesus, you guys are nuts. We wouldn’t have the balls to shoplift gum at Wawa, and you’re talking about hijacking an armored car.”

George grinned. “Relax. I’m not saying we do it. But what if we just check it out Saturday? Stake it out. You’ll see what I mean. Call it a field trip. Something different.”

Adam’s eyes had that familiar mischievous twinkle. “Like research. For a movie. Yeah… could be fun. And we hit a diner after, plot out our imaginary heist.”

“I’m in,” George said, tapping his sandwich crust on the table like a gavel. “Let’s do it.”

Rich smirked. “I’ll pick you guys up at six-thirty. Gives us time to scope the place. Just for fun.”

Joe shifted uncomfortably, already regretting his friendship. “Lunch break’s over, boys. Back to reality. I got calls to make. But, uh… I’m always in for diner pancakes.”

The Diner

That Saturday morning, Rich picked up the boys as planned. It was 6:30 a.m., about thirty minutes before the armored car was scheduled to pull up next to the check-cashing place. He pulled into the strip mall and parked in front of a pool supply store, with a clear line of sight to their target.

Right on cue, the armored car arrived. The driver and guard got out and headed to the back, unlocking the doors and hauling out two heavy sacks of cash each. The check-cashing manager let them in without a glance. It was their first stop of the day.

The boys in the car watched in silence, taking it all in. No one spoke.

The guards came back out, climbed into the truck, and drove off. It looked less like a big-time security outfit and more like a mom-and-pop operation — the kind that handled small, sketchy cash joints, not major banks.

Still, no one in the car said a word. Finally, Rich broke the silence.

“Let’s go eat,” he said, starting the engine and pulling out.

They drove to the diner and grabbed a booth in the back, away from prying eyes. The waitress poured them coffee and took their orders.

George looked around at the table, sizing them all up. “So, what do you think?” he said.

Adam, still studying the menu, didn’t look up. “It’s definitely doable. You see those bushes right next to where they unload? We get dropped there early, lay low, and as soon as they step out—bam—we ambush ’em.”

“Yeah,” George said, nodding. “They wouldn’t know what hit ’em.”

“Right. I sit up front with the driver, and you two get in the back with the money and Grandpa,” Rich added, grinning.

“And that’s it—we force the driver to take us to where Joe’s waiting. We tie them up, transfer the money to the rental SUV, and drive off. Scott free. A million each,” said Adam, his eyes gleaming.

Rich leaned in. “I already talked to Larry. He can get us the twelve-gauge and a couple of nines by Wednesday. Next week at this time, it’s done.”

Joe still hadn’t said a word. A cool million—just like that—was tempting as hell. But this? This was nuts.

“If you guys are serious,” Joe finally said, voice tight, “count me out. This is insane.”

Rich shrugged. “Fine. I’ll get my brother to drive. He could use a million if you can’t.”

Joe held up a hand. “Look, I’m just the driver. No guns for me. I drop you off, wait at the spot, and then we go home. That’s it.”

George leaned forward. “Yeah, that’s it. I was thinking the woods behind the old Crowley barn. Off the backroads—twenty minutes tops.”

Adam looked around the table. “Okay. So we’re all in?”

Rich smiled, wide and cold. “Yeah. No backing out now. Next week, we’re all millionaires.”

The Job

That Wednesday, Rich picked up the guns from Larry in Staten Island. He laid out the cash and figured he’d reimburse himself later, once they were flush with loot.

At work, they were quieter that week. No one mentioned the job. They all knew their roles. No need to say it out loud.

Saturday morning came. Joe wrangled them all into the rental SUV. They told their wives they were heading out for a day at the driving range.

Rich sat up front with Joe, handing George and Adam each a 9mm. He tucked another into the glove box.
“It’s here if you need it,” he said.

Joe glanced at him, face blank, then turned back to the road.

At 6:30 a.m., Joe dropped them off by the bushes and drove off toward the rendezvous spot.

The three of them crouched low, hearts pounding, waiting for their millions to arrive. The fall morning was still dark, damp. They wore black hoodies, hoods up, stockings over their faces. Too jacked on adrenaline to feel fear now.

At 7:00 sharp, the armored car rumbled into the lot.

Rich checked them. “Everybody good? This is it. Show time.”

George and Adam nodded. Time to move.

As soon as the guards stepped out, the boys sprang from the bushes.

George jammed his 9mm against the driver’s temple. “Back in the seat. Quiet.”

Rich swung around front with the shotgun. “You—get in the back,” he barked at the older guard. “Move!”

George and Adam climbed in after him.
“Hands behind your back!” Adam snapped.

But the old man twitched. Went for his gun.

George fired before he even realized he was doing it. The shot boomed, the guard crumpled.

Up front, the driver screamed, “MIKE!”

Rich cracked him across the face with the butt of the shotgun. “Shut up! Drive!”

In the back, Adam’s face went pale as he checked the body. “He’s dead.”

George’s voice wobbled. “He went for his gun, you saw. I had to shoot. Self-defense. Had to…”

Rich shoved the shotgun barrel under the driver’s chin. “One wrong move and I blow your head off.”

The driver, shaking, stared dead ahead and drove.

Rich slid the small window open. “What the hell happened?”

George’s voice was flat. “Told him to put his hands back. He went for his piece. I had to shoot.”

Rich grunted. “We’re almost there. Backroads, no traffic. Stay cool.”

Minutes later, they pulled behind the abandoned barn, near the woods. Joe was parked out of sight, plates covered.

Rich yanked the driver out. “On your knees. Head down.”

The driver dropped, babbling, begging them to let him go. Swearing he’d stay quiet.

The crew huddled, voices low and urgent. Everything had gone sideways.

George finally nodded. “Tell him we’ll let him go.”

Rich turned. “Get up.”

The driver stood, trembling, eyes fixed on the ground.

Without warning, Rich pressed the 9mm behind his ear and fired. The man dropped like a puppet with its strings cut.

“We had to,” Rich muttered. “No chances.”

George stared at the body. “Stupid old man. He caused this.”

Joe pulled the SUV up and caught sight of the scene.
His face went white. “Oh my God. What the hell happened?”

George barely looked at him. “Told the old man to put his hands up. He went for his gun. I had to shoot.”

Adam snapped, “No time for this. Move the money. What’s done is done.”

Joe’s voice cracked. “No way. I didn’t sign up for this! Nobody was supposed to get hurt! I’m out!”

The wind kicked up, rustling the trees.

Rich rounded on him, voice hard. “This isn’t a bowling team, Joe. You can’t just quit. We’re all in now. A hundred percent.”

They moved fast, hauling the heavy money bags into the SUV. There had to be at least four million, just like they’d hoped.

Joe drove them south to Rich’s place in Toms River. His wife was away in Atlantic City with her sister. Perfect timing.

They backed the SUV into the garage, just enough to hide the plates, and unloaded the cash. They covered the bags with canvas tarps, the garage door rattling shut behind them.

Standing there, breathing hard, they made the pact: they’d meet Monday at lunch. Lay low. Wind down.

Surprisingly, they were all calm. Stoic, even.

In the end, they got the money. Covered their tracks. No loose ends.

Mission accomplished.

The weekend passed, and the news kept reporting no new leads in the armored car robbery and double murder. The boys showed up at work Monday in surprisingly good spirits. Joe, at least, was just relieved it was behind them. They’d agreed to let some time pass before spending the money, but they knew it was safe — stacked in bags under canvas in Rich’s garage.

Still, it was hard to imagine going back to selling insurance after the adrenaline jolt of the weekend. Something inside them, at least in most of them, was already craving more.

At lunch, they slipped into their usual table like nothing had changed. But everything had.

“I am so amped up after last week,” Rich said, grinning wide. “Never felt a high like that in my life. We should try a bank next — now that we’ve proven ourselves.”

Adam leaned in, voice low. “Yeah, a lot less planning needed. We walk in, hand the tellers notes to fill up our bags, and we’re out. Happens more than you know.”

George forced a laugh, his hands jittery around his coffee cup. “I’m in. This can be our Saturday hobby.”

Joe stared down at his plate. He seemed to be the only one haunted by the fact they’d murdered two innocent men in cold blood. His voice was flat when he finally spoke. “I’m done. Not pushing my luck. We’re lucky we got away with it.”

Rich turned to him, his grin sharpening. “Look, you’re not built for this — I get it. Maybe you got more of a conscience. Maybe you’re a better person than me. But one more job, Joe. That’s all I ask. One more jolt.”

The others nodded, sealing the deal without much more thought. One more job. Rich’s bank. This weekend. Get it out of their system — and then they’d never bring it up again.

Adam leaned back and scratched his chin. “We should carjack a getaway vehicle the day before. Can’t use our own rides.”

Rich waved him off. “Leave that to me. I’ll pick everyone up like last week. And this one—” he smiled, too wide, “this one’s gonna go smooth. Can’t go any worse.”

The Final Job

The week flew by in a rush of anticipation. Saturday loomed — their final job.
Rich boosted a Toyota Camry from a woman in Jackson. Told her she’d get it back in a couple days. She wouldn’t.
They never did a real walk-through, but Rich had gone over it with them so many times it felt automatic.

Joe waited out front. Again, he refused a gun. But Rich, not trusting fate, stuffed a 9mm in the glove compartment just in case.

George and Adam’s job: cover the two security guards.
Rich’s job: get the tellers to fill the bags.
Simple. No armored car drivers to kidnap this time. Clean. Easy.

Rich picked everyone up early, and Joe took over driving them to the bank. Afterward, they’d ditch the Camry a couple blocks away and switch to the rental car waiting nearby.

Excitement built in the car, but so did the tension.
They all knew: no matter how well you plan, things go sideways.

The Camry pulled up in front of the bank.
They yanked the stockings down over their faces, hoodies up.
Rich said, “Game time,” and they marched in like they’d rehearsed it.

Inside, George and Adam pressed their pistols against the backs of the two security guards.
“Don’t move,” they said low and calm.

Rich moved to the teller booths, slamming a bag on the counter.
“Fill it up. Fast. Don’t think—just move.”

Then Rich caught something in his peripheral vision.
One of the guards — the one Adam was covering — was lowering his hand.
Adrenaline roaring in his veins, Rich fired without thinking.

The guard dropped, hit in the leg.
Rich bared his teeth and yelled at the tellers.
“Fill the bag! You’re next if you don’t move!”

Then — chaos.

Joe burst through the doors, 9mm in hand, panic in his face.
He fixed the gun on George.
“This ends now! Drop the guns — we’re walking out of here!”

Adam swung his pistol up, jamming it behind Joe’s head.
“Drop it! You lost your damn mind? Drop it or you’re dead!”

Rich, still at the counter, couldn’t believe what he was seeing.
Jacked up, heart pounding, he fired at Joe.

Joe’s gun went off as he staggered, the shot catching George in the chest.

Distracted, Adam didn’t see the wounded guard on the floor raise his weapon and shoot him in the side.
Adam collapsed.

Rich spun and shot the downed guard, but as he turned, the second security guard — the one George had been covering — squeezed his trigger and dropped Rich where he stood.

In seconds, all four lay dead on the cold floor.
Their final job ending in a bloodbath.

The surviving guard stood there, stunned, looking over the wreckage.
He shook his head, muttering under his breath:
“Four idiots with a death wish.”

It’s wild to think just a decade ago, the idea of planning for retirement was all about boring spreadsheets and elder care, and now it feels like Gen Z and Millennials are making it *cool* to talk money online. Enter our beloved Reddit and Facebook Groups—a haven for quirky memes, wisdom bombs, and straight-up brutal honesty. You can practically hear the “Ok, boomer” echoes. 😂

So, how are these awesome groups shaping the future of retirement planning? Let’s break it down:

- **Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.** 💪 
  This mantra isn’t just for the workplace; it’s a lifestyle. Millennials and Gen Z are all about clarity and achievable milestones, making financial advice feel less like a chore and more like a game plan. They want actionable steps—who knew retirement could be gamified?

- **Sharing vulnerabilities is the new flex.**  
  Gone are the days when “money talk” was a taboo subject. In these online communities, individuals are laying their financial worries bare, asking for help, and sharing their journeys. You’ve got posts like, ""I just realized my student debt is a black hole—any tips?"" sparking discussions filled with advice, compassion, and the best pep talks!

- **Diverse strategies for a diverse world.** 🌍
  Whether it’s investing in sustainable companies or crowdfunding retirement plans, younger generations are pushing the envelope. They’re not just interested in traditional 401(k) plans; they’re diving into stocks, crypto, and yes, even starting businesses. Their creativity is contagious!

- **Retirement is a *mindset*.** 🧠
  We’ve all seen the viral posts about “retiring in your 30s” or buying beach houses in your 40s. It shifts the focus from merely saving to *living*. Why wait to travel the world until you’ve punched your retirement card? This mindset is reshaping what retirement even means—and I’m here for it!

Now, let’s be real for a second: We’ve all had those days where planning feels *overwhelming*. There’s a lot to juggle—bills, student loans, and the constant quest for “adulting” status. But what if we just took a breath and distanced ourselves from the chaos? 

Here’s a fun thought experiment: imagine your ideal retirement. What does it look like? Is it sipping coffee by the beach, hiking through national parks, or code-crunching from your laptop in a cozy café? **Dream big!** ✨

Wrapping this all up is a reminder that we’re collectively navigating uncharted waters. Being part of these online communities means sharing the load and crafting our futures together. 

So, what do you think? How are you seeing these energetic, future-minded approaches affect your planning? Let’s keep this conversation going!",1,1746713745.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False
