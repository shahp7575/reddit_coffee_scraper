(Pictures and Voice Memo in Post! Willing to Travel or Relocate for the Right Person!)","**As a quick preface, I would really appreciate it if you read the entire post! I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Nier Automata, Signalis, and Rune Factory 4. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I have been involved in several CIA backed attempts to overthrow legally elected leaders in foreign countries, specifically between the years of 1960 and 1985.
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-40 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~In 1964, the United States was involved in a coup against Brazilian leader João Goulart, specifically providing fuel and weapons to military rebels, as well as assisting in organizing street protests against Goulart. This lead to Goulart’s overthrow and a subsequent 20-year long military dictatorship. Were you in any way, shape, or form, involved in this operation?


Uh...no comment.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

At least, that's what it says I do on paper, but I do much more than just picking up donations. At the end of the year, I am getting back into EMT work.



I'm always up for a cup of coffee or going out for a drink and a good conversation is always an enjoyable accompaniment to that.

Some of my other interests include:

Hiking, backpacking/camping, hammocking, baking bread, watching really good movies that provide fantastic discussions (e.g. Shrek, Fiddler on the Roof, Peanut Butter Falcon) \[bad movies such as Birdemic: Shock & Terror or Airplane vs. Volcano are also a pleasure\], sword fighting, having long, solid talks with people, games (tabletop, RPG, and videogames), chess, folk/contra dances, and visiting museums and art galleries.



I'm a bit of a wandering soul, although not by choice. Grew up in China for ten years, then Canada for eight, and then made my way to the US. Never lived in any town longer than 5 years, although I'm hoping to beat my record here in Spokane. My parents were foreign workers in China. I myself grew up in a Baptist family. I made the choice to submit to God when I was in jr. high (summer of 2013), but had always accepted the faith of Christianity as a fact of life. I had a fairly significant deconstruction of my Baptist beliefs in 2023 and reconstruction into something different that I'm not sure how to put words to (not liberal theology just to make that clarification). I've been attending the Anglican church I am currently at for a short amount of time (less than a year), but I've found good people there, been able to have productive conversations about my beliefs there, and find much good health in the life of the Church.



Deal breakers for me are smoking (pipe tobacco and cigars are exceptions), not wanting children in the future (I'd like to be a dad thanks), and having children of your own (but not be a dad that fast). I'd prefer to have a decent amount of crossover in interests, (3 or 4 shared interests) and being able to be outdoors with other people is pretty important to me so it would be nice to meet someone who enjoys being outside.

# Background:

My husband and I were child-free since we met in college. We went through all of our 20s and over half our 30s as very firmly child-free. Then something changed. I think it was a trip to Paris, where we ate and drank and did everything we wanted to do. It was pure hedonism, and it should've made us happy. Instead, it highlighted to us that no matter how great our lives were, something felt hollow, like we were lacking meaning.

Meaning can come from a lot of different sources, but we didn't have any of those (family/friends far away, careers good but not meaningful, not religious, no big hobbies). *In retrospect,* I think this was a bad reason to have a kid, as having a kid doesn't automatically give you meaning (at least not for me).

Anyway, after fencesitting and reading this forum for a few years, I pulled the plug on my IUD and we switched to cycle-tracking as our only birth control while trying to figure out what to do. This part sucks, as you all know, and a part of me hoped the decision would be made for me somehow. Well, a few cycles into it, we were irresponsible once (ovulating, we ran out of condoms, and I said it was fine to proceed) and bam. Pregnant at 38 years old. I think I knew as soon as it happened.

# Pregnancy:

As soon as I was pregnant, I went into autopilot, and booked all the Dr appointments, started taking supplements, made spreadsheets on what to buy, and even stopped drinking coffee.

But a week into it, I finally processed it, and went into a full on panic spiral. I took the day off of work and read r/regretfulparents until I was pretty certain I'd made a massive mistake. I told my husband that I didn't want to keep the baby, and he seemed shaken, but said he'd support me. I picked up the abortion pill (don't live in the US) after work. But everytime I contemplated taking it, I'd come up with a reason to wait. Taking the pill felt 'wrong' to me in an intuitive way. I wrote down all the reasons I shouldn't have the baby, and then decided, F it, we're having this baby anyway, and threw away the pill (apologies for wasting resources).

The pregnancy was fine except for some gender disappointment. I always pictured having a little girl, so when I found out it was a boy, I went back to panicking and feeling regretful. I was sure I was 1 and done, but now I'd never have a girl. I didn't want a hyper / rambunctious boy at all. Was a bit depressed for awhile over this.

# Birth:

Giving birth was worse than I thought it'd be. I'm good at managing pain, but this was somethin else. I had 'back labor' and thanks to a lack of resources at the hospital I was birthing in, had to wait 6 hours (pure agony) for an epidural. Once the epidural was in, labored for another 10 hours, and they kept saying I wasn't dilated enough, and were pumpling me full of pitocin to speed up the labor. My uterus was duing backflips and the baby's heartrate was all of the place. Turns out, I'd been dilated for a long time, but the passageway was blocked by the membraines around the baby. The only way forward was an emergency C-Section. It was honestly fine. I was glad for it to be done.

The moment I met my baby, I felt a sense of peace. I knew I'd do anything to protect the little guy. I don't know about overwhelming love, but it was more like ""this is mine to protect"".

# Postpartum recovery:

I'd been very active throughout my pregnancy, and healed up pretty quick in that I was walking around the next day and within a few weeks, was doing some challening hikes. I had some issues with recovery mostly bc I have a hard time resting (incision was infected, got nipple thrush from the antibiotics used to treat the infection, incision started opening a bit, stitches popped out) but by my 6 week check up, all was healed. C-sections are not the easy way out, and even with people who say they healed quickly, the incision takes awhile to settle.

My pelvic floor had somehow gotten overly tight, and even 6 months after, need to go to physical therapy to help loosen it up back to normal. It hurts too much to have sex, and so we don't, which has been difficult.

# Sleep:

Sleep, or lack of, has been the hardest part of all of this. I didn't realize that when I decided to exclusively breastfeed, that it meant I'd be doing 100% of night duty. In my head, I thought somehow we'd share nights, or do shifts. But when the baby just needs a little boob time to settle, it doesn't make sense for both parents to be up.

My baby gets up every 2-3 hours to eat, through the day, and through the whole night. In 6+ months, I haven't had more than a 3 hour stretch of consecutive sleep. I feel emotional just thinking about sleep, and am sure I've gotten a lot dumber this year.

My husband and I sleep in seperate bedrooms so he can sleep through the night, and then around 5am, I feed the baby and hand him to my husband, and then I get 2-3 hours of uninterrupted sleep. That last bit of morning sleep has saved my sanity.

The sleep regressions have been brutal, especially the famous 4 month regression. He was up every 30-45 mintues through the night, and I almost lost my mind. We're currently attempting to 'gently' sleep train the guy, but so far it's been hit/miss.

# Parenting:

A lot of early parenting depends on what kind of baby you get, but also your attitude. I love my little guy so much, but he's been a very difficult baby. He screams when you put him down, only naps on a person or in a carrier, won't tolerate sleeping in a crib, or sitting in a car seat, took 5+ months to tolerate sitting in a stroller/pram, refused baths (have to shower him), refused bottles, had a bad latch, had colic/reflux so spent hours screaming everyday until he was 3 months old, insists on eating every few ours even at 6 months, and is generally very 'high needs.'

We decided to roll with it, and have done a ton of traveling while on parental leave. We realized that they key was to go outside as much as possible, so we strap him on, and walk. He's completely happy/chill as long as we're outside. We've been to 4+ countries over the last 6 months, and it's been good.

The older he gets, the easier it gets too. He's now so giggly, smiley and fun. His laugh is like the best dopamine hit. It's also so cool seeing his face twist up or light up when he tries new food. I'm excited to see how he grows and who he becomes.

# Relationship:

This has been hard. My husband and I are rock solid, he's my bestie and has been since we were 19. I suspect my husband has postpartum anxiety (dudes can get it), as he's always worrying about random shit ('we need to check pollution levels', 'microplastics!', 'research every ingredient in his diaper cream', etc..). My husband is absolutely obsessed with this baby, and during the day, is the primary parent.

Having a baby will compound even the smallest issues/fights you had before. My husband and I used to occasionally fight bc I don't like my in-laws (with good reason). Well, this came to such a head when I was just a few weeks postpartum. Won't go into details, but it was so hard.

Our relationship has definitely suffered. We argue at least once a day about the stupidest stuff you can imagine (partly due to me not sleeping enough, partly due to his anxiety, and partly bc we're dumb like that).

But I know it's a season, and our foundation is strong enough that we'll be fine.

# Reflections:

I love my little guy more everyday. **Don't regret a thing**. If I (+ my husband) didn't have generous parental leave, or was strapped financially, this might've been a nightmare, so I do acknowledge my privilege.  This might have also been so much easier if my baby was 'easy' and slept well, but you get what you get.

I think **having a baby doesn't give meaning, but rather, you're so distracted, you don't care anymore.** I'm now on a lower level of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, so don't need to worry about self-actualizing. If I'd known this before having a baby, I might have doubled down on looking for meaningful hobbies or something instead of having a baby to scratch that itch in my life.

In an alternate world where I didn't have my baby, my life would be a lot easier. I don't think I appreciated just have simple/easy/free it was. I didn't appreciate how much time I had. If I'd wanted to, I could sleep as much as I wanted! I could go to the gym for a long time and nobody would be mad. I could have uninterrupted laptop time, for hours and hours! **I grieve this** old life, and do feel weepy when I think about it too much.

It's also easy to spell out all the ways my life is harder now, but **harder to explain the absolute joy** I feel when snuggling with this tiny baby. His laughter is gold. He's all big eyes, dimples, button nose, rosy cheeks, fuzzy head, and soft skin. He's absolutely gorgeous, a perfect combo of me and my favorite person, and him being 'difficult' doesn't bother me as much as pre-baby me might think. I spend more time laughing than I did before. There's a lot of joy and satisfaction in doing things for someone else (a lot of us have martyr tendencies). I 'get' why people have more than one now, but think I'll probably stop with one.",8,1765068291.0,Fencesitter,1,1.0,False

Don’t trust, don’t breathe, and DONT MISS YOUR SHOT.

1920s in Los Angeles. Dr ivar steelhammer is a robber baron and monopolistic criminal who controls the copper industry and all aspects of it. Ace (Charley/charles“ace” wulff) is a cocky and vigilantistic detective. He has been sent to look at sir Ivo’s business practices and dealings as Ivar is well known to have side projects and unlawful practices, yet there is never enough evidence to pin him. When Ace investigates, he discovers that Ivar is using leftover copper and tools to create copper soldiers he calls, “automagones” meant to make disobedient and loose lipped employees “disappear” as well as intimidate mafias during meetings. He needs to not only shut the business down through legal means, but also recover any missing employees and discover the full range of Ivar’s dealings in order to fully shut him down. 

characters :

William “Metal” steelhammer. (Actually named William wulff but thinks he’s Ivar’s son, not Norman’s)

Ivar’s adopted son, though practically ignored by Ivar parentally. Decided to make a man of himself by starting a mafia. Managed to succeed despite once being shot in the arm and thus earning the nickname “metal” due to the copper arm replacement he got (that copper arm is what hints at ace he has a connection to Ivar.). Despite his successes, his lack of acknowledgement has left him in a cycle of indulgence and intoxication to distract himself. Hates how much his father, Ivar, wanted him to be like other men and become an industrialist. While you might see him at first glance as a gambler and substance abuser, if you anger him, no matter how sober, he will put up a good fight for your life. Has red eyes, black hair, and a cobalt blue checkered velvet vest and pants (no jacket) with a red tie. Ivar works with him as his personal militia, but metal only does it to make his father proud even though it doesn’t. 
Living for the thrill, William likes to start fights with police for the fun of it, and go to shooting ranges with actual guns. He also enjoys gambling but is smart enough to know when to quit. He ignores his father’s existence when he can, and when he can’t, acts like he’s just a boss at work. 
Metal actually agrees with Ace and thinks Ivar needs to go down, though he is envious of ace’s freedom as a private eye, cause for metal he can only do what Ivar approves. This is because Ivar has forged blackmail on metal that has metal convinced he did something horrible during a drunken episode, thus controlling him, even though he never did. He still tries to help Ivar’s enemies when not supervised, however. 
Notes: fights using brass knuckles and steel tipped shoes when in melee, but has a  big iron revolver for long range and is an expert marksman, only beaten by shadow. Metal genuinely likes Amelia. She treats him like a human being, not a tool or a weapon.
He doesn’t understand what she sees in him, but he clings to it like a lifeline. He’s aware of her past with ace and both envies and resents Ace because of how he treated her during it. It pushes him to dangerous levels of anger, especially when drunk. But no matter how deep in a bender he may be, he always thinks of Amelia first.

The relationship is healthy, if hard. Amelia brings Metal coffee instead of whiskey one morning, and he actually drinks it. They argue without fighting. They listen. It’s 2 broken halves making one perfect whole.

Miles “tinker” gearson

A prodigious inventor and scrawny streets kid, miles is desperate to prove himself as more than just a freak for having vitiligo. He tried so many times to get strong enough for the LA streets, but due to pneumoconiosis gained from being forced to design the prototype for the automagones and to research the perpetua stones while in Ivar’s inhumane conditions, he couldn’t work out for long without hacking fits. So, after escaping through a vent from Ivar’s factory, he found an abandoned mafia base after a raid. After deciding no one would probably investigate it after already being busted earlier, he set up himself there to make machines that make up for his physical shortcomings. Ace smelled smoke and heard hammering from his building while on a case so he investigated thinking it to be Ivar. And that was how Ace adopted miles.

Nathaniel “knuckles” Durant

Ex boxer who works leads a rival gang against Ivo’s monopoly. Wears bandages on his hands, white shirts, and red headbands which go along good with his brown skin and black hair. Has comradeship a main virtue in his gang.

He actually has a perpetua stone and uses it to power his brass knuckles with electricity thus shocking and stunning his enemies, even once temporarily disabling metal’s arm. 

He values loyalty and honor above anything else, and that has gained him a reputation in the gang world for being the leader of the “weeping warriors” because they bury even their enemies. They don’t torture, they don’t get drunk (unless they lose) and they are all trained in martial arts.

He doesn’t act like he has feelings, tries to hide them, but has to admit he once felt love for a thief that tried stealing from him once and learned he didn’t go down without a fight. But what shocked the cat burglar was the fact that he helped her up when he beat her, and gave her some of his money, which was still a lot. “If you need it that bad, take it. I’ve got enough for myself.” Rouge would never forget. She was the thief. That started their love.

Amelia/amy “hammer” Rossetti 

Amelia is a reporter, and would be called hammer because she “brought the hammer down” on corruption using Ace’s evidence. they were once a thing, a summer fling, but Ace messed it up by choosing his job over her. It broke her heart. Now Ace has to compete for her with metal. Amelia thinks she can save him, that she can help him get over his trauma and addiction. Metal didn’t even believe in himself, but she’s the first time he considers trying. She thinks she can save him because once while working on a report, she non violently interrogated knuckles. Knuckles wasn’t scared of her, but one of knuckle’s goons negligently discharged and nearly hit her, but metal, who was sitting in the corner ran when he saw the hand grab the gun and used his metal arm to block the bullet. The firer would never be able to move again by the time knuckles was done with him. Metal had shadow take Amelia out. Amelia, being no damsel in distress, busted back in (being to this day the only person to beat shadow in a display of strength) and found metal writing down the answers to every question Amelia asked. As he left, he said, ""take care of yourself, beautiful. I don't want to see you in trouble again."" But as he opened the door to leave he said, ""but I know, you won't listen to me. At least take a weapon with you next time.” He gave her a business card Then left. Amelia had never heard Ace tell her she's beautiful and never heard a stranger say it without being creepy. And he read her so well. She can save him. All she has to do is get him to let her in.

She’s not naive. She just sees the way things are when others don’t. She sees that metal could be saved and believes she is the one for that.

She has a white collared shirt with a maroon pink skirt and black dress shoes, as well as a pink tie. She dyed her hair pink when she was with Ace , but stopped after he failed her and now it’s faded between pink and black.

Charley “Ace” wulff.

Ace has always been a runner. Running from mistakes, successes, love, hate, and anything else imaginable. He used to be cocky and idealistic in his younger days, but something happened one day on a job that made him realize no one in this world is truly pure, not even himself. He doesn’t fully trust anyone, and thinks everyone has a goal in every action they take, even going so far as to once thinking a child had a bomb strapped to them as their parent led them to the bank to show them how money works. 
Ace’s arrogant exterior cracks whenever Amelia is around. He realizes he still has feelings for her, but he’s always been someone who runs from the law, from responsibility, from heartbreak.
Watching Amelia with Metal forces Ace to reflect on his past and what he could have been for her if his job wasn’t so important to him. deep down he  hates the fact that metal IS better for Amelia than him and does things for her he never did. 
Ace started investigation because he wanted to find his father who went missing and was presumed dead in an avalanche in Alaska. Little does he know, his father is closer than he could have imagined.
But what was it that made him lose his innocence? Simple. He had thought he found a lead on his father’s disappearance, but it was just a trap by a rival investigator. Ace had to kill him to make it out alive.

He’s addicted to motion because standing still means facing what he’s lost (his father, Amelia, his humanity).

Maybe Ace keeps miles at arm’s length because he’s terrified of losing another family member — but that distance breaks miles’ heart. Miles feels inadequate. Feels not enough. 

Norman “shadow” wulff.

Norman “shadow” wulff. Bodyguard hired by metal, once frozen in ice on a bear hunting trip to Alaska, and only now unfrozen 30 years later. Known for being merciless to anyone who he’s assigned, yet refuses to kill anyone who’s a caring parent, and he doesn’t know why. Has no memory before being unfrozen, but he does know metal sees him as a fellow human being, not a killing machine, and so he has shadow’s loyalty. He is 6 feet tall, strong, and carries 2 beretta m1951s, and wields them with precision only metal can beat. He is metal’s friend and bodyguard and sometimes babysitter during metal’s benders. Will physically drag metal away from bar fights because he knows metal will win and get people killed.
Shadow doesn’t talk often to people other than metal, Ace, or amy, but when he does, it’s usually a dark joke, a promise, or a warning. He remembers having children and a life before this, but no details. He has a Polaroid in his pocket of him in better times, smiling genuinely, and holding a baby boy while his beautiful wife holds the other boy. “Maria and the greyhounds”is written on it. Shadow knows he has 2 sons, but doesn’t that they are metal and ace. Yet parental instinct still lingers on…

Perpetua stones:

Electricity producing relics that while not producing much power, require no fuel, maintenance, or degradation. Used by Ivar to power neo copperniks, and by Ace to power an exo “super suit.”

Elizabeth “bat” rouge

A cat burglar, rouge has little to no loyalties or moral values because none have been shown to her. As a female of the streets, she’s had life tougher than most, dealing with a horrible love life, abuse, fights, and near death experiences. She’s decided, “if the world has nothing good to give me, I’ll steal what I deserve.” Known for some of the most infamous heists of the past decade, she has stolen the phantom diamond which is renowned for its reflections reminding whoever holds it of whatever they want the most, the angel’s emerald once thought to be able to boost the perpetua stones but that myth has yet to be proven nor disproven, and a perpetua stone. Ace has tried and failed to catch her multiple times and might have to bend his rules to steal something of value for her in order to get information in Ivar’s security measures and building layout. They have an on off relationship which is confusing for both sides. Metal has once commented, “jeez, just pick in or out. Do you love her or not? You keep this up, you’ll break my darling Amelia’s heart with how quickly you moved on.” Metal both hates Ace for how he treated Amy , and is jealous of him for how free he is.

She knows the world sees her as a temptress and a thief, and she weaponizes that image to survive. But underneath? She’s exhausted by it. That’s why she loves knuckles. Because he sees it, doesn’t want it, and chooses the real her, scars and all. 

she mentors runaway girls, and secretly donates to orphanages under an alias.
She’d hate anyone finding out — it’d destroy her reputation — but it’s her way of not becoming nihilistic and depressed. 

Knuckles is not her mirror of pain like Ace. Knuckles is her emotional support, her crutch when things seem hopeless, and her safe space. Knuckles sometimes leaves valuables on his windowsill just so he can catch a glimpse of her smiling as she steals from him consensually.

Ivar steelhammer:

July 18th, 1914.

Mud. Blood. Fire. A coppery tang in the back of his throat.
Ivar had no business being on the front lines — not with a genius-level IQ and a doctorate in engineering. But brains didn’t matter when America began drafting due to the Perpetua Stones being involved.

His father, Gerald, had discovered them in Germany. Ancient, humming rocks that emitted low-voltage energy without heat, decay, or fuel. Clean power. Eternal. And instantly, every government wanted them.

That’s how this war started.

Ivar hated those stones. Hated his father for unearthing them. Hated the politicians for weaponizing them.
He just wanted to survive the day. Maybe get back to the tent and see Maria, his sister, who’d been conscripted as a medic after Gerald pulled strings. Not even 25, and she was already deployed.

A bullet cracked past his ear. He didn’t hear the gun — just the wind of death brushing his cheek.
He ducked, fired back.

A scream.

Four.
Five was the number they gave. Five kills and you could return to base for rest.

He ran.

The tent came into view. Familiar canvas flapping in the wind.

He smiled.

And then he stopped smiling.

Bodies.
Strewn like broken marionettes. Medic’s bags torn open. Blood mixing with morphine in the dirt.

Maria’s tent was one of them.

He dropped to his knees.

And screamed.

1919.

He should have walked away. But something snapped in that trench — something permanent.
If people had listened to logic — to science — none of this would’ve happened.
So Ivar did what he knew best.

He built.

Automatons.
Mechanical men.
A vision from an old Greek codex, updated with his own mind and modern copper.
They didn’t tire. They didn’t bleed. They didn’t feel.

They wouldn’t make the mistakes humans made.

He would prevent another war — even if he had to control every human soul to do it.

Years passed. The automaton prototypes were a success. Corporations bought in. The Copper Age began.

Then, the letters started.

From someone calling himself William steelhammer. Claimed to be Ivar’s son. Claimed Maria was his late mother.
Impossible. Maria was dead now and Gerald was gone. The war had ended, but its echoes hadn’t.

The boy wrote again and again.

“You are my father now, Ivar.”
“I want to meet you.”
“You’re the only family I have left.”
“Please.” 
“I’ll be good.”
“you can’t abandon me too.”

Ivo ignored them.

“I’ll be useful.”

Hmm. An opportunity formed in his mind.

It wasn’t safe. Assassinations were becoming common — union men, journalists, even rival scientists.

Besides… it couldn’t be true.

Could it?

He remembered Maria had a husband before she died. A man named… Norman Greyhound? A bear hunter from Alaska. Missing in action. Presumed dead. Maria had mentioned children. Twin boys.

One of them could be this “William.”The other? Ivar wasn’t sure. But he had the sinking feeling he’d see him again — just not the way he expected.

1927.

Today, Ivar steelhammer controls 95% of the American copper market.
From mining to refinement to weapons manufacturing.
He built an empire on the thing that ruined his life. And he’s using it to build something better.
A world without chaos. Without rebellion. Without weakness.

The automagones, copper soldiers with Perpetua cores, ensure order in the workforce. They don’t question. They don’t disobey. They make “problems” disappear.
He still dreams of Maria sometimes.
Her voice, warm and kind, echoing over the gunfire.
She’d hate what he became.
But he doesn’t care.
The world doesn’t need kindness.
The world needs control.
And he’s the only man alive who can give it.
Philanthropists try to cure symptoms of humanity’s evil. He’s going to cure the disease humanity is even if he has to include himself in the crossfire.

Season layout

Keep in mind it will mostly be from Ace’s/metal’s pov but don’t be afraid to switch if it adds plot relevance or character development. Hell, it might be metal’s pov for an episode just to show how much shadow cares for him during his benders. Doesn’t advance plot at all, but 100% advances character development. (Not saying we have to do that, just an example.). For pacing, I’d say avatar the last airbender (mostly character development but with every episode a little bit (with some more than others) of plot development so it’s not just episode after episode with no end until it loses revenue.). Know when to end it so you don’t milk it for money but also don’t make it too short cause that’s being a marketing dick.

If you’re gonna do merch, do not do limited edition sales cause that’s evil and they sell out in seconds.

If you’re gonna do teasers, don’t just show characters as that tells nothing. Show teaseworthy content.

If you’re gonna do merch, include every main character as someone loves them.

Note: all the stuff written anywhere here is subject to change.

Themes to keep in mind for each character.

Metal: wanting what Ace has and wanting to be better than Ace. How constant failure/being failed affects someone.

Ace: loss. Be it losing, the effects of losing someone or something, or not wanting to lose someone or something, it’s all loss.

Amy: trust. Trust being broken, being trusted, learning to trust again, and not trusting. All trust. 

Miles: hope and help. He is the calm in Ace’s storm of a life. He is resilient and won’t let himself die till he knows there’s nothing else he can do for others. But his need to help gets him in trouble sometimes.

Shadow: love. It may not seem like it, but he tries to love. He protects metal, even if not knowing why. He once fought knuckles, but not to beat him. To teach him to fight. He loves Ace as a son (without knowing) and tries to keep him out of trouble. He is wary of Amelia but respects her as someone with a zeal in her heart.

Rogue: barriers to keep herself safe physically, but it harms her mentally and emotionally. Those who are abandoned, those who are ignored, they are shown in her.

Knuckles: denial. Idealism in a cynical world.

Ivar: control, fear (of others), the price of power, neglect, and silent insanity. 

Whole story: pain, scars, and hiding vs not hiding scars and feelings.

Quotes I thought of: 

Metal: “you’ve reached the residency of Mr hot body, how may I help you?” “Dis is me, yes, just a little boozy… please hold.” “Hon, i swear I sometimes cannot handle the amount of sass we simultaneously can have.” “You sir, have crossed the fucking line.” “Rouge. I mean no disrespect but if you flirt with me again I’ll have to break your pretty face.” “Cmon shadow, I’m not drunk, just wobbly… gimme.” “I’m getting tired and I need something to rely on.” 

Sonic: “oh simple life, where have you gone?” “No. You aren’t my father. Maybe once… but not anymore.” “I… I understand you Ivar. I really do. You are grieving. And you want to stop others from grieving too. But this can’t be how it’s done. I’m sorry but by doing this you cause more grief than you prevent.” “I still love you Amy. But I won’t chase you anymore. Because I know you deserve better. You deserve him. Metal, I mean. I’ll leave you alone. Have fun dancing. Just… stay safe, alright? Cause someone out there really cares about you.” 

Knuckles: “A fight’s not over when you win. It’s over when you’ve done what’s right.”

Opening:

The copper skyline gleams under streetlamps. Posters for steelhammer industry Copper & Steel line the rain-slick streets. A single drop of rain hits a glowing sign — letters flickers out, leaving “S IN S.”
Then — cut to the pub. 

Rain taps against the windows, steady and cold.

Metal slouches in the corner of the dim pub, eyes half-hidden under the brim of his hat. Shadow sits beside him, wordless, waving off the waitress each time Metal reaches for another bottle. The air smells of smoke, cheap whiskey, and rain-soaked coats. 

A bell rings. The pub pauses for a moment, fearing police. For a moment, all you hear is the rain. Then they go back to their drinks. Ace is here. Metal watches as Ace orders a shot of brandy. He wonders “so this is him. The one who broke my boo’s heart and made her the wonderful woman she is today.” Ace drinks. Metal smirks, and thinks, “stick to your sorrows, old man. I won’t let you hurt my girl again.,” as he gets up and walks out. Shadow follows, stopping at the door to look at Ace closely, then as if remembering something, quickly follows metal. 

Ace is left with himself and a drink. In the reflection of the brandy he sees a woman with pink hair walking outside, talking and smiling with metal. His one tear mixes with the brandy.

1pg4pth,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pg4pth/figured_out_why_i_was_getting_inconsistent_shots/,Figured out why I was getting inconsistent shots with the Breville Barista Pro,"I was having trouble getting consistent shots with some older dark roast coffee (Peet's Major Dickason) that is probably about 4 months off roast.

After experimenting a bunch I was able to make it really consistent (only about 1s difference between shots).

The breville barista pro seems to need to be pre-heated otherwise the water that first comes out isn't that hot. I'm guessing it's because the group head is cold. Running a couple blank shots right before seems to make it way more consistent.

I'm guessing because the beans are older, it doesn't release as much co2 when the water isn't up to temperature, so it ends up causing a lot more channeling.

I also ended up not doing any pre-infusion and NOT doing RDT - removed these when trying to isolate the issue, and it seems like they aren't necessary for this bean. I haven't tested that much if pre-infusion is making it less consistent. It could be that because it's an older dark roast, that it's breaking down the puck before full pressure hits.

I still do WDT - without it's way worse.

It's more house than we've had before, and we're slowly growing into the space. We're very happy with the setup of the living room and the playroom, but the ""dining room"" (I believe the room was intended to be more of a formal sitting room) is proving difficult. The room is \~13.5'x27' and runs the full depth of the house. It has an interior fireplace, two entry ways (one from the foyer and another from the hallway attached to the kitchen), and 6 windows (two at the front of the house, two at the back, and two off the side opposite the fireplace).

  
We had initially set up the dining room table to be centered on the doorway coming from the kitchen, and a couch, chair, and coffee table on the other half of the room, but this felt like such wasted space. We've now moved the dining room table to be in the center of the room, and are again struggling with how to use the rest of the space.

I wake up every day at 5 am, make my coffee and smoke a cigarette, then start watching my show. I guess that bothers my son’s wife because she will get up in a huff when I turn on the tv and take the baby out, which typically wakes her up because she’ll start crying as she gets up. 
My son approached me today and asked if I could watch the show in my room in the morning because I’ve been waking his wife and the baby up in the morning and the baby has been sleeping poorly at night. I told him his wife’s comfort isn’t my concern and I like my routine.

My name is Nate, I’m 36, bi, and I’m from Minnesota. I tend to be more introverted and often spend my time hanging out at home watching tv or playing video games. Along with those two things, I also enjoy going out for coffee, going out for food/drinks, traveling, and game nights.

I’m hoping to find someone with similar interests, but also some unique ones, that I could try with you; if we end up liking each other enough to visit or do online together. 

What I want in a partner - I like goofy/nerdy guys. Must have a good sense of humor and geek out on something. I want someone caring, kind, and respectful. Someone that enjoys hugs, cuddles, and a little romance. I tend to like masculine, slim, younger guys. I like guys that are more slim, simply because, I myself am what others may call, a short king. Haha I’m not a big guy, but what I enjoy most, is wrapping my arms around your waste, holding you close.

Anyways, if this sounds similar or comforting to you, send me a message. :) You do not have to be from Minnesota, or even, the US. 

I probably won’t respond to people that just say, “Hey” or have a plank profile. If you can see me, I should be able to see you.

Hey everyone. I am putting myself out there to meet new people and hopefully build some easy, genuine connections. I am mainly looking for friendship to start. Good conversations, shared interests, someone to laugh with and feel comfortable around. If things naturally grow into something more, I am definitely open to that as well.

A little about me:
I am 33, born and raised in Michigan. I enjoy anything outdoors during the warmer months. Hiking, kayaking, camping, random day trips, bonfires, and pretty much anything that gets me outside. Once winter arrives, I switch into a more relaxed, at home mode. I enjoy reading, watching good shows, drinking coffee, and just enjoying calm nights in with the right person.

Personality wise, I am friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to. Once I am comfortable with someone, I can be silly, sarcastic, and playful. I love to laugh and I enjoy people who do the same. I appreciate genuine and consistent communication without anything forced or awkward. Just two people getting to know each other at their own pace.

What I am hoping to find:
Someone who wants to talk, share stories, joke around, and build something real. Whether it becomes a solid friendship or turns into something deeper, I am open to either. I am not expecting anything instantly. I just want good energy and a natural connection with someone who is also looking for something meaningful.

I am in a weird situation in my life. 



Some background info: 48M married to 42F. 2 kids 17 and 16. 

Finances: Have $3M in investments. See the breakdown below. Kids 529 plan is funded outside of this. 

Regular Investment Account: $985K

Roth IRA: $440K

IRA: $700K

401K: $875K

Have a paid off rental property which generates about $30K/year. 

Primary home has an outstanding mortagage of $400K with a monthly payment of about $3700. 



I work for a large financial services firm as a Technology middle manager. Joined this firm couple of years ago. Our agreement was that I need to be in the building every other week regardless of wherever I live. I live in a different city about 1000 miles away from the closest base location. Obviously I had to take a flight, stay in a hotel/airbnb for 4 nights, rent a car etc (uber is expensive)., I pay for all these expenses from my pocket. Over the last year, I have been shuttling back and forth. It goes without saying - this impacted my health, as I dont sleep very well if I dont sleep in my bed, eat outside - ended up getting diagnosed with prediabetics etc., While I am away I miss my wife and the boys. Next year my older one will go to college, I dont know how much are we going to spend time with him except the holidays when he comes home.  



My work situation: 50% of my compensation is tied in bonus and stocks. I have been at this level for over 10 years and I can do the job with minimal effort. We do quarterly performance reviews and for the first 3 quarters of the year, I was rated as 2 out of 5, meaning exceeding expectations. I was expecting to receive 100% of my target bonus, which is about $200K/year. Given, I could do the job with minimal effort and being a decent performer at work, over the last year, I made a mistake of doing ""coffee badging"" at work on Mondays and Fridays to maximize time at home. A month ago, my boss informed me that I made it to the naughty list from productivity perspective - I spent less than an hour in the building on Mondays and Fridays 30% of the time - he claimed that HR showed him videos of me doing coffee badging. I took accountability for my mistake. It was recorded in the HR system of this behavior and was given a warning that any future deviation from being in the office will result in termination. I was moved from rating of ""2"" to ""5"" and was given zero bonus.



 The culture of the organization is ""you need to have your ass in the seat"" and nothing else matters. As a middle manager, I did compensation numbers for my entire org and everyone who showed up to work consistently got their target bonuses. 



The job itself is easy. Given I lost my bonus, i have no motivation to work. Also, the travel every other week makes it even demotiviating to go to work. Job market is such that I am unable to find a role locally in the city i live in or remote opportunity at the same level. My wife works locally and she enjoys her job and she wants to work until she turns atleast 50 - my kids and I are on my wife's medical insurance.



Given my finances, I was considering to quit my job and take it easy for few months. I can obviously take care of health, reverse prediabetics etc., But my wife is concerned that I would be stressed out. I am not sure which stress is bad - with the current job that includes travel with a standard paycheck where i need to be in the building for 8 hours every day where I work only 2-4 hours and sit on useless meetings all day and deal with flight delays every friday evening OR sitting at home alone when kids and wife are out of the house with nothing to look forward to. My identity is tied to work, so I dont know if I can deal with that either. 



Given my finances, I am not sure if I am ready to retire. Current expenses are at $120K/year and will remain same during retirement. My wife's income can help us with running the family until she retires - she wont be able to contribute to 401K or anything like that. 



I can use some perspectives from redditors to decide my future.

two months ago I met a girl at school. I (30M) was put in a group partnership with her (23F). We both hit it off right away regardless of our age and I thought she was older cause it was a night class. 

We would meet up 30min before for coffee, and we would flirt through text. We also talked on the phone the whole day while we were both  at work. 

When we would be partnered together I would get texts from her to keep my eyes to myself like messing around. One day I asked her why she says that if she liked me to let me know since we can get serious and she said she was waiting on my to tell her cause I’m the guy. I do tell her and we entered the “talking stage”

I told her that I like her and want to take her on a date and she just said whatever you’re putting me against a wall with this question and both got into our cars. 

We haven’t talked since and that was two days ago, good thing schools almost over. I was wondering if I messed something up or why she keeps making it seem like she likes me and pulls back when I ask her on dates. ",1,1765067048.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Especially in high school, lectures and school has been a bit harder to focus in. With all the homework I get and tests, I feel overwhelmed and just end up not studying or doing the hw and just bedrotting, mindlessly scrolling on my devices (yes, I know it’s bad). My grades are only fine because I end up doing my homework last minute, the day of, in homeroom. Maybe it’s because I grew up as the “smart kid” so I didn’t have to learn to study, which led to my lack of studying in high school or maybe it’s the fact that I’m addicted to my phone (so what my mom said when I brought this up).

Embarrassingly enough to admit, my weekends are spent in my room bed rotting and just on my electronics with copious amounts of screen time (I’ve been an angsty kid and my parents are soft on me so they don’t usually bother me, plus both my parents are at work all day. I’m also the oldest.) I have trouble keeping up habits (cleaning room, countless amounts of hobbies I’ve tried to stick to—piano, reading, journaling, movies, crochet, painting, sports, etc—and temporary hyperfixations) and get side tracked very easily.

TBH I’ve always been like this so maybe I’m just a naturally lazy person but I’m just worried that if Highschool is like this for me, how am I supposed to do college ☠️ I’m going into pre-health/public health as a major as well. If I do study, I usually do good and grasp onto material well but it’s hard for me to physically start studying and it takes me a while (I use the writing notes, memorizing, and active recall method). Oh but recently, I’ve just started drinking coffee and it’s a whole new game changer for me. The only downsides are that I’m worried it’s gonna stain my teeth and that I’ll build a tolerance by the time I get to college so I’ll need more!

In short, I have trouble focusing in school, in conversations, eat out of boredom, have trouble keeping hobbies, mood swings, and am an extreme procrastinator. I genuinely don’t know if I’m just lazy or this is normal or if this is not normal and it’s worth getting tested.

I had an ex I broke up with in 2016. It was a messy breakup, and it took me almost six years to fully move on. By 2023, I finally felt healed. I haven’t contacted her once in these seven years completely cold turkey.
Recently, I happened to see her ID online and noticed some posts from cafés and restaurants near my place in Islamabad. I’m fully over her and have no interest in restarting anything. But here’s the thing about me: I’m a very “philosopher type” or ig person. I’m always curious about the other side of the story and how different people experience the same event. Understanding perspectives is part of who I am.
So a thought came to me should I message her and ask if she’d be open to meeting for a friendly coffee (strictly as acquaintances)? I’d like to ask her a few questions, not to reconnect emotionally, but to understand her side of that time in our lives.
For example:
* How did she experience the breakup?
* Did she remember the places visited?
* How long did it take her to move on?
* Was it easier or harder for her compared to my experience?
It’s not about reopening old feelings it’s more like wanting to understand a chapter of my life from a different angle. Almost like a personal “case study” for closure or curiosity. I’m even fine if she brings her partner or a friend.
My question is:Is it okay to send her a respectful message asking if she’d be open to a coffee chat? Or is it better to leave the past alone and keep moving forward?.

1pg4apy,https://www.reddit.com/r/vending/comments/1pg4apy/upgrading_thermoplan_blackwhite_3_into_a_vending/,Upgrading Thermoplan Black&White 3 into a vending machine.,"Hello everyone. I need help from a specialist or someone who has ever set a similar goal. I have a Thermoplan Black&White 3 coffee machine. I need to upgrade it to a vending machine. My idea and logic were: Get a Nayax system and connect it to my machine (more specifically, find out if this machine has an MDB standard or a pulse input).
For the coffee machine to function as a vending machine:
The customer selects a drink on the coffee machine.
The machine should not start brewing until the payment signal.
Nayax accepts the payment.
Nayax sends a ""paid"" pulse.
The machine starts brewing. There are important parameters in the admin menu:
1) ""Product Prices""
This isn't for the customer—these are the drink prices that will be compared with the payment signal (pulse/MDB).
If you're setting up a vending machine:
You set a price for each drink, for example:
Espresso — 50
Cappuccino — 70
Latte — 80
These values ​​are needed so that:
Nayax can use the impulse to determine which product is selected.
The machine knows what price to expect from the payment system.",1,1765066640.0,vending,0,1.0,False

1pg4934,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1pg4934/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described as a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface began to stir, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/r/mrcreeps. The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building, the foundations, of his next masterpiece.

1pg41wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1pg41wf/i_think_my_dog_is_haunting_me/,I think my dog is haunting me,"My 14 year old dog passed away suddenly Thursday night. I raised him since he was a puppy and he followed me around like a shadow his entire life. I know everyone says this but he was genuinely my best friend. 

I’ve been staying at my parents for a little over a month, and he and I have spent a lot of time here in the past. Without going into any details (that are still very traumatic for me), he died here in the house. Like I said, it was very unexpected and he declined quickly. Literally 24 hours before he passed, he was playing, wagging his tail, and being his normal cuddly self.

With this, the shift in energy of the house has been stark. To go from a house with an active, playful dog to one without.. it’s palpable. It was like there was this constant hum or white noise that’s suddenly gone.

Last night I first noticed something next to my bed (where he’d sleep) out of the corner of my eye. The bed is raised so when he’d stand up, I could really only see the top of his head and the tip of his tail *trot trot trotting* around for a goodnight pet or to see if I was awake in the mornings. But I swear, last night as I stared straight ahead, praying for sleep, I saw something move. 

I had been crying all day and thought maybe there was crap in my eyes from wiping them so much (still possible), but my mom told me tonight that she’s been seeing things out of the corner of her eye too. My bedroom is around the corner and down a hallway, and she’s been seeing perpetual movement back and forth (the route he’d take to my bedroom).

And then my dad, without my mom and I discussing what we saw, sat down for dinner at the coffee table like he’s done every night for the past month+ we’ve been here. And every night when my dog was alive, he’d *trot trot trot* over to my dad’s side and lay there while he ate. Tonight, my dad sat down and was like “is there a door open?” and my mom and I both said no. And then he said “I just felt a big gust of cold wind next to me”.

I joked “aw man, [my dog] must be here” and my mom looked at me and told me she’s been seeing movement in the hallway all day. That’s when I told her about what I saw last night too.

I don’t know if anyone has experience with this, (pets specifically) but my mom and I have both seen spirits in the past and I’m very much a believer, and it makes sense with my dog’s sudden shift in energy that he might be confused about what happened to him.

I would personally love for him to be haunting me. The last two days have been the absolute worst of my life. The pain is indescribable. And I hope just as he acted as my shadow in life, I can continue to feel him around me after.

Been testing AI humanizers for the past few weeks because I got tired of my ChatGPT drafts getting flagged everywhere. Ran the same 300-word sample through a bunch of tools and checked results with Turnitin and GPTZero.

Here's what actually worked:



**#1 Rephrasy**

This one blew me away. The standout feature is the custom writing style cloning — you can train it on your own writing samples and it actually learns your voice. Not just generic ""make it sound human"" stuff. 

For the AI Detection I used their Models like they explain in their tutorials. The Undetectable one which worked extremly good against Turnitin, in 5 tries it always scored below 10% AI after humanization. The v2 Model is against GPTZero and also did a good job, here I actually had 2 samples where I needed to re-humanize the text to fully bypass.



**#2 Undetectable AI**

Solid runner-up. It lowered the score in both Detectors. The issue is that it never made it below 40% on Turnitin and in 2 out of the 5 samples it couldn't get below 100% AI on GPTZero.  


**#3 StealthGPT**

This one is interesting as I had to choose between many different models which confused me a lot. Got 1/5 samples with 98% human on GPTZero in my tests. The others were all flagged, also on Turnitin > 50% AI. Also the pricing is too high for me especially with the quality..

  
I also tried some free tools like this new Clever Humanizer, it did work for a few samples 3/5 on GPTZero but 5/5 samples got flagged on Turnitin which makes it unsuable even tho its free. The paid other tools I tested are not really worth to mention as they couldn't get around AI Detection at all.

In January, after a long battle with Hasbrouck Heights, the fire inspector finally stepped in and abruptly shut the diner down for a well outdated fire suppression system. 

It was a well publicized event, and led to blind owner John Diakakis putting the property up for sale in late spring.

I'm 29, work in tech, fully remote for the past 3 years. I drink every single day. Usually start around 2-3pm with a beer or two while working, then wine with dinner, then more wine or whiskey in the evening. I'd estimate 6-8 drinks per day on average, more on weekends. And the thing is... my life looks fine from the outside: I've never missed work or a deadline because of drinking, I pay my bills on time, I exercise 4x a week, I have a good relationship with my girlfriend (who doesn't know the full extent of my drinking).

But. I think about drinking all day. Like, literally planning when I can have my first drink. I've tried to take ""days off"" from alcohol and made it maybe 2 days max before I start getting anxious and irritable. I hide the recycling from my girlfriend so she doesn't see how many bottles accumulate. My hands shake slightly in the mornings until I have coffee (or is that the coffee causing it? I honestly don't know anymore). My memory is getting worse - I'll have entire conversations I don't remember.

Reading about it made me realize: just because my life hasn't completely fallen apart doesn't mean I don't have a problem. But I keep going back and forth. Some days I think ""You're being dramatic, lots of people drink daily."" Other days I think ""You literally can't go 48 hours without alcohol, that's not normal.""

1pg3uho,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pg3uho/i_lost_connection_with_my_old_high_school_friend/,I lost connection with my old high school friend and years later I found out what happened to him.,"My friend I'll call Spirit, I've known her (Him now I guess?) since kindergarten. We went to the same school up until college. They were such an odd person when I knew them in school, they're still odd now. But not in the bad odd a good odd. It was in high school I really started to notice them. In freshman year they wore such cute outfits then something happened and they started covering up. I'm not sure it was slowly over time that they just started wearing hoodies and stopped wearing skirts.

By senior year they were pretty depressed and I tried to talk to them but they never responded. Not sure if they actually noticed or if they just didn't want help. When we graduated Spirit just disappeared off the face of the planet. I didn't have their socials and they were pretty private. I was pretty upset because I had a crush on them and I knew I missed my opportunity but I wanted to give Spirit space and let them try to get better, I lost them after high school so I moved on.

I recently moved to a bigger city so I can get a better job in my chosen field. Also better night life since the small town I came from was dead and didn't have anything to do other than 4 dozen bars that were mediocre at best.

One of the night clubs I went too had a familiar face on stage. It was Spirit and another person I'll refer to as Silo. They were quite electric on stage. In-between songs Spirit would make jokes and interact with the audience and one of the jokes that I remember clearly was how Spirit joked about Silo being cage. Silo was the drummer for a majority of songs and the drums were in a glass box. It was just so odd to me.

There were a few others on stage but it was mainly just Spirit and Silo, everyone swapped between instruments too. they had stage fighting, acting, telling stories with their music. It was actually really engaging.

They're pretty big in the city now and it seems they're gaining more attention. I actually ran into him a few days ago at a tattoo studio. Like he was fully passed out getting an armband(?) tattoo done. Some of the other tattooers were joking about how easy of a canvas he was.

When he got up and was getting ready to head out I caught him and told him long time no see.

He was actually pretty confused on who I was and asked where I knew him from. I told him high school and he said he didn't remember Highschool at all and that was a pretty horrible time for him because of what happened. I told him my name and there was some spark of recognition. He said he remember I was decently nice to him, but otherwise didn't really remember who I was. I asked if we could talk over coffee or something He said he was pretty busy and wouldn't have a lot of time. But we managed to set up a time and we met.

He never once mentioned high school, he just talked about how he moved to the big city, worked as a classic car restorer and custom car fabricator and has already made a shit ton of money. and he also is obviously a musician in his free time.

The one thing that broke me was that Silo is actually his partner. I don't know why I felt that way, but I was heart broken. He talked about how Silo took the time to actually get to know him and never forced anything out of him. Silo was actually his tattooer at first then it progressed from there.

I felt like I fucked up could've been there for Spirit and actually helped him to be better. Like I could've been more for Spirit instead of asking if he was okay and taking his answer at face value. He was pretty chill though and said he hoped to see me at some more of his shows and it seemed he didn't notice how I just fell apart in front of him. Maybe I was actually keeping it together, but fuck does it hurt to just be brushed off. I could've had this life where he's relaxing in his early 20's and not working so hard. He seems just so much happier and I had nothing to do with it.

I know it sounds selfish but I was always the guy who helped everyone with their issues. Learning that it took a lot more patience, just being there with him, and letting him unfold by himself just hurt. Like that could've been me and I could've been with my high school crush.

I still love him and it hurts that he found someone that actually took care of him. I'm happy for him, but I'm also incredibly jealous. I know I keep saying that but it could've been me with him.",5,1765065383.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.78,False

Am I being too harsh on myself?","I’m a very productive person no matter where I go. Not to brag, but I always deliver the most and best (or at least among the best). However, I realized this actually hurts me because I’m bad at selling myself. For example, if I go to the coffee shop for 8 hours and only did four hours of work, I’d tell others that I didn’t have a productive day. I would feel guilty and genuinely insecure when telling others. They’d see that I’m guilty. It’d make me sound like I’m lazy. 

There are days where me and my coworkers just talk all day or did other things aside from our main project. My coworker would talk about how much we did, and I would get so nervous later. If my boss was to ask me, I’d say I didn’t do much. 

I realized I’m just so bad at the corporate game. Is it because of the way I was raised? I was expected to deliver the best growing up, and I’ve frequently been told by a few people that I’m too harsh on myself sometimes.

I've been a Christian all my life, though I would say I've become more serious about my faith in the past year or two. I attend church weekly, read the bible often, attend two Christian young adult groups, and I'm part of a group that organizes events for Christian men. Now that I've put myself in a place where I can fulfill the role of provider, I'm looking to find a Christian girl that's interested in me.

I'm looking for a woman that's serious about a relationship with God first, and a good man second. I highly prefer someone in my age range (18-21), and have a mild preference for a woman younger than I am. I would prefer someone living either near Saint Louis, or in Southern Illinois. I'm willing to do a long-distance relationship though, as long as I'm able to see you in person at least twice a month, and we can agree about where we would want to end up living. I don't want to have sex before marriage (if that was in question), and I only date with marriage as my ultimate intention.

I'm passionate about coding and development, I like watching movies and shows, and the quickest way to my heart is a good conversation while sharing a meal together. I'm a patient man who does his best to adhere to the biblical examples of masculinity. I'm a hopeless romantic, so I'm big on gestures like opening the car doors for a girl, holding the restaurant door open, the sidewalk rule, and I'm willing to perform more similar small gestures if it's important to you.

To me, the most important traits a woman can have are that she's God-fearing, able to communicate (over communication is a myth!), is willing to work on issues as a team, and is patient with me (because no matter how hard I try, I'm human and have things to learn).

Feel free to DM me if you're able to do those four things, I would love to take you out for coffee or dinner! (or whatever else you would prefer, I'm not picky)",7,1765065275.0,ChristianDating,0,1.0,False

✨✨ More deaths by Pitbulls. 🥺



TULLAHOMA, Tenn. (WKRN) — A 50-year-old man and his 3-month-old granddaughter are dead after a violent dog attack that took place Wednesday afternoon in Tullahoma.

According to 14th Judicial District Attorney General Craig Northcott, the Coffee County Communications Center received a call at approximately 3 p.m. about an “apparent mauling by pit bulls” that occurred in the 900 block of E. Warren Street.

A neighbor, Brian Kirby, said he came home from work and saw a woman in the middle of the street screaming. He immediately sprang into action.

Kirby asked the woman if she needed help, but instead of answering him, he said she ran off toward the back of the house. Moments later, Kirby heard sirens and knew something was horribly wrong.

Officials reported that when law enforcement arrived at the scene, they observed the dogs attacking the infant. The dogs were reportedly killed to stop the attack, but two people—identified as 50-year-old James Alexander Smith and his 3-month-old granddaughter—were already deceased.

While Kirby said this was the first time he’s seen the dogs be violent toward humans, he said it isn’t the first instance of violence he’s seen. 

He said he saw firsthand the dogs were violent toward other animals. Kirby intended to make a police report a week prior, claiming they killed his beloved pet cat.

“I don’t believe that they thought this would ever happen,” Kirby said. “I’m sure it was not done on purpose. I think that people just have animals, and they just need to put them on a leash better; that’s all. And I’m not blaming them for what happened at all. I know that they’re devastated more than we are because it’s their family. It’s just hard to understand and wrap your head around it.”

Kirby brought his pet cat home eight years ago, and she still holds a special place in his heart.

“She was just a wonderful cat,” he said. “She was just an ideal cat, never made a mess; she was just a beautiful animal that I loved very much.”

However, Kirby hopes pet owners know taking care of animals includes loving them and putting them on leashes for safety. In addition, he hopes this situation never happens again.

“The police are limited; they can’t do much about it,” Kirby said. “I don’t believe they thought the dogs were dangerous. I believe they just had too many.”

According to Northcott, an investigation is ongoing to determine if there was a violent history with the dogs and other potential issues that “may have contributed to this situation.” He added that the dogs involved in the deadly attack have been euthanized and other dogs in the home were taken by Tullahoma Animal Control.

No decisions have been made when it come to criminal charges, said Northcott.

“This was an especially difficult and brutal scene,” Northcott stated in a press release about the incident. “Please pray for the family of the victims in this difficult time as well as the first responders as they cope with the trauma from what they witnessed.”

An investigation into the deadly attack is being led by the Tullahoma Police Department. Anyone with additional information is asked to contact Investigator Jessica Taylor at **931-455-0530**, Investigator Jason Williams or Investigator James Sherill with the District Attorneys Office at **931-723-5055**.

Peter lay in bed trying to figure out how it all happened. He knew alcohol had played a part, but not too much; he didn’t have a hangover, and he remembered everything. They had just talked over a meal and watched an old movie. During the movie, she had moved closer, and suddenly... well... he smiled. Now she was in his bed, sleeping. He had to get out of here and think. This was going way too fast for him.  He managed to get out of bed slowly without waking her and headed to the bathroom, got dressed, and took care of the morning routine. When he came out, she was still sleeping, so he made his way out of the room. When he reached the hallway, he went to the mess hall and the kitchen. The ship was quiet, with most rooms dark to save energy. He made himself a cup of coffee and drank it slowly as he thought about everything.

Why would such a beautiful woman fall for a broken, ugly man like him? He and Tina had been friends since childhood, growing up on Runior. She had even laughed at his stupid jokes about calling Runior planet Australia. That farm world had nothing but alien wildlife, half of which wanted to eat you and lots of farms.  He had lost one brother to those beasts, he had three left.  He had told her about using his old shuttle to visit Tina at the spaceport and having to dodge her five brothers. They had both joined the Navy just to get off that damn rock and married more for the security and benefits. If he were honest, then he would guess they would divorce after the service. They had been too young, and it was not like they had much of an option back home.  Now this woman just lands in his lap and claims she has fallen for him. No, she will drop him like an ugly toad the moment they are off this planet. He just had to see this all as fun and not take it too seriously. But damn, she was so… he sighed.  Why did she have to be so damn perfect?

She had told him all about her life, too.  Growing up with just one brother and in a megacity with millions of people, he had a life of luxury he could not have imagined. She had a personal maid droid and many friends. Nightclubs and expensive restaurants with food from all around the known universe. She had even been to Earth on a vacation.   She was just using him, probably thinking she had to do this to make sure he would help her get off this rock. Part of him wanted to play along, part of him felt guilty. Even after all she had said about it being real. He started making breakfast for them, then grabbed a tray and got ready to bring it down when he noticed her in the doorway looking at him and the tray in his hand. She just stared at him, confused.

“Were you going to bring me breakfast in bed?”

“Uh..  well, you were still sleeping.”

“You were going to bring me breakfast in bed? Oh my good… “she came over, took the tray from him, and put it on the table, then kissed him passionately.

“Stop being so damn good.” She whispered, and Peter looked at her, confused.

“You never had breakfast in bed?”

“No.. well, only if I was sick, but that doesn’t count.” She let go of him and smiled. “I'll go back to bed. “ She left with a big grin on her lips, and he looked after her, confused. How could something as simple as that make her so happy? That had to be an act, but he was hungry, so why not play along?ow copulh

Breakfast became lunch, which became dinner, and the next morning he carried her up to the kitchen for breakfast. She had stolen his old shirt and just watched him make their breakfast.  “We have to work today. If we are lucky, then the engine room has cooled down, so we can see just how damage is in there and get the captain out of the freezer. Maybe bury them properly also.”

“Yes, sir!” she said playfully. “But I’m moving into your room.”

“If you want, but I’m thinking about cleaning up the other rooms and moving into the captain's room. It's bigger.”

He put the breakfast on the table and joined her, then looked at the screen and saw several messages from the AI.

“Computer! Show alarms.”

They both looked at the screen and saw several messages of systems being fixed, only to reveal new problems. The list of materials the Nano repair unit demanded was growing, and it had used all of the material in storage.

“We need to start the mining programs. I just hope the mining program we have can be used on those droids.”

“I know how to hack, so let me work on that. I should be able to integrate the.  I wasn’t always going to be a cop, remember.”

“Oh, I remember. Little thief.” He said, remembering how she described her uncle teaching her family trade. It was why the cops had used her as an undercover.  She had the know-how to pass as a criminal.

He looked up at the screen, and his jaw dropped. “What the hell?”

She followed her gaze and saw the images from outside the ice wall, the camp was back. It had grown, and in front of the wall, they had strung up several of their own kind in what appeared to be some sort of ritual sacrifice to them.

Kiko stood up and just stared at the screen, “Oh my god! Are those sacrifices?”

“It appears so,” he counted them. Five of their own were strung up on a rack stand with their guts hanging out, green blood ran freely from the ritual cuts, and the poor bastard seemed to be still alive.

“Computer! How long since they arrived?”

“Twelve hours ago.”

They both looked at each other, she seemed guilty. “I’m sorry.”

“For what? I don’t think we could have stopped it.” He replied, and she looked back at the screen.

“So what do we do now? Look, they are cutting the ice up. I think we just made this place holy for them.”

“Yeah, they probably think there is an ice dragon living here. If we fly off, then they will definitely think this place has ice dragons.”

“We could scare them away?”

“Naw, they would probably think we are not happy with the sacrifice and bring more. “

“Then what? Are they going to raid those pig men and sacrifice them to us? What if we make them lose the raid?” She suggested that she was trying to find a solution, and he looked at her. Did she really care about these aliens, or was it just an act? Part of him was glad she did, at least she wasn’t a psychopath.

“If they fail, then they might think they gave too little or that we are evil and trying to attack us.”

“ozone! We can flood the area with Ozone. They are plant-like, right?”

“What?”

“Well, they can probably breathe oxygen, right. They are, after all, going to raid those pig men, so flooding it with oxygen will not really scare them away. They might even think we are on those pig men's side. So we flood the place with a gas that is harmful to both. They should get the hint of leaving us at peace, then we toss those sacrifices down the hill after them so they see that we didn’t want them.”

“That might actually work, you're pretty smart.” He said, and she smiled.

“I can't believe the farmer boy didn’t think about it.”

“We didn’t use anything on our crops, natural crops, and a bunch of Mictu-kittens to keep the pests away.”

“I can't believe that you actually had a winged cat as a pet and you didn’t bring one along.”

“If we get out of here, I will get you one.”

“Promise?”

“Promise.” He smiled and then turned to the screen. “Computer!  How much ozone gas can we produce?”

The answer came up, but it was not nearly enough of what they needed. He scratched his chin while thinking. It was strange to scratch the beardless chin.

“Computer! What gas can we produce in abundance that would be harmful to the creatures outside the cave?”

The computer recommended Sulfur Dioxide. He looked at Kiko.

“We got a winner. Let's go with this one. We will make this place unlivable for them as well. Hopefully, we will get some peace and quiet.”

She looked at the screen and nodded. “They are so barbaric.”

“Well, they look like they are actually barbarians.” He replied, and she looked at him.

“Still, this is just horrible.  Are we going to chase them off the whole mountain?”

“Do you want them on the mountain?”

“No, not if they do that.”

“Then yeah, we chase them down the other side. I don’t think it would be smart to force them down to the pig guys. They will probably just end up fighting to the death.”

“So, what should we do now?”

“Fix the ship, you said you could help with fixing the droids? We need them to operate the mining machine.”

“Yeah, fix the droids. Why did you guys sell the mining droids you had?”

“The captain needed to pay for his debt.  That’s why we ended up doing more smuggling missions. We were supposed to just mine with this ship, remember?”

“Yeah, and now you know why you should not let the gambling addict be the captain.” She replied as she stood up and stretched. He just looked, and she noticed.

“Down boy!” The outside was forgotten for a moment as he winked at him. “We have to work, remember. To get off the planet.”

“Then stop that.” He replied, and she winked.

“Aya aye, Captain. I will put on something less revealing.” She walked out the door, and he just looked after her. God, she was going to be the death of him. Well, at least he would die with a smile on his lips. He took a deep breath and turned back to the computer.

1pg3g3z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pg3g3z,Namoki to Custom Logo Swap,"I'm quite new to building Seiko mods, which has become a hobby/obsession in my early retirement. I decided I want to build some watches for my siblings for the holidays. I found some ""Fume"" dials I liked on Namoki in various colors (each relevant to a theme for each watch). BUT: I wanted to remove the Namoki logo, and replace it with a custom logo. This post describes some of what I've figured out for myself, about how to do this, in case it helps anyone else who's been having trouble with custom logo work. I'm sure there are many experienced modders here who will think - wow, that's a lot of words for something simple, but maybe there are tidbits here for novices like me.

**Photo 1:** Shows the dial as received from Namoki, with their logo under 12:00.

**Photo 2:** Shows a dial-working ""jig"" (board) that I made. It's a roughly 6"" x 6"" piece of Azek (synthetic trim board) which I happened to have lying around. I took a 28.5mm NH-compatible dial I use for experimenting, tapped the feet (at about 1:30 and 7:30 for NH movements) with a black sharpie, pressed it to the Azek to leave ink impressions, and then drilled hole for the dial feet using the smallest bit I happen to have (1/32"", I think). That lets me place the dial flat and relatively stable, rotationally, on the Azek. I use delicate-surface painter's masking tape to hold the dial down more firmly. But, after numerous tries at placing custom logos (which I order from 4customize - great service from them!), I realized that just trying to place the logo by sight alone led it to be in the wrong location and/or not horizontal (text running parallel to the 9:00/3:00 horizontal diameter of the dial). So, I bought some 1mm graph paper, cut it into 10mm x 10mm squares, and marked the Azek board at the center of each side, to make it easy to place each new sheet. Getting those center marks took a few iterations, but now I can tape down a sheet of the graph paper, and know that the dial foot hole near 1:30 on the dial will be at X=9.5mm Y=8.5mm (and, negative values for the other foot). I then use, of all things, a spare temporary watch stem (blue plastic 'crown') to poke through the paper into the drilled holes in the Azek. I can then place the dial, and the holes are just big enough to allow me to sllde the dial until it's perfectly registered with the graph paper.

**Photo 3:** I've read numerous posts about using a hair dryer to soften up the adhesive on a logo to make it easier to remove, and thought: wow, a hair dryer is a serious blunt instrument for that task. So, I found an inexpensive (\~$30 USD) heat gun intended for electronic repair work - it comes with very narrow nozzles, and good digital control of both air temperature and speed. It's fantastic. I set it for 250F, lowest air speed, hold the tiny nozzle right on the logo to be removed, and use a wood pick to nudge the logo pieces until I can safely grab them with Rodico or a tweezer without scratching the dial. The heat gun I purchased has a quirk: every time I start it up from cold, it flashes an LED code indicating that it's suffered an irreparable fault and needs to be replaced. But, if I turn it off and on again, and it now starts heating to the target temperature from more like 150F than ambient temperature, it works fine.

**Photo 4:** This shows what the dial looked like after heating the logo adhesive and removing the 3 pieces of the Namoki logo (2 dots and a bar). There's residual adhesive left. I've read posts where people suggest just leaving it, as the new logo will cover it up, but that sounds like a highly imperfect approach. The first thing I tried was using 91% alcohol, as I've read that people use that to clean logos. That's worked for me beautifully on some other non-Namoki dials, but Namoki seems to order dials with alcohol-soluble clearcoat over alcohol-soluble dial paint, so my initial attempts at cleaning the adhesive resulted in my mangling the dial.

**Photo 5:** Today, I had an 'aha!' moment. We'd just gotten our holiday tree, and I ended up with tree sap on my hands. I used some Goo Gone to remove the sap, and then thought: maybe Goo Gone will remove logo adhesive without eating the dial clearcoat and paint. So, I squirted some Goo Gone into a paper towel, then rolled a swab into that to get just a tiny amount on the swab, and ... it worked. It cleaned up the adhesive, without dissolving the clearcoat. I then mixed a couple drops of dishwashing liquid and small amount of water in a dish, dipped the swab in that, and washed off the Goo Gone residue. I then dried it with a microfiber cloth. Photo 5 shows the result - not bad, and ready for the custom logo.

**Photo 6:** I didn't take a photo of this, but when I've tried placing 4customize logos, I've found it tricky to get the logo into the right spot before applying pressure to the logo to get it to adhere to the dial. So, I used some contact cement, used a toothpick to tab some onto the ends of the logo top layer (which is removed after the logo is pressed on), dabbed some on to the ends of a bamboo coffee stirring rod I broke in half (same width as the logo paper), waited 10 minutes, and then attached the bamboo sticks to the logo top sheet. That allowed me to pull the logo sheet taut, and see what I was doing (using a 5x or 10x loupe) as I moved it into position before pressing it down. Also, I used masking tape to create the horizontal line along which to place it, and I made a small pencil mark at the center (along the line from 12:00 to 6:00. This let me get it placed reasonably well. You can also see in this photo where I affixed a logo to the graph paper above the dial, so that I knew which part of the logo should be at the center line.

**Photo 7:** Once I'm done building the watch (I'm using an Alpinist-inspired case from Namoki), I'll post it, but this shows the dial (not yet with hands) in the case. The close-up photo shows some dust, which is on a combination of the top of the crystal, the inside of the crystal, and maybe the dial, though I cleaned up the dial quite thoroughly with Rodico before placing the case. I wasn't that worried about thoroughly cleaning the crystal, as this was just a temporary casing to see how things looked, before I get to work on the hands, sizing the steam, and installing the caseback with gasket. That said: I do find that I constantly end up with some dust visible once I think I'm ""done"" assembling a watch, and need to work on my dust control and interior crystal prep to get a more-perfect result once ""done"". As I said: I'm a novice.",4,1765064274.0,SeikoMods,1,0.84,False

1pg3esk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pg3esk,If whiskey was wine,"One of the reasons I grew corn this year in some contractor buckets on my porch.  Made from like 30ish percent roast, dried then frozen house hybrid corns bred from a mix of Martian jewel red purple stalk corn, Japanese sticky extra glutinous black corn and some super sweet white.  The flavor averages were like sweet corn with a stronger corn flavor and some warm nutty notes.

A pound of knotweed honey which has a distinct botanical flavor.

And pound and half of roasted dates.

The idea in my head was make something that tastes like whiskey minus any of the oak notes.  Not that I have issues with oak.  Like it as a flavoring.  Just wanted to see if I could do it.

It’s strong.  Very strong.  Fermented for four or five weeks.  Kind of oily mouth feel.  Warm and sour corn notes are front.  Shifting into the amber notes of the dates and ending with hint of the weird botanical almost molasses like flavor from the knotweed honey.

Is so dry!

Ugh I need to get some food in my stomach before I finish this.  Is not distilled.  But I’d like to think I was getting close to maxing the champagne and turbo rum makers yeasts with this one.

Fancier tasting than expected.

That sounds dramatic, I know. At the time it just looked like a celebration. There were white tablecloths, and little silver stands with place cards, people in clothes that cost more than your car, and waiters drifting in and out with trays of food I could not pronounce. All of it for me. For Jenna, the golden girl.

I had just come from the state track championship, my spikes still in the bag in the front hall. I won that trophy. I had also graduated at the top of my class. There was an acceptance letter from an Ivy League school in a folder upstairs, along with a swimming scholarship. On paper, my life looked perfect, and I believed it was all mine. My hard work, my muscles, my brains.

So, when my dad raised his glass that night and said my name in that booming voice of his, I smiled like I meant it, and tried not to think about how cold the big dining room always felt once the guests had gone.

And they were gone early that night. By nine the dishes were gone, the lights turned down, and it was just the three of us at the long table, napkins crumpled in front of us, the centerpiece flowers leaning like they were tired. My dad tapped his fork against his glass and cleared his throat.

“Jenna, how do you think we’ve risen to this lifestyle?” He gestured grandly, the way he always did when he talked about money. His gesture included the chandeliers, the paintings, the whole big echoey house. I saw our reflection in the window behind him. Three people who looked like a family from a catalog.

""I don’t know, hard work and good connections.”

My mom made a little sound, almost a laugh but not quite. She looked down at her plate, tracing the rim with one finger.

She said, “there certainly has been some of that, but how much actual “hard work” have you seen your father devote to anything?” Her voice had an edge I did not recognize. My father looked up, trying to make eye contact with her, lips pressed flat against his teeth.

She went on, still talking to her plate. “The fact is, he doesn’t have to.”

I waited for the punchline but Mom does not joke.

My fork suddenly seemed too loud against the china. Dad stared straight ahead for a moment, then turned his head toward me like it hurt to do it.

“Jenna"", he said, looking at me like he was staring into my soul, ""your great grandfather made a bargain with a…dealer, where we would get good luck and fortune for a negligible price for a lifetime. And that includes our children up to the time they are 18 and leave the house. Before they leave, the child, you, must also make a choice. Will you accept the bargain and take the path to great fortune, or decline it, and lose that link to continued wealth for you and the whole family.”

If he had told me he was actually a lizard in a rubber suit it would have felt more believable.

I looked from him to my mom. She still would not meet my eyes. My heart did that thing it does right before the starter gun goes off. It is not fear, not exactly. It is a feeling like the world has narrowed to a single thin line, and if you slip off, you are gone.

“What do we bring to the table to get this bargain?” I asked.

“It will all be explained by the Dealer,” said dad. He checked his watch like he was waiting for a conference call.

My mom finally looked up, but not at me. She stared past my shoulder toward the hall.

“He is waiting for you in the study now” she said. There was awe in her voice, and dread.

I pushed back from the table so fast my chair scraped across the floor. No one scolded me for the noise. That scared me more than anything they had said so far.

I walked down the hallway, the soles of my sandals whispering over the polished wood. Every family photo seemed to watch me. My fifth grade picture where I had new braces and too big glasses. My eighth grade swim team shot, my shoulders already broad, the coach standing behind me with his hand on my back like he had discovered gold.

At the end of the hall were the double doors to the study, dark wood. I put my hand on one of the brass handles and hesitated.

I could have walked out the front door, I guess. Called a friend, called a cab, called anyone. But that was not how this worked. In our house you did what Dad said, and you did it well.

I opened the doors.

I had expected a shadow in the corner, something out of a horror movie. What I saw instead was a mild looking man sitting behind the desk in the full light of the room. He wore a cardigan and jeans, dark hair combed neatly, maybe late twenties. There was a ceramic mug on the coaster beside him, steam curling up from it. He looked like a grad student on break.

He looked up, smiled, and said, “I’m sure your parents told you the little secret to their success, and what’s at stake if you go rogue, so should we get on with it then?”

“Wait, what, who are you, what do I have to do…” I heard my voice shaking and hated it.

The Dealer cut me off. The smile slipped from his face like it had never been there. His voice turned sharp.

“I don’t have the time or inclination to allow this to drag on. If you agree with the deal, things go on as they have been. You will excel as you have up until now. Life will be easy; you will have success in every endeavor. Come here and sign on this line and you live a dream life. If you refuse, you won’t, simple as that. You will have an unlucky life. Everything your parents built will come crashing down. I don’t know how someone in your position could even hesitate. Stop making this take so long and sign.”

The air in the room thickened. It felt like someone had turned off the oxygen. The man on the chair was not mild anymore. He was the same height, the same body, but his posture changed. It signaled that he could be on me faster than I could reach the door. His hair looked a little messier, his eyes a little brighter. Older, somehow. Hungrier.

“I’m waiting” he said.

My legs refused to work, like they knew something I did not. I stood there, breathing like I had just finished the four hundred meter dash.

“What are you doing, get up there and sign” my mother hissed.

But she was not in the room. I realized the study doors were not quite closed and her face was framed between them, one eye and half her mouth, both twisted with fury. She looked like a more terrifying version of herself.

That look finally shoved me forward.

Mom had spent my whole life asking for more. More medals, more points, more A grades. I felt like I never satisfied her. I needed to try.

I walked up to the desk.

The Dealer stood up. He was taller than I thought. He smelled of expensive cologne, the kind some of the men at the country club wore, but there was a hint of something rotten under it. His skin was perfect; eyes a weird gold color that made me think of old coins. Once my eyes met his it was almost impossible to look away.

On the desk was a long legal looking document with the typical yellow “sign here” tab stuck near the bottom. Beside it lay a heavy black and red fountain pen and a small glass dish.

“Give me your hand” the Dealer said.

His voice had gone flat, businesslike.

“Why?” I asked, though I already knew.

The pieces clicked together in my mind, memory of dark old stories my grandmother used to tell when she had too much wine.

“Don’t be a baby, let’s get this done, yes, it has to be signed in blood, big deal,” he said.

I should have run. I should have screamed. I should have done a hundred things besides what I did, which was to freeze again, sweat profusely, with a dry mouth.

The Dealer did not wait. He grabbed my right hand, his hands like iron, and in one smooth practiced motion he stabbed my index finger, hard, with the fountain pen.

The pain was sharp and immediate. Blood welled up and he turned my hand so it flowed into the glass dish. The moment the blood touched the glass it turned black and bubbled slightly. Not dark red, not maroon. Black, like oil boiling in slow motion.

Something roared in my ears. I could barely hear him when he dipped the pen into the dish, then pushed it into my hand.

“Just sign here and you and your parents will be happy for the rest of your life, do it now.”

I knew he was telling the truth. That was the worst part. I could feel the promise in his voice. Easy days, effortless wins, the same invisible hands that had been carrying me all along.

“Hurry up and sign” he shouted.

The roar in my ears was building to the level of a hurricane.

“Just do it.”

My arm rose on its own, like someone was pulling it up by the elbow. The pen felt heavy in my fingers, the nib already wet. Somewhere under the noise a tiny part of me thought about the word “lifetime”. Then I thought about my future kids, faces I could not see yet, and a cold little voice inside said, “What about the price”.

With a scream I did the only thing I could think of. Using every bit of strength I had gained from every sprint, every weight lifted, every lap swum, I used that power to bring the pen down as hard as I could on the back of his hand that was holding the edge of the contract.

The pen sank in like it was going into soft clay.

The Dealer made a sound that was not human. The lights flickered. The air seemed to tear. His blood erupted from the wound and hit my face. It was hot and smelled like something from the bottom of a swamp. His eyes went wide and then wider, the gold burning into something so bright I had to look away.

I heard footsteps behind me, my mother screaming, my father shouting something I did not catch.

The room spun, then stretched, then snapped back.

When I opened my eyes, I was on the floor.

The dealer was gone. The only sign he had been there was a light scorch mark on the carpet behind the desk.

My finger was still bleeding.

From the hall I heard my mother sob, “What have you done, what have you done,” over and over. My father said nothing at all.

People think curses are fireworks. Big, loud, obvious. My curse turned out to be more like a slow leak in a tire.

Things did not explode. There was no lightning bolt, no swarm of insects, no demon leaping out of the ceiling vent. The Dealer vanished, that was all. One second he was there, making that awful sound, and the next there was empty air and the smell of burned matches.

My parents did not comfort me.

“You stupid girl,” my mother whispered. “Do you have any idea what you have done to us?”

I wanted to tell her I had done it for my own future kids, for a life that was mine, for a choice that was not made with a pen full of someone else's blood. But I just held my bleeding finger against my dress and stared at the mark on the carpet where the Dealer had been.

Nothing looked any different.

The next morning my dad’s car would not start. It was a small thing, but the way he looked at me when he came back into the kitchen made me go cold inside.

Dad’s big investment went sideways a month later. Some tech company that had looked like a sure bet evaporated overnight, taking most of his liquid cash with it. I heard him yelling about it from my room.

The future narrowed.

For me, no Olympic trials, no glossy magazine covers. No corporate headhunters courting me at fancy dinners. Just a stack of applications and a quiet little job at a not for profit corporation that helped kids in rough neighborhoods find safe places to be after school.

The pay was not great. The work was hard. I came home tired in a way I had not known before, bone deep, with a head full of other people's trouble. But when I lie down at night, I felt something I had never felt in that big cold house growing up.

I felt like the day had been mine.

My parents did not attend my college graduation. By then Dad was busy with lawyers. The embezzlement charges had taken shape, then solidified, then locked around his ankles. His talent for getting away with things had run out. Turned out when luck leaks out of your life, auditors can see everything you thought you had buried.

Mom had moved to a small townhouse across town after the divorce. She worked part time at a boutique and told anyone who would listen that her husband had ruined her. She did not mention the deal her grandfather had made, or the one I refused.

When I visited, which was not often, she looked at my clothes, my hair, my tired face, and sighed. “You could have had so much more,” she said once, standing in the narrow kitchen making coffee that came from a can instead of using a gleaming machine the size of a microwave.

But the good things came on their own too. They felt different. They felt earned.

One of those good things was my daughter. She was smart, but it did not come as easily. She had to study. She had to practice. She did not coast through races on legs that never seemed to tire. She tried out for track and made the team, but she was always in the middle of the pack, never at the front.

Her eighteenth birthday came and went. We had a cake, a pile of modest presents, some handmade cards from the kids in my program who adored her from the days she volunteered there. No men in cardigans appeared in the living room.

Maybe the world was fair after all.

A month after her birthday, and two weeks before leaving for college, Lily came in from the porch holding a small cardboard box. The mail had already arrived that day. But this box must have been dropped off later, maybe by a courier. There was no return address, just her name written in black ink on the top.

Inside, was a fountain pen. Heavy, black and red. The sight of it made me feel the terrible stab into my finger, the way my blood had turned to thick black ink when it touched the glass.

There was a note folded beside it.

“Mom?” I heard Lily say. “You okay? You look like you just saw a ghost.”

The paper was the same cream color as the contract I had refused to sign. The writing on it was neat and precise. Not my father's. Not my mother's. Not anyone I knew.

The note said only,

“See you soon.”",10,1765063854.0,nosleep,6,0.86,False

Had to go into the store to set it up.

My son's cellular Apple Watch is a ""family watch"" configured with my own phone (which uses a carrier that has no Apple Watch support what-so-ever).

They needed my ID and the Watch's IMEI.

No SIM was ever stuck in my own iPhone, no eSIM was ever installed on my own iPhone.

To any Americans reading this and spitting out your coffee upon hearing $15/month... all the Apple Watch plans here are $10/month (share a number) or $15 (independent number from phone).

At least this approach doesn't need a mobile plan with one of our more expensive carriers on top of that. I believe ONLY Bell offers this right now.

I've seen some Reddit posts a few months old saying Bell requires a mobile line as well... I think that's now out-of-date information.

Before trying this with Bell, I did buy some travel eSIMs (GlobalYO, Freedom) because just about every travel eSIM company has some possibly LLM generated blog post about how to set up an Apple Watch. (They all read the same.) But none of those eSIMs actually support Apple Watch. You can pump in your watch's IMEI and check it against the eSIM company and it will say your IMEI is fine... but there's no way to activate the watch with it. (Least they are cheap to try, and learn this.)

Only ""MobilityPass"" (travel eSIM) specifically claims to support Apple Watch cellular, but they look way too sketchy. Their unusual choices for payment might be to avoid credit card ease of reversing a charge.  
  
It seems like it could be cheaper to get a 180-day travel eSIM, so if anyone's ever figured how to get one of those to work with an Apple Watch... that would be at least interesting.",4,1765063812.0,AppleWatch,0,1.0,False

I was kinda depressed since after middle school most of my companions went to other Highschools, so for the first couple of days I was kinda alone.

Luckily I met Matthew and we hit it off pretty quickly. It helped that we had a lot of interests, including Chess and Video games. We especially started bringing and playing our 3ds during recess. Eventually I introduced him to some of my friends and he introduced me to his, and we all started hanging out together and just playing smash bros. 

We hung out until we graduated Highschool, and he told us that he would be going to the Marines. I was sad but told him good luck. 

Years passed and its now 2025 and he finished his contract with the Marines, and found out that he moved back here. I wanted to reach out but was hesitant, I didn't want it to look weird. Eventually recently I got the courage to contact him, and to my surprise he actually texted back.

I texted him one morning, and almost had a heart attack when he responded and even told me if I wanted to have coffee with him in a café. I of course said yes, and soon we met up. We talked for a while, and we just began catching up on whats been happening. One question that stood out was he asked me why I reached out, and I of course I played it cool and told him it was just to reconnect.

Later that day we decided to reach out to a couple of buddies, and we went to a restaurant. We soon made a plan to hang out at an arcade place later that month. Overall good times.

However, at the end of the arcade I had one of my panic attacks before driving them. I was the driver since I was the only one with a car lol. They noticed something was wrong but I played it off. Eventually I drove my friends to there houses, and Matt was the last person I dropped off. Before he got out, he told me to be careful while driving since it was dark and told me to text him when I got home safely. Once I got home I texted him and he was relieved.

We Eventually were going to do another hangout last month, but everyone had last minute plans and also money was tight for a couple of us. 

Part of me wants to do another hangout with him and tell him how I feel. I know it probably wouldn't go well since he already told me he had sex with a girl when he was at the marines so I know hes most likely just straight.",1,1765063686.0,AskBiBros,0,1.0,False

And what I thought was SOUP might not be.

About filters. I have both metal and mesh filter for AP, 2 each.

Been using a metal above (without it the water will carve a hole) I heard about using paper sandwich, but why waste paper when metal will do the same?

This also helps with the distribution and tampering. If I mess up, it will be apparent because I'll open and it will be tilted, if I do everything correctly, it stays flat.

For below, I'll use 2x mesh and a metal, it's enough to clean the coffee of fines and well... I like it. Sometimes I'll throw a paper one for some coffees that would be better with more clarity.

My recipe is: 1/10. been doing 15 gr to 150ml of boiling water (or 20gr/200ml if it will be the only cup that day). Pump until first drops, wait a few seconds and then start pumping really slow (palms up, extended arm, let arm weight do the job) then I might bypass with 30\~50ml depending on the coffee and whatever my taste that day is.

It's a clarity from v60 I like (especially when I add the paper filter), but packing more of a punch and all done and cleaned in less than 7 minutes, then I'm off to enjoy my coffee. 

I'm using a blade R3, around 800μm at aorund 1+10.0 [https://honestcoffeeguide.com/mhw-3bomber-blade-r3-grind-settings/](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/mhw-3bomber-blade-r3-grind-settings/) maybe too coarse? I've tried with finer, but it was clogging hard. Maybe with the recipe from what I'm getting from skimming the posts... more infusion time would let me use a finer grind. R3 also makes too much fines (it is its profile), so I started playing with other burrs that change this.



Next... should probably revisit the official suggested recipe and longer infusion times. What would you say is ""the"" recipe to try?",5,1765063041.0,OXORapidBrewer,1,1.0,False

But it's odd. 

There's no how are yous or shall I come over, it is still very much miss you both haven't seen you both in a while, manipulation. I have batted back nicely like sure please text your son as I don't know his shifts and plans off the top of my head. And she still comes back to me. She's said hurtful horrible things to me and about me in the past, she hasn't included me , or made me feel welcome up here , not that it was ever her responsibility too, but she can't expect me to behave like a willing lapdog when I haven't been loved like one ... 

Yesterday I have a text message at 11am saying hello we are all at (her daughter's) now, would I like to pop round for a coffee. Well no? I just feel like an after thought. The woman never comes to our house even though it is a few streets away from the daughter. We always have to go to the mil. Everytime. She never makes a plan or actually wants to see me. She has actively ignored my calls and efforts ,and now suddenly because it's December I feel she's being all Christmassy. I used to be desperate for company and attention as my partner works odd shifts, and yesterday I thought no, I actually dont want to go. So I just replied I wasn't feeling good and won't be able to make it. No reply , nothing off her. I'm on some heavy pain medication and tidy she caught me on a short walk this morning ( driving through my street but yet finds it impossible to ever come here for some reason ) and pulled over to speak to me. I looked for a better word , like I crawled out of a grave. Because that's how I feel , no absolute concern at all for me, no asking how I am or are you ok? Just she's making a dinner tomorrow would me and her son like one as she's sure he'd like one so I say yes, I'm done in, and I cannot be bothered with saying no. She says she will drop it round ( she does this , never drops it round and phones complaining that he has to pick them up , even when he has said no to wanting anything she cooks it and then demands it to be collected). 

I feel ungrateful, but I've had years of this. Absolutey nothing from her for almost a year, she stopped answering my calls and texts, id go round for tea on my own or for coffee sometimes when my partner was nights. But she just stopped answering me one day. I tried for months ,probably rang her once a week then once every two weeks. She did say something when we went to bingo once that her daughter was jealous. I just can't ever imagine my mum doing that to my sister in-law of I said I was jealous. 

It's hurt me, and I can't take this confusion. I also don't want to just slot back in her life because she now decides.

For those interested, here is my worst experience when it comes to ""Emergency Response: Liberty County""...

I've always been a huge fan of mafias and organised crime and I decided to make a special group tailored around a mafia theme — however it would focus on realism and accuracy to a real world criminal empire.

All was going well until I happened to come across the co-owner of a ""New York"" server. He just so happened to operate a group of his own called ""Rebellion""... they were one of those groups that claimed a mafia title but didn't act like one in the slightest. 

Issues truly began when I claimed ""territory"" for my group to help us keep up with the realism. I believe we used a coffee shop as a way to launder money, if memory is correct. 

The ""Rebellion"" group would actively come to our store and RDM. They would also metagame (the act of using outside information for an in game benefit) by somehow discovering that the coffee shop was a money laundering operation without any proof.

Things only escalated. Fights became more common, reports continued to be made until the owner told me to just ""give him"" the coffee shop so he'd stop complaining.

1pg2tuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pg2tuq/anomaly_2006_part_7/,Anomaly #2006: Part 7," 	Sorry about the sudden ending, I wanted to get far away from that anomaly before even touching Nicolas’s documents. The way the crow watched from above, the feeling of #2006 watch me. I’m curious if it knows, I want to say it can’t be that intelligent. Though I’ve been wrong about it many times.

As I grab the binder from the ruffled black backpack. I feel a weight that I can only describe as a full milk jug. I thought I knew a lot about the anomaly, Nicolas had notes that could almost rival The Bible. Propping my feet up I open the binder, with a steady finger that glides through words, I read carefully. There’s a lot of information here I already know, or at least theorized. “#2006 sat in the corner of the room, disguising itself as a black lab. Its tail wagged in an abnormal manner, up and down diagonally, slowly. The barks were distorted as it would try to find the right pitch. We sent in a little rat, observing how the anomaly would react…” flipping the page I breathed loosely, envisioning what horrors that anomaly will take hold of. “Near instantly the anomaly shrunk down in size, its fur turned tan and slimmed itself. Narrowing its snout, it became a near perfect Coyote. We expected as much, but what we didn’t expect was a strong scent to flourish out the room. We usually keep the containment rooms scentless, so the smell of peppermint oil fuming out was surely a surprise. The rat began to scatter, fumbling about as its instincts drove #2006 to rush with abhorrent speed.” I’ve had the theory that the anomaly gained strength through fear after watching Nicolas’s death. The way the tallon effortlessly broke open the door, it couldn’t have been normal.   
  
  
  
Imagine fishing in a pond, trying to catch a small fish, let's use perch for example. You hook a large fish onto the end of the line for bait, say a bass. When the perch sees bass, the perch would of course swim away as quickly as possible. Which causes the bass to gain its strength back and swim after the perch. If my theory is correct, the anomaly works on some warped version of logic. Also that’s not an effective way to catch fish. I flip my way through the notes until I get to the next section. The van's awful A/C blows roughly on my face as I read.  
  
  
  
“We aren’t aware of where #2006 came from. I heard from the rescue team that it was found during a search for #303, the skinned bear. During the operation in the woodlands of Alaska, the team thought they found the anomaly when- well- a skinned bear walked up to them. Our team didn’t scare easily, I think that’s why we were able to capture it. We only realized our mistake when we came back the next day to find a grasshopper alone in the containment room.” I take my notes and glance back at the binder. The page ends and I lean back in my chair. I know that #2006 has some form of bad reaction to liquid, so I’m certain it didn’t come from the sea. If the Chernobyl disaster was the big bang for these anomalies,  maybe airborne? Maybe it was formed underground and that’s why it gained sensitivity to liquids. I’m still unsure how that works. My hands brush through my buzzcut hair as I try to work out any resemblance of common sense in this anomaly.   
  
  
  
The next section reads as follows: “We’ve been trying to find some breaking point in #2006. Our members have tried playing the ‘I am not scared of you” movie trope, it remained stable. We tried funneling into the containment room with giant shields, overwhelming it didn’t work. Electricity? stable. Gunshots? Hurt, but stable. Stabbing? stable. We could hurt it, but nothing seemed to really affect it. Felt like we were in an endless game of High Stricker, never able to ding the bell. That was, until one lonely night. It was really late and I was just monitoring the anomaly. From what I heard, there was a malfunction in the coffee machine in the lounge. A spark sprouted from inside the outlet, somehow escaped and caught fire in between the walls. The fire was small but it set off our sprinklers, and by some good fortune, it was right under a hose. This sent hot water spraying through the building, the painful sounds of anomalies were heard echoing throughout the facility. #2006 had a strange reaction. It started shifting at speeds so fast my eyes couldn’t keep up. Contorting and forming its body flipping through shapes to find something to protect itself. Its scream was like a high pitched boat horn that rang out, silencing all other anomalies. Bears claws, cat paws, human fists, spider legs. It used everything to bash the walls in hopes of any escape. It ripped at its changing flesh as the water splashed onto it, its scream never changing in pitch or volume. When the sprinklers finally cut off, it stayed screaming. It screamed for hours, banging its head against the wall. It had finally calmed down when the sun rose. I tried to report my findings to the higher ups, but they said they splashed it with a bucket of water and it had no resemblance of a reaction. Stable.”   
  
  
  
I feel like I can confidently confirm, it has something to do with temperature. Though electricity definitely produces enough heat, but it was stable? Honestly at this point, it's a shapeshifting monster that feeds off fear. I’m not going to question it anymore. I skimmed through pages and pages. Either information I already knew or interactions that weren’t important. I was darting through one page when my eyes pulled me forward. I didn’t know why, but I was looking at a name I had grown to know. A character that fueled my drive for completing the research on #2006. I couldn’t hold myself back from reading it aloud.

WHALLEY THE WHITE TAILED DEER.

It’s strange to say, but I was more confused than ever. This stupid cartoon that I watched for fun facts about nature, Nicolas watched it as well? I got the tapes from an old lady at a yard sale for 50 cents a pop! I continued reading when my brain started connecting every dot with a red string. “It’s weird, I know. But I’ve been having increasing anxiety that this thing will escape. I’m making this cartoon by myself so I can show it to Tiffany, hopefully so it’s easier for her to understand it. How else am I supposed to describe that thing to her, my poor Tiffany.” My God. Nicolas made Whalley, Whalley is teaching about #2006. The root episode was made because Nicolas thinks the anomaly came from underground! The anomaly must work on some weird version of metamorphosis! Using its own camouflage to lure its prey, hiding behind a facade of prey or predator! Using fear as a means of energy because… the root of prey is fear. The way that prey survive is through the emotion of fear. The anomaly must be weaponizing this instinctual feeling because how do you fight that? How do you fight fear based on instinct? You can’t, you won’t.   
  
  
  
For once in this loophole of death and horror, I understand! I get how this thing works and how to defeat it! God I need a fucking cigarette or something before I lose it! I need to write this down, I need to write all of this down again so I don’t forget it. I need to remember, I need to understand, I need to kill this damn thing!",2,1765062613.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

We’re going to walk around and look at Christmas lights and I’d love to have a yummy warm beverage to sip on. My husband loves hot chocolate, but I’m a weirdo and don’t like chocolate, and don’t want to do coffee at night. Starbucks was always my fallback with their hot caramel apple cider, but they discontinued it.  :( 

I appreciate all suggestions, and bonus points for additional suggestions of good neighborhoods for lights. Thanks!",4,1765062520.0,ColoradoSprings,3,0.7,False

JJ bean coffee - here's where all the coffee needs hangout

Starbies - people just come here to flex the starbies cards and pay lot more for regular stuff because of ""the logo""

Timmies - lineups are comparable to R4 during semester start

Loafe - here is where all the profs and upper class ppl  hangout and yap about the new research or startups.

Perugia - only life sciences people know about this and this is where they go for post lab meeting relaxation 

edit forgot to add agora and sprouts

Agora -  only FNH students are allowed here 

Sprouts - free food yay !!

These are just my opinions and I have never had coffee at these places. I never have coffee I just pass by these places often and these are the vibes they give off.
