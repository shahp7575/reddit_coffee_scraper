1o04vi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1o04vi2/i_was_bitten_by_a_stray_cat_doc_said_i_dont_need/,I was bitten by a stray cat + doc said I don't need rabies vax. Should I request it anyways?,"While driving through South Carolina, I, 22F, stopped to buy coffee + ended up helping to feed a stray kitten that a few employees had found outside of a local Target... The little cat was so cute, but seemed a bit scared of humans. 

I was feeding her from a container of cat food in my hand, and one of the Target employees nearby grabbed the kitten from behind. The group had been trying to capture her, to take her to the vet for vaccines + domestication. 

After they grabbed the kitten, the little thing really freaked out + started biting/ clawing. I (very stupidly) reached over to try to help, and was also bitten/ scratched. The bites were to my right hand + they were pretty bad. 

The kitten looked healthy and was not aggressive until the employee tried to grab her... After the whole ordeal, the cat ran off... never to be seen again. 

I immediately washed the bites with soap + water, then sprayed the injury with what I think was antibacterial spray, applied neosporin, + bandaged it up. 

Then I drove myself to urgent care, where the nurse prescribed antibiotics. She told me that she didn't think I needed any rabies vaccinations. 

I took my first antibiotic pill about 3 hours after I was bitten. 

Later that night, after texting my primary care doctor + falling down the google rabbit hole, I went to the ER to receive more feedback. My primary care doctor sent me the Rabies decision tree, which recommended that I receive the PEP treatment... 

But at the ER, the doctor who saw me agreed with the nurse from urgent care, and said he didn't think I needed the rabies vaccinations. 

Honestly, I think I'll be fine, but I'd be lying through my teeth if I wasn't concerned about the risk of rabies. It's such a severe illness... + Once symptoms arise, there's no chance of survival. 

I have over 8 small puncture wounds from the bites... I'm worried, but the stray kitten did not seem sick at all, and I am taking good care of the injuries. 

Some info about me: Healthy, 22 year old female. 5'5"", 115lbs. No chronic health issues. Allergic to tree nuts. Takes multivitamin. 

Anyways, doctors of Reddit... What do you all think? Am I going to be ok? I'm a little scared.

When I joined, I was extremely nervous because I didn’t know much about the industry and felt totally out of my depth. Kept quiet in meetings and conversations, thinking it was better to stay silent than say something wrong. But over time, I’ve found that my silence has kind of become a pattern, and now, I feel like I've lost my voice entirely.

The thing is, I’m now the last person anyone listens to when I speak in meetings/lunch banters/coffee catch ups etc. In fact, most of what I say just gets lost in the noise. It’s a bit worse outside of formal work settings too; whenever there are lunch breaks or coffee chats, I try to join in, but when I start speaking, the conversation feels one sided and I feel no one likes to engage with me. To be precise, no one counters or follows up on anything I say, even if I try to add to the banter. I’m also not invited to any team lunches or coffee breaks, and I’ve become pretty much a loner at this point.

What’s even more frustrating is that, despite me trying to network and connect with them, I’m constantly shot down. I feel like my timid mannerisms (which I’m sure are a result of my anxiety) have formed a kind of image of me that people just seem to stick with. I get the sense that no one wants to invest in a conversation with me because they already think they know who I am: quiet, shy, and awkward.

This has created a situation where I’m constantly nervous at work, especially when I need to discuss something critical or make a point in a meeting. I’ve tried speaking up, but it always feels like I’m either ignored or shut down right away. I often just keep to myself, which only reinforces the cycle.

This is not who I want to be. I’m naturally an extrovert and I know I can contribute to the team, but I’m stuck in this cycle of feeling invisible. I really want to change this dynamic, but I’m not sure how to break out of this shell.

Has anyone been through something similar? How can I start being more visible at work and rebuild my confidence? I’d appreciate any advice or strategies you have for getting noticed and overcoming this self-doubt!",0,1759810098.0,AskHR,0,0.5,False

**Title:** Did You Adopt ""Julian"" from ASAP Rescue on Penn Avenue in 2019?

I know this is a long shot but in the words of Wayne Gretzky, ""You Miss 100% of The Shots You Don't Take"". I've literally wanted to make this post for years and couldn't bring myself to do so until now.

I'll explain the story behind my question. In April 2019, my mom and I were visiting Western Pennsylvania from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. We booked a motel in Canonsburg as it was a nice halfway point between 2 places we'd be spending time. The only international trip I ever got to take with my late grandmother was to Wheeling Island in West Virginia so my mom and I were going to go watch the greyhound races.

The primary reason for the trip was to see Cher perform at PPG Paints Arena and to check another MLB stadium off our list (my mom was a HUGE Toronto Blue Jays fan and she raised me to be one as well). About 12 hours after arriving in Canonsburg, my mom went into cardiac arrest and never woke up again. After she was stabilized at Canonsburg Hospital, she was transferred to West Penn Hospital where she died in the ICU a few days later on Easter Sunday.

While my mom was in the ICU, the staff asked me what I needed and I said, ""A dog"". They didn't have emotional support animals who came to the hospital. The hospital made some calls to other local medical facilities and were unsuccessful.

I went on Google and did my own research. The first animal shelter I called said they were too busy to accommodate me. I called ASAP Rescue inside Petland on Penn Avenue (which is a 10-minute drive from West Penn), I explained my situation and they told me I could come over and spend as much time as I wanted.

When I got to ASAP, they asked me which dog I wanted to hang with and I said, ""I'm going to have to play God when I remove my mom from life-support in a couple of days. I don't want to choose which of your dogs gets my love."" They brought out Julian for me who I believe was 5-months old at the time and is half boxer-half pit bull. I spent about 4 hours with him on Good Friday 2019 and another couple of hours on Easter Monday 2019 while my mom was being cremated.

I would have loved to adopt Julian but it would have been too overwhelming with the pending loss of my mom. Not to mention, bringing a dog across the international border would have required some special paperwork.

It's been 6.5 years since I got to hang with Julian during the worst week of my life. I never would have imagined that when I crossed the border into the U.S. with my mom in the passenger seat, that a week later I'd be crossing back into Canada with the urn containing her ashes on the passenger seat.

With the Blue Jays headed to the post-season (sorry Pirates fans), my grief is really strong again as I wish my mom was physically here to see it. I can hear her clapping and cheering and truthfully I've felt her spirit with me the past couple of days. When I think about what brings my comfort when I'm feeling really emotional about my mom, I think about the time I got to spend with Julian.

Julian would be almost 7 years old today. I have his picture hung up in my living room. I hope he was adopted to a good home and has had a good life.

I live in Calgary now so I'm not looking to visit him or FaceTime with him, but I do have a few questions. If you adopted Julian and are reading this I'm curious to know if you changed his name, how big he got, if he's done OK, his temperament, and if he's given you the same love that he gave to me. I also want Julian's owner to know what he did for me, I still think about him often, and I'll never forget him.

Whenever I talk about my mom passing away in Pittsburgh, I always show a picture of Julian because he's such an important part of the story.

\-----  
P.S. Many diehard baseball fans also cheer for a team in the other league, so unsurprisingly my National League team is the Pirates. I also root for the Steelers and I'm not mad when the Penguins win (even when it's against the Leafs or Flames). I regularly wear Pirates, Penguins, and Steelers merch. One of these days I'll buy a Panthers hoodie.

P.P.S. I'm often asked if my mom made it to the Cher concert. She did not, but I still went although I was initially hesitant to do so. I couldn't imagine doing anything fun while my mom was in the ICU. However, the West Penn staff and everybody who knew my mom back in Canada said since the concert was our primary reason for the trip than I should go. I also knew I had to go and joked that if I didn't, her ghost would have haunt me after she passed away. If there was 1 final way to honour my mom while she was still alive (albeit unconscious), it was going to the concert. While the concert is a blur, I've never regretted going.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

*Contact the shelter:*

>I reached out to them a while ago and they couldn't assist me for confidentiality reasons which is completely understandable.  
*To another commenter:*  
And I absolutely respect his owner's privacy. That's why I've decided not to push ASAP or spend time acting like a pseudo private investigator. If this post doesn't lead to Julian's owner reaching out, I won't be upset and I won't take it personal.  
Making this post was really cathartic. Several people have commented that they're touched by my story which I appreciate, so that's also good enough for me.

**42degausser:** If you ever want anything from Pittsburgh DM me happy to mail something over to you.

>**OOP:** I appreciate it, thank you. I may have to take you up on that someday. My ""must buy"" item is Sarris Chocolate in Canonsburg.  
I returned to Pittsburgh in 2022 for the baby shower of my mom's ICU nurse at West Penn. I returned to ASAP Rescue but they didn't remember me. I also went to the Target nearby and stood outside West Penn for about an hour reflecting. I also went to a Penguins game. 5 months before my mom's passing, we actually attended a Penguins game against the Leafs in Pittsburgh in which the Leafs shutout the Penguins. At that time we had already had our tickets to see Cher in Pittsburgh and I remember pointing out our section to my mom.  
Believe it or not, I still regularly text with the funeral home director who looked after my mom after her death.  
I was disappointed to see they removed the buffet in the Wheeling KFC.  
Getting anything imported from the U.S. is expensive at the moment due to the relationship between our countries at the moment. The exchange rate is also brutal. Once things get better, I hope to come back down again. NFL tickets are so expensive but attending a Steelers home game is on my bucket list.  
I love shopping in the U.S. in general due to the variety of products. U.S. Walmarts are about twice the size of Canadian stores. I'm always amazed at how many flavours of Oreos (amongst other products) there are. I know this is controversial, but I always have to bring back a couple bags of Dunkin Donuts coffee beans.

**ayellellwhyesesay:** I’ve got season tix in the fam (front row) id love to take you to a game sometime! PM me

>**OOP:** Thank you. I shall keep that in mind for my next trip to Pittsburgh.

**Savings\_Programmer\_5:** Although I don't have updated information on Julian I can provide, my daughter and I are two of the employees who helped you that day. Rescues don't get to see good things printed about them often, so we greatly appreciate this. I am so glad that Julian was able to provide some unconditional love and support during those difficult times and that we were able to facilitate that. 

>**OOP:** Wow, small world.  
I remember talking to you or somebody at ASAP about the travelling you do to rescue the dogs from kill shelters. It's such a huge thankless commitment and I have the utmost respect for what you and your staff do everyday.  
If I lived in the U.S., I would absolutely come to Pittsburgh to adopt my next animal from ASAP.

**typingfrombed:** OP, you should definitely post this on TikTok. The algorithm there truly algorithms! We will find Julian!!!! 😭🥹🥹

>**OOP:** I have TikTok but have never made one.  
I’ll be honest, it feels a little much for me to contact Pittsburgh media outlets but I also think it would make for a feel good fluff story. So if anybody wants to help me amplify my search through the local news, I’d be open to it.

**penntoria:** Just wanted to add - removing artificial support measures in the ICU is not playing god - it’s allowing natural events to happen. You did the only thing you could do for your mother.

>**OOP:** Thank you.  
What I was trying to say is that it was still a life and death decision, even if doing so was the only logical outcome.  
My mom didn't have a living will, but she had told me she wouldn't want to remain on life-support.  
When she went into cardiac arrest, the paramedics were able to quickly revive her. While I knew within the first several hours that my mom coming back to Canada alive seemed unlikely, the ICU Team at West Penn had some theories as to why my mom went into cardiac arrest and wanted to do some tests and try some treatment to see if they were correct.  
She was stable for the first couple of days and then went downhill even while on life-support. Removing my mom from life-support was the only option. But I still had to be the one to sign the DNR and officially tell the ICU Team they could turn off the life-support and let my mom pass. I'm also aware that she was already gone.  
Based on my professional experience and education, if I wasn't the one to tell the ICU Team they could remove my mom's life-support, they could have gotten a court-order.

I'm Gunther's dad! He's been an absolutely wonderful dog, the best you could ask for! He's grown to about 60 pounds, and is a bit anxious and shy around new people, but once he gets to know you he's the most loving dog there is! He's the biggest, best cuddler imaginable and is so careful and thoughtful about arranging his paws so he's never kicks you, and his mom and I always make sure he gets his time cuddling smushed between us every night and every morning.

He has three cat siblings and he gets along with them well (sometimes he even gets kisses from them and gets to cuddle with them too!). If any of the cats are in in his way at all, he'll sit and wait for them to move instead of barrelling past them. But if he hears them fighting, he'll sprint over there to make sure they play nice!

It's so great to see your post and to see the impact he's had on other people and how amazing he was even before we got him!

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/1nuv578/thank_you_pittsburgh/)**: September 30, 2025 (Next day, 2 days from OG post)**

**Title:** Thank You Pittsburgh....

I want to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart [for helping me to connect with](https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/1nsyoah/did_you_adopt_julian_from_asap_rescue_on_penn/) Julian’s a.k.a. Gunther’s human.

Gunther filled a hole that I didn’t realize needed filling. Spending time with him both before and after my mom’s death made it easier for me to cope. While the ICU Team at West Penn Hospital was also taking care of me by ensuring I was eating and comfortable, Gunther took care of me in a different way. 

When ASAP Rescue told me Gunther was a puppy, I thought he’d be super hyper which I wouldn’t have minded; I could have used the distraction. While I saw him being hyper around other dogs, he was super calm and gentle with me. He wouldn’t even play with his toys around me. He didn’t take his eyes off of me when we were together. When I gave him treats, he didn’t even give me puppy nibbles. When I was crying, he’d paw at me and give me a little lick. I held him like a baby and he fell asleep in my arms, which ASAP said they’d never seen him do before. They said around me, he was the calmest they’d ever seen him. I remember saying to somebody at ASAP, “I really needed him” and they replied, “And he really needed you.” They said it was nice he was able to get some extra TLC and attention.

I have a tattoo that says, ""Coincidence is God's Way of Remaining Anonymous"" and I can't help but think Gunther and I were destined to spend time with each other during the worst week of my life.

After connecting with 1 of Gunther’s human’s, I was overcome and overwhelmed with emotion which is why I abruptly went silent. I’ve spent the past day trying to collect my thoughts and understand why I’m feeling this way. I cannot put into words the mark that Gunther left on me that’s remained to this day.

I’ve never regretted not becoming Gunther’s human. The thing I wanted the most was for him to find a loving home and live the absolute best possible life. While I was confident ASAP would ensure that, I didn’t have official confirmation until yesterday. Almost everyday since April 22, 2019 I’ve either said or thought, “I wonder what happened to him. I hope he found a loving home.” Since I couldn’t be the one to provide him one, I hoped the universe would make it happen instead. 

The reason why it took me years to take such a bold step to get confirmation about Gunther is because I struggled to work up the courage in case his life didn’t turn out as I hoped it did, which would have destroyed me. However, I got to the point where I needed to find out either way; hence my post a couple of days ago. 

I think this is the most I’ve cried since losing my mom in 2019. But these aren’t tears of sadness, they’re tears of joy and relief. I feel like I finally got the closure I’ve wanted for so long. Gunther is such a special dog and the universe gave me exactly what I asked for when it came to giving Gunther a forever loving home.

These are also tears of gratitude for every single Pittsburgher. My mom suddenly collapsing, going into cardiac arrest and dying in Pittsburgh was a living nightmare that I would never wish on anybody. However, every single person I came into contact with in Pittsburgh & Canonsburg were beyond kind, compassionate, and supportive. My mom was my only living relative and every single Pittsburgher immediately became a member of my extended family. I love the people of Pittsburgh and after my mom died in The Steel City, I declared myself an honorary Pittsburgher for life and joked the Mayor should give me a Key to the City. It should go without saying that I especially love the staff at West Penn Hospital, ASAP Rescue, and my mom's funeral home director.

I mean it when I say that Pittsburgh is my 2nd favourite city in the world (the 1st being my hometown of Toronto). Just like Gunther left a permanent mark on me, the City of Pittsburgh has also left a permanent mark on me. I mean this in a literal sense as I got West Penn Hospital’s zip-code tattooed on my forearm the day after my mom died. 

I don’t think anybody would blame me if Pittsburgh was a painful place for me and one that I want to avoid for the rest of my life, but it is quite the opposite. My mom loved to travel, she always had another trip booked while on her current vacation. People who don’t know my mom are shocked to hear she died while on vacation, especially outside of her home country. Yet people who knew my mom were happy, because they knew she died doing what she loved alongside me. I ran into a former neighbour after my mom died, he asked which hospital, and after I said “She died while we were on vacation in Pittsburgh” he smirked and immediately goes, “I’m so sorry, it’s just that I know she really loved to travel” and I told him he was right so there was no need to apologize. 

The shirt I’m wearing in my picture says exactly what I feel, Pittsburgh truly is my happy place. My only regret about moving from Hamilton to Calgary, is that I’ve gone from being a 4-hour drive away to a 4-hour flight. This hasn’t stopped me from remaining connected to Pittsburgh. In 2022, I returned to Pittsburgh for the baby shower of 1 of my mom’s ICU nurses and I still text almost everyday with the Pittsburgh funeral home director who looked after my mom’s arrangements. I felt a closeness to my mom when I visited Pittsburgh that I've never felt anywhere else since her passing.

Once again, thank you Pittsburgh, I love you Pittsburgh, and I know I’m long overdue for another visit; which I hope to change in the new year.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

**monongahellyea:** Hugs to you. I’m so very sorry for your loss, but happy to know you connected with those caring for your four legged companion. Stories like these remind me how great the internet can truly be.

I saw you mention Sarris Candy on your previous post. I live in Canonsburg and would be happy to send you some of the good stuff. Just say the word.

>**OOP:** Social media can be such a cesspool, but the response to my initial post showed that it doesn't always have to be that way.  
I appreciate your offer. I'm currently in the midst of a healthy-living journey. I've lost almost 70 pounds with another 30 pounds to go. Perhaps after I've reached my goal, I'll reach out to you for some Sarris chocolate.

**boneykneecaps:** OP, I'm sorry for your loss, but I'm glad you were able to find comfort here in the Burgh. Thank you for sharing your story.

>**OOP:** Certain cities have certain reputations, some good and some bad. Overall, I believe Pittsburgh has a pretty neutral reputation. I've never heard people generally say they love it, nor have I heard people generally say they hate it.  
I think it's cool to have a city I feel so connected to that also isn't a place everybody flocks to (like NYC for example).

**brooklynbluenotes:** Thank you so much for sharing this amazing story. I just adopted a new rescue pup so it's especially hitting me in the feelings.

>**OOP:** I think a lot of people assume their rescue animal has had a rough life prior to adoption, and overall they probably have. But I hope others will now consider that their rescue animal might left a positive lifelong impression on somebody before they found their forever home.

**brokesciencenerd:** Pittsburgh loves you too ❤️

>**OOP:** Aww thank you. I've been so emotional the past few days but I don't feel sad. I was talking to my therapist yesterday and she said maybe I'm feeling homesick and yearning to return to Pittsburgh.

**notcarly1969:** Yes! This is the update I wanted. <3

>**OOP:** Me too, but I didn't think it would happen so fast.",44,1759809637.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,9,0.94,False
1o04ncj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o04ncj/aitah_for_blocking_my_coworkers_after_they/,AITAH for blocking my coworkers after they excluded me from a baby shower and turned the office against me?,"So, I (32F) work in an office with a few different units that all share the same floor. Earlier this year, one of my coworkers was having a baby shower that was hosted by her specific unit. I’m not in that unit, but my job involves working very closely with them every day.

When the shower happened, it felt like the entire office was invited except me and two other girls who also aren’t technically in that unit. The silence in the office was loud that day — suddenly everyone was gone, and the three of us were sitting there confused because we had no idea where they went. They came back about an hour later, laughing and carrying pastries and coffee, and that’s when we realized it had been a surprise baby shower for our coworker.

Even though I know now that it wasn’t a “whole office” event, it still really hurt my feelings. I had considered these people my friends — I even invited a few of them, including the expecting coworker, to my wedding. They got email invites and had known about the shower for weeks but didn’t say anything to me. What really stung was that one of the interns (who barely knew the mom-to-be) was invited.

I got pretty upset. I kind of “crashed out” emotionally — I didn’t talk to them much for a while and was really quiet around the office. I know that probably made things awkward, but I just felt excluded and embarrassed.

After some time, I apologized to the group for being distant and tried to rebuild the friendship. It took over a month before things felt somewhat normal again, and I was eventually added back to the group chat I’d left.

But over time, I started to notice changes in how that one coworker (the one who was also left out) acted toward our new girl. She would complain about her constantly — and honestly, a lot of her complaints were petty or just plain dumb. As a friend, I listened, but I didn’t really agree with her most of the time.

Eventually, I got tired of the negativity and told her privately, in person, that I wasn’t interested in talking trash about the new girl. She didn’t take it well — she didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day and literally stormed off when we were finally able to go home.

The next day, she barely spoke to me when I tried to be nice to her, and then walked past my desk with the other coworkers while giving me nasty looks. None of them asked me what happened, but it was obvious she’d told them something because they completely iced me out that whole day.

At that point, I was just done. I felt like there was no saving the work friendships — if one person can turn everyone against me that easily, then it’s not worth my energy trying to rebuild trust that isn’t there. I deleted and blocked them all. I’m also not interested in being friends with people who make fun of others for their appearance.

Since then, these last few weeks have been hell — the tension, the awkwardness, the cold shoulders. Now I can’t tell if I’m the problem for reacting the way I did, or if I just finally stood up for myself.

For context, the mom-to-be had no hand in planning the shower — it was a surprise party organized by her unit — so I don’t hold any of this against her.

So… AITA for being distant and cutting off my coworkers after all this?

It rained early and stopped when we reached the Punggol MRT for the start of the walk. I have never been to Punggol before so the water way was a real eye opener for me. And the walk was very pleasant and not so hot. The first ~~Pokémon~~ three Ollie were easy to catch, the last two was a bit harder. I was lucky to get all 5, my travelling partner got only 4. I also went to visit the SIT campus, I have never seen 80 cent coffee before ( and I think the refill is free?) anyway, the walk is under 5km, started at 8am from NEX MRT and came back by 11am to NEX MRT with lots of breaks and coffee session in between.

Btw, I saw two monitor lizards in the canal next to Coney Island.

1o04mt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1o04mt0/catherine_coulter_books_in_order/,Catherine Coulter Books In Order,"Hey everyone,

I just finished diving into a Catherine Coulter thriller, and I really wanted to share my thoughts, especially for those of you looking for your next exciting read or maybe just starting your journey into the world of books. If you're curious about exploring more of her work, you can find a comprehensive list of [Catherine Coulter Books In Order](https://pdfhive.com/catherine-coulter-books-in-order/).

Right off the bat, if you're into those fast-paced FBI thrillers with a good dose of suspense and a dash of character drama, then a Catherine Coulter book is probably right up your alley. Without giving anything away, this particular one centers around a complex case that pulls our familiar FBI agents into a web of secrets and danger. There's usually a clever villain, a race against time, and plenty of unexpected turns to keep you guessing.

What I really enjoyed about this book, and many of Coulter's novels, is how quickly you get pulled into the story. The pacing is fantastic; it’s like a rollercoaster that just keeps going. I found myself thinking, ""Just one more chapter,"" repeatedly, which is always a sign of a good page-turner. The characters, particularly the main FBI agents, feel familiar and real, like old friends you're catching up with. You get invested in their personal lives as much as their professional cases, which adds a nice layer of depth to the thrill.

Now, for a balanced view, there were a couple of tiny things worth mentioning. Sometimes, with thrillers that have so many twists, the plot can get a little intricate, requiring you to pay close attention to every detail. If you're someone who likes a super straightforward narrative, you might find yourself pausing to piece things together. Also, while I enjoy the blend, sometimes the romantic subplot can feel a little strong for what is primarily a suspense novel. It’s definitely not a deal-breaker, but it’s something to consider if you prefer your thrillers purely action-driven.

For anyone new to reading or to thrillers, here’s a little guide based on my own experience:

*   **Step 1: Just Start!** Pick a book that catches your eye. Don't overthink it. The first few chapters are like the opening credits – let them draw you in.
*   **Step 2: Find Your Rhythm.** Don't feel you have to read for hours. Sometimes, just 15-20 minutes a day is enough to keep the story moving and build a reading habit. I often read a few pages while waiting for my coffee to brew!
*   **Step 3: It's Okay to Not Finish.** This is a big one! If a book isn't grabbing you after a fair shot (say, 50-100 pages), it's completely fine to put it down. There are millions of books out there; life's too short to force yourself through one you're not enjoying.
*   **Step 4: Explore Different Genres.** Don't pigeonhole yourself. While I love a good thriller, I also enjoy fantasy or a cozy mystery sometimes. You might surprise yourself!

**My personal tip:** Try to minimize distractions. Find a quiet spot, put your phone on silent, and just let yourself get lost in the words. It's truly a wonderful escape.

So, would I recommend this book? Absolutely! If you're a casual reader looking for an engaging story that will keep you guessing, especially if you enjoy police procedurals or psychological thrillers with strong characters and a touch of romance, then you're in for a treat. It's a great choice for a weekend read or if you need something to liven up your daily commute.

1o04lpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1o04lpd/need_advice_on_breaking_out_of_my_silent_and/,Need Advice on Breaking Out of My Silent and Nervous Shell at Work - Feeling Invisible and Disrespected,"Been working at a medium-sized, well-known Australian corporation for about five months now, and I’m really struggling with the social and communication dynamics here.

When I joined, I was extremely nervous because I didn’t know much about the industry and felt totally out of my depth. Kept quiet in meetings and conversations, thinking it was better to stay silent than say something wrong. But over time, I’ve found that my silence has kind of become a pattern, and now, I feel like I've lost my voice entirely.

The thing is, I’m now the last person anyone listens to when I speak in meetings/lunch banters/coffee catch ups etc. In fact, most of what I say just gets lost in the noise. It’s a bit worse outside of formal work settings too; whenever there are lunch breaks or coffee chats, I try to join in, but when I start speaking, the conversation feels one sided and I feel no one likes to engage with me. To be precise, no one counters or follows up on anything I say, even if I try to add to the banter. I’m also not invited to any team lunches or coffee breaks, and I’ve become pretty much a loner at this point.

What’s even more frustrating is that, despite me trying to network and connect with them, I’m constantly shot down. I feel like my timid mannerisms (which I’m sure are a result of my anxiety) have formed a kind of image of me that people just seem to stick with. I get the sense that no one wants to invest in a conversation with me because they already think they know who I am: quiet, shy, and awkward.

This has created a situation where I’m constantly nervous at work, especially when I need to discuss something critical or make a point in a meeting. I’ve tried speaking up, but it always feels like I’m either ignored or shut down right away. I often just keep to myself, which only reinforces the cycle.

This is not who I want to be. I’m naturally an extrovert and I know I can contribute to the team, but I’m stuck in this cycle of feeling invisible. I really want to change this dynamic, but I’m not sure how to break out of this shell.

Has anyone been through something similar? How can I start being more visible at work and rebuild my confidence? I’d appreciate any advice or strategies you have for getting noticed and overcoming this self-doubt!",1,1759809472.0,auscorp,0,1.0,False

It took me 2-3 years to understand and accept that I was actually bi or bi-curious. I had to do a lot of explaining to friends and family.

For the past 2 years I’ve been trying to date women, but with not much success. The most would get to a 2nd date before one of us shuts it down. 

But a week ago, I was at a coffee shop and I saw this woman that looked cool and interesting. She was sitting alone reading a book. I had to spend 5 minutes hyping myself up to go talk to her, but I finally did. We ended up chatting for 2 hours and it was a really nice time. We exchanged numbers and a few days ago we met again to go to a music event. 

During this event we got much closer and started holding hands and we even slow danced with our bodies very close together. It was the first time I felt like I was developing strong romantic and sexual feelings for a woman. I’m definitely falling for her and keep thinking about her…

We have another date scheduled in a couple days. I’m excited. I would like to kiss her. 

I’m just a little nervous that she doesn’t feel as strongly as I do, despite her initiated much of the physical contact. But either way, I’m glad I’ve had this experience as it has shown me how it feels to be strongly attracted to a woman. ",1,1759809190.0,bisexual,0,1.0,False

thejacquelineadan Day 3 of our roadtrip and we are in Utah!
Something about this day just felt special.
From the wide-open views, the salt
""mountains"", the ""Welcome to Utah"" sign and to wandering through Salt Lake City - I instantly fell in love. 

The people were kind, the energy was welcoming and the area the coffee shop was in we stopped had all the good vibes — inclusive, safe, warm, and full of love. ff and the coffee was amazing!!!

And without giving too much away...you might want to remember this coffee shop
Physically and mentally I was still feeling really good by this time in our trip. My legs were sore and a little extra swollen but ok (I was wearing my compression every night) and we were not in high elevation yet so my breathing was good. I was drinking plenty of water and my eating was ok...when I travel it's hard to make sure l am eating enough, especially protein so I was still doing ok by this point but knew I would have to do a little better with making sure I nourish my body.
So let's keep heading East...where things might take a quick turn ....

One of the major changes I've been working on in this neighborhood is creating a park that snakes along the edge of the neighborhood. The park features a hilltop amphitheater and cafe, where you can go grab a cup of coffee, watch a local band, and enjoy the city skyline as your backdrop! The park also features hiking trails, and is adjacent to a greenbelt with integrated light rail. I included screenshots of some other areas of the city that I've been working on as well.

I’m getting used to tracking billables and I’m reallyyyy struggling. I feel like I’m really shooting myself in the foot and I would really like some advice.

I don’t know how, but every day the time just flies away from me. I come in at 8am but one conversation with a coworker, getting coffee, and finishing checking my emails eats up 30 minutes. Then I start working and tracking my time, but I suddenly remember an item I had to buy for the house or an email I had to check on my personal email. That takes another 15 minutes. Then getting more water and getting sucked into another conversation eats up another 20 minutes. And on and on… I think I have ADHD because it is really hard for me to focus on one task for several hours at a time (I’m sure when I get more things to do this won’t be as bad).

Even if I shut my door (which helps a lot in terms of people not coming in to my office and interrupting), I still feel like I get distracted so easily and I end up losing a lot of time. I’ve tried to block my time—that works some of the time. I listen to background music while I work so I don’t get so distracted. I use software which lets me start and stop the timer and has helped me immensely in tracking time. I’ve made a massive effort to try to stay in my office all day and not talk to people as often so I’m not losing time chatting. But I’m still billing only 6-7 hours a day, 8 very rarely. Most of the time I have to stay super late (i.e. 6pm-7pm, depending) to even reach 7 billable hours. My firm’s requirement is 1800 a year.

Has anyone else experienced this and if so, what did you do? I’m trying to give myself some grace because I’m getting used to everything but I’m really struggling with staying on top of tasks for long periods. Should I take intentional breaks so I can focus better? I’m already cutting my lunch in half (we get an hour lunch) and it’s not enough. I read a lot of the posts on here but I feel I may need some additional advice. Any help would be appreciated, thank you :)

I had a normal morning, ate breakfast of eggs cheese veggies and toast. I had some coffee with creamer and collagen peptides. I’ve had this same breakfast hundreds of times. I got started working at my desk job, and at about 9:30am, I took a tincture .25mg as I have done periodically in the past to help me calm and focus. I have an active medical card and am very careful about intake as I don’t like feeling out of body or control. I then went to my last physical therapy appt for treatment of occipital neuralgia and felt really good after the visit. I came back home, made a simple salad with carrots cucumber sliced turkey, balsamic and a bit of ranch. I also had a half a slice of leftover pizza. I took a sip of my water when I tasted a bit of residue from my tincture, but thought nothing of it and told myself I needed to now wash that straw and water bottle. I was sitting at my desk ready to keep working when I felt super off. This was about 12:30pm. Lightheaded. I stood up to walk around a bit and I felt weird and dizzy. I then laid down to see if I could just get through it. I laid there for about 20 min and still felt weird. I started feeling a racing heartbeat. I could hear it even. I checked my watch and it was about 100. I thought that was so weird especially since I had been laying down for a bit. Then it just kept getting worse. It jumped to 115, then 120.. so I stood up and felt like I immediately needed to sit. Kind of felt nauseated. I starting getting really nervous about my heart rate, which I know didn’t help. So I tried to get up again and felt very dizzy and decided to sit and call paramedics as my heart rate had gotten to 140. Just in case. 

They came and said that I wasn’t having a heart attack thank goodness, but that I should probably be seen to rule out anything else. I had my mom drive me and the whole time I felt waves of chills and breathlessness.. like I was almost going to pass out. Muscle spasms and tingling down both outer arms. Hard to focus and very weak. 
Finally got to a room and finally felt like I was able to calm myself. Xray fine, bloodwork ok. My glucose was elevated for my history, some high neutrophils and low lymphocytes.. but nothing the doc seemed concerned about. They gave me fluids and put on a heart monitor I will wear for 7 days. 

My question is, could this be from that small dose of a tincture? Or is it a full blown anxiety attack of some kind? There was no apparent trigger for that.. but what the hell just happened to me?",1,1759807672.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1o03z8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1o03z8a/food_chains_that_are_worth_it_in_japan/,Food chains that are worth it in Japan,"I've heard lots of dunking on chains, and while it's amazing to want to visit independent shops I found a lot of chains that are 100% worth trying and stood out to me amongst their competitors. Please put down your suggestions as well! Or if you've had bad experiences at any of these. 

*Disclaimer:* I will be omitting things like convenient stores, fast food chains, and western food chains. I will try to only list Japan-wide chains, but there's a few that's region specific. 

**Oreyu Shio Ramen (Tokyo):** The best ramen chain, and one of the best ramen's I've had. Their broths are rich, perfectly salted and their chashu is melt-in-your-mouth tender. The noodles are elastic and everything comes together perfectly in their classic shio ramen.

**Tenkaippin (Kansai):** Classic and beloved, it was recommended to me by a Osaka native and it did not disappoint. The noodles could be better but their broths are excellent and LOTS of varieties. Not to mention their prices are very reasonable and most are open till very late. 

**551 Horai (Kansai):** Not overhyped, their pork buns are crazy fluffy and the pork stuffing is so savory and juicy and perfectly seasoned. I always come straight from the airport to a 551 Horai every time for a 6 pack of pork buns and box of shu mai. 

**Tsukemen Tetsu (Japan):** Have a hard time drinking all that ramen soup? I feel you, and this place's tsukemen is the perfect alternative. I got the classic spicy dipped noodles and it's one of my top recommendations for food, not even chain. The concentrated dipping broth is a flavor bomb and the noodles are super thick and chewy. 

**Hanamaru Udon (Japan):** Cafeteria style food place where you pick your udon base, pick your toppings/sides, pay, seat yourself and help yourself to unlimited tea, water, and green onions. You'll get a filling and delicious hot udon soup with karaage and other fried goodies for under $10. Efficient and delicious.

**Komeda's Coffee (Japan):** Out of all the cafe chains this is hands down the best one and I will not hear anyone out. The atmosphere is always so cozy, their egg sandwich is literally the best and yes I am including the 7/11 egg sando. I always have a great time here, I don't feel rushed, and can always expect good food, good service, and a happy environment. 

**Yayoiken (Japan):** Lots of people sleep on this place, but if you want a traditional Japanese breakfast this is where to go. They sell a huge variety of sets for all Japanese meals and is really cheap for the amount of food you get. 

**Tsukiji Gindaco (Japan)**: Incredible takoyaki restaurant that's fast and delicious and the flavor is always consistent and reliable. They are on par with the takoyaki over on Dotonbori, and have some unique combinations that's fun to try out. 

**Tendon Tenya (Japan):** No words. Just absolute love. They serve a mountain of tempura in various combinations over rice and soaked in a sweet sticky soy tare sauce. Never had a bad meal here. They are fast, and again, consistent flavors at any location. 

**Gyoza no Manshu (Japan):** Decent gyozas and other Chinese dishes. This chain is all over Japan and have great prices. Are their gyozas the best? No. But you won't regret eating here because their gyozas are always filling, cooked to crispy perfection, and very delicious. ",18,1759807498.0,JapanTravelTips,36,0.82,False
1o03yfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ahmedabad/comments/1o03yfx/24_m_visiting_home_looking_to_connect_with_like/,24 M visiting home: Looking to connect with like minded folks,"I’m visiting home after a long time. I usually come every couple of years, but this time I’ll be staying for a month. I left Ahmedabad when I was 17, and over the years, I’ve lost or outgrown most of my friends partly because of distance, but also because of how living away from home changes a person.

I’m a non-resident Indian, currently settled abroad. My interests include literature, coffee, hiking, philosophy, and music. I’d love to connect with like-minded people and make some new friends while I’m home. 

It’s always been difficult for me to reconnect in Ahmedabad. I left at a fairly young age, and now when I return I often find my views to be more open and liberal while Ahmedabad, at least the one I remember remains quite conservative.

Definitely wasn’t on my bingo card at this age. But none of my life has been. 

Some of my red flags because it’s important to get those over first, I’m stubborn, I’m picky about who I let into my life, I spend way to much time at the gym, I need at least 3 coffees a day to function, I yap more than I should and I curse like a sailor. My desk is a mess and I  don’t like anime or video games. 

Some of my green flags because that’s also important. I’m funny, I’m kind, I’m a blast to drink with. I have superb music taste. I love dive bars and shitty dancing in them. I love sports. I make a mean apple pie. I consider myself a glizzy connoisseur.  I’m always down for an adventure but I also love a good night in. I can drink most men under the table and I love beer. (Thanks mom) 

You’ve definitely seen me before - you’ll probably see me again. I’m 5’6, thick, and I care like 87% of the time, the rest is whatever’s clean and comfy. Here is me - scroll for a few key looks I serve (cute, gym, makeupless) : https://imgur.com/a/lFdExYW

What am I looking for? A SFW good time. A riveting conversation. A concert buddy. A coffee buddy. The love of my life. A dive bar pal. The guy I can call when I have an extra ticket to a game. Props to whoever is all of these, beggars can’t be choosers. 

Downvote me for this, but I believe mutual attraction is incredibly important. I don’t have a specific type, but I know what I like. I try to be honest when I’m not into someone and I try not to lead anyone on. Please be willing to share a photo on here. If this is your 5th new profile this year - don’t message me to try again (I know can limit this but I’ve even some great people with new profiles too). Ages ~26-42. I bend the rules but that’s my general interest. Extra points to men with GOOD tattoos. Extra Extra points if you’re funny, can start and hold a conversation and your message to me doesn’t come off as copy and pasted. I never respond to “hi” or “hello” style messages.

I work at a bakery café where mornings are chaos. We have to brew coffee, set up displays, slice bread, prep muffins, etc. The unspoken rule was that whoever opened came in 10–15 minutes early to get everything ready, otherwise customers would walk into a mess.

Well, new district manager came in and saw me clocked in at 5:47 instead of 6:00. She lectured me, saying “No one is allowed to clock in a second early  we don’t pay for that. If you’re on the floor, you’re working for free.”

Fine. The next morning, I sat in my car until exactly 6:00. I walked in with customers right behind me. Coffee? Not brewed. Muffins? Still in trays. Pastry case? Empty. She came running out asking why nothing was ready. I smiled and said, “You told me not to clock in early. Everything starts at six.”

Now she has to come in herself at 5:45 to do prep if she wants it done.",898,1759807114.0,MaliciousCompliance,50,0.94,False

A week after that, I ended up in the hospital with kidney stones and a horrible UTI. I was literally peeing blood, and to make things worse, I didn't have health insurance at the time. It's confusing because I only drink water and coffee, so I have no idea how it even happened.
And today, I had to block a very close friend apparently because I went MIA and didn't answer her every call. I'm usually the one who makes her feel better, but the moment I pulled back to take care of myself, she made me feel guilty for it.

1o03llq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1o03llq/how_can_i_safely_rotate_psychoactive_compounds/,How can I safely rotate psychoactive compounds that act on different neurotransmitter systems to avoid tolerance?,"I've recently been thinking on how to increase ""net chemical happiness"" throughout my lifetime with the least amount of downsides. 

In order for you to get the idea, the most extreme version of what I'm saying is being connected to a matrix-like sci-fi machine providing everlasting bliss. 

But, because that's currently impossible, I was wandering if there's any way to ""hack"" the brain's down-regulation system to temporarily increase different ""feel good chemicals"", and while they regulate, increase different ones independently.

For example:

THC targets the endocannabinoid system

Psilocybin targets serotonin (5-HT2A)

Caffeine target dopamine & norepinephrine

Kava targets GABA

Those are just the ones I know, although because of legality issues and because I'm still researching, I only really ever occasionally try THC, and drink coffee of course (I also take Vyvanse in the morning for ADHD, prescription).

This also relates to a fundamental question I still can't find an answer to:

If while sober my dopamine level is X, and then I take a substance and it becomes X+1, will it become X-1 after the substance wears off? If not, that means it is indeed possible to increase ""net dopamine"" throughout a person's lifetime, thus making them ""chemically happier"" than a completely sober person.",3,1759806346.0,Biohackers,4,1.0,False

So there I was walking down the block for a coffee and saw these under some cat toys.

I don’t know anything about audio but have dabbled in vinyl setups a little and my dad is pretty into it. What caught my eye was the original paperwork on the back.

I texted my dad asking if they were worth picking up and he gave an immediate yes and followed that AR speakers were “really good in their day and worth fixing up”. 

No idea if they work or what kind of resto I’d be looking at but my dad has a shop he likes for re-coning etc. and I figure it could be a fun project for us since he’s a pretty gifted electrician who used to fix this stuff for fun/beer money.

1o03jzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Austin_Native_2/comments/1o03jzx/options_expired_teen_license_tx_1824yo_driver/,Options: expired teen license (TX 18-24yo & Driver Education),"If you're 18-24yo in Texas and needing to renew your expired teen license, then you have two (2) options.

**ATTENTION:** The permit/license you received as a teen expired the day you turned 18yo. You cannot legally drive at all since that day without a new license; restricted 'adult permit' or unrestricted.

To get the renewed license, you must complete all requirements for *either* the teen *or* adult driver education course. But, you need to make a decision (now) on which you're going to do before you go into DPS.

**Option 1** -- Complete *all* requirements of whatever teen education you started. That includes coursework and driving hours -- both with an instructor ($, certificate upon completion) and a parent/guardian; these are detailed on the [Provisional License](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/texas-provisional-license-teen) page. Make sure you have the appropriate certificates from the driving school/course (e.g. DE-964/DEE-964) as applicable. You really should only need to show these to DPS once. So you may have already done that in the past. You do *not* need to complete everything before going to DPS. You can complete them in due time at your own pace.

**Option 2** -- Abandon the teen education and just take a six (6) hour adult course (~$40-100). As needed, you can search/confirm for [approved/certified course providers](https://www.tdlr.texas.gov/driver/education/providers/search/). There are no driving hours required. If you choose this path, then you must complete the course *before* you go to DPS.

When you're ready to get a DPS appt via the [Scheduler](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/driver-license-services-appointments), you'll sign in with your (expired) license number. Almost all of the appt options will get you in the door (waiting room). There should be an employee there to help you check in and make sure you know what form(s) to fill out (as applicable). I believe the top option for 'APPLY FOR FIRST TIME TEXAS DL/PERMIT' should be grayed out and not available to you. You just need the next option for 'CHANGE, REPLACE OR RENEW TEXAS DL/PERMIT.' And if that's not available, then go with the option near the bottom titled 'SERVICE NOT LISTED OR MY LICENSE IS NOT ELIGIBLE.' If for some crazy reason none of those are available (which I doubt), then log in without using your license number (as it's optional).

Do not schedule a road test appt unless that's the *only* thing you need to do. Those appts will be treated separately from the 'desk/paperwork' appts. You should not expect to have a desk appt and road test during the same visit. This licensing ordeal is almost exclusively a two (2) appt process.

At your first DPS appt, make sure to tell the DPS CSR that your old license expired so they can pull up your profile (DL#). And *specifically* tell them you want to apply for a *B-Restricted* Class C driver's license. It's an 'adult permit' in that it'll require that you have a 21yo+ licenced passenger in the front seat whenever you drive. The restricted license should be valid for eight (8) years so there's no rush to take the road test ... except to gain that pure freedom of solo driving. Once you're ready, pass the road skills driving test to have the restriction removed. 

**NOTE:** Don't let them have you apply for an unrestricted license because then you'll be on the clock to get the road test passed within 90 days. And getting a road test appt in time may be an issue. There's just no benefit to the 90 day scenario.

It can't hurt to print out the [DL-14A](https://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/DL-14A.pdf) application ahead of time and fill in what you can. Just leave *anything* blank that you're not absolutely sure of. The DPS CSR will help and make sure everything is filled out properly.

I'll assume that you already provided your Real ID supporting documents when you got your first license/permit, but I suggest you take those documents with you again just in case. You also took the written/knowledge test to get your permit so that's already checked off as complete in their database. You will not have to take it again unless your license has been expired for two (2) years or more.

This (paragraph) likely won't be relevant for your particular needs, but I'm going to leave it here in case it's somehow useful to anyone. One thing specific to [Real ID documents](https://www.dps.texas.gov/apps/DriverLicense/RealID/) (or this easier [What To Bring](https://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/DL-15.pdf) PDF) that some folks have trouble with are the residency requirements. You may already have your own qualifying residency documents. But if you don't (and you live with someone), then you may be able to meet the [residency requirements](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/texas-residency-requirement-driver-licenses-and-id-cards) by filling out a [Texas Residency Affidavit Form DL-5 (PDF)](https://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/DL-5.pdf) with whomever you live. They'll likely need to go with you to DPS and provide the required residency documents (with their name & address as if they were the one getting a DL). Basically, they vouch for you. Again, this is only needed if you don't have your own residency documents.

Before you road test, you'll need to watch the appropriate free [Impact Texas Driver (ITD)](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/impact-texas-drivers-itd-program) video no more than 90 days beforehand. The certificate is only good for 90 days. If you completed the teen education course (Option 1) then you need the 2-hr teen ITTD video regardless of your current age. If you're going with the adult course (Option 2), then you'll need to watch the 1-hr adult ITAD video. Passing the road test will then remove the B restriction.

https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/apply-texas-driver-license

And finally, here's a bit of extra advice:
* Create a [Texas x Texas (TxT)](https://txt.texas.gov/) portal login and link your DL and any vehicle you own accordingly. Make sure to turn on notifications for renewals and expirations.
* Keep your DL info safe somewhere. If you ever need the DD audit number from it, the card is the *only* place you can get it. And that'll be required if you ever need to get a replacement online etc. So take a picture of it or write down the info; picture is by far preferred. Keep it in a secure folder on your phone, in a drawer, hide it in a coffee can in the freezer, email it to yourself... whatever. But keep it available by whatever means with which you're comfortable. I also suggest this for car insurance and medical/health insurance cards.",1,1759806208.0,u_Austin_Native_2,0,1.0,False

but on the bottle, it says 1 drop = 2 tsp of sugar = 1 packet of splenda

but when I try and make my normal coffee, I need WAY more drops than what I use per packet, unless my drops with the dropper is somehow way smaller (I am talking like 2x - 3x number of drops if not more...).

Like I put the dropper in the bottle, then just lightly tap the end so a drop of liquid drops in, and I try to match what I have with splenda at 10 packets per 750ml and it was more or less nothing? Which makes something like starbucks at home (yeah I know its a lot of sugar / splenda but its how I like my coffee / tea).

Hi everyone,

Before I get started I am pleading with you to not judge me, I have made many mistakes in my life but I am coming here because I have nowhere to turn to. I am a dedicated father who loves his kids very much would do anything for them.

I am M40s and her as well. We've been married 14yrs. We have 2 teenage boys. I think there were red flags from the beginning. I knew her ex when she was briefly married. She was beautiful and I was just coming off a breakup. We made eye contact when her ex introduced us and I felt a spark, but she had just gotten married to her-ex and I felt guilty since I knew the guy and a little odd that she would checking out another man, early in her married life (apparently it lasted 2 months). So I just told myself I am imagining shit. Fast forward 2years later, we met on Facebook through another friend. I was coming off a breakup when we started chatting and realized she was the one from few years ago, and I actually thought it was meant to be. I fell fast and hard, even though it was early she started showing signs of possessiveness. She was gorgeous and I was average I guess I looked past it. She was amazing in bed. We had our huge first fight when she saw my ex had emailed me some job postings because I was in between jobs at that time. I should have broke it off then since her reaction was if I was sleeping her. I tried to understand her perspective since I was head over heals in love with her. These kinds of bursts would occur relatively frequently and she would come back strong and I would fall for her even harder. We eventually got married within 9 months against my family's will, since my family asked me to slow down and she refused to wait. My family knew something was off about her and they refused to come to our wedding, I begged her to give me sometime and she wouldnt and try to kill herself. I felt trapped, I had no family in the city where I lived (they lived in a different country). I eventually gave in and we went ahead with the marriage without anyone from my family being there for me.

She started to become more and more controlling after the marriage, she wouldnt let me go out to see my friends and let me have my friends over. This over time led to me loosing most of my social network except for couple of friends. Even they were pretty distant since they knew there would be arguments at home if spoke to me. The arguments, belittling, physical abuse, cussing me and my family off, the lists goes on. It was a nightmare from the beginning, I left her and moved out a couple of times and somehow her family convinced me to get back with her promising me she will change. Yes I know I should never have gone back. We went to therapy and tried to work it out, and as soon as the marriage councilor started making progress in identifying her issues, she refused to go back. She was better for a few months after went back to her and she got pregnant. The first pregnancy, where do I begin, complete drama with her hormones going nuts she got worse.

I stuck it out because I wanted the baby to be ok. The abuse and the drama continued for a few years with our second kid was 1 yr old. We were as usual going through another fight and stopped talking for a while. Meanwhile I am paying all the bills and she would take care of the kids while on mat-leave. One day I walk-in and her pc was turned on and I decided to login to check for something online, Her skype (yes 10yrs ago) opens and starts to fill up the messages from some guy and her I guess being on mat-leave made her bored or something but this was full on cyber sex. Some dude she had met online prior to meeting me. I was completely devastated. Just thinking about it hurts my core. I confront her and lost my shit, she refused to admit it until I mentioned the guys name. She eventually admitted she was bored and got carried away. Since it was online and nothing else happened I forgave her. Couple of years later she was chatting with another guy but no sexting but would be making video calls with that guy to avoid typing anything. I had enough and I brought proof to her family and confronted her and she did admit and since there were obvious infidelity she somehow convinced her family I was being too paranoid. So since then the trust between us was pretty much gone. I never trusted her and she felt betrayed because I exposed her to her family. I know its completely messed up with all the problems for to stick around, I clearly have issues of my own for not walking away at the first sign of red flag, I get it so before you judge me hear me out. After the intervention she got a little better, we become a bit closer (so I thought, yes fucking dysfunctional AF).

We started raising the kids together. I did notice the chemistry between us was not as good as it was before that but thats life. Through out the years we would have our ups and downs but she never changed her abusive, manipulative behaviour and I became numb to it and her behavior wouldnt change. She would hit, kick, spit and call me names right in front of the kids, and yes our kids grew up witnessing all this. She would blame me as the abuser to her family. At this point I am completely isolated from all my friends and family. I was busy raising the kids and I stuck around in a way to be there for the kids and sort of protect them from her anger and abuse. Over the years I have become stagnant in my career, which I blame myself but home situation didnt help. I helped her guide her career over the years advising her to make the right moves and now she is manager at major clothing firm. She was heavily involved in the community and everyone thought she was this amazing woman. I didnt want to get in her way and would let her do what she wanted for events and so on and most of them I would refuse to go since they didnt interest me or I had to take the kids to activities. I just didnt feel like pretending to be all happy when she is a monster at home. I admit I wasnt a perfect husband, I have retaliated a few times to her physical and verbal abuse but I never would initiate. This kind of relationship instability has caused the kids have anxiety and nightmares. I am sticking around for them because I know she would do the same to them if I left them alone. Dont get me wrong she is a great mother when she is on her normal self, but as her episodes come she is someone else. I am sure its BPD but I dont want to trigger anyone trying to self diagnose. I have begged her for years to seek help, but she blames me for her issues.

So coming to issue at hand, I recently took her phone away from my kid who was spending too much time on it. As I was putting it away, I see a message coming from some guy, my heart sank, not again !!!!!. I look at the message and I see some guy messaging her to meet for a coffee, this guy known for being flirty with women in the community. I took screen shots. I check her browsing history and I see her searching how to configure disappearing messages on instagram if anyone can track install calls and , dick picks. I fucking knew it then she never changed she was hiding it better. I dont know if she only did online or offline affairs, but at this point I knew I had to do something. I confront her and ususl BS that I am insecure and controlling and abusive. This time I knew she was acting different as if she was done with me. My instincts told me she was planning something. It hurt, I have never felt her treat me that way. and finally tells me she is done with me. I was devasted. I knew I had to do something. I couldnt let her fuck me like this leave me.  I am certain she has had multiple affairs online but offline I have no proof of anyone. I am going through the motions, one minute I am enraged another I dont know if I can live without her

Can you guys help ? I am devasted I cant sleep, eat or work. I am asking for advise, I am in a very dark place now, started smoking again after 16yrs and almost a pack day. I am in desperate need for help.",1,1759805323.0,u_crypto_sniper_25,0,1.0,False

Turn it from “I have to study” → to “I’m mastering the language of the world.”

**🌍 1. Reframe what you’re** ***actually*** **studying**

You’re not just learning about markets, trade, and finance —  
you’re learning **how the world moves**.

* When you study *economics*, imagine the invisible threads connecting Tokyo, Paris, and Mexico City — goods, ideas, culture all flowing together.
* When you study *marketing*, you’re decoding human psychology — why people desire, dream, and buy.
* When you study *customs or logistics*, you’re learning to open invisible doors between nations.

📖 *You’re becoming a translator of cultures and opportunities.*

**🕯️ 2. Create an aesthetic around your studies**

Make the act of studying *feel cinematic*.

* Use neutral or warm lighting, a clean desk, a mug of coffee or matcha, soft jazz or lo-fi.
* Think: **“CEO studying for her empire”** or **“polyglot at an airport café with her laptop open, solving world problems.”**
* Use elegant stationery. Title your notes like chapters of a memoir:
   * “The Art of Negotiation — Chapter 3: Words that Move Nations.”
   * “Trade Routes: The Highways of Civilization.”

🎧 *Study playlist vibe:*  
Ludovico Einaudi · French café jazz · chill business lo-fi mixes.

**📈 3. See yourself as a strategist, not a student**

Every time you learn something new, imagine it as a *tool* you’re adding to your strategic arsenal.

You’re not studying —  
you’re **collecting mental weapons** for future moves:

* *Contracts = Control.*
* *Languages = Influence.*
* *Economics = Foresight.*
* *Marketing = Persuasion.*
* *Negotiation = Power.*

🕶️ Your mindset = “Every concept I master today will save me years of confusion tomorrow.”

**💬 4. Romanticize international business as human connection**

Trade is not just economics — it’s people, trust, and collaboration.

* Each import/export is the result of someone’s dream crossing oceans.
* When you read about a market, imagine the faces of the people whose lives depend on it — artisans, entrepreneurs, creators.
* When you learn *business etiquette or culture*, imagine yourself confidently walking into a boardroom in Milan or Seoul, effortlessly switching languages, connecting worlds.

💌 *You’re not just learning business; you’re learning diplomacy.*

**💡 5. Make it personal**

Tie your career to your **personal mission** — something that feels soulful.

* “I’m studying international business because I want to help artisans like my mom export their work globally.”
* “Because I want to create bridges, not borders.”
* “Because I believe ideas deserve to travel farther than people can.”

💬 When purpose meets knowledge, studying becomes passion.

**🪞 6. Visualize your future self**

Before studying, close your eyes and picture her:  
You — sitting in a modern office with panoramic city views, passport beside your notebook, calm, stylish, fluent in three languages.  
You understand cultures, make strategic decisions, and help businesses grow ethically and globally.

Every page you read brings her closer to existence.

**🗺️ 7. Turn study sessions into rituals**

Make studying *beautifully repetitive*:

* Light a candle before opening your books.
* Start with a quote (e.g., “The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.” — St. Augustine).
* Close with a journal reflection:
   * “What did I understand about the world today?”
   * “How did this topic make me see humans differently?”

📓 The goal: make each study session *a chapter in your own global story.*

**💼✨ In summary**

You’re not just studying International Business.  
You’re learning how the world breathes — and preparing to write your own chapter in it.",1,1759805169.0,u_Danielasandov216,0,1.0,False

Last time I posted this here many women came hard at me shaming me for making bad choices. But I am trying to carefully navigate my next steps. I’m open to all of your thoughts, only requesting for non-agressive comments as I already feel very down. Thank you and appreciate any meaningful advice!

When we first met my boyfriend had a lot of experience. He’s been with only 7 women in the past but he was hyperactive to the point of doing it almost daily and sometimes multiple times a day with some of these women. He started late at 25 and maybe tried to overdo it. Had long term relationships with 2 women out of these. Some were casual but most of his experience came from his long term girlfriends. On one hand its good that he was stable and monogamous. On the other hand he built all of his experience based on these one or two women and thought that was the universal case. Before meeting me he had just broken up from the two long term gfs and then was in college for post grad and managed to do some casual relationships. He has had sex atleast 500-600 times in the last 2.5 years. He’s had a shit childhood and was bullied and somewhat traumatized and I feel he used sex as a grown up as a coping mechanism for a lot of things and didn’t really stop and processed his emotions.

When we met we had known about each other for a few months and had a crush on each other. He had been single for a few months at this point.

When we first started dating, I told him I need time and was struggling with vaginismus. I hadn’t dated anyone in a while. I was looking to build emotional connection with someone before jumping into bed. While he was understanding and tried to be patient, he also got frustrated a bit quickly. He is a pretty good looking guy and many of the girls approached him. He never had to struggle or wait to get sex so I understand his frustration. I started trying to push myself to be able to do it easily. I wanted to do it too.

But instead of communicating his frustration calmly he stated it in a very weird manner where he made it obvious that he didn’t have to struggle this much with others. He has since apologized many times about this and completely changed. He realises his mistake.

Other than sex, he’s generally socially awkward introvert types so he states he didn’t know at the time how to properly communicate his feelings. I felt horrible and dehumanized for him to make it seem like I was not enough or taking time in bed while other women were able to do it easily. Also because I had been upfront since day 1 about wanting more time.

Its been a while now and he has changed completely and never says something like this now. He is completely obsessed with me, never shows frustration in this manner and has given me all the lead. We only do it when I approach him. Which has made me trust him more. This significant change in his behaviour has me confused. I love the bf he is now and I wish he was like this always.

However I can’t help but feel jealous of how he put his first gf on a pedestal. I know guys never easily forget about their first love but he didn’t have to tell me subtly how great she was even though it was long ago. It wasn’t fair of him to bring his hyperactive experience standards and apply them on me when I had been honest about my expectations since day 1 of taking it slow. Again he has completely changed now and is a wonderful bf in present day and appreciates me. But I resent him so much for making me even slightly feel like I had to act like his ex to get his affection. It affected my self worth. I started feeling less because of something that many women struggle with - vaginismus especially growing up in a conservative country. In modern day especially with dating apps I haven’t been able to find any guy who would be patient enough to understand such things and take it slow. While he didn’t push me, he showed it to me once or twice it was frustrating compared to others. He could have just left. He also did wilder things with others which I don’t think I’ll be able to do anytime soon like having spontaneous sex with his ex in a coffee shop toilet, doing it 7 times in one night etc. All of thess created extreme standards in his mind and when he met me, he liked me but I made him wait and was different and he couldn’t handle it maturely. I would have totally understood if he communicated to me that he just feels frustrated. He literally said “he never had to wait so much” and that made me feel pressured. He apologized immediately. He even stated at that time she was the best he ever had.

He admits that our relationship is the most meaningful and best relationship we had and we only struggled with sex. But I had that he felt comfortable appreciating exes in bed in front of me. Even if long ago. I hate him insinuating that we need time to get there. 

We have argued about this many times and it never happens now and we otherwise have a great relationship and it does seem like a mistake he made in the start coming out of the hoe phase no matter how stupid I think it is.

He has been there for me in difficult times and supported me and we have grown a lot together in career and life.

But I cannot help with the rj feeling with that one ex who was his first and he described it like she was so great and fun. He never made such appreciative comments about us. And I think it was much more significant for me because I pushed myself and overcame vaginismus to be able to do it easily. But he couldn’t see those efforts.

Idk what to do at this point. We have already dated 1.3 years. Idk if I can move on soon. I feel conflicted. On one hand I love him and cannot imagine leaving. On the other hand the RJ gets really strong.

I never had RJ before. I was okay with guys having a past and literally did not care. Around the time I was in my 20s no decent guy around me was not inexperienced. And it was not even something I was looking for. I have spoken to guys before or gone out with who had slept around a bit. But I wasn’t bothered. My RJ only got triggered after he mentioned in the start when we were still in the talking stage about his great past experiences at the same time showing frustration towards me. This is the most triggering thing. He made me feel shit and lacking behind while appreciated others. He talks about it as an immature phase but it impacted me and my self worth. I feel like he was 28 at this point and should have known better instead of working on his mistakes only after it completely distressed me. Its been a year of that not happening anymore but the resentment is so strong against him for making me lose my self worth because while he stopped I continued to feel for a while that I have to act like his ex to retain his love as he could only understand love and affection from that perspective. He most definitely for the first 3-4 months had standards especially for sex based on his past experiences instead of approaching me for who I am as my own individual person. I’m confused how to proceed now because while I consider leaving, I also need to consider how he radically changed for me and its only my resentment now. I feel conflicted to forgive him for making bigger mistakes and letting him have control over my self worth. So on one hand I feel I should work on my resentment. On the other I feel he should have been grown enough to act better.

Edit: to clarify, we have a great sex life now. I have significantly improved and just needed some time and an emotional connection and not have somebody push me. I also planned a lot of fun different activities for him like role play, costumes etc to show him I cared about his needs and everything. From my end I have been understanding of his needs but also open about my requirements since day 1. I only resent him for unknowingly comparing me making me feel less and thinking I have to behave like his exes to get his love. I wish I would have been approached and dealt with for who I am not for who I am not.",2,1759805021.0,TwoXIndia,6,0.6,False

met this guy at a bar in the summer. I’m F24, he’s M30.  we hung out a lot and had a talking phase for a month before he asked me out. i said yes of course, but sometimes i’m questioning if that was the right decision. my thoughts:

 -the age gap doesn’t bother me, but for some reason I feel as if he’s trying to fast track this relationship to get to the next stage of life- marriage, buying a house, kids, etc- only bc his friends are either engaged/ already married/ signing to buy their first house soon. he was so happy to have me meet his dad about a week after we became official, and i’ve met all of his friends before we had a title as well. he even made a snarky remark about how i hadn’t introduced him yet to my parents/ family, and how “i don’t want to be dating you for 6 months and not meet your parents. then i’ll feel some type of way”. (now- i guess i get his point, but this also felt very vaguely threatening. idk). he gave me a key to his apartment in like week three of our talking phase, didn’t even stop to ask how i felt about it. 
 
-i feel that he often dances on that line between cute and creepy obsession. i am a curvy woman, so often other men will glance at me, and he makes jokes about beating them up just for even breathing in my direction. i always laugh awkwardly bc i can’t tell if he’s joking or being dead serious. 
 
- he also made many many many remarks about how im “the love of his life” and how ill “make such a good wife” and “im going to marry you”. now, for some people, these comments would make them glow with happiness. but to me, it feels like he’s planning an entire life for us without filling me in. how does he feel so sure and strongly about me being “the love of his life” only 1.5 months of dating? feels strange. it feels manipulative. 
 
-during intimate moments, he makes me promise him that i’m “his forever and ever” and make me swear up and down that i “better not be talking to nobody else” and how i “better not be sleeping with anybody else”. these comments make me so uncomfortable that my  stomach churns and my palms burn hot and clammy. 
 
- he makes baby jokes all the time. saying things like “i’m so glad im choosing to have kids with you” or the other day, it was chilly so i was wearing black long sleeve T-shirt w blue jeans; he said “that looks like a good future mom outfit”. (for reference, im still in college working towards my degree with about a year left. i work part time and still live at home bc wtf is this economy rn. POINT BEING- i am in absolutely no position for a child right now. i have desires for them in the future, but not right now). i had to tell him the other day that i dont like those remarks, as they kinda weird me out. it’s like he has a br33ding k1nk or something. i feel so off knowing that he’d be so happy to knock me up but doesn’t even know me well enough yet to read my facial expression. 
for other context, he’s very sweet and takes care of me. he never lets me pay when the bill is dropped off at the table, orders, pays for and goes and gets my coffee to bring it to me each morning, buys me 2 dozens roses once or twice a week. he buys me the expensive makeup and jewelry that i’m always looking at, and is even trying to buy me the new apple watch for my bday next month as my gift. i had planned to buy it myself and was just asking him questions about how it works as he owns one. 
—> in the past, i have been in a toxic, abusive and controlling relationship. i have long since seeked therapy to work on myself, but, i feel like i can’t help but notice some commonalities between this relationship and my previous/ traumatizing one. i am a bit confused on if these are actually things in common (is him buying all this stuff a form of manipulation?) is real or am i just still so limited due to my prior relationship?

For honestly awhile now, I feel like one day I woke up,, and I was not fully digested from the day before- but I chose to eat something anyways.
Ever since I have felt undigested/overlapping like.. if that makes sense or as if I should wait for my stomach to empty/get hungry to eat again.
If I ate anything the bloating would be crazy..
So I tried to,, except three days not eating/“fasting” and I still wasn’t cleared out or physically hungry- bloating is significantly decreased.
So I went a little over a week without eating and my stomach went down p much to normal/flat,, but I had no hunger.
If I even DRINK something like water or coffee with ANY creams- I will become bloated (especially creamed coffee or a “digestible” liquid)
This has been pure misery and I have also lost weight even before I stopped eating completely.
I don’t know what else to do except wait to get hungry but I guess I fucked it up or something.
If anyone understands what I’m talking abt/going thru and u have any advice to restore my gut/stomach back to normal, I would greatly appreciate it.
This has been pure misery and depression.

My parents got me retractive orthodontics when I was a kid. When I bring up jaw surgery around my mom, she assures me that it's totally normal and inevitable that I can't breathe through my nose, because my father also can't breathe through his nose, to such an extent that he wouldn't kiss her much because he couldn't breathe. Wtf? Is that supposed to make me feel better? Roll over and accept an entire life of basically breathing through a coffee straw? I know jaw issues are NOT hereditary because I've extensively researched orthotropics, but she argues for genetics anyway. No curiosity, no desire to learn and change.

She doesn't even seem to believe that it will actually improve airway capacity. It seems like it's going to take me actually getting this surgery for her to realize it's better for me. And I'll have to fund it on my own. :( In the end I'm an adult and it's my body, but it sucks when the people who are supposed to be looking out for you, the very people responsible for making your face as messed up as it is, don't care or in fact push you *not* to get the surgery. The only people who seem to really understand this are others who have explored orthotropics and jaw surgery. Sometimes showing before and after pictures helps people to be a little more sympathetic, but then it appears to them like a frivolous cosmetic procedure rather than something that will hugely improve quality of life.

Cracked open an Oakshire Hellshire XIV tonight, their barrel aged imperial stout out of Eugene, Oregon. Poured it into a mason jar because it’s basically God’s Swiss Army cup. Works for coffee, whiskey, and if I don’t finish it, I can screw on the lid and call it “meal prep.”

This stuff pours like motor oil, thick and dark with no light getting through. The aroma hits with dark chocolate, bourbon, and a little oak. First sip brings a wave of fudge and roasted malt with that slow bourbon warmth that creeps up instead of burning.

As it warms, you start catching vanilla, oak, and a touch of cherry sweetness. For something sitting at 14.6 percent, it drinks way too smooth. You feel the strength but it doesn’t come off harsh.

Honestly, it’s one of the more balanced Hellshire releases I’ve had.

1o02xbv,https://i.redd.it/s1io5kzppltf1.png,Our Anniversary Gift His Secretary's Coffee,"Happy Anniversary""—Dahlia Rose orders coffee through her husband Zavier’s account, only to discover it was delivered to his secretary, Blaire. A receipt, a dismissive lie, and years of hidden betrayals later, Dahlia pulls out a divorce agreement—signed, sealed, and waiting for Zavier’s signature. But when Blaire flaunts their affair at the company’s anniversary party, Zavier warns Dahlia: ""One wrong move, and you’ll walk away with nothing.

# Chapter 1 - The Final Signature

On their wedding anniversary, Dahlia Rose used her husband's food delivery account to order two iced lattes—and had him foot the bill.

An hour later, his secretary, Blaire Evans, posted:

""Mr. Wheeler is unbelievable—I’m on a diet! How am I supposed to finish two iced lattes?""

Dahlia’s eyes flicked to the receipt, but Zavier Wheeler casually snatched his phone back.

""The app glitched earlier, so Blaire’s address defaulted. Now she’s stuck with two lattes—what a pain.""

Face blank, Dahlia turned and unlocked the safe behind her, Zavier’s dismissive tone still hanging in the air.

""You should’ve checked before ordering.""

As he spoke, she pulled out a document, signed the last page, and handed it to him.

Zavier’s expression iced over at ""Divorce Agreement.""

""Over a wrong address?""

""Over a wrong address,"" Dahlia confirmed without looking up.

Instead of taking it, Zavier scoffed and sprawled across the office couch.

""Dahlia, this was just PR when we married. My parents handed it to you as a formality—not for you to weaponize.""

The document was barely a few pages, but Zavier couldn’t be bothered to read it. To him, it had always been corporate theater.

Clutching the papers, Dahlia stepped forward.

""I’ve signed. You do the same, and we’re done.""

""Seriously? Over this?""

Five years with Zavier had taught her that edge in his voice—patience thinning.

""Let’s not pretend. You married for money. Who knows what strings you pulled? Without my parents forcing this, I wouldn’t have bothered. That agreement protected the Wheeler name—not you. Don’t flatter yourself.""

She almost laughed.

He had no idea she’d demanded that agreement as a condition.

He swatted at the papers.

""You’ll forgive employees for tanking projects but not one slip-up of mine?""

""One slip-up?""

Dahlia dodged his hand, her sudden laugh freezing him. His gaze sharpened as she flipped to the agreement’s first page.

""Five signatures needed. I decided: every twenty times I forgave you, I’d sign once. Five years covered all five.""

The first—their wedding night, Zavier at a bar, ""catching up with friends.""

The second—their first family visit, humiliating her publicly: ""They can arrange the marriage, not force me to love you.""

The seventieth—the day she gave birth, while he toasted his secretary’s new home.

...

Zavier thumbed through, pausing at the dried tearstain by the second signature. A beat later, he tossed the papers aside.

""It’s just coffee. Want some? I’ll have it delivered now—ten times the fee, someone’ll take it.""

Dahlia pushed the agreement toward him, voice steady.

# Chapter 2 - A Cruel Anniversary Ultimatum

A knock came at the door as Zavier Wheeler straightened his collar and tossed the divorce papers into Dahlia Rose's hands, his eyes glinting with warning.

""This year’s annual meeting is key to securing my inheritance. Don’t embarrass me in front of the staff. One wrong move, and I’ll sign these papers—you’ll walk away with nothing.""

He paused, lips twisting into a mocking smirk.

""Face it, without me, you couldn’t even afford a cup of coffee. Keep your mouth shut, or even the Wheelers won’t be able to save you from the fallout.""

Before Dahlia could respond, the door swung open. The HR Director entered, wheeling in an elaborate five-tier cake.

Did he actually remember our anniversary?

Instinctively, Dahlia tucked the divorce papers behind her back, refusing to become office gossip.

Zavier tensed, irritation flashing across his face.

""Blaire’s off today. Why schedule a birthday party now?""

The employees froze, eyes darting between Dahlia’s pale face and Zavier’s scowl. Whispers erupted.

""Blaire still comes first, huh?""

""Does Mrs. Wheeler know about them?""

""Like I always said—cross Blaire, and you’re done.""

The HR Director cleared his throat.

""Sir, this isn’t the monthly birthday. It’s for the company’s fifth anniversary. Since today’s also your wedding anniversary, we thought we’d celebrate with Mrs. Wheeler while she’s here...""

Zavier’s brow furrowed, a flicker of guilt crossing his face. His voice wavered.

""Oh. Right.""

An intern piped up, grinning:

""Mr. Wheeler, those limited-edition figurines you asked about last month—were they for Mrs. Wheeler’s gift? That $200K set must be incredible!""

Another voice chimed in:

""Funny, Blaire posted one last week. Wouldn’t even let us near it. Maybe Mrs. Wheeler can show us?""

Zavier shifted uncomfortably. The intern’s manager yanked her back.

""That’s their private matter. Focus on celebrating the company—it’s their love story, after all!""

Blaire Evans’ voice drifted in from the doorway.

""What’s all this? Cake and coffee?""

She strolled in, ignoring the crowd, and nudged Zavier’s chest playfully.

""Oops. Mrs. Wheeler must’ve forgotten—I only drink half-sweet.""

With a sly glance at Dahlia, Blaire pressed a lipstick-stained coffee cup into Zavier’s hands.

""Since these were a mistake, you can have them back.""

She shifted deliberately, flaunting the designer figurine hanging from her purse.

""Almost ruined the birthday present Mr. Wheeler gave me!""

Gasps filled the room. All eyes locked on Dahlia.

Zavier started to dismiss them, but Dahlia’s voice cut through, ice-clear:

""Sign the papers.""

Blaire’s smirk vanished behind a mask of faux sympathy.

1o02wwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1o02wwr/anyone_have_any_stories_in_memory_of_their_late/,Anyone have any stories in memory of their late grandparents ( rip ),"Any stories at all even if they havent passed on.

My Grandad passed away on the beginning of December 2021. Now that i think about it i cant believe its been 4 years. 

When he was a younger man he was abusive, very. I get told he did used to beat my dad and uncles, and especially my grandmother. Stories endless one time he smashd a mirror in her face. It shocked me.

But my grandad was this hero and role model for me as a kid i was nurtured by him out of all his grandchildren the most. 

Every time he’d come he would bring me cars and toys. I remember he’d have a tobacco pipe and when id lie on his shoulder he’d smoke and tell me to sit on the edge of the sofa until hes done, and he’d give me an empty medicine bottle to play with and pop open and close. That smell of the empty med tub i still remember. 

He had those sugar pills you put in tea and coffee ifykyk he’d let me press the button every time even if it was such a small thing.

Even though he had an abusive past, he never ever ever ever looked at me in anger or frustration or shouted at me i have no bad memories of him genuinely. He always smiled, he always taught me lessons.

When my dad wasnt there, HE taught me how to ride my first bike, he bought my first bike, he bought me my first car, he fed my love for things like engines and cars and sports and riding bikes. 

For his children it wouldnt have been like that.

It makes me think how even the most complicated and roughest of men change as they grow. 

He was the elder of the family everyone looked up to him, i know he was stern and rigid when he needed in terms of family matters but he never showed that side to me.

Him and my grandmother whos my life and heart were divorced and seperated for decades. They still saw eachother at family gatherings often. Family road trips and holidays and at family house visits theyd be in the same room, but never speak to eachother. I have a very very faint memory not sure if its even a real memory of them talking for a split second which is so weird. 

Even though my grandma is my whole life the one person i love most, i could never see my granddad as a bad person.

Some of my granddads final words and requests were: “ Ask her to forgive me “ to my father. 

I was young i mean i couldnt process it i guess i had never lost anyone before i didnt know how it felt so i was in shock.

Literally my uncle tried to cheer me up with supercars and all that stuff but i just couldnt register anything.

Its only now i realise eveything deeply, how everytime he came, taking me to get food with him from a takeaway wasnt him feeling hungry or wanting to treat me, it was NEVER ABOUT THE FOOD. He wanted me to remember who my grandfather was and enjoy the time together. 

I forever love and miss my grandad and im sorry for not appreciating everything he did for me while he was still here.

1o02vca,https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/comments/1o02vca/am_i_asking_too_much_or_do_i_have_the_right_to/,"Am I asking too much, or do I have the right to feel like he's only loving me when it's convenient?","I don't want to write this, but after several conversations that ALWAYS turn into arguments where he feels defensive or attacked, I don't know what to do...

I’m in a long-distance relationship, officially about 4 months, but we started talking the beginning of this year when I was happily single. For context, I (34F) was in a relationship for 5yrs prior where I didn't get my emotional needs met. I took time to go to therapy and work on my own happiness. I made it very clear to him that I didn't want to be in a relationship that made me feel any less peaceful or happy that I could make myself. I set my standards and communicated them clearly. He (38M) was very persistent that he wanted the same type of relationship and could be that. I even told him I'm okay waiting until I move next year, but again, he was very confident that it's what he wanted.

In the very beginning, he was thoughtful with little surprises that made me feel seen. Photo gifts, always wanting to take pictures, a sweet letter, always had undivided attention when we would FaceTime, he loved us having deep long conversations and reading...

But over the last few months, I noticed that dwindling significantly. It started small so I tried not to overthink especially cause he had a new job. But it was visible enough where conversations started to be surface level unless I tried to bring something up, but even then the effort wasn't really there to reciprocate.

 I’ve tried to share feelings of emotional disconnection and wanting us to grow together on an emotional and romantic level and I want to feel special like he would tell me he wants me to feel. Even when I preface things kindly, he often takes it as me saying he’s not doing enough. After one conversation turned into an argument, he sent me a heartfelt message about wanting to “love me better, not just with intention but with action,” which meant a lot to me because that’s exactly what I need. But when I would ask how or what that meant to him, he would say he doesn't know and needs time to process... but then never initiates bringing it back up. So I’m struggling with whether his actions match his words.

For example: there was a product drop I was so excited about as I waited for years. I sent him links, made it clear how much it meant, and thought he’d surprise me. He didn’t. A few weeks went by so I ended up buying them for myself and when I shared that i had bought some, my boyfriend’s reaction was supportive like ""Aw that's good. I'm glad!"" but very surface-level and not once said ""I was going to get you one""

Another example: when he visited recently, he offered to help me clean up and said he wanted to ease my stress because he knew how much I had going on. When he asked me what he could do, I gave him a couple of small, specific tasks... He then asked if I could text him a list. I obliged, but was a little dissapointed that it felt like i had to write things down like a chore. He had hours free while I was at work, but instead he napped, went to the gym, and got himself snacks. He picked me up later, smiled, and said, “Don’t be mad, I didn’t do what you asked, but it’s fine, we’ll do it together later.” I felt sad — not because of the undone tasks, but because he’d offered, knew how stressed I was, and then brushed it off. I started to cry in silence and asked him to give me a minute. I didn't blow up or yell or get mad. I calmly tried to explain my feelings and how it hurt that even when I make it convenient, it felt like he took advantage of me being understanding even though he made me feel so safe that he would want to help me.. He got defensive and it escalated into him blurting out that maybe we should just go our separate ways after the trip since he’s “not doing enough.” I went outside to take a breath and he apologized and said he didn't want to, and wanted to make me happy.

And here’s the part that really confuses me: one time he even asked me, “If I asked you to buy me X, would you do it?” I said yes, I would. He didn’t end up asking, but over several days he kept saying, “Dang, I keep forgetting to buy X” and “Ugh, I really need X.” What he didn’t know was that I had already shipped it the day he wondered if i would. When it arrived, I asked him, “When you kept hinting, were you hoping I’d just buy it without you asking?” He sheepishly said, “Yeah, I did. Thank you, babe.” So he clearly appreciates thoughtfulness when it comes from me.

For context, he does show care in practical ways — like ordering me food or coffee on DoorDash — but it’s always after asking me exactly what I want and having me send a link. It’s never a surprise or anticipation. Meanwhile, I tend to send him things he needs or surprise him without asking. I've sent him hand written cards, his favorite snacks, pratical home things that he's complained about having to get, I give him advice and truly listen on just about everything he talks about.

I've brought it up in several ways. And he keeps saying he will process and talk to me but then when I check a few weeks later, he says he forgets and gets defensive as if im being mean to ask where he's at or if he's thought about our conversation. Now its to a point where he says we argue all the time and I keep ""bringing things up from the past"" and I feel so confused because the only reason things keep coming up is because he won't communicate with me and seems to expect me to just forget? He sends me short loving texts, talks to me often..etc. 

I can’t tell if I’m expecting too much. Am I asking too much by wanting more thoughtfulness, follow-through, and initiative from him, or is this a reasonable need in a relationship? I'm at a point where I'm so confused because he's so sweet with saying he loves me, and is thinking of me and hopes I have a good day and wants to talk every day but I can't think of a time he was romantic without being prompted. Like sending me something just because that wasnt initiated by me specifically asking or when we argue...

But again, he sends me food and coffee so should I just be grateful for that?

I've never been in an LDR, so I guess i wonder what is reasonable to expect.",2,1759804195.0,LDR,1,1.0,False

In highschool I used to fall asleep alot of the time. To the point where I was basically made to stand in the class right after lunch because I would just..... knock out cold. 


I would drink like celcius and keep instant coffee in my locker to stay awake but it would only work for like 3 hours.


Anyways, that's like fine and I can cope with it, and if I get tired at work I just stand and drink coffee before my shift. 


Its getting kind of absurd. Im usually tired but this is like so much worse than my normal. 


Im considering going to a doctor but im worried im going to get brushed off. I have tried everything I can think of, though. Magnesium supplements, cutting out caffine, more caffine, multivitamins. All my bloodwork comes back fine, and I have mild anemia. 


I have Ehlers-danlos syndrome, sucrose deficiency, anxiety, and depression. I dont want to go to the doctor if its just like depression because I can talk to my therapist about it. 


I sleep abt 8 hours minimum every day (more like 10-12 right now, I feel like i cant function below that), I dont go on my phone much (I do sometimes, but I dont usually) when I try to go to sleep.


Im normal weight and height (5'6 and 155 lbs). I eat well and splurge on treats very little. I am a server so I am active at my job. I've always been a night owl, but I gave waking up at like 8am and going to bed at 12am a try for a few weeks with 0 improvement. Im on zoloft and testosterone (testosterone started in september).

I'm a decade older than Sebastian. The first time I laid eyes on him, he was a scrawny street rat, fighting mutts for whatever scraps he could find.

His stare, raw and wild, was pure wolf.

So, I scooped him up. Molded him from the ground up.

Ten years. That’s all it took for Sebastian to morph from a gutter rat into the city’s golden boy, its most sought-after CEO.

For the longest time, I genuinely believed Sebastian was my masterpiece.

Until that fateful day. A bratty little girl, smug as you please, stopped my ride.

She casually placed a hand on her swollen belly, hit play on a recorder, and asked, “Sebastian, who do you like more—me or that old hag?”

Then, a voice I knew way too well, dripping with disdain: “Just some aging woman. All these years, what I’ve loathed most is her condescending attitude.”

A smile played on my lips. Looks like Sebastian had conveniently forgotten his days of begging like a stray.

The next day, a gift-wrapped box arrived on his doorstep. Inside? A bloody, lifeless fetus.

His eyes blazed, pure inferno. A gun found its way to my forehead. He snarled each word like a curse, “Lilith.”

I took a slow sip of my coffee, cool as ice. “Seems Mr. Lawrence has a memory lapse regarding my… methods.”

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, his voice a low growl. “You think I won’t pull the trigger?”

He wasn’t that pathetic waif anymore. Those years clawing their way to the top had chiseled him into something sharp and dangerous.

I just gave him a little shake of my head, a faint smile still on my face. “If I were you, I wouldn’t waste breath on threats.”

Sebastian froze. Then, a whisper of sound from the floor-to-ceiling window behind him.

He spun around, his expression shattering.

There she was, dangling from the 72nd floor, hands bound, her white gown billowing like a tattered flag. A sheer drop to oblivion yawned beneath her.

“I’d be cautious if I were you,” I purred, the gun still a chilling pressure against my temple. “If your hand happens to slip and I’m gone, your little darling downstairs gets… well, pulverized. One life gone… only one now, though.”

The girl’s sobs were pathetic. “Sebastian, save me!”

His eyes, bloodshot and wild, finally flicked the safety catch. “Lilith, how dare you!”

My security detail moved in like shadows.

The air crackled with unspoken violence, a storm about to break.

But with a dismissive flick of my wrist, I waved them back. “Stand down.”

Then, without even looking, I drew a hidden dagger and plunged it deep into Sebastian’s gut.

He gasped, a guttural sound of pain, but the gun pressed harder against my skin.

“Enjoying yourself?” I murmured, my voice soft, intimate.

Sebastian’s face was a mask of pure ice. “Are you satisfied? Now let her go.”

# Chapter 2 - The Ghost of Eve

Amaya's different from you. She's just some innocent babe who knows zilch.

Sebastian's goons showed up faster than a speeding bullet and snatched Amaya.

Honestly, I never really meant to hurt her anyway.

Watching Sebastian coo sweet nothings to the girl cradled in his arms, like she was some delicate, priceless artifact, I just felt… meh. So over it.

He used to hold me like that too—right after our enemies ripped away our baby, leaving me barren forever.

That was a fully-baked baby girl, we'd named her Eve.

Sebastian went all out for Eve, dropping serious coin on a gold statue in her memory.

He told me, ""Lilith, our child will surely find peace in the afterlife.""

He wanted a never-ending parade of worshippers, all praying for Eve, stacking up blessings for her.

I asked him once, ""Why all the drama?""

Sebastian, looking like a homeless lumberjack but with pure grit in his eyes, said:

""Because Eve is the only kid I'm ever gonna get in this lifetime.""

Now, I'm staring at the gift box on Sebastian's desk.

Sebastian, you reneged on your word. But no sweat—I'll jog your memory.

When the girl finally stopped her waterworks, she glared at me, eyes puffy and radiating pure hate:

""Sebastian, it's her! That witch killed our baby!""

But Sebastian's face went dark.

He ran a hand through her hair, his voice eerily chill, ""You've gone too far.""

Amaya's sobs choked in her throat.

She had no clue that ever since we lost Eve, no one around us dared breathe a word about anything related to kids.

That pain? It's a ghost that'll forever haunt Sebastian and me.

Nobody spilled the tea to Amaya. She just kept wailing, her cries enough to shatter anyone's soul.

Sebastian scooped up her limp body, bulldozed past me, and stomped out.

""Lilith, I'll remember this."" I just never saw Sebastian's payback coming in hot and fast.

Listening to my subordinate's update, I absently stroked the cat on my lap.

""Mr. Lawrence outbid us, double the price for the southern estate.""

""Mr. Lawrence has been low-key chatting up shareholders, trying to snag their shares.""

""Mr. Lawrence… had the cathedral built for little Eve demolished.""

My grip tightened, and the cat let out a yelp of pain, curling into a ball of fear in my arms.

""Say that again?""

I kept my face blank.

My assistant gritted his teeth, ""Mr. Lawrence demolished the cathedral. He said he's gonna build an amusement park for that home-wrecker! Construction kicked off this morning!""

Crash!

I chucked the coffee cup next to me. It exploded into shards.

My assistant immediately bowed his head, ""I'll handle it right now!""

I raised my hand, ""I'll go myself.""

By the time I rolled up, half the cathedral was already rubble.

Amaya was clutching a balloon, bouncing around, barking orders at the workers:

""Clear that spot properly! And over here—Sebastian, I want a carousel right here!""

Does anyone have the Supreme or Elite? Could you please measure the max swing height? I’m hoping one of these models will work. I really don’t want anything smaller. 

Thanks in advance!!

My plan for our first club meeting was to show them some recipes, we do a ""coffee tasting"" of sorts(lol), we can come up with fun names for the drinks, but I'm not quite sure what else to do.

I feel like that's a pretty good first meeting, but I wanted to just put a post out here and see if people had any suggestions! Or even suggestions for things to make!

I’m the kind of person who enjoys small, quiet moments, coffee in the morning, random deep talks, but also loves concerts, night life and getting lost on hiking trails. I’m happiest when I’m out enjoying something new or surrounded by good music and good company.

I’m not great at this whole “meeting people online” thing, but I’d really like to find someone kind, funny, and down-to-earth. I’m not looking for anything rushed, just something real, where we can both be ourselves and see where it goes.

If you like cozy nights, bad jokes, and good conversation, we’ll probably get along just fine :))

Clearly, a miscalculation.

For some background we have 9 month old twin boys. No daycare so often she works evenings and we do a swap when I get home. Making ends meets scrapping by like most of America. 

Yesterday we had dinner at the inlaws and we got some good food and a nice meal with her family and happy birthday with Cake that I made and worms with dirt (pudding and gummies) she helped make the dessert  even when I tried to shoo her away. 

Anyway it's definitely hard as the entire time we also have to take care of our boys of course. Today was the birthday and I worked and then she had to work at night. Early before kids got up I went out to get her fancy coffee. I got one of the kids up and let her stay in bed. Started making her pancakes (the batter was spoiled so they came out flat at rubbery) then I had to start work, I'm remote.  During lunch break we opened gifts (I got her a etsy sweater and shirt) with a heartfelt card. She left after I got done to go to work and I took over with the kids for dinner/play/bedtime. 

She got home late from work and was upset because her birthday just felt very lame and not special. She wanted to be alone. Did I drop the ball or is this just how birthdays are when you have kids? We just don't have the money to do anything extravagant. Past birthdays I think I've tried to do more. So did I drop the ball and should I make this up to her or is this just a normal adjustment to parent life? ",1,1759803452.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Started on Meetup, recently moved to my own domain. This guy  attended once over a year ago, never came back, never gave feedback.

The moment he receives the first event notification from the new mailing list he replies TO THE MAILING LIST EMAIL (luck I saw it).

He critiques the group based on that one session from over a year ago (like too noisy, no structure, not intellectual enough), he some people were there for romance not philosophy (wtf?), he requests a private coffee meeting with me to discuss ""the purpose of the group and how it achieves that purpose"", and he also includes his full business signature as a Certified Practising Accountant with legal disclaimer, which seems like status signalling..

I replied firmly to him that the group is open format (it's all already on the website), and that I I don't meet privately with strangers to discuss how I run the group, but he's welcome to attend sessions like everyone else.

His response was to apologise for sending an ""obviously upsetting email"" (is this because I'm a woman?), then asks EVEN MORE questions, like is there a chairperson? How is discussion moderated? What are the rules? (sir, it's a book club at a cafe!) He then gives me an ultimatum that either we ""consult together"" on how I run things or he'll ""proceed to establish a forum for philosophical discussions"" himself, obviously to compete against mine. Then he requests a phone call with me AGAIN after I already declined.

I haven't responded to the second email.

I don't remember this person at all, maybe I was travelling when he attended. He's been on the mailing list for over a year doing nothing. But NOW that I've invested in a domain and legitimised the group more, suddenly he has opinions and demands. He's had literally years to start his own group if he wanted more structured philosophical discussion but he hasn't done anything. I'm the one who's started a group.

AITA for my reply? Is this guy overstepping?
