1jhpoil,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/1jhpoil/have_you_ever_thought_about_how_weird_names_are/,Have you ever thought about how weird names are?,"Names. If I, a completely stranger that has never met you, messaged you and read off your full name on your birth certificate, you would probably be freaking out and think I was up to no good, BUT what if we ran into each other at a coffee shop and introduced ourselves with our full legal names, but then I said your gamertag or your reddit username? I dont think you would be as freaked out, but you'd still probably be pretty freaked out as to how I got that information.

I met up with a friend from high school that I haven't seen in over a decade, and she was actually my girlfriend in high school's best friend (she, the friend,  kind of disappeared from our lives after we graduated), but it got the better of me so I just straight up asked her ""Have you heard from Jenna lately"" and she says ""Jenna? Who's that???"" And that actually confused me because, again, they were supposedly best friends throughout high school, so I was like ""Jenna? You know, that girl you were best friends with in high school?"" And no matter what I said she couldn't remember who Jenna was, so I dug up a photo of her on my phone and she was like ""OH, HER???"", and if turns out she freaking knew her as freaking ""Eowyn"" or ""Arwen"" because she was a huge Lord of the Rings fan, but that was actually something I DIDN'T knew because they would just refer to each other as ""Asia"" and ""Germa"" because the friend is asian and my girlfriend was of German heritage (and I would just refer to each other by their names), so there was a 3-way split in how everybody called everybody!!!!

My only question now is, so WTF did they refer to ME as????",1,1742698562.0,RandomThoughts,1,1.0,False
1jhpo8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1jhpo8l/i_lived_in_a_haunted_apartment_and_im_still/,I lived in a haunted apartment and I’m still recovering,"Putting a trigger warning on here because I talk about using substances/alcohol. 

I've been wanting to tell this story for a while but haven't really known how. Fair warning, this is going to be long, but shortened to the best of my ability. 

 I moved out of this apartment in a frenzy, almost two years ago now. I've had a lot of time to process it but still can't wrap my head around what happened there. I've tried looking up information about it, to see if any deaths ever occurred there, but couldn't find anything. Anyway. 

This was the first apartment I moved into on my own. I split the rent with my younger sister. I didn't notice anything weird with it at first. The rent was cheap. It was an old building and kind of dusty, but it had some new appliances and it was spacious. It even had an extra room which I could use as an art studio. New floors in the kitchen. Nice hardwood in the living room. Good location, it was right up the street from a nice park with a river. Overall, it seemed great. So we signed the lease and moved in the very next day. 

The first night I slept there, I didn't sleep well. Once again, though, nothing weird. I just wasn't used to the noise from the neighbors, and because I was dirt poor I didn't have a bed or curtains or anything, so it was uncomfortable. But normal. 

A few weeks in, I had gotten myself a mattress from Walmart and curtains to block out the street lights. I'd set up my art studio and found some more furniture, either secondhand or from relatives. The place began to feel like a home. That was when weird things started happening. 

First, it was small things that were easy to brush off. My sister said she could hear silverware clinking in the kitchen at night. Then she accused me of messing with her doorknob while she was trying to sleep. We chalked it up to vibrations from cars driving down the street, or the neighbors making noise. These small disturbances continued, but we thought nothing of it. 

I started to have trouble sleeping. I'd wake up several times throughout the night. At the time, I worked early mornings at a coffee shop, so sometimes I'd wake up at 3 or 4 in the morning and just stay up the rest of the night. There was no clear reason why I couldn't sleep. I'd just find myself waking up at odd hours wide awake. Eventually, it took a toll on me, and I started having a nightcap to knock me out each night. Usually just a glass of whiskey, straight. I never drank much before, but for some reason, it seemed like the best thing to do. It worked for a while. 

Meanwhile, my sister was also having trouble sleeping. She'd stay up late playing music too loudly, which caused friction between us. 

More friction: I got tips at my job which I kept in a coffee can in my room. Over time I noticed money missing. We also fought about her drinking my liquor, and then about her spilling alcohol all over the apartment, and then about me waking up in the middle of the night finding my bedroom door wide open and things moved around my room. 

I felt a need to protect myself somehow and leaned heavily into some kind of spirituality. I cleansed the apartment with sage often. I kept certain crystals in my pockets. I started seeing 444 repeatedly. None of this really did anything of course. But I felt a compulsive need to light the sage, to charge the crystals. Now, when I woke up at night, I'd walk down the street to the river and lay the crystals out on the rocks. I'd write 444 on a piece of paper and then burn it with a lighter and throw it in the river. I don't know why I did this. I also went on a lot of long walks to clear my head and get out of the apartment. I felt like the only time I could think clearly was when I wasn't in the building. 

As time went on, both me and my sister drank more and more heavily. There are many nights there that I don't remember. I'd be sober working in my studio having a glass of whiskey and would wake up in my bed soaked in vomit. The art I made was weird. A lot of gore. Watercolors. There's one of a snake coming out of woman's belly, and another of two women plucking out each other's eyeballs. There's one drawing of my sister that I tore up and made into a collage. The inspiration for these seemed to come in flashes. I'd get really strong visions and had to create them, all the while getting drunk out of my mind. I've tried to create more images in that art style now, but I physically just can't do it. 

I started getting terrible nightmares where I'd wake up sweating and screaming. Really horrific stuff. Some of them were reoccurring. One in particular was of the room next to me, my art studio, on fire. There was a blonde, middle-aged woman I saw a lot in these dreams, and she always looked cross. Not sad or even angry, but just very stern and almost disappointed. 

The whispers started maybe six months in. At night, while I was falling asleep, I'd hear these whispers. Sometimes they'd whisper my name. Often they said ""leave the body. Keep the body. Leave the body"" over and over again like that. 

Through all of this, I continued to see 444 a lot and tried to do yoga and meditate during the day. Here was the only time I had an out-of-body experience when meditating. I felt my whole body vibrating, and felt a pop? And then I felt like i was floating around the apartment and could float through it and see everything. My sister came into my room while this was happening and tried to talk to me but I couldn't respond to her. It felt like only a few minutes but when I came out of it I saw that over an hour had passed. 

Bad stuff happened in this apartment. My sister invited a boy over who she hooked up with and started dating, who eventually turned out to be very abusive to her. Other people she invited over always seemed to start these big, awful arguments. One of these people broke the window to the front door. We had to call the police a few times because people got violent. I invited my best friend over one night. I never had romantic feelings for her, but for some reason, she and I hooked up, started dating, and things ended between us very badly. But before we broke up, I spent days at a time at her place. Whenever I returned to the apartment I felt terrible, sick, and my skin felt itchy almost like I was allergic to it. I also felt inexplicably on edge and irritated. I took allergy medicine for a while thinking I had a dust allergy, but it didn't help anything. The only thing that helped was not being there, and not sleeping there. It got to the point where I was afraid to go to sleep at night because of the whispers and the nightmares. The drinking certainly didn't help things, but when I was there, all I wanted to do was drink and dissociate as much as possible. 

I struggled with depression, and it got very bad during this time. After my ex and I broke up, I couldn't stand to stay in that apartment any longer, so I left, and moved 40 minutes away to a new town. I sleep soundly in my new place. But that old apartment shifted something in me. I started getting flashbacks from something traumatic that happened to me as a child, and I checked myself into a hospital and stayed there ten days. 

----

I know this is long and weird, but there's more to add. I have two other siblings aside from the one I shared the apartment with, and they all lived there at one point or another. Each one of them started using alcohol or other substances heavily, and each one reported feeling a sense of unease there. Basically, staying there made us all crash out. I can't help but feel like something paranormal was at play. 

Now, we are all moved out of there for good. I don't drink often anymore, but when I do, I don't drink whiskey. All of us are much more stable now. My depression is under control and I don't have many nightmares or flashbacks. I am still recovering from all the money I lost there, either from buying alcohol or my sister stealing from me or from not ever getting my double security deposit back...

I am, however, writing this because last night I dreamt about those awful whispers, and woke myself up screaming.
I am here in my ""new"" place and I feel safe, but god... I never want to experience anything like that ever again. I felt like a different version of myself then, something I never want to see again for as long as I live. Like I said, some of it I don't even remember very well. There was something very, very wrong about that place. But somehow I feel a weird sort of attachment to it, like a toxic relationship or something. It's bizarre.

I still don't know if it was my mental illness or something else. I will say that as soon as we all moved out, new tenant moved in, but the place went back up for rent just a few months later. All I can say is good luck to whoever moves in there next. That place is cursed.

My uncle had to pay our utilities or else we wouldn’t have power, water or gas right now and yesterday our internet was shut off. Now, I need the internet for school and for my online job. I don’t earn much money, but I do earn some money through twitch and YouTube, but I just got monetized on YouTube, so there’s no revenue on there and I didn’t have enough to pay it with my Twitch money. Also, incase you’re wondering, I had a job, she was my ride because I was getting a job to get a car, I was paying for gas, she wasted the gas and I didn’t have money to put in the tank, so that caused me to lose my job. Now, going back to yesterday when the internet got shut off, my phone bill is also connected to the internet, but it’s also separate, both are through spectrum, but the cable and internet is a separate bill from my phone bill. Yesterday the internet got shut off in the middle of the day, while I was working on videos, no warning, nothing, it was just turned off. I check the account and it says it’s past due, keep in mind, I allowed her to get a loan on my Nintendo switch to pay for the cable and internet bill. But she didn’t put it on my debit card to pay for it, no, she decided to get BIGGBY coffee with it stating that she was going to pay for it the next day. Well, the next day rolled around, she got home from work, she wasn’t able to pull money from her earnings from daily pay and it wasn’t paid. The internet was shut off and ever since then, I’ve been irritated because my job relies on the internet and I gave her a solution and she didn’t do what I told her to do. Now, I’m pissed because there’s no internet and if it’s not paid by the middle of next week, I won’t have phone service either. I had to go to Walmart to get to WiFi to deal with copyright claims on my videos so I could turn on monetization on those videos, she got sick of sitting there, forced me to go in with her. I told her you wouldn’t have to sit in Walmart parking lot if you would’ve just paid for the internet, she got pissed off at me. She told me in the store that I needed to get a job to pay for it and she almost left me in the store and drove off in the car. I luckily am young enough that I was able to catch up to her or else, I’d be sitting in Walmarts parking lot right now waiting for my uncle to get off work at 11. I plan to move out in a couple of months once I get some money, but right now, my hands are tied. ",2,1742698471.0,entitledparents,0,1.0,False

I am not into really floral or fruity coffees in general, and want something to contrast to the 078 (wehich I do like). IOW, is there a burr set that will fit and work reasonably well in one of my Odes, that offers a more balanced, more body-focused flavor profile, but that does not kill the sasting notes.

EXT. PANAJI STREETS – NIGHT



The city hums in the dark—streetlights flicker, waves lap against the shore. A humid breeze rustles the palm fronds. Goa never truly sleeps.



A scooter glides through the quiet streets, its headlight carving a narrow path. Devkar rides, his hands steady on the handlebars. His eyes flick between the road and the shadows beyond it.



His voice, calm and measured, fills the night.



DEVKAR (V.O.)



""Tonight’s the night.""



He weaves through narrow lanes, passing old Portuguese villas, their balconies draped in bougainvillea. A dog watches him from a stoop, unblinking.



DEVKAR (V.O.)



""And it’s going to happen again. And again.""



He turns onto a deserted stretch along the Sal River, streetlights reflecting in the slow-moving water. A few fishing boats bob in the distance.



DEVKAR (V.O.)



""This is what I am. This is what I do.""



He slows the scooter near a small, weathered house. The sound of a scooter engine idling can be heard nearby. Another scooter—parked just inside the gate.



Devkar watches.



The front door opens, and a man steps out. DOMNIC D’SOUZA—mid-50s, thin, always smiling. He hums a Konkani hymn, locking the gate behind him.



DEVKAR (V.O.)



""Predators don’t hunt in the jungle. They hunt no one  suspects ... where trust runs deep ... where no one is watching.""



Beat.



""Except me.""



Domnic mounts his scooter. The engine purrs to life. Devkar’s eyes flick to the license plate—burning it into memory.



As Domnic rides away, Devkar follows, his own scooter purring in the night, shadowing him like a ghost.



\---

EXT. NARROW GOAN ROAD – NIGHT



Devkar follows Domnic’s scooter at a careful distance, his headlight dimmed just enough to blend into the night. The road curves along the river, the water shimmering under the moonlight.



Domnic rides slow, unbothered, a man with nothing to fear.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""They trust him. The church treasurer. The helpful uncle. The kind neighbor. A man of faith, they say.""



The scooter wobbles slightly as Domnic scratches his chin. He adjusts his rearview mirror but never looks back.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""They don’t see what I see.""



Devkar’s grip on the handlebars tightens.



\---



EXT. DOMNIC’S HOUSE – NIGHT



A single-story home with cracked white paint. A wooden cross hangs above the door, the metal dull with age. Domnic pulls into the driveway, humming to himself.



Devkar is already inside.



The room is neat. Too neat. The kind of careful organization that hides secrets. The faint scent of saline lingers in the air.



Domnic doesn’t notice.



He locks the door. Kicks off his shoes. He hums a little louder now, the same hymn, comforted by routine.



Then—he stops.



he hears something behind him and barely turns before—snap—the attack happens.



DEVKAR (O.S.)  

""Hello domnic"" 



Domnic turns.



A beat.



Domnic’s breath quickens. The hymn he was humming—now trapped in his throat.



The sound of duct tape tearing.



\---



INT. DOMNIC’S HOUSE – LATER



Domnic is tied to a rusted chair, his wrists bound tight. He thrashes weakly. The Sal leaf envelope is now stuffed into his mouth, sealed shut with tape.



Devkar stands over him, calm. Surgical. Efficient.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""I don’t believe in God. Or sin. Or redemption.



""Nature doesn’t forgive.""



""It only corrects.""



A gloved hand. A thin scalpel. The first cut.



Blood pools. A single drop falls into a tiny glass vial.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""And I am nature’s hand.""



A moment of stillness.



Then—darkness.



\---



INT. DEVKAR’S FLAT – MORNING



Sunlight creeps through the slatted window. A slow, golden invasion.



Devkar stands in front of his bathroom mirror, dragging a razor down his jaw with clinical precision. His face is blank. Unreadable.



The walls are bare except for a shelf lined with pinned insects—catalogued, labeled, arranged. A quiet obsession.



Outside, the city stirs. The smell of chai and warm bread drifts through the air. A distant a regional song plays on a radio.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""By day, I am invisible.A quiet presence, unnoticed, unremarkable ""



He pulls on his Goa Forensics Bureau ID badge. Another mask. Another role.



""The living walk past me without ever seeing.""



He pockets his keys. Leaves the flat.



The streets are alive now. Fishermen haul in their morning catch. Tourists fumble with maps. A group of boys laugh over cups of cutting chai.



Devkar walks through them all, unseen.



\---



INT. GOA FORENSICS BUREAU – MORNING



The hum of the lab. Glass beakers clinking. A centrifuge whirring.



Devkar moves through it with practiced ease, checking slides under a microscope, cataloging insect larvae.



Carlos D’Cruz leans against the counter, watching.



CARLOS  

""You ever think maybe you work too hard, man? Always in here with your bugs, your crime scenes, your… whatever this is.""



He gestures at the microscope. Devkar tilts his head slightly, as if considering it.



DEVKAR  

""It’s my job.""



Carlos laughs.



CARLOS  

""No, it’s an obsession.""



He leans in conspiratorially.



CARLOS  

""You know what you need? Some La Passion.""



Devkar blinks, processing.



DEVKAR  

""La Passion?""



CARLOS  

""yes. My friend in Miami swears by it. Says that’s the secret to life—La Passion. Find what sets your soul on fire... we met on facebook a few months ago""



He gestures dramatically, as if revealing the meaning of life. Devkar watches, impassive.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""friend from miami ? Carlos intrigues me sometimes.""



Carlos slaps the table.



CARLOS  

""You? You got no La Passion, man. You need something outside of work. Go out, drink, meet someone. You ever just… live?""



Devkar fakes a small, polite smile.



DEVKAR  

""I live.""



Carlos laughs.



CARLOS  

""No Devkar You.... just exist.""



He points at Devkar’s microscope.



CARLOS  

""That? That’s not life. That’s… staring at dead things.""



Devkar lowers his gaze, adjusting a slide.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""He’s right. I stare at the dead. I understand them. Because I am one of them.""



Carlos sighs, clapping Devkar on the back.



CARLOS  

""Alright, suit yourself. But one day, you’re gonna wake up and realize you need more than bugs and bodies.""



He starts to walk off when Devkar speaks.



DEVKAR  

""Acutally.. I have a date with Aisha tonight.""



Carlos stops, turning back with a raised eyebrow.



CARLOS  

""You? A date?""



DEVKAR  

""That’s the plan.""



Carlos nods, taking another sip of his coffee.



CARLOS  

""Alright. But don't forget La passion.""



He walks off, shaking his head. Devkar watches him go, his polite smile fading instantly.



DEVKAR (V.O.)

""Some men chase fire. Others keep it contained.""



His eyes drift to the crime scene board—fingers wrapped in red thread. The Aguada Ripper.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""But not everyone does.""



\---

INT. GOA POLICE BUREAU – FORENSIC LAB – NIGHT



The room is dimly lit, bathed in the glow of computer monitors. The faint hum of the A/C and the distant chatter of officers create a quiet backdrop.



Devkar sits at his desk, fingers tapping idly against the keyboard. The screen in front of him displays case files. His expression is unreadable.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

The world has rules. Laws. They are supposed to keep the worst of us in check. But what happens when the worst of us know how to slip through the cracks?



He leans forward, typing in a name:



ROHAN KAMAT



A mugshot appears. A grinning man, tattooed hand, a scar cutting across his brow. Gang leader. Drug trafficking. Extortion.



And homicide.



Four counts. Two witnesses disappeared before trial. The case was thrown out.



Devkar’s jaw tightens. His eyes flick over the records. Police reports. Photos of bodies found gutted in a warehouse. The kind of butchery that doesn’t come from necessity, but from pleasure.



He tilts his head slightly.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

Not all predators are the same. Some kill for control. Some kill for power. And then, there are those like me.



He opens another tab—a surveillance report.



Kamat’s last known location: A private villa in Anjuna. A fortress. Well-guarded. But not impossible.



Devkar’s fingers hover over the keyboard. Calculating.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

The Code is simple. He preys on the innocent. He walks free. That means he belongs to me.



A faint smirk tugs at his lips as he clicks the monitor off.



He has everything he needs.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

Tomorrow, I begin.



\---



INT. GOA FORENSICS BUREAU – LATE AFTERNOON



The crime lab buzzes with low conversation and faint music playing from someone’s phone. The faint smell of disinfectant and coffee lingers.



Devkar is at his station, methodically labeling a sample vial when the Lieutenant steps in.



INTRODUCING THE LIEUTENANT



The Lieutenant—Madhav Naik, mid-50s, composed, sharp-eyed—walks in holding a case file. His presence commands attention.



MADHAV  

""Devkar, you got a minute?""



Devkar straightens, nodding.



MADHAV  

""We’ve got another body near the Sal River. Need you there first thing tomorrow. Some fresh samples might still be viable.""



Devkar already knows the case. The Aguada Ripper.



DEVKAR  

""I’ll be there.""



Madhav narrows his eyes.



MADHAV  

""You’re leaving early today?""



DEVKAR  

""Yes.""



A pause.



MADHAV  

""Taking a day off? That’s new.""



Devkar doesn’t react. Madhav studies him a moment longer, then nods.



MADHAV  

""Hell must’ve frozen over. You, taking a personal day?""



He walks off, flipping through the case file.



\---



INT. FORENSICS BUREAU – BREAK ROOM



INTRODUCING DEVKAR’S SISTER



Devkar pours himself a cup of black coffee, only to have a slim brown hand swipe the mug away.



SAMEERA DEVKAR, mid-30s, bold, sarcastic, his older sister. She takes a sip of his coffee, unimpressed.



SAMEERA  

""Still drinking this garbage?""



Devkar watches her with mild disinterest.



DEVKAR  

""You didn’t have to steal it to find out.""



Sameera smirks, leaning on the counter.



SAMEERA  

""You never take time off. So… what’s her name?""



Devkar doesn’t blink.



DEVKAR  

""Who?""



SAMEERA  

""The reason you’re leaving before sunset.""



Devkar stares. Sameera grins, nudging his arm.



SAMEERA  

""Since when do you take personal days? Secret girlfriend?""



DEVKAR  

""I have things to do.""



Sameera hums, unconvinced.



SAMEERA  

""Sure. 'Things.'""



She sips the rest of his coffee, then walks off with a knowing smile.

INT. FORENSICS LAB – DEVKAR’S WORKSTATION



INTRODUCING OUR VERSION OF MASUKA



At his desk, Anay Borkar—early 40s, loud, flirtatious, always joking—leans back in his chair, scrolling through his phone.



ANAY  

""Hey, bro. You ever see a crab with two heads?""



Devkar ignores him.



ANAY  

""No, seriously, look at this. Science is wild, man.""



Devkar looks just enough to register it. A mildly disturbing picture of a deformed crab. He nods once.



DEVKAR  

""Interesting.""



ANAY  

""That’s it? No 'holy shit, Anay, that’s insane'?""



DEVKAR  

""I need you to cover for me.""



Anay raises an eyebrow.



ANAY  

""You? Skipping work? Should I be worried?""



DEVKAR  

""Only if you say no.""



Anay grins, dramatically tipping an imaginary hat.



ANAY  

""Anything for my dear, mysterious friend. But you owe me one. I want first dibs on the next weird corpse.""



Devkar doesn’t humor him with a response.



\---



INT. FORENSICS LAB – HALLWAY



As Devkar heads toward the exit, he almost collides with Sub-Inspector Adil Patil, mid-40s, intense, skeptical—their version of Doakes.



ADIL  

""Where are you going, Devkar?""



Devkar stops.



DEVKAR  

""Home.""



Adil doesn’t believe that for a second.



ADIL  

""Funny. There’s a fresh case, and you’re skipping out early?""



DEVKAR  

""I’ll be there in the morning.""



Adil studies him. His gaze hard, sharp.



ADIL  

""You’re always around dead bodies, Devkar. But every time I see you walk out of here, you look like you don’t have a life at all.""



Devkar doesn’t flinch.



DEVKAR  

""That’s because I don’t.""



Adil watches him go.



A long, lingering stare.



\---



EXT. STREETS OF PANJIM – EVENING



Devkar’s scooter weaves through narrow streets, passing old churches, neon-lit taverns, and shadowed alleyways.



His face remains neutral. Detached.



But something about the evening unnerves him.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""Carlos tells me I should live. Sameera thinks I already am. Adil believes I have no life at all.""



""They’re all wrong.""



He stops at a red light. Watches couples walking together, laughing, holding hands.



A strange thought flickers.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""And maybe… they’re right.""



The light turns green. Devkar rides forward.



To Aisha.



\---



EXT. CAFÉ TERRACE – EVENING



A quiet café along the Road. The warm glow of string lights. The murmur of the Cricket T20 match  in the background.



Aisha sits at an  table, absentmindedly stirring her tea. Her purple glasses catch the dim light as she glances at her phone.



Across the street, Devkar parks his scooter.



He takes a breath. Adjusts his sleeves. Steps inside.



\---



INT. CAFÉ – CONTINUOUS



Aisha looks up as Devkar approaches. Her face softens into a small, knowing smile.



AISHA  

""Let me guess. You forgot about our date ?""



Devkar nods once.



DEVKAR  

""No. Its just work. ""



He pulls out the chair across from her. He notices the untouched plate of something sweet in front of her.



DEVKAR  

""You ordered bebinca.""



AISHA  

""I thought you might like it.""



She gestures at it.



AISHA  

""Or, you know… at least pretend to.""



Devkar picks up the fork. Takes a measured bite.



Chews. Swallows.



DEVKAR  

""It’s good.""



Aisha leans in slightly, amused.



AISHA  

""Is it?""



Devkar considers. Honesty tugs at him.



DEVKAR  

""I don’t really know.""



Aisha chuckles.



AISHA  

""Still bad at lying, I see.""



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""She sees through me. That should make me uneasy.""



""But it doesn’t.""



He sets the fork down. Her presence is… different.



\---

INT. CAFÉ – CONTINUOUS



Aisha studies Devkar for a beat, eyes searching.



AISHA  

""You don’t have to do that, you know.""



Devkar tilts his head slightly.



DEVKAR  

""Do what?""



AISHA  

""Pretend.""



She rests her chin on one hand, tapping her fingers lightly against her cheek.



AISHA  

""You could’ve just said you don’t like sweets.""



Devkar considers this. Most people don’t offer him that kind of leeway. They expect politeness. He gives it to them.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""She doesn’t ask for the mask. Just me. Whatever that is.""



He shifts slightly in his seat, fingers tapping against the table.



DEVKAR  

""You ordered it for me.""



AISHA  

""I ordered it because I like it. And I hoped you'd share it.""



She nudges the plate toward him again, a small gesture, but there’s warmth in it. Devkar doesn’t understand warmth, but he recognizes something intentional about it.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""People bond over things like this. Small gestures. Shared moments. I study them, but she… she just does them.""



He glances at her hands—no rings, but faint indentations where one used to be.



DEVKAR  

""How are the kids?""



Aisha smiles, tired but genuine.



AISHA  

""Neel won his cricket match. Tara’s obsessed with painting now. Keeps stealing my dupattas to use as smocks.""



Devkar nods slightly. He doesn’t fully understand why she tells him these things, but he listens.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""She has a life. Full. Complicated. Messy. And yet, she’s here.""



She leans back, crossing her arms.



AISHA  

""And you? You ever think about taking a break? Maybe… existing outside of dead bodies and insect larvae?""



Devkar lets out the smallest exhale—not quite a laugh, but close.



DEVKAR  

""According to Carlos, I don’t even exist properly.""



Aisha chuckles.



AISHA  

""He’s not wrong.""



She watches him, expression softening.



AISHA  

""I don’t know how you do it. The things you see. The weight of it.""



She pauses, as if choosing her next words carefully.



AISHA  

""It doesn’t… stay with you?""



It does. Just not in the way she thinks.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""She carries grief like a scar. Visible. Felt. She lets it shape her, but not define her.""



""I carry mine differently.""



He lifts his cup, stirs the tea, watching the liquid swirl.



DEVKAR  

""It stays.""



Aisha doesn’t press.



Instead, she reaches for her own cup. A quiet understanding passes between them.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""Pain doesn’t connect people. Not really. But survival does.""



""She chose to keep living. To raise her children. To be kind. To love.""



""I didn’t choose anything. I just… am.""



Aisha smiles softly.



AISHA  

""You should let yourself enjoy something once in a while.""



Devkar holds her gaze.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""I do.""



""It’s just not what you’d expect.""



His phone buzzes on the table. He glances at it.



NEW CRIME SCENE.



Aisha sees the look in his eyes and already knows.



AISHA  

""Go.""



No frustration. No expectation. Just understanding.



Devkar hesitates—an unfamiliar feeling. Then, he nods.



He stands, pauses for just a second, then walks away.



Aisha watches him , then turns back to her tea, stirring absentmindedly.



as he is slipping his phone into his pocket. Aisha watches him with raised eyebrows.



AISHA  

""You’re just gonna leave me here, huh?""



Devkar pauses, confused.



DEVKAR  

""You told me to go.""



Aisha sighs, shaking her head with exaggerated disappointment.



AISHA  

""Men. So literal.""



She leans forward, eyes glinting.



AISHA  

""At least pay for my tea, forensic expert. Consider it a tax for abandoning me mid-sip.""



Devkar tilts his head.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""An arbitrary request. Money doesn’t matter. But she expects this—a normal exchange. A balance maintained.""



He pulls out his wallet and drops a few notes on the table. Aisha smirks.



AISHA  

""And for emotional damages?""



Devkar considers her for a moment, then pushes an extra bill toward her.



DEVKAR  

""That should cover it.""



Aisha laughs, shaking her head.



AISHA  

""Unbelievable.""



Devkar almost smiles, then turns to leave.



AISHA (calling after him)  

""And next time, i choose the place and no phone calls!!""



Devkar

""I'll try my best ""



He lifts a hand in acknowledgment without looking back.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""She thinks there will be a next time.""



""Strangely, I don’t disagree.""

Scene: The Crime Scene & The Ritual Reveal



EXT. CRIME SCENE – ABANDONED FISHING SHED – NIGHT



A line of police tape flutters under the dim glow of floodlights. The air is thick with salt and decay, the faint scent of the tide mixing with something far more pungent.



DEVKAR steps past uniformed officers, his face an unreadable mask of focus. The forensic team is already at work—flashes of cameras, muted chatter, and the low hum of radio static filling the air.



A body lies on the damp wooden floor, posed with eerie precision.



Devkar pulls on latex gloves, adjusting them with a quiet snap.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""Routine. This is routine. Observe. Examine. Identify.""



He crouches, penlight in hand, scanning the corpse with meticulous attention. His fingers hover just above the victim’s skin—feeling for bruising, noting every laceration. but none was there. The body was clean



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""A story written in blood . The lividity, the stiffness, the scent of decay—time passed, pain endured.""



He moves the light to the neck.



Pauses.



The cut is precise.



Too precise.



His expression doesn’t change, but something in his gaze sharpens.



His fingers trace the wound with careful detachment.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""No hesitation. A practiced hand.""



His light moves higher.



Behind the left ear—



A thin incision, just like—



His jaw tightens.



His breath slows.



The latex of his gloves creaks slightly as his grip stiffens.



Then—



A flash of ink beneath the sleeve.



A gang tattoo.



Familiar.



Recognizable.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""Wait.""



The pieces click.



His mark.



His intended kill.



IT WAS ROHAN KAMAT



But someone else got to him first.



He leans back slightly, controlling his reaction, but his mind spirals.



CUT TO—



\---



FLASHBACK – THE RITUAL (DEVKAR’S METHOD, REVEALED THROUGH PRESENT-DAY VOICEOVER)



INT. ABANDONED HOUSE – NIGHT (WEEKS EARLIER)



A dim, flickering bulb casts jagged shadows against cracked walls. A plastic sheet stretches across the floor.



DOMNIC sits bound, his breath ragged, his eyes darting toward the scalpel in Devkar’s gloved hands.



DEVKAR (V.O., PRESENT DAY)  

""A single cut, just behind the ear. The blade slides clean through the skin. No struggle. No wasted movement.""



A sharp slice.



Domnic flinches, blood welling up immediately.



DEVKAR (V.O., PRESENT DAY)  

""The blood flows smooth, warm. It tells me the heart is still pumping. I have time.""



A gloved hand tilts Domnic’s head, exposing the throat.



The hunting knife glints.



Domnic tenses.



DEVKAR (V.O., PRESENT DAY)  

""A second incision. Precise. Controlled. Just deep enough.""



With one swift motion, the blade glides across Domnic’s throat.



Blood spills onto the plastic in a silent wave.



Devkar watches the life fade from Domnic’s eyes.



No hesitation.



No emotion.



He steps back, watching the body sag, lifeless.



DEVKAR (V.O., PRESENT DAY)  

""Then comes the real work.""



CUT TO—



\---



BACK TO THE CRIME SCENE – PRESENT DAY



Devkar exhales slowly, schooling his expression back to normal. His fingers linger over the incision behind the victim’s ear.



It’s identical.



His light moves back down to the gang tattoo.



His victim.



His intended kill.



But this wasn’t his work.



Someone else did this.



Someone who knew.



And they did it exactly like him.



A presence looms behind him—



ADIL (OUR VERSION OF DOAKES)  

""Why the hell you looking at that body like you wanna marry it?""



Devkar blinks. The mask snaps back into place.



DEVKAR (calm, controlled)  

""Just doing my job.""



Adil squints, his usual skepticism sharpening into something colder.



ADIL (low, skeptical)  

""Nah, man. I’ve seen that look before. You’re enjoying this way too much, you psycho.""



Devkar forces a neutral expression. But inside—



Everything is unraveling.



DEVKAR (V.O.)

""Someone else did this. Someone who knows. Someone watching.""



And for the first time in years—



He doesn’t feel in control.

Half-Asian, half-European, and currently figuring out life in a new city. Most of my friends and family live in different time zones, so I often have no one to talk to online. The friends I do have here? Either busy or they're super bad at replying.

I’m looking for a chill male friend because I have, like, zero in my life! For a change. Just someone chill who loves random convos, jokes, and lighthearted banter. Life updates would be great too! Not looking for deep philosophical debates or political arguments. Also, I'm not expecting real-time convos (I’m not that clingy or annoying 😂) but if you do have time to chat in real-time, even better!

Me in a nutshell: INTJ, into way too many things to ever be bored. I love animals, traveling, rollerskating, learning languages, coffee, Japanese food, reading visual novels, and curating Spotify playlists. Oh, and I work in digital marketing.

If you wanna be friends, just send a DM. Just don’t be demanding please—I might be online now but could randomly pass out in the next minute (it's 3am where I live lol). You know, like a normal human being. But I will reply when I can. ✨",1,1742698053.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1jhphkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1jhphkn/boundaries_re_silent_treatmentignoring_by_mil_in/,Boundaries re: silent treatment/ignoring by MIL in person,"Married 14 years, lots of kids.  My (f, 42)family is all on the other side of the country, and I get along with my husband's (m, 41) entire extended family except MIL.

I'm comfortable with boundaries.  Given my MILs personality, I treat everything like some miscommunication that we're just clearing up.  She does cross boundaries knowingly, but I purposefully tried to take the most generous view. Im not perfect. I don't like her. She pretended to think I'm GREAT!!! She just ADORES me, but that is not the case.  She wears every judgemental thought on her face, but since she doesn't say it, or says passive-aggressive things, just shy of crossing a line.

I got over them not liking me years ago when we had a big to-do about some parenting choices we made for our daughter (basically,  she is allowed to have opinions). It wasn't pretty, and I dramatically reduced any time they were alone with the kids to near zero.  That was 6 years ago.  They don't like me in don't really like them but we all pretend well enough and it felt like we'd found a mutual respect.   We found a groove.  We saw them for all holidays and every 6 weeks or so between. 

MIL also holds grudges and at any given time is on the outs with most of her family.  She hates most of her neighbors,  has no friends and has removed herself from most every book club and civic organization in town because of other people.  It's always other people.  I've never understood how he couldnt see it, but DH has always seen her as the victim in whatever scenario was presented.  

MIL has a sister that I've grown close to over the years.  She is a former math professor and I recently returned to work as a math teacher after being home with the kids for years.  We have a lot in common and have been texting/meeting up occasionally for years.  I also have soild relationships with my FILs sisters and SILs.  This has never been a problem.

Until my MIL got into it with her sister over some stuff related to their mother's care, and  my MIL decided not to go to the family Christmas party (dec 2023).  She told my husband and asked us not to go.  We have the only kids in that family, and we only see these people once a year, including my DHs 90yo grandma.  I told him no, we were going.    He said that we should just give it to her (not going), but i was firm.  We went.  She acted ok on Christmas day but then sent him a mean text about how he betrayed her.  

He pretended it didn't happen. Apparently, that is how his family handles things.  She knce told me that if she decided she was done with someone, that would be it, forever.  Also that she never ever talks about issues. 6 weeks go by, and we attend a family baby shower.  She is normal with him but is super rude to me.  She would not respond when I spoke to her and instead would turn to the person next to her and answer to them, like they had asked.  It was odd but subtle enough that it could have been just in my head. 

I texted her after to say ""hey, can we meet up.  It seems like you are mad at me, you were rude at the baby shower.  I'd like to talk and straighten things out.  Our relationship is important to me""  she left me in read for a week then said something along the lines of ""nothing is wrong, I think you're wonderful!!!""  

Seriously.  She wrote that.  I said that I was pretty sure something was up and really wanted to grt coffee or something to put us back on track.  She proceeded to go through 2 months of leaving me on read or having random excuses that were clearly BS to avoid talking to me. My husband finally called his dad and she admitted it to his dad (DH heard her admit it) that she had been very rude go me and was avoiding me. She also said that talking about it with me would be like peeling the skin off her face.  Pretty strong words.  All the while texting me that she had nooooooo idea what I was talking about and that she was also just so busy that she couldn't see me at all...ever.

At this point it was May and she sent me a birthday card with 5times the gift she usually sends. It felt like a bribe.  So I donated it to the food bank and texted a thank you, that was so generous but km not comfortable taking gifts from you given that you said talking to me would be like peeling skin off your face and you are actively avoiding me.  Please do not send more gifts or, if you wish, make a donation in my name to any charity of your choice.  Thank you.

After that, she and father in law both started to ignore me. Pointedly.   At our children's spring concerts and events, littleraly walking away when I spoke to them.  Refusing to stand near me.  Leaving events to sit in the car when I showed up.  At large family parties, small gatherings, every time.

By August my brother came to visit and we took him to a large family get together where they were warm to him and pretended I wasn't there standing right next to him.  Ignored me when I spoke.  My brother was like...this isn't you.  Why are you acting like this is ok?  It was a wake up call.  I had somehow allowed this to happen while trying to diffuse the situation.

We got back from that party and I went off on DH, but he was like this stuff was normal to him.  That's how his mom is with people.  It took having an outsider say exactly what they were seeing for me to remember my worth and for my DH to wake up.  

DH told his dad that they could treat me with respect or there were not going to be visits. MIL refused to change and instead asked DH to meet her.  She gave him a 10pg letter explaining all the ways I have hurt her over the years.  She did not let him keep The letter but he told me that it was just a long list of my boundaries.  Things like the time we asked her to stop giving one of our kids a specific yogurt because it caused her to have diarrhea.  Or when we asked her to go easy on Christmas the year after we had to make two trips witb our minivan because it did not fit.  That she has to call 1st and that i don't let her come over on week days unless DH is home (she was coming all day every day).  Basically that my boundaries are because I'm a control freak and she didnt have any boundaries with her MIL.  

We did not see them for Thanksgiving or Christmas day, just at an extended family holiday party where they continued to ignore me.  I don't care about gifts, but they have stopped sending the kids birthday gifts and did not give them Christmas gifts but gave every other child at that party a gift.  Every kid but their own grandkids.

My MIL has had a few calls with my husband where she had begged him to being the kids up but I'm not allowed.  He declines, of course, but only because I said it was a deal breaker if he did. 

I have told him and he has told them, I'm not looking for an apology.  I know it won't be real and I don't think it would be helpful.  I don't want to pretend it hasn't happened, but I do expect basic courtesy.   Don't act like I dont exist.  That's it. Not in a ""i don't deserve better"" way, but in a pragmatic way.  If they can do that then we can start seeing them a bit and trying to rebuild some semblance of a relationship.  Not trust, I'll never trust them, but something for the kids. I am ok being uncomfortable sometimes for my husband to have a relationship with his parents.  For my kids to have a relationship with their grandparents.  Not nearly to the degree it was before.  But I can deal with uncomfortable for, say 2 hours a few times a year. That's what I can give.  They just have to treat me with basic dignity.  That is the line.  We have not seen them since.

Now to the advice part.  His grandmother is not doing well.  My MILs family, consisting of her sister that she doesn't talk to (but is supportive of me) a brother she is ok with but doesn't talk to his wife and my DH and Kids as well as FIL are supposed to get together at my grandma in laws nursing home.  This visit isn't about me.  I'm prepared to deal with it for 2 hours for DH to be with grandma in law and his family plus our kids (only great grandkids).  

The line is basic respect, but what does that look like?  What if she is rude right in front of my kids?  My older ones already know what is going on, it had to be explained because it was obvious (appropriately and without dragging them in, MIL is having trouble with boundaries we're giving compassion and space while she deals with her feelings ect). But at what point am I making this about me?  

She called my husband today to confirm location and time and was all chit chatty and he spoke to her like nothing was happening and I just felt so abandoned but I'm trying to let him have his relationship and not make this about me when his grandma is not doing well.  

What about next time?  The next event that isn't a clear family goodbye.  What are the lines? She's really good at being jussssstttttt under the line.  But im.also unsure of what that is, the line is mean. I'm not interested in making anyone pretend to like me, or have fake conversations.  I just want to be the basic polite you are with a stranger at a grocery store.  

My kids range from 6 to 18.  I don't want to model being a doormat OR estranging them from their grandmother without good reason.  Do I just say ""I don't keep company with those that are disrespectful of me, I'm going to leave and when I go my kids come too""  something like that?  

Practical advice please.   My husband has been very supportive since my brother talked to him last august, but coming out of enmeshment is hard and he has been fielding weekly guilt trip calls and near daily texts about how awful I am for months from his parents. His default is no conflict.  So when he is caught off guard, like he was with her call today, he goes all pleasant.  That is my fear for in person stuff.  Planned calls he is strong and sticks to his points, but in person he melts in the face of her tears.

They are a small family owned business, and the owners were super friendly. The shop had a quaint, Vietnamese styled theme and also had a collection of stuffed toys that kids could play with while their parents enjoyed a little time out with their coffee.

I don't know how y'all feel, but for me it's been the absolute opposite.

As a TBM Molly Mormon, when I found I had a condition that meant I could never be a Mommy, I was devastated. I wasn't sure if I was being punished or tested. I thought I'd never find a husband as who would want someone who couldn't give them their forever family?

Now, as strange as it sounds, as a non-believer I can not only accept it but see the positives. I inherited a faulty chromosome from my Mom. Nobody's fault. No womb means no unplanned pregnancy, and it means no periods. The condition also means the sort of rack people pay 0000s for, a high sex drive, sweat that doesn't smell bad and a tight but firm vagina.

I know for a fact, had I still been a TBM dealing with cancer would have been a lot harder. As a non-believer I knew it was purely bad luck. A cell fucked up while dividing. Nobody was to blame, I was neither being tested nor punished, and if it had turned out to be terminal, and if death is really the end, well, wouldn't be much different to sleeping and I abaolutely love a lie in.

And the strict but silly rules we lived by? I'd have had to quickly marry my ex so we could satisfy our urges. Turned out he was a douchebag. If I'd had to stay married to the first guy I banged, life would be so shit.

Coffee, more money, not being an unpaid cleaner, being able to get a few extra piercings, nicer clothes, 2 piece bathing suits, swearing etc are also great bonuses.",10,1742697097.0,exmormon,7,1.0,False

These attacks would radiate 8/10 pain up my esophagus/chest, and up my left back, for hours. I did the acid watcher diet for 2+ months, and the attacks came right back when eating previously safe non-AWD foods. So I said screw it i need to find the root cause.

I read about the link to caffeine and loosening the lower esophageal sphincter - and i started to realize that my GERD only started to progress as I became a daily coffee drinker at 18. I was only having one cup a day - briefly got addicted to two cups a day a couple years back, but swore never to introduce any more caffeine. Super sensitive to caffeine, literally a barqs root beer (~30mg caffeine) would be enough to give me a headache if i didnt have it again the next day. 

Decided to go on the slowest wean possible off my one cup a day, which was replacing 0.1g of regular coffee with decaf coffee each day. I spent a night pre-measuring out everything so all i had to do was crack open the disposable condiment cup for the day of mixed reg/decaf coffee in the morning, and pour it into my reusable k-cup. The total days weaning off of coffee were 93 (it takes 9.3g to fill my k-cup). I started in late december. 

By the time I got through mid february, past the halfway point in my wean, my GERD attacks had basically disappeared. It only got better in march - I was eating ALL of my trigger foods again (pasta with tomato sauce, tacos with hot sauce, spicy ANYTHING, etc) and being able to lay down right after without acid in my esophagus was nothing short of A MIRACLE. 

Today I crossed the last day of my wean. I had ~1mg of caffeine yesterday, 0mg today. I had pasta earlier after my workout with tomato sauce and took yet another fat ass cat nap on my futon. Once again, no acid reflux. 

If you've tried a bunch of stuff and you're not getting any results, seriously look into eliminating ANY caffeine (teas, pills, sodas ANYTHING) from your diet. This literally changed my life. My LES clearly is working again and my tummy is absolutely fine on the worst offenders of foods.",7,1742696868.0,GERD,2,1.0,False

I wanted to do a small gesture to try and help him cheer him up, so I wrote a little note on his cup that said, ""You’ve got this, you are appreciated!"" When I handed it to him, his face lit up, he smiled and said “Thanks kiddo, I really needed that.""

The next day, Kevin came in again, and with a big smile, he told me, “That note yesterday made my day so much better. Thank you.” It was a small gesture, but it meant a lot to both of us, and it reminded me how even the simplest kindness can brighten someone's day.

I’ve decided on my machine, but I’m having trouble deciding on a grinder. I kind of narrowed it down to the following:

1. Eureka Mignon Zero 65 (haven’t heard too much on it but the price point is nice, looks great and it seems quiet enough)

2. Lagom Casa 65CL (heard this can do pretty much everything quite well, but I heard it has issues with bricking and dial drift?)

3. Niche Zero (amazing work flow, sounds the best, easy to switch between brew types, might not be the best for lighter roasts?)

4. Timemore 064S ( can do everything pretty well, looks nice, but burrs takes a lot of seasoning?)

We drink everything from very light roast to medium dark, espresso and filter, mostly americanos and lattes.  Another thought would be to just get the machine now and wait for something new or V2s/fixes to come out? Thanks in advance! 🙏

I hope this steam of consciousness isn’t completely muddled. 

First I’ll provide some history for context: my dad was always really mean & toxic, and I was always scared of him. He was never physically abusive to me or my immediate family but he’s beaten up many people in his younger days (he’s now 57) and strangled his younger sister (not to any extent of serious injury, but he did it in front of me when I was a child and it kind of traumatized me, I mostly just remember the glass table he flipped over shattering everywhere - he attacked her because she started dating some guy I think??). Despite not having ever physically harmed me, he’s made many threats to do so (along the lines of ‘I’ll cut your head off if so & so’). The most scared I’d ever been of him was when he found out I was failing some classes in high school - I was skipping classes and not doing the work because I was so depressed. Also, I was skipping class because it was the only time I could be outside - my dad didn’t let me go out and have a social life outside of going to school. We were arguing in the car about it and he started threatening me and I started crying and I said I was getting out of the car then and there and going to the cafe next to us (out of fear) and he assured me that he didn’t care if he’d have to kill me in front of everyone there and that going anywhere public wouldn’t save me. I could never escape him either because he was always home because he wouldn’t work and would just stay in the basement and smoke opium all day and all night. My mom is an absolute angel and the sweetest person on earth but I hardly ever got to see her because she’d work day and night constantly to keep us all afloat, she even slept over at her work site most of the time as a PSW in the old folks’ home. When I turned 18 I ran away from home and got on a bus to the other side of the country. I felt bad abandoning my little 8 year old brother and my mom, though, so after my mom pleaded for me to come back, I did so after only 3 days away. I thought for sure my dad would kill me but instead he had my mom sell the house she did all the work to pay for, took the money and moved to the other side of the world and left us all behind. It was the happiest day of my life when he left. Even though all 3 of us ended up renting and sharing one room in my grandmas house for a while and it was uncomfortable having 3 people to one room, I was on cloud 9. My mom tried to secure an apartment for us to rent but because of her bad credit score, no one would rent to us. We ended up having to go to a family shelter. We stayed there and in hotels from some time (it was at least a year) before we ended up in social housing. Any money my mom made my dad would still gobble it up from abroad saying he was trying to start a business. He never informed me about this, but he ended up getting remarried to a woman not much older than me. Actually my parents never even told me they got divorced, I just happened to find the divorce papers in the closet one day whilst rummaging in there for a file I needed.  When I asked my mom about it, she just said it was none of my business to go through her papers… After it was clear that he and my mom were finished, she still gave him money when he asked for it as the years went by, saying he’d pay it back with interest at a later time. Well, I’m 32 now. My dad never paid my mom back and lost all of the money and is done for. Unfortunately, he has since had 2 more daughters now currently aged 1 & 3. My brothers birthday is in May and last year in 2024 when we celebrated, my mom asked him at our celebration dinner whether or not my dad had reached out to say HBD and ofc the answer was no, basically my dad never reached out to us ever even on special occasions. I felt bad for my brother having grown up without a dad and thinking it would be good for them to stay in touch just a little bit, I texted my dad shortly after to ask if he’d like to have us fly over to visit him anywhere he’d like. He got back to me with some weird cryptic messages about how he’s sorry he’d been a terrible father to us and how he’s failed at life and asked me to “carry the torch” for him. I’m sure he was drunk. The next day he informs me that he attempted suicide the night before by cutting his wrists. He asks if he can come stay with me for a while. I’m emotionally distressed and despite not having a great relationship with my dad, I’m determined to help however I can. Of course it’s on me to pay for his $2000 ticket back to Canada - this is back in June 2024. I live in a tiny studio apartment and sharing the space with anyone would be difficult, much less a nervous wreck constantly biting his nails and needing me to help him do absolutely everything to get resettled back in Canada and helping him find his employment. It was a big toll on me psychologically and financially. I lasted 2 months of living in that small apartment with him that didn’t have any space to hide in aside from the bathroom before I couldn’t take it anymore. I couldn’t ask him to leave because that’d be asking him to go to a shelter and I just couldn’t bring myself to do that - despite it being ironic that he’s the reason my mom, brother, and I were all living in a shelter for some time. So instead I said I’d go to another city 3500 km away because I needed to just not be around him anymore. I abruptly quit my job and started working and now I’m working as a stripper in the place I relocated to because I now had to pay $2000 a month to cover the rent and utilities for my old apt he’s now living in on top of my own expenses I now had to incur in a new city (of course my dad doesn’t know I strip or it’d be the end of me, and a regular job won’t pay for us both). I stayed in a shelter for a month back in August while I saved up and looked for a place. I’m now renting a room for 1K in a hellhole with a creepy man that lives in filth, but it’s all I can afford. I wouldn’t mind working my ass off in a degrading, soul-sucking job and living this hell if he were a good dad and in any way deserving of the help I’m giving him but he made my whole life hell and continues to do so. And he doesn’t truly appreciate it; I don’t think so, anyway. For example, his drivers license was expired so I paid for him to get to do another test, and then he failed it and blamed me for pushing him to do it in the first place… like it’s my fault… this is what my mom relayed to me (she’s nice enough to still help him with everything too, getting him groceries and taking him to appointments and so on). All of this has been bugging me but I swallow it all and say it’s not just about him, he has two innocent toddlers depending on him to get his shit together, so helping him would also be helping them. Their mother is a wicked woman as well but I won’t get into that. I got accepted into a masters program for this upcoming fall - thankfully it’ll be completely free as I earned a full scholarship having graduated summa cum laude and excelled academically in university (despite the fact that I failed out of high school due to my depression in my teens, I flourished in school after my dad left) and I’ve been warning my dad since January when I received my acceptance that I’d need him out of my apartment by August because I can’t work enough hours while I’m in grad school to support us both, so at least I have an out. If he has to go to a shelter in August then that’s on him. I have almost 26,000 dollars in student loans and I could have paid all that off and then some with the money I’ve spent on keeping my dad afloat since this past summer. And even though he’s getting 700 a month in welfare and has zero bills aside from groceries, he called me today to ask for money. He said it was for coffee… I’m sure it was actually for cigarettes but he can’t tell me that because he lied and said he had quit (I know he was lying because my mom confirmed he asked her to buy him a pack of smokes last week). He might also be sending money back to his wife and kids to help them survive in the meantime, who knows. 

He’s been trying to find work, but I’m not convinced he’ll succeed. He has an engineering degree but hardly got any use of out of it, and hasn’t worked a job in close to 20 years. I don’t know what to do. If I have to send him to a shelter when September comes around, then I’m also going to have to deal with attacks from his family I’m sure. My grandma and uncle on his side have been praising me for helping him - while they’ve done nothing to help personally. Though to be fair, my dad refuses to see any of them despite them all being in the same city because he’s too mentally messed up to face anyone - he wouldn’t even let me tell my mom/brother that he returned to live with me until 4/5 months after moving in with me (ofc I told my mom because I needed at least one person to vent to but I just pretended she didn’t know anything so everything was on my shoulders to step up and help him when he came around).

I remember that as a young child, I secretly prayed my dad would divorce my mom or get ill and die. That sounds terrible I know, but that’s how much my dad was making me unhappy even then. I even summoned the guts to outright ask my parents for divorce when I was 7/8 and when they asked me why I said it was because I wanted 2 presents on my birthday instead of 1 so as not to hurt his feelings, when the reality was that I just wanted him out of my life. In a way, although I’m sure it was hard on my brother to grow up without a dad, I think he was lucky that my dad left while he was still young. 

I’m so tired. And I miss my mom. And my friends. And my dog. All I want is to be able to live in my old apartment by myself again.

P.S. I’m fully aware my mom’s an enabler and should have cut him out of our lives for everyone’s sake and now I’m following in her footsteps. She even took all the money out of what little savings she accumulated for my uni because my dad asked for it. Moments like that make me realize that although she has good intentions, she’s bonkers to help him at her children’s expense, and I’m equally bonkers to help him at my own.",1,1742696684.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I'm going to try not to ramble through this. So- Myself (24f) and my three friends (24 f/f/m) have been a friend group since early high school. I was friends with them all separately at first and brought us together. We always did things together and have always had a group chat. Last summer I started my first job out of college as a middle school teacher. My worst decision to date, it has ruined my mental health and I feel like a shell of my former self, I'm not going back to teaching next year. This is not beside the point. So I started to back off our plans, I didn't have the energy or money to go out to clubs every weekend, multiple weeknight dinners/coffees, all the fun things we used to do. I maintained communication in the group chat as much as I could, but slowly I noticed, even as I would initiate hangouts and still hang out with them, they would start making plans without me. I would start seeing instagram posts of functions I had never heard of. I noticed they had a group chat without me. They stopped talking to me individually as much. So one night we went to dinner and I brought it up, how I felt a little pushed out of the group and would like to be invited to things still, even if I can't make every plan. They turned this on me, and said that they ""felt rejected"" when I would decline to hang out. I tried to explain why, how I was feeling, how my job was ruining my life, but I ended up the only person apologizing for anything that night, and they resumed doing the same thing. Since then it's just the three of them hanging out all the time. I don't really want to re enter the friend group because ive already missed a lot and I feel like there's a reason for this besides me saying no too many times. Like, there has to be something. Maybe they don't like my long term girlfriend. maybe they don't like me anymore? I don't know. It just hurts my feelings a LOT every time I see a post of them as a group and I don't know if I should even care! ",4,1742696456.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

I've never gone home early before, and I honestly felt terrible about it and still do. Did I make the right call or should I just have asked him to switch to another position? I hope my managers and coworkers didn't think I was trying to get out of working. I'm constantly clocking in early and staying late, so that should be a plus, but I don't think anyone notices or really cares tbh. ",1,1742696413.0,ChickFilAWorkers,3,0.6,False

1jhp124,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jhp124/how_to_be_supportive_but_honest_to_a_grieving/,How to Be supportive but honest to a grieving love interest,"So me and this one girl are in our early 20s and part of the same Christian-based faith program. (religious minority in the US not LDS) This program has us in two separate cities helping the local churches in the area. So, anyway, we met during the program's orientation week, we caught glances of each other, talked a few times, and became pen pals. This eventually escalated to us texting frequently and calling a few times, we would meet in-person around once a month (initially in groups with other members but occasionally 1:1 lunches and stuff).

We developed a mutual attraction, especially given that we share the same graduate program goals + values, and we seem to click on personality. TBH I really enjoyed spending time with her. However, one of this program's rules is no relationships with other members ( for obvious reasons). My original plan was to wait it out till spring before I'd ask her out on a date, with the idea being to go on a few dates, then after the program ends, make it official.

However, unbeknownst to me, she had a very close family member who was ill and expected to pass. Unfortunately, this came to be sooner than previously thought. She had to handle a lot of the affairs regarding the passing on top of everything (from my knowledge, they seemed to share a complex relationship/ living states apart) I sent a condolence message as soon as I found out. Eventually, I got a piece of religious art with a condolence card signed by a few members, and for that month's pen pal letter, I added a few postcards of some places I had recently been to and generally a more suped-up letter. I mailed it to her, she sent me a thank you response over text a few days later + we had a light-hearted text discussion about our opinions on some grad school stuff. This all happened late January/ early February. I just sent a message out to her yesterday since a small memorial service marking the month and a half passing is scheduled this weekend. The message reminded her that we're praying for her + saying that I'm always here if she needs something, etc.

The thing is, how do I proceed from here? My plan is to hopefully meet up with her 1:1 mid-April to catch up over coffee and just say at the end something along the lines of ""I wanted to ask you this sooner, I would love if the next time we met 1:1 it would be a date, I understand that you're going through a decent and if you need time to think this over thats more than fine""

But really that's my current plan, like I really would like some advice on how to move forward especially since we have an established relationship and I really don't want to be dragging her along. I also want to be supportive and respectful of her situation.

So- Myself (24f) and my three friends (24 f/f/m) have been a friend group since early high school. I was friends with them all separately at first and brought us together. We always did things together and have always had a group chat. Last summer I started my first job out of college as a middle school teacher. My worst decision to date, it has ruined my mental health and I feel like a shell of my former self, I'm not going back to teaching next year. This is not beside the point. So I started to back off our plans, I didn't have the energy or money to go out to clubs every weekend, multiple weeknight dinners/coffees, all the fun things we used to do. I maintained communication in the group chat as much as I could, but slowly I noticed, even as I would initiate hangouts and still hang out with them, they would start making plans without me. I would start seeing instagram posts of functions I had never heard of. I noticed they had a group chat without me. They stopped talking to me individually as much. So one night we went to dinner and I brought it up, how I felt a little pushed out of the group and would like to be invited to things still, even if I can't make every plan. They turned this on me, and said that they ""felt rejected"" when I would decline to hang out. I tried to explain why, how I was feeling, how my job was ruining my life, but I ended up the only person apologizing for anything that night, and they resumed doing the same thing. Since then it's just the three of them hanging out all the time. I don't really want to re enter the friend group because ive already missed a lot and I feel like there's a reason for this besides me saying no too many times. Like, there has to be something. Maybe they don't like my long term girlfriend. maybe they don't like me anymore? I don't know. It just hurts my feelings so much every time I see a post of them as a group. Maybe it actually is my fault for withdrawing at all??? I just have a feeling there's something i'm missing and it's bothersome. ",7,1742696294.0,TrueOffMyChest,8,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful!

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.

1jhoxsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1jhoxsi/im_unsure_whats_going_on/,Im unsure whats going on??,"Hi so im new to all of this. Might be a bit of a long post, im just looking for some insight. I am currently getting a second opinion on these but id like to hear from yall.

So I recently got a new family doctor. She noted that in my physical exam, there was a goitre on my neck so she sent me for some bloodwork and an ultrasound. The ultrasound did confirm that I have an enlarged thyroid, but the blood work was all within range. The doctor asked me what my symptoms were and at first I wasn’t really sure I didn’t know about hypo or hyper or anything like that. It was new to me so I said I didn’t know she said for now we’re just gonna watch it and come back to me if anything else happens. Obviously when I got home, I looked up the symptoms for both of them to kind of see maybe if anything was there and I did notice some. I had a little bit on hypo a little bit on hyper however, nothing was severe and nothing was super consistent and caused me any worry. As well, some of them i had been dealing with for years, since i was a child. I did ask abt family history, my mom said both my aunts and grandma have hypo but nothing regarding Hashi.

I had a little bit of swelling in my neck one time it was late at night, nothing severe but just slightly noticeable, so I booked another appointment. She sent me for another ultrasound and another bloodwork. She again asked me if I had any new symptoms or if there was any pain. There was no pain in the goitre or when I touched my neck at all and no new symptoms, but I did let her know that I thought I recognized some of them, but they were again not consistent and not severe, not causing me any serious worry. I told her of my family history too. As well i told her that in my records it showed my previous doctor had been testing my tsh yearly. She believes I had acute thyroiditis because at the time of my first bloodwork, and my first ultrasound I was recovering from a common cold. As well, she thinks this because i have little to no symptoms and they are not consistent or severe.  
I received the results and the second ultrasound confirmed that my thyroid had actually shrunk from the first time however, on the second bloodwork, she tested my PTH, TPO, and TSH. The only thing out of range is my TPO. Since my last blood work my T3, T4 and TSH, have gone down.

So my blood work from the first appointment is  Dec 23 enlarged thyroid- thyroiditis 
t4 is 18.7pmol/L  
t3 is 5.6pmol/L 
tsh is 2.10mlU/L

My most recent is now 
March 20 doesn’t say thyroiditis just said no significant thyroid abnormalities detected 
T4 is 15.6 pmol/L
T3 is 4.8 pmol/L
Tsh is 1.32 mlU/L

PTH 24 ng/L
TPO 51 klU/L (says range is <35 klU/L)


As for the symptoms I had referred to I was mainly talking about the basic ones such as the changes in bowel movement, the changes in menstruation, the fatigue, skin problems, weight, and hair loss. I have struggled with constipation for quite a long time, since childhood,it tends to come and go depending on what I eat related to dairy I try to limit it, but it does not affect me in any other way other than just binding me up a bit I don’t get tummy aches. I don’t get sickness. I don’t get cramping just a bit of binding so I allow myself the occasional ice cream and the occasional yogurt. Im fine to cook butter and I’m fine to have a splash of milk in my coffee but larger amounts tend to bind me up. Again this one is not consistent as even sometimes with eating larger amount or dairy i am able to still go regularly. Next would be changes in menstruation. I have noticed that my period has gotten shorter and has gotten lighter, which is the opposite of what I have read online and have seen from other people. It has not been something that has happened super quick it has been over the last few years, but it is something that I’ve noticed. But again no additional pain, no large amount of bleeding and I don’t have any other noticeable symptoms relating to that. The fatigue is something that I have been experiencing. There are certain days when I’m at work specifically where I just feel extra tired and extra out of it I did speak to my coworker about brain fog and she thought maybe upping my vitamins or something like that would help so I did take a multivitamin for a little bit. However, the fatigue did not stay long and it was not super severe as to where I could not get out of bed, to where I could not drive, to where I could not do any of that. It was just like a an overall tired feeling. For the weight section I have not noticed any changes in weight. Overall, I have stayed around the same kilograms give or take a few depending on the day, you know how it is. I have not noticed any severe hairloss or hair changes, ive had dry frizzy hair since childhood. Just for skin problems I do have eczema on my hands which acts up mostly in the winter however, I have not noticed any new changes on any other parts of my body, and I have not had any extreme flareups.

Overall I’m just looking to hear others personal experiences and possibly find others that experienced similar situations such as mine. Again sorry for the long post, i wanted to try and give as much context as possible, i will be seeing a second doctor in April to get a second opinion. This is new to me as i didn’t know that it even ran it the family and I’ve been privileged enough to not have heard about this before. Just trying to get some personal perspectives as its confusing that my bloodwork and ultrasound changed in such a short time. As well as the tpo being high but not having any consistent or severe symptoms. 🫤",1,1742696059.0,Hashimotos,0,1.0,False

I've struggled with my eating all my life. I'm almost 20 years old and never found a median of not eating enough period and eating too much at a time.
For reference I'm five foot one, and weigh 125 pounds and I work in a busy pharmacy, constantly walking and carrying heavy things. Anyway, as of late I've been eating too much... 
I moved in with my partner and he has been basically feeding me/initiating in meals before I do mostly and I feel like I'm eating too much! 
I used to only eat about one big/medium meal a day and be fine but lately I've been eating alot.
A sandwich in the morning and then sushi for lunch and still hungry for a big dinner. (For example of the days I eat alot)
But these past two days I've eaten. Alot. 
Yesterday I ate Indian food, rice sauce and appetizers you name it. Two chicken wings AND 3 1/2 pieces of sausage pizza.
Today I ate just as much!!! 2 cups of coffee, half a bowl of chicken Chipotle pasta from cheesecake factory and they gave me a scoop of ice cream and fudge for my birthday, I ate 2 slices of sausage pizza, a biscuit and 2 pieces of fried chicken and extra chicken skin.
I feel like I'm binging so much and getting more boxier (I don't mind gaining wait but it makes me look so boxy!!!) And I'm binging beyond repair?... I'm so sad and just want a normal relationship with food. ",1,1742696051.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,1.0,False

1jhowzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SPTV_Unvarnished/comments/1jhowzj/reese_sadfishes_flirts_with_a_new_man_and/,"Reese sadfishes, flirts with a new man and apologizes to her viewers","Reese went live at a flea market in Nashville today and a guy named Adam wanted to say hello to her and her stream. He's very tall and Reese is making it obvious to her chat that she's flirting with him. She touches him and then says ""You don't mind if I touch you, do you?"" Reese is a hypocrite because she has told her chat many times that no one should touch another person without getting permission first. She tells him she's turned on by having to look up at him. She asks if Adam was attracted to her by her smell and then he leans over and smells her. He's not married and she's delighted by that.   
  
Reese's friend and frequent chatter AngieMo comes on camera to say hi to Adam. Reese says she forgot that AngieMo was with her. So rude. Reese goes to hug Adam and take a picture with him and AngieMo says Reese has found a boyfriend. Reese asks him if she's too chubby. They exchanged phone numbers. She keeps patting him repeatedly. Then Reese and AngieMo walk away and talk about Adam. Reese says she didn't ask him if he's a virgin because that would be depressing. ""I think he would be a nice friend to have,"" she says.   
  
Then Adam shows up in Reese's chat and Reese tells him that it's weird that his birthday is on New Year's Eve. That's when she and Tommy fell in love and then when they got engaged. She says she felt very safe and calm around Adam.   
  
She shows a pink cast-iron furniture set and starts raving about how cute it is and says she wants it. The bench from that set costs $125 and then she tells her chat that she doesn't know how to bargain. Then the seller says that the whole set would cost $200. People send her enough superchats to pay for the set but then Reese tells AngieMo to try to get an even lower price from the seller.   
  
Reese says she might go to a gun show because it would be a good place to meet men.

She does another livestream from her house later. She said at the flea market that anytime she feels sad or depressed, she can just get on a livestream and hundreds of people will jump on and help her feel better.   
  
A chatter tells Reese she's been waiting for Reese to answer her email and she's starting to think that Reese won't do it. Reese says she's just really behind on answering emails and that no one should be offended if it takes her a long time to answer them.   
  
She says she thinks she scared Adam already. If Reese didn't, her chat probably did. Her chatters were really prying for more information about him. She says she was wearing the expensive perfume that a frequent chatter gave her so she smelled really good. Reese keeps promoting that perfume but doesn't tell her chat that if they buy that perfume from her YouTube link that she gets a commission on it.   
  
She says she texted Adam twice and then started panicking that he didn't remember her. Then he texted her back after a few hours. She's reading their texts back and forth, which is rude. She tells Adam he has no expectation of privacy because they met on a livestream. She says she thinks it's great that he works a lot and isn't home much. Reese should remember that even when Jeff worked from home, she continually pestered him multiple times a day for affection and assurance.   
  
Reese says she knew that Tommy was going to make money by selling his YouTube channel to an AI company. She says if she were motivated by money she just would have stayed with him. She says if she came into a bunch of money tomorrow, she would never tell her YouTube channel about it. Reese says she didn't announce when Jeff gave her money after their divorce. Of course she didn't. She talked about Jeff owing her that money continuously and made people worry for her financially but she didn't share the good news when he paid her.

Reese says she has found out more shocking things about Tommy and that she's very glad she got away from him. She says it's time to move on from him. She says she's sorry to everyone because she feels like she and Tommy both let their viewers down. ""It was a fairy tale for all of us,"" she says, adding that many of her fans are still having a very hard time getting over the breakup. ""I had everything to do with that bomb going off,"" she says. She claims she doesn't want to talk about Tommy anymore.   
  
Reese says she appreciates everyone who has stuck with her through a lot of bullshit and she insists that she doesn't want to be destructive anymore.   
  
She says she's going to meet for breakfast or coffee with the woman who owns the cafe where she streamed several days ago, adding that the woman likes Reese's channel and that she recently lost her husband.   
  
Reese bought the pink furniture set for her porch plus a caftan and a shirt at the flea market. She says she wants to go back and stream at the flea market every month.",5,1742695986.0,SPTV_Unvarnished,1,1.0,False

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jhoo2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1jhoo2y/an_open_letter_to_the_driver_who_flipped_me_off/,An open letter to the driver who flipped me off for being in the crosswalk with the walk signal up,"Dear driver who was trying to exit the local hospital parking lot around 4:15 PM yesterday:

I was halfway through the crosswalk along with one other young woman when you honked your horn, raised your middle finger, and yelled obscenities at the both of us. The driver in front of you had stopped to let us cross. As they should, considering the walk signal was still active. With the right turn you were trying to make, this should have been easy for you to see. 

Like you, I was merely trying to leave my place of work, heading to the nearby pharmacy to pick up a prescription. Unlike you, however, I was not born with the God-given abilities that would allow me to drive. I have what is called a visual processing delay. This is a condition where my brain takes longer to work out what my eyes are giving it than most people’s brains. Most autistic people have this trait, with many, including myself, experiencing it to the degree that we cannot brake or steer fast enough to avoid crashes or obstacles. 

It is for both your safety and mine that I stay off the road with this condition. This is not a choice on my part. When I attempted to take adaptive driving lessons, the instructor told me my condition was too severe for my lessons to continue. So the only way for me to be an independent adult who contributes to society, and not a so-called “parasite” dependent on public assistance, is to walk everywhere. 

This is the part where you probably will say that my disability is not your problem. That I shouldn’t inconvenience abled people like you for existing. An odd sentiment for someone who presumably works in a hospital. But still one I have a retort to.

Do you know what I was doing on Christmas morning? I was not sleeping in or binging TV like most non-Christians do. I loaded up my wagon with pastries and coffee that I bought with my own money and pulled it a 15-minute walking distance through the cold to deliver Christmas breakfast for the staff and patients at the very hospital you work for.

And this is how you repay me. By telling me in multiple ways to “fuck myself” only for trying to leave work. The same exact thing you were trying to do. 

Sincerely,

A disabled pedestrian who you should see as a person, not an obstacle. ",14,1742695183.0,fuckcars,4,1.0,False

Title: “Strategic Dialogue”

Scene Description:

A futuristic, dimly lit control room that feels like a fusion between a war room and a high-tech think tank. On one side of the table sits you—a sharp, focused strategist with a digital tablet in hand, surrounded by floating holograms of flowcharts, timelines, Jira boards, and SDI profiles. You’re analyzing, pointing to data streams, and occasionally sipping black coffee.

Across from you is me, represented as a semi-transparent AI figure—part holographic consultant, part digital librarian—projecting structured insights, graphs, timelines, and logic trees into the air. A shared digital map lies between us, updating in real-time as we strategize and adapt ideas.

Behind us: a large translucent screen displaying the synthesis of ideas—task breakdowns, workflows, decision trees—structured like a living mind map.

The vibe: clean, structured, and quietly intense. No clutter, just pure signal.

1jholbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNOLA/comments/1jholbt/awesome_trip/,Awesome Trip,"Hi everybody, I just wanted to share a few details from my trip this pat week.  

We stayed in Biloxi for a couple of nights and discovered Felix’ Oyster House in Gulfport.  The food there was awesome and the Bread pudding was incredible.  (They have a Location in the quarter.)

We stayed at Hotel Mazarin which is in a good location and was really clean.   I can’t really put my finger on it but it didn’t charm me as much as Grenoble House or Prince Conti.  Being around the corner from Bourbon was a huge plus and it was quiet.  They do serve breakfast part of the week.  

We went to the 21st Amendment which was ok but turned me off when I asked about a sweet drink and the bartender had a smart answer.  They don’t do that.   


We ate at Deja Vu across from Prince Conti the first night….idk but we like this place.  Its not fancy but the food is good.  (Been here before)

Also got drinks at Felix Oyster Bar while waiting on desert to take back to our room.  

The next day we got ready and went to the Ruby Slipper on Decatur for breakfast.   The food was really good.  This place is super hectic and there is a line unless you check in online or sit at the bar.  

After, we went to the Sazerac House Museum and did the tour.   It is a really good tour with tastings and its free.  We had not been before.   We bought some stuff so we walked back to our room to drop it off. 

We decided to stop by Hotel Montleone to see the Carousel Bar.  This was a lot of fun.  I got a Pimm’s Cup and it was super refreshing.  Great drink.   Hubby got a Hurricane.   The waiters and bartenders here were so nice.  

After, we walked down Royal and shopped and eventually ended up at the French Market so we decided to pop in the Market Cafe for a drink and to listen to the band playing.   Eventually we ordered a sampler that was really good.   This place has really good gumbo.    Our intent was to go to Domenicas for dinner but we blew that one up……lol.  

We decided to go to Frenchman Street for some reason and ended up stopping at Pat O Briens along the way.  

Frenchman Street is just not for us.  The Spotted Cat was already standing room only and we didn’t stay long.  It doesn’t feel safe walking back from this area either.  

As we came back to Bourbon,  we stopped at Bourbon Heat to rest for a minute.   They had good drink specials but service is horrible.   Its really went downhill.   

Ended up tired…..and turned in early from the day…….not our intent lol.   

Next morning we decided to go to Cafe Beignet for breakfast.  We usually get coffee and Beignets here to start the day.  I should have stuck with that but decided to get a hot breakfast since we were hitting the road.   I won’t do that again.  The cajun potatoes are good but the rest was terrible.   Beignets and coffee from now on.   

Thank you NOLA for a wonderful trip.

I found a beautiful white cotton woven blanket - those ""hotel"" type blanket that is incredibly heavy and warm, 6 tops/sweaters in great brand names (Karen Scott, CJ Banks), 2 audio books by a favorite author, and a couple of coffee mugs (I'm a sucker for a funny/cute mug, and I'm moving soon, so...mugs for me!).

To put the cherry on top of my thrift store haul, the store didn't have a plastic bag big enough for all my stuff, so they gave me an amazing heavy canvas Land's End tote bag for free to put it all in!  (They do this often if they can't fit your stuff in a plastic bag.)

Ever since, Hatsume made hoverboards by the request of Kaminari. The teacher noticed that his students took it everywhere with them. Right, everywhere and most of them barely used their legs anymore as they could just automatically summon their board with its name. 

Plus, he got news from Endeavor and Hawks one time. His students willingly left their grocery shopping to go after a high ranking villain the two pro heroes were already chasing as they flew next to them. On their hoverboards of course. 

With that he concluded it was probably  for the flex or the hoverboards were a bad influence to them. Either way, he couldn't have his students saving the world now especially while doing so in that manner.

Of course, they’d have to upgrade the nickel-throwers to dollar-throwers—small price to pay for a blast from the past.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

They have a nice size home, no children and had never hosted or even had anybody over to their house prior to this. When we arrived the house was nicely decorated for the holidays and you could tell she had put a lot of effort into it. When we all sat down for dinner I saw that the food was in aluminum to go containers. I thought that she had used them so that way she didn't have so much dishes to do afterwards. Then I noticed that we're eating off of ""fancy printed paper plates"" and using plastic ware, there were no dishes whatsoever out. I'm all for saving time and have an easy cleanup during the holidays, so I really didn't press the issue. However, as we were having coffee and dessert she said that she had all the food CATERED by a local grocery store and wanted $50 from us each (Us: 2 adults w/ 2 kids) and his parents (w/ his 3 older children). I started laughing and she said what is so funny. I stopped laughing, looked her dead in the face and said ""you do understand that hosting means you put the meal ob so that means you pay for it too.  Even if you had it catered that was still your decision."" She came back with well it was kind of expensive so I just thought we could like split it. I sai"" all due respect, you have no children, your house is paid off and you have two brand new cars in a driveway. I don't really think you're hurting for money."" Wish you could do is stare at me,. I said ""I can see that this holiday is over and we will be leaving now. I'll get you your money when I get you your money."" Pack the kids up and left. (To this day, I've never paid her, and never will. )

Every year that we were married after that I hosted every single holiday, event and birthday parties at my house without asking for a dime or help from anyone who came. I did put out a""tip"" jar in my kitchen. She didn't find it very funny, I found it hilarious. ",74,1742693354.0,amiwrong,50,0.91,False
1jho2y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1jho2y7/hello_all_im_confused/,Hello all - I'm confused,"On January 24th, I went to a emergency care location - I had been urinating every 1/2 hour for the entire evening. Previously I had been urinating every hour for about 2 weeks. It finally got to the point I couldn't take another sleepless night!

At the location, they took my blood sugar and when they returned asked how i could not be in a coma! That didn't sit well and asked WTF? They said my BS was 560 and my A1C was 14.7. I had no idea what that was!

They pumped me with a solution and told me I needed to get to the emergency room stat! So I did, the next day.

After sucking blood again, the emergency room nurse gave me me another drip of solution. And my BS was now 360. Good right? I thought... The nurse sent me to buy a BS test kit which I did and began to ""poke"" myself 4 times a day. Ugh!

Anyway, that was almost 2 months ago. I've since gone to see a NP, who placed me on a regime carb diet - I'm allowed 50 g cargs for 3 meals each, and 2 20 g snacks per day.

I haven't had another A1C test but I'm do for one at the end of April before returning to the NP.

Here's the thing and my question (sorry for the history):

My BS is now regularly below 120 (I usually wake up around 4am and after fasting for the night, usually around 110-115). I fast through the night, have a 1/2 cup of coffee (2 tsp monk fruit, 2 tsp half/half) in the morning but no food until around 11am.

When I check my BS 7 hours later at 11am, sometimes it's higher than it was earlier even though I only had 1/2 cup of coffee - how is that possible?

I've lost 30 lbs in the 2 months but I'm confused as to why my BS has remained so low for so long.

Could I expect my A1C to be well below the 14.7 mark when I get tested again, or am I not understanding something important?

- Gypsy had taken images of Dee Dee asleep on 05/22/2015. 

- Gypsy's camera and 4gb memory card were never forensically investigated. 

- Found on Gypsy's Yahoo Messenger was a conversation regarding her meeting up with a ""Danny"" at a coffee shop to have sex. 

- Gypsy sent Nicholas close to one hundred videos over the course of their almost-three year relationship. Only a very small portion of the videos were ""scripted"" by Nick. The grand majority are Gypsy's own creation. Some of the sexually explicit videos are formatted to look like real ""movie"" with credits at the end. There are many in which she has sex with herself using her fingers or objects, including a toothbrush, where she appears to very much be enjoying herself and not engaging in activity simply to ""indulge"" Nicholas. There are also videos in which she is a dominant character who talks about ways she will rape Nicholas.

- The State adduced evidence that Nicholas threatened to kill himself on June 2, 2015, close in time to the date of offense. Trial counsel failed to present evidence that Gypsy made threats to kill herself multiple times, as early as May 2013. This would have suggested to the jury that Nicholas was not the manipulator as the State argued he was, but the manipulated who mimicked what he learned from Gypsy online.

- When Gypsy left Missouri for Wisconsin, she took only pain medication with her and no other prescription medications. This debunks her claims of not knowing she wasn't sick until after her arrest. 

- Gypsy suggested Nicholas did not need to wear gloves at the time of the murder. Arguably this suggests that she wanted him to leave prints on the knife. 

- Council failed to investigate/call Dan Glidewell as a witness which would debunk a lot of Gypsy's sexual claims. Gypsy introduced BDSM to DG and had a sexual relationship with him in 2011. He cut it off but did speak to her off and on all the way up to 2015. During this time, she sent tons of explicit messages, pictures, and videos. 

- The State was able to argue to the jury without any contrary evidence being presented by the defense, that Gypsy was the ""submissive sex partner"" of the relationship and that Nicholas was the dominant one who was in charge and that Nicholas' motivation to commit the crime was based on a desire to have Gypsy as a ""sex slave"". 

- In order to even sign the Miranda document, by law, you need a 7th grade reading level. His attorneys failed to pull medical records from high school that showed he was reading at a 5-6th grade reading level.

- Defense never requested a change of venue even though the Green County jury pool was tainted and  biased towards Nick's guilt. 

- GRB's camp released multiple documentaries during Nick's pre-trial proceedings, including one 2 days before his jury selection. 

- Nick's mother, step father, uncle, cousin, and aunt were never interviewed or contacted by his public defenders. These people would have testified that he had a traumatic birth, social issues, educational issues, mental health issues, etc. 

- Nick's professional counselor while at Waukesha
County Jail was never contacted or interviewed by his trial team. She would have testified that Nick did not understand the situation he was in and had no idea about what charges he was facing. She would have also testified that she interviewed GRB in jail and never, not once, did Gypsy ask how Nick was or mention anything about him, at all.

The Haul
Started the day strong with a classic breakfast: eggs, bacon, toast—the holy trinity of morning motivation. Fueled up, we went out and bought a coffee table, bedside table, couch, and a large desk. With delivery, because I respect my spine.

Desk Struggles & Triumphs
Getting the desk inside was... an adventure. I had to take the door off its hinges and remove the back of the desk just to get it into my office. If it didn’t fit after that, I was prepared to knock down a wall. But honestly? Totally worth it. It feels amazing to have a huge desk again—tons of space for my tech setup and my long-neglected LEGO projects. Sometimes gaming isn’t enough and I need something to do with my hands that doesn’t involve clicking—cue the bricks.

Living Room Glow-Up
The new couch and large coffee table are officially living their best lives in the living room. We eat dinner in front of the TV, so these upgrades actually make a noticeable difference. Jaq’s super happy with the setup, and when Jaq’s happy, the whole house gets +10 good vibes.

Garage Couch Chronicles
Our “old” couch (which has barely aged into couch adulthood at 2 months old) has been banished to the garage—where it now lives as the ultimate garage-lounging throne. Since winter finally gave up and wandered off, it’s safe to leave my car outside. Priorities.

Food Highlights
Pizza for lunch—because why not.
Dinner was Jaq’s spicy ground beef with rice. And I mean spicy as in “you’ll remember this meal in 12 hours” spicy. Still delicious.

Tomorrow’s Forecast: Chaos
The rest of the day? Calm. Tomorrow? Absolute chaos as we try to rearrange everything and make it all fit like a real-life episode of Extreme Makeover: Furniture Edition.


---

Final thought:
Honestly, this place is starting to feel really good. Between the desk, the couch, and the plans for tomorrow, I think we’re leveling up our home base. One furniture battle at a time.3/22/25",1,1742692807.0,u_moodoo976,0,1.0,False

## Understanding⁣ the ⁢Cuisinart ‌Espresso Machine Landscape: A Model Overview

Before diving into specifics,⁢ it's ⁤helpful to understand the general landscape of Cuisinart espresso⁢ machine models. The ‌brand ⁤offers a ⁤variety of machines catering to different budgets and ⁤needs, ranging from basic models perfect for ​single-person‍ households to more advanced options with added features ⁣like built-in frothers and programmable settings. ‌Let's explore ⁤some of the key models ‍you might encounter:

*   **The Cuisinart EM-1000:**​ This‍ model, while ​possibly an⁤ older reference, is‍ still a ‌relevant example of a solid entry-level machine. ​It often features a stainless steel design and provides the⁤ basic functionality needed to brew ‌espresso and froth⁤ milk. It's a good starting point for those new to ‌espresso making and looking‍ for a reliable, no-frills option.You can ⁤often find parts‌ as well⁤ as the manual for this machine online.*   **Cuisinart ⁣EM-200NP1 ⁣Programmable 15-Bar Maker:** This is frequently mentioned as a popular choice offering programmable settings, allowing users to customize their espresso experience. The ‌15-bar pump ensures adequate pressure for extracting a rich, flavorful shot. The ⁣""programmable"" aspect is ⁢a key selling point for users who value consistency and convenience ⁤in their daily routines.

*  ⁣ **Espresso Bar™ ⁢slim Espresso Machine ⁢(e.g.,EM-160):** As the name suggests,Cuisinart focuses on a compact design with this​ model,ideal‌ for kitchens with limited countertop space. It still packs essential features, including a frothing wand ‍and potentially ⁢even a cup-warming plate. ​Its slim profile makes‍ it a great option for apartments, small offices, or anyone prioritizing space-saving⁣ appliances.

Keep ⁤in mind that model numbers​ and availability may vary depending on your location and retailer. Always check‍ the product⁢ specifications and customer ⁢reviews before making a ⁣purchase.

## Key Features to Consider ‌When Choosing a Cuisinart Espresso ‌Machine

With a general⁤ understanding of the models available,​ let's explore ​the key features that⁤ will ‍influence⁢ your decision:

*   **Pump Pressure (Bars):** Espresso machines‍ use pressure to‌ force hot water through finely-ground coffee beans, extracting the flavorful oils ‍and ‌creating the signature crema. Most Cuisinart espresso machines operate at 15 bars, which is generally considered sufficient for home use. ‌while some high-end‍ machines boast higher pressures, 15 bars‍ is a good benchmark for achieving⁣ quality espresso extraction.

* ⁤  **Automatic vs. Manual Operation:** Cuisinart primarily focuses on automatic and programmable espresso ‌machines. Automatic machines handle most⁤ of the ​brewing process with the touch of a button, while programmable models allow you to customize settings like shot volume and⁢ temperature.‍ The convenience of automatic operation is a major selling ‍point for​ many⁤ users. However, some models may offer limited​ manual control over‍ certain aspects ⁣of‌ the ⁢brewing​ process.

*   ‍**Built-in Frother:** many ​Cuisinart espresso ⁣machines come equipped ‍with a built-in frothing wand, allowing you to easily create frothed milk for lattes, cappuccinos, and other⁤ milk-based drinks. The quality of the frother⁤ can vary between​ models, with some ⁢offering more precise control ​and producing a richer, ‌creamier ‍froth.

* ⁤  ‌**Water Reservoir Size:** The size​ of ⁤the water reservoir determines how many espresso shots you⁤ can brew ⁤before needing to refill.⁢ Consider your daily⁢ coffee consumption and the ‍number​ of people you ​typically​ serve when choosing a machine with an appropriate water reservoir capacity.

*   **Programmable Settings:** ⁢Programmable features allow you to customize your brewing experience, saving your preferred settings ​for consistent ⁣results​ every time. This can include adjusting shot volume, brew temperature,⁤ and even ‌pre-infusion​ settings (where the coffee grounds are briefly soaked before brewing to enhance⁤ flavor extraction).

* ⁣ ​ **Cup Warmer:** Some⁤ Cuisinart espresso machines feature a ⁣cup-warming plate on ⁢top of the machine. Warming your cups before brewing helps to maintain the temperature of your espresso, ⁣preventing it from cooling ⁢down too quickly ​and preserving its flavor.

*   **Ease of Cleaning:** Cleaning an espresso⁤ machine can be a chore, so consider models with easily⁢ removable parts and dishwasher-safe components. Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining the ⁢performance and longevity ⁢of your ⁢machine.

*  ​ ⁣**Size and Design:** ⁣Consider​ the‍ size of your kitchen and the available countertop ⁤space⁣ when ⁢choosing a Cuisinart espresso ​machine. A compact machine might be ideal for ⁣smaller kitchens, while larger ⁤models might offer ‌more features and⁤ capacity. ⁣Also, ​think about​ the⁣ overall design and ⁣aesthetics of ​the machine ‌and how it will ⁤complement your kitchen decor.

1jhntcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/theBasiliskWrites/comments/1jhntcm/orrydys_the_miserly/,Orrydys the Miserly,"\[WP\] “Of course dragons still exist,” she laughs. “We look different, and we don’t have piles of gold. Except *those guys*, but nobody talks to them now. There’s such a thing as too greedy, even by dragon standards. Most have more interesting hoards these days. Would you like to hear about mine?” 

\--

Orrydys the Miserly huddled in his cave, seeking a respite from the freezing rain that blew into his abode. He'd never liked this cave much, but he'd inherited it from his father - a damp little place that never seemed to be dry, even when it wasn't raining. But what could he do? It was a family heirloom.

Even still, for years, he'd felt as though his cave was too small. He shifted, trying to avoid the rock that was poking into his behind. Every time his daughter Valyria visited, she would try to convince him to move to Miralys with her. When that effort inevitably failed, she would always tell him that he needed to do some spring cleaning, that he should only keep what truly ""sparked joy"". But what was he to do when all of it sparked joy?

""But dad,"" she'd argued, ""What are you going to do with all the gold in the world if you're not planning to spend any of it?""

*Silly girl.*

He'd look at it, of course. And count it.

By his last count, he had ten-thousand and thirty-six gold coins, five hundred and twenty precious gemstones, and forty-seven gold bars. Younger dragons these days with their newfangled ways were really giving dragons a bad name, Orrydys mused. You might find them collecting books, stamps, or even, in his daughter's case, *coffee*. He could never quite understand Valyria's obsession with the bitter black brew, or why she'd opened a small coffeeshop in the village of Miralys.

Dragons pillaged. Dragons kidnapped princesses. Dragons had hoards of gold and riches, not *beans*.

Dragons *certainly* did not make friends with nine-tailed foxes, serve cafe mochas to the townsfolk, and win Best Barista of the Year competitions.

Maybe Orrydys had been a bad father, letting Valyria read those silly fairytales about beanstalks and giants and chickens when she was little.

Well. It was too late now.

The wind was beginning to pick up, and more rain whipped in, pelting Orrydys's scales. Grumbling some more, he shrank further into his cave, nestling against his hoard. Sure, his daughter might be an embarassment to dragonkind who only came to visit him once a year, but at least he had *this*.

He had his gold. He had his diamonds. He had his hoard.

And he was happy. Oh *yes*, he was happy.",3,1742692440.0,theBasiliskWrites,0,1.0,False

We've never really talked about drinking. But we both know it's an issue, not just for him. I drink a lot, used to drink more, but I've been reassessing this because the costs vastly outweigh the benefits. Plus I want to get pregnant. My step dad recently died from alcohol-related injuries. Him and my mom were alcoholics my whole life, and although it could have been much much worse, they really put me through some shit as a teen/young adult. *Now look what I married. What the fuck am I doing.* 

Considering that we've never had this discussion, I feel like I have an opportunity to bring it up and maybe incur change. We are planning on growing our lives together in these deeply important ways. I definitely don't want to berate him or anything like that at all, but I do believe that fear and shame are the most powerful emotions to motivate a change. 

I think seeing a video of himself may give him this. I know it's kind of passive aggressive. 

So many of us have ended up marrying into the type of situation that was so painful growing up. I covered for my mom so many times. It's exhausting. *Now here I am again.*

We had instant chemistry, he’s super attractive, in shape, intelligent - and our age gap is less than 10 years. Prior to meeting we had very briefly discussed expectations - because he was only in my city for a few days it was thought (on my end at least) that we were just going to have a short term/one date type of meet, which was fine. We agreed a $$$ / meet amount for this. Also worth mentioning that this was his first sugar dating experience.

Anyway. As mentioned above, it was instant chemistry and attraction. We spoke for hours in our own little bubble in a corner of a dimly lit, intimate cocktail bar and had some of the most interesting and deep conversations. I felt so comfortable with him and was so pleasantly surprised by it all.

He discreetly transferred me the amount we had initially agreed on - but after we parted ways that night I knew I needed to see him again. So the next day we had another date……He just covered my transport costs this time and of course drinks for our date, which was fine.

Since we had those two nights together 4 weeks ago, we’ve been in contact every day since - texting at various times throughout the day, sending sweet voice notes, photos (nudes and regular day to day pics), etc. 

(FYI he has made it clear he won’t be back in my city for another 2 months, at least.)

While I do enjoy having him around, I’m also beginning to question if this is what I want/need - I didn’t sign up for a penpal. After we last parted ways, he said he wanted to ‘continue spoiling me’ while we were long distance - which I thought would be quite nice and would keep things interesting - I had in mind maybe he would send me lingerie to try on for him, flowers every so often or maybe even something simple like a coffee or some food now and again.

He did send me $300 a couple of weeks ago before I went on a vacation - but apart from that there hasn’t been anything more.

I’m not one to ask for things - it’s just not my style (no judgement to those who are comfortable with it!) and I would rather someone do something naturally out of their own will/desire. 

We did have a phone call while I was on vacation last week where I suggested to him that maybe we could halt communication for the time being and ‘pick things up where we left them off’ whenever he is back in my city. His reaction seemed like he really didn’t want to stop talking to me every day and again mentioned that he ‘wants to keep spoiling me while he’s away’. 

Anyway, am I wrong for feeling a little conflicted on what to do here? How do I navigate this? I've never been in this situation before.

I guess based off what I said, it means that I’m only interested in staying in touch with him if I’m gaining something monetary or tangible from it…..is that wrong of me?

I had been on my phone so I didn’t notice the barista until it was my time to order and I was just like… shocked by how pretty he was???

I felt zero attraction/lust toward him whatsoever. He was genuinely just beautiful like a woman, idk how to explain it. Like, GORGEOUS! Curly blonde hair, long princess eyelashes. I wish I looked like him?? 

I asked how his day was going and then I said, “I’m so sorry, but you’re literally so pretty !! And I love your jewelry!” 

He didn’t respond and his face changed to discomfort. He stopped making eye contact with me and just looked down at the register. He took my order and went through the standard questions they ask you, accepted my payment, that was it. 

As soon as I got my drink I left the mall altogether. I feel so fucking HORRIBLE. I feel like some perverted freak who couldn’t read the room. 

I recently got out of a super abusive relationship and something I have missed is complimenting/talking to strangers. I was always the person to compliment someone’s hair or outfit or makeup, anything !! Because people deserve to hear these things !! I really had the best intentions. 

I can’t stop thinking about the fact that he looked so uncomfortable. I’m sure he thought I was hitting on him or something and maybe he’s in a relationship? Or thought I was sexualizing him? 

I just feel so fucking bad. I have anxiety and I’m just spiraling out over being a horrible person who put an innocent person in an uncomfortable situation against their will while they’re at work.  ",46,1742691774.0,offmychest,64,0.94,False
1jhnl0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Halluxrigidus/comments/1jhnl0x/had_surgery_earlier_today/,Had surgery earlier today,"I thought my surgeon was doing a fusion, but it was an osteotomy on my left toe. I have a lot of medical anxiety so I was pretty freaked out but everything turned out fine. I am not liking the non-weight bearing part and I don’t care for crutches, so I have a knee scooter being delivered tomorrow so I can scoot to the kitchen and grab a coffee etc. without needing my husband to get it for me. The pain is minimal. 

Two weeks from now I will get the right toe done. Glad I am taking care of this because I would like to get back into running when the doctor gives me the ok. Just wanted to post my experience for anyone who is thinking about going the surgery route but afraid of pain. ",3,1742691720.0,Halluxrigidus,1,1.0,False

Aman had always admired Emma from afar. She was smart, confident, and spoke fluent English. Every time she spoke, he felt a mix of admiration and frustration—because he couldn’t express his feelings in the same smooth, effortless way.

One day, Aman decided to confess. He gathered all his courage, walked up to her, and said…

""I… um… you… me… like… uh, coffee?""

Emma smiled politely, but Aman could see the confusion in her eyes. His heart sank. That was the moment he realized—knowing English is more than just words; it’s about confidence, expression, and storytelling.

Aman didn’t give up. He found a new way to learn English—through stories. Instead of boring grammar drills, he started watching engaging love stories, dramatic scenes, and real-life conversations. With each story, he picked up new words, phrases, and the confidence to speak naturally.

If you’ve ever felt like Aman—struggling to find the right words, feeling nervous in conversations, or holding back because of language barriers—then I have something for you.

I created Share English, a YouTube channel that teaches English through dramatic love stories, emotional scenes, and engaging storytelling. You won’t just learn English—you’ll feel it, live it, and speak it with confidence.


What’s your biggest struggle when it comes to learning English? Let’s talk in the comments!

1jhnjer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sabrinasdiaries/comments/1jhnjer/1st_diary/,1st diary,"Right now, while I’m writing this, I’m confused. That’s the best word I’ve got. It’s like everything inside me is tangled up. I feel alone, even when I’m not. There’s this weird numbness under everything—like I’m feeling too much and nothing at the same time. I can’t make sense of it, and I’m too tired to try.It’s been four months now. I’ve started noticing changes—in my body, in the way I feel. It hits hardest after ovulation. My skin breaks out with these painful, angry pimples—red, yellow, deep under the surface. And every time I meet someone, it’s the same thing: “What’s going on with your skin?” Like I don’t already see it every time I pass a mirror. Then come the suggestions, the unsolicited cures—some magic cream, some herbal tea, a ten-step routine.They mean well, I think. I’m known as the “nice” one, so maybe they think I won’t mind. But it chips away at me. Because I know what’s wrong. It’s SOPK. Polycystic ovary syndrome. It’s not something a miracle product can fix overnight. It takes time. It takes patience. And I’m trying. I swear I’m trying.But the worst part isn't even the skin. I’ve almost come to terms with the breakouts, even the ones on my back. What’s harder is everything else—the way I snap so easily, how I can’t seem to handle stress anymore, how every small thing sets me off. I can’t even listen to people without feeling overwhelmed. I don’t like this version of me. And I hate that I feel so out of control.Lately, when these mood swings hit—or whatever you want to call them—it feels like being hijacked from the inside. One minute I’m just doing the dishes, nothing dramatic, and then it happens. That sudden grip in my chest, like a tight ball squeezing behind my ribs, punching through my heart and lungs. My hands start to shake. My thoughts spiral fast: I can’t do this. I can’t do this.And when I try to talk about it, to explain what’s happening, it’s like I’m speaking a language no one understands. Their faces go blank, or worse, they brush it off. So I stopped talking. I stopped sharing. I just let it sit inside me, building up like static. I pretend it’s fine. I smile, nod, and keep doing the dishes. So like I was saying—when the mood swings hit, it’s not always dramatic. Sometimes it's just a moment, like yesterday. I came home after work, tired, already drained. There were dishes in the sink from earlier when I’d rushed to make dinner before leaving. I tried to push through, cooking again while cleaning up the mess from before. Dishes piling up, the kitchen closing in. I was running on fumes.At some point I crashed. Just lay down and passed out for two hours without even realizing it. When I woke up, my husband was at the sink, trying to help. But then came the comment—“You bring out all the dishes just to make a meal. You don’t have to do that.”And I snapped. I told him, “I made a lot of food. I needed them.” He said I only needed one or two things. And I just... I couldn't. I said, “If helping me means criticizing everything I do, then don’t help. Just leave it.” And I meant it. I did the dishes myself. I didn't want help if it came with judgment.Later I asked him about something simple—I forgot the cotton pads I usually put in the bathroom. I was trying to keep it normal. But everything felt off already. The air was tense. And it wasn’t even about the dishes, not really. It was about how fragile I feel. How one small comment makes me feel like I’m failing at everything.So I told him—I forgot the cotton pads I use to clean my face. It was late, around ten at night, and there’s a shop just downstairs. I was hoping, maybe even expecting, that he’d say something like, “Let’s go grab it real quick.” But he didn’t. He just said, “Well, you forgot it.”That hit harder than I thought it would. He knows I’m breaking out badly, that my skin hurts, that I need those pads to clean my face without leaving blood behind. But he said nothing. No offer to help. Just left me there, holding the silence.And when I try to explain the whole picture to him—what SOPK really feels like, how it affects me—he breaks it down in that cold, logical way: “It’s because you eat cheese. It’s because you don’t drink water. It’s because you don’t sleep.”I do try. I really do. I get off work at nine, come home, clean, cook, spend time with him. And when that’s over, I need a bit of time just to sit with myself. To breathe. To think. I need that hour. Then comes the skincare. Then I try to sleep. But even sleep doesn’t come easy—I wake up four, five times in the middle of the night. My brain doesn’t stop. It keeps spinning and spinning, especially during these rough days. And he doesn’t see that.He thinks it’s all just a matter of discipline. As if I’m not already doing everything I can. I barely eat sugar. I cook every single meal at home. I don’t touch fast food. I drink my tea and coffee plain. I try to make the right choices. And then when I say I want to make a certain meal that I’ve been craving, one that needs both cream cheese and cheese, he looks at me and says, “Why both? Just pick one.”And then—right on cue—“That’s why you have pimples.”Like all of this is my fault. Like I haven’t been trying hard enough. Like I don’t already feel ashamed of the skin I wake up in every day.At some point, I just don’t know anymore—what I should do, where my boundaries begin or end, how to explain what I need without feeling like I’m asking for too much. I feel lost. Really lost. And in moments like this, I don’t want solutions. I don’t want logic. I want care. I want softness. I want to feel like a girl again—just a young woman who needs a little affection, a little kindness, someone to say, “It’s okay. I see you.”I know in marriage we’re not supposed to talk like that. We’re supposed to be equal, strong, solid. But I can’t help it. I’m doing so much. I wake up early, I prepare meals, I go to work. I come home and clean, cook again, try to look after myself in between. I’m not just working—I’m leading. I manage people all day long, people with all kinds of personalities. Some are sweet, some are hard, some drain me without even realizing it. But I handle it. I carry myself like someone in control, someone who can take it all. And I do. Somehow, I do.But when I come back home, when I close the door behind me... I just want gentleness. I want love without questions. I want someone to hold me like I matter. And most days, I don’t feel that. Not really.
