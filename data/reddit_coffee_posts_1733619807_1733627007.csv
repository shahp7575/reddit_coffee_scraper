1h996ej,https://i.redd.it/0l07gpbehj5e1.jpeg,Think I figured out my machine has been struggling when steaming... ,"Installed the Barista Gadgets PID earlier this year. Right off I had issues with steaming milk. No setting changes seemed to work. It started hitting the high temp cutoff early and I'd watch the temp start dropping rapidly. It was frustrating, but I didn't have time to deal with it and I've only had time to make coffee on my days off so I've been hand grinding and using my Chemex. 

Well the other night I cleaned my machine up and was cycling water through the system when I noticed an electrical burn smell. Pulled the top and saw the connectors to the steam thermostat were melted. Thinking back, I did have a hell of a time pulling those off. They were insanely more difficult than any of the other connectors. I must have damaged something, creating a short which eventually got bad enough to melt the plastic. 

So - where might one find the correct thermostat to replace this one.... and the correct spare connectors with the high temperature plastic bits?

1h992wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1h992wq/do_breville_espresso_machines_go_on_sale/,Do Breville espresso machines go on sale?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts! I've been a barista for over 8 years, and I get this question all the time - especially from people looking to upgrade their home coffee game. So, let me share what I know about Breville espresso machine sales and how to get the best deals.

From my experience, Breville espresso machines do go on sale, but not as frequently as other brands. The best times to catch these deals are during major shopping events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day. I've noticed that discounts typically range from 15% to 25% off, which can save you hundreds of dollars on high-end models.

Last year, I managed to snag a Breville Barista Express at a sweet 20% discount during the holiday season. The key is being patient and keeping an eye on prices throughout the year. Speaking of which, I've found this awesome deal page that tracks Breville machine prices: https://athometouch.com/breville

Here's what I've learned about Breville sales patterns:

1. Seasonal Sales: Holiday seasons (November-December) usually offer the deepest discounts
2. Model Releases: When new models come out, older versions often get marked down
3. Bundle Deals: Sometimes retailers offer package deals with accessories
4. Flash Sales: Random short-term discounts pop up occasionally

Pro tip: Don't just wait for sales - consider certified refurbished machines too. They're thoroughly tested, come with warranties, and can save you 30-40% off retail prices.

Quick price comparison I did last month:
- Regular price: $699.95
- Black Friday sale: $559.96
- Prime Day deal: $579.95
- Random flash sale: $629.95

One thing I've noticed is that authorized retailers like Amazon, Williams-Sonoma, and Bed Bath & Beyond tend to price-match each other during major sales events. So if one store runs out of stock, you've got backup options.

Another money-saving hack I use is signing up for retailer newsletters. They often send exclusive discount codes and early sale notifications. I've scored some pretty sweet deals this way.

But here's the thing - if you find a good deal, don't wait too long. Breville machines sell out fast during sales, and I've seen plenty of disappointed coffee lovers miss out because they hesitated.

Just remember that even at full price, these machines are solid investments. Mine has saved me thousands on coffee shop visits over the years. The build quality is excellent, and they last for ages with proper maintenance.

Hope this helps you score a great deal on your dream espresso machine! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to help fellow coffee lovers.",1,1733626094.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

I recently discovered some amazing ways to experience the Big Apple that go beyond the usual tourist checklist. After living here for years and hosting countless friends, I've put together my top 5 recommendations that'll give you a fresh perspective on New York City.

1. See NYC from Above (My Absolute Favorite!)
I recently took the Big Apple Helicopter Tour, and honestly, it changed how I see the city. There's something magical about soaring above Manhattan and seeing landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building from a bird's eye view. The 20-minute flight gives you views that even locals rarely get to experience. I booked mine through this link (https://athometouch.com/BigAppleTour) and got a great deal. Pro tip: Book early morning flights for the best lighting and smaller crowds!

2. Food Tours in Hidden Neighborhoods
Skip the tourist traps and dive into local food scenes in places like Jackson Heights or Sunset Park. These neighborhoods offer authentic experiences that most visitors miss. I recently joined a walking food tour in Flushing and discovered amazing dim sum spots I never knew existed.

3. Street Art Walking Tours
The city's street art scene is incredible, especially in Bushwick and Williamsburg. These areas are like outdoor museums that change constantly. Plus, you'll find great coffee shops and vintage stores along the way.

4. Sunset Sail Around Manhattan
There's something special about seeing the city lights come alive from the water. Several companies offer sunset cruises, but I recommend the smaller sailboats for a more intimate experience.

5. Hidden Speakeasy Adventure
NYC's speakeasy scene is alive and well. Places like Please Don't Tell (accessed through a phone booth!) offer unique cocktail experiences that feel straight out of the 1920s.

But honestly, if you can only do one thing from this list, I'd highly recommend the helicopter tour. Getting that aerial view of NYC is absolutely unforgettable - seeing Central Park sprawled out below you, flying past the Chrysler Building, and spotting Yankee Stadium in the distance... it's surreal. 

I paid $279 for my tour (totally worth it), and you can cancel up to 24 hours before if your plans change. Based on the 4.5/5 stars from hundreds of other visitors, I'm clearly not alone in thinking this is a must-do NYC experience.

If you're interested, I'd suggest booking through this link: https://athometouch.com/BigAppleTour - they often have good deals and the booking process is super smooth.

She was everything I was looking for—witty, compassionate, and we bonded instantly over our shared love of animals. She even told me about her golden retriever, Max, who sounded like an absolute sweetheart. I’m a huge dog person, so her mentioning Max was honestly a bonus point in her favor.

After a couple of great conversations, we decided to meet up for a park date with Max. The idea of walking dogs together felt low-pressure and fun, so I brought my lab mix, Bella, along too. When I met Max, it was clear Sarah adored him, and he was just as amazing as she described. The date went great—our dogs got along, and so did we. We even ended up sitting at a coffee shop afterward, talking for hours.

Fast forward a few weeks, and things were going really well between us. But then, during dinner one night, Sarah casually dropped something that threw me off. She mentioned she’d need to swing by her ex’s place that weekend to drop Max off because they shared custody of him. I must’ve looked surprised because she quickly added, “Oh, it’s nothing weird! We broke up over a year ago, but we both love Max too much to let one of us keep him. So we take turns.”

I didn’t know how to respond at first. I told her I admired how committed she was to Max, but I also couldn’t shake this weird feeling. She noticed my hesitation and said, “I get why it might seem odd, but I promise there’s nothing between us anymore. We’re basically co-parents—for a dog.”

The thing is, I’ve been burned before by someone who wasn’t over their ex, and this situation brought up all those old insecurities. I started wondering if I was stepping into a dynamic where I’d always feel like a third wheel. What happens if her ex wants to rekindle things? Or if they start hanging out more because of Max?

A couple of days later, I told her I wasn’t sure I could do this. She looked hurt but said she understood. She also insisted that her relationship with her ex was strictly platonic and that Max was the only thing keeping them connected. But part of me felt like I’d be competing with that connection, even if there was no romantic relationship anymore.

Now I’m left wondering if I overreacted. My friends are split—some say I should’ve given it more time, while others think it’s a red flag to be so tied to an ex, even because of a dog. Was I overreacting for walking away, or did I make the right call?",1,1733625788.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

1h98yzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h98yzb/i_love_my_wife_but_i_had_sex_with_her_sister/,"I love my wife, but I had sex with her sister.","Before passing judgement, read my entire story.

I (35m) was married to Lena (34f) for a decade. And I wouldn’t have believed you if you’d told me, all of those years ago, that I would one day sleep with her older sister, Riley (40f) — that I would one day *marry* Riley.

We’ll get to that.

The nightmare began with the death of Lena, who I will forever call my *true* wife, from pancreatic cancer.

And the second chapter of grief began on an evening, two weekends ago, when I asked, “Was she telling the truth?”

“About what?” Riley replied.

From the front room of Macy Manor, I stood and watched the snowfall beyond the window; watched white bury black. Meanwhile, Riley was sitting in her father’s old armchair, by the crackling fireplace, and nursing a tumbler of brandy in loose fingers. Clearly, like me, reflecting on everything.

When Mr and Mrs Macy died in 2005, Riley inherited that lavish Edwardian house and became Lena’s guardian. It was shortly after this that Lena, my childhood friend, finally admitted the truth.

“Lena told me that the two of you could see the spirits of your parents,” I finally answered.

Riley stared vacantly at the opposite side of the room, and I followed her gaze. My eyes fell upon an empty armchair with a still shadow sitting upon it; strangely, the fireplace’s animated flames cast dancing patches of darkness across every other surface in the room.

My late wife’s sister finally whispered, “A century ago, Ernest Macy built this home upon a dark hole in the ground. In his diary, he forbade descendents from ever entering the hole, for it took a terrible toll on him. A toll that, nevertheless, gifted the Macy family with the ability to see the spectres of their lost loved ones.

“Of course, let’s be honest, that gift will die with me. I’m the last of the Macy lineage, and I won’t be having any children.”

“Lena never mentioned a magical hole in the dirt,” I said, trying to stifle a chuckle.

“Because you always wear that shit-eating grin on your face, Artie,” Riley replied, smirking as she tapping the heel of her foot against a dusty, leatherbound book on the coffee table. “This is Ernest’s diary.”

“I think that book’s been sitting there since I first visited your home,” I said. “Anyway, I’ve always respected your family’s beliefs, Riley, but I’ve never seen any evidence of ghosts in this house.”

“Well, you’re not a Macy,” she replied.

I nodded, pressing my palm against the outline of Lena’s engagement band in my pocket. “No, not quite.”

Riley continued looking at that unsettling armchair, empty save for the heavy shade upon it, then she coldly said, “Lena wants to show you, the best way she *can* show a non-Macy, that she’s here.”

Without even thinking, I immediately replied, “I want to believe. Lena, if you hear—”

The empty armchair interrupted me.

It was flung upwards and flipped upside down; hurled against the white ceiling to which its base clung tightly. And I yelled, of course, as any rational person would. Veins protruded beneath my skin as I tightly clenched every muscle in my body. Only a second later, the paranormal chair fell and landed, kicking up a mound of dust, in its overturned state on the floor.

After an unknown length of silence, I croaked, “I’ve felt her in this house. Ever since she passed.”

“The dead never really leave this place,” said Riley, “so grief is different for a Macy. Even for you, Artie. You’re as good as family.”

“What if I actually *had* been a Macy?” I asked, eyes welling. “What if I’d married Lena and taken her name?”

She nodded. “My mother married into the family, and she saw the faces of the dead.”

Then, without leaving an appropriate pause, I asked something horrific. “We should marry. You and me. That way, I’ll be able to see her too.”

I expected ridicule, or a scream of protest, once Riley realised I was telling the truth. But she seemed to immediately detect the sincerity of my tone. Perhaps the thought had already crossed her mind.

“Let’s not go there, Artie,” she warned.

I turned to the overturned armchair, addressing the shadow I knew to be cast by my wife. “Lena, it would only be a marriage on paper.”

“I’m not refusing on her behalf,” Riley explained. “And you’d need to do more than legally change your surname. We would need to *consummate* the marriage, Artie.”

“Oh,” came my meek voice, followed by the flipped armchair’s disapproving creak.

“*Oh*,” Riley repeated, laughing. “As in: oh, if only you could see the face your wife is pulling.”

I fell quiet after that, and my sister-in-law went up to bed a few minutes later. I, on the other hand, spent the rest of the night skim-reading Ernest’s diary. Lena was reading alongside me. And I felt her excitement, which rivalled mine, as we read Ernest’s section titled: *The Plea of Two*.

A gust of wind rucked a chunk of the old, brown page — rucked the passage which read:

*To return a loved one’s physical form, the ritual must be performed by two living members of the Macy family.*

However, I felt it in the air. Felt that my wife wanted a second chance at life. And, had she not, I wouldn’t have pushed it. Wouldn’t have woken Riley and explained the situation at four in the morning. She quarrelled with Lena about the ethics of it all; not so much marrying and sleeping with her late sister’s husband, but resurrecting the dead.

Lena and I should have listened.

But we didn’t, and Riley was, after only ten minutes of arguing, corrupted by that desire to end our collective grief. “If we don’t try, I’d always regret it…”

My jaw hung. “Does that mean—”

“Vegas is the quick option,” my sister-in-law interrupted. “And we’ll consummate the marriage *briefly*. No lights. No talking.”

I nodded, sobbing joyously as I eyeballed the shadowy corner of the bedroom in which I knew Lena lurked.

And a few days later, once Riley and I had successfully obtained ESTAs, we flew out to Vegas. Signed the deed. *Did* the deed. That greatest shame of our lives unfolded in an unlit hotel room, for a little less than ten seconds, and was followed by a long, silent flight back to England.

A week after we’d hatched our plan, we returned to Macy Manor. Drove along the driveway on a night darker, and snowier, than the formidable one on which we’d made this unnatural decision.

All of that discomfort and regret washed away upon stepping across the threshold, however, because there she stood. Blonde-haired in her unmistakable blue dungaree. She was a spectral light, burning blindingly into my retinas, that watched me from the main staircase.

We ran towards one another, sobbing and professing our love as we did, and those tears only flowed more heavily as our arms ran through one another — as we realised, of course, that we could not touch. Of course, I reminded myself of the only reason that Riley and I had done what we did.

We were going to bring Lena back.

The ghost of my wife stood in the front room’s doorway as Riley and I, holding hands, followed the instructions detailed within Ernest’s diary. Two Macy members reciting The Plea of Two — begging for a dark thing, which we did not understand, to return Lena to us in physical form. Begging that dark hole in the basement, which we were forbidden from even looking upon. I wondered whether every single Macy family member had, in fact, obeyed Ernest’s strict rule. Surely, in the space of a century, *somebody* else had been down there.

I was wrenched from my thoughts by the bulky diary slamming shut; a force which rattled the very house itself. In response, Riley and I gasped, turned to the doorway, then gasped again.

Lena’s phantom form wasn’t there.

Then came, from the entryway, a creak. Without any sense of self-preservation, I tiptoed towards the lobby, peered around the doorframe, and whimpered soulfully as I saw the basement door standing ajar. A door I had never, in the twenty years of visiting Macy Manor, seen open.

And through the slight gap, in the darkness of the basement staircase, there glowed a rather timid set of blue eyes that I would’ve recognised anywhere.

They weren’t translucent this time.

“*LENA!*” I wailed, feeling twice as euphoric as I had during our first reunion.

“Artie…” Riley began as I rushed forwards; hints of uncertainty and fear in her raspy voice.

I barely noticed. Barely noticed anything other than the eyes of the woman I loved. I reached for the door handle with eager blindness; didn’t even find it odd that Lena’s blue eyes disappeared into the darkness as I threw the door open.

I followed. Bounced down wooden steps in that black, forbidden part of the manor. Wilfully ignored the stench of a smell that did not belong in the earthly realm — Riley was right; grief is different for a Macy.

Moonlight, invited inside by an empty slit of a window frame, revealed a black hole in the very floor of the basement. An ancient wooden door lay open, suggesting that Ernest had kept the supernatural opening under lock and key. But I cared for none of that.

The moonlight, most importantly, revealed Lena.

All in that place was a dream — from my unthinking head to my light toes; for I was floating, perhaps literally, towards the physical embodiment of my wife. It was only as our lips met that the vision began to sour. There came a feeling that had been trying to bubble to the surface from the moment Riley and I had completed The Plea of Two.

*Terror.*

Warmth filled my mouth; a black warmth violating my senses, having circumvented my defences. And when I opened my eyes, I screamed — a scream muffled by her mouth. I looked into eyes no longer brown, but *black*. A ravenous black that swallowed the irises, then the entirety of the eyes.

Her muscular fingers dug deeply into my upper arms, preventing my escape, and then she began to step backwards; began to reverse into the hole, taking me with her.

It had all been a lie. The Plea of Two was never going to bring anybody back. It brought something else out of the hole. And that made me fear what other lies the blackness had told Ernest Macy; what terrifying rituals he might’ve performed.

There came footsteps down the stairs, and I saw Riley in the glossy reflection of the demon’s black eyes. Saw her come so close to reaching me, before being tossed, like a ragdoll, against the far wall of the basement.

The toes of my trainers start to slip into the unholy darkness, and I felt a chill beyond coldness; something that no human knows how to feel. I closed my eyes and prayed that I would meet an end — I had a feeling that surviving in that black place would be the worst nightmare imaginable.

Whilst blind to the world, however, I was startled to feel that creature’s lips and nails release my frail body, letting me fall backwards onto the basement floor. And I opened my eyes to see something horridly beautiful.

White hands, stemming from a form that brightly illuminated the dingy basement, were knotted within the false Lena’s hair — and those hands began to push the deceitful creature’s head downwards, casting the creature back to the black world.

I sobbed as the ghost of the true Lena, steel shackles binding her wrists and neck to the black realm below, revealed her form behind the creature she was submerging into the darkness. Into the nightmarish world which was claiming Lena’s bound, ghostly form too.

“I love you,” she mouthed tearfully.

I reached out helplessly as Lena’s teary eyes slipped into the opening, following the thing she had vanquished.

Then the wooden trapdoor swung closed.

For days, I have felt a deeper grief than before. A grief worsened by my inability to move forwards; Riley had been right all along.

I don’t eat. I don’t sleep. I sit in her front room, eyeing the many dead faces of the Macy family. But there is only one I hope to see, even if that hope rots my insides.

If she doesn’t walk through that door soon, I will find a way to bring her [back](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).",4,1733625717.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I was thinking about very ""mundane"" ingredients (ie: various household seasonings, things we usually throw away/into compost etc)

And, now this made sense to me, but would it be inaccurate for someone to consider the common uses an ingredient has and how that could translate into a spell ingredient?

For instance, I hyperfocused on egg shells. (because I have a ton I need to crush lol)

And I know traditionally they are often used as a protection ingredient and that makes sense as that's literally what they do, protect the growing chicken inside.

But I decided to look at common uses for egg shells and found: that they make great fertilizer, can be fed back to hens to replenish their calcium to continue laying healthy eggs, when ground into a fine powder they can balance the bitterness of coffee, be used to make a cleaning paste, homemade sidewalk chalk... and just loads of other stuff.

I also considered what the shell is made up of (a good source of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, and potassium!) 

I know that our intention behind the spells we do is a big part of spell work. 

So if we put the intent in,  would it make sense to use crushed egg shell (in combination with other ingredients) for say a spell to restore balance (because it's used to replenish a chickens calcium)  or maybe a spell to ease a broken heart (because potassium is necessary for healthy heart function)

I'm still pretty new to everything and I realize everyone's practice is different. I'm just curious if this makes sense as far as applying magical properties to ingredients or finding more ways to use them.

i didn’t know who to celebrate with so i’m putting it here 

what i’ve done:
- tried to be more social with my friends: i went out for coffee today with someone, and said yes to playing video games with a friend, saving me some of that lonely depressing evening thought spiralling
- started reading: a lot of my current issues revolve around trauma and my emotions towards them so i’ve started reading “adult children of emotionally immature parents”
- drank a WHOLE LOT of dr pepper


what ive noticed:
- i have much less of an appetite, and what i do want tends to be sugary, when i do get really hungry i can’t stomach as much as usual
- less acid reflux
- i personally feel like my facial swelling is minorly different but i haven’t asked anyone if they’ve noticed it 
- getting to sleep is WAY harder but im not waking up as often during the night 
- i want to draw a lot more, and actually have spent some time doing it and not just saying “i want to”


i’m hoping week 2 i’ll keep noticing things that are good and not just stuff that’s difficult to cope with without alcohol- the cravings definitely have amped up so i have to keep writing down and reminding myself that the little comfort i get from it doesn’t outweigh the long list of things that go wrong

# Reality: Cash & checks are still needed.

There are still real needs for cash and checks. If someone wants to tip with cash, pay for a soda at the vending machine and the card swipe doesn't work, pay the neighborhood youngster for mowing your lawn, kids need lunch money, school field trip payment, pay your kiddos an allowance, pay back a friend for dinner the other night and they want cash, Zelle, CashApp, etc. And this is just stuff I needed to do in the last week with cash or check, if I spent more time I could think of a lot more.

# Reality: Financial discipline is still required.

Being a net producer is the goal. We still gotta be more of a maker than a taker. Low-time preference is still key. Some people might mistakenly think, ""Hey, I can spend more now because Bitcoin is gonna pay for my jewelry and clothes and vacays and new cars and frufru coffees and that new house I wanted."" Especially if someone is a big spender and they let their credit cards just rack up and up and up. ... Nah, we still gotta keep track of spending and stick to the budget so that we can stack more sats.

# Realistic Theory: Mostly Bitcoin is do-able.

I think it is realistic for most Bitcoiners to go 80-95% into Bitcoin, and it wouldn't be a problem, depending on their financial circumstances.

Self-custody Bitcoin is also a huge priority for us Bitcoiners, so optimizing the ratio of cold storage to hot Strike wallet will also be something to keep an eye on.",4,1733624950.0,strikebtc,1,1.0,False

I met this woman months ago and the very first time my eyes laid on her, gosh “heto na naman tayo”. Simple lang siya and that is the most beautiful thing about her. Her simplicity separates her from our world, I could really say that she is beautiful and that is no doubt. We became friends along with my other bestie and we are calling each other mostly everyday. We go on gala, eat out, and everything. 


It started as a “crush”. A happy pill, just being attracted because of her physical appearance and personality but the more I get to know her,
the more I get to understand and accept everything about her. The fact that she loves color blue, black, simple shirts, watches, coffee, her hair style every single day hahaha. I can’t ruin our friendship dahil lang sa nararamdaman ko, I’ll let these feelings fade and support and root for her in every step of the way.

Okay, this is a lot. I'm going to try my best to explain this situation, but I can fill in gaps where needed after. so, i met this guy on a dating app. we talked here and there for a few days before meeting, when we first matched he did tell me that he would only be in town for a few days. we eventually decided to meet for coffee the day before he was leaving. we met and instantly clicked. it was quite puzzling to me just how similar we were and how seemingly perfect our chemistry was. the date was cute, we even slow danced in the middle of the coffee shop together (i asked him lol). the date went so well that i felt comfortable inviting him back to my house a little while later (not for anything but talking!) when he came he brought a bottle of wine that we drank while we talked all night. I can't tell you just how comfortable and calm i felt around him, and he would say that the feeling was mutual. we talked here and there about the fact that he had to leave the next day, in small comments. we talked about possibly seeing each other again when he's back in town for christmas and staying in touch until then. we kissed and cuddled, which was also the most perfect. he spent the night with me and left for home the next morning (8 hours away). I quickly realized that i was very shocked at how genuine, kind, and confident he was.

i've found myself in a position as i feel i found a person that i would mesh very well with. we have similar tastes, have been through similar struggles, and the chemistry and interest seemed to be there.

a few days after he got home and we had texted here and there - he hadn't texted me back for a day, so i asked him if he was still interested in talking. he said while he felt comfortable and really enjoyed our time together, he doesn't feel like he could maintain a long distance christmas like he had originally thought. he feels quite bad about what happened he said as well. (no need for him to feel bad, i'll add)

i texted back saying i understand that, and that i myself may not be in the best place right now for something but that i was still interested in being friends if he was open to that. i got no response.

what does this mean?

would i be crazy to just tell him how i feel and not try to play it cool?

would i be crazy to wait a month or so and check in with him?

should i just leave the situation be as is and move on? 

i really felt a connection with this person, which is hard to come by for me. i have always struggled feeling like i deeply connect with anybody, and this is by far the deepest i have felt. i feel sad at the thought of letting that connection die off.

I also know that it can be very impractical for a new relationship to be a long distance relationship, and i understand his reasoning - but i cannot stop this feeling.

note - i would 100% be willing to travel to see him often, i love driving and travel, so this wouldn't be an issue so long we could find times that would work :)

any helpful words are much appreciated <3
also, i forgot to add this - i am 22 and he is 25! he also is in the military which im sure plays a part as well.

I have known this girl since I was in third grade, she was my first and for the longest time my only friend in school. We were both severely bullied and outcasted from our peers, so we found comfort in one another. 

She became not only my best friend, but she was practically a sister to me. Her family honestly took me in and helped raise me when my father couldn’t. We would always hang out in school, I would go to her house after school nearly every day and I would stay there until my father could come get me. 

Nearly every weekend I was spending the night and having sleep overs with her. We laughed, cried, fought sometimes but made up, and we were absolute best friends. We planned a future where we would get married on the same day, grow up next to one another and our kids would be best friends too. 

But life had another plan. Nearly 5 years of friendship, we were forced apart thanks to my father and his wife making me leave schools and refusing to let me speak to any old friends I had. We lost contact for about 4 years, until I left to live with my mom and I was finally able to reach out again on Facebook. 

My mom drove me herself to go see my old best friend, and although we did cry and catch up, it sadly was never the same thanks to those years being forced apart. We kept in touch for a bit until we both agreed it was better to remain acquaintances rather than friends. I knew it broke her heart like it did mine, and it still hurts.. 

Yesterday, 12/6/2024, her mother called me on messenger to tell me she died. From cancer. And now my whole world is thrown through a loop. 

I have never lost someone before.. and I feel so wrong. We weren’t close as we once were, but I’m grieving so hard. I feel like I’m not grieving right or correctly if that makes sense.. I feel like I don’t have a right to grieve like her family does. I feel like I’m inconveniencing everyone else around me because I’m just useless right now. 

I barely held it together at work today and almost cried in front of customers. I just drank multiple coffees to get over it. I feel so.. lost. I see the happy Christmas lights and cheer, it was our favorite holiday, but now it feels.. empty. Lifeless. 

I don’t know what to do. My fiancé is doing his best to help, but I feel like I’m just messing it up. He knows what grief feels like, he’s sadly lost his mother and his great grandfather. But I feel like mine doesn’t compare to his, and that I just don’t need to.. 

I don’t know. I’m sorry for inconveniencing anybody who reads this too. I’m just sorry. 

I miss you Hailey. You deserved the entire world. I will forever love you as my sister, and I’ll see you later. Not soon, but later. ",1,1733624013.0,GriefSupport,0,0.99,False

Tonight I went on a 3rd date with someone to see Wicked which was planned for over a week since the 1st date. 

When the date ended, I asked if she wanted to go to dinner and she insisted she had to go straight home. She clarified that she was not sure what she wanted in a relationship and felt the need to end things. 

What irked me was how she only decided this after the movie but having made up her mind days ago. 

To give you a timeline..

The first date was to the Keg where I bought dinner and paid over $200.00 for it.  I also got her roses on the first date and she indicated she wanted to see Wicked for the second date. 

For the second date, I was gifted Leafs Tickets so I asked her if she wanted to go. She was on vacation in NYC at the time but she responded saying she wanted to go. 

I told her if she was not interested I would take my father. When we went, I bought her $50 dollars in snacks and did not ask for anything in return. 

At the hockey game this past Wednesday, I asked if she wanted to see Wicked tonight and she agreed. We then bought tickets for the movie (which I paid for).

On Thursday, she messaged me and asked if she could park at my work to go to the distillery (I manage a Condo near there). I said yes, and went with her to buy a coffee and be social. 

In between Thursday and Tonight she stated she was not sure of what she wanted in a relationship when I joked about wanting her as my girlfriend for Christmas and that I planned to ask her to be my girlfriend after the third date. 

We worked things out and carried on chatting. 

Last night she told me she was excited to see me tonight and I told her I had a magnet for her that I got in London. 

Today I met her for the 3rd date and we met at the theatre joking with each other. I then gave her the magnet which she accepted and paid for the snacks.

At the end of the date tonight, she said ""don't take it personally but I am not sure what I want in a relationship and I don't think this will work"". I then walked out on her feeling a bit taken advantage of. 

On the first date, she asked if I was clean because she was on Birth Control. I told her earlier this week that I had an appointment to get STD and HIV tested to put her mind at ease. 

Today, I got that appointment and bloodwork done. At no time did she say she was leaving or that it was not necessary.

I feel as though she tok advantage of me for free food, leafs tickets, etc. She always kept telling me how excited she was to see me and how happy she was. 

If she was not interested in continuing things she should have said no to the movie today and told me not to worry about the testing. 

**Am I wrong to think I was taken advantage of and to be angry?**

**What would you guys do and feel in this situation?**

Context - mid-30s male.

I've always had mild issues with sleep/occasional insomnia since I was young, combined with anxiety. These things come and go but it's always been manageable for the most part. I have diagnosed adult ADHD but do not take meds (tried in my early 20s and found them far too stimulating/addictive). I've always had trouble turning my brain off at night and winding down since I was a child.

My way of winding down each evening to get to sleep was drinking half a bottle of wine at night and playing my laptop in bed with a video/podcast and the voice would distract me and help me drift off.

In August this year I got sick with a viral infection. This caused me to wake during the night dripping wet with sweat for 3 nights in a row, with 2 nights of basically zero sleep in a row. I ended up with pnuemonia and got prescribed Augmentin 850mg, which cleared the lung infection but gave me horrendous anxiety, weight loss and insomnia to the point of having 3 nights of no sleep in a row. My GP gave me Temazepam which helped briefly but I felt dependant very quickly, leading my GP to prescribe me Mirtazapine.  This enabled me to sleep and calmed my anxiety somewhat but the zombie feeling the next day is truly awful and my ability to function as a father and husband was affected. I weaned off and ceased Mirtazapine after about 6 weeks. Since then I've been bouncing around all sorts of different methods to improve my sleep but am still experiencing sleep anxiety, trouble falling asleep, night waking and waking very early and can't get back to sleep.

I've found a few things that have helped:

No alcohol after about 730pm, cutting back in general too
Melatonin 2mg about 1030pm
White noise 
No caffeine after my morning coffee
Waking up at the same time every morning, 7am, and walking outside for 30 mins

I'll have a streak of a few days of good restful sleep and then will inevitably have a rough patch of inability to fall asleep or stay asleep for a few days, which makes me doubt that what I'm doing is actually helping. Of course the more you think about sleep the harder it is to actually do it...

I introduced daily fermented foods like Greek yoghurt and kimchi to rebuild my gut health, and have increased fresh fruit and vege intake.

I'm trying to see this as a journey that will end with me feeling a lot better and healthier long term, but the thing I can't understand is how this pnuemonia/antibiotics has had such a drastic effect on me. I never used to think about sleep every day, it was just something that would happen each night and now it feels like an effort or task to try and solve every night. 

I've read about magnesium glycinate and will try that soon. 

Any comments or your own story would be greatly appreciated.

So I met this girl on Tinder, and after matching and talking for a while I found out she actually worked at the dunkin in the same building I do. I asked if she matched due to knowing me or genuine interest, and she said a little bit of both. We talked about stuff for a while and eventually I got her number. We talk about random stuff every day, sometimes for at least an hour or 2, 

I’ve had coworkers say that when I’m not there, she talks about me a lot and seems quite happy when doing so. Just today I decided to take up her offer of visiting her 2nd job, a coffee shop, so we could just talk a bit. It was busy at first but then something broke in one of the machines so they had to close but they let me stay, so we were able to talk for a bit. We chatted about stuff like how long she had been working there, stuff going on in the place we both work, we talked about the town (because I don’t live in this town) and a whole lot of other things. About 2 hours later they reopened, so I called it and said that I’d better be going since I’d been in so long, and I also didn’t want to distract her in case it got busy again.

This is the first person to show genuine interest and to seem like it might go somewhere. I am the happiest I’ve been in years and talking to her makes the day just a little better, but I don’t know if this will lead to anything or not?

did i just meet a psycho??


 today I had a very weird experience with a M&G This man messaged me on Instagram stating he seen my profile on Hinge and wanted to know if I was interested in a arrangement. we were talking via text and he was offering a very hefty allowance and even said he would pay for a M&G so we agreed to meet today at a Starbucks for coffee. 

So when the time comes, I’ve driven 40 minutes and yes, I know it’s a rookie mistake to drive somewhere without any payment. We get there and he’s making all these excuses and also tried to change the location (but we ended up still meeting at the same Starbucks). He then proceeds to tell me that he was outside but he was on a phone call and he’ll come in a second. SIDENOTE: As I pulled up, I noticed a man pull up at the same time as me this man was not the man that I’ve been talking to, (but me being hyper-vigilant and aware of my surroundings) I noticed him anyways didn’t pay him too much mind. 

The man who I believed I was talking to then texts me a long paragraph stating that he thinks he left his tablet open at home and his wife  that he never mentioned seen our messages and he hast to go. He cannot meet with me so I’m sitting in Starbucks with a drink, and the man who pull up at the same time as me walk in and he’s on the phone. After a short while he walks up to me and ask if I was here for an interview and asked if my name was erica. Said “no” still not necessarily thinking anything of it yet but then he said “oh sorry I thought the way you were dressed you were either here for a date or for an interview haha”. he then asked if we can join me, this is what started to raise red flags. As we are conversing he asks if I was waiting for a date I mentioned I got stood up and he asked if I was meeting this person from my dating app. He then also begins to talk about his past relationships automatically mentioning money and how he provided for his ex-girlfriend, I’m already aware of all the red flags and my antennas were definitely up. I was just confused as to why this man pretended to be somebody else just to meet me, the way he was talking matched exactly how I was texting the man I was supposed to meet and he mentioned things specifically from conversation that I had with the man previously. I also was thrown off because what is the “coincidence” we’d be there at the exact same time at the exact same place and you’re looking for an arrangement? and you are comfortable walking up to me and assuming that I’m a sugarbaby? I never heard back from the page that I know clearly know is fake and he was still offering all the things that were stated from said man from page, however, it’s all just very weird and I don’t have a good feeling about it. We did sit at the coffee shop and talk for about two hours, but mostly bc he was slipping up on his act as we talked. i don’t understand why he catfished me???

1h97zvl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h97zvl,My Candle Day Haul! What I missed and a few thoughts on my scent choices.,"Here is my small haul from today! I haven't shopped candles since early September so I missed a whole bunch of scents. I am sad that I didn't find a Peppermint Bark or Caramelized Lavender or the Kwanzaa candle at the store today.

 I was aiming for a variety of different scent notes to balance out the other Christmas candles I still have from years past. (see 2nd pic).

All of the cookie notes smelled way too similar and familiar.  I couldn't discern much difference between Sugar Cookie, Merry Cookie, Cookie Butter Truffle, Sugared Snickerdoodle etc.so I just chose the Cookie Butter Truffle because it was the strongest new scent. The Cinnamon Roll candle also seemed very familiar (Pumpkin Cinnamon Bun?) but I currently have no PCB so I  hope this will be a good substitute.

 I considered the Vanilla Eggnog candle but it seemed so,so light on cold sniff and a bit like the cookie scents.(similar vanilla note?)

 I also considered the Caramel and Vanilla but I was afraid it might be too cloying. I really loved Caramel Drizzle so maybe it would be as good?

It was a toss up between Frosted Coconut Snowball vs. Sunny Coconut but I finally went with the Sunny Coconut because it was new for me and seemed 3x stronger- But now at home comparing it side by side it does seem very similar to Candy Cane Colada- Coconut and pineapple

I know the Emily in Paris Macaron Cloud candle has poor reviews so far, but I really liked it on cold  sniff and it actually seems like something a bit different- a Bakery note with a Candy note?
 I am hoping it's not a total dud.
 
I got sucked into purchasing Evergreen and Fir thinking it was new but it's not (identical scent notes to 2020's Evergreen)
I love the scent but my 2020 version had zero throw.

I swore off Crushed Candy Cane this year due to multiple years of poor performance so I  needed a substitute minty scent. I chose Calming Skies to represent even though it's not a foodie mint scent. (Where did you go Peppermint Hot Chocolate and Peppermint Sugar Cookie?) I am not a huge lavender fan unless its combined with marshmallow goodness, coffee or shortbread, LOL. 
Hopefully, the Lavender won't overpower the mint and it will be a pleasant scent.

I picked North Pole Punch to add a fruity note to my Christmas. I like Cherry and Cranberry scents but it does smell a bit similar to my Black Cherry Seltzer.

The Perfect Christmas- it's smells great as usual but my last version ( the 2022 gift box version) had an extremely weak throw.


I was surprised that Raspberry Thumbprint, Crunchy English Toffee, French Toast Brioche or White Chocolate Macadamia didn't return. They were really good gourmand scents.


So my final thoughts on Candle Day 2024 is that it was very underwhelming, there was nothing new and now I am regretting some of my choices.

I would appreciate suggestions for my freebie Birthday drink. I prefer a well-caffeinated coffee drink. I typically get cold brew, americanos, or splurge on a iced shaken espresso with 1-2 extra shots, sub almond milk and sugar free vanilla syrup. No dairy and no cold foam. I tend to avoid most syrups and sauces to reduce sugar, but I've heard the dark caramel sauce is really good. Any syrups/sauces/add-ons worth it? Do baristas prefer we order through the mobile app or in person for Birthday drinks with customizations?

I didn't get that impression in the main series - the soup, the coffee and welcoming her home, sneaking up on her... all felt like determined courting, at least to me.

There were about 4 people on screen (men and women) and they were in a room that was red and white themed and had a coffee table in front of them with couches and chairs around the table.

I'm doing what everyone says is ""successful"" - closed $127k last year, got the Zillow leads, working my SOI, doing all the ""right things."" But I'm fucking drowning here. Up at 6am sending follow-ups, responding to ""urgent"" client texts at 10pm, throwing $3k/month at marketing that barely breaks even. Can't remember the last weekend I wasn't holding an open house or showing properties to leads that ghost me afterward.

My sphere is actually bringing solid business, but holy shit, the amount of ""quick coffee meetings"" and ""catch-ups"" I need to do just to keep the referrals flowing is insane. This business is addicting but it's like I've built myself a really demanding job instead of an actual business.

To my fellow $100k+ agents - is this just how it is? Are we all just pretending this is sustainable? Or have some of you cracked the code to building something that doesn't require selling your soul to the real estate gods?

I’m not sure what I actually received. 

It was brown and vaguely hottish, but that is where the resemblance stopped. Vaguely sweet with a flavor something like tea without actually being tea, a chemical aftertaste that was a little like cleanser and a little like syrup of ipecac, with the faintest hint of weak coffee maybe?

I was really cold and had a long night ahead, so I drank the first cup down. The waiter came and asked if I’d like a refill - without thinking I said yes - and rather than bring a pot, he brought me a new, full and identical cup of the Substance. 

I tried a sip and my body finally got through to my brain with an urgent signal to stop, so the new cup sat on the table for the rest of our otherwise decent dinner. At one point my son observed that the liquid in the cup actually had a greenish tint when viewed from an angle.

Let's chat.,"Hey there ! 😊 I'm 26F and around the DC/MD/NOVA area. I'm looking for new friends. Either gender is fine but I'd prefer someone around my age (24+). 

I'm looking for someone I can chat with. You can ask me random questions or vent or we can just chat back and forth about the day-to-day. We could even do a virtual movie night if you're into that. I'm also open to meeting up with for coffee or a drink or something fun if you're around the area.

A little about me..

I have one sassy dog who is a bundle of energy. I frequently sing or hum while doing pretty much anything. I love podcasts (favs - DOAC and Financial Audit) and I'm currently reading ""You Shouldn't Have Come Here"". I'm also a new AFOL (if you know what that is, let me know what your favorite build is).

I like to change hobbies/interests pretty frequently so I'll just list several I've enjoyed lately: poetry, board games, acrylic painting, gaming, chess, aqua fitness, knitting.

I drink socially, but I do not smoke.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

I owned 2 of the sur la table, both broke and got returned to costco. Maybe ok while they worked -- I had the feeling one could hit a good shot more than the other. But didn't really fully find out. Probably gone from costco because of so many returns. I loved being able to brew and steam at once.

What's your favorite? What's your least favorite? Do you add creamer, sugar, etc?

I'm going to try out different creamers and stuff, to see if I can enhance the taste because I have 23 pods left, and I want to use what I bought.

***One:***

An awful, ungodly stench struck Charlie the moment he opened the creaking front door of the nearly abandoned apartment complex. He winced, reflexively jerking his face away from the entryway so that his lungs might find new air. The thief’s chest audibly rattled as he voraciously sucked in the atmosphere outside the doorway, hand still gripping the brass doorknob. Curious, Theo leaned into the building, inhaling a sample of the escaping vapors. With a chastising shake of his head, he exhaled, chuckling as he did. The younger of the two thieves ducked under Charlie’s arm and pushed forward, seizing the opportunity emasculate his colleague’s fragile sensibilities - teasing him for being so dumbstruck by an aroma. However, Theo’s chronic sinusitis had diminished his sense of smell, unbeknownst to his older colleague. So, despite Theo being able to detect the potent aroma, it was unable to restrain him like it did Charlie.

Theo admired Charlie as a mentor and felt a hint of jealousy towards him, so he found satisfaction in having something to hold over his head. His untimely demise in one of these flats would prevent Theo from ever disclosing this admiration.

“*C’mon now, old man. No time to stop and smell the roses,*” Theo mocked, now leisurely strolling down the narrow, dimly lit lobby.

He wanted to move himself along, imaging himself running ahead to overtake Theo. But Charlie could not force his body through the partition and further into the corrosive scent, the intensity of which continued to increase as more stale air poured from the dilapidated building. Charlie struggled to identify what exactly could produce such a foul odor. It was acrid and gamey, reminiscent of meat spoiled in the summer sun; but at the same time, it also had a metallic and artificial quality, similar to the inside of a bustling factory. Stagnant, putrefied water closely resembled the stench, he considered, but it didn’t quite match.

Instead of following Theo in, Charlie raised a defiant middle finger as he bent over to retrieve the Vicks Vaporub from his backpack. From somewhere further down the hallway, he heard his partner flippantly squawk about Charlie’s feminine constitution. As he listened to the continued goading, Charlie could not fathom how Theo had developed such a bravado. The man was nearly as broke as he him, he had no girlfriend, and he carted around a body shaped like a neglected pear, one that had sat in the fruit bowl for a few too many days - rotting and sagging in all the wrong places. With Theo somehow *still* chattering on, Charlie sighed and smeared the waxy material over the crest of his upper lip as a barrier against the assaulting odor.

He wasn’t much better in comparison, though, Charlie lamented to himself. Gaunt and skeletal, he stood at a monstrous six foot seven inches. Though potentially commanding, his great height was offset by a total absence of muscle. Last time he checked, his weight clocked in at just shy of one hundred and twenty pounds. If Theo resembled a decaying pear, Charlie embodied an anemic popsicle stick. Perhaps, he mused, he and Theo were actually a perfect match - both objects that had well outlived their usefulness and only truly belonged at the heart of a landfill.

He at least possessed some companionship, he reflected, however meager it may be. Charlie could not stand the notion of being truly, utterly alone. He had grown to avoid it at all costs.

Protected from the disabling scent, Charlie took a beat to more thoroughly survey the street. Not that there was that much to see. The area was completely deserted and dilapidated, devoid of any sign of human habitation. That wasn’t always the case, though. Lutzwater boulevard used to represent the cornerstone of the city’s downtown, with this apartment complex acting as the linchpin that held it all together. Charlie relocated from the suburbs to the city at age ten, and could remember well the awe that the street’s opulence and glamour inspired when he rode his bike past with friends. A lot can change in thirty years, though. What remained was a mere shadow of what this place had once been. The many competing taverns and night clubs closed, the rowhomes that once contained up-and-coming senators and actors were derelict, and Lutzwater Heights, the nexus of it all, was almost empty. Only the son of the original owners, Christian, still resided inside, at least according to Theo’s contact.

Charlie didn’t let his eyes linger on any one part of Lutzwater boulevard for too long. The destruction was just too depressing, and in a certain sense, symbolic - the beauty of life and the promise of abundance in childhood turning to ash and shit as he aged.

One tiny piece of the deteriorating scenery, however, did strike Charlie in a way that gave him pause - it was something he had never noticed before. At its peak, Lutzwater Heights showcased an immaculately groomed front garden. Ochre and lavender flowers lined the entrance, greeting longtime residents, guests, and prospective residents of the prestigious building with an equal enthusiasm. Similar to the surrounding area, the garden had devolved into an abandoned wasteland, consisting only of overgrown shrubs and discarded liquor bottles. Close to his location at the stoop of the building, on the edge of the dead garden, however, sat a well that he did not recognize. He rode past the apartment complex thousands of times during his youth, and somehow never noticed the stone hatch with the accompanying wooden frame and bucket before now. The object’s presence was jarring against the backdrop of the dilapidated, contemporary architecture - and it would have been *even more* out of place when the location was at its prime. Now, it was able to partially conceal its uncanniness among the ruins. But thirty years ago, a pillory or a telephone booth sprouting out of the garden would have been less conspicuous than the well.

That said, it couldn’t have been new. To Charlie, that was infinitely more incomprehensible.

Another whiff of the horrible aroma broke his trance and reoriented Charlie to his current purpose on Lutzwater boulevard; Christian Lutzwater and his theoretical wealth. With information passed along from another career criminal, Theo believed there was a fortune hidden somewhere in the bubbling carcass of what *used* to be Lutzwater Heights, despite his parent’s real estate ventures going up in financial flames after their abrupt and cryptic disappearance over two decades ago.

*No idea how he could live with this fucking smell*, Charlie thought, zipping his bag and placing the Vaporub in his coat pocket, assuming correctly that he would need to reapply the wax a few more times during their scheduled security system consultation/covert casing of the building and their target. Before following Theo into Lutzwater Heights, he rummaged through his wallet for coins to throw down the well, seeking to obtain good fortune from the pagan deities who might be able to affect the outcome of their so-called business venture. Without looking away from the inside of his wallet, he stood up and began to pace towards the well.

Unexpectedly, a sharp pain crackled from his big toe and radiated through his foot. Not paying attention, Charlie had slammed his boot into the well’s hard stone mid-stride. Apparently, he had misjudged his distance between the stoop, himself, and the well. Charlie felt sure that it had been a meter away, at least it had been before he started searching for coins, but the new throbbing discomfort sincerely disagreed with his previous assessment.

Apparently, the well was practically next to him.

Absentmindedly, he tossed the coins into the abyss without gazing into its inky depths. But as he did, pain and confusion had sidetracked his intended wish. Seeing Theo turn a corner and disappear from view, his mind was instead dragged back to its more fundamental concern as he provided the well with its tithe.

With his subconscious behind the wheel, Charlie wished to never be alone again.

As soon as the coins were swallowed by the blackness, the well instantly began to exude the ungodly odor, like fumes exploding from an exhaust pipe. Charlie didn’t understand what had changed, but he the let vapors propel him into action, finally sprinting to catch up with Theo. As he entered Lutzwater Heights, Charlie thought he heard the metal clink against the well’s bottom, but there was something off about that, too. The sound he heard wasn’t exactly that of a handful of coins briefly clattering against stone. Instead, a sort of quiet but frantic skittering emanated from somewhere in the darkness, like thousands of human nails tapping nervously against chalk - almost in perfect synchrony, but not quite.

\----------------------------------------------

***Two:***

Christian Lutzwater looked profoundly unwell. Huge, dark half-moons shadowed the flesh below his eyes, pulling his face down so much that he appeared unshakably joyless, the resulting creases injecting a deep gloom into every facial expression he could manifest. By Theo’s estimation, the man was only forty years old, but his emaciated cheeks and greying comb-over could have given anyone the impression that he was, at best, pushing sixty. Despite those features, his well-pressed, blue pin-stripe suit and solid black tie indicated he was still interested in appearances. At the kitchen table in the building’s largest suite, situated at the very back of the third floor, the thieves watched as Christian humbly brewed them a pot of coffee. As he did, Charlie clandestinely scanned the area, determining where they could install a remote camera or two when he wasn’t paying attention.

*“So…where do you need the cameras? In the entrance, the alleyways…?* Theo paused, hoping Christian would pick up where he left off.

Despite not being an employee at Charlie’s security agency, Theo seemed to enjoy steering the consultations, occasionally giving the impression to their soon-to-be victims that he ran the company or that security was a family business he grew up in. In actuality, Theo didn’t know the first thing about installing security systems. Yet, his self-assured manner brought the trust of their targets more often than it didn’t.

As long as Theo successfully pulled off the his part in the robberies while wearing the uniform Charlie stole for him, he happily relinquished control. Time and time again, the blueprint worked. From Charlie’s perspective, why mess with a good thing just to feed his ego?

The operation was both clever and profitable. The thieves would steal from their marks a few days *prior* to installing the purchased security systems, which helped them avoid suspicion. It was a simple and easy to execute plan: they would attend consultations with their marks, confirm that they had valuable belongings and no preexisting security measures, and then they would strike. The marks suspected their wealth needed better monitoring - that’s why they had reached out to Charlie’s company in the first place, so it was no surprise when a burglary actually came to pass. After many of their targets were robbed, their only lingering regret was that they had not called Theo and Charlie sooner, as they imagined a security system may have been able to prevent the financial losses.

*“There are several sewer grates around the periphery of the property, a majority of them near the parking lot, ""* Christian remarked matter-of-factly.

*“I need them all covered by a remote video feed that I can have access to.”*

Theo, for all his virtues, did not have a talent for improvisation, and Christian’s answer had caught him off-guard. Stunned and at a loss, Theo turned to Charlie for help.

*“…I’m not sure that will cover the front gate or the entrance, Mr. Lutzwater.”* Charlie mumbled, who was also recovering from the overwhelming strangeness of his original response.

*Who the hell would try to enter the complex through the fucking sewers?*

From across the kitchen table, Christian set his pallid gaze on Charlie, visibly upset by the insinuation that he didn’t know what he wanted. He was not accustomed to being questioned by anyone, let alone by some blue-collar nobody. Slowly, however, his expression melted from righteous indignation back to its baseline, sorrowful state. Only after a short time did Mr. Lutzwater grasp that his request could be seen as outlandish to anyone unaware of what writhed within his apartment complex.

Without breaking eye contact with Charlie, he slowly conjured a synthetic grin to his face, the corners of his mouth seemingly held up and in position by imperceptible marionette strings.

*“Of course, the entrance will need to be monitored as well. I mentioned the sewer grates first because we’ve had local children spraying graffiti on those areas - seems like I can’t get it off my mind,”* he replied, following the statement with a mechanical chuckle and a sip of his coffee.

Feeling like the flow of conversation was back on track, Theo eagerly returned to the fold.

*“You sure you don’t want a camera for your apartment, too? Can never be too safe with gangs of delinquents roaming the streets,”* Theo proclaimed with a toothy smile.

*“Oh, I don’t live here, young man. I visit the property daily to make sure everything is still somewhat maintained, but I…but I certainly don’t sleep here.”*

A subtle tremor of fear creeped into Christian’s voice when he implied he would *never* spend the night at Lutzwater Heights. Not only did the prospect of sleeping here scare him, but it appeared like he believed he said something that he should not have. He abruptly shifted the conversation to finalizing his order. After signing the agreement, he excused himself to the restroom, allowing Charlie the opportunity to plant a small camera into the kitchen’s smoke detector.

*“Okay gentleman,”* Christian proclaimed as he returned from the bathroom, sitting down across from Charlie as he did, *“I believe we have negotiated the first part of the deal…”*

“*What other parts are there, sir?”* Charlie interjected. Mr. Lutzwater had already signed and paid for the security system. The older thief turned to his left, looking to see if his younger compatriot understood what Christian meant. But he was not at the table. Charlie darted his head wildly around its axis, trying to locate where Theo had gotten off to. Just moments before, he’d been beside Charlie, yet there had been no sounds of a chair scraping or Theo’s footsteps to suggest he’d left the table while he was briefly distracted by Mr. Lutzwater’s return.

When Charlie’s gaze found its way back to Christian, terror bloomed thick and ravenous deep within his chest. His pulse quickened, blood vibrating ferociously through his entire body. He blinked over and over again, but the image in front of him did not change.

Without warning, Mr. Lutzwater’s face has evolved into something else entirely.

*“You know what I mean, Charlie. How many times have we had this conversation? I need your answer. I need your answer now.”*

The phrase seeped listlessly out of one Christian’s new cavities. All of his facial features had been replaced by three oval slits, overflowing with impenetrable, inky darkness. Two vertical slits run parallel to each other over the top two-thirds of his skull, with one horizontal slit laying flatly under the both of them on the bottom third. The steel-blue skin in between the holes was smooth and blemishless, but it appeared dangerously taut, like a plastic bag that had been filled to brim and was primed to split and rupture at any moment - or, maybe, that tightness had already caused the skin to break, resulting in the three slits that were currently staring at him.

Charlie’s aching psyche interpreted the slits as a face, but they looked just as much like the holes in a power outlet as they did two long eyes and one even longer mouth. Yes, language had come from it, but the words had not emanated from his so-called ""mouth"". Instead, the statement leaked out of what Charlie assumed was Christian’s new left eye, causing the crevasse to widen slightly and tremble as it did.

*“You made your request - a cure for loneliness. That is something we can provide, but at a cost. We will want the first of your bloodline, as payment for our generosity.”*

*“I…I…”* Charlie blubbered.

In response to his indecision, all three slits began to ripple soundlessly, like a frustrated scream imperceptible to Charlie was being unleashed from all three orifices simultaneously.

Every night since the consultation, he had experienced the same nightmare. It always started as a memory, a replaying of events, but inevitably culminated with Christian’s transformation. But this was first one where he had actually answered the question. All the times before, the vision ended before he had made a decision.

For the remaining three days prior to the heist, Charlie’s sleep would be barren and nightmareless, but it would not be restful.

In that last nightmare, he agreed to the terms.

\------------

Each day, Theo checked the hidden camera’s recorded feed. In doing so, he determined that there may be something valuable secretly stored within the third-floor suite. In addition, he had confirmed that no one else currently lived inside Lutzwater Heights. No room had been rented out for at least half a decade.

Christian was not lying when he claimed that he visited the premises daily. Every day, about an hour before sundown like clockwork, Mr. Lutzwater would enter the apartment. Without wasting a second, he would pace over urgently to a painting on the wall. He would pull it aside, revealing that it was connected to the wall on a hinge. Because of the camera’s position, it was impossible to discern what lay beyond the painting; the camera’s angle hid that view. However, Christian very clearly took a key that hung around his neck, inserted it into something on the wall, and then reached in to the wall. To Theo, that meant there must be cash, jewelry, or something similarly worth our trouble concealed in that space.

Charlie squinted at the footage proudly displayed by Theo from his old and well-worn laptop. Something caught his eye that the younger thief had neglected to mention.

His lips were moving.

*“Who do you think he’s talking to?”* Charlie asked, praying that Theo had a good explanation.

*“Oh…uh…he’s probably on a call. Bluetooth or something,”* Theo replied while scratching the side of his head, clearly unbothered by the finding.

*“Hm. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.”* Charlie halfheartedly remarked, lying mostly to himself in that moment. There was no evidence to back-up Theo’s deduction. Christian didn’t appear to have ear buds in, nor did he ever take out a phone to indicate he was taking a call, and whenever he was in that apartment, his lips were *always* moving.

But the camera never caught anyone else in that apartment, Charlie told himself.

Theo must be right.

He had broke up with me initially (DA) after a hard therapy session, then immediately regretted it, but I told him I couldn’t go back after that and we both needed time to become our own people, be independent, and heal. I recently texted him, reflecting on our relationship, where we both went right and wrong, and what would need to happen on both of our ends to reconcile after time apart. I stated my non-negotiables, as I’m now trying to focus on honoring my needs and boundaries. He’s been in a week long intensive training, and said he couldn’t unpack everything at the moment while going through the training. I let him know I appreciated his honesty and his setting that boundary, and we could talk after. I also congratulated him on this big step in his career. We texted very briefly about other things. It was nice. 

He finished yesterday. I texted him offering to meet up today over lunch or coffee, maybe a walk, or at his place (used to be _our_ place), and expressed interest in catching up and hearing about his training (I was his #1 supporter and I’m still so proud). I also said I’d be willing to talk remotely if that’s the only way he’s comfortable (he clams up in person when it comes to these difficult topics). He looked at my Facebook story, but never replied to my texts. I think he’s at work today, so I’m sitting here anxiously waiting for him to be ready to reply. If he works, he tends to avoid emotional triggers so he can focus on his job (it’s a dangerous job so I get it). 

I’m tired, I’m unwell, and I miss my person. Despite the difficult times (emotional cheating as a coping mechanism on his end, difficulty addressing his childhood traumas), I still love him deeply. I honestly want to get back together someday if he really does commit to improving his mental health. He was still overall loving and supportive. Just had his demons. I was always so ready to face them with him, until he broke up with me out of the blue. We’re both in agreement that time apart will be good for both of us. I know I need to focus on my healing and pouring love into myself. I just miss him so much, and love him so terribly. I’m sad all the time, I see and hear him in everything. I’m anxious to talk to him about everything. I’m scared of losing a person I love and cherish so deeply from my life. He really is a beautiful soul. I won’t beg him to love me, but god, I hope he still does. I hope he will fight for me. ",2,1733621141.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
1h97jnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/latebloomerlesbians/comments/1h97jnq/vent_i_feel_like_ill_never_be_free_of_the_shadow/,"[Vent] I feel like I'll never be free of the shadow of my parents' homophobia, even at nearly 30","I hope this is allowed - I just need to vent to people who will hopefully understand.  
Long post but TL;DR: I'm a (sort of late) bloomer lesbian with homophobic parents, I'm nearly 30 and an artist, and I'm anxious to share my explicitly queer art because I'm seeing my parents soon and if they end up seeing it I'm scared of their reaction irl because of how they've treated me before. Long version of this below.

I'm 29 and a late bloomer... in a sense. I knew I was into girls but I thought I was bi, and because I was a late bloomer in general i.e. I wasn't very interested in relationships/dating/sex overall until my early 20s, I never really thought about it further. I came out at 19 and the response from my parents was horrible. I did it long distance when I was in university, in a different country. They weren't happy about it but seemed neutral until months later, in November (this is relevant later), they somehow found my twitter - which didn't have my real name attached to it, and my handle was ""gay (fictional character name)"" because, well... I say this with nothing but love and respect to my younger self but I was a cringey 19 year old! Who liked a specific franchise at the time and thought a character from it acted kinda gay (funnily enough she was confirmed to be a lesbian by the writer a year later so... at least I have that vindication lol)! They sent me a bunch of angry texts about it, and about the fact I'd clicked ""interested"" on a coffee morning event run by my uni's LGBTQ+ society (I didn't realise at the time Facebook used to broadcast that stuff to all your friends, oops). 

Apart from the angry texts though, I was fine, until a month later I got home for Christmas and felt a bit awkward, my mum remarked about how I was hesitant to hug her getting picked up from the airport. But that was it, or so I thought. Until on New Years Day they sat me down and started yelling at me and saying some horrible, horrible things, threatening to stop paying for my uni accommodation and forcing me to drop out until I stop ""acting gay"", and a lot of other things. I have trauma to this day (almost 10 years later), even after years of therapy.

So I'm a late bloomer lesbian specifically because at that point I decided since I was ""bi"" I would inevitably like a man. Right??? And then they'd be happy, and I'd be happy, and... well.... not only was that the one time in my life I was profoundly in love with someone at uni (I didn't say anything because of, well, everything), I never did end up liking a guy. In my mid 20's I finally realised it's because I just... don't like them to begin with! With support from my therapist I came out again, it was lockdown and I was too scared to do it over a video call given how my first attempt went, so I wrote them a letter. After weeks and weeks of them not acknowledging it I asked if they got it. My dad stormed out of the room, my mum said we had nothing to talk about regarding that, ""maybe I gave you too much attention growing up"" (huh???), and we've... never talked about it since. Like we literally act like everything is normal, they've just stopped asking me if I have a boyfriend yet (so have my grandparents, so I suppose they've been told), though in the past couple of years my dad has been once again implying that I should marry a nice man from the country I live in. We just don't touch the subject. Other than that they act very loving and proud of me. It's really bizarre holding what I know of them/how they've treated me before, alongside with how they treat me now. They're the most loving parents in the world, so long as I'm not ""acting gay"".

After that second attempt at coming out though I figured you know what, I tried telling them twice now, I'm going to just start dating and they're going to just have to live with that. But... even at nearly 30, even living my own life in a whole different country to them still, I still have that fear of them knowing whenever I uh... transgress, I guess, and I especially fear their reaction.

Dating has... not gone great for me so far, so I've never had to cross that bridge before, either with a partner nor with my parents. But I thought that just being able to TRY dating has been a huge step. I thought I was free... except....

I'm an artist. I have my real name attached to my social media, so potential clients can find me and stuff. So my parents know my social media and follow me on there. They're unfortunately (for me) very online so there's no social media I can join without them also being there. I work in animation and illustration, and a lot of my personal work is... queer-coded, I guess, like an if you know you know thing, I'm sure to my friends and fellow queer folks it's very obvious, but if you're very straight and determined to not see it, I guess characters could appear as very good friends holding each other incredibly tenderly or something. But I've been painting something that's explicitly lesbian, and kind of erotic in nature. I want to share it, I've been excited to. But I've suddenly found myself paralyzed by fear. My parents *will* see it. I know it's stupid to be almost 30 and be afraid of their reaction but I'm going home for the holidays this year too and I don't know if I can bear to be cornered again and yelled at. The first time my dog came and sat in my lap the entire time, and she was with my while I was crying. She passed away just before I came out the second time, so I no longer have her. I'd be all alone without even her in my corner. I literally just want to share a piece of my art that I enjoyed creating. My art means a lot to me. I already have to suppress a part of myself around my parents, and now it's seeping into another part of myself that's so, so important to me, and I find myself pushing that down too. 

Maybe I'll hold off until after the holidays and share it online then or something, but I guess that's not so much the point as just... I wish I wasn't afraid. Like yeah, I do wish my parents were just not homophobic to begin with, but even more simply, even if they remain as they are, I wish I could just do something as innocuous as painting something and sharing it online and not caring how my parents react or fearing I'll be backed into a corner of my childhood home and yelled at for an hour again. It feels so infantilizing and pathetic, I've had so much therapy and yet it feels like I'll never lose that fear. 

I'm sorry for a long and self-pitying post, I just really needed to let this out. If you got this far, thank you for reading, I really do appreciate it.",1,1733621068.0,latebloomerlesbians,0,0.67,False

***One:***

An awful, ungodly stench struck Charlie the moment he opened the creaking front door of the nearly abandoned apartment complex. He winced, reflexively jerking his face away from the entryway so that his lungs might find new air. The thief’s chest audibly rattled as he voraciously sucked in the atmosphere outside the doorway, hand still gripping the brass doorknob. Curious, Theo leaned into the building, inhaling a sample of the escaping vapors. With a chastising shake of his head, he exhaled, chuckling as he did. The younger of the two thieves ducked under Charlie’s arm and pushed forward, seizing the opportunity emasculate his colleague’s fragile sensibilities - teasing him for being so dumbstruck by an aroma. However, Theo’s chronic sinusitis had diminished his sense of smell, unbeknownst to his older colleague. So, despite Theo being able to detect the potent aroma, it was unable to restrain him like it did Charlie.

Theo admired Charlie as a mentor and felt a hint of jealousy towards him, so he found satisfaction in having something to hold over his head. His untimely demise in one of these flats would prevent Theo from ever disclosing this admiration.

“*C’mon now, old man. No time to stop and smell the roses,*” Theo mocked, now leisurely strolling down the narrow, dimly lit lobby.

He wanted to move himself along, imaging himself running ahead to overtake Theo. But Charlie could not force his body through the partition and further into the corrosive scent, the intensity of which continued to increase as more stale air poured from the dilapidated building. Charlie struggled to identify what exactly could produce such a foul odor. It was acrid and gamey, reminiscent of meat spoiled in the summer sun; but at the same time, it also had a metallic and artificial quality, similar to the inside of a bustling factory. Stagnant, putrefied water closely resembled the stench, he considered, but it didn’t quite match.

Instead of following Theo in, Charlie raised a defiant middle finger as he bent over to retrieve the Vicks Vaporub from his backpack. From somewhere further down the hallway, he heard his partner flippantly squawk about Charlie’s feminine constitution. As he listened to the continued goading, Charlie could not fathom how Theo had developed such a bravado. The man was nearly as broke as he him, he had no girlfriend, and he carted around a body shaped like a neglected pear, one that had sat in the fruit bowl for a few too many days - rotting and sagging in all the wrong places. With Theo somehow *still* chattering on, Charlie sighed and smeared the waxy material over the crest of his upper lip as a barrier against the assaulting odor.

He wasn’t much better in comparison, though, Charlie lamented to himself. Gaunt and skeletal, he stood at a monstrous six foot seven inches. Though potentially commanding, his great height was offset by a total absence of muscle. Last time he checked, his weight clocked in at just shy of one hundred and twenty pounds. If Theo resembled a decaying pear, Charlie embodied an anemic popsicle stick. Perhaps, he mused, he and Theo were actually a perfect match - both objects that had well outlived their usefulness and only truly belonged at the heart of a landfill.

He at least possessed some companionship, he reflected, however meager it may be. Charlie could not stand the notion of being truly, utterly alone. He had grown to avoid it at all costs.

Protected from the disabling scent, Charlie took a beat to more thoroughly survey the street. Not that there was that much to see. The area was completely deserted and dilapidated, devoid of any sign of human habitation. That wasn’t always the case, though. Lutzwater boulevard used to represent the cornerstone of the city’s downtown, with this apartment complex acting as the linchpin that held it all together. Charlie relocated from the suburbs to the city at age ten, and could remember well the awe that the street’s opulence and glamour inspired when he rode his bike past with friends. A lot can change in thirty years, though. What remained was a mere shadow of what this place had once been. The many competing taverns and night clubs closed, the rowhomes that once contained up-and-coming senators and actors were derelict, and Lutzwater Heights, the nexus of it all, was almost empty. Only the son of the original owners, Christian, still resided inside, at least according to Theo’s contact.

Charlie didn’t let his eyes linger on any one part of Lutzwater boulevard for too long. The destruction was just too depressing, and in a certain sense, symbolic - the beauty of life and the promise of abundance in childhood turning to ash and shit as he aged.

One tiny piece of the deteriorating scenery, however, did strike Charlie in a way that gave him pause - it was something he had never noticed before. At its peak, Lutzwater Heights showcased an immaculately groomed front garden. Ochre and lavender flowers lined the entrance, greeting longtime residents, guests, and prospective residents of the prestigious building with an equal enthusiasm. Similar to the surrounding area, the garden had devolved into an abandoned wasteland, consisting only of overgrown shrubs and discarded liquor bottles. Close to his location at the stoop of the building, on the edge of the dead garden, however, sat a well that he did not recognize. He rode past the apartment complex thousands of times during his youth, and somehow never noticed the stone hatch with the accompanying wooden frame and bucket before now. The object’s presence was jarring against the backdrop of the dilapidated, contemporary architecture - and it would have been *even more* out of place when the location was at its prime. Now, it was able to partially conceal its uncanniness among the ruins. But thirty years ago, a pillory or a telephone booth sprouting out of the garden would have been less conspicuous than the well.

That said, it couldn’t have been new. To Charlie, that was infinitely more incomprehensible.

Another whiff of the horrible aroma broke his trance and reoriented Charlie to his current purpose on Lutzwater boulevard; Christian Lutzwater and his theoretical wealth. With information passed along from another career criminal, Theo believed there was a fortune hidden somewhere in the bubbling carcass of what *used* to be Lutzwater Heights, despite his parent’s real estate ventures going up in financial flames after their abrupt and cryptic disappearance over two decades ago.

*No idea how he could live with this fucking smell*, Charlie thought, zipping his bag and placing the Vaporub in his coat pocket, assuming correctly that he would need to reapply the wax a few more times during their scheduled security system consultation/covert casing of the building and their target. Before following Theo into Lutzwater Heights, he rummaged through his wallet for coins to throw down the well, seeking to obtain good fortune from the pagan deities who might be able to affect the outcome of their so-called business venture. Without looking away from the inside of his wallet, he stood up and began to pace towards the well.

Unexpectedly, a sharp pain crackled from his big toe and radiated through his foot. Not paying attention, Charlie had slammed his boot into the well’s hard stone mid-stride. Apparently, he had misjudged his distance between the stoop, himself, and the well. Charlie felt sure that it had been a meter away, at least it had been before he started searching for coins, but the new throbbing discomfort sincerely disagreed with his previous assessment.

Apparently, the well was practically next to him.

Absentmindedly, he tossed the coins into the abyss without gazing into its inky depths. But as he did, pain and confusion had sidetracked his intended wish. Seeing Theo turn a corner and disappear from view, his mind was instead dragged back to its more fundamental concern as he provided the well with its tithe.

With his subconscious behind the wheel, Charlie wished to never be alone again.

As soon as the coins were swallowed by the blackness, the well instantly began to exude the ungodly odor, like fumes exploding from an exhaust pipe. Charlie didn’t understand what had changed, but he the let vapors propel him into action, finally sprinting to catch up with Theo. As he entered Lutzwater Heights, Charlie thought he heard the metal clink against the well’s bottom, but there was something off about that, too. The sound he heard wasn’t exactly that of a handful of coins briefly clattering against stone. Instead, a sort of quiet but frantic skittering emanated from somewhere in the darkness, like thousands of human nails tapping nervously against chalk - almost in perfect synchrony, but not quite.

\----------------------------------------------

***Two:***

Christian Lutzwater looked profoundly unwell. Huge, dark half-moons shadowed the flesh below his eyes, pulling his face down so much that he appeared unshakably joyless, the resulting creases injecting a deep gloom into every facial expression he could manifest. By Theo’s estimation, the man was only forty years old, but his emaciated cheeks and greying comb-over could have given anyone the impression that he was, at best, pushing sixty. Despite those features, his well-pressed, blue pin-stripe suit and solid black tie indicated he was still interested in appearances. At the kitchen table in the building’s largest suite, situated at the very back of the third floor, the thieves watched as Christian humbly brewed them a pot of coffee. As he did, Charlie clandestinely scanned the area, determining where they could install a remote camera or two when he wasn’t paying attention.

*“So…where do you need the cameras? In the entrance, the alleyways…?* Theo paused, hoping Christian would pick up where he left off.

Despite not being an employee at Charlie’s security agency, Theo seemed to enjoy steering the consultations, occasionally giving the impression to their soon-to-be victims that he ran the company or that security was a family business he grew up in. In actuality, Theo didn’t know the first thing about installing security systems. Yet, his self-assured manner brought the trust of their targets more often than it didn’t.

As long as Theo successfully pulled off the his part in the robberies while wearing the uniform Charlie stole for him, he happily relinquished control. Time and time again, the blueprint worked. From Charlie’s perspective, why mess with a good thing just to feed his ego?

The operation was both clever and profitable. The thieves would steal from their marks a few days *prior* to installing the purchased security systems, which helped them avoid suspicion. It was a simple and easy to execute plan: they would attend consultations with their marks, confirm that they had valuable belongings and no preexisting security measures, and then they would strike. The marks suspected their wealth needed better monitoring - that’s why they had reached out to Charlie’s company in the first place, so it was no surprise when a burglary actually came to pass. After many of their targets were robbed, their only lingering regret was that they had not called Theo and Charlie sooner, as they imagined a security system may have been able to prevent the financial losses.

*“There are several sewer grates around the periphery of the property, a majority of them near the parking lot, ""* Christian remarked matter-of-factly.

*“I need them all covered by a remote video feed that I can have access to.”*

Theo, for all his virtues, did not have a talent for improvisation, and Christian’s answer had caught him off-guard. Stunned and at a loss, Theo turned to Charlie for help.

*“…I’m not sure that will cover the front gate or the entrance, Mr. Lutzwater.”* Charlie mumbled, who was also recovering from the overwhelming strangeness of his original response.

*Who the hell would try to enter the complex through the fucking sewers?*

From across the kitchen table, Christian set his pallid gaze on Charlie, visibly upset by the insinuation that he didn’t know what he wanted. He was not accustomed to being questioned by anyone, let alone by some blue-collar nobody. Slowly, however, his expression melted from righteous indignation back to its baseline, sorrowful state. Only after a short time did Mr. Lutzwater grasp that his request could be seen as outlandish to anyone unaware of what writhed within his apartment complex.

Without breaking eye contact with Charlie, he slowly conjured a synthetic grin to his face, the corners of his mouth seemingly held up and in position by imperceptible marionette strings.

*“Of course, the entrance will need to be monitored as well. I mentioned the sewer grates first because we’ve had local children spraying graffiti on those areas - seems like I can’t get it off my mind,”* he replied, following the statement with a mechanical chuckle and a sip of his coffee.

Feeling like the flow of conversation was back on track, Theo eagerly returned to the fold.

*“You sure you don’t want a camera for your apartment, too? Can never be too safe with gangs of delinquents roaming the streets,”* Theo proclaimed with a toothy smile.

*“Oh, I don’t live here, young man. I visit the property daily to make sure everything is still somewhat maintained, but I…but I certainly don’t sleep here.”*

A subtle tremor of fear creeped into Christian’s voice when he implied he would *never* spend the night at Lutzwater Heights. Not only did the prospect of sleeping here scare him, but it appeared like he believed he said something that he should not have. He abruptly shifted the conversation to finalizing his order. After signing the agreement, he excused himself to the restroom, allowing Charlie the opportunity to plant a small camera into the kitchen’s smoke detector.

*“Okay gentleman,”* Christian proclaimed as he returned from the bathroom, sitting down across from Charlie as he did, *“I believe we have negotiated the first part of the deal…”*

“*What other parts are there, sir?”* Charlie interjected. Mr. Lutzwater had already signed and paid for the security system. The older thief turned to his left, looking to see if his younger compatriot understood what Christian meant. But he was not at the table. Charlie darted his head wildly around its axis, trying to locate where Theo had gotten off to. Just moments before, he’d been beside Charlie, yet there had been no sounds of a chair scraping or Theo’s footsteps to suggest he’d left the table while he was briefly distracted by Mr. Lutzwater’s return.

When Charlie’s gaze found its way back to Christian, terror bloomed thick and ravenous deep within his chest. His pulse quickened, blood vibrating ferociously through his entire body. He blinked over and over again, but the image in front of him did not change.

Without warning, Mr. Lutzwater’s face has evolved into something else entirely.

*“You know what I mean, Charlie. How many times have we had this conversation? I need your answer. I need your answer now.”*

The phrase seeped listlessly out of one Christian’s new cavities. All of his facial features had been replaced by three oval slits, overflowing with impenetrable, inky darkness. Two vertical slits run parallel to each other over the top two-thirds of his skull, with one horizontal slit laying flatly under the both of them on the bottom third. The steel-blue skin in between the holes was smooth and blemishless, but it appeared dangerously taut, like a plastic bag that had been filled to brim and was primed to split and rupture at any moment - or, maybe, that tightness had already caused the skin to break, resulting in the three slits that were currently staring at him.

Charlie’s aching psyche interpreted the slits as a face, but they looked just as much like the holes in a power outlet as they did two long eyes and one even longer mouth. Yes, language had come from it, but the words had not emanated from his so-called ""mouth"". Instead, the statement leaked out of what Charlie assumed was Christian’s new left eye, causing the crevasse to widen slightly and tremble as it did.

*“You made your request - a cure for loneliness. That is something we can provide, but at a cost. We will want the first of your bloodline, as payment for our generosity.”*

*“I…I…”* Charlie blubbered.

In response to his indecision, all three slits began to ripple soundlessly, like a frustrated scream imperceptible to Charlie was being unleashed from all three orifices simultaneously.

Every night since the consultation, he had experienced the same nightmare. It always started as a memory, a replaying of events, but inevitably culminated with Christian’s transformation. But this was first one where he had actually answered the question. All the times before, the vision ended before he had made a decision.

For the remaining three days prior to the heist, Charlie’s sleep would be barren and nightmareless, but it would not be restful.

In that last nightmare, he agreed to the terms.

\------------

Each day, Theo checked the hidden camera’s recorded feed. In doing so, he determined that there may be something valuable secretly stored within the third-floor suite. In addition, he had confirmed that no one else currently lived inside Lutzwater Heights. No room had been rented out for at least half a decade.

Christian was not lying when he claimed that he visited the premises daily. Every day, about an hour before sundown like clockwork, Mr. Lutzwater would enter the apartment. Without wasting a second, he would pace over urgently to a painting on the wall. He would pull it aside, revealing that it was connected to the wall on a hinge. Because of the camera’s position, it was impossible to discern what lay beyond the painting; the camera’s angle hid that view. However, Christian very clearly took a key that hung around his neck, inserted it into something on the wall, and then reached in to the wall. To Theo, that meant there must be cash, jewelry, or something similarly worth our trouble concealed in that space.

Charlie squinted at the footage proudly displayed by Theo from his old and well-worn laptop. Something caught his eye that the younger thief had neglected to mention.

His lips were moving.

*“Who do you think he’s talking to?”* Charlie asked, praying that Theo had a good explanation.

*“Oh…uh…he’s probably on a call. Bluetooth or something,”* Theo replied while scratching the side of his head, clearly unbothered by the finding.

*“Hm. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.”* Charlie halfheartedly remarked, lying mostly to himself in that moment. There was no evidence to back-up Theo’s deduction. Christian didn’t appear to have ear buds in, nor did he ever take out a phone to indicate he was taking a call, and whenever he was in that apartment, his lips were *always* moving.

But the camera never caught anyone else in that apartment, Charlie told himself.

Theo must be right.

Similar to the surrounding area, the garden had devolved into an abandoned wasteland, consisting only of overgrown shrubs and discarded liquor bottles. Close to his location at the stoop of the building, on the edge of the dead garden, however, sat a well that he did not recognize. He rode past the apartment complex thousands of times during his youth, and somehow never noticed the stone hatch with the accompanying wooden frame and bucket before now. The object’s presence was jarring against the backdrop of the dilapidated, contemporary architecture - and it would have been *even more* out of place when the location was at its prime. Now, it was able to partially conceal its uncanniness among the ruins. But thirty years ago, a pillory or a telephone booth sprouting out of the garden would have been less conspicuous than the well.

That said, it couldn’t have been new. To Charlie, that was infinitely more incomprehensible.

Another whiff of the horrible aroma broke his trance and reoriented Charlie to his current purpose on Lutzwater boulevard; Christian Lutzwater and his theoretical wealth. With information passed along from another career criminal, Theo believed there was a fortune hidden somewhere in the bubbling carcass of what *used* to be Lutzwater Heights, despite his parent’s real estate ventures going up in financial flames after their abrupt and cryptic disappearance over two decades ago.

*No idea how he could live with this fucking smell*, Charlie thought, zipping his bag and placing the Vaporub in his coat pocket, assuming correctly that he would need to reapply the wax a few more times during their scheduled security system consultation/covert casing of the building and their target. Before following Theo into Lutzwater Heights, he rummaged through his wallet for coins to throw down the well, seeking to obtain good fortune from the pagan deities who might be able to affect the outcome of their so-called business venture. Without looking away from the inside of his wallet, he stood up and began to pace towards the well.

Unexpectedly, a sharp pain crackled from his big toe and radiated through his foot. Not paying attention, Charlie had slammed his boot into the well’s hard stone mid-stride. Apparently, he had misjudged his distance between the stoop, himself, and the well. Charlie felt sure that it had been a meter away, at least it had been before he started searching for coins, but the new throbbing discomfort sincerely disagreed with his previous assessment.

Apparently, the well was practically next to him.

Absentmindedly, he tossed the coins into the abyss without gazing into its inky depths. But as he did, pain and confusion had sidetracked his intended wish. Seeing Theo turn a corner and disappear from view, his mind was instead dragged back to its more fundamental concern as he provided the well with its tithe.

With his subconscious behind the wheel, Charlie wished to never be alone again.

As soon as the coins were swallowed by the blackness, the well instantly began to exude the ungodly odor, like fumes exploding from an exhaust pipe. Charlie didn’t understand what had changed, but he the let vapors propel him into action, finally sprinting to catch up with Theo. As he entered Lutzwater Heights, Charlie thought he heard the metal clink against the well’s bottom, but there was something off about that, too. The sound he heard wasn’t exactly that of a handful of coins briefly clattering against stone. Instead, a sort of quiet but frantic skittering emanated from somewhere in the darkness, like thousands of human nails tapping nervously against chalk - almost in perfect synchrony, but not quite.

\----------------------------------------------

***Two:***

Christian Lutzwater looked profoundly unwell. Huge, dark half-moons shadowed the flesh below his eyes, pulling his face down so much that he appeared unshakably joyless, the resulting creases injecting a deep gloom into every facial expression he could manifest. By Theo’s estimation, the man was only forty years old, but his emaciated cheeks and greying comb-over could have given anyone the impression that he was, at best, pushing sixty. Despite those features, his well-pressed, blue pin-stripe suit and solid black tie indicated he was still interested in appearances. At the kitchen table in the building’s largest suite, situated at the very back of the third floor, the thieves watched as Christian humbly brewed them a pot of coffee. As he did, Charlie clandestinely scanned the area, determining where they could install a remote camera or two when he wasn’t paying attention.

*“So…where do you need the cameras? In the entrance, the alleyways…?* Theo paused, hoping Christian would pick up where he left off.

Despite not being an employee at Charlie’s security agency, Theo seemed to enjoy steering the consultations, occasionally giving the impression to their soon-to-be victims that he ran the company or that security was a family business he grew up in. In actuality, Theo didn’t know the first thing about installing security systems. Yet, his self-assured manner brought the trust of their targets more often than it didn’t.

As long as Theo successfully pulled off the his part in the robberies while wearing the uniform Charlie stole for him, he happily relinquished control. Time and time again, the blueprint worked. From Charlie’s perspective, why mess with a good thing just to feed his ego?

The operation was both clever and profitable. The thieves would steal from their marks a few days *prior* to installing the purchased security systems, which helped them avoid suspicion. It was a simple and easy to execute plan: they would attend consultations with their marks, confirm that they had valuable belongings and no preexisting security measures, and then they would strike. The marks suspected their wealth needed better monitoring - that’s why they had reached out to Charlie’s company in the first place, so it was no surprise when a burglary actually came to pass. After many of their targets were robbed, their only lingering regret was that they had not called Theo and Charlie sooner, as they imagined a security system may have been able to prevent the financial losses.

*“There are several sewer grates around the periphery of the property, a majority of them near the parking lot, ""* Christian remarked matter-of-factly.

*“I need them all covered by a remote video feed that I can have access to.”*

Theo, for all his virtues, did not have a talent for improvisation, and Christian’s answer had caught him off-guard. Stunned and at a loss, Theo turned to Charlie for help.

*“…I’m not sure that will cover the front gate or the entrance, Mr. Lutzwater.”* Charlie mumbled, who was also recovering from the overwhelming strangeness of his original response.

*Who the hell would try to enter the complex through the fucking sewers?*

From across the kitchen table, Christian set his pallid gaze on Charlie, visibly upset by the insinuation that he didn’t know what he wanted. He was not accustomed to being questioned by anyone, let alone by some blue-collar nobody. Slowly, however, his expression melted from righteous indignation back to its baseline, sorrowful state. Only after a short time did Mr. Lutzwater grasp that his request could be seen as outlandish to anyone unaware of what writhed within his apartment complex.

Without breaking eye contact with Charlie, he slowly conjured a synthetic grin to his face, the corners of his mouth seemingly held up and in position by imperceptible marionette strings.

*“Of course, the entrance will need to be monitored as well. I mentioned the sewer grates first because we’ve had local children spraying graffiti on those areas - seems like I can’t get it off my mind,”* he replied, following the statement with a mechanical chuckle and a sip of his coffee.

Feeling like the flow of conversation was back on track, Theo eagerly returned to the fold.

*“You sure you don’t want a camera for your apartment, too? Can never be too safe with gangs of delinquents roaming the streets,”* Theo proclaimed with a toothy smile.

*“Oh, I don’t live here, young man. I visit the property daily to make sure everything is still somewhat maintained, but I…but I certainly don’t sleep here.”*

A subtle tremor of fear creeped into Christian’s voice when he implied he would *never* spend the night at Lutzwater Heights. Not only did the prospect of sleeping here scare him, but it appeared like he believed he said something that he should not have. He abruptly shifted the conversation to finalizing his order. After signing the agreement, he excused himself to the restroom, allowing Charlie the opportunity to plant a small camera into the kitchen’s smoke detector.

*“Okay gentleman,”* Christian proclaimed as he returned from the bathroom, sitting down across from Charlie as he did, *“I believe we have negotiated the first part of the deal…”*

“*What other parts are there, sir?”* Charlie interjected. Mr. Lutzwater had already signed and paid for the security system. The older thief turned to his left, looking to see if his younger compatriot understood what Christian meant. But he was not at the table. Charlie darted his head wildly around its axis, trying to locate where Theo had gotten off to. Just moments before, he’d been beside Charlie, yet there had been no sounds of a chair scraping or Theo’s footsteps to suggest he’d left the table while he was briefly distracted by Mr. Lutzwater’s return.

When Charlie’s gaze found its way back to Christian, terror bloomed thick and ravenous deep within his chest. His pulse quickened, blood vibrating ferociously through his entire body. He blinked over and over again, but the image in front of him did not change.

Without warning, Mr. Lutzwater’s face has evolved into something else entirely.

*“You know what I mean, Charlie. How many times have we had this conversation? I need your answer. I need your answer now.”*

The phrase seeped listlessly out of one Christian’s new cavities. All of his facial features had been replaced by three oval slits, overflowing with impenetrable, inky darkness. Two vertical slits run parallel to each other over the top two-thirds of his skull, with one horizontal slit laying flatly under the both of them on the bottom third. The steel-blue skin in between the holes was smooth and blemishless, but it appeared dangerously taut, like a plastic bag that had been filled to brim and was primed to split and rupture at any moment - or, maybe, that tightness had already caused the skin to break, resulting in the three slits that were currently staring at him.

Charlie’s aching psyche interpreted the slits as a face, but they looked just as much like the holes in a power outlet as they did two long eyes and one even longer mouth. Yes, language had come from it, but the words had not emanated from his so-called ""mouth"". Instead, the statement leaked out of what Charlie assumed was Christian’s new left eye, causing the crevasse to widen slightly and tremble as it did.

*“You made your request - a cure for loneliness. That is something we can provide, but at a cost. We will want the first of your bloodline, as payment for our generosity.”*

*“I…I…”* Charlie blubbered.

In response to his indecision, all three slits began to ripple soundlessly, like a frustrated scream imperceptible to Charlie was being unleashed from all three orifices simultaneously.

Every night since the consultation, he had experienced the same nightmare. It always started as a memory, a replaying of events, but inevitably culminated with Christian’s transformation. But this was first one where he had actually answered the question. All the times before, the vision ended before he had made a decision.

For the remaining three days prior to the heist, Charlie’s sleep would be barren and nightmareless, but it would not be restful.

In that last nightmare, he agreed to the terms.

\------------

Each day, Theo checked the hidden camera’s recorded feed. In doing so, he determined that there may be something valuable secretly stored within the third-floor suite. In addition, he had confirmed that no one else currently lived inside Lutzwater Heights. No room had been rented out for at least half a decade.

Christian was not lying when he claimed that he visited the premises daily. Every day, about an hour before sundown like clockwork, Mr. Lutzwater would enter the apartment. Without wasting a second, he would pace over urgently to a painting on the wall. He would pull it aside, revealing that it was connected to the wall on a hinge. Because of the camera’s position, it was impossible to discern what lay beyond the painting; the camera’s angle hid that view. However, Christian very clearly took a key that hung around his neck, inserted it into something on the wall, and then reached in to the wall. To Theo, that meant there must be cash, jewelry, or something similarly worth our trouble concealed in that space.

Charlie squinted at the footage proudly displayed by Theo from his old and well-worn laptop. Something caught his eye that the younger thief had neglected to mention.

His lips were moving.

*“Who do you think he’s talking to?”* Charlie asked, praying that Theo had a good explanation.

*“Oh…uh…he’s probably on a call. Bluetooth or something,”* Theo replied while scratching the side of his head, clearly unbothered by the finding.

*“Hm. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.”* Charlie halfheartedly remarked, lying mostly to himself in that moment. There was no evidence to back-up Theo’s deduction. Christian didn’t appear to have ear buds in, nor did he ever take out a phone to indicate he was taking a call, and whenever he was in that apartment, his lips were *always* moving.

But the camera never caught anyone else in that apartment, Charlie told himself.

Theo must be right.

The potential employer shared this area as one for the possible areas to consider housing as it is a very minimal commute to work. 
A little about me:
- early 30s F with a dog- no kids 
- a New Yorker. I love to walk places and explore my neighborhood. I know that CA is not a walkable city, so I do plan on getting a car 
- I have been to LA and I am familiar with it, but I have NOT been to OC yet. So, I have no idea about this area or OC in general 
- I do plan on visiting and looking for homes if I accept the offer, which most probably I will. So, I will making a list of houses to check out
- the employer recommended Newport, Irvine, Tustin, and Costa Mesa as possible areas to consider housing 
- the potential job would be a salary increase for me. And I am looking for a change in my life; I’m ready to enjoy warm winters for once! 

Any thoughts and suggestions on this area, living in OC in general, areas to avoid, costs, safety in general would be highly appreciated! 
Thank you in advance for your time and help!

On my left is Olivert Reise Arnor, the Prince of Erebonia. On my left is Rufus Albarea, the son of Duke Albarea and governor general of Crossbell. In the middle is the Blood and Iron Chancellor of Erebonia, Giliath Osborne, whose chest I’m laying on.

Olivert and Osborne have never seen eye to eye, but when Rufus proposed the idea of the three of them bombarding me with their love and affection, they put aside their differences. They only love me, the idea of loving someone else is unthinkable for them. 

Laura: Mmmmm…

Rufus: Ah, good morning my dearest princess. 

Rufus is the first to wake up. Or, more accurately, he made sure to wake up before I did so he could watch me sleep. He does this every morning. While all three are possessive, Rufus takes it to an extreme. The idea of someone even looking at me makes him angry. 

Osborne: You’re not thinking of keeping her all to yourself, are you?

Rufus: Of course not. I would never dream of such a thing. 

Osborne is the next to wake up. Despite his reputation as The Blood and Iron Chancellor, he is like a big teddy bear when around me. He is almost like a father figure, which is why I call him Daddy. He tends to take charge in most situations, which is easy for him due to his charisma and large size. 

Olivert: Ah~ It seems as if I have once again missed the opportunity to watch my beloved Laura in her most vulnerable state~

Olivert is the last to wake up. The prince feels nothing but sheer adoration for me. I could burn down a city and he wouldn’t get mad. To him, I am even more of a goddess than Aidios, practically worshipping the ground I walk on.

Laura: Good morning, everyone. 

I hug my Mishy plushie, something Rufus got me from Crossbell. 

Olivert: Oh you really are too perfect. Somehow you’re adorable even when you wake up and your hair is messy. 

Laura: Uuuuu…

Osborne: Now, now, Your Highness, isn’t it a little too early to tease her?

Olivert: And you wouldn’t do the same?

Rufus: His Excellency has a lot more tact than you do, Prince.

Laura: Uuuuu… You two tease me all the time as well!

Rufus pats me on the head.

Rufus: We can’t help it. You’re simply too cute.

Rufus: Ah, speaking of things we can’t help, we should start getting ready.

Laura: But I wanna stay in bed with you guys a little longer…

Osborne: As tempting as it may be, it’ll take quite some time for us to get from Heimdallr to Crossbell. 

Laura: How come we’re going to Crossbell?

Olivert: Because we’re reserved a nice vacation at Mishelam for the four of us~

Laura: I see…

Olivert: Ah, you must be worried about going away…

Olivert’s expression turns to guilt as I nod. 

Olivert: I’m sorry, my dearest. I hadn’t even considered it. We wanted to surprise you. 

Olivert: It’ll only be for two nights, but I am more than willing to cancel it if you’d like. 

Laura: No, it’s okay, don’t worry about it.

Laura: As long as we don’t stay any longer than that I’ll be fine I think.

Rufus: Of course.

Rufus: And if you want to go home early, we are more than willing to oblige. 

Osborne: But first, let’s get ourselves breakfast. 

Osborne calls for his servants to prepare breakfast for the four of us. I have bacon, eggs, and hashbrowns, Olivert has pancakes topped with fruit, Rufus has waffles, and Osborne has toast and coffee. 

Once we finish, I take my medicine and start getting ready for the day. Olivert picked out a cute baby blue summer dress for me. Once the prince dresses me, Rufus sat me down in front of the vanity. He delicately brushes my hair, ensuring that not a single strand is out of place. Osborne isn’t left out of taking care of me since we bathe together, but we do that at night. 

The four of us begin to pack for our stay. My husbands just bring what they need while I make sure to pack a few plushies, my blankie, a paci, coloring books, crayons, and some picture books. 

Osborne: It seems someone came prepared. You made sure to remember your toothbrush, right?

I nod. Osborne then pats my head, which makes me blush.

Olivert: You really are adorable. That backpack makes you look like a little girl on her way to school.

Laura: I’m an adult though…

Rufus: Even if that’s true, you’re still so tiny. 

I blush some more. Rufus is right though. I’m only 5’. Compared to him and Olivert, who are both 6’1, I’m tiny. When I stand next to Osborne, who is 6’5, I look like I’m his daughter. Some people have even assumed that he is, which he finds quite amusing. 

Once everything is packed, we set off for Heimdallr Station.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

I think I have IC but I don’t have a formal diagnosis. 

A little back story- I had a uti the beginning of October that took 3 rounds of antibiotics to clear. It was e-faecalis and I know that can be tough to treat and can have biofilm. After my uti cleared up I still did not feel right. I had two urinalysis after and both came back negative. I was all clear so my gyno referred me to a urologist to see what was going on. I haven’t made an appointment yet as I’m very nervous and have a lot of anxiety about the procedures needed to diagnose IC. I also think I have pelvic floor dysfunction. I had a c section over 3 years ago and I feel like I’m now starting to feel tightness from it. So I am looking into pelvic floor PT. 

My symptoms- 
Bladder tenderness/ache and pressure. 
I don’t have too bad of urgency. I think it depends on if I’m having what I think is a flare. 

I get a little bit of burning depending on what I eat. So far I know that salad dressing, citrus, and ponzu has irritated me. I’m scared to try spicy food and I’ve already cut out coffee and alcohol completely. I have a lot of food fear right now because I’m so afraid of feeling the pain. 

I’ve been taking d mannose, aloe, omega 3, a probiotic, and bromelain. I can’t even tell if any of it is helping honestly. I’ve also been drinking marshmallow tea. 

I’ll have a few good days and then a few bad days. I feel like I’m never fully feeling well and I’m getting so stressed and upset. I know the stress also doesn’t help but I feel like there’s some days where all I do is think about my bladder and my discomfort. I’m worried I’ll feel this way forever and I can’t live like this. 

I’m wondering if this is in fact IC or if it’s just taking a long time for my bladder to heal from my long uti. 

I’m trying to do as much as I can at home to try to save money as all of the PTs near me don’t take insurance and again I think I’ll eventually schedule with a urologist but I’m scared and not ready. So I’m just looking for any advice or anything I should try. 

Thanks so much in advance. I feel like from everything I’ve read in this thread everyone’s so kind and helpful. ",1,1733620544.0,Interstitialcystitis,0,1.0,False

After priming the machine (emptied first 4 espresso shots), I attempted to make two more shots and on the second shot the process was stuck in “grinding” I could hear how the brew unit was trying to push the puck out. This cycle kept repeating itself and even after I pressed cancel drink, it kept going. I had to turn off the machine in order to stop the cycle. I opened the the side panel and saw lots of coffee grounds behind the brew unit and in the tray (see picture) 

Cleaned the brew unit, emptied the puck and attempted to make a couple more drinks again. First 4-5 drinks came out fine and after that the same problem again. Machine was stuck in grinding cycle, and had to clean the brew unit again. Lots of coffee grounds behind the brew unit and in the tray. Some of the grounds in the tray were mushy.

What am I doing wrong ? I feel like the brew unit is not emptying the puck and it overflows causing the machine to not dispense. Your input is appreciated. ",1,1733620333.0,superautomatic,2,1.0,False

1h9788r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/comments/1h9788r/my_mounjaro_journey/,My Mounjaro Journey,"Hi, all -

Thank you for being a wonderful, supportive community! I've been reading up on other people's glp1 journeys and thought I'd share mine. Here goes:

I am 66 yrs. old (F), 5'2.5"" (the .5 is important, lol), current weight 130.8. Starting weight 187-189ish on Ozempic 7/13/23 but switched to Trulicity January 2024 due to insurance changes. Lost about 20 lbs. on Ozempic and gained about 15 lbs. back on Trulicity. A1C shot up to 13.0, BP was high, and I was MISERABLE. My hands ached from arthritis pain, mobility was limited in my replacement knee, and I had shooting pains in my head & scalp, and hot flashes had returned with a vengeance. Got the unsolicited 'diet and exercise is the only way' advice from both my ophthalmologist and foot doctor during visits unrelated to T2d and weight loss.

Fast forward to April of this year where I spent the last 3 weekends in the ER and was finally admitted into the hospital for tests. I'd been miserable for months due to dizziness, headaches, and chest pains. The last April ER visit was due to me almost fainting as my BP was 'seek emergency treatment' high per the internet. The room was spinning, and I swooned - just like they do on TV. On that visit the ER nurse changed my weight from 166lbs (surprise to me) to 186lbs on the chart - even though I had weighed myself and checked my BP before heading to the ER. I'm assuming he thought I was lying about my weight and just logged the last recorded weight. I just figured my smart scale was wrong.

So, nothing was found as a result of the last ER visit in April BUT the attending physician asked that I discuss Trulicity with my PCP (whom I LOVE). She ordered every imaginable test, and nothing was found. All tests results for heart conditions came back negative. Same with tests for breathing/sinus/lung issues. Tests also ruled out a brain aneurysm (they run in my family). During the follow-up PCP visit I asked for Ozempic since insurance now covered it again, but she prescribed Mounjaro 2.5mg - which I started on 5/23/24. I'm convinced it saved my life.

I bought myself an espresso machine to celebrate my 66th bday (April)/Mother's Day the next week, and spent the next 2 weeks drinking multiple cups of coffee per day, and not noticing I had very little appetite - I knew nothing about Mounjaro and how it worked, so I didn't attribute the lack of appetite and SUPER-QUIET brain to the meds - just assumed it was all the coffee. I did notice my clothes were getting loose. I remained on 2.5mg until mid-June, when I learned about titration and requested 5mg.

Asked to move up to 7.5mg in early July because the intrusive thoughts/food noise returned quickly on 5mg. and I got scared. By the end of July my weight had dropped to 158lbs. which my PCP noted as 'significant weight loss' - though I still thought I looked exactly the same. Down the Reddit and Instagram rabbit hole I went. I bought supplements, prioritized protein, forced myself to eat, and worried about loose skin since the weight seemed to be dropping quickly and I wasn't lifting weights – I became concerned and began comparing my journey to others. I had to make some changes.

I started to eat only when I was hungry, although I did add a breakfast of cottage cheese and peaches - hungry or not. Started drinking lots of water w\\electrolytes - which revealed the upper back pains from April were due to constipation (TMI, I know) and the water provided MUCH needed relief. Also started a little strength-training at home with exercise bands and free weights - I have a gym membership (haven't used it in 2 years) AND a home gym but was determined not to start a program I wouldn't implement consistently. Same with my eating habits - I ate whatever I wanted, but never overate, and didn't diet.

Time passed and the appetite suppression disappeared - which I was ok with since I was no longer dependent upon movie-theater candy to quiet the noise in my head. I knew my body was changing but still couldn't see it until late October/early November. I have WFH since the start of the pandemic but am now required to be in-office 2 days/week. When I saw my reflection in the mirror-enclosed elevator at work I did a double-take. I could finally see the results! I then managed to work up enough nerve to post before/after photos on this sub.

I'm happy with my body at this size, and love my reflection in the mirror again, though I'm noticeably still losing fat - about 1lb/wk. **-** most noticeably from my abdomen. My PCP and I thought maintenance was 140lbs since the scale stayed within 136-140lb for a few weeks (and this was my favorite weight when I was weight training before menopause hit 9 years ago), but I guess we were wrong. Still taking my 7.5mg shot every week, and hoping to move down to 5mg weekly injections for maintenance - which I think my doctor will support. I'm also eating more. We shall see.

Most importantly, I feel better than I did when I was decades younger. As a surprise NSV I found myself crawling into bed leading with my replacement knee - I never put weight on that knee on purpose, but here it was working unconsciously! All my numbers are 'normal', the aforementioned aches and pains are gone, and my thoughts are quiet now - I had NO IDEA the noise in my head wasn't 'normal'. When the intrusive thoughts return now, I recognize them as hunger queues. I eat - they're gone.

Again, I'm so thankful for this community. I will continue to read everyone's glp1 journeys as I navigate (hopefully) maintenance and wish you all great successes!",19,1733620093.0,Mounjaro,4,0.95,False

1h976hi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h976hi/i_loved_my_father_but_he_came_back/,I Loved My Father but He Came Back,"I always believed we needed to let go of the ones we've lost, no matter how much it hurts. But no one warned me what to do if they came back—how grief, pain, and sorrow, things I was so sure were real, could suddenly feel like lies.

I was seven when he died. Back then, I never truly understood how much his presence meant to me. The memory of his last days still haunts me: the antiseptic hospital smell, the hushed murmurs of passing nurses, and his last words, perfectly clear despite his weakness: ""Take care of your mother for me, buddy."" After they took him away, I found Mom on her knees in the hallway after the doctors spoke to her. I remember thinking how strange it was to see an adult break that way.

Life blurred after his death. Mom crumbled, and I learned to raise myself - cooking, homework, childhood crises.

Some nights, I'd find her in Dad's armchair, still in work clothes, staring at his photo. She'd kiss me back to bed, her tears marking my forehead despite her mumbled excuses about dust.

Growing up without him was difficult, but we managed. The years passed, and we settled into our routine. I kept his memory alive in small ways—wearing his broken watch, using his old things. Mom said grief does that, though she never explained why. Maybe we're both still figuring it out.

As I got older, the memories of him began to fade. His eyes... I couldn't remember if they were brown or hazel. Mom kept his photos, but somehow, they never seemed to capture him in the right light. I held onto them as a reminder.

Then came that day in my sophomore year when everything changed. Walking home that crisp autumn day, a familiar scent stopped me—applewood smoke, though no one on our street had a working fireplace anymore. At the corner, our house looked wrong. Time seemed to have reversed itself: Dad's bluebells swayed in the dead garden—spring flowers in autumn—and his wind chimes sang without wind.

The scent hit me as I opened the front door—fresh coffee and pancakes. We hadn't had coffee made here in years. From the living room came a sound I'd almost forgotten—Mom's genuine laughter, accompanied by a deeper voice that made my heart stutter.

The hallway stretched endlessly. Dad's cardigan hung on the banister—warm to touch. His crossword puzzle lay unfinished, the pen still warm, his shoes exactly where he always left them. Each detail clicked into place with terrifying precision.

In the living room, Mom curled against him on the couch. There sat my father, impossibly real—reading glasses perched on his nose, that untamable eyebrow, even the coffee stain Mom always scolded him about.

""Welcome home, buddy,"" he said.

Mom beamed beside him, her hand in his, looking younger than she had in years. The weight of grief seemed to have melted away. She looked at him the way she used to, the way I'd almost forgotten—like he was her entire world.

""Dad?"" I whispered, my voice shaking not from terror but from the weight of what I was seeing.

He smiled at me with that slightly crooked incisor he'd chipped playing baseball when he was twelve. ""I missed you so much,"" he said, his voice catching slightly, exactly the way it used to when he was trying not to cry.

Mom announced dinner was ready, casual as anything. The smell of his favorite meatloaf drifted from the kitchen—the recipe his mother had passed down, the one Mom had never quite mastered in all the years since. But now it smelled perfect.

I couldn't move. Because I remembered holding my father's cold hand at the funeral. I remembered watching them lower his casket into the ground. I remembered nine years of grieving, of missing him, of learning to live without him. And here he was, impossible but real.

I backed into the door. ""How are you here?"" My voice cracked. Dad's face shifted to that familiar concerned expression as he stepped forward, hands open—exactly how he'd approach my childhood tantrums.

""What's wrong, buddy?"" His voice held that perfect mix of worry and love I'd fought to remember. Mom appeared, wiping her hands on her anniversary apron—the one that should have been yellowed with age but looked brand new.

I kept my distance, the door my anchor to reality. Everything felt real. That was the problem. I looked at my mother—really looked at her. She looked happy. Genuinely, completely happy, in a way I hadn't seen since before the hospital.

I wanted to run, to escape, yet I couldn't leave her here with... with whatever this was. Even if it felt like Dad. Even if it smiled like him and moved like him and remembered everything exactly right. I lunged forward and grabbed her hand.

""Mom, we have to go,"" I said, pulling her toward the door. She resisted, her eyes filling with tears.

""Honey, what's gotten into you?"" Her voice broke just like it used to when I disappointed her. ""Why are you trying to ruin this? We're finally whole again.""

I dragged her outside, past the garden where those impossible bluebells bloomed. The street was empty except for the glow from neighbors' windows. Mom fought against me, repeating ""it's okay"" over and over. When I looked back, my father—or whatever wore his face—stood in our doorway, watching us with that familiar hurt expression.

""Mom, please,"" I begged. ""He died. You remember the funeral. You remember everything after.""

But my words faltered as she looked at me with genuine confusion. ""What are you talking about? Your father's right there. He's always been here."" She touched my forehead like checking for a fever. ""Are you feeling okay? You've been working so hard at school lately...""

""No... he's dead. Mom, he's dead..."" The words felt less certain now, seeing him there in the doorway, looking exactly as a father should when worried about his child. Everything I remembered about the funeral seemed to blur, like a dream fading in the morning light.

His footsteps on the path carried that familiar unevenness from his old injury. ""Come on, buddy. Let's go home. Whatever's bothering you, we can figure it out together. We always do.""

I felt something in my mind shift as his footsteps drew closer. Slowly, each memory of my father began adjusting to accept this new reality. ""Son,"" he said, and his voice carried all the warmth I'd been missing for nine years.

""He's dead,"" I whispered, but even as I said it, I noticed Mom's expression—patient, waiting, like she knew exactly what I was going through, like she'd made this choice before. But I couldn't accept this. I wouldn't disrespect my father's memory, the hardship we'd faced. The pain we'd endured.

""Please Mom, wake up. This isn't real,"" I said as I tried to pull her, but this time I couldn't move. No, the truth was I wouldn't move—my body betraying me.

""Your father's been worried about you,"" she said softly. Her eyes met mine, and for a moment—just a moment—I saw everything there. Understanding. Grief. Choice. ""Sometimes,"" she added carefully, ""happiness is right in front of us, if we just... let it be.""

He was closer now, and I could smell his aftershave—the same brand I'd kept unopened in my drawer for years. Yet the memory felt uncertain now, like trying to hold onto water. I tried to remember the funeral, but the images kept shifting, then fading.

""Do you remember how he used to push you on the swings?"" Mom asked, her voice gentle. ""How he never pushed too high because you were scared of heights?""

""Every Sunday,"" Dad added, and suddenly I could see it clearly—the creak of the swing set, his hands steady on my back, my laughter carrying across the yard. Had that happened before or after? Did it matter anymore?

I looked at him—really looked. He wasn't perfect. There were new wrinkles around his eyes that my memories hadn't included. His hair was slightly grayer than in the photos. He looked... lived in. Real. Like he'd been aging alongside us all this time.

""Dad?"" I said again, but this time it wasn't a question born of fear.

Something in my mind whispered that this was wrong, that there was another set of memories trying to claim space—cold hands, a casket, years of absence. But those memories felt distant now, like a dream I'd once had. This felt real—his smile, Mom's hand in mine, the smell of dinner waiting at home.

""Come on, buddy,"" he said, holding out his hand. ""Your mom's lasagna is getting cold.""

I looked at Mom one last time. There was something in her eyes—knowledge, maybe, or understanding. A tiny nod, so slight I might have imagined it. A choice being offered.

I took his hand. It was warm.

That night, my reflection caught my eye—something questioning in my gaze. Then Dad called about tomorrow's fishing trip—the one we'd planned for weeks, the one we'd always done, every year, forever—and I let the doubt slip away.

After all, why question happiness?

Dad's home. He's always been home.

And if sometimes, late at night, I remember another life—well, that's just a bad dream. Mom says they fade.
