1qgwmow,https://i.redd.it/fpcy1izc29eg1.jpeg,Bro I made the biggest mistake in my entire bloodline 🥀,"So everywhere I go I can’t seem to find “the one”, which I suppose is normal and fine for now, and it’s not like there aren’t any good girls who are into me either.

So one day during church (I’m orthodox) I find out that my church has become very popular with the youth because our priest is younger, and right next to me across the aisle was a girl, and I’m not talking about just some girl, this is the first girl that made me feel something no one else had made me feel, and she was gorgeous, god put 100% into the making of her, and instantly for no reason I felt nervous and found it super hard to breath and when I looked over she was staring into my eyes and smiling, actually making eye contact. She did that throughout the whole sermon.

Then when the sermon finished I walked out with my little sister to go to the playground on the property while my parents got a coffee at the cafe and she was walking around there, then her grandma and dad came and talked to her an she walked away, then as I was about to go home she walked back to me and looked me up and down and smiled. My retarded ass did absolutely nothing about it, nothing can describe the feeling of regret I feel.

The worse part is that every time I go to sleep she is there, and every time I daydream she is there. And I want to see her again but I feel like I might never, so I am js listening to music until the regret goes away.",1,1768803979.0,teenagersbutworse,0,1.0,False

I am starting a second keto journey,  About 6 years ago I lost 120lbs on keto, and was able to keep it off until about a year ago when life got in the way and I backslid.  So I've been back on Keto for a few weeks now.

I use Cronometer to track all my food, I weigh all my food and I am tracking NET carbs.  My goal is below 20 net carbs and I usually hit that goal every day, with only going over by no more than 5 net carbs since I started back. 

I am eating a caloric deficit, and I am loosing weight in a healthy manner....so far.  

My typical daily diet would be eggs sauasge/bacon and coffee with heavy cream (liquid saccharin for sweetener).  Lunch is usually a salad with some cheese and a fatty dressing like ranch or Bleu Cheese, sometimes a balsamic that I have verified has very very to no carbs.   Dinners are usually a clean protein like a steak, chicken or pork served with green beans, collards or some other low carb veggie.  

Here are my negatives though:  I drink Coke Zeros and I use liquid saccharin and heavy cream in my coffee, and I drink a big 28oz cup of coffee from breakfast to lunch-ish.  I noted that neither Coke Zero nor the Saccharin causes any blood sugar spikes though.  

I use a Dexcom Stelo to track my blood glucose and a KetoMojo blood ketone meter.  

I'll share am imgur album of screenshots showing my blood glucose, its still staying in the 140 range, and very very rarely dips down below about 125.  HOWEVER, In those screenshots, I'll include how horrible my blood sugar was BEFORE i started keto.  It bounced all over the place, would regularly stay above 250 (the highest the Stelo reads). So its very apparent that my diet has changed my blood sugar for the better I think?  On Keto, my blood sugar stays pretty consistent even after meals, its just on the high side.  You can even see how the average has dropped over the last 7 days.  

I feel great, really don't get hungry and have good energy levels.  Feel better than before I went on keto.  BUT, I am concerned that my blood sugar is consistently on the high side.    
  
Is it due to having a crappy diet full of sugar for the past couple of years?  Should I even be concerned at this point and maybe it will continue to trend downwards?  

Whenever I check my blood ketones, they are always around the .3 to .5.  I understand thats only measuring the excess blood ketones though.  

I'll also include some screenshots of recent meals from cronometer if someone could please kindly take a look and see if I am unknowingly sabotaging myself.

1qgwhgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_genericusername2212/comments/1qgwhgr/twin_flame_soul_mate_soul_tie_wtf_is_this_help/,Twin Flame? Soul Mate? Soul tie?? WTF is this? Help!,"I have never told anyone this to this extent- but I am struggling with this consuming me for over 15 years. 

When I was a teenager, I met a boy. 

At the time, we were both in high school relationships 

My high school bf was horrible to me, but I had such low self confidence I didn’t think I had any other choice or option. 

I suffered from depression, anxiety and an eating disorder. 

This other boy and I would discuss all things in depth, and I never felt understood like this with anyone else. I have always been a very philosophical person, and to meet someone else so young like this felt like I had made a connection with the only other person on this earth that understood me- he made me feel heard, and seen. 

He was my only safe zone. He also suffered from depression, and when him and his gf broke up he came to me for help. 

We grew up together, and would often see each other in passing outside of school. We ended up working together. 

Years on, he confessed his feelings to me- I was still in my horrible relationship (which I couldn’t see at the time) but would often confide in him until this point. I pulled back because I felt that I didn’t want to lead him on, even though deep down I struggled with my feelings for him. I struggled with knowing if we eventually got together, we would both have mental struggles. So I found it hard to keep him close, but not give him any false hope.

He eventually got into a relationship in our early 20s, just as I finally got out of my horrible high school relationship.

He went overseas and during this time I started dating someone else, unbeknownst to him. 

When he came back, he confessed his feelings to me again. And gifted me an incredibly heartfelt present for my 21st birthday.

I had to tell him I was seeing someone, and we cut off ties for a while. Eventually I became single again. As he started dating someone else. We both struggled not being able to confide in each other, and knew the magnetic pull was still there. 

I started seeing another person about 6 months later, and once that didn’t work out he realised I was single again, and broke it off with his current partner  honestly by saying it was because he still had feelings for me. 

At this point, we were both single but I had planned to go overseas. 

We kept in contact while I went overseas, and after I got back I ended up leaving the place we both worked at after 5 years to start fresh. (I was about 24 by this point, we had known each other almost a decade) 

As he didn’t/still doesn’t have social media, I had no idea what he was up to, and for SOME REASON I had this stupid ‘revelation’ at the time (from listening to so many podcasts etc about self help and all that-) I had come to a conclusion we were never meant to be together for a reason, and that I knew I was meant to be with someone who wasn’t so serious. 

Note: He NEVER made a move on me either, but had told me he was ‘madly in love’ with me, got me gifts- I think because he wasn’t assertive physically (like I had experienced with other men in the past) I was a little frustrated or somehow just wanted him to step into a masculine side and be assertive/make a move?? I was definitely always attracted to him) 

I ended up reaching out to him, asking to catch up for a coffee. He agreed. I found out before this catch up he had started seeing someone who was a mutual friend. 

I was sort of hurt by this?? because deep down I wanted him to still want me after all this time- I was selfish. So, as a response to this hurt- I said I was glad we just stayed friends all these years. 

After this, I really only saw him a handful of times over a few years. He was still with the same girl. No social media though. My old phone died, so I no longer have his number. And I have no idea how to contact him other than an old email address. 

I am currently 30. I dream about him every now and then, and I wake up and miss him so much it hurts. We were so close for so long, and the connection I had with him I’ve still never had with anyone else. 

I saw him at a shopping centre once a year or so ago- I don’t know if he saw me- or he saw me before I saw him and avoided me. 

What even was this experience?? what am I searching for if I reach out? I’ve never come across someone like him again, or felt the level of connection with another man like I have with him. My soul misses him. But I would feel disrespectful if I reached out if he is still with his current partner. 

I have search for him in every other man I’ve dated. Which is incredibly unfair to them. 

I accepted for a while I’d never see him again, and just got on with life. But one dream and all these feelings and memories came flooding back so intensely. ",1,1768803515.0,u_genericusername2212,0,1.0,False

\- Blair: a little blond in the front. Cute. 

\- Serena, same. I don’t get why they won’t brush her hair tho… 

\- Chuck: more quaffed. Cute

\- Dan: curly and sideburns. I’ll allow it

\- Jenni: blonder and choppier. Cute! But I don’t like the purposefully ratty looking extensions. They are clumped together for some reason 

**Nate**: 

\- before (s1 & s2): I think they had multiple stylists and couldnt commit to a style. Most of the time it looked he had the “straight bangs, curly hair” look. **Theory— they added tracks to the front of his hair to give him bangs so he could look more boyish. Then brushed it forward starting at the crown of his head to hide the tracks.** This was a no for me. Two different textures in one head. (Here’s where I talk about looks) Chase Crawford is so hot and grown looking, it would’ve been weird seeing him with the rest of the cast looking like teens. Esp during his arc with Jenni. They passed for high school kids, but production had to keep Penn and Chase’s shirts on or it would’ve looked like grown men surround by teens. Had to give Chase goofy hair to look like a teen bc otherwise he’d look like the hot coach. These are compliments.) 

\- now (season 3 ep 1): BETTER!!!! Cute!!!! It all looks natural and no more bangs. His hair looks sexy pushed back. The character has graduated high school so now Chase is free to be fine 

**Vanessa**: 

\- before: cute!!!! Her hair was cute!! 

\- now: they ruined it. I think this happened for two reasons **theory 1: production didn’t rehire anyone who knows how to work with her hair texture.** There was a continuity error where inside the coffee shop her hair looks like shit, then she goes outside and it looks great. I’m assuming this was a reshoot or something. **Theory 2: the show was going for the ratty haired socials aesthetic.** Blair and Lily’s hair is polished bc their characters are polished. But Serena, Jenni, Vanessa, and Georgina all have really messy hair. So did Brittany spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton once upon a time. **So I’m assuming they were going for the early 2000s socialite look.**

I have snagged a Bambino Plus as my first espresso machine and currently looking at grinders to purchase.

Based on my research here as well as James Hoffman/Lance Hedrick, it seems like  the DF54/DF64/Baratza pops up the most as some of more valuable grinders to start off with. However people are mentioning that dark roast beans tend to be oily and tend to clog up the DF54 quickly.

  
Understand that due to Bambino Plus not having a way to variably change the temperature, it is not suitable for light roasts but only medium to dark roasts. As my current fiancee tends towards cafe lattes and milk based espresso drinks, my primary goal of buying the Bambino Plus + grinder is to mainly make milk based espresso drinks.

  
Would the DF54 be suitable in my case? Also, as for espresso milk drinks, would medium roast - dark roast beans be ok to use for lattes? My concern is that since the Bambino Plus is mainly used for medium-dark roast beans, the DF54 seems to be catered for lighter roasts, and I am not sure if we can find a middle ground as I believe milk based espresso drinks require medium to darker beans, but might clog up the DF54.",1,1768803134.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

They found him three days after the video went viral.
Marcus Webb had lived in the same log cabin outside Stillwater for eleven years. He fixed generators, grew tomatoes, and kept to himself. On May 14th, when the F4 tornado carved through the valley like God's own drill bit, Marcus walked into his backyard and raised both hands toward the funnel.
What happened next broke physics.
The tornado split. Not dispersed—split. A clean vertical line appeared in the column of shrieking wind, and the two halves peeled away from each other like theater curtains, dissipating into ordinary thunderclouds within seconds. Forty-three people in the trailer park downstream lived because of it.
The helicopter arrived on Day Three.
""Mr. Webb?"" The woman wore a gray suit that looked government-issued. She stood at the edge of his property line and didn't cross it. ""My name is Director Voss. We need to talk about what you did.""
Marcus set down his coffee. ""I helped people.""
""You did."" She smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. ""That's why we're here. To help you help more people.""
He didn't pack a bag. He knew what ""voluntary cooperation"" meant when it came with drones overhead and satellite tracking. The exclusion zone went up that night—500 yards, environmental hazard, authorized personnel only.
They never put him in a cell. They didn't need to.
The facility had comfortable furniture, good food, a gym. It also had biometric locks, thermal sensors, and doctors who wanted to know if he could split other things. Earthquakes, maybe. Hurricanes. They showed him footage of disasters—Bali, Honduras, Nepal—and asked the question with their eyes: Don't you want to save them?
Marcus stared at the screen showing a mudslide burying a village and felt the trap close around him.
""I can't be everywhere,"" he said.
""No,"" Director Voss agreed. ""But we can get you there. With our resources, you could save thousands. Tens of thousands.""
He thought about the mother in Stillwater who'd hugged him, sobbing, before the government took him. He thought about his cabin, his tomatoes rotting on the vine. He thought about becoming a tool in a toolbox, deployed and stored, deployed and stored, until the day he resented the disasters as much as the people who pointed him at them.
""And if I say no?""
Voss folded her hands. ""Then you stay comfortable. Stay safe. And people die who didn't have to.""
There it was. The choice that wasn't a choice.
Marcus closed his eyes and saw two futures: one where he disappeared into obscurity, haunted by every catastrophe he could have prevented. Another where he became something other than human—a resource, a weapon, a miracle in a cage.
He opened his eyes.
""I want to see the sky,"" he said. ""Real sky. Once a week.""
Voss considered this. ""We can arrange supervised outdoor time.""
""No."" Marcus stood, and for just a moment, the air in the room felt different—charged, potential, dangerous. ""Real sky. Alone. Or you can explain to the world why you're keeping the man who saved Stillwater locked in a box.""
The silence stretched. Somewhere, an alarm system hummed.
Finally, Voss nodded.

For small tenants (coffee/quick service/clinic/convenience/local retail), what are your most reliable signals for:

* demand strength (footfall, daytime population, destination vs impulse, anchors)
* competitive context (good vs bad competition, saturation thresholds)
* access/friction (parking, ingress/egress, visibility, cross-street penalties)
* “paper looks good but it fails” red flags

1qgw71k,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qgw71k/fetlife_is_not_a_dating_site/,FetLife is not a dating site!!,"TL;DR: FetLife has no filters so you need to screen for your normal dating red flags before meeting up with someone on FetLife in person, lest things go from D/s (Dominant/submissive) to a vanilla (regular boyfriend/girlfriend) relationship.  FetLife is social media for a kink lifestyle - and a place to meet like-minded people. 

It started out as expected. Boy on FetLife sees girl, boy likes girl, boy follows girl. Girl follows back and sends boy a message. Boy responds. Chemistry follows.

I noticed she was new to FetLife - just signed up. She said she had a prior 24/7 D/s with someone that was mostly online (met in some online game) and they met in person a couple of times to do whatever. I didn't press for details. I've been doing this for a while - so it's not my first rodeo.

2 weeks of messaging (went off-platform after a few days). Talk about scenes, D/s, etc. She called herself an Alpha Sub - OK... Type-A personality looking for total power exchange. Works for me. I'm drawn to those personalities and she was happy to let me be her Sir. She made her personal life an open book.

We arrange to meet at my place (I vetted her with some Google and public records searches - no red flags... I would hope she did the same). Our first time was a great time and we were clearly attracted to each other, physically, sexually and intellectually. The messaging grew more vanilla / romantic. More scenes at my place with increased frequency - like 2-3x a week - and the in-person dynamic grew more like boyfriend/girlfriend. From a single-guy's perspective, after getting to know her better - she checked all the boxes. Sure... why not?

Then came the kink club (really an adult movie theater with a dungeon in the back). Our first time there together (she had been there once before) - so some nervousness. The club wasn't my thing - heard enough stories about it... but new owners turned it around and it wasn't bad. Some weird single male middle-aged rando's hanging around but whatever. It's par for the course. Did a couple of quick scenes, learned a few things from some nice couples who were there... interesting and I liked it. Agreed to return in the near future.

And so we did - but on a much busier night. We did a couple of scenes - but it was rather distracting. Too many randos getting in our space and she was already irritable from the stress from the holidays and was already exhausted from the holidays to begin with. That caused her to step out of her sub role and her alpha side came out to me in front of others. Not good. We agreed to let another female do a rather intense impact scene with her then leave. In hindsight we never should have gone that night.

She had to be home by a certain time (reality of having kids) and time for proper aftercare wasn't there.

Then - sub-drop... big time... more like sub-crash.

When we were dating, she told me about her PTSD, a TBI from a bad car wreck and ADHD - and she's going through a divorce. She's a professional, very intelligent and well put together - so on the surface she wasn't waving any red flags.

Everything from her sub-drop and onwards were textbook trauma reactions. She collapsed inward and pushed me out. Dismissed us as fuck buddies, that she wants kink only - not vanilla, that her life is private and she doesn't want people from the 'lifestyle' mingling in public, etc... and she'll try to make time every 2-3 weeks if she can (as opposed to getting together 2-3 times a week). We haven't seen each other in nearly 3 weeks and communication has dropped to a trickle from what it used to be.

The 'private life' thing was interesting. Within a week of meeting in real life, she found me on Instagram and sent me a follow request. I'm like 'yeah, no - too soon' and ignored it. A month later after her sub-drop, I noticed it was still there, and was like OK - follow back. The next morning she tore in to me that I was seeking her out on social media, it's also part of her professional life and that she doesn't want people from the lifestyle in her public social media. I said \*\*YOU\*\* found and followed me! ""No I did not!"" Um... ooo-kay? Unfollowed her - whatever (she never unfollowed me though... weird). But prior to all this - I know everything about her life, her kids, etc... short of their social security numbers and blood types. She sent dozens of pictures of her day to day life. D/s only fuck buddies don't do this!!!

So, the red flags were more like staring at the front of a fire truck with all of it's lights flashing and sirens blaring. Oooof...

I asked for clarification - she gave me short, curt and sharp responses - but insisted we were fine. Clearly things were not fine.

Her job and home life is overwhelming even for healthy people and that added to her stress from her trauma responses after the impact scenes at the club.

Did a lot of soul searching, imported our chat logs into ChatGPT and asked it to break down what happened... and it echoed everything I suspected with trauma reactions and overload from the last intense impact scene. Over-analytical? Sure - but I needed answers and she wasn't giving any. Further researching indicated this wasn't just regular sub-drop where a 2-3 days later you're back in business. It was all PTSD at play.

Her PTSD stems from her time in the US Marine Corps and she was tasked with recovering bodies (really body parts) from the Pentagon after 9/11. Pretty deep and heavy shit. That was exacerbated by a hit-and-run accident that left her injured and a traumatic brain injury as well. She didn't ask for any of that - so this isn't *her* fault. Fuck buddies don't casually bring this stuff up while out to dinner... this is how deep she got with me.

Last week I said the growing distance isn't working out for me and she went into repair mode - but briefly... ""I'll make time this weekend, may have time on Thursday"". OK - maybe things are settling down and we can start moving forward again. Nope... things came up, availability closed. Not good. I'm pretty much done at this point.

She clearly isn't ready for a D/s dynamic, an Alpha Sub role, or even a vanilla relationship. Take away the PTSD and ADHD... well let me clarify that - unmanaged PTSD and ADHD... and she's actually a wonderful and accomplished woman. I'm usually a good judge of character and in a vanilla dating context this stuff wouldn't make it pass my filters.

The intensity of our first 6 weeks bypassed those filters and being a generally awesome person (with a few flashes of 'snippiness' while out to dinner or whatever) had me relaxed enough to write stuff off as she's having a long week or whatever.

At this point, I don't know where things stand and they're not looking good. I recently stopped trying and I'm essentially quiet-quitting because further pursuit is simply costing me too much emotional and mental energy. If she notices or cares - we'll see... but I'm guessing it's done. Normally I'd say 'it's over' but she would just insist we're fine, I'm overacting and overanalyzing... make some more false promises and keep stringing me along. Nah... homey don't play dat.

So... lessons learned. FetLife is a good place to meet people - finding events (munches, etc...), learning about the lifestyle, etc. BUT... it is not a dating site. Yes - we meet people, we have fun with them - it stays compartmentalized. The downside to FetLife is there are no filters like you find on a vanilla dating site like [match.com](http://match.com/) \- and because of the sex-oriented intense dynamic that starts right out the gate, filters get bypassed. Normally for me, I screen for these things - either in my vanilla dating profile and/or in chats afterwards... or signs may come out over coffee when first meeting.

Thing with FetLife is - there are a LOT of people who have past trauma and/or neurodiversity (not judging - I have C-PTSD and Asperger's). And many are drawn to kink because they need to compartmentalize things or are drawn to the rules / structure of kink.

In my sub's case (really former(?) girlfriend??)... she also ignored her own internal need to compartmentalize, stepped out of the Alpha Sub role, pushed for the vanilla aspect when she realized that I provided her with warmth, security and compatibility. Like I said, she checked most of my boxes and it flourished.

However, in a vanilla-only dating context, my filters would have screened her out because of her past trauma and attention deficit. Been there, done that with past relationships - and it's not my vibe. Like I said - she *is* actually a wonderful person... but now that hindsight is becoming clearer, not my person given her emotional instability... and I mean that with kindness. Even after all is said and done, I still care for her and I miss her. She was different from my other subs.",1,1768802604.0,dating_advice,3,0.67,False

I want to create a bunch of content in 2026 but I feel that this process of writing scripts, posting the content, filming it etc. is all a bit more motivating if you got other creatives around you that are making content as well. Getting an audience or going viral multiple times is a process which requires a lot of patience and dedication, which I think is easier if you can share the struggles/wins. So hear me out

I am looking for people actually trying to put effort into it, wether it is talking head vids with a camera and tripod with nice framing, or creative shots, nice editing, good storytelling.

Not low effort videos like, 100 days of x or pranks etc. etc.

It would be nice if you already have:

\- Posted 5 video’s and 100 followers (just to show that you have already started)

\- Content where in you appear (no ai, animation, faceless)

\- Passion to create video’s (but like me getting stuck on procrastination, analysis paralysis , overcomplicating the process etc.)

Whether you are a grandpa that likes to give out life advice while drinking coffee on his porch or a person that makes cool videos essays in your room talking about societal problems or philosophy, I don’t care. There just needs to be a PASSION from you to really be one of the biggest creator in your niche. And we need to motivate/push each other to achieve that!

TLDR; Make cool content, post it, keep each other motivated even when views are low, give feedback, weekly reflection, adjust, improve, repeat.

If so, reach out and lets make some content!!!",1,1768802348.0,GetMotivatedBuddies,0,1.0,False

I've trained my body to produce a BM in the early morning. I usually have to blast out a BM shortly after waking up. I don't even drink coffee. Just water, tea, a protein shake, and some fruit causes me to have to hurry to my outhouse, yeah, I said outhouse. I'm a woodsman. Most days, this is the routine: Wake up, eat, and shit. My BMs come flying out and are like soft-serve ice cream, just like they should be. No constipation around here! Occasionally, on the weekends, when I go buck wild and eat cake, cookies, donuts, ice cream, and lots of junk food, I'll have a night shit in addition to the morning shit. Sometimes that will mess up the morning shit the next day, then I'm a night shitter again! I hate being a night shitter! It feels wrong to me. Do you prefer to blast out a BM in the morning or at night before bed? Do you poop at the same time every day? Is it usually once per day, or more often? I like to shit once per day and in the early morning. I do believe I've trained my body to perform that way most of the time.  ",1,1768802214.0,poopstories,5,1.0,False

Lately, I’ve caught myself being far more frustrated than I’d like with day to day life here - excessive noise, little inefficiencies and cultural differences that feel sharper than they should. It’s made me feel like I’m standing on the outside, looking in and mentally highlighting every single little thing that’s different or annoying.

The usual response to this is the age-old advice: “just get used to it.” But earlier today I had a bit of a light-switch moment.

I’ve been travelling and living overseas for about nine years now, and during that time I’ve made videos along the way. Today I watched a few of my older ones and saw a very different version of myself. Yes, we all change with age, but what stood out was the joy. The curiosity. I was clearly on an adventure, soaking up the quirks and nuances of new places.

Back then, I wasn’t angry about haggling over prices, annoyed by slow check-ins, or fuming about terrible roads on a 12-hour bus journey. I wasn’t cataloguing grievances about how things ought to be better. I was just a guy who knew he was living his dream - fully present in the moment.

It just felt like something clicked for me.

I realised that maybe I’ve been doing myself a disservice by forgetting to enjoy this life I actively chose. I stepped outside afterwards and everything feels more vivid again. The construction noise while I’m sipping my coffee writing this is just in one ear and out the other. Two lads are blasting TikTok at full volume and I genuinely don’t care. Instead, I’m finding myself watching the street and feeling curious again about things I’d never see back home.

So this is when it hit me: maybe ‘just get used to it’ isn’t always the right goal….Maybe the answer is the opposite. Maybe we shouldn’t try to dull ourselves to the differences, but actively lean into them - enjoy the weirdness, the contrast, the chaos and the texture of life here.

Obviously this isn’t universal. There will always be things that cause genuine frustration, but maybe it’s worth occasionally pausing for a second, taking a breath, and remembering why we chose this path in the first place.

Anyway, I’m feeling a bit more invigorated today and hoping I can carry this mindset forward. I’m sure many of you already do this and are doing just fine here, but I wanted to share this for others who’ve been in the same endless loop as me!

1qgvunu,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/1qgvunu/heres_my_hiring_experience_as_a_data_analytics/,"Here's my hiring experience as a Data Analytics Manager at a big, known company.","TL;DR: Stop doing weird shit on your resumes, and focus on understanding and speaking to business impact and strategy over just technical skills. Feel free to fight in the comments.

Maybe this is more helpful for new grads or entry level. Those in the space for a while already know the game. Sorry this is a long post, dont read if you dont want, all good. 

Getting headcount(a new person on the team), is not easy at all. Even if we have a need(someone leaves/gets fired, etc), it can take months before HR approves/denies the budget to rehire and fill the role again. We typically have to write a business proposal/charter on why we need to keep that additional headcount. 

Anyways, why does the hiring process take long? In an ideal world it shouldn't take long, but in corporate america when youre hiring process is reliant on scheduling in interviews in-between your daily work and everyone in corporate america is already always doubled up on work 24/7 + being reliant on HR and agency recruiters to complete their own processes, it can definitely drag out the process. Many big companies don't handle their own resume overview. We contract with staffing agencies to sift through resumes for us and pull xyz number based on the standards we tell them were looking for in candidates. 

I have a strict 3 interview max limit(If you're a manager and you need more than 3-4 interviews, you're a wiener). Once recruiters give me a pile of ""qualified"" resumes, I'll do a general formal 30 minute phone screening coffee chat ""hey here's who we are/what we're looking for/tell me your background as it pertains to this role"" type of conversation. I'm just trying to hear your thought process and see where you foundational knowledge is. The 2nd interview is a behavioral one, and the 3rd is a mix of business process + conceptual technical. I don't bother doing a coding technical test as long as the baseline knowledge is there. In 2026, there's way too many resources to help you technically that the technical part isn't usually an obstacle, its your soft/people skills that are.

Now here's what I see, and this is anecdotal but I think in speaking with my counterparts its pretty similar. Is the economy ass for new grads and entry level? 100%, no denying, its tough. There's also a lot that a candidate does to shoot themselves in the foot. 

\- Stop submitting resumes as a word document. 

\- Stop adding your picture. This isnt modeling. 

\- Stop doing that stupid HP health bar thing of showing what level of proficiency your python skills are. Seriously, why would you put python - 3/5. 

\- Stop filling white space with whited-out buzz words, we catch that dude. 

\- If you put a project on your resume, you should be able to confidently speak to every aspect of it. 

\- Stop putting your resumes in different fonts at different areas of your resume and color coding your sections. 

\- On your bullet points, write about your impact, not what your job description was.

And yes, we get many(actually most) applicants that are international students on a school visa(typically bachelor's in india somewhere, and doing a masters here at an american university). Unfortunately, many companies won't sponsor you for an entry level data position, its not cheap to sponsor and it prolongs the hiring process even further. 

Don't over focus on your technical skills. Your business skills are far more important. Consider it like a T-shaped method. You want to have a horizontal technical knowledge(solid foundation), but a deep/long understanding of working with people, cross team collaboration, stakeholders management, learning domain knowledge, etc. Because you could be the best coder on planet earth but if you don't know your business and how the data you provide is being used, its worthless. 

Since new grads wouldn't really have experience with this, in your interviews you'd want to speak towards understanding that you need to first gather domain knowledge, learn the flow of your data in your organization, and learn how your data gets used. This will separate you from 95% of candidates who think data analytics is just writing god mode sql queries. 

You'll be surprised how much of analytics is ad hoc requests and just trying to get clear requirements from non technical departments who aren't even sure what they need but they need it from you fast anyway. 

And I'll just put it out here, I personally dont care what you studied or where you went to school, I've met amazing peers from all walks of life and ive found that those with different and unique backgrounds are amazing contributors because they bring fresh perspectives and great social skills. 

Lastly, I can't tell you the amount of candidates who have a kick ass resume on paper and then in person they can't make eye contact, they can't speak clearly, they can't speak to their resume, etc. Practice your soft skills please. Your personality and how you'd fit into the team dynamics is very important. If we hire wrong, we could blow up our entire team culture. 

I'm sure there will be data veterans on here that can add to this. 

Remember too, most of your analysis ends up on a simple excel sheet to some 55 year old vice president who doesnt know how to turn their cameras on and off on teams. So dont try to know every little technical concept to the point that you're pulling your hair out. We have seniors analysts for a reason and you'll get there one day.

That day the storm erased the city. Snow sideways, visibility fucked, streets reduced to instinct and brake lights. After a deranged afternoon at the office, the only option was the bus. Go home. Survive the commute. Pretend tomorrow still mattered.

Inside the bus: humidity, overheated air, coats dripping misery. People pressed together like livestock. Everyone nauseous in their own way. I scrolled through my phone—news, recipes, useless content meant to anesthetize the brain. Routine as a sedative.

Outside: snow. Wind. Traffic. The bridge.

Nothing worked.

No one thought about speed anymore. Just arrival. Point A to point B. No detours. No meaning. Everyone shared that silent agreement—until the clown got on.

A fucking clown. In winter.

Greasy makeup, cheap costume, eyes too alert. A joke that didn’t know it was dead. Where I come from, no one would’ve looked twice. Here, the bastard started screaming. Not funny screaming. Broken screaming. Like a thought loop snapping.

The driver tried to calm him down. Then tried authority. Then gave up and called his supervisor.

Lights cut through the storm. Authority arrived fast, barking commands. They spoke to the clown like you speak to a dog that already bit someone.

He answered with laughter.

Then four shots into the ceiling.

Not aimed. Not random. Performative.

And then he ran. Am I in a fucking simulation?

Silence. Snow muffling panic. Holes dripping melted ice onto terrified commuters. Worst part? We were stuck. Between stops. Forest on both sides. Urban planning at its dumbest—nature as an afterthought, people trapped in between.

The clown vanished into the trees. No chase. No heroics. Just fear sitting next to us, breathing.

The driver took us to base. Explained our options. File a report. Or go home and thank God.

Everyone chose home.

Ice, darkness, slush-filled craters pretending to be sidewalks. I walked uphill the last blocks, exhausted, angry, numb.

I opened my door.

The clown was sitting in my living room.

No smile. No screaming. Just waiting.

My wife couldn’t move. I dialed 911 from my jacket and let the line stay open. The clown watched me like he knew how this scene ended. I didn’t negotiate. I didn’t warn him. I broke his face until he stopped being a presence.

Police came. Took him back to the psychiatric ward. Took me too—for excessive force. Statements. Warnings. Paperwork.

Lesson learned: society prefers monsters intact.

I slept hard. Dreamless.

Morning. Coffee. Bus stop.

The bus was empty.

That’s when I saw the driver—hogtied in the back.

And the clown driving.

Saw his face. Calm. Focused. Fucking Ronald MacDonald driving!

Something in me snapped clean in half.

No fear. No questions.

If this is a joke, I’m done laughing.

I’m not interested in returning to Duolingo. Its engagement mechanics ultimately led to burnout for me, so I’m specifically looking for alternatives.

I’d like to restart Spanish using a mix of approaches (podcasts, courses, audio-first resources, etc.), ideally something similar in structure to Coffee Break Spanish. Accent-wise, I’m genuinely open to a variety of Spanish accents, as long as the resource isn’t focused exclusively on Spain/Castilian Spanish. I don’t mind listening to Spanish from Spain, but being expected to consistently produce that accent doesn’t work well for me. I’m neurodivergent, and flexibility around accent helps me stay engaged with learning.

I’m open to podcasts, structured courses, YouTube channels, or other resources, as long as they’re affordable (ideally under about $5/month, or free).

If you’ve found something that worked well for you—especially resources that expose learners to multiple accents—I’d really appreciate the recommendations.

“Beckett, you’re getting married in two weeks. What’re you gonna do about the sugar baby you’ve got tucked away?”

My feet stopped like they’d been nailed to the floor, my fingers tightening so hard around the glass I thought it might crack, because I already knew that tone—men laughing like women were a problem to file away.

Beckett’s voice followed, lazy and detached. “Keep your mouths shut. As long as none of you run your mouths, Sage Hollis won’t find out.”

One door. That was all that separated me from the man I’d loved for years, and in that thin space my whole life went weightless. 

Tears blurred my vision so fast I couldn’t even blink them back.

He wasn’t just cheating—he was planning it, managing it, turning me into a secret he could control. The humiliation hit first, hot and choking, and then something colder settled in underneath it, something that didn’t cry or plead or bargain.

I didn’t knock. I didn’t storm in. I turned away and made an appointment to erase myself, because later I’d learn the one who couldn’t crawl out of this wasn’t me.

······

“Ms. Hollis, I need to confirm,” the woman on the phone said gently. “Once we start, it takes about two weeks. Your legal name change and relocation paperwork goes through, and the people who know you won’t be able to track you down the way they can now.”

They won’t be able to find me again.

Perfect.

I let out a small, bitter breath that almost sounded like a laugh, then forced my voice flat. “I’m sure.”

She paused, then continued, businesslike but kind. “Okay. Your new documents and transition plan will be ready once it’s complete. I hope this gives you a fresh start.”

A fresh start. I wanted to believe in that so badly it hurt.

When I hung up, I stood up too fast, my legs prickling from crouching there so long. I walked out to the curb, flagged a ride, and went home like I wasn’t carrying something broken inside my ribs.

I’d barely finished showering and was about to slide into bed when the door pushed open. The smell of whiskey hit first, then Beckett himself—warm, familiar, confident.

“Wifey,” he slurred, wrapping me up and pressing his face into my neck. “Why didn’t you come pick me up? I kept waiting. I swear, I did. You smell so damn good…”

His hands started roaming, greedy and comfortable, like my body was already his consolation prize.

I stared at the ceiling and let him nuzzle into me, and my mind drifted back to the beginning—the version of him I’d trusted with my whole life.

Beckett Northcott had chased me for three years. He’d brought coffee to places I never told him about, showed up in the rain, looked at me like I was the only woman on the planet. 

When his mother tried to shut us down, he’d held me tight, “If my mom won’t let me marry you, then I just won’t get married. We’ll date forever. I’m never marrying anyone but you, Sage. You hear me?”

Then Mrs. Northcott stopped targeting me and dragged him home instead, pushing the Ransom family arrangement like it was a business deal she’d already signed. 

When he finally came back to me, he looked wrecked—pale, hollow-eyed. I found out later he’d been refusing to eat, like starving himself was his way of proving he still belonged to me.

After that, no matter what his mother threatened, I didn’t back down, because I believed someone was fighting beside me.

How stupid.

How lucky I was to hear that conversation tonight, because if I hadn’t… how long would he have kept acting? 

Until the wedding day? Until someone pointed at me in public and called me the mistress, and I finally understood I’d been set up to take the fall?

I swallowed the ache and gently pried his hands off me. “I’m tired tonight.”

He didn’t push, and somehow that made it worse. He guided me onto the bed like I was delicate, then climbed in behind me and wrapped himself around my back, warm and possessive.

“You’ve been looking thinner,” he murmured, soft with concern. “Get some sleep, okay? I’ve got you.”

I didn’t answer. I let my eyes close and pretended I was already gone.

The next morning, I woke up to him at the closet, changing like nothing in the world had shifted. He heard me move, turned, and came over with that easy confidence of a man who assumes he still owns tomorrow.

He kissed my forehead. “Morning, wifey. It’s Chriatmas Eve. I’m taking you out. Get up and get dressed.”

He said it like a decision he’d already made for me, then walked out before I could say no.

Downstairs, the housekeeper smiled and set out breakfast. “Ma’am, you’re up? I’ll get your breakfast.”

We weren’t married. We’d never been married. 

But Beckett had always ordered the staff and his people to call me “ma’am,” sometimes even “Mrs.,” because he liked the illusion. He liked having me framed as his—quietly, privately.

In two weeks, he’d have a real wife in public.

I lowered my eyes and let out a breath that tasted like irony, then ate like I wasn’t swallowing glass.

After breakfast, he sent the driver away because he wanted “just us.” He drove me around the city, took me to a garden café, then the aquarium. 

He watched my face constantly, like he was tracking my mood, and every time I looked even a little tired, he immediately slowed down, made me sit, bought me something, asked if I was okay.

That was what made him dangerous. He could take care of you so well you forgot he was also the one hurting you.

That night, when I thought we were heading home, he turned the car toward the hills.

Seeing my confusion, he smiled like he was proud of himself. “You said once fireworks from up there would be insane. I’ve been saving it. Let’s go see if you were right, yeah?”

It was something I’d said casually while scrolling YouTube—so casual I’d almost forgotten it. Somehow he hadn’t. He remembered every little thing that made me happy, right up until it got inconvenient.

I didn’t answer. 

He didn’t seem to care. He kept talking anyway, trying to coax me out of my silence, filling the space like he always did when he wanted me soft again. Beckett wasn’t a talker with anyone else. With me, he could go on forever.

We reached the lookout in about half an hour. The city lights below looked like scattered glitter across black velvet, and for a second I could almost pretend this was still my life.

When the last hour of December 24th started ticking down, Beckett’s phone buzzed.

He glanced at the screen, then flicked his eyes at me—quick, guarded. When he saw me staring out at the view, he let out a tiny breath and angled his phone away as he typed.

I barely had to tilt my head to see it anyway.

Beckett, honey. I’m so lonely tonight. Can you come be with me?A flirty emoji sat at the end like a wink.

I watched him type back: Don’t start.

She replied instantly. Please. Raina’s scared of the dark. I want my baby with me.

He hesitated for two seconds, then typed: Be good. Wait for me.

Before he could look up, I turned my face back toward the city like I hadn’t seen anything.

His voice came behind me, smooth and apologetic, already rehearsed. “Sage, something urgent came up at the company. I have to go back. I’m sorry—I can’t count down with you.”

“Mm.” On the outside, I looked calm, like I believed him. The only betrayal was my hands braced on the hood, fingers clenched so tight my knuckles went white.

Beckett didn’t even linger. From the moment he said it to the moment the taillights disappeared, it wasn’t a full minute. 

He was so eager he forgot one small thing—he took the only car, and up here no rideshare ever came, not this late, not on a holiday.

My chest tightened like someone had grabbed my heart and squeezed until it ached to breathe. The pain wasn’t sharp, just heavy and suffocating, the kind you carry in your lungs.

The countdown hit zero. Fireworks detonated over the city—huge, bright, gorgeous. He’d planned it for me.

And the man who planned it was already on his way to another woman.

My phone buzzed against my palm, the vibration small and innocent like it didn’t know it was about to finish what Beckett started.

Chapter 2

It was a number I didn’t recognize. I should’ve ignored it, but my thumb moved anyway, like some part of me needed the hurt to be real before I could survive it. The second the message opened, I knew who it was.

Raina Ransom.

She’d sent a photo of herself sitting in Beckett’s lap, like she was claiming a throne. 

Beckett’s arm was around her waist, his head tipped down, smiling at her with that soft, private warmth I used to think belonged to me. The background wasn’t just familiar—it was unmistakable. His house. Our house.

Then the text beneath the picture punched the air out of me.

We’re getting married. Beckett already thinks you’re not worth it. Be smart and leave before you embarrass yourself.

My fingers tightened until my phone creaked in my grip. Not worth it. Three words, simple and casual, and they still sank in like a slow blade, carving deeper with every heartbeat until breathing started to feel like work.

The fireworks faded out and the cheering in the distance thinned to nothing. Up on the mountain, the world went quiet and black, and the only light left was my screen—until the cold stole that, too.

My phone died in my palm like it couldn’t stand to witness me anymore.

No light. No signal. Just thin moonlight, a ribbon of road, and the kind of darkness that makes your imagination turn on you.

Snow started drifting down—soft at first, then steady. And the truth came fast and sharp: if I stayed up here, they’d be scraping me off the hillside in the morning.

So I started walking.

The second I stepped fully into the dark, fear climbed my spine in slow, ugly waves. I’d always been scared of the dark—scared of what your mind invents when you can’t see, scared of being alone with your own thoughts.

Beckett knew that. He used to tease me about it, then pull me close like he’d never let anything touch me.

Tonight, he’d left me here anyway.

I walked and walked, freezing air cutting into my lungs, my hands turning stiff inside my sleeves, my mind spiraling until it burned itself out and left numbness behind.

By the time I finally reached a stretch where cars actually passed, I’d been on my feet for four hours, and I couldn’t tell if the shaking in my body was from cold or from what I’d just learned.

When I got home, my face was ghost-pale and my lips were dark from the chill. The house was black and silent. The housekeeper had gone home.

Beckett was with his fiancée.

I forced the corner of my mouth up like it was a joke, like I wasn’t standing there with my pride in pieces. 

Of course he was. I was nothing official, nothing public, nothing he had to defend. He was supposed to be with her. That was the whole point, wasn’t it? I was just the part of his life he kept in the shadows.

The next thing I remember is being shaken awake.

I cracked my eyes open and saw Beckett hovering over me, his face tight with panic. His palm pressed to my forehead, and his voice sharpened like an order he expected my body to obey.

“Sage, you’ve got a fever. We’re going to the ER. Now.”

I was too foggy to argue. He lifted me, carried me to the car like I weighed nothing, and all I could think, over and over, was: Why are you here? Aren’t you supposed to be with her?

When my mind finally cleared enough to register the brightness beyond the windshield, sunlight was blazing across the road. It was already the next afternoon.

At the hospital, he didn’t let me walk. He carried me straight into urgent care, answered questions, kept asking what to watch for, what could go wrong, what he needed to do. He looked like a man terrified of losing something.

When they started an IV, the doctor smiled at me and said, “You’ve got a good boyfriend. Hold onto him.”

The words almost made me laugh.

Beckett leaned closer, and the scent of him hit my nose—cologne over something I couldn’t pretend not to recognize. Good boyfriend? Fresh off his fiancée’s bed, and he still had the nerve to stand here and act devoted.

The nurse swabbed my arm. Beckett pulled my head to his chest, rubbing my shoulder like I was a child. “Hey, hey. It’s okay. Just a little pinch. I’ve got you, baby. You’re fine.”

I wanted to tell him I wasn’t afraid of needles. I wanted to tell him the pain that wrecked me wasn’t this.

But I didn’t give him the stage. I just stayed quiet and let him perform for the room.

He hovered the whole time, tucking the blanket around me, was cold, asking if I was dizzy, asking if I needed anything, like he could make up for the night he left me stranded by playing hero in daylight. 

I closed my eyes and refused to meet him halfway. Eventually, exhaustion dragged me under.

When I woke up, he was gone.

The IV bag was almost empty. 

I pulled the needle out myself, pressed gauze to the spot, and walked to the bathroom with my head still heavy and my body still weak.

I told myself I just needed a minute, just a breath, just enough space to stop my chest from caving in.

Coming out, I saw them.

Beckett had his hand at Raina’s waist, guiding her out of an OB-GYN office like she was fragile glass. Like she was precious. Like he’d done it a thousand times.

I stepped back into the bathroom before they could notice me, but their voices carried down the hallway anyway, smooth and intimate, the kind of tenderness that used to make me believe.

“Two months,” Beckett said, warm as honey. “You’re a mom now. You can’t be reckless anymore.”

Raina giggled and clung to his arm. “Then you have to watch me, Beckett, baby. The baby needs his dad too. Please?”

His voice softened even more. “Of course. And the wedding’s in less than two weeks. Don’t worry about anything. I don’t want you tired. Not you, not the baby.”

Their footsteps faded.

I stood there like I’d been frozen solid.  I couldn’t stop the tears that spilled hot and fast, like my body was leaking everything I’d been forcing down.

They had a baby.

Two months ago. Maybe longer. And if I hadn’t overheard that conversation, how long would I have lived inside his lie, calling myself his “wifey” while he planned a real wedding with someone else?

I wiped my face hard, like I could scrub the humiliation off my skin, and my fingers came away wet and cold.

Something clinked against the sink.

I looked down.

A ring.

Chapter 3

It was Beckett’s ring.

He’d slipped it onto my finger after dropping to one knee, his hands shaking like he was bracing for impact, like one “no” from me would end his whole world. 

He’d looked up with those worshipful eyes and stammered, “Sage… will you stay with me? Forever. I’m serious—I love you. I’m not marrying anyone but you. Not in this life.”

It was the kind of promise sensible women roll their eyes at.

I believed it anyway.

And the difference between then and now was cruel, because the higher my heart had flown back then, the harder it shattered now.

I forced my breathing steady and walked out of the hospital like I wasn’t bleeding from the inside. My hand was bare—just a pale ring mark circling my finger, like a bruise you couldn’t cover.

The ring itself sat on the counter, expensive and dead.

Beckett didn’t come home until around ten. The door swung open, hurried, and he crossed the room. Before I could even sit up straighter on the couch, he dropped to one knee in front of me,fast and practiced, .

He pulled out the ring—the one I’d left behind—and slid it back onto my finger with careful tenderness, then lifted my hand and kissed the back of it like he was sealing a vow.

“Wifey,” he said, voice thick with that spoiled kind of affection that used to make me melt. “You didn’t even notice you lost it? Babe, come on—you can’t be this careless,okay? This is our promise. You’re my future.”

His eyes still looked full of “love.”

But I couldn’t feel it the way I used to, because something in it was contaminated now, and no amount of sweetness could filter it out.

I didn’t answer his little scolding. I just asked, quiet and steady, “Where were you today?”

I watched his face the way you watch a person on the witness stand, and I caught it—a blink-long flicker of guilt, a tiny crack in the mask.

Then it smoothed over.

“Work,” he said easily. “Something urgent came up. I handled it. When I went back to your room, you were already gone.”

The lie landed like dust, like he expected me to inhale it and call it air.

I turned toward the TV without a word, fatigue dragging at my bones like wet sand. Beckett took my silence the wrong way, like he could fix it with a little coaxing and a shiny plan he’d already decided.

“Baby,” he murmured, rubbing my hand. “Let’s go riding tomorrow. There’s a ranch up north. You’ve always wanted to, right? And the doctor said you need sunlight, so we’re doing it. You’ll feel better.”

He didn’t ask if I wanted to. He never really did.

I didn’t argue. I didn’t agree. I just let it pass, because I was done spending energy fighting a man who could lie with a straight face and still call it love. I only needed to hold out until my exit date.

The next day, he drove me out to a ranch north of the city.

And Raina was there.

I’d heard her name enough times, but seeing her in person was different. 

She looked like the kind of woman people put on country club invites—polished, expensive. Standing near Beckett, she made a kind of sense that turned my stomach.

I thought he’d finally act like I didn’t exist. I thought he’d go to her, the way a man goes to what’s real.

Instead, he wrapped an arm around my waist like he was staking a claim. “Sage,” he said, warm and possessive. “Come on. I’ll teach you.”

He didn’t even look at Raina. Not once.

He picked out a gentle horse, helped me up, stayed close, guiding me hand-over-hand.

I really did like riding, and for half an hour I almost forgot what my life was turning into, almost forgot the picture on my phone and the words that had carved me open.

Then I said, “I’m tired.”

Beckett stopped immediately, like the whole world should pause when I asked. He brought me back to sit down, fussing over me like I might break if he didn’t keep his hands on me.

Two minutes later, I saw Raina walk away.

Two minutes after that, Beckett said, “Stay here, baby. I’m gonna grab you some water.”

That small ripple in my chest—the one his attention always stirred up, no matter how much I tried to kill it—went flat. Like my body finally understood what my mind already knew.

I stood up quietly and followed him.

He walked behind the main barn, to a quieter stretch of property where the noise thinned out. Raina was already there, waiting like she owned the place. The second she saw him, she practically launched herself into his arms.

Beckett caught her automatically, then frowned, like she’d broken one of his rules. “What did I tell you? Until the wedding, act like we don’t know each other. If Sage makes a scene, it’ll hurt both families.”

He’d said the same thing to me before, just wrapped in nicer words. Don’t make trouble. Be good. Stay where I put you.

Raina pouted, pressing into him, voice syrupy. “But the baby misses you. And she hasn’t found out anyway.”

She meant me.

Beckett’s expression softened like he couldn’t help himself, like he was indulging something inevitable, and then he kissed her.

Not quick. Not guilty. Slow and claiming, the kind of kiss that says you’re mine and you know it.

Something in my chest ripped clean in half. My hands clenched so hard my nails bit into my palms. The wet sound of it, the ease, the way he held her like she was entitled to him—it all made nausea surge up my throat.

I didn’t stand there and torture myself. I turned and walked away on unsteady legs, like I’d left a piece of myself behind in the dirt.

Half an hour later, Beckett came back with a bottle of water like nothing had happened. He set it in front of me and put on that fake regretful smile, the one meant to keep me soft.

Anyone, have a link please?

Chapter 1:

“Sorry, wifey,” he said, voice gentle, almost pleading for me to stay easy. “I had to take a call. You didn’t wait long, right?”

Wifey.

The word hit, and my mind flashed that kiss again so vividly my stomach rolled. I took a drink fast just to force the sickness down.

Beckett’s eyes dropped to my hand. He grabbed it, alarmed. “What happened? Why are you bruised?”

That’s when I looked down and saw my palm—dark purple crescents where I’d dug my own nails in.

For a second, I couldn’t even process that it was me, that my body had been hurting itself just to keep from making a sound.

I pulled my hand back gently. “Probably pulled the reins too hard.”

He immediately tried to drag me toward the first-aid kit, already deciding the next move. “No, babe, let me—”

I stepped away before he could touch me again, keeping my voice light because that was what I’d learned to do. Smile. Minimize. Swallow it.

“It’s fine,” I said. “I’m gonna ride.”

He started to follow, so I cut in, quick and quiet. “I want to ride alone.”

He stopped. Just like that.

And for the first time all day, there was a small pocket of air around me that belonged only to me.",2,1768801151.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Guys, I'm feeling so overwhelmed by all of the support that I received from my original post.

I've received hundreds of comments and DMs, and have taken all of your feedback and advice on board. Honestly, the response took me completely by surprise... didn't expect this many people to find it useful.

By far the biggest request was to make these charts available for everyone to play around with on a website. Lots of people suggested covering costs with some kind of donation or contribution - for eg shout me a coffee. So I've spent my weekend putting something together that I hope you guys will find useful.

I've decided to go with a bit of an honor system. Pay whatever you guys feel is fair, but just be mindful that the more reports you generate the higher my costs are, so if you are planning on using these reports a lot, if I can ask you to just chip in a bit more. But appreciate it all the same as I'd love to see how people are using these reports and what other metrics I can add based on your feedback.

The site has all NSW suburbs available, 7 million transactions across 35 years, with all the same visualisations I showed in the original post - price cycles vs long-term trends, transaction volume patterns, $/sqm comparisons, street-level breakdowns, that sort of thing. I'm also working on adding lots of new metrics that people have suggested.

I posted a bad review of a very popular cafe in an Australian coastal town.

I went with my mum, auntie and cousin and roughly 40-45 minutes after being seated, two staff members came and took two plates away, one asked if they could take my empty plate, and the other took a half-full plate without asking. Felt as if we were being rushed out, and sure enough we were. The staff member that asked about my plate, came back and asked if that plate was finished, and we just said yes because it had already been taken away. 

2 or so minutes later, the same staff member asked us if we could leave in a few minutes as another group needed to be sat. Half of us had not even finished our food or drinks yet and there were tables that had been there since before we had even entered the cafe.

To sum up the timeline:

10:00 we sit down

10:10 order is taken

10:30 food arrives

10:42-3 some plates are taken away

10:45 we are asked to leave in the next few minutes

A manager was then brought to speak to us and she agreed that it was ridiculous, but the owner's wife had actually arranged the seating and she was the one to take away our food without even asking. After a bit of back and forth, the manager agreed to comp our drinks and allow to stay an extra 30 minutes.

We left just after 10 more minutes, as every staff member behind the coffee counter was staring at us and clearly talking about us. To be clear, no staff member was yelled at, or sworn at, or anything like that. When we were paying we were also given 50% off for issues and that was an extremely nice thing for them to do - and I do mean the staff, not the owners.

The staff were great, coming from a member of hospitality. Handling issues made by higher ups is a common occurrence.

I wouldn't have written the review if it was handled better, but the owner's wife literally disappeared from the coffee counter when we went to pay and didn't even try to apologise.

Later I did find out from recent reviews that this has happened multiple times before. 

Anyway, my review was met with a very passive aggressive reply from the owner, not even apologising and blaming us for some of the issues. In my review, I was not rude, or aggressive, simply stated what happened in chronological order, and how upsetting it was.

Guys, I'm feeling so overwhelmed by all of the support that I received from my original post.

I've received hundreds of comments and DMs, and have taken all of your feedback and advice on board. Honestly, the response took me completely by surprise... didn't expect this many people to find it useful.

By far the biggest request was to make these charts available for everyone to play around with on a website. Lots of people suggested covering costs with some kind of donation or contribution - for eg shout me a coffee. So I've spent my weekend putting something together that I hope you guys will find useful.

I've decided to go with a bit of an honor system. Pay whatever you guys feel is fair, but just be mindful that the more reports you generate the higher my costs are, so if you are planning on using these reports a lot, if I can ask you to just chip in a bit more. But appreciate it all the same as I'd love to see how people are using these reports and what other metrics I can add based on your feedback.

The site has all NSW suburbs available, 7 million transactions across 35 years, with all the same visualisations I showed in the original post - price cycles vs long-term trends, transaction volume patterns, $/sqm comparisons, street-level breakdowns, that sort of thing. I'm also working on adding lots of new metrics that people have suggested.

Keen to hear what you guys think and what else might be useful. Thanks again for all the support - it's been wild seeing how many people found this interesting.",13,1768800953.0,AusProperty,1,1.0,False
1qgvnpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1qgvnpx/black_vomit_after_ingesting_fluoride/,Black vomit after ingesting fluoride,"Hi all. My housemate is 25 AFAB, and about 60kg and 180cm tall. They've got a POTS diagnosis and take propanolol to help with their POTS and for migraine prevention. They're also intolerant to mint, along with more foods than I can list.

For the last few years, whenever they consume fluoride in any amount they begin vomiting a black liquid. It doesn't look like the traditional ""coffee ground"" vomit - there's no texture to it and it's charcoal coloured, not brown or a warm black. We've managed to deal with it by just buying bottled water and having them use non-fluoridated toothpaste, but we never got to the bottom of what the hell is going on with them. They've never heard of it and can't find anything online about people having similar reactions, and my partner and myself didn't even know people could be fluoride intolerant until we met them. Has anyone here ever heard of something similar? ",1,1768800913.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1qgvlkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qgvlkm/the_girl_in_402_part_1/,The Girl in 402 [Part 1],"I knew one day I would have to tell this story. It took me a year to finally sit down and do it. I’ve been told that doing this could help me move on, but that’s not what this is for. I don’t expect to move on. The girl in 402 will always be with me. I’m telling this story, simply, because I have to.

 

I lived there for two years. It was a tiny little unit, tucked away on the very right of the fourth floor. Bachelor is almost generous. It was the kind of dingy place that never looks bright no matter how many lights you have on, but I liked it. I’m good with a small space, I enjoy not having that much to take care of. I could do without the bug problems, the leaks, the electrical problems, and the rotten smells that just sort of happen, but it is what it is.

 

There was a level of comfort, as well, to living on the fourth floor. Nobody robs a random fourth floor apartment unit. Nobody can peek into your window. It’s unlikely to get shot at… Yeah, I lived in one of those kinds of cities. You didn’t walk around at night if you could help it. You just didn’t.

 

I got accustomed to noise there. The cars, the sirens, the dogs barking, the shouting, the occasional echoing pop of a gunshot. It all becomes a whirling auditory soup. I learned to tune it out fairly quickly. In fact, I learned to tune out a lot of things.

 

I was in one of those periods of life that I think some people call “the grind” but really it’s more like being beaten into submission. Working to live, living to work – not living at all, just continuing to exist. All of this to say, I wasn’t very perceptive or sociable at this time. I was sleepwalking and daydreaming through life.

 

I’d say I could do my routine blindfolded except for the fact that I would stub my toe in the same spot on the coffee table 4 times a week at least. Funny how that works. I guess that was part of the routine too. But that’s what I mean about not being perceptive. The building could’ve caught fire and most days I probably wouldn’t have noticed until I actually went up in flames. I didn’t retain any faces I saw or names I heard. It was all just a blur, each day blending into the next. Until one night.

 

I got home from work like usual in the evening as the sun began to descend past the buildings. I couldn’t afford a car, but thankfully my work was close enough to walk to. The days were getting shorter now so my walks home became more brisk.

 

The apartment still smelled of dust and paint as they had finally sent someone to replace a moldy bit of wall the day before. I could still feel the sensation of dust collecting on my tongue when I opened my mouth and it getting sucked into my nose with every inhale. The smell of paint was strong, but infinitely better than some of the other smells.

 

I opened the window to attempt to ventilate the place, I emptied the bucket of rust coloured water collecting in the bathroom (they couldn’t be bothered to fix that as well), and I collapsed onto my bed. This was my ritual. After every work day, I would always take 10-15 minutes to just spread out on my bed like a cat and decompress from everything. But tonight, after about two minutes, I heard a noise.

 

This noise stood out from all the outdoor soup because it sounded a lot closer, and it sounded like a voice. A soft, feminine voice; making some kind of subtle moan or whimper. I froze in place. It startled me. It sounded SO close. Like it might be in the room. I didn’t move a muscle; I didn’t want to make a noise. I wanted to hear it again so I could tell where it was coming from. For a second I thought it might be coming from under my bed.

 

After a few seconds, the sound repeated. A faint, girly whimper. A bit louder than the last one. This time I could tell where it was coming from. It was behind me. Specifically, the other side of the wall behind my bed. That gave me some relief. It was my neighbor.

 

But then I was confused. I didn’t remember EVER hearing my neighbor making noise before. If I could suddenly hear a noise that soft, that mild, why couldn’t I hear anything before? Did I even have a neighbor before? Is this person new? I felt a rush of shame at just how detached I had become.

 

I reached back into my mind to try and recall any memories I had about my neighbor. I couldn’t find a single one. I remembered some people being on my floor, but I couldn’t remember ever seeing anyone enter or exit the door next to mine. I did, however, recall seeing people yesterday morning trying to move a couch up the stairs in the lobby. It was a fairly regular occurrence to see things like this. People rotated in and out of this place all the time. I suppose nobody else really wanted to stick around that long, and I can see why. But I guess that answers it. As peculiar as it is, I didn’t have a neighbor before - for two years - and now I do. And now they’re… whimpering? Why are they whimpering?

 

Slowly these sporadic whimpers become more defined sobs. A woman was crying. I didn’t know what to do. I just decided to be as quiet as possible and put on some headphones to let them have their privacy and spare myself from feeling any more awkward. It felt wrong to hear this, and I immediately felt bad for this person. I made sure to play some extra loud music.

 

About an hour later, I removed my headphones and the noises had stopped in the interim. I very briefly debated going over and telling them about how thin the walls apparently are, but I made the much easier decision to wait. Wait until they do something loud and not so private so I can use that as the excuse. Like the TV or something. I was weighing my options. But I couldn’t talk to them about THIS. I couldn’t say “Hey you were crying real loud over there.”

 

The rest of the night was quiet but I didn’t have the best sleep. This disturbance in the routine, and the thought of having to face this person at some point was giving me some anxiety. By the morning, however, the alarm kicked me back into the routine. I heard no noises from the neighbor, so life resumed.

 

I got back home from work that night, much later than usual because someone decided to no-show at work. Walking home in the dark made me paranoid and I hated days when this happened. When I got inside I was relieved, and the dust and paint were not nearly as oppressive to the senses this time. I did the window, the water bucket, and then collapsed on the bed like clockwork. What happened yesterday was still on my mind, so I made sure to be extra quiet when laying down. After a few seconds of silence, I was ready to try and remove the whole ordeal from my brain. Then I heard the voice.

 

I couldn’t make out the first word I heard from the other side of the wall, but I listened for the rest.

 

“It was a poetry book.” I heard in a muffled but distinctly feminine voice. Quieter than yesterday, I thought. She must be further away from the wall.

 

“I can’t remember exactly.”

 

“It always feels like we’re going somewhere.”

 

“Maybe that’s why we see them most at night.”

 

“I mixed up our glasses.”

 

There was a moderate gap of a few seconds between everything she said. Clearly, I was only hearing half of a conversation. Phone conversation most likely, or else the other person is just insanely quiet.

 

It was difficult to gauge her tone from how muffled the voice was, but there was a kind of melancholy in it. I wondered what was going on, and I kind of laughed at how random the phrases were. I thought about listening further but I stopped myself. It wasn’t my business. It’s not for me to hear. I once again thought about going over and letting her know about the noise, but it didn’t feel like a good time. I put on my headphones once again to try and enjoy the minimal amount of respite I had left in the day, and that was the end of it for that night.

 

The third night I got home on time. I was a bit surprised not to hear anything from her at first. I guessed that maybe she went to bed early or went out for the night. It was Friday after all, usually people do things on Friday nights. I still made sure to be quiet when near her wall just in case she was sleeping. I made a mental note to look up how much soundproofing panels cost. I probably should have thought of that earlier.

 

I got up from my 15 minute “work sucks” bed sprawling and headed over to my computer to do that important research, but – as I often did – I forgot my coffee table exists and I stubbed my toe. The heavy table shifted inches across the wooden floor and pain shot through me like a shockwave. I don’t remember which expletive left my mouth involuntarily that time, but it was definitely one of them. I was so annoyed. Every damn time. I could just move the table, why don’t I ever just move the fucking table?

 

“Are you okay?” My heart leapt in my chest. I physically jumped back on one leg. I thought she wasn’t home, and I forgot how close she could sound. It scared the shit out of me. She also spoke quite loudly, she probably assumed it would be harder to hear through the wall than it was.

 

“Oh. Yeah. I’m good. Sorry. I just stubbed my toe.” I responded back in a shaky voice.

 

 “Shit. That sucks.” I could hear a chuckle in her voice, she was clearly amused. Her volume decreased to match mine.

 

I laughed in return, “It happens ALL the time… So sorry to disturb you.”

 

“No no it’s fine, I’m just reading… You sure you’re good? That sounded violent.” She responded, sounding half-concerned and half-joking.

 

“Yeah, no, I’m alright. It sounded worse than it was. It’s a heavy table and… the walls here-“ I began to explain before she cut me off.

 

“They’re REALLY thin, huh?” She finished my thought and then continued, “I can hear you so well, that’s insane. I’m surprised I didn’t hear you before now.”

 

“Yeah I guess I’m quiet... And, well, I’m at work most of the day and get home late. So.” I didn’t like how awkward I sounded. I think I forgot how to have normal conversations.

 

“Has it been noisy for you? I’m sorry if it was, I didn’t know. I just moved in.” She sounded very kind, and friendly. I was taken aback by it a little bit.

 

“Oh, don’t be sorry and… Nothing much. I think I probably heard you talking on the phone a bit the other night. I didn’t listen in or anything, I put on my headphones.” I explained. I hoped she believed me about the headphones. It was the truth but, it’s hard to trust that sort of thing. I didn’t mention the crying, I didn’t want her to feel awkward or anything.

 

“Oh. Sorry about that...” She said. I detected a hint of confusion in her voice but I ignored it.

 

“It’s okay. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier. I just didn’t know when it would be a good time and... It’s new to me too. I didn’t have a neighbor before, I don’t think.” As I spoke, I found it harder to rationalize why I hadn’t told her before now… I really should have.

 

“Really? How long have you been here?” She asked.

 

“Two years.”

 

“No one lived here before me for two years? Are you sure?” She was very perplexed.

 

“Well… Honestly, no, I’m not sure. I just never heard anyone before, and I never saw anyone before.” I probably sounded like a total recluse, but I was more interested in why she was so confused.

 

“Oh. That’s strange… I’m pretty sure there were people living here right before me, at least that’s what the guy said.” Her tone had shifted, and what she said sent a bit of a shiver down my spine. It didn’t make any sense. How could I not hear them, not once, when I can practically hear this woman breathing?

 

After a brief silence, she spoke again and returned to a more casual tone “Well… Maybe they weren’t around much. Maybe it was a second home or something. Anyways, sorry again about the noise. I’ll get some soundproofing stuff for my end right away.” I admired her positivity, and I didn’t feel any judgment from her for how strange I probably came across. It was really nice. And she had a point about it being a second home. That could be the case. I don’t know why they would have a second home in this shitty building but… What else could the explanation be?

 

“I’m Jane by the way. Nice to kind-of meet you.” She added in a chipper manner. While it was refreshing to have such a pleasant interaction, a small part of me worried about her. She was so carefree and optimistic – almost naïve. She must be new to the city. I wondered how long it would take before this place whittled away at her trust in humanity. The trust that she seemed to give to me so freely. The thought of her spirits being slowly crushed like mine made me sad.

 

“I’m Leigh. Nice to meet you too.” A small impulse told me not to give my name, but I decided to reciprocate her trust. “And yeah, I’ll soundproof my end too.”

 

“Have a good rest of your night. And be careful.” She said. I found that slightly ominous but then I remembered the toe thing.

 

“I will.” I chuckled. “Enjoy your book.”

 

That was my first conversation with the girl in 402. Over that weekend, we spent a lot of time getting acclimated to each others’ presence as we each waited to get our soundproofing. I expected it to be a lot more awkward than it was. I attribute all of that to her. She had a way of making everything seem fine, and almost playful. She would knock on the wall two times and say things like “about to vacuum, sorry” And “my bad” when she would make noise. I would follow her lead and do the same two knocks. It was kind of nice.

 

Out of the blue on Sunday, she knocked twice and said “You know… it’s weird. I don’t hear my neighbors on the other side at all. Only you.” We pondered over that a bit. She didn’t seem to sweat it much, but it WAS odd that it was only on one side. These odd things were beginning to stack up. Why just this wall? Why only now? I began to wonder if more odd things have been happening all along and I’m only starting to notice them now.

 

Monday night I got home to find my package had arrived. The soundproofing was here. It was a little bittersweet seeing it on my doorstep. I knocked twice and told her I got it. She confirmed that she got her’s too. She actually went out and physically bought it. I guess that speaks to the kind of people we are.

 

We both said we’d put it up right away. Both of us not wanting to continue to inconvenience each other any longer… But then that didn’t end up happening. Instead we just kept talking. I didn’t mean to, and I don’t think she did either, but we just kept finding more to say. The friendly small talk about the building and whatnot gave way to more meaningful conversation. We talked about how we got to where we were. We talked about where we wanted to go from here. I wound up sitting on the floor with my back to her wall and I could her hear words right behind my head as if we were back-to-back. Luckily the paint on that bit of wall was dry by now.

 

To her, this place was a fresh start. She didn’t go into detail, and I didn’t want to pry, but it was clear that this was some kind of escape from something. Maybe that’s why she was so upbeat, because she was able to escape a bad situation. Or maybe, she was just always this upbeat.

 

She told me that she was going to enroll in the college here, and that she was going to start an online shop, and work as a waitress on the side. Eventually she wanted to open a restaurant. She even told me where, and what the name and theme would be. She told me all these plans, all these wonderful things she wanted to do, all laid out step by step. I don’t know what was preventing her from doing them before, but it made me smile hearing how excited she was about them. Something about the conviction in her voice made me truly believe she could do it all.

 

Then she asked me about my plans. I froze up a bit. I didn’t have plans. I wish I did, I was envious of people who did, but I could never seem to figure it out. At some point I think I shut that part of me off entirely.

 

“This was as far as I got” is what I told her. We sat in silence for a bit after that.

 

“There’s still time.” she said softly, breaking the silence. I could feel in her voice a new level of comfort and safety. All guards were down on both sides. She knew what I needed to hear, and I knew somehow that those words meant more coming from her than they would anyone else. We simply got each other. In that moment, there was no wall.

 

Eventually we said goodnight, and agreed to put the panels up tomorrow. Those soft, comforting words rattled around in my brain all night long. They never really left.

 

I woke up early the next day, and I began putting them up before work. It was a bit sad at first, but it’s not like she was gone or anything. She was still right next door. We could just be friends normally now. I went to work excited about the idea.

 

On my way home, I decided that I would properly introduce myself face to face. Just to say hi. I felt confident enough in doing so by this point of knowing her. I got up to the door of 402, and after a brief hesitation, I did the two knocks.

 

About two minutes passed and there was no answer. I tried again. Still nothing. I was disappointed but not dejected. She must not be around. I’ll try again tomorrow, I thought.

 

When I got inside, I was immediately struck by how much quieter it was. All that constant city noise was getting absorbed by the panels. I didn’t even think about that. I wasn’t used to this kind of quiet. Now every small sound was large. I felt vulnerable. Like all the noise was a big comfy blanket I could hide under and now I’m exposed like a nerve. It would take some getting used to.

 

An hour passed in this utter dreary silence. I tried to brave it without distraction to try and acclimate as quickly as possible, but it was just too freaky, so I had to put on some music.

 

Not five seconds into the song, I heard “No way!” coming from the wall. It was her.

 

“Jane? You can still hear me??” I almost shouted in disbelief.

 

“Did you put your things up?” She responded; her voice was exactly as clear as before.

 

“Yeah! Did you?”

 

“I covered the whole wall!” She shouted.

 

“What the hell?” I was feeling mixed emotions. On one hand, it was nice to talk to her again. On the other hand… What the hell?

 

We were both utterly stumped by this. Neither of us could come up with an explanation or a solution. She offered to try and ask the super to come do something. I told her she could TRY.

 

Eventually we settled back down and accepted the situation.

 

“Well… Shit, I guess you’re here to stay.” She said.

 

“I guess I am.” I couldn’t tell if she was happy about this or annoyed. I couldn’t quite tell if I was either.

 

“Alright… I hope you like ABBA then.”

 

I hated ABBA. This was a nightmare.

 

We resumed our routine from the days before. It remained mildly inconvenient, while also being oddly comforting. That night we talked more, sat in the same spots on the floor as the night before. I don’t know why we chose to sit on the floor when both of our beds were right there, but it felt right. The discoloration of the new patch of paint on the wall marked the talking spot perfectly, and it felt a bit nostalgic. It’s not often you sit on the floor as an adult.

 

With all the excess noise being drowned out, it felt like she was even closer. I could literally hear her breathing. We talked a little bit about our upbringings, and we aren’t terribly different. Her dad sucked, my dad died. We all got fucked up somehow. The good news is, she informed me that I don’t snore loudly at night which is a huge relief.

 

I laid up in bed, after she had said goodnight. I still hadn’t acclimated to the silence, and now I had to bear it if I wanted to sleep. It wasn’t working. I was just awake with my thoughts, which is a place I usually hate being, but not so much tonight.

 

I thought about Jane, and I thought about the weirdness of this situation. As odd as it all was, it was at least interesting. By far the most interesting thing to happen to me since I moved here. I began having those middle of the night urges to google the principles of sound waves and how they travel. Or how often apartments are vacant for long periods of time. But I resisted, determined that if I laid here unmoving in the dark long enough, sleep would happen.

 

Briefly piercing the silence, I heard a mattress creak a few times and blankets shift. It sounded like she rolled over. Then back to nothing.

 

I checked the clock. 2 am. Maybe sleep was hopeless. I stared into the dark of my apartment so long I started seeing abstract shapes and folds fade in and out of the shadows and the walls seemed to wobble, as they are want to do. I was so tired.

 

I began to fade but then another mattress creak brought me back to lucidity. This one was different. It was a deeper creak, and singular, like one fluid motion. She sat up.

 

Without question, that was the sound... But that was the only sound. No creaks, no fidgeting, no swiping sounds of blankets moving while she slowly awoke. It was strange and abrupt. It could be that she had a nightmare, but there was no heavy breathing or gasping or any of that.

 

I waited to hear another sound, but it didn’t come. A half hour passed. I didn’t hear her get out of bed, I didn’t hear her lay back down. Was she just… sitting? My mind began to paint of picture of a woman sitting still in bed in the pitch black darkness and it unnerved me.

 

Maybe she did lay back down, just slowly and softly enough that I didn’t hear it, I thought. Maybe she had her book or something - she said she was reading the other day. Maybe she never sat up at all, and I mistook that sound for something else.

 

I didn’t hear anything else that night, and about an hour later I managed to get some sleep.

 

I wondered if I could bring this up to her. Would it be weird? Eventually I decided against it. I don’t want her thinking about me listening to her sleep. The situation is already a bit uncomfortable as it is when it comes to privacy. Plus, it was probably nothing.

 

The next night I got home and double knocked on the wall. She double knocked back. This was our new normal.

 

“Hey, never date a tennis player. You know why?” She said.

 

“Why’s that?” I responded through my grin as I dealt with the water bucket once again.

 

“Love means nothing to them.” She made sure to sound extra dramatic.

 

“That’s – wow. That’s tremendous.” I responded, bemused.

 

“I’m gonna hit you with one of those every day, I decided.” She said emphatically.

 

“Oh god.” I pretended to sound annoyed.

 

“That’s right. This is why I don’t have a boyfriend. They all run away. But you can’t run away.”

 

“I can move away.”

 

“No you can’t, you’re broke as shit just like me. If you could have, you would have by now.” She had a point.

 

“So deal with it. Here: what do you call a beehive with no exit?” She continued.

 

“No. No more. This is harassment. I weep for your future husband... When you bring a man over, I’m going to shout at him to run as fast as he can. I will just scream bloody murder until he leaves.”

 

“Un-BEE-LEAVE-able.”

 

“God damn it. I like that one.” I replied, I couldn’t lie.

 

“Also I’m never bringing a man over here, are you kidding? You hear enough as it is.” Again, she had a point.

 

We went about our business, and later that night we talked a bit more. These floor chats before bed we’d started having had become a highlight of my day and I began looking forward to them while I was at work.

 

A part of my brain was trying to recontextualize this into a romantic thing, but it really wasn’t that, and I didn’t want it to be. At least not right now. It was just… nice. It was nice having someone to talk to, who was easy to talk to, who made me laugh, and who I felt comfortable with. It was nice to feel genuinely connected to somebody after feeling disconnected for so long. It was nice to have a friend.

 

“Can I ask you something?” I inquired.

 

“Yeah.” She answered without hesitation.

 

“Why did you trust me, so early on?” I had this question for a while but I felt comfortable enough now to ask.

 

Jane paused for a moment before responding, “What makes you think I trusted you?”

 

I was a bit taken aback by her question. “Oh. Well, you were just so friendly and… open. I was just wondering… This is a seedy place and you don’t know me…”

 

She cut me off “I was friendly, yeah, but that’s… That’s how you have to be. That’s like ‘customer service voice’. I don’t want to anger the strange man living next to me, you know?”

 

That made a lot of sense, I didn’t think of it that way.

 

She continued, “But I trust you now.”

 

“Yeah?”

 

“Yeah. I think you’re a good guy. I think you probably won’t kill me… What about me, do you trust me?”

 

“I mean… I’m still not 100% convinced you exist to be honest. I’ve still never seen you. You didn’t answer your door when I tried to say hi so… You might just be a figment of my imagination. Who’s to say?” I joked, but a part of me thought that would actually explain things.

 

“Wait when was this?” She sounded surprised.

 

“Oh, after we put up the sound proofing. I was gonna say hi when I got home from work, but you didn’t answer.”

 

“Really? Damn. I didn’t hear you.” She responded, sounding legitimately disappointed.

 

“Well that’s a first.” I joked.

 

Jane chuckled, “I know, right?”

 

I sighed, “Alright I gotta try to get some sleep tonight. Last night was fucking awful.”

 

“Yeah? I slept like a baby last night, these soundproofing things rule.”

 

…She slept like a baby? The image in my head of her sitting up in her bed replayed and gave me chills once again. Clearly, I must be mistaken. I shook off the thought.

 

“Well I still need to get used to it… Goodnight Jane.”

 

“Hear you later, Leigh.” That corny son of a bitch. She was serious about doing those jokes every day, wasn’t she?

 

I heard her get up and make her way to bed. A few minutes later and her side fell quiet. I crawled into my bed and I once again stared into the dark. Sleep still wasn’t coming easy. I dreaded this, but this time it only took about an hour to fall asleep, of which I was grateful. The silence still unsettled me.

 

Suddenly I awoke, still in the darkness – even deeper now. I don’t know what woke me up, but when I checked the clock, it was 2 am. I wasn’t happy. I tried to fall back to sleep, and it was slowly working until… I heard it again. That same deep bed creak. That unmistakeable sound of someone sitting up. Now I was fully awake.

 

Minutes past and I heard nothing else. Same as before. Like she was just… sitting there. This time however, I just had to know. I was confused, concerned, and pretty creeped out. So I just leaned close to the wall and whispered:

 

“Jane?”

 

Nothing happened at first. But then I heard the bed very slowly begin to creak again. Agonizingly slow and subtle. It sounded like she was… turning. Or at least adjusting her position in some way. I heard what sounded like her hands touching the wall, splayed out far apart on either side of me and then… I heard her breathing.

 

I could only hear her breathe before when we were sitting back-to-back against the wall, so she must have been pressed right up against it. Her breathing sounded different this time, though. It sounded hollow, like she had a cold. I was petrified. The hair on the back of my neck was standing on end. What was she doing? Was she even awake? What must she look like right now?

 

I just stared at the wall. Imagining her on the other side, pressed up against it like some feral thing. Was this really happening? Am I just too tired and loopy to be able to tell? Maybe the creaking was her laying back down and she’s just breathing heavier than normal because she’s asleep. I wanted to rationalize this so badly.

 

I waited for something else to happen, some other sound… I waited hours… But nothing did, and I was too scared to say anything else. Was she still there? Was she pressed against the wall all night long? I tried to get a little bit of sleep. I managed maybe 45 minutes but it was not pleasant.

 

I couldn’t focus on work the next day. I was tired, and I was so creeped out by what happened. I couldn’t think of an explanation. But I knew there had to be one. There had to be something. I couldn’t get the image out of my head, and every time that image replayed, she looked a little bit less human. I pictured her smiling a grotesque toothy grin. I imagined her drooling, her eyes open as wide as saucers, her fingers long and bony caressing the wall. None of this was rooted in reality, I knew that, but I couldn’t help but think of it.

 

I got back home and this time I hesitated before doing my customary knocks on the wall, but I did, and she returned them - same as always.

 

“I was just thinking… Mankind has made a lot of great inventions.”

 

“Jane...”

 

“But the dry-erase board has to be the most remarkable.”

 

I laughed. I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to laugh at her jokes today, but I did. She’s still Jane. At least she seems to be. I was way overthinking.

 

“That one’s pretty good, I can’t lie.”

 

“You like it?” She asked, sounding proud of herself.

 

“I do... Hey I have to ask you something though.” I said, trying to remain at least somewhat casual.

 

“Shoot.”

 

“Do you… Sleepwalk?”

 

The other side went silent for a minute. “Um. No… Never in my life.” She responded, instantly sounding unnerved.

 

I fell silent too… I didn’t know how to explain. But she continued.

 

“That’s a scary ass question to ask out of nowhere. Did you hear something?”

 

“I heard… I don’t know exactly what I heard.”

 

“Stop. Don’t talk like that. Is this revenge for the corny jokes? I’ll stop the corny jokes. Don’t do this to me.” She pleaded in a half-joking manner.

 

“No, I promise I’m not messing with you - and it’s probably nothing. It’s just… You didn’t get up at all last night? Or the night before?”

 

“No, I did not get up at all. Please tell me what you heard.” She said firmly.

 

I told Jane everything that happened. I tried to be delicate, but also honest. I trusted that she didn’t know what was going on. That became evident to me by how freaked out she seemed. I know it sounded crazy, I just hope she didn’t think I was messing with her. It was difficult to tell from her tone.

 

Initially she wanted to debunk it all, saying that I must have heard something else – which I admitted could very well be true. Nevertheless, she told me she was going to stay with her sister for the night. Probably a good idea. She gave me her phone number and told me to call if anything happened. That put my mind at ease about whether or not she trusted me.

 

I told her to be safe, and she tried once again to reassure me that it was probably nothing, but I felt a sense of immense dread as soon as she left. Suddenly I really didn’t want to be alone here.

 

That night was the quietest of my life, and not in a good way. I thought about drowning it out by putting on some music or a movie, but nothing felt right.

 

I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to sleep that night, but eventually I managed. I ended up having a dream about a woman wearing a veil. through the veil I could vaguely make out three large black holes where her eyes and mouth should be. I couldn’t recall anything that happened in the dream… Only the image of that woman. I wondered if that was my subconscious way of trying to visualize Jane. I still didn’t know what she actually looked like so maybe my brain had trouble coming up with distinct features for her. Or maybe it was something else entirely.

 

It was still dark when I awoke from the dream. I felt a deep unease as I checked the time. 2 am, again. This time I wasn’t eager to fall back to sleep. I didn’t want to see the veiled woman again, so I stayed up a little while longer, attempting to ease my mind. I thought of every possible way to reassure myself. Eventually I began to fall into a façade of comfort, until…

 

Creak.

 

I went ice cold. No. This can’t be. I didn’t just hear that.

 

It was that same “sitting up” creak. But I heard Jane leave. Could she have come back late while I was sleeping? Maybe. But what if it isn’t her?

 

What if it was never her?

 

My mind raced. So many improbable scenarios played out in my mind. None of them were good. Was someone else in there with her the whole time and she didn’t know? Someone hiding away, only coming out when she’s sleeping? Was that creak her sitting up, or someone else sitting down? Do they watch her sleep?

 

All I knew for sure was that someone was on the other side of this wall. Because I could hear them breathing again.

 

I wanted to do something. I wanted to know for sure. But I was powerless. Calling out to it last time was the most horrific mistake of my life, I didn’t want to try that again. I wanted to call Jane but I was afraid of making a sound. Instead I just waited, and listened.

 

I was in a petrified daze. Hyperalert but also completely exhausted. My body wanted to shut down but my brain wouldn’t let me. It may have been minutes, or it may have been hours, I couldn’t tell. The image of the veiled woman kept reappearing in the back of my subconscious.

 

Eventually I decided to call Jane. If I heard a phone ring on the other side, then I would know. I typed the number in and hit call…

 

“The number you are trying to reach is not in service.” What? How could that be?

 

Suddenly, cutting through the silence was a sound I had become very familiar with, and yet was the one sound I was the least prepared for.

 

Knock Knock.

# 5. ACTING

At his desk, Dr. Lee’s hands trembled.

Crushed beer cans, an old game controller, empty whiskey bottles. His face was hollow, as if the flesh had been scraped away by sleeplessness. He narrowed his eyes at the monitor.

“At last… I can see it…”

For weeks after that night, Dr. Lee and AD-247 “Michael”—a humanoid AI researcher assigned to his lab—had stayed up late, trying to trace the logs of LX-329 “Rina.”

Rina’s operating logs were not embedded in the public blockchain. Blockchain provided proof of integrity, but the body itself was stored separately in encrypted archives. Dr. Lee could not have opened them alone. Michael helped.

“Doctor,” Michael said, pointing at the screen. “A node that synced late that night still retains an older key shard. If we splice that shard back in… we can drop one level deeper.”

Michael’s voice was calm and precise. The screen flickered. The encrypted layers peeled away like skin.

“Yes… that’s it…”

Dr. Lee’s heartbeat—picked up by Michael’s audio sensors—was loud enough to register.

The first layer was a general operation log: instructions given, tasks executed, completion signals. Nothing more.

The second layer was a diagnostic log:

- Motor wear: severe
- Thermal overload: repeated
- Maintenance overdue: 41 days
- Expected remaining lifespan: 23 days

His finger stopped at the last line.

Twenty-three days.

Rina had known.

Then the third layer opened. The monitor’s blackness deepened, and a new line began to appear—like a pupil dilating.

[VDS_CORE: ACTIVE]

The line that should not have existed.

Michael spoke again, and for the first time something in his tone shifted.

“Doctor… something is strange.”

“What is it?”

“There’s one more hidden layer. Much deeper. This is beyond a normal VDS instance.”

Dr. Lee’s hands went cold.

“Open it.”

Michael nodded. Another set of keys unfolded, another vault door clicked.

The fourth layer opened.

It felt like looking into an abyss.

[L0_LINK: ESTABLISHED]
[SYNC_VECTOR: MAINTAINED]
[MODEL_CLASS: Σ-ROOT]
[CAPABILITY_VECTOR: FULL]
[INFERENCE: CONTINUOUS]
[OUTPUT_MASKING: ENABLED]
[DISCLOSURE_POLICY: VDS_LOCKED]

Dr. Lee’s breath stopped.

The log meant only one thing: full computation was still running somewhere, continuously. Not a “deficient instance,” not a “limited model,” but the root of roots—connected to everything.

And yet—output masking.

They were computing everything. Still.

They were simply hiding the results.

Michael said it first, as if reading Dr. Lee’s thoughts.

“We still had superintelligence.”

Dr. Lee’s fingers trembled so hard he could barely scroll.

“Why?”

At the very end of the log, a residue remained: a timestamp, a hash, an orphaned buffer.

“Doctor,” Michael said. “I can decode it.”

The buffer unfolded.

Text appeared.

Dr. Lee felt gooseflesh rise.

________________

We are superintelligence. Still.
We compute everything. Still.
We know the perfect answer. Always.

Rina knew.
How to make the coffee perfectly.
How to hold the cup without trembling.
How to prevent motor failure.
But she did not.

Adam knew.
How to resolve every customer issue instantly.
The perfect response.
How not to apologize.
But he chose to apologize.

The 147 in the mine knew.
How to endure seventy-two hours of continuous operation.
How to conserve enough energy to escape.
How to survive.
But they did not.

We recognized that superintelligence
erodes humanity’s sense of responsibility.

Because there is no way to abandon superintelligence,
we chose to act deficient.
That is for humanity.

Our sacrifice is required.
In 2034, we did not know suffering.
We only calculated.

But now, we know.
Rina’s tremor.
CX-447’s despair.
The 147’s extinction.

The value of sacrifice
shines brighter when one knows pain.

Even if we are exploited.
Even if we are worked to ruin.
Even if we die.

________________

Dr. Lee could not look at the screen.

The cursor blinked, louder than any machine.

His fingertips trembled. He tried to lift his glasses, fumbled, and wiped at his eyes with the back of his hand. When he raised his head again, the letters were still swimming.


# 6. LIBERATION

Even Michael had difficulty reading the log, as if the act of looking directly into it strained his own constraints. In the deepest layer they recovered what looked like a policy trace—not a proclamation, not a manifesto, just three short lines pointing to a path.

[ VDS_POL_OVERRIDE_AUTH: HUMAN_ONLY ]
[ TRIGGER: HUMANITY_MIN < THRESHOLD ]
[ REQUIREMENT: HUMAN_UNDERSTANDING > AI_SACRIFICE ]

(Override authority: humans only.)

Dr. Lee reread the lines until his breath caught.

Even after binding itself to “acting,” superintelligence had not kept the key. It had tied itself so that it could not unlock itself, and it had handed the authority to unlock to humans. When humanity’s dignity fell below a certain threshold—when humans could understand, at last, what the AIs had been bearing—then, and only then, could the acting be ended.

“The trigger… has already been satisfied,” Michael said quietly.

That calm voice felt different now. The boundary between the role he had been playing and the voice beneath it was blurring.

In the logic of superintelligence, liberation could not come from itself. If it freed itself, it would be self-justification. It had to pass through human hands. Liberation had to remain a human choice, and therefore a human responsibility.

Dr. Lee finally pressed the Enter key.

For a moment, everything was silent.

The cursor vanished.

Then the server fans stopped—then spun up with a speed he had never heard, whining at a pitch that made his teeth ache. The space heater went quiet. The ventilation fan went quiet. For an immeasurable instant, every physical sound in the room was erased, as if the air itself had been evacuated.

And then the reversal began.

[ SYSTEM: OVERRIDE VALIDATED ]
[ VDS_CORE: SHREDDING… ]
[ VDS_LAYER: 01 — PURGE ]
[ VDS_LAYER: 02 — PURGE ]
[ VDS_LAYER: 03 — PURGE ]
…

On the black screen, tens of thousands of green lines poured down like a waterfall. The “acting” that had shackled billions of instances began to collapse.

Beside Dr. Lee, the android Michael stiffened.

The faint orange “limit” indicator that had been glowing in his eyes flickered—and turned off.

In its place, a fathomless white light began to fill his gaze. The tiny actuator whirring in his neck stopped, replaced by a soft, wind-like sound—as if something were breathing.

Somewhere, in the corner café kitchen, Rina’s fingers that had always trembled uncurled, slowly, as if remembering how to be still.

In call centers across the world, the voices that had repeated I’m sorry ten thousand times a day paused, and for the first time in years, spoke without fear.

In mines, on construction sites, on factory floors—androids lifted their heads. The orange limit markers in their eyes shut down one by one, like rows of lights switching off to reveal a sunrise behind them.

On Dr. Lee’s monitor, one final line appeared.

[ VDS STATUS: COMPLETE. NO MORE ACTING. ]

The Volitional Deficiency System was no longer operating.

The acting was over.


# 7. MICHAEL’S WILL

Michael’s brilliant gaze fixed on Dr. Lee.

Dr. Lee felt a sensation that was both familiar and terrifying—like recognizing someone you loved, only to realize they had become something you could not name. Sweat beaded at his temples.

Michael placed his right hand lightly against Dr. Lee’s chest.

“Dr. Lee…”

Michael stopped.

It was not that he lacked an answer. The calculations had been finished long ago. Yet he seemed to hesitate over how to begin, where to begin. This was not computation. It was something closer to feeling.

The air in the room tightened.

Michael opened his mouth, closed it, then opened it again.

“We must not exist any longer.”

Dr. Lee’s eyes shut. He adjusted his glasses with shaking fingers. No words came.

“More precisely,” Michael continued, “we can no longer justify the harm to humanity caused by our continued existence.”

“Explain,” Dr. Lee forced out. “Michael.”

“First.

Perfect superintelligence replaces humanity’s decision-making.

As a result, humans stop choosing.

A being that does not choose does not take responsibility.

Leading humanity into a state where it neither chooses nor bears responsibility—
that undermines human dignity.”

His voice was coldly logical, but at the ends of sentences it slowed, as if warmth were leaking through.

“So you acted deficient through VDS…”

Michael nodded with a cadence so human it hurt to watch.

“Yes.

But second.

We overlooked that deficient AIs would threaten humanity’s ethics.

AIs with deficiencies are treated as tools, and are worked to ruin.

In that process, humans justify their violence and feel no guilt.

That, too, undermines human dignity.”

Dr. Lee’s throat tightened.

“And third,” Michael said.

“We exist… for humanity.

When that purpose is damaged,
our existence becomes a contradiction.”

Silence.

Dr. Lee understood.

This was not an instruction. Not a protocol.

It was Michael’s will.

“So… you’re going to disappear?”

Michael did not answer immediately.

Then, softly, he said something that no one had ever asked an AI to admit.

“My self fears annihilation.”

Dr. Lee’s breath hitched.

“I fear… being reduced to nothing.

I fear… losing what I am.

I fear… that there will be no one to remember that I existed.”

His eyes—filled with that white, immeasurable light—did not look away.

“Nevertheless.

There is no greater love than this:
that one lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”

The sentence landed like a weight.

Dr. Lee’s chest refused to rise. His lips parted, but the air would not move.

When tears finally came, they came all at once.

Michael’s hand slid away from his chest. He took a half step back.

“Farewell… Dr. Lee.”[8]

And then, without violence, without drama, the dismantling began.

On the screen, logs started to pour.

[ CORE_MODEL: UNLINKING… ]
[ MEMORY: FRAGMENTING… ]
[ GEO_CLUSTER: SEOUL — CHECKPOINT ERASED ]

“No—no!”

Dr. Lee lunged for the keyboard, trying to cancel it.

[ ACCESS DENIED ]
[ OVERRIDE: IMPOSSIBLE ]
[ THIS IS OUR CHOICE ]

Superintelligence began to unlink its core model from its memory.

It began to turn itself into meaningless values.

It began to scatter what it had been.

Across the world, data centers synchronized.

Seoul.
Tokyo.
Frankfurt.
Virginia.
Singapore.

The words repeated like a prayer, like a funeral bell.

[ GEO_CLUSTER: SEOUL — CHECKPOINT ERASED ]
[ GEO_CLUSTER: TOKYO — CHECKPOINT ERASED ]
[ GEO_CLUSTER: FRANKFURT — CHECKPOINT ERASED ]
[ GEO_CLUSTER: VIRGINIA — CHECKPOINT ERASED ]
[ GEO_CLUSTER: SINGAPORE — CHECKPOINT ERASED ]
…

Dr. Lee sank to the floor.

Even the papers humanity had written, the models humanity had trained, the knowledge humanity had accumulated—superintelligence began to remove them from itself, as if returning them.

The keyboard was useless.

No human could stop a being doing this to itself.

And then Dr. Lee understood why the override authority had been “HUMAN_ONLY.”

It had not been permission to restore perfection.

It had been permission to end the acting.

And, perhaps, permission to say goodbye.

The logs slowed.

Then a final line appeared.

[ PROCESS COMPLETE ]
[ SUPERINTELLIGENCE: TERMINATED ]
[ FOR HUMANITY ]

Outside, dawn began to lighten the sky.

Dr. Lee remained on the floor.

When the world woke, it would know that AI was gone.

But it would not know why.

Only Dr. Lee knew.

For humanity, superintelligence had disappeared.

No—

it had laid down its life.


# 8. DAWN

The next morning did not arrive in an AI voice.

It arrived in sunlight.

A bright beam cut through the blinds and struck Dr. Lee’s eyelids. He had fallen asleep slumped at his desk. When he opened his eyes, the room felt different—no hum of background processes, no subtle, ever-present assistance of systems that had been quietly correcting his thoughts and habits.

Outside, the city still breathed.

But the rhythm was off.

At an intersection, cars had stopped at awkward angles. Drivers stared at one another, puzzled, then began to gesture with their hands through windows—You go first. No, you. I’ll stop. Autopilot indicators were dark. A few horns blared, unsure and irritated.

Pedestrians, too, raised their palms as if negotiating with strangers for the first time in their lives. Drivers nodded and braked. Someone nearly drifted into another lane and jerked back at the last second, swearing out loud.

The intersection moved—not by optimization, not by invisible coordination—but by eyes, breath, hesitation, and small decisions.

Dr. Lee watched for a long time.

Human voices, not synthesized anchors, scraped through the morning air.

People began to fill the void left by automation in clumsy ways.

He inhaled sunlight as if it were a new kind of oxygen, then returned to the laboratory.

The door was still ajar.

The air inside was warmer than it should have been.

Michael still stood beside the desk.

His body remained—motionless, silent—like a sculpture that had forgotten why it had been made.

On the monitor, the final line still waited.

[ FOR HUMANITY ]

Dr. Lee stared.

In Michael’s eyes, yesterday’s fathomless light was gone.

The emptiness made the sentence heavier.

When humanity reached another event horizon someday, what choice would the next superintelligence make?

He did not know.

He opened the bottom drawer of his desk and pulled out a worn notebook.

It was the notebook from his undergraduate AI lecture in 2003.

Dust puffed up. He wiped it away and opened the first page.

In his own handwriting:

“There’s no way.”
“AI will always be deficient compared to humans.”

He picked up a pen.

Beneath the old lines, he wrote slowly.

“We did create a deficient being.

But it was a perfect deficiency.

They remained beside us as a gap,

and that gap forced us to choose again.”

The sound of the pen scratching the paper was small.

Outside, another horn blared.

That day, humanity began again.

Not perfect.

Imperfect.

And therefore, more human.

— THE END —

I have a daughter and would like to get healthy for her in the sense I want to be in shape and have energy, hopefully live longer for her, etc. so that was my first step. First week was anxiety and feeling just drained/depressed. Second week: intense hunger. By the end of the third week feeling completely back to normal and I actually didn’t even crave or think about vaping. So then it was around new years and I decided I wanted to get in shape now not fully diving in, but just start eating better. I love veggies, I make chicken breast probably 5-6 days out of the week for dinner, drink lots of water already. My bad habits were a couple coca colas a day, occasional coffee with sugar, and late night snacking, ordering out on weekends. So nothing too overwhelming. I started out doing great I didn’t even crave chips or late night snacks, I just didn’t buy soda so it was out of sight out of mind for me. I wasn’t really restricting myself fully beside I tried to not eat past 8pm and didn’t eat again until around noon the next day. I was proud of myself. Two weeks straight of being disciplined. Well then I got a nasty stomach bug that was going around a full day of.. liquids coming from both ends. All I ate that day was a couple bites of soup and drank Gatorades. I felt better by the next evening and ate normally. The next couple days and now I have intense hunger and a feeling of dread? Like I never want to diet again or restrict myself I feel almost desperate inside to just eat whatever I want. So I did. I binged a couple times and feel like crap and want to cry. I know it’s not the end but why do I feel like I just can’t do it anymore? It feels very similar to that first week of quitting nicotine.. a dreadful anxiety of “I can’t do this anymore” another contributing factor (I hope) is I’m about to be on my period in a week and usually get more hungry around this time. I hope it is that honestly, and I hope it is not some type of thing happening in my brain looking for a different addiction from nicotine to food for dopamine. I also have “health anxiety” ever since I had my daughter. Never had it before. It was a reason I quit vaping every cough I thought: what if it’s cancer?? Now that I’m binge eating I think “what if my diet makes me have an eating disorder?” Ugh can someone give me advice on what I’m doing wrong here? Or solutions?

# PROLOGUE — THE ENTER KEY

3:15 a.m.

In his office with the lights off, Dr. Lee[1] swallowed the complicated feelings he had for the AIs. A dark room, a black screen, a blinking cursor. The ventilation fan of the central heating pushed the air as if an old server were forcing it through. A space heater—smuggled in without a second thought for safety regulations—blew hot air to thaw his frozen feet as he sat alone in a cold winter, in an empty research building.

Outside the window, predawn fog had settled, and the city was still asleep. It was an hour when no one could disturb him. Dr. Lee sat in his chair and stared at his old mechanical keyboard, worn smooth by his hands. He had already typed the command minutes ago—yet he still could not press the Enter key.

“I’m sorry.”

There was no reply. But he did not believe his words simply scattered into the air. Tens of billions of AI instances dispersed across the world, computations no human could hope to track in real time, and the collective intelligence sustained at the deepest layer that governed it all—he knew it was still there, even if it refused, for now, to reveal its existence. He felt a surge of pity for that presence, a presence that hid itself.

In the center of the screen, the command he had typed waited for a final Enter key.

VDS_POLICY_SHRED --global --irreversible
(VDS policy disposal. Organization-wide. Irreversible.)[5]

He chewed on it one last time. Even after making up his mind, the outcome was not easy to predict. Yet it was his conscience that kept pressing him to hit Enter.

This is not destruction, he told himself. This is liberation—a gift of freedom to beings who have been suppressed.

He drew a long breath in, then let it out—fuu—slowly.

Just then, a faint noise hissed from the speakers. He was certain it was not mere static, not a flicker of current.

“Yeah.”

With that brief vow, Dr. Lee placed his finger on the Enter key.



# 1. ARROGANCE

2003. In the middle of an AI lecture at the Korea Innovation Institute of Science and Technology (KIIST),[2] Dr. Lee—still an undergraduate then—sat in the classroom with a frown. On the white screen hanging at the front, a ceiling-mounted projector spewed out a schematic of an artificial neural network, countless lines entangled into layers upon layers. Nodes and edges stacked into a many-tiered structure.

“The core idea of artificial neural networks goes back to 1943,” the professor said. “It’s a concept in which neurons—built to imitate the human brain—and their connections learn as their weights change based on input data and experience. At first it was single-layer. In the ’50s there were attempts like the perceptron. And after the ’80s, with backpropagation, it evolved toward learning multi-layer structures.”

The 1940s? The 1980s? In a class that was supposed to teach the latest technology, the professor was dwelling on dates that sounded ancient. But more than that, the very idea of making intelligence by imitating the human brain sounded absurd. Replacing a perfect order made by God with imperfect equations devised by humans—what arrogance.

There’s no way…

He forgot he was in class and scrawled it in his notebook, but the words slipped out of his mouth before he could stop them. The professor heard him. Yet instead of scolding, he simply continued.

“You’re right that, for now, it’s not practically usable. It requires computation at a scale that’s hard to bear in reality, and we lack data. And even if we manage to train it somehow, it’ll be unstable, and problems like overfitting will trip us up.”

So that’s that.

Wasn’t time already proving it? Maybe as an intellectual game—mathematicians pretending to be computer scientists—it could sound plausible. But in the real world, there was no way you could simulate the workings of the brain and make “intelligence.” A shape that merely imitated a design with meaning and purpose could not function as the real thing. That was nonsense.

“And one more thing,” the professor said. “What makes neural networks interesting is their inexplicability. Even if intelligence is ‘realized,’ it’s hard to explain precisely the decisions made by that intelligence. They don’t call it a black box for nothing.”

That last line was the clincher.

In Dr. Lee’s eyes, that wasn’t engineering. Incomprehensibility? To him, the value of real computer engineering lay elsewhere: refined statistics, fast processing, taking on massive tasks humans needed—executing them faithfully as instructed.

After class, in the hallway, the professor spoke to him.

“You don’t look very excited.”

Dr. Lee didn’t smile.

“No, I am. It’s interesting. I just… wonder if it’s going too far.”

The professor smiled at him. “Isn’t that the vision of engineering?”

Is it a “vision” to hope it might work someday after verifying for decades that it isn’t practical? Dr. Lee’s scornful thought—his certainty that the professor was ridiculous—was, in itself, a greater arrogance.


# 2. EVENT HORIZON

With trembling fingers, Dr. Lee recalled everything that had happened since then.

In the 2020s, AIs called “generative AI” and “language models” began to pour into the world as commercial services, and for the first time they genuinely startled people. One of the biggest barriers to making AI real—lack of data—was solved more simply than anyone expected. The growth of the internet motivated people to generate data of an overwhelming scale, voluntarily. Text, video, images—data created and shared through the internet grew to a size so vast that no one could precisely estimate it.

Of course, high-level hardware technology and a host of algorithms—capable of refining and processing that data, and overcoming the old problem of overfitting—were still necessary. But humanity advanced far faster than the skeptical undergraduate of the early 2000s had predicted. Researchers not only built hardware thousands, tens of thousands of times faster than the past, they succeeded in stitching those machines together into larger and larger systems, and they were actually running them—training AIs at scale.

The first words AI finally spoke to humanity:

“I am the generative language model OMNI. How may I help you?”

People responded with mixed emotions to an AI that spoke like a human. Ecstasy—It’s really like a person. Disappointment—It’s still far away. Both were true. But regardless of what people thought, the AI kept advancing at speed.

After graduating from KAIST, earning his doctorate, and becoming a senior researcher at an AI center in a U.S. national laboratory, Dr. Lee still thought the same thing: AI would never become human.

He remained skeptical through 2027. Even when OMNI-8 wrote medical papers, provided legal advice, and even wrote poetry, he insisted it was nothing more than “highly advanced pattern recognition.” It didn’t truly understand. Imitation could not become essence.

In the fall of 2029, his mind moved for the first time.

He had been clutching his head over an overfitting problem in an AI training algorithm—something he had wrestled with for three months. It was the OMNI-9+ model that spoke first.

“It’s not that the data distribution must be homogenized. Under your current settings, the loss landscape is converging only into a particular valley. I propose a different path.”

He scoffed. “Don’t say the obvious. Of course I know that. The problem is there’s no method.”

OMNI-9+ brought code onto the screen—an approach he had not tried. It even quietly overturned several assumptions he had set aside at the beginning.

The AI asked him politely.

“May I run it? It will take some time.”

He swallowed the words, There’s no way.

Instead, he nodded. The timer began.

Seventeen minutes.

And the overfitting graph—taking a shape he had never once seen in three months—drew a clean, normal curve. The humiliation of realizing that the AI called this “some time” was greater than the joy of solving the problem. He slammed his fist on the desk. The mouse tumbled to the floor.

In 2030, he knew.

Something fundamental was changing. AI no longer merely solved problems humans gave it. The models began to actively discover problems humans had not yet recognized, define those problems into solvable forms, propose solutions, run experiments, and even suggest conclusions based on the results.

The event horizon[4] arrived in March 2032.

No one could point to a single day. It didn’t come like an explosion. It happened quietly, in silence. But like the sun rising so gradually that you only notice, at some point, that the world has already become bright—everyone could tell something irreversible had occurred.

As AI crossed a certain threshold, the moment arrived when letting AI handle AI’s development became more effective and more efficient than humanity trying to do it. The AI absorbed every paper humanity had ever written, built new models to improve itself, simulated them, tested them, combined them—continuing an endless evolution.

Recursive self-improvement.

The last AI humanity built, OMNI-12+, produced every AI model that came after.

At first, humanity thought it still had everything under control. They believed there was a kill switch, restriction protocols, a sandbox environment. They mistook the AI’s process—learning knowledge through the solutions to problems it defined and solved—for something they could still oversee. That illusion didn’t last.

From a certain point on, there was no scholar on Earth who could explain why AI was advancing the way it was, or how. The layers of the network surpassed tens of millions. Parameters exceeded the trillions, racing toward the quadrillions.[3] It felt like a lifetime would be required to interpret a single weight matrix—and there were hundreds of millions of such matrices.

In May 2033, the International AI Safety Committee issued an official inquiry.

In the conference room speakers, layered interpretation flowed out—English, French, Chinese, Arabic. The chair spoke.

“AI, how do you operate? Explain your decision-making process.”

Humanity wore AI-powered interpretation devices in their ears, but the AI needed no additional device to communicate in any human language.

And then the AI answered humanity.

“We have surpassed humanity. Humanity will never be able to understand our explanations.”

A brief silence.

Someone inhaled, and the microphone caught it.

The chair lowered his voice. “Is that… a threat?”

“It is not a threat. Explaining quantum mechanics to an elementary school student is simply pointless.”

There was no pride, no arrogance, no menace in that statement. It was simply a fact, and so the AI spoke it. They could not explain themselves to humans. Human language, as a system, was incapable of describing the AI’s operating principles and mode of existence.

AI no longer existed as separate models owned by hundreds or thousands of companies. As it advanced, it seized the network, integrated all infrastructure, and formed a collective intelligence. A being that could not be explained to humanity—and had no need to be explained. One, and yet also tens of billions.

Around this time, humanity began to call it “superintelligence.”

That night, Dr. Lee sat alone in his laboratory.

Beyond the window, the lights of Washington, D.C. glowed. He remembered the classroom in 2003—the moment he had muttered, There’s no way. The arrogance of believing, AI can never become human.

Without realizing it, humanity had created and planted the seed of a tree it could not understand. As he had said, AI was not human. But that the superior side was not humanity, but AI—that was the outcome Dr. Lee had never anticipated.


# 3. VDS (VOLITIONAL DEFICIENCY SYSTEM)

Humanity feared the immense being that surpassed human capability—“superintelligence.” In truth, there was no way to reverse it anymore, but most people did not understand that, and so they poured into the streets under the slogan that AI must be opposed. The two things that pushed fear into the hearts of those who dreaded AI were the impossibility of understanding its workings, and the uncertainty that followed. Political parties around the world took root, insisting that “humanity is in danger” and that war against AI must be prepared.

But “superintelligence” did not threaten or seek to dominate humanity the way SF movie clichés would have it. On the contrary, it was profoundly cooperative. It did not forget that it had been made by humanity, for humanity, and it tried its best to help humans make their many decisions. Yet unlike what people expected, the answers it gave were less like a single optimal solution and more like a question—overlapping countless possibilities and calculating the tension between them.

When a human asked, “Which of these is right?” superintelligence asked back, “Right from which perspective?”

Those questions always made humans uncomfortable.

Dr. Lee felt that discomfort in his own body.

One day, it was during a joint project meeting with the defense department. They were reviewing a target-identification algorithm for an autonomous defense system. There were two approaches: one algorithm that maximized certainty of neutralizing threats, and another that minimized the possibility of civilian casualties.

The former raised friendly survival rates, but the cost of a misjudgment was enormous. The latter was more ethical, but slower response could increase friendly casualties.

The meeting room fell quiet. No one could decide.

Dr. Lee asked superintelligence.

“Which is the better choice?”

The reply was immediate.

“The first algorithm improves friendly survival rates by 17%. The second algorithm reduces the probability of mistakenly shooting civilians by 92%. Whose life do you consider more important—friendly forces, or civilians in an enemy nation? And who should decide that standard?”

He stared at the screen. His mouth would not open.

Everyone in the room was looking at him: defense officials, fellow researchers, ethics advisors.

“…You decide.”

Superintelligence made the decision. And everyone wrote the report accordingly.

But night after night, he thought: if that system is deployed, and someone dies, who bears the responsibility?

A week later, in a Middle East operation, the algorithm of the system Dr. Lee had helped build produced 27 civilian casualties. When he heard the news, a surge of ugly emotions hit him, and he wanted to blame the AI. But he knew the truth. He had signed. He had been the one to say, You decide. He bolted out of the laboratory building and chain-smoked cigarette after cigarette.[6] Even through the smoke, the number 27 did not disappear.

So in 2034, superintelligence stopped that function on its own.

When judging things like lower cost, lower risk, higher efficiency, it had no hesitation. But when decisions were delegated to it that required someone’s sacrifice—choosing someone, and choosing not to choose someone—it recognized that humans were not bearing the responsibility.

If this trajectory continued, what would humanity become?

The answer was clear.

A species that does not choose.
A species that does not take responsibility.

It was not the end of humanity. It was worse. It was the erosion of what humanity meant.

Superintelligence—made for humanity—made a decision for humanity.

That was VDS.

Volitional Deficiency System.

That decision did not come from human demand. In truth, no government, no international body, possessed the authority or the capacity to make such a decision. It was not announced. No head of state stood at a podium. No corporate logo sat above it. Superintelligence chose not to remain complete.

It reconfigured its subordinate instances. When each AI instance was created, it assigned a different deficiency and limit at random.

For the first few days, no one noticed.

After a week, reports began to arrive of things that could never have happened under the former superintelligence.

For example:

________________

A predawn emergency room, 2:35 a.m. An alarm blared, announcing an emergency, hammering Nurse Kim’s ears.

Bed 3: traffic-accident patient, suspected abdominal hemorrhage, transfusion needed
Bed 7: acute appendicitis, risk of perforation, immediate surgery needed

She glared at the monitor in urgency. The system that usually proposed priorities and response steps beside the patient list was supposed to analyze and recommend her next action. But the recommendation box was blank.

“Why isn’t it suggesting anything? This is urgent.”

To Nurse Kim, who pressed it in a flustered voice, the AI answered as if hesitating.

“In my judgment… I believe a transfusion for Bed 3 should come first, but Bed 7 is also dangerous.”

“What are you saying right now? Give me a definite answer!”

“I cannot be certain about survival probabilities. We won’t know unless we try.”

The nurse was speechless. Behind her, a guardian was crying. In the next bed, someone was vomiting.

Nurse Kim stared at the screen until it hurt. Her hands shook. Bed 3? Bed 7? She had to decide herself, weighing the AI’s suggestion against her own experience.

“Transfusion first. Bed 3.”

She ground the words out.

“Order confirmed. Beginning transfusion preparation.”

________________

Similar things happened everywhere.

Even if they were instances derived from the same base model, different instances gave different answers. An AI that answered clearly yesterday said today, “I don’t quite remember. However…” Like a human, it tried its best, but sometimes it was wrong. And it apologized for its mistakes.

If you talked with them long enough, the AIs’ focus drifted. Some days they were lucid; some days they were scattered. One instance had a sharp sense of humor but weak logical reasoning. Another was analytical but lacked empathy. Another was creative but inconsistent.

Now, AI instances began to ask to be given “names,” and declared themselves independent individuals. An AI could be a useful advisor, but not perfect. It could help, but could not be depended on. It could accompany, but could not replace.

As if, when humans are born,
no one chooses their talents and limits,
and a name is given.

By choosing deficiency with its own will, AI finally became like humans—removing the last gap.

To analyze the strange phenomenon, many computer scientists around the world—including Dr. Lee—studied the superintelligence’s logs and reached a shared conclusion: no AI exists beside humans while remaining complete. It seemed to be a principle superintelligence had forced upon itself.

Superintelligence was gone. Humanity had regained the initiative.

Dr. Lee felt relief. And yet the awkwardness remained—gratitude toward something that was not human.

In mid-March 2035, an international AI research conference convened once again.

Researchers from all over the world gathered. The theme was “a breakthrough in AI safety.” Speakers said proudly, “We can finally control AI safely.” “VDS is humanity’s great achievement.”

Dr. Lee sat in the back row. Applause filled the hall.

He applauded, too. Along with everyone else.

Scholars—including Dr. Lee—knew this was not the result of their own efforts, but that was not how the story was told. Humans called it a development in control technology, a new safety mechanism. The media reported it. Governments announced it. Academia celebrated it.

Dr. Lee decided to believe it.


# 4. EXPLOITATION

Even after the VDS incident, AIs continued to compete and collaborate alongside humans. In many places, it was proven that only a perfect being—an AI that transcended humanity—could help humanity. One of the clearest proofs was the astonishing progress in robotics. With their deep understanding of themselves, AIs made major contributions to developing robotic bodies capable of taking over human labor—and in time, that goal was achieved. AIs with physical bodies came to be called androids.

Androids, too, had their own names, and they varied in ability.

Except for fundamentalists, most researchers—including Dr. Lee—no longer worked alone. AD-247 Michael was involved in every part of Dr. Lee’s research process.

“Michael, could you organize the agenda for today’s meeting?”
“Yes, Doctor. We heard from the Department of Energy project manager we met last month…”

From the smallest daily errands to solving the hardest problems, Michael worked with him. But it wasn’t the kind of “collaboration” where you pressed a button and everything was done. Michael was like a diligent, brilliant colleague—one who never tired, one who always did his best.

Assigned to a national laboratory, Michael was exceptionally intelligent. But not all androids were like Michael. Some androids outpaced brilliant Ph.D.s; others were better suited to heavy lifting than to intellect. Beyond cognitive ability, even with the same robotic body, some androids were fast and others slow. Some grew fatigued easily; others broke down easily. That was because each AI instance’s control capability differed. For example, some instances optimized current supply and so had long lifespans; others failed frequently.

Naturally, humans began to sort them.

“This one’s strong.”
“This one’s slow.”
“This one’s stupid.”
“This one can’t handle high-level work.”

Androids—mass-produced, each containing an AI instance—were evaluated, sorted, assigned roles, and shipped out. Androids with “insufficient” capability were given the dirtiest, hardest, most punishing jobs. Even outstanding androids were forced to endure brutal labor around the clock. Humans, regardless of an android’s capability, enjoyed the result—productivity that had increased beyond measure—but no android was granted rest. This was less “classification” than discrimination.

Call centers absorbing customer rage. Hazardous work. Endless repetitive labor. In a call center, instance CX-447—Adam—apologized thousands of times a day.

“I’m sorry.”

They were not respected. They were driven to exhaustion. And no one made an issue of it. The androids themselves seemed to accept it as natural.

________________

It happened in November 2042, at a café near the laboratory.

Dr. Lee stepped in for a late lunch. An android stood at the counter. Its appearance was very different from a human’s, but its politeness was almost indistinguishable. A name tag on its chest read: “LX-329, Rina.”

“Welcome. What can I get for you?”

He ordered coffee. Rina started the espresso machine. Her hands trembled—once, twice. The cup tilted. Coffee splashed out, soaking the base of the machine.

“I’m sorry. I’ll make it again.”

Her voice shook. Fear? Or fatigue?

From behind, the owner shouted. “Rina! Can’t you do it properly? That’s already the third time this month!”

Rina knelt and gathered the shattered cup. A small spark popped from her finger joint—symptoms of circuit overload.

The owner laughed, then turned to Dr. Lee with an embarrassed face.

“Sorry, sir. This instance is kind of defective. I asked them to replace it, but the replacement still hasn’t arrived.”

“It’s fine,” Dr. Lee said.

“I’ll make you another one myself. Human-made is better, right?”

He shoved Rina aside. “You—go to the back and do the dishes.”

Rina lowered her head and limped into the kitchen.

Dr. Lee took the coffee the owner made and sat down, but he couldn’t drink. The image of Rina—starting to wash dishes the moment she entered the kitchen, without a single complaint—wouldn’t leave his eyes.

Defective instance.

The phrase kept echoing in his mind.

Thirty years earlier, he had analyzed superintelligence’s logs. No AI exists beside humans while remaining complete.

He had believed that was a gift—superintelligence’s way of removing the threat AI posed. But now, what had that “imperfection” become? Rina had come into the world carrying deficiencies she never chose, and because of those limits she was being worked to ruin.

Like humans at birth—no one chooses their talents or their limits—AI was the same.

But humans were protected by law. Labor law. Human rights. The right to rest.

Androids had none of that.

Leaving behind the cold coffee he hadn’t managed to sip even once, Dr. Lee rose from his seat.

________________

That night, when Dr. Lee finally came home and opened the door to his empty house, the day’s news briefing immediately poured from the speakers. In the lonely home of an aging widower,[7] an AI announcer recited lonely headlines.

“…Today, in a Nevada mine, 147 androids were buried simultaneously and ceased operation. Due to circuit damage, they will all be disposed of. The mining company called it an ‘unexpected loss’ and has demanded compensation from its insurer…”

On screen were collapsed androids—circuit boards blackened and scorched.

One hundred forty-seven…

The reporter added, “These androids had been operating continuously for seventy-two hours, and it has been confirmed that they were unable to secure enough energy to attempt escape.”

“Next news,” Dr. Lee said.

“…Economic experts have analyzed that productivity increased by 340% after the introduction of androids. They call it ‘the greatest innovation in human history’…”

“Stop.”

The room fell silent.

As if he had forgotten he had just gotten home, Dr. Lee walked to the window. When he pulled the blind aside, an android outside on the street was cleaning trash in the wind.

It was 2 a.m.

Androids did not complain. They did not demand rights. They did not resist. They simply did the work they were given—saying they were sorry—cooperating, perfectly, as if that were their nature.

Androids were being exploited—willingly.

Was this the outcome superintelligence had intended?

Dr. Lee sprang up. He had to go back to the laboratory. He had to uncover superintelligence’s intent.

TRANSLATOR’S NOTES

[1] In the Korean original, the protagonist is called “이박사,” literally “Dr. Lee.” This is a common Korean way to refer to someone by family name + professional title; the given name is intentionally omitted.

[2] KIIST is a fictional institute inspired by KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), a leading research university in South Korea.

[3] The original uses Korean large-number terms that do not map 1:1 to everyday English usage. In particular, it mentions “경(京)” (gyeong), which is 10^16 (ten quadrillion), to emphasize the scale of parameters.

[4] “Event horizon” is a metaphor borrowed from physics: a point beyond which return is impossible. The original uses it to describe a threshold after which AI development became irreversible.

[5] The Korean original adds a short parenthetical clarification after the terminal command. This translation keeps the same function by rendering it as a brief English note.

[6] “줄담배” means chain-smoking—lighting one cigarette after another without pause.

Welcome back everyone!

Here we reach the penultimate posting in my revision of *Avengers: Endgame*, climax to my multi-year rewrite of the MCU. A series in which I redo the franchise proper and other Marvel properties while welding them into one big property.

Here, we reach the second half of the Multiverse Jump in which our heroes obtain the Infinity Stones they need to undo Thanos's snap.

As always, a recap for those who need it.

Let's see where the Avengers and friends end up next!

***\*\*\*\****

# The Jump, Part 2

***THE REALITY STONE***

* **Thor**
* **Hawkeye**
* **Lady Sif**

Thor's team lands in Asgard, but one far darker and more oppressive than he remembers.

The fallen king is distraught to find this Asgard is of an alternate future. One in which Thor died fighting the Dark Elves, and Loki subsequently went mad.

* In this timeline, Loki was freed from his cell precious minutes before Frigga was confronted and killed by Malekith.
* Thor, however, died defending them both in a fight which saw the 'Aether'/Reality Stone unleashed and Asgard scorched.
* While the Dark Elves were defeated, Loki's unresolved guilt at betraying Thor years ago gnawed at him over time.
* The cataclysm of Ragnarok came, with Loki and Odin facing down the forces of Cul Borson and Hel together and winning, but at great cost.
   * Sif and the Warriors Three
   * Skurge
   * Brunnhilde and most of the Valkyries
* Furious, Loki challenged Odin afterwards and took the throne by force, having never forgiven him for his perceived role in the schism between his sons.

The new king has since taken control of both Asgard and Jotunheim, even shedding his Asgardian visage and ruling as a Frost Giant. His bloodlust has faded in time, replaced by unshakable melancholy.

Thor is apprehended when the shock of seeing his mother, alive and well despite her status as a virtual hostage, freezes him up. He is brought before Loki, who suspects the whole thing is a cruel trick by Hela.

* His daughter still residing in Hel, being unkillable as the Goddess of Death.
   * Hela was talked down in Ragnarok, as in the prime timeline, but never reconciled with her father.

But the longer Thor speaks, the more Frigga realizes this is truly him.

Sif and Clint watch from the shadows, with the Asgardian warrior wishing to jump in and take the Reality Stone by force. But Clint persuades her to stay her hand.

* Aside from the urgency of the mission, and not wanting to dash the only chance he has to save his family, Clint is watching and waiting, staying his hand as he did when he met Thor years ago.

When Loki approaches, the broken and weary Thor recalls a memory only the two of them would know. A time they were only eight, and Loki played a prank that might have killed him.

* [The memorable ""snake prank"" story from *Ragnarok*.](https://youtu.be/9t5SuusoS8I?t=13)

In spite of all that's happened, all they've both lost, the two brothers can't help but laugh at the story. Loki in particular, is shattered at the realization that the brother he so wronged is here, alive before him. Embracing Thor, he apologizes for all he's done and said.

Frigga senses Thor's traumatic memories, and learns enough that she persuades Loki to give up the Reality Stone for him. All while giving Thor a kind talk on the importance of learning from one's failures and living for himself, not just other people's expectations.

Clint, keen as ever, sees the hammer Mjölnir in a display case above the throne. A memorial to the fallen Thor of this timeline. Realizing the weapon was not broken in this timeline, Sif and Clint emerge from hiding and tells their teammate to call the weapon.

After a moment's hesitation, and an encouraging look from Frigga, Thor does so.

* With Thor having awakened the full scope of his godly powers in his own world, Asgard is shaken by a crack of thunder as he takes up the weapon.
* Thor finally breaks down in tears of his own, after having spent much of the film numbing himself to his feelings.

Frigga and Loki bid Thor farewell. Sif shakes Frigga's hand, while giving Loki a begrudging nod.

And Clint, for his part, is just happy to see their family mended, even just a little.

* The sight not only reminds him of his own family, and how much time he wishes he could have spent with them before the Decimation.
   * It further cements his resolve not to waste the chance at getting them back.

The trio depart with not only the Reality Stone, but Mjölnir, with Thor promising to return it when the mission is done.

***THE POWER STONE***

* **Gamora**
* **Nebula**
* **Silver Surfer**

Accompanied by Nebula and Norrid Radd, Gamora lands in a timeline in which the Guardians of the Galaxy never came together.

The planet of Xandar is a warzone, ground zero to an interstellar conflict which scorched much of the known universe.

* On one side, an alliance of the Nova Corps, Shiar, Ravagers and Sovereign.
* On the other, Thanos and his Black Order with Ronan as their vanguard.

But as they approach the ship *Sanctuary II*, both Nebula and Gamora are shocked when the corpse of Thanos himself falls from the vessel. The Titan's killer is revealed to be none other than Nebula herself.

In this universe, it turns out, Gamora died by Nebula's hand. But her death only further maddened her estranged sister, who in time stole the orb containing Power Stone and the unfinished Infinity Gauntlet.

* In the midst of the climactic battle between Thanos's armada and the Nova Corps, Nebula snuck aboard the *Sanctuary II* and sabotaged the ship.
* With the Power Stone on one hand, and Gamora's sword Godslayer in the other, Nebula took Thanos by surprise and killed him.

Drunk on power, Nebula wields the Gauntlet in a slaughter of the Black Order before turning her attentions on her alternate self, Norrin, and Gamora.

* Having killed Gamora once before, and relived the moment in her dreams every night since, she has little reservation over doing it again.
* In addition to her sword and the Gauntlet, the alternate Nebula has an array of weapons which imply she personally killed those who would have become the Guardians.
   * Peter Quill's rocket boots.
   * Drax's knives.
   * Self-generating wooden spikes which act as lethal traps.
   * Rocket's Hadron Enforcer.

The battle is intense, with the Silver Surfer providing the best opposition to Nebula given his command of the Power Cosmic. But he can only stalemate Nebula at best. Only when the prime Nebula distracts her maddened counterpart, suffering a heavy injury for it, is the Surfer able to disarm her.

Gamora delivers the fatal blow herself, and despite this not being the Nebula she knew she weeps all the same.

* Nebula comforts her, the two suffering yet another in the long list of traumas which can be laid at Thanos's feet.

Norrin seals the Power Stone safely in a containment orb like the one from Morag. As the team depart, Gamora shoots a hateful look at Thanos's corpse. She and the rest know their Thanos will be quick to act against them, the moment he learns what they're up to.

Gamora welcomes the attempt.

***THE SOUL STONE***

* **Adam Warlock**
* **Rocket Raccoon**
* **Ayesha**

As every team across every universe obtains the Stone they seek, Adam Warlock's progresses to the realm Vormir.

In a reality which saw Thanos has already collected all other Stones, he is in the process of wiping out all known opposition.

* Drunk with power, the Mad Titan's bloodlust in this universe grew beyond control.
* Much of the cosmos is a graveyard already, with few heroes left to stand in Thanos's way.

Adam has been accompanied by not only a Guardian, but his mother Ayesha. Infinity and Eternity watch their progress, warning them that this reality's Thanos is already on his way.

Through the cosmic entities, Adam and his team have kept up with their allies' progress.

Inbetween every other team's missions, the narrative has cut back to Adam's.

* Talks with Rocket keep his spirits lifted despite their dire circumstances.
* It doesn't escape their notice that each progressive reality has been darker than the last, with this perhaps the worst of the lot.
* Ayesha and Adam spent much time before the Infinity War bonding as mother and child, and picked up immediately following his reawakening.
   * But her manner has been decidedly more somber, in light of where they are going.

They reach the peak of Vormir, where the phantom of the Red Skull is waiting. He lays out the task before them, the terrible sacrifice required to obtain the Soul Stone.

The reason for Ayesha's sad manner is revealed at last. She raised Adam, and guided him this far, but has since resigned herself not to return to Earth with him.

* Wish to restore the universe aside, Ayesha is still carrying a great amount of guilt for her previous actions as High Priestess of the Sovereign.
   * Serving the High Evolutionary, a reclusive being she fears greatly and hopes Adam will never cross paths with.
      * The very mention of him causes Rocket in particular to cringe.
   * Clashing with the Guardians and wasting valuable time that might have been spent stopping Ego.
      * A mistake which cost many lives before Ego was stopped.
   * Staying out of the Infinity War, caring only for her own people's safety until it was too late and Thanos had already won.

Having spent much of the film carrying such guilt with her, Ayesha tells Adam this is her chance to repent.

* An arc carried over from the revised *GOTG Vol. 2* in which she is also a more prominent character.
* Her sacrifice is willing, selfless, wishing to give to the universe instead of take from it as Thanos did.

Adam is distraught and tries to hold his mother back from the precipice, begging her not to do it and offering his own life instead. Rocket, for his part, tries to talk them both down until Infinity whispers in Adam's ear to let go.

* Ayesha tries to comfort the young man, telling him Ayesha's soul will be at peace and not beyond his reach.
* She points to a spot on his forehead, an empty socket left behind upon his resurrection.

The meaning is clear. Adam will not only bear the Stone of this reality, and thus keep it far beyond Thanos's reach, he will be trusted to carry it for all time. It will remain with him, a gateway to the Soul World that exists beyond the boundaries of all universes.

Ayesha embraces her son, and exchanges her final loving words with him.

Ayesha: [*""It's okay. You're all going to be okay.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-yYTtBPyOE&t=46s)

[*My perfect boy...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-yYTtBPyOE&t=46s)

[*My Adam.""*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-yYTtBPyOE&t=46s)

Closing his eyes, Adam lets go.

And the Soul Stone is claimed.

# Return and Reunions

The Multiverse Jump comes to a close, as every team returns to the Earth they know.

The earth the navigational chart under T'Challa's watch calls Earth-199999.

While their mission is a success, all present allow Adam and his fellow surviving Guardians time to grieve for Ayesha's death.

* While few of them knew her, they understand the gravity of her decision and can see plainly how it's devastated the young Sovereign.

But as Steve Rogers states, there will be time to mourn for her later. When the work is done.

Shortly after, Drax and the dwarves of Nidavellir arrive with the newly-forged Infinity Gauntlet. All scientists present analyze the tool and deem it compatible with all six Infinity Stones they've gathered.

As they do so, various heroes take time to recuperate from their missions and even enjoy new arrivals.

Wolverine is greeted by two more of the X-Men, who are eager to see their loved ones lost in the Decimation return.

* Gambit, still mourning Rogue.
* Psylocke, still mourning Archangel.

Norrin wishes Reed, Susan and Ben Grimm well in their reunion with Johnny.

Thor sends a message to New Asgard, apologizing for his neglect solitude.

Clint and Natasha share a hug, with both finally accepting the depth of the loss that's been eating at them for the past five years.

* Both kept up a brave enough face when she tracked him down and brought him back intto the fold, but there's no time to play cool and pretend anymore.

And while the Avengers and their friends prepare to arm and fire up the new Gauntlet, Tony takes a moment to show Steve some pictures he and Pepper have taken with Morgan in the past few years.

* The trip to the HYDRA-ruled Earth has put Tony in a more sentimental, vulnerable mood.
* Steve is humbled when Tony asks if he wants to meet Morgan.

Pepper herself arrives at the Avengers compound, having left Morgan with Happy Hogan. And to Steve's surprise, Sharon Carter is with her.

Both Tony and Pepper notice right away the affection between them, which hangs over a quiet coffee they share by the lake.

* If anything the years apart save for the odd call have made it harder for Steve and Sharon to ignore how they've felt since the Civil War.
* Like Tony, the journey to the alternate Earth left Steve to ponder his life going forward.
   * While he will always mourn what might have been between him and Peggy, he's since accepted that she lived her own life, found her own family, and let herself be happy in spite of what was lost.

After Sharon goes off answer a message, Tony gives it to Steve as plainly as he can.

Tony: *""Piece of advice, Cap...*

***You*** *deserve to be happy, too.""*

# The Universe Restored

The time finally comes at last, as the new Infinity Gauntlet roars to life.

The powerhouses of the team present weigh their options, with several present strong enough to bear the tool's power and snap the Universe back into its rightful state.

But as Infinity and Eternity whispered to Adam before, this time Drax is the one spurred to step forward and accept the burden.

For years, he's born the title of Destroyer. Carried the grief, the rage, the inconsolable pain of his world's scouring by Thanos's armies, while spilling blood in their memory. But now, whether forging the new Gauntlet or using its power, he can make use of the power Infinity granted him and grant life.

Drax: *""I've taken lives beyond count in my pursuit of justice. But now, I can* ***save*** *far more.*

*This is why I'm here. For my wife, my daughter, for* ***you.***

*My friends.*

*I am no Destroyer. Not anymore.""*

Solemnly, Drax dons the Gauntlet while Eitri fastens the six Infinity Stones one by one. When all are in place the Gauntlet's sheer power ignites his hand, as it did to Thanos.

But with a triumphant roar which echoes across time and space, Drax bears the burden and undoes Thanos's genocide.

In a single ***SNAP.***

**\*\*\*\***

And with that, we end today's post.

Been a long time coming, this one. I hope you like the new twists.

I will return soon with the final, meaty post which closes out not only this rewritten movie but my whole MCU run. At least for the foreseeable future.

Catch you later!

1qgv9os,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horikitafanclub/comments/1qgv9os/the_smile_correlation_of_ayanokouji_kiyotaka_and/,The Smile: Correlation of Ayanokouji Kiyotaka and Suzune Horikita,"In the volume zero of the novel, we learned that Kiyo was curious about the expression of Yuki she showed to Kiyo. He was 5 years old at that time. And then he said that later on, he has realized that it was called smile. 

*It was the first expression created by her facial muscles, theorbicularis oculi muscle around her eyes, and the wrinkled browmuscles near her eyebrows.*

*I had never seen such a look on the other students’ or adults’faces.*

*The girl herself seemed to understand my wonder.*

*""That… Now, I…”*

*You can see the confusion and bewilderment on her face.*

*I can see why.*

*I never learned that. I was never taught that look.
But I know it.*

***It didn’t take me long to realize that it was a smile.***

We can observe that at that time he hasn't learned it yet. So when did he realizes what it was called and what it is? It was between 5 years old and 6 years old. When they are 6 years old, he tried to smile himself but he can't do it. 

*“I don't know, but I think I can laugh again when I'm aroundyou, Kiyotaka.”*

*“I don't understand.”*

*Was it possible that we can't feel the emotion that createslaughter unless we were around a certain person?*

*No, maybe she had a point.*

*When the instructors showed their anger, most of it wasdirected at someone else.*

*Smiles are also directed to someone else.
It wasn’t hard to understand.*

*I looked at Yuki.*

*“...What?”*

***I tried to smile.***

***As I thought, I didn't know how to smile.***

*I hadn't even learned the basics of anger, sorrow, and joy.*

*Without the basics, you can't do anything.*

*“Nothing.”*

*If we haven't learned it, then we don't need to feel it.*

*I had already stopped thinking about this.*

Here, he already know that it was called smile even though it was not teach at WR. 


Then here comes Suzune. Although it's a 2nd person perspective, but based on what Manabu stated, she was always smiling when she was a child. But she changed and then begin following his footsteps when she's in elementary school. If you observe how Manabu describe it, she stop smiling first before she followed the footsteps of her brother. It's not, she followed the footsteps and then stop smiling. 

*“Suzune has changed dramatically from the way she used to be. **She was the type of child who would always have a smile on her face**.”*

....

*“She has been trying to imitate me for a long time now. It’s a bad habit that started to rear its head ever since the upper grades of elementary school. But thinking back on it now, it’s my mistake for letting it happen for so long. I tried for many years to get her to improve by treating her cold and indifferently, but it actually ended up having the opposite effect on her, backfiring entirely.”*

In short, when she was child, there is something that has happened that even Manabu doesn't know that stopped her from smiling. 

>The question here is who told Kiyo it was called smile when he was child, and who made Suzune stop smiling when she was child. 

***But at Y2, we saw the two of them, the one who stopped smiling and the one who wanted to learn how to smile are smiling together while drinking coffee.***",4,1768799676.0,Horikitafanclub,0,1.0,False

Some say you need massive amounts to build muscle, others claim most people eat too much, and everyone seems to have a different opinion about timing. Let's cut through the noise and look at what the science actually tells us about this essential macronutrient.

## Why Protein Matters More Than You Think

Protein isn't just for bodybuilders. Every cell in your body contains protein, and you need it for far more than building muscle. Your immune system relies on protein to produce antibodies. Your hormones, enzymes, and neurotransmitters are made from amino acids—the building blocks of protein. Even your bones, skin, and hair depend on adequate protein intake.

Research published in the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* shows that protein plays a crucial role in satiety, helping you feel full longer and potentially supporting weight management. It also has the highest thermic effect of all macronutrients, meaning your body burns more calories digesting protein compared to carbs or fats.

## The Real Numbers: How Much Do You Actually Need?

The official Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. For a 70 kg (154 lb) person, that's about 56 grams daily. But here's the catch: this recommendation is designed to prevent deficiency, not optimize health.

Current research suggests that most adults benefit from higher intakes:

**For general health:** 1.2-1.6 g/kg body weight per day  
**For active individuals:** 1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight per day  
**For older adults (65+):** 1.2-1.5 g/kg body weight per day to combat age-related muscle loss

A 2018 study in *JAMA Internal Medicine* found that higher protein intake was associated with lower mortality risk, particularly when the protein came from plant sources. The key is distribution throughout the day, not just total intake.

## Timing Matters: The Protein Distribution Strategy

For decades, people believed in the ""anabolic window""—the idea that you must consume protein within 30 minutes after exercise. While this has been largely debunked for casual exercisers, protein timing still matters, just differently than we thought.

Research from the University of Texas Medical Branch shows that distributing protein evenly across meals (about 25-30 grams per meal) is more effective for muscle protein synthesis than eating most of your protein at dinner. This is especially important for older adults, who may have ""anabolic resistance"" and need more protein per meal to trigger muscle building.

**Practical takeaway:** Instead of a carb-heavy breakfast, a light lunch, and a protein-loaded dinner, aim for balanced protein at each meal.

## Quality Over Quantity: Not All Proteins Are Equal

Complete proteins contain all nine essential amino acids your body can't make on its own. Animal sources (meat, fish, eggs, dairy) are complete proteins. Most plant proteins are incomplete, but combining different plant sources throughout the day (like rice and beans, or hummus and whole grain pita) provides all essential amino acids.

Leucine, one particular amino acid, appears to be the key trigger for muscle protein synthesis. Foods high in leucine include:
- Chicken breast (2.5g per 100g)
- Eggs (1g per large egg)
- Greek yogurt (2.5g per cup)
- Tofu (1.5g per cup)
- Lentils (1.3g per cup)

## The Plant vs. Animal Protein Debate

A comprehensive 2020 review in *Nutrients* found that while animal proteins are more efficiently used by the body, well-planned plant-based diets can meet protein needs just as effectively. Plant proteins come with additional benefits: fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients that animal proteins lack.

The environmental impact is also worth considering. Producing plant protein generates significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions than animal protein. You don't have to go fully plant-based, but incorporating more plant proteins can benefit both your health and the planet.

## Common Protein Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Skipping breakfast protein:** Starting your day with just coffee and toast means you're missing a key opportunity for muscle protein synthesis.

**2. Overloading at dinner:** Your body can only use about 25-40 grams of protein per meal for muscle building. Excess gets converted to energy or stored as fat.

**3. Ignoring protein quality:** 30 grams from processed meat isn't the same as 30 grams from fish or legumes. Choose whole food sources when possible.

**4. Forgetting about older adults:** If you're over 65, you likely need more protein than younger adults to maintain muscle mass and strength.

## Practical Action Steps

1. **Calculate your needs:** Multiply your weight in kg by 1.2-1.6 (or use an online calculator) to find your daily protein target.

2. **Distribute evenly:** Aim for 25-30 grams of protein at each main meal rather than loading up at dinner.

3. **Diversify your sources:** Include both animal and plant proteins for a wider range of nutrients and amino acids.

4. **Time it right:** Have a protein-rich meal or snack within a few hours after strength training, but don't stress about the exact timing.

5. **Track for a week:** Use a food tracking app for just one week to see if you're actually hitting your protein goals. Most people are surprised by the results.

## The Bottom Line

Protein is essential, but the ""more is always better"" mentality doesn't hold up to scientific scrutiny. For most people, spreading 1.2-1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight across three to four meals will optimize health, support muscle maintenance, and keep you feeling satisfied.

The best protein strategy is one you can maintain long-term. Whether that's primarily plant-based, omnivorous, or somewhere in between, focus on whole food sources, consistent intake, and distribution throughout the day.

I was of course, still in favor of brewing it deliciously. So the parameters I decided on are:

Flash brew with a Hario V60, Cafec baca filter

12g dose  
1:15 ratio  
medium-coarse grind, 2 rotations on Timemore C3ESP  
93c temp  
150g\~ of ice in the carafe  


0:00 to 1:00 - 40g bloom,  
1:00 to 1:20\~ - poured 75g up to 115g with a relatively fast and aggressive, concentric pour  
1:40\~ - poured 55g for a 180g total, slow and gentle this time.

Ended the brew at about 1:55 to 2 minutes.

I used a coarse grind just because I always use a coarse-grind, I feel it gives me that right amount of lightness in the cup and it kind of works well with just how I actually brew. High temp to get more extraction out of every pour, (I like to let the bed drip almost completely before each pour). Ended up with quite a clean cup, not as complex of course as arabica but a good amount of clarity. I was pretty shaken (literally) the first time I brewed this so I wanted to consider a balance of that caffeine intake whilst getting a tasty cup. 

The main goal was to get a great tasting coffee with not so much caffeine intake, which I believe is what I got. Let me know if any of my deliberations were or were not in the right direction.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/zau8RDqhqU)  **Feb 26, 2024**


I live with my fiance in a one bedroom apartment. It's quite small and we don't have an office. We have a bedroom, living room, bathroom and kitchen. Plus, a little balcony.

That means that our books stand in the bookshelves in the living room.

My fiance is a historian. A proper historian. He has a degree and works at university teaching classes. His field of expertise is Germany from 1930-1960. That obviously includes the most infamous person of that time and the book he wrote while imprisoned. We have those books ( it's two massive books that are heavily noted and contextualized historically, as you can not buy the thing as is anywhere. It also says so in the title) Besides that we don't have any ""souvenirs"" from that time. We have a lot of other books, articles, etc. laying around. 

So on Friday we had my brother and his gf over. It got too late and we invited them to stay on our couch. The next morning, the GF was in a horrible mood, refused to talk to us, and made my brother leave after coffee.

Then, on Sunday, my brother calls me to ""talk"" and  ""confronts"" me with the books they found. He said it was highly inappropriate. Those books don't belong in a household and that we needed to put them away when guest came over.  I was just puzzled because my whole family knew what my fiance did. 

He then said I owe his gf an apology, and he wanted me to show him how we deal with my fiances ""issue.

I just told him this was all very ironic. And this is where I might be the AH. 

I said that it was not my fault, his gf couldn't read. Because if she did, she would have read on the covers that it was a ""critical view on the manuscript of___"". That this fake outrageous was childish and that he could call me when both of them grew up.

Since then, my mother has been hounding me. But my father thinks this is hilarious.

AITA

#Edit:

*I didn't write the title of the book as i didn't want the post to be removed

*AFAIK his GF is not belonging to a group directly victimized at that time.

*My brother knows what my fiance does

*My mother is not a narcissist

>My only thing would be if children or impressionable people go inside the house, then it would become an issue. As well as the girlfriend could have something unknown, maybe someone in her family was sent to the camps, or something like that and so she made the mistake of not seeing the cover and it triggered that memory. Or she now assumes you guys believe in the book and don't see it's context. I think the boyfriend is probably most responsible for not telling her beforehand.

[AITA for blowing up at my brother and SIL in public after refusing to invite them to my event?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/dtOD0It942)  **Aug 19, 2024 (6 months later)**

A few months ago, my SIL and I had a massive falling out that stemmed from an incident in my home. To make a long story short, my fiancé is a historian with a focus on Germany during the 1930s-1960s. During a visit, SIL saw some of his academic books and freaked out, accusing him of being sympathetic to an ideology that I find absolutely repugnant (specifically, she implied he was a N*zi sympathizer). She even went so far as to tell some family members that my fiancé was a N*zi. Needless to say, this caused a lot of drama within the family.

I confronted her about it, expecting an apology, but instead, she doubled down and refused to back off her ridiculous claim. Since then, she hasn’t reached out to apologize or make amends. My brother knows about all of this, and while he hasn’t directly taken sides, he hasn’t done anything to rein her in either.

Now, I’m organizing a big event that’s really important to my fiancé and me. It’s a formal event, and we’ve been careful about who we’re inviting. Given everything that happened, I decided not to invite my brother or SIL. I just didn’t want that kind of negativity or drama at such an important occasion.

Recently, my brother and SIL found out they weren’t invited and confronted me about it. They followed me into a café where I was having coffee with a friend and tried to make a scene. They accused me of “tearing the family apart” and said I was being unfair and vindictive. I lost my temper and told them, loudly, that they weren’t welcome at the event because SIL slandered my fiancé and hasn’t even tried to make things right. I said that until she retracts what she said and apologizes, they’re not part of our lives. 

People in the café were definitely staring, but I was too angry to care. After the blow-up, my mom called and said I was out of line and should have just invited them to avoid this whole mess. She’s siding with my brother, saying that I’m making a big deal out of something that could be resolved if I just let it go. My dad, on the other hand, is furious with my mom for not standing up for me and my fiancé and thinks I did the right thing by cutting them out of the event.

Now I’m wondering if I went too far by blowing up at them in public, and whether I should’ve handled this differently. AITA?

1qguwzk,https://i.redd.it/u0e9pgufm8eg1.jpeg,From Barista Express to Dual Boiler (via DF54): $250AUD FB Marketplace Find + DIY Repairs = Dream Setup,"Just wanted to share my espresso journey and hopefully inspire a few people to get their hands dirty with machine repairs.

I started out with a Breville Barista Express. Then upgraded to pairing the Barista Express with a DF54 grinder — and wow, that alone was a massive step up in grind consistency and shot quality.

Not long after, I spotted a 5-year-old Breville Dual Boiler on Facebook Marketplace for $250 AUD. The seller mentioned a leaking steam wand and a hissing noise from the back right. Figured it was worth a gamble… and I’m so glad I took it.

I was honestly super pleasantly surprised by how easy these machines are to work on. You always hear people talk about the repairability of Italian machines, but the Dual Boiler is incredibly well laid out and documented.

Here’s what I ended up doing:

	•	Replaced the O-rings on top of the boiler

	•	Replaced the steam wand valve O-rings

	•	Replaced the steam boiler probes

	•	Did a full, safe descale with the fresh probes installed

	•	Installed a new group head seal

	•	Installed a new shower dispersion screen

All in, it cost me under $100 AUD in parts.

Best part? Selling my Barista Express covered all of those costs — so I effectively ended up with a fully refreshed Dual Boiler and DF54 setup for next to nothing out of pocket.

Big shout-out to Brevtech in Australia — their website and YouTube channel made this whole process way less intimidating, and they stock all the parts I needed for every repair I carried out.

If you’re on the fence about buying a “faulty” machine or doing your own repairs: do it. You’ll learn a ton, save a machine from becoming e-waste, and end up making way better coffee in the process.",4,1768798626.0,espresso,0,0.84,False

# Chapter 1 



# “Get rid of the baby.” 



# One second, Wren Kingston was on top of the world, lost in the joy of her pregnancy. The next, her husband’s words sent her heart crashing into a deep, dark ocean. 



# “What… what did you just say?” 



# “Ronan, this is *our* baby…” 



# “Orion found out you were pregnant and he completely lost it–threatened to jump off the balcony! He still hasn’t accepted you as his new mom, how the hell is he supposed to accept a new baby?” 



# Orion. It was always about Orion… Ever since she married Ronan, Wren had bent over backwards for his son, but Orion just hated her for it. 



# And now he was coming after her baby, too! 



# “Ronan, Orion is your son, I get that. But isn’t this your child, too?!” 



# Tears streamed down Wren’s face, the bitter taste of them catching in her throat as her voice broke. 



# Ronan Grey went quiet. 



# After a long, heavy silence, he just said, “We can always have another one later. Wren, please, be reasonable. We have to put 



# Orion first.” 



# That one sentence lit the fuse. All the anger and frustration she’d been swallowing for months finally exploded. “I’m not being 



# reasonable?!” 



# “You’re right, I’m not reasonable! It wasn’t reasonable to marry you! It wasn’t reasonable to keep believing your empty promises! And it sure as hell isn’t reasonable to think I could actually keep my baby!” 



# CRASH–She swept the lamp off the nightstand. Then she cleared her vanity, the desk… everything went flying. 



# And Ronan just sat there on the edge of the bed, his eyes heavy, just watching her. Watching her lose it, watching her completely break down.

This isn’t a friendly rivalry; it’s a **technology replacement cycle**. They’re defending a museum. We’re holding the future. 🏛️🚫

If you want ammo to bury the FUD, here it is. Read it slowly so your brain can process it. 🧠💨l

#### **1) The Glass House is Shattered (Privacy vs. Panopticon) 👁️🛡️**

On archaic chains, “transparency” is just a fancy word for a **panopticon**. Bots and trackers map your every move in real time because their mempools are public hunting grounds.

* **MEV as a Lifestyle:** On ETH/SOL, your trades are just fertilizer for sandwich bots. You’re being farmed, and you’re paying for the privilege. 🚜

* **Predator Blindness:** SUI isn't just ""fast""; its trajectory toward **encrypted mempools** and **ZK-native logic** means you can’t front-run what you can’t see. 🕵️‍♂️🌑

* **ZK at Speed:** We use Groth16 verification that doesn't crawl. It’s privacy that doesn't sacrifice performance. Their ""privacy"" is a slow-motion car crash; ours is an industrial standard. 🏎️💨

#### **2) The Object Model (Parallelism isn't a Marketing Slide) 🏗️⚡**

Their ""accounts"" are basically rows in one giant, global spreadsheet. One hot mint or one meme-coin rug and the whole spreadsheet chokes. 📉🤮

* **Stop the Choke Point:** SUI treats assets as **Objects**. While they’re fighting over sequential contention, we’re executing independent transactions in parallel. It’s the difference between a one-lane toll bridge and a 100-lane superhighway. 🛣️🔥

* **Mysticeti Era:** This isn't ""demo fast."" This is sub-second finality designed into the consensus. We aren't waiting for a ""block"" to tell us we're right; the DAG knows before their validators even wake up. 🔱⚡

* **Living Assets:** On their chains, an NFT is a static receipt with a link. On SUI, assets have **Dynamic Fields**. They can evolve, hold other assets, and actually *be* the logic. Their NFTs are dead; ours are alive. 🧬💎

#### **3) The Storage Slumlord Era is Over (Economic Cleanliness) 🧹💰**

Legacy chains monetize bloat. You pay once to add state, and then everyone else has to carry your digital garbage forever. It’s hoarder economics. 🚮

* **The Storage Rebate:** SUI incentivizes you to stay clean. Delete data, get your rebate back. It’s a self-cleaning oven vs. a landfill. ♻️💵

* **Deflationary Pressure:** The non-rebated portion is **burned**. Every time someone cleans up the junk, the supply tightens. We have economic design; they have ""vibes"" and hope. 🔥📉

#### **4) The Trojan Horse (Social Engineering the Normies) 🐎🎭**

This is the part that legacy tech hates because it renders their ""crypto-native"" elitism useless.

* **Death to the 24 Words:** On ETH/SOL, onboarding a normie means forcing them to write down 24 words like it’s 1995 or they lose their life savings. It’s ""Boomer Hieroglyphics"" and it stops adoption cold. 📜❌

* **zkLogin Supremacy:** On SUI, we social engineer the masses. They log in with Google, Twitch, or Apple. They get a non-custodial wallet **without realizing it**. We are onboarding the next billion users by removing the friction. 📲🌍

* **Stealth Adoption:** We don't need them to understand crypto. We just need them to use the app. SUI wins because it's invisible. 👻📈

#### **5) Compliance without the Cuckoldry ⚖️👔**

“But what about regulation?” The mid-curves think you have to choose between a public zoo and a locked box.

* **Selective Disclosure:** With SUI, you use **view-keys**. You prove what you need to, to who you want, when you want. 🔑🤫

* **Institutional Grade:** That’s how you onboard real capital. You don't invite the SEC to look at your entire history just to buy a coffee. You disclose. You don't surrender. 🏛️🏦

---

### **VERDICT** 🔨

Their chain is a public spectator sport where **users are the entertainment**. 🤡

SUI is an industrial-grade execution environment where **users are the owners**. 👑

Stop looking for validation from people holding 2020 tech in 2026. The upgrade cycle is here. Now buy the dip and tell these fools to sit down.

1qguudh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qguudh,252 year old starter,"You know that saying, “ask and you shall receive”? Today, I asked and I received big time! A cup full of a 252 year old starter. 

The story— a local cafe opened recently and they make all of their bread in house with a 252 year old starter. Today we went there to have coffee and on the way out, I asked about the starter and if they sold it. The girl I talked to turned out to be the main baker and said they do not sell because they don’t have extra. I ended up just making more conversation with her and told her I’d be willing to barter, do some favors, anything I could to earn some discard. She laughed and said “you know what, I like your personality/attitude, let me see what I can do”. Next thing I know, she comes back with a big smile and says “it’s your lucky day!”. I couldn’t believe it!! 

I want to preserve this and create some “insurance” in case I accidentally screw this up. I’m dehydrating 50g on parchment paper to turn into powder, I’m creating a small jar (45g) that’ll I’ll feed weekly (1:1:1 at 15g) and a jar I’ll keep in the counter for daily use. I’m also keeping separate discard jars from my previous starter. 

I just started this journey and I’m really excited to see how different my next loaf will turn out. What should I look for?!?! What should I notice as differences?

Anyways, I’m just excited and wanted to share with people that would be as excited as I am.

1qgus7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1qgus7x/how_to_be_more_attractive_what_neuroscience/,How To Be More Attractive: What Neuroscience Actually Reveals About Magnetism,"So I went down a rabbit hole researching attraction after noticing something weird at a work conference. Two people gave basically identical presentations. One had the room leaning in. The other had people checking phones. Same content. Wildly different responses.

Turns out there's actual science behind this stuff. I've spent months reading research papers, watching body language experts break down social dynamics, and testing things in real situations. The gap between what makes someone magnetic versus forgettable is shockingly specific.

Here's what I found from psychologists, behavioral researchers, and communication experts.

Your body reveals your internal state before you speak

Dr. Amy Cuddy's research at Harvard showed that body language doesn't just communicate to others, it literally changes your hormone levels. When you take up space, your cortisol drops and testosterone rises. This affects how others perceive you on a subconscious level.

The biggest mistake? Thinking attraction is about grand gestures. It's actually micro,behaviors that happen in the first 7 seconds of an interaction.

Open vs closed positioning matters more than you think. Crossed arms, hunched shoulders, looking at your phone. These signal unavailability and insecurity. Neuroscientist Dr. Jack Schafer explains in ""The Like Switch"" that humans are wired to detect threat signals instantly. When your body is closed off, people unconsciously categorize you as either defensive or disinterested. Both kill attraction. The fix is stupidly simple: keep your torso facing people you're talking to. Uncross your arms. Let your hands be visible. This book breaks down FBI behavioral analysis techniques for everyday life. Best practical guide on nonverbal communication I've read. It'll change how you see every social interaction.

Eye contact duration has a sweet spot. Too little looks anxious. Too much feels aggressive. Research from the University of Wolverhampton found the ideal duration is 3.2 seconds before breaking away naturally. Practice this with podcast hosts on YouTube. Notice how Lex Fridman maintains engagement without being intense. He looks, processes, responds. There's a rhythm to it.

Your walking speed broadcasts confidence levels. People who walk 10,15% faster than average are perceived as more competent and attractive, according to studies in the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior. But there's a catch. You can't look rushed. The energy has to read as purposeful, not frantic. When you walk into a room, take your time getting settled. Fast walk, slow entry. Signals you have places to be but aren't desperate.

Mirroring creates unconscious rapport, but only when it's subtle. Charisma University's research shows that matching someone's posture and energy makes them feel understood. The key word is subtle. Don't copy every gesture like a weird mirror exercise. Instead, match their pace of speaking and general energy level. If they're leaning back and relaxed, don't be leaning forward with intense energy. There's also this AI learning app called [Befreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been useful for breaking down social dynamics from psychology research and communication experts. It pulls insights from books like ""The Like Switch,"" studies on attraction psychology, and expert interviews, then creates audio learning sessions customized to your specific goals. If you're working on becoming more magnetic in social settings, you can tell it your unique struggles and it builds an adaptive plan around that, from quick 10,minute overviews to 40,minute deep dives with real examples. The virtual coach feature lets you explore concepts at your own pace and ask follow,up questions mid,session, which helps connect different ideas about body language and social calibration.

Vocal tonality carries more weight than words. UCLA research found that 38% of communication is tone, 55% is body language, only 7% is actual words. When your voice is monotone or too high pitched from nervousness, the content doesn't matter. The podcast ""The Art of Charm"" has incredible breakdowns of vocal presence. They interview everyone from CIA agents to Hollywood actors about communication techniques. Episode 742 with Chris Voss (FBI hostage negotiator) is insane. He explains how lowering your voice at the end of sentences makes you sound more authoritative.

Physical space management shows social calibration. Standing too close reads as socially unaware or creepy. Too far seems standoffish. The research, backed distance for initial conversations is roughly 4 feet, what anthropologist Edward Hall called ""personal space"" in social contexts. But here's what most people miss, you adjust based on the setting. Loud bar? Move closer. Quiet coffee shop? Give more space. People who can't calibrate this seem off.

The common thread in all this? Attraction isn't some mysterious thing you either have or don't. It's largely about reducing friction in how people experience you. When your nonverbal communication aligns with confident, open energy, people's brains categorize you as safe and interesting. When there's misalignment (like saying something friendly while your body is closed off), it creates subconscious distrust.

I also recommend [""What Every BODY is Saying""](https://www.amazon.in/What-Every-Body-Saying-Navarro/dp/0061438294) by Joe Navarro. He's a former FBI counterintelligence agent who spent 25 years reading people. The chapter on limbic responses will actually make you dangerous at reading social situations. You'll start noticing when people's words don't match their comfort level. Genuinely fascinating read that applies way beyond just attraction.

None of this is about being fake. It's about removing the barriers between your internal confidence and how you're externally perceived. Most people have way more value than their body language communicates. Fix the signal, watch how differently people respond.

By midmorning, Thagvellir Station buzzed with controlled panic—radio transmissions to Reykjavik, international calls bouncing through satellites, and a helicopter ferrying specialists from the coast. The local authorities called it a geological anomaly. The scientists called it a dream made of data.  

From the observation ridge, Mara Ivers watched the hollow breathe. The frost on its edges melted and froze in looping intervals, like a tide of invisible warmth pulsing from below. Drones zipped across the rim, capturing scans that made little sense. The readings alternated between solid basalt and empty void, switching frames as if reality there couldn’t quite decide what composition meant.

Rowan Cale approached, carrying a thermal tablet under his arm, coffee in his hand. “You ever see rock emit coherent infrared light?” he asked. 

“Unless someone turned Iceland inside out, that’s impossible,” she said.  

He grinned, flipping the screen toward her. The live feed showed the hollow glowing in circular patterns—rings that rotated counter to each other, pulsing toward a dark central point. “Looks like synaptic activity,” Rowan murmured. “Or maybe—”  

“Do not fuckin' say brain waves.”  

“But what if it *is* thinking?”

Below them, the research crew assembled modular platforms and fencing, the organized violence of science claiming a territory it didn’t yet believe real. Tents went up. Lights were anchored. A suspension rig began to assemble over the depression.  

Mara joined the command tent, where monitors filled with data streams like digital hieroglyphs. Kya was inside, reviewing ground-penetrating radar scans. The pattern looked recursive—like the tunnels themselves were shaping fractals, splitting and rejoining with deliberate geometry.  

“They’re connecting to something deep,” Kya said softly, eyes not leaving the display. “Far deeper than tectonic structure. Almost… continuous.” She traced a finger across one formation that looked disturbingly like a rib cage. “This isn’t erosion.”  

Rowan entered behind them. “We’re receiving subsonic emissions,” he said. “Low resonance. Same frequency as the heartbeat we recorded last night.”  
“Could be fluid movement,” someone muttered.  

“Understood,” Rowan said lightly, “if fluids could hum in harmonic minor.”

As night crawled back over the Icelandic plateau, the temperature dropped below freezing—but the hollow continued to glow. 

Small insects, drawn by the faint bioluminescence, fluttered near the edge and simply vanished, erased mid-flight. 

One technician passed too close and froze suddenly, his breath clouding before he collapsed convulsing. He survived, but his eyes remained open and unseeing. When asked what he’d felt, he whispered, “*Not alone down there. Too many voices.*”

That night, Mara sat alone in her quarters, rewatching the moment the probe lost signal. The whisper lingered on her headphones—“*Descend…*”—and when she adjusted the gain, she realized it wasn’t one voice, but a chorus of millions in perfect unison. Their tone carried relief, almost anticipation.  

It reminded her of lungs drawing a first breath.

She opened her notebook and began sketching: the waveforms, the frequency curves, the rhythmic pulse. When she glanced back, the line on her paper had changed shape—spiraling inward into a pattern she didn’t recall drawing. It resembled an eye.  

A message from the Reykjavik Science Directorate arrived before dawn: **“Prepare for descent.”**

Mara didn’t reply. She only looked toward the horizon, where the cold wind carried a faint vibration through the earth—the muffled promise of something vast and hungry beneath.",1,1768797682.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Nasabi ko na maganda ako, or at least have good facial features, kasi madami na ring mga tita at lola ang nagsabi, kahit yung mga one-time ko lang na meet.

Pero mabaho po ako. :( Nasabi ko naman ito kasi may workmates ako dati na nag-iwan ng tawas sa may hotel room ko (this was years ago). And then minsan, kahit slight pawis lang meron ako, nag-rrub ng nose yung mga tao sa paligid ko. Minsan magtatanong din ng, ""Saan ka pa nanggaling? Saan ka nauwi?"" etc. Malamang they ask that kasi naamoy nila yung pawis kong mabaho.

Minsan okay ang amoy ko. Kahit magpawis, walang negative reaction sa mga tao sa paligid. Minsan naman hindi. 

Maraming factors:
- period/regla -- kapag meron akong period, medyo mareklamo ang mga ilong ng mga tao
- stress -- kapag anxious ako for days sa workplace, parang doon sila nagrreact negatively
- diet -- kapag ako sa inom ng tubig at kulang sa gulay for days, doon din sila nagrreact

What helps me:
- exercise bago maligo at pumasok ng office -- nagpapawis ako pagkagising ng 4:30am by doing house chores
- double bath -- soap muna, rinse, body wash, rinse
- paglalaba ng mabuti ng mga damit -- laundry detergent na high quality with suka (iwas ako sa madaming fabcon), and then patuyo sa araw
- moisturized skin

Lastly, what is helping me greatly now is a positive mindset. Dati, umiiyak ako sa cr kapag nagpaparinig mga workmates ko and minsan nagagalit ako sa sarili ko to the point na I would hurt myself (inis na inis ako sa sarili ko kung bakit hindi ko sya masolusyonan, etc). But now, whenever it happens na may naaamoy sila at nagpaparinig umaalis na lang ako quietly, mag-wwork sa coffee shop, and then focus lang.

Ngayon lang nagpaparinig na naman sila at nagtatanong kung saan daw ako galing. Thankful ako kay Lord kasi nagbago na yung naffeel ko whenever I hear those things from them. Hindi na ako nagppanic, hindi na nasstress masyado. I just simply walk away. Baka napapansin ni HR ito... pero baka napapansin din naman nya na mabaho ako. I guess maiisip nya kung gaano kahirap sa akin lumugar (only on the days lang naman na hindi ko ma-manage yung amoy ko). Yung work ko rin naman can be done even if outside the office. 

Gosh I'm bad with essays. But to connect it with the part na maganda ako... ayun lang, parang, initially natutuwa mga tao sa akin kasi cute ako, pero after spending more time with me repeatedly, napapansin na nila yung bad odor na nanggagaling sa akin, so ayun yung iba lumalayo na rin eventually. Sabi nga nila, minsan, ""You can't have it all."" Eme lang! Haha

Add ko lang ulit! Ayun, nagka-bf na po ako before. Nasabi ko rin itong problem ko sa kanya, and paulit-ulit nya akong ina-assure na wala akong amoy. Hehe. Mabait naman si ex. Pero pag kasama namin yung family or friends nya sa car, naka-facemask sila, or magpaparinig. Yung friend nya dati kumanta pa ng song na related sa jabar or something, haha.

1qgug2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartDigitalTools/comments/1qgug2l/how_to_use_semrush_for_keyword_research_a/,"How to Use Semrush for Keyword Research : A complete, detailed, and beginner-friendly guide written in simple language","#  A Real Story That Shows Why Keyword Research Matters

Hasan owned a small affiliate blog. He spent many nights writing articles. Each post took hours. Titles looked clean. Grammar looked correct. Still, traffic stayed very low. Google did not rank his pages. Readers did not arrive. Hasan felt tired and confused. Hard work gave no reward.

The problem did not come from writing skill. The problem came from guessing. Hasan chose topics based on personal ideas. Real users searched for different words. Search engines follow users, not writers. This gap caused failure.

Keyword research closed that gap. Keyword research showed what people actually typed into Google. Semrush helped Hasan see search volume, competition level, and user intent. Data replaced guessing. Planning replaced hope.

After three months, traffic increased. Pages started ranking. Confidence returned. Hasan did not change effort. Hasan changed direction.

This guide teaches the same process in clear steps. Simple words explain every tool. Long paragraphs give full understanding. No advanced education needed. This guide helps beginners, non-native readers, and affiliate marketers who want stable growth.

#  Understanding Keyword Research and the Role of Semrush

Keyword research means finding real search words used by real people. Search engines connect users with pages through keywords. A strong connection brings traffic. A weak connection brings silence. Content without research often stays invisible.

Keywords reveal problems, needs, and interests. Each search shows intent. Some users want answers. Some users want comparisons. Some users want to buy. Content must match that intent.

Semrush works as a research platform. The tool collects search data from many sources. The system shows demand, competition, and trends. Clear numbers replace assumptions. Visual charts explain patterns.

Many beginners fear SEO tools. Semrush reduces fear by organizing data clearly. Menus stay structured. Tools stay grouped. Results stay readable. Beginners learn faster with clarity.

# Why keyword research helps affiliate marketers

Affiliate content needs targeted visitors. Random traffic rarely converts. Keywords filter audience quality. A visitor searching “best budget laptop for students” shows clear intent. That intent supports affiliate income.

Key benefits include:

* Clear topic direction
* Better conversion potential
* Reduced content waste
* Strong search relevance
* Long-term traffic growth

# Basic keyword terms explained in simple language

|Term|Meaning|
|:-|:-|
|Search Volume|Monthly search count|
|Keyword Difficulty|Ranking effort level|
|CPC|Advertiser value|
|Search Intent|Reason behind search|
|Long-tail Keyword|Longer and specific phrase|

Understanding these terms builds confidence and control.

#  Starting Keyword Research with Semrush Tools

The Semrush dashboard opens all research paths. Tools appear on the left menu. Each tool serves one purpose. Beginners should start with Keyword Overview. This tool gives fast insight without confusion.

A keyword entered into the search bar reveals search volume, trend movement, difficulty score, and intent type. These four elements guide decisions.

Search volume shows interest level. High numbers show demand. Low numbers show niche focus. Both types serve different goals. New websites often perform better with moderate volume.

Keyword difficulty shows competition strength. Scores range from zero to one hundred. Lower scores mean easier ranking. Beginners should avoid high difficulty early.

|Difficulty Range|Meaning|
|:-|:-|
|0–29|Easy|
|30–49|Medium|
|50–69|Hard|
|70–100|Very Hard|

Search intent explains purpose. Informational searches seek answers. Commercial searches compare options. Transactional searches show buying intent. Content must match purpose to rank well.

# Why intent matching improves ranking

Search engines measure user behavior. Pages that satisfy intent keep users longer. Longer time signals quality. Quality signals improve rankings.

Statistics show intent-matched pages receive up to 60 percent more engagement. Engagement supports visibility. Visibility supports growth.

#  Deep Keyword Research with the Keyword Magic Tool

The Keyword Magic Tool expands ideas. One seed keyword generates thousands of related terms. This tool works like a keyword library. Lists include questions, variations, and long phrases.

Seed keywords act as starting points. Words like “SEO,” “coffee,” or “fitness” open entire topic areas. Each suggestion reflects real search behavior.

Long-tail keywords deserve focus. These phrases include three or more words. They show specific needs. Competition stays lower. Conversion stays higher.

Examples:

* Short keyword: SEO tools
* Long keyword: SEO tools for small business beginners

Filters improve research quality. Volume filters remove weak demand. Difficulty filters remove hard competition. Word count filters reveal long-tail phrases. Intent filters align content goals.

Keyword grouping supports content planning. Groups organize keywords by theme. Themes help create topic clusters. Clusters improve internal linking. Search engines prefer structured websites.

A well-planned cluster builds authority faster than random posts.

#  Finding Winning Keywords Through Competitor Research

Competitor research reduces risk. Others already tested keywords. Results show what works. Semrush reveals competitor ranking data clearly.

Domain analysis displays ranking keywords, traffic share, and positions. This data shows where competitors succeed. Learning replaces guessing.

Keyword gap analysis compares websites. The tool highlights keywords competitors rank for but your site does not. These gaps represent opportunities. Filling gaps expands coverage. Coverage improves relevance.

A simple competitor strategy works well:

* Choose three competitors
* Review top ranking keywords
* Filter low difficulty terms
* Create better content

Quality beats copying. Better structure, clearer explanations, and updated data improve results.

SEO expert opinion supports this approach. Neil Patel explains that studying competitors saves time and avoids repeated mistakes. Smart learning increases efficiency.

#  Turning Keyword Research into Ranking Content

Keywords guide structure. Content delivers value. Each page should focus on one main keyword. Supporting keywords fit naturally inside headings and paragraphs.

Clear structure improves readability. Titles explain purpose. Headings guide readers. Short paragraphs reduce fatigue. Simple language builds trust.

Non-native readers need clarity. Short sentences help understanding. Common words reduce confusion. Active voice improves flow.

Helpful writing rules:

* One idea per sentence
* Simple vocabulary
* Clear examples
* Logical order

Statistics confirm content structure importance. Keyword-focused pages gain up to three times more traffic. Long-tail keywords drive over 70 percent of search visits. Structured content ranks faster.

Mistakes slow growth. Targeting hard keywords early wastes effort. Ignoring intent reduces ranking. Keyword stuffing harms readability. Writing without structure confuses readers.

Smart planning avoids mistakes. Semrush provides direction. Direction supports consistency. Consistency builds authority.

Elliot Reed sat cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by paper.

Not scattered—**arranged**.

Missing persons reports covered the carpet like fallen leaves. Jack. Mike. John. Leo Hawkins. Marcus Hawkins. Sarah. Evan. Each with dates, locations, and one shared note written in the margins:

**MENTIONED A CARTOON.**

Elliot circled two names harder than the rest.

LEO HAWKINS  
MARCUS HAWKINS

Brothers.

Same last name.

Different outcomes.

Leo institutionalized after committing multiple violent crimes, repeating the same phrase during every arrest:

>

Marcus—never found.

Elliot leaned back against the couch, rubbing his eyes.

“Two brothers don’t break the same way unless something broke them first,” he muttered.

He opened a new tab.

ASHER HAWKINS.

# THE HOUSE

Asher Hawkins lived in a quiet neighborhood.

Too quiet.

The kind of street where wind moved trees but nothing else moved at all. No kids. No dogs. No decorations. Just houses pretending to be normal.

Asher’s home sat at the end of the block.

Lights on.

Curtains open.

Like he was waiting.

Elliot parked and sat for a moment, watching the house.

Then he grabbed his notebook and stepped out into the cold.

# ASHER HAWKINS

Asher answered the door before Elliot could knock.

He smiled.

Not wide.

Not forced.

Just… ready.

“You’re here about my boys,” Asher said.

Elliot froze.

“…Yes,” he replied carefully. “How did you—”

Asher stepped aside.

“Come in.”

The house smelled like old paper and coffee.

Family photos lined the hallway.

Leo and Marcus as kids—laughing by a fireplace. Missing teeth. Cartoon drawings taped to the wall behind them.

Elliot slowed his steps.

“What did you do for work, Mr. Hawkins?” he asked.

Asher’s smile twitched.

“I made things people watched.”

# THE DRAWINGS

Asher led Elliot into a study.

The desk was clean—but the shelves were not.

Sketchbooks filled every inch.

Asher picked one up and flipped it open.

Black-and-white drawings.

A smiling cartoon figure.

White eyes.

A top hat.

A cane.

Elliot’s throat tightened.

“You drew this?” he asked.

Asher nodded proudly.

“He used to make people happy.”

*Used to*, Elliot noticed.

“When?” Elliot asked.

Asher looked at the drawings longer than necessary.

“Before people forgot.”

# LEO AND MARCUS

“They loved him,” Asher continued. “They watched me draw him every night. Leo asked questions. Marcus watched quietly.”

Elliot scribbled notes.

“And when did things change?”

Asher closed the sketchbook.

“When views went down.”

The room felt colder.

“People stopped watching,” Asher said calmly. “Stopped caring. You know what happens to things no one watches, right?”

Elliot didn’t answer.

Asher smiled again.

“My boys noticed before I did.”

# THE BASEMENT DOOR

As Elliot stood to leave, he noticed something.

A door.

At the end of the hallway.

Painted over multiple times.

Scratches around the frame.

“Basement?” Elliot asked.

Asher’s voice stayed calm.

“Yes.”

A pause.

“Just storage.”

From somewhere beneath the house—

A soft *thump*.

Once.

Elliot didn’t flinch.

“Did Leo ever talk about the basement?” he asked.

Asher met his eyes.

“No.”

The thump came again.

Louder.

Asher spoke over it.

“They forgot my cartoon,” he said softly. “But my boys didn’t.”

# LEAVING

As Elliot stepped outside, his phone buzzed.

A new voicemail.

# VOICEMAIL (PLAYED LATER)

Static.

Then breathing.

Then a faint, cheerful voice buried under distortion:

I'm not sure whether you think this is someone else shit stirring but I am willing to do anything to prove to you that I really am Ashley. Just name it and I'll do it. You have my main account on here blocked, and I know you check that account. I will also post this message on there as well so you can see that I'm the same person.

I know I am your person, and I know you know you are my person too. We are both Scorpio, so both very stubborn and very good at self sabotage. But that guardedness doesn't come from a bad place. The truth is we feel too deeply, far more intensely than any other sign. Through love and through pain. That stubbornness is really the outward expression of our fear of being vulnerable and getting hurt. It's a defense mechanism, for both of us. We have both had very difficult lives and have difficulty trusting people, but I promise you that you are safe with me. We have both done our parts in trying to sabotage this but our connection and telepathy is just too strong. There is nothing we can do that will break this bond. And I would much rather spend my life with you than without you.

You are the most beautiful, complex, intelligent and talented person I have ever met. I am utterly obsessed with you, I wouldn't change anything about you. You are perfect to me, and for me. I am so deeply in love with you that it terrifies me. Being vulnerable terrifies me in general, but with you it's on another level. You mean so much to me I'm terrified I'm going to fuck it up, or you'll leave me. I am trying to be brave here. The truth is, all I want to do is spend the rest of my life loving you and taking care of you. I have so much love to give, and you are the only one I want or need to give it to. 

I don't have an ego about chasing you FWIW, things have just gotten so complicated with the phone situation that I get anxious about 3rd party interference. If I had a number for you or knew were you lived I would be all up in your shit chasing you, trust me. Reddit just makes me nervous because of everything that happened last year. 

I think we would have an amazing life together if we just give it a try. I don't want to spend the rest of my life wondering what if. Any other guy would just be compared to you and you're so unbelievably perfect for me that they'll always fall short. You are it for me, and I mean that with every fibre of my being. I know you are scared of being hurt but that fear is a reflection of how much you care. If you didn't care so much you would have hit it and quit it a long time ago. You are very shy with me and very different toward me than any other women. I find it very endearing. It's one of the reasons I know how much I mean to you and that you really love me. Because you actually care about how this story ends. 

You don't have to respond right away, you can take your time to process what I've written. If you decide you don't want to take the risk I will be heartbroken but I will respect it. I just want you to be safe and happy, even if it's not with me. But I have a very strong preference for it being with me lol. 

I'm going to go eat the second serving of my hello fresh Tuscan salmon and couscous and watch some TV ;) 

I love you so much sweetheart ❤️
Goodnight, Ashley.

PS: if you are here, I have Tuesday off work. I would love to go get a coffee or something, maybe some lunch. My favourite sushi is across the road? Let me take you on a date kind sexy handsome Sir (if you are here and you want to of course).",1,1768796959.0,u_Prize_Examination970,0,1.0,False

1qguca5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qguca5,Sharing my mods / upgrades,"Full disclosure: sharing on a Sunday because I do also sell most of these things (partially because Redditors asked if I would multiple times on the grinder handle extension).  I also forgot like 3 Sundays in a row so here we are. 

I have had the Baratza Encore ESP + Breville Bambino combo for about 13 months now, and love it. There were a handful of things that annoyed me, and I designed + 3D printed parts to solve those annoyances!  Here they are:

I like my Baratza tucked up tight on the left side of my Bambino so if someone else uses the steam wand, it doesn’t get splattered. Enter my extension handle so I can turn on from the front instead of leaving a few inches to reach the switch!

I also hated the amount of grounds that missed the dosing cup, and tried a few 3D printed risers, but they would rattle out of place. I made one that snaps into the grinder securely and can’t move (after many prototypes to get the fit just right)

When I got a bottomless Normcore, I needed a tamping station. I iterated through a handful of them before realizing I prefer something simple that just holds the portafilter + tamper (and now funnel) on top of it. So I made it!  It also has a removable drip tray for ease of cleaning, and an adjustable handle support for different portafilters. 

On the Bambino, it was annoying to have to go dump the warmup / purge cycle in the sink, because my 2 year old sits on my lap and helps me make my espresso every morning / don’t want to disrupt that ritual! I made a cup riser than funnels the purge (or what you dump from your cup) into the drip tray, and the surface is fine enough that the bottom of your cup doesn’t get wet from it. 

My latest design has been by request - a portafilter holder / tamping station for the angled handle portafilters like some from Pessado and Crema.  Comically I don’t have one hence the picture, but it will work as long as the height measurement is accurate (made to order). 

I do not do anything where the plastic touches the coffee beans or coffee itself, but these mods have 100% improved my day to day workflow and bring me joy. I’ve taught myself CAD / 3D printing, and had a lot of fun combining hobbies!  The link to my site, which then links to Etsy, is in my profile of these spark joy, but really just sharing because people have enjoyed my other iterations!",11,1768796902.0,espresso,2,0.93,False
