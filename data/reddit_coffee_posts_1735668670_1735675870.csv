1hqmvt6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqmvt6,New run - same Rook - my whacky headcanon. (does anyone else do this?) ,"So I've started my second playthrough and a big reason I decided to do this as someone who rarely replays games straight away after my first run is because I'm trash for Neve Gallus and want to experience her romance/dialogues as a Shadow Dragon AND when I make all the ""angsty choices"", aka, don't save Minrathous, pick reserved/cold dialogue, have her get taken by the blight etc etc
(plus I do really want to be able to explore Treviso more( un-blighted) and go on Lucanis's coffee date!) 

And because I've become so attached to my first Rook, Tala and specifically HER relationship with Neve I literally couldn't bring myself to romance her with a new Rook. 
So I really wanted to come up with a headcanon that could link the two playthroughs with a in-universe reason and this is what I've got. 
End of first playthrough something whacky happens as Solas seals the fade and time gets rewound and because Rook is such an axis point for so much that happens she gets displaced and literally ends up with a whole new life (Doctor Who math) but no one remembers aside from Rook feeling uneasy for a reason she can't understand which is why she's become more reserved and closed. 

And then end second playthrough, time will snap back together (more Doctor Who MaTh) and everyone remembers both timelines (and is super confused) therefore allowing me to make both playthroughs canon so my little heart can be happy! 🫡

(I think being a big Fire Emblem Three Houses fan is part of the reason I've ended up with this headcanon 😂) 

Has anyone else done something like this for their playthroughs? I want to hear it!

1hqmv95,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hqmv95/can_you_really_whiten_your_teeth_at_home/,Can You Really Whiten Your Teeth at Home?,"Teeth whitening has always intrigued me. From strips to toothpaste, to professional treatments, there’s no shortage of options promising a brighter smile. But can an at-home whitening kit actually deliver the results it promises? I decided to dive in and try one myself. Here's my detailed experience, the pros and cons, and what you should know if you’re considering whitening your teeth at home.

# Why I Chose At-Home Whitening

Professional teeth whitening treatments are often hailed as the most effective solution, but let’s face it—they’re expensive. Spending upwards of $500 for a procedure that might leave your teeth sensitive didn’t appeal to me.

At-home whitening kits, on the other hand, offer a more budget-friendly and convenient alternative. But with so many products on the market, I wanted to find one that was both effective and safe for sensitive teeth.

# How At-Home Whitening Works

Most at-home kits use either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide to break down stains on your teeth. The kit I used came with:

* A **dentist-formulated gel** designed to tackle both surface stains (from coffee and wine) and deeper discoloration.
* An **LED mouthpiece** to enhance the gel’s effectiveness by activating its whitening agents.
* A simple, easy-to-follow process that only required 10 minutes a day.

# My Results: Day-by-Day Experience

Here’s how the whitening process unfolded for me:

* **Day 1**: After the first session, I didn’t see much change, which was expected. The gel had a neutral taste, and the LED mouthpiece was comfortable to wear.
* **Day 3**: By the third session, I began noticing subtle improvements. My front teeth, which had been dulled by years of coffee drinking, looked visibly brighter.
* **Day 6**: By the final session, my teeth were about 6–7 shades whiter. The results looked natural—bright but not overly bleached—and the whitening was even across all teeth.

Best of all, I experienced **zero sensitivity** throughout the entire process, a stark contrast to my past experiences with whitening strips.

# What Sets This Kit Apart?

There are countless at-home whitening options out there, but this one stood out to me for several reasons:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: The gel is designed to be effective yet gentle, making it safe for sensitive teeth.
2. **LED Technology**: The mouthpiece helps activate the whitening gel, speeding up the process and ensuring even results.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: The gel is stored in controlled conditions to maintain its potency, unlike many over-the-counter products that degrade over time.

# Common Concerns About At-Home Whitening

I’ve read plenty of discussions on Reddit about at-home teeth whitening, and these concerns often come up:

1. **Will it damage your enamel?** Not if you use the product as directed. The gel I used was specifically designed to protect enamel while lifting stains.
2. **Does it work on deep stains?** Yes. This kit addressed both surface stains and deeper discoloration, which made a noticeable difference in my smile.
3. **How long do results last?** It depends on your habits. Avoiding staining foods and maintaining a good oral hygiene routine can keep your teeth white for months.

# How Does It Compare to Other Whitening Methods?

Over the years, I’ve tried various whitening products. Here’s how this one compares:

* **Whitening Strips**: These are convenient but often cause uneven results and sensitivity.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Good for maintenance but not strong enough to remove existing stains.
* **Professional Treatments**: Highly effective but expensive and can lead to sensitivity.

This kit offered a great balance: it was affordable, easy to use, and delivered professional-grade results without the discomfort.

# Tips for Getting the Best Results

If you’re planning to try an at-home whitening kit, here are some tips to help you achieve the best possible results:

1. **Be Consistent**: Stick to the daily routine for the recommended number of days. Skipping sessions can delay or reduce the results.
2. **Avoid Staining Foods**: During the whitening process, try to limit coffee, tea, red wine, and other staining foods.
3. **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene**: Regular brushing and flossing will help preserve your results and prevent new stains.

# Final Thoughts: Is At-Home Whitening Worth It?

After six days of using this whitening kit, I can confidently say that at-home teeth whitening can work if you choose the right product. The kit I used delivered noticeable, even results without causing any discomfort.

It’s not a substitute for professional treatments if you need instant results, but for anyone looking for a more budget-friendly and gentle option, this is a great choice.

1hqmsbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1hqmsbv/should_i_give_her_another_chance_after_she/,Should I give her another chance after she rejected me eight years ago?,"
This is a lengthy post as I need to include some details as to why I’m hesitating with this amazing girl that I recently reconciled with. It’s also worth mentioning I was cheated on before by a girlfriend and have had trouble trusting women since.

I (30m) recently reconciled with a woman (26f) after eight years. We met when I was 22 and she was 18, and I fell for her pretty fast. She was funny, smart and incredibly beautiful.

However, I think due to her young age, she pulled some immature stunts off. For example, she would never agree to meet me by herself, and would always bring two of her friends with her, asking to hang in my apartment and for us to provide them with alcohol. I always had some of my friends over, as well, to balance it out.

Because she was so beautiful, most of my friends were interested in her, too, and she got along with them pretty well. Too well, almost, as some evenings she’d spend talking and laughing with my friends and almost not talk to me at all. Once, her and my best friend disappeared together and I later found them in the garden, sitting on a bench talking. As far as I know, they were not doing anything else, but I still found it disrespectful.

Another thing she’d do is ignore my messages for days, and every time I asked if we could hang out just the two of us, she’d dodge the question. She could also be very dismissive of me. Normally, I would take it as a sign that she’s not interested and only using me for free drinks for her and her friends, lol, but she was very sweet when it was just us two. On evenings they stayed over the whole night (her and her friends), we’d talk for hours and she’d let me kiss her sometimes (albeit, with open eyes, and never more than kissing), but we could really talk about deep stuff, and she easily made me laugh and as I said, she’s so pretty. Exactly my type.

We had a huge fallout after I heard a rumor that she’d done something sexual with one of my acquaintances. When I confronted her about it, she neither denied or confirmed, but got pissed, instead. We stopped talking for a while, and eventually the rumors turned out to not be true. I asked to see her, and she agreed (she brought her friend with her, lol). That evening went pretty well, I thought, and we ended up kissing, it was pretty passionate. However, in the night/morning when I went to the bathroom, I heard the front door slam shut and realized she’d snuck out with her friend without even saying goodbye.

I decided then that I’d had enough of her, but unfortunately I wanted to give her one more chance and reached out (she never reached out to me, btw), we hung out that evening and even started texting. However, a few days later I got a text from a guy saying he’s in a relationship with this girl and I texted her asking about it. She denied it, but I honestly didn’t believe her at that point and we left it at that.

I went about my life, got a girlfriend and a steady job as a manager at an office. Then one day, eight years later, she pops up as a new worker. I’ve got to say, I was shocked to see her. She looked exactly the same, just as beautiful, and was just as outgoing. It wasn’t long until everyone knew her and talked about her because of how beautiful she is.

I tried to ignore her at first, but she’d always appear from somewhere and start talking to me. I always go on my lunch break at the same time, and about three months after starting her job at the office, she started going to lunch at the same time as me. I don’t think she does this with anyone else, surely she’s friendly, but it feels like she goes out of her way to talk to me.

Me and my girlfriend of four years broke up, and after that my head’s been pretty messed up. I was reluctant at first to talk to this girl, but she is very persisrant, and eventually I started looking forward to our lunches more and more.

She seems interested in me. She’s chatty, smiles and laughs, she’s even made flirty comments to me here and there. Once, she even asked if I’d want to grab coffee some day after work, and I agreed. We exchanged numbers, but then she never reached out and I never did, either, but we continued to see each other at work and during lunch as if nothing.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to go back to how it was before, when I kept chasing after her and she just kept shutting me down. I don’t know if I can trust her or not. But it’s been eight years, isn’t there a huge chance that she has changed since then? She seems interested in me, I just don’t know if I should let her in again. What should I do? Could I give her another chance? Is there any possibility that this could work out? Should I ask her out, or does she need to be the one fighting for me this time?

Any tips are welcome, I’d really appreciate it.",1,1735675385.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

As for my favourites this year:
I think my favourite roaster as a whole was September out of Ontario here in Canada. They've had some unreal bold flavors and have been hit after hit for my pourover journey. Their buttercream is a strong contender for my best bag  but that honour is going to

Hatch - Red Lotus. It's jammy, fruity and ever so sweet. It's my understanding that this is the second iteration of this blend and I'll definitely be watching out for it next year in the spring (which I think is when it releases?).

And lastly my favourite new thing I learned this year is to brew two cups at a time side by side haha. I learned so much by tweaking my recipe and being able to actually taste things  by comparison instead of trying to remember what yesterday's tasted like. I can't recommend this enough if you're either trying to dial in beans or differentiate between variables and their outcomes.

So I could use a little bit of comfort — I think I’m alright but my brain is freaking out so I’m hoping it’s all okay 🙏

Essentially, I do not have enough fiber on a day-to-day basis (now that I’m 31 and this has happened to me, I do NOT plan on letting it happen again and I will be changing my diet pronto). Being very mildly constipated is not super rare for me.

A week ago, Christmas Eve, I pushed some poop a bit too hard and nothing happened. I just felt some pressure in my rectum and was worried I gave myself a hemorrhoid (at this point, I don’t think that was the case). The pressure and discomfort became greater and greater until I passed a decent amount of soft and liquid stool on December 26th. At the time, I tried adding Metamucil to my diet but I read that could bulk up stool more so I stopped that.

Since then, I’ve had minimal pressure in my rectum, which I think is getting slowly and progressively better…but isn’t completely gone. Since the 26th, I’ve tried things like Miralax, coffee, and prune juice (while having a fairly fiber-heavy, water-heavy diet). When I go to the bathroom, sometimes it is soft, sometimes it is liquid, and sometimes it is hard pellets or clumps. Color-wise, it’s a combination of darker brown stool and lighter tan stool.

I’m able to pass gas and regularly hear things moving through my stomach, especially after drinking the prune juice. There is no pain, just a very minor discomfort in my rectum…and I don’t even think that the discomfort is constant? I’m just starting to get freaked out and I feel like I’ve read all different things on this sub. Does this sound like I’m on my way to being alright? My plan is to keep up the prune juice daily, but does anyone have any other thoughts?

Like I said, extremely anxious here and would love some comfort if it sounds like I’ll be okay in a few days (but of course be honest with me 😅)

Hey all,

I recently found a small rock in a bag of coffee I purchased from a well-known roaster. I reached out to them to let them know, and they were responsive, explaining the quality control measures they have in place and acknowledging that, while rare, things like this can occasionally slip through during processing.

It got me thinking: What should a roaster do in situations like this to maintain trust and customer satisfaction?

I don’t expect perfection from any company—mistakes happen. But I also feel that finding foreign material in a product like coffee could be concerning for some customers. Should roasters offer a replacement bag, a refund, or maybe a discount on a future purchase? Or is a heartfelt apology and acknowledgment of the issue enough?

For context, I didn’t ask for compensation, and I’m happy with how the roaster responded. They were professional and thoughtful, which left a good impression. But I’d love to hear the community’s thoughts. How should roasters handle situations like this, and what would you expect as a customer?

So I sent my usual morning text to my bf (23m) around 7am. I know at times he sleeps in pretty late so I wasn't too worried at the time at 4 pm I sent another message just saying I hoped he was doing okay. I didn't hear anything from him. But I got myself into a pickle. My dad works with uber and was going out to the city my bf works and I was casually looking at the accident rates and how bad it is during the holidays. This started my worry as well as I had coffee which amplified my anxiety. At 10pm I just sent a ""I hope you're doing okay. I'm a little worried."" I started overthinking because sometimes he would at least send me one message or at least read my messages at some point. but then I was worried that maybe he got in an accident because of how bad they can get in the area he lives which then I really started to worry.  at 2am I asked i he was mad at me. 

He eventually read my messages but never responded. Sadly, I was with my mom, and my mom overstepped and messaged him saying you read her messages but didn't reply. Then he finally replied, saying how he woke up late around 3 p.m. and was having a hectic day due to his car. I felt terrible because I know I can be too much due to my anxiety, but I also don't want to push him away, either. I sent him a message explaining how I was sorry that he was having a bad day and I was sending love his way. I then mentioned that my anxiety got the best of me and that I started being a little crazy and thought maybe he died and I apologized for the short spammed text messages. this morning I sent him a message explaining how I overreacted and that I shouldn't have done it and explained how I read the news on car accidents and that my dad was in the city he was. I apologized and that was it. 

I overreacted a lot in this situation because I was worried about him. Was there another way I could've handled this? Or where I went wrong because again I know my anxiety gets to me alot but I just want those I care about to be safe and happy. 

I'm probably overthinking and overreacting about this whole situation but I just want some other opinions. 

  
TL DR bf (23M) didn't text me for 24 hours. I got worried. In the city where he lives I looked at the car accident reports during the holidays and it was bad so I started to think what if he got in a car accident or worse was dead? I sent spaced-out text messages but kind of spammed him. He finally reached out saying he woke up late and had car trouble and was sorry that he made me worry. I explained my specific worry to him and said that I was sorry for overreacting to the whole situation especially because my dad was going to drive in the area that I thought of him.

--------------------------------------------

Exploring the world of two-bedroom tiny homes opens the door to a unique blend of functionality, charm, and sustainability. The key to successfully designing these petite spaces lies in creativity and efficient use of every square foot. Here are some design inspirations that can transform your two-bedroom tiny home into a cozy haven.

### Maximize Natural Light

To make a tiny home feel larger, one powerful trick is to maximize natural light. Large windows or sliding glass doors allow sunlight to flood the space, creating an airy atmosphere. Consider using:

- **Skylights:** They are perfect for rooms with a sloped roof, bringing light into even the most hidden corners.
- **Light-colored walls:** Soft shades can reflect light, making the space feel brighter and more open.
- **Mirrors:** Adding mirrors can give an illusion of depth, making your tiny home appear larger than it is.

### Open Floor Plan Concepts

An open floor plan enhances the feel of spaciousness in two-bedroom tiny homes. By removing unnecessary walls, you foster flow and connection between living spaces. Here are some design strategies:

- **Multi-functional furniture:** Use pieces like a sofa bed or a foldable dining table to save space while maximizing utility.
- **Define zones:** You can create distinct areas by placing rugs strategically or using furniture arrangement to delineate spaces without physical barriers.

### Smart Storage Solutions

Efficient storage is essential in tiny homes. With some clever design, you can conceal clutter and keep your living area neat. Consider these innovative storage ideas:

- **Built-in furniture:** Use custom-built solutions like storage benches or beds with drawers underneath to maximize every inch.
- **Vertical space:** Don’t forget about going up! Install shelves and cabinets that reach the ceiling to maximize vertical storage.
- **Under-stair storage:** If your tiny home has stairs, utilize the area underneath for additional storage. This can be a great spot for seasonal items or extra supplies.

### Natural, Eco-Friendly Materials

Natural materials not only adds aesthetic value but also promotes sustainability. Here are some materials to consider:

- **Bamboo flooring:** Durable and renewable, bamboo is an excellent choice for tiny homes.
- **Recycled materials:** Upcycled wood or metal can add character while being eco-friendly.
- **Natural textiles:** Use organic cotton or linen for curtains, pillows, and upholstery to enhance the cozy atmosphere.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

Creating an outdoor living area can extend your tiny home’s functional space. Consider these ideas to integrate nature into your design:

- **Deck or patio:** A small deck with seating can be a great space for morning coffee or evening relaxation.
- **Vertical gardens:** If yard space is limited, vertical gardens can be a trendy way to introduce greenery and enhance your tiny home's aesthetic.

### Personality

Your tiny home should reflect your personal style. Here’s how you can infuse character into your two-bedroom space:

- **Accent walls:** A bold wallpaper or paint color on one wall can create a focal point without overwhelming the space.
- **Art displays:** Showcase your favorite artwork or photographs to personalize your living area.
- **Unique light fixtures:** Choose interesting lamps or pendant lights that make a statement and enhance the overall ambiance.

In sum, designing a two-bedroom tiny home can be a rewarding project filled with innovation and personal expression. By focusing on maximizing space, using smart storage solutions, and reflecting your unique style, you can create a charming and livable miniature dwelling that feels just right for you. Embrace the challenges of tiny living and watch your dreams of a cozy home come to life!

- **Quality over Quantity:** You learn to appreciate what you have and spend more time with loved ones rather than things.

This kind of mindful living can significantly enhance your quality of life.

### Community Connection

Many tiny homes are found in communities where residents share common values about sustainable living and simplicity. Being part of a tiny home community can help you forge stronger connections with your neighbors. Social activities are often organized, fostering a sense of belonging and camaraderie. This supportive environment can greatly improve your overall social life.

### Flexibility and Mobility

A 2 bedroom tiny home offers a degree of flexibility that traditional homes don’t. Depending on the design, many tiny homes are built on trailers, allowing you to relocate seamlessly as needed. Imagine being able to explore different locations while still enjoying the comforts of home. This mobility can be particularly appealing for those who love to travel or work remotely.

### Customization Opportunities

When it comes to designing your tiny home, the possibilities are endless. You can tailor the interior to suit your style and needs. Whether you prefer an open floor plan or specific design features, living in a tiny home gives you the opportunity to create a space that reflects you. This personalized touch can make your living experience even more enjoyable.

Choosing to live in a 2 bedroom tiny home can lead to financial freedom. With lower living costs and the possibility of reduced debt, many people find they can save more money. This financial cushion allows for increased flexibility in life choices, such as traveling, pursuing hobbies, or investing in education. The freedom that comes with financial stability enhances your overall life satisfaction.

Living in a 2 bedroom tiny home is much more than just having less space. It’s about embracing a lifestyle that promotes efficiency, sustainability, community, and financial freedom. By choosing this path, you may find yourself happier, more connected, and free to focus on what truly matters to you.

### Conclusion

# What is WeOU?

WeOU is a gamified IOU system that tracks and values exchanged services, goods, and favors. It's designed to be fair, transparent, and flexible, using USD as a familiar backbone to ensure clarity and trust.

# How It Works

1. **IOUs as a Measurement of Worth**
   * Instead of vague favors or ambiguous debts, IOUs are quantified using real value (e.g., $50 USD equivalent for a bike repair).
   * Values are calculated using a **walkthrough tool** that accounts for time spent, material costs, difficulty, and hidden expenses like gas.
2. **Group IOU Pools**
   * Similar to group chats, these pools create accountability within small groups, peer-to-peer arrangements, handshake agreements, or even community-wide exchanges.
   * Perfect for roommates sharing utility costs, the dad who always picks up the tab, the too-generous handyman who undervalues their time (speaking from experience!), or friends with shared interests like a monthly D&D and beer night.
   * Can be scaled up to serve as a community ledger for shared projects and local marketplaces
3. **Value Calculator**
   * A straightforward system that considers time invested, specialized skills required, materials used, physical effort, and hidden costs to determine fair value.
   * Inspires transparency and encouragement to value one’s time effectively
4. **Wish-list Items**
   * Members can post needed goods or services, allowing those with IOUs to settle debts by fulfilling these requests instead of using **cash-app, venmo, paypal**.
   * Creates an atmosphere of **intentional gift-giving** rather than transactional debt collection.
5. **Reducing Money Awkwardness**
   * Addresses the uncomfortable dynamics money can create in personal relationships.
6. **Building Lasting Connections**
   * Encourages ongoing relationships rather than one-off transactions.
   * Members can exit anytime after zeroing their balance, with cash buy-outs available as an exit strategy.
      1. Optional debt forgiveness keeps things flowing smoothly.

# How I’ve Done This with My Workmates

This isn’t just a theoretical idea—I’ve already been using a prototype version of WeOU with my workmates, and it’s worked great! Here’s how we set it up:

1. **Debt Pool with a Shared Spreadsheet**
   * We created a shared Google Sheet where all debts and exchanges were logged.
   * Each entry included:
      * Borrower: Who benefited.
      * Lender: Who provided.
      * Date, Amount, and a Short Description (e.g., “Coffee,” “Gas money,” or “Espresso machine pitch”).
2. **Formulas to Track Balances**
   * Each person’s balance was tracked with simple formulas:
      * **Owed:** `=SUMIFS(Total, Lender, [Name])`
      * **Owe:** `=SUMIFS(Total, Borrower, [Name])`
      * **Debt:** `=Owed - Owe`
3. **Group Dynamics**
   * We treated the debt pool as a collective system where everyone could keep track of what they owed and were owed.
   * If someone left the group, their debts had to be settled or forgiven to ensure the pool stayed clean.

This system not only kept things transparent but also made it fun to track who “owed” the next coffee or owed a larger favor.

And (because I love this shit) I even made an appsheet app with charts!

# How It Builds on the Micro Movement

The original Micromovement proposed a new currency system at 1/100th of USD value to increase accessibility. **However, feedback showed this fraction created unnecessary complexity and hindered adoption.** By using USD-backed IOUs, **WeOU bridges that gap** while maintaining clarity.

WeOU offers:

* A **transparent calculation tool** for fair valuation (developed with input from professional wage compensation lawyers).
* **Creative trade opportunities** that preserve the Micro Movement's spirit of goodwill and resource sharing.
* A **gamified layer** making value exchange fun and engaging for personal use, small businesses, or mutual aid.

# To Clarify

This would be an **open-sourced** **system** encouraging anybody and everybody to use, expand, evolve, and/or *perfect* it.

Like a system template to try and modify for yourself!

# Would You Use It?

They do not really need espresso or any fancy kind of coffees, more like traditional americano - as both like their coffees with different strengths it would be better to use the machine per cup and if possible to manually choose the intensity or strentgh of the coffee.

I on the other hand didn’t have any prior experience in such a field. oh the months we lived together I constantly was catching things that monogamous typically aren’t supposed to be doing. I found him constantly sexting multiple people at a time so I finally blew up on him about what the hell is going on. At that point I was seriously ready to end it and leave and I almost did cause I had enough of the abuse however my heart is too big and I let it slide. At this rate I have no trust with him.

* **First thing after waking up**: A **protein shake** (with 400ml milk + coffee added).
* **2-3 hours later**: Another **protein shake** (same as the first).
* **One meal at 5-6pm**: A **5-egg veggie omelet** with 2 slices of multigrain bread.
* **Snacks**: Some nuts if I feel hungry. Occasionally, I’ll have a **Chobani yogurt** (about 3 times a week).

* 1 **avocado** and 2 more slices of multigrain bread to my diet.

I do miss our connection tho. I know we had our fun. But this is all for the best, right? Anyway, I still do hope good things for you. Just be good please. I still have high hopes for you despite it all.",1,1735674227.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1hqmbpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hqmbpg/how_to_get_the_courage_to_confront_my_husband/,How to get the courage to confront my husband? (Update),"I posted about this about three weeks ago, and I wanted to give an update. I think some of the things I've learned since then may be helpful in the advice given out in this sub


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h89pq1/how_to_get_the_courage_to_confront_my_husband/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button


First, let me address some of the common comments from the original thread: 


Medical neglect/call CPS: so, I did call a lawyer and talked about this one with him. He said the state gives a lot leeway for parents to choose how to treat their kids conditions. Choosing alternative or natural methods isn't neglect, in fact it shows you're trying. The state doesn't really care if it works or not. He also said CPS is looking for signs of physical abuse, so they likely would not care either. 


Domestic abuse hotline: I called these people as well and described what's happening to me and my child. They did say that my husband's behavior is emotional abuse/manipulation, but that's not criminal. He's also not physically abusing our child and neglect isn't in their scope, so a domestic violence shelter wouldn't take me (as nobody is in imminent danger). She did say I should leave him though. 


Take your kid and run: going back to the conversation with the lawyer, from the state's point of view, my husband and I are two people with different opinions on how to treat our toddler, and they don't value either of our opinions above the other. I have no legal standing to escape with my child, in fact that would be considered kidnapping and would ruin my chances of getting custody in the divorce. 


He can't kick you out: yes, the lawyer agreed with this statement. But also, I can't kick him out. But, what would life be like living with someone you're trying to divorce? Wake up, get cussed out. Try to make lunch, get cussed out for using the bread... The lawyer did suggest that I should be the one to move out to spare me some emotional well being. Also, he said if I really disagree with my husband's treatment of our toddler, then I should move out to prove it. Otherwise, by staying it makes it look like I agree with him. 


How can anyone ban you from drinking coffee: it's true he doesn't slap coffee out of my hand (maybe he would if he had the chance), but he can make my life hell. Wanna get some pizza? No, you wasted our money on coffee. Need an oil change on my car? Can't, you wasted our money on coffee. Wanna watch some Netflix? I cancelled it to save money for your coffee. I'm feeling sick? It's because you drank all that coffee. 


Grow a backbone: oh! Totally forgot I could do that! Problem solved!  Like, I wish I could be a different person. I see that the way I am has led me here, and is hurting my child. I wish I could fundamentally change myself. I wish I could throw who I am into the garbage and just become someone else. I would love to do therapy and get help, but that could take years and for my child's sake I can't wait that long. Thus i turned to Reddit in hopes of learning about some meditation technique or something to get me to tell him I'm leaving. 


So, now we get to my current dilemma. As stated above, he has done nothing wrong in the legal sense, so I have no standing to kick him out or to take my child and run. Since it'll be almost impossible to force him to leave, that means i have to leave. But, then I can't take my kid with me and it could be a few weeks to work with the lawyer and get an injunction filed to force him to grant me 50/50 custody (the states default until custody is officially decided). I understand that long term, it'll be worth it. But it's so hard to consider leaving my kid behind. 


And so, unfortunately, I'm still with him. I'm sorry to disappoint everyone. I wish I had better news, or even some kind of plan to move forward. It's not easy to go nuclear on your life. In good news, I did convince him to take our kid to urgent care. However, 10 minutes before the appointment he suddenly changed his mind and cancelled. But then, later that night he suddenly decided that our toddler was so sick we need to go to the ER. It turns out she has a common cold virus and a double ear infection. They gave us some antibiotics for her, and after some arguing I convinced my husband to actually use them. I opted to stay in the marriage to make sure my child actually gets the medicine and my husband didn't just quit it. Then it was Christmas, and the holidays seemed like a bad time for a break up... Excuses, excuses, I know. 


And so, here I am. I am still hoping to have a confrontation and get out of this relationship. I'm not going to post anymore updates here because at this point it's just drama. Thank you to all those who posted previously for your advice and support.

It's a big deal for everyone, not just the Amazonians being told to show up.  As someone who's worked at Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Zulily, I've seen firsthand how the remote work revolution has changed things. My name's Ermenildo Valdez Castro, Jr. - most folks call me Ernie. 

 It's a bit of a double-edged sword. You've got Amazon CEO Andy Jassy saying it's all about strengthening the company's culture and teams. Makes sense, right? Collaboration, that kind of thing. Plus, they're trying to be more efficient.  I remember when I was at Amazon, back when they were still a little startup (ha!), we used to all be crammed into one big room, and the energy was electric. You just felt it.  But then, things changed. Remote work took over, and while it worked for a while, it definitely had its downside.  

 For those folks who enjoy being in the office, it's a win. They get to socialize with colleagues, escape the distractions of home, and maybe even score some free snacks.  I remember back when I was at Microsoft, they had this killer coffee bar in the building. I'd spend hours in there just chatting with colleagues and brainstorming.  

 But then there are those who are bummed about having to return to the office.  You hear them talk about the traffic, the long commutes, and the lack of flexibility. I get it. I've been there. I used to live in Redmond, and I know how bad the traffic can be.  

 Now, the thing is, I'm not one to take sides on this whole work-from-home versus office thing.  I've done both, and I've seen the pros and cons of each. What really matters is finding what works best for you and your company.  I'm all about adapting to change, that's what keeps me going.  I've seen a lot of change in my career, but I've also seen a lot of success. It's all about finding what works for you and your team.

DAY 2: Check out the West side of the city 
- Explore Ximending
- Visit Lungshan Temple
- Check out Dihua Street
- Visit Ningxia Night Market
- Depending on energy levels, visit one of the riverside parks like Yanping or Huazhong

DAY 3: Explore the southern parts, especially Wenshan District
- Go up Maokong Gondola, explore
- Check out Zhangshan Temple 
- Visit Taipei 101 in the evening, maybe have a coffee at the top 

DAY 4: Day trip to Jiufen/Shifen

DAY 5: Northern parts of the city, Zhongshan/Neihu
- Jinmianshan trail
- Bishanyan Temple

Sure, there are a MULTITUDE of reasons. The economy being one of the bigger ones, and culture war....yes. But the biggest reason above all else is something that's been expanding for the past few decades and is now taking into affect.

I'm sounding the alarm on this issue for one last time. Others have predicted this, and I've probably explained this to people so many times that I'm posting my thoughts here so it has a home. It's a little lengthy but thought-provoking and worth while. Interesting talking points and introspection.

So, humans are more anti-social than ever before. We are all denatured compared to how we should be. We spend so much time on devices, phones, social media, video games, streaming services, etc. And there's GOING to be repercussions of this.

So many people can't make eye contact with others now, for one thing. Many people struggle to make conversation with others. And attention span is cooked with tik tok or Instagram shorts, Youtube shorts, etc. Plus poor diets and processed food consumption won't help with your image or mental health.

It's like people are showing autistic tendencies even without being autistic. It's more profound with Gen Z and Millennials yet it's affecting everyone. And then we DO have more profound mental illness than ever before, from disabilities to schizos and psychos, etc. And the internet is a really toxic place to be, especially for THOSE types of people.

We can't communicate with others. We can't open up ourselves with others. We don't have the attention span to focus on others and their needs and wants. I can think of guys who would rather play Skyrim then go out on a date with a girl.

But it's not just relationships. People are anti-social even when it comes to trying to make friends with others and just socialize point-blank. People talk about there being a ""male"" loneliness epidemic, or ""female"" loneliness epidemic. I hate it. Maybe there's just a LONELINESS EPIDEMIC FOR EVERYONE brought to us by modern industrial society and it's consequences.

People are listening to music and on their phones while out in public, instead of trying to talk to those around them. It's hurting our abilities to socialize, it's became a retreat. And then people see depressing things on social media; that can make them feel ugly, poor, or bad about their self-image in other ways. 

We have dating apps like Tinder or Bumble that encourage one night stands....which leads to people NOT BEING ABLE TO TAKE RELATIONSHIPS AND LOVE SERIOUSLY. 

Then we have culture wars. We have women saying that men are disgusting and aren't giving it their best. We have men saying that women are uninteresting and have nothing to bring once you get past being horny. Social media has exacerbated this divide tenfold.

It feels like no one is trying their best because we're all degenerated and denatured compared to what we should be. We're all depraved. We get no sleep, go off of coffee and junk food, work all day, come home and watch TV, or porn, or play videogames or something....and that's it. We've been rotted by consumerism and materialism. 

And then with mental illness and depression at an all time high too, it feels like men or women have nothing to bring; and it's because we're all sick. We're not the way that we should be anymore. We literally have porn addicts who can't get a partner, and would rather just watch porn then trying to fix their lives and get into a relationship....these problems go on and on.

Capping it off, here's some food for thought. Another issue is a MATURITY and RESPONSIBILITY issue. Kids over a decade ago went outside a lot more, and participated in sports and activities a lot more. They don't socialize or make friends in the neighborhood now, they're inside.

Less kids have jobs today than before (and we noticed these trends a few years ago yet no one sounded the alarm.) Less kids drive than before....and when we have negative stats like obesity rising, it seems like people are getting lazier and lazier.

I've said a lot, so to recap, what is the issue? We're denatured and degenerated by the technology and culture around us. We're less responsible, more tired, and sure....more ""stupid"" than ever before. We can't communicate with others...and all of these things has led to the fertility crisis we're seeing now, along with the loneliness that we're seeing among people.

It falls back to the concepts of MODERN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND IT'S CONSEQUENCES. Then what's the solution? I really don't know....maybe ditching the electronic devices, going outside and interacting with people, and being more active?

We're all in the same boat here. Just navigating through the fog; and compassion and understanding is key so we can communicate with each other, and try to work together.",0,1735673485.0,conspiracy,4,0.5,False

I am positive this is a high quality one and likely far from extreme since I got it from S&W whom I love and have found descriptions spot on.

I’ve been taking a break from pourover so any suggestions on adjustments from my base Clever recipe: 20g medium fine - also not slow fed, but if reduced fines might be a plus I sometimes do that since a have a very basic Chestnut C2 that produces lots of those- with 197 F, 310-320g water, water first and only stir to get grounds coated, steep 2:30, rotate one way and the other gently, release at 3:15.

I know how to adjust based on normally processed coffee of different density, roast, age, origin, etc., but idea of what to adjust and how out of grind, ratio, agitation, time in the case of not digging this lychee infused bean?

The only other thing would be more rest. This was made at exactly the low end of suggested minimum rest (2.5 weeks). Not sure if longer changes it in a way I’d prefer

Honestly not that concerned but since I know how to adjust my pourover and immersions to suit my tastes across normal coffees I’m now really curious if one can impact the influence of a coferment ",1,1735673144.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to request leave from January 2nd, 2025, for one week, as I feel the need to take a break to relax and recharge. Currently, I am not receiving enough work, and I believe it would be beneficial to take this time off.

I have always tried to be proactive by suggesting new business opportunities, such as the call center initiative in India, to help grow the company. However, I have not received any feedback or follow-up on these proposals.

I also want to address my current role. While I am always eager to contribute to the company, I am not being given enough work to do. I do not feel comfortable receiving a salary without having meaningful tasks to complete. I prefer to stay engaged and contribute actively. If there is a need for me to take on additional responsibilities, I am happy to do so, but at the moment, I am not receiving sufficient assignments.

Additionally, there was an instance where I was asked to serve coffee and tea to guests. While I understand that anyone in the office may be asked to do this occasionally, I believe my skills and experience are better suited for more client-focused work, not basic office tasks. If the company requires someone to handle office support duties, it may be more appropriate to hire someone specifically for that role.

I also want to clarify that whenever I am on leave, I always inform you in advance via email. Despite this, I have noticed salary deductions when I take time off. I believe this is unfair, especially since I continue to work long hours, even during nights (from 6 PM to 5 AM), whenever necessary.

Finally, if the company feels that my services are no longer needed or if there are no suitable tasks for me, I would appreciate it if you could inform me in advance. This will allow me enough time to look for another job. I am open to exploring new opportunities, but I would prefer to know where I stand so I can plan accordingly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

And here they are, facing the Boston Celtics, a team that’s been hotter than a jalapeño in a sauna. The Celtics have been averaging a scorching 119.5 points per game, while the Raptors have been averaging... well, let’s just say they’ve been consistent in their quest to redefine the term ""underdog.""

With the Celtics as a 17-point favorite, it’s like betting on whether the sun will rise tomorrow. The Raptors have lost their last 10 games, including a 29-point drubbing by the Hawks, which is about as encouraging as a motivational speech from Eeyore. Boston has been sinking threes like they’re going out of style, averaging 18.4 per game, while the Raptors are stuck at 11.4, probably because they’re too busy wondering why the hoop is so high up.

Now, let's talk betting. The Celtics are priced at a measly 1.07 to win outright, which is about as appealing as a lukewarm cup of coffee. Meanwhile, the Raptors are sitting at a juicy 9.5, which is tempting if you believe in miracles or have a penchant for burning money. The spread is set at 16.5, and while the Raptors have been decent against the spread, asking them to cover against a Celtics team that’s been treating them like a piñata is a tall order.

The over/under is set around 232 points, and given Boston's scoring prowess and Toronto's generous defense, taking the over seems like the smart play. So, if you're looking for a New Year's Eve bet that might actually pay off, consider the over on total points.

So, even though I'm trying to be as clear as possible my order is still getting taken wrong. Like for example, the location that I just went to I ordered a white hazelnut bark iced decaf with oat milk no cream. She ordered a regular white hazelnut bark iced coffee with cream and had to have them remake it twice. They also forgot a food item i bought. 
This is at all local locations though which is why I'm concerned. I know we're all tired and overworked and the economy sucks but I used to work at dunkin. I didn't get orders wrong like this. I'm sure if I just ordered something  simple like a regular decaf and a donut it would be fine. It's the complicated orders that's likely  causing the hiccup. 

Is the user interface not particularly user friendly anymore? 
Are there any tips for how i can clearly say my order?

I’m a 20-something undergrad studying here in Singapore, and I’ve just started exploring sugar dating. Over the past few months, I’ve gone on a handful of paid “first meets,” and it’s pretty mind-blowing that some guys are willing to pay up to $500 just to chat over coffee. Compared to the usual part-time gigs (like tutoring or waitressing), this seems a lot more lucrative.

But I’m at a crossroads and would love some insight from others who’ve been there or know more about it. Here’s what I’m wondering:

1. **Balancing Studies & Sugar Dating:** University life here can be intense—projects, finals, internships, and all. If you’ve tried sugar dating in Singapore, did it interfere with your studies or future career prospects?
2. **Safety Tips (Singapore Edition):** For me, meeting in public places (cafés or malls) and telling a friend my location is a must. But are there any other red flags or safety measures I should look out for locally? What’s worked best for you?
3. **Emotional Boundaries & Expectations:** Some men seem interested in more than just conversation (and sometimes it’s more emotional rather than purely transactional). Any advice on how to set limits or avoid awkwardness?
4. **Financial Aspect & Sustainability:** The extra cash is tempting, but is it a reliable income stream here in Singapore? Is there a point where things taper off? If anyone has tips on smart budgeting or investing these earnings, I’d love to hear them.
5. **Social Stigma & Privacy:** I’m a bit worried about what friends, family, or future employers might think. Singapore is small, and word can travel fast. How do you maintain privacy or handle judgment if people find out?
6. **Long-Term Pros & Cons:** I’m not sure if this is just a short-term fix for my uni days or something that can last longer. Would love any real stories, both successes and cautionary tales, to help me make an informed decision.

I’m really curious to hear from people with firsthand experience or anyone who’s done thorough research on this scene. I want the good, the bad, and the honest. Let me know what you wish you had known before you started, and what you’d advise someone just dipping her toes in now.

Thanks so much in advance for any insights you can share!

**TL;DR:**  
I’m an undergrad in Singapore who’s tried a few sugar dating “first meets” and found the pay surprisingly high (up to $500 to chat). Now I’m wondering if it’s worth pursuing, and I’d love advice on everything from safety to dealing with stigma and planning ahead.

1hqlpuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1hqlpuy/solo_trip_to_southern_morocco_report/,Solo trip to southern Morocco - report,"Solo trip to Moroccoo 

(long time lurker, first time poster)

Hey fellow travelers, happy new Year to you! I wanted to share my experience of a  week solo trip to Morocco. I went to Marrakech, Agadir and Essaouira, so mostly south/west part off the country.

Marrakech has very unique arabic/berber atmophere, with very interesting basars, medina and (what I liked the most) night market, where people make music, dance, tell stories and offer imho weird but interesting games to the public (like rod ""fishing"" for soda bottles). Unfortunately, they also had lots of monkeys on chains, that looked not too well treated. People there will try to start a convo with you, but mostly they will want money form you.

Marrakech (most places) is very pricey in terms of eating outside andd hotels/hostels - comparable to lets say Germany. A coffee will be around 40 DHS (~4 EUR), a lunch around 100 DHS. People that I met in hostels went to the Jardin Majorelle (well mantained gardens, 30 mins visit) and Saadian Tombs, paid around 170 DHS and 100 DHS for entrances, respectively. They claimed while these places are very beautiful, they are more than overpriced.

Agadir felt like a resort town, less historical (as the city was veyr destroyed by an earthquake), with construction sites alnost everywhere. Nevertheless, I've very much enjoyed the beach/port part of the city (very alive in the evening!), going to the mountain (Oufella) and watching the sunset from there, Medina (perhaps my favorite place) and CrocoParc (tbh I did not understand why do they have so many crocodiles - they are literally stacked on each other). Pricewise everything is significantly cheaper than Marrakech.

Finally, Essaouira is the smallest but just as interesting city - it has the most medieval vibe, beautiful narrow streets, fortress and nice port. However, expect quite some tourists there.

Despite being there in December, it was very warm - something like late spring in southern Europe. Marrakech does get quite cold in the night though.

Overall, a great experience and I certainly would recommend visiting the country once (at least these places). However, I doubt that I would go there for a second time. What I did not like were the amounts of trash (it is also hard to find trash cans), prices (also for relatively poor maintained hotels/hostels) and the social contrast - in Marakech you will see both Porsche cars and young girls begging/selling paper tissues while doing homework on tthe street.

Some small points:

Cash: few places accept card payment, so you will need cash. If your bank does not charge you comission foor withdrawals (like german DKB/ING), you can withdraw without comission and fees at the bank named Al Barid (post  bank). Other people also mentioned CDM Bank but I havent gotten the chance to try it. Supermarket chains (like Carrefour) and most hotels/hotels do accept cards though. If you want to buy anything at basars, do try to bargain, otherwise you will overpay by a lot.  

Language: few people understand English, so French and Arabic are more useful. The locals however are more than eager to try and communicate with gestures (or by typing numbers into calculator, when it comes to merchants), so not too problematic.

Safety: as a solo (male) traveler, I've felt very safe and welcomed most of time. Perhaps one place that I didnt like were the road crossings, where not all car drivers stop at zebras. There, you do have to gather courage and start walking (locals also show palm off the hand to stop cars. Overall, I felt safer than in some Asian countries). In Agardir there is plenty of police roaming and I've seen people leaving bags/children strollers alone at cafes while going to tthe toilet or to pay. Mind that many solo girl travelers do report harassment and cat calling. 

Food and drinks: amazing experience, especially fruits, tangine and tea. Note that if you are a (lacto-ovo) vegeterian as me, at most places you will be reduced to very few choices. Keep in mind that if you aim for couscous, many places offer it exclusively on Fridays. As for alcohol, most restaurants and bars do not serve it at all. Many places offer mocktails and funnily mojitos; the latter ones will be also non alcoholic. Few shops like Carrefour close their alcohol section at around 19/20 o'clock. For breakfst, most cafes serve very good meals (petit dejeuners), which are a good deal.

Obligatory note that English is not my first language, so my apologies for grammar mistakes. One of my reasons to write this post is to merely practise non scientific writing. 

I wish you all happy new Year! Feel free to ask me any questions.

The case is metal, and all the electrical components are three motors and one light. (Also a battery powered igniter—which is “grounded” to the case inside the panel.)

**Do I need to revise this wiring for safety?** I’m under the impression that appliances with a metal case need to be grounded properly.

I want to acknowledge this as a positive but I am unsure of the wisdom of acknowledging that I was in a negative place regarding our marriage a year ago

Basic backstory - married for almost 20 years, haven’t always been good at communicating. Marriage has been sexless for the past decade (four times in 10 years). Major life circumstances involved - childbirth, COVID, mental health challenges and past trauma for my wife.

At the end of 2023, I was feeling overwhelmed by all the mental load I was carrying in the marriage (majority of childcare, majority of household management, primary earner), as my wife was dealing with recovery from childhood trauma issues and professional burnout.

I started seeing a therapist at the very beginning of 2024. It’s helped me see understand some ways to both process this and to breakdown some of the communication barriers that were in our way.

At the same time, my wife’s recovery has been very real this year and she’s in a much better place. We’ve started having weekly coffee dates that have really improved our communication and emotional connection.

As this year has wrapped, I’ve also made a major mental shift in my approach to our relationship. I realized that I have spent so much time holding my expectations of what she wants and filtering my own actions through the lens of what she might think/hear. But with the help of my therapist,
I’ve started to realize that I need to let go of my instincts here and just be honest with her about my own wants and desires while also being OK with understanding that if we’re not on the same page, that’s OK and we can find a way to navigate the differences.

Sounds simple but it’s taken some work to get here!

Anyway, we’re going to find some time these next few days for us. I want to put my cards on the table and let her know the extent of my journey this year. I really feel much closer to her at the end of this year than I have in a long time. BUT I’m nervous that acknowledging that I was pretty unhappy a year ago may be a surprise to her and make her feel like it was her fault, which it really wasn’t - she has had enough to deal with.

A vital film of its time, a documentary standing witness to a small fraction of life’s bounty and what makes it tick. A good “with morning coffee” Mrs. Lady Zedd had rolling this morning. 

From IMDb: An overview of the changing world of nature, focusing on plants, bees, sea creatures, and volcanoes. Nature's strange and intricate methods of perpetuating life allow for species survival.

That said, we simply can’t continue using the Movie Algorithm Project (MAP) for documentaries - it’s only mildly applicable. MAP is simply wonderful for fishing out the enjoyment principles on regular films, but documentaries tell their stories in a very different way. For instance, there are questions about make-up and costuming… a documentary on bees and flowering plants doesn’t find themselves in need of such things. As such, scores go wild and need to be taken with a grain of salt. 

Maybe it’s time, as my pagan heart is contemplating what crops to plant in the coming year, to consider if I’ve learned enough with MAP to create a new beast. Perhaps with “crops” such as *fellowship*, *vitality*, and *increased awareness*, it’s time to create the Documentary Algorithm Project (DAP). Hmm, it could be. 

I wonder what you might be interested in creating for yourself and the lives around you? Fingers crossed you pick “hanging out with my cinematic siblings at 500 Movies” - how better to get your *movie on*… and maybe a *documentary* too. ",2,1735671688.0,500moviesorbust,0,1.0,False

For some, it’s the child marriages or the secret billions. For me, it was the Bishop’s interviews.

Starting at eight years old, I had to sit in a room and profess that I believed in Jesus and Joseph Smith. Thing is, I never did. I’m logical—no evidence, no belief. But I parroted the words anyway because that’s what got me approval.

My dad wasn’t around much, and in the 90s, the church basically outsourced fatherhood to Scouts and Young Men’s leaders. Their approval became everything to me, but it came with strings: I had to play the part. I didn’t realize it at the time, but it set me up to believe that my worth was conditional—that I wasn’t good enough on my own.

It took years of therapy to see it, but this year, for the first time in my 40s, I actually said, “I like myself.” And I meant it.

A week later, while visiting my parents, I ran into my old bishop. Right away, he was all smiles and invited me to lunch the next day. I thought, “Why not?” Maybe I’d get some closure.

At lunch, I brought up how much those interviews had messed with my self-esteem. His response? That soft, “I care about you” voice they use, while being a total asshole. He cut me off mid-sentence—not once, not twice, but three times—with lines like, “I refuse to accept that,” or, “I disagree.” Each time, it felt like he was dismissing not just my words but my entire experience.

On the drive home, I had a moment of clarity: **they never loved me.** And the thing is, that realization didn’t hurt. It was freeing. It was like finally seeing something for what it was and letting go of the hope that it could ever be anything else. I wasn’t sad—I was *done.*

They loved me like Trump loves his supporters—only as long as I played the role and supported the system. The moment I questioned or deviated, that love was gone. It wasn’t real; it was a long sales pitch.

I started thinking about my time in Young Men’s. We’d visit inactive members, offer prayers, do service—but it was always with one goal: getting them back to church. As soon as someone made it clear they weren’t coming back, weren’t quitting coffee, the service stopped. It was never just about helping people; it was always about the agenda.

And then I remembered my time as a stockbroker. Same story, different context. I’d go to clubs, meet people, get to know them, and care about them—sort of. But only as long as they were customers, giving referrals, or had the potential to be clients. No money, no referrals? Then no time for you.

And the worst part? It felt natural. I didn’t even question it. Looking back, I’m disgusted at how easy it was for me to operate that way.

Then, to top it all off, my old bishop texted me after lunch: “Thank you for lunch. I love you so much.”

I replied, “No, thank *you*. This lunch helped me more than you could ever know.”

My autism makes me depend more on my parents. I don’t have a drivers license (yet) and anything takes 30+ minutes to get to by walking in the Florida heat. My suburb has a lot of green but it’s the kind that doesn’t look natural and is planted in patters, adding to a lack of stimuli. The sidewalks are small and randomly end leading to nowhere. I’m in my late teens and have a younger sister (16) who can drive and goes to Miami (1 hour drive) with her friends to go to clubs. I don’t have friends or access to a vehicle like her so I tend to stay home most of the time. All activities in the city are done for Families and Kids ONLY. No activities for teens or young adults. The third spaces if there are any, are far from any kind of private community unless it’s by the richer parts of town. The ‘fun’ people my age have is hard drinking and drugs which I don’t take. Most kids here don’t even play outside unless they are below the age of 10. The neighbors keep to themselves. Most kids my age (1 by 8+) have moved out for college so I don’t have many people to talk with, not only that I barely have access to anything that isn’t a fast food chain. My sister praises the suburbs for its ‘safety’ but it’s not even safe as the roads are wide and we get kids who get run over every other month because of drunk teens driving out of boredom. Not only that more families are moving in and even taking over spaces people like me have been using to cope with the lack of them (mostly skate parks and coffee shops).

Working from home has not been enjoyable due to sciatica and arm pain. Not to mention gaining weight. So... new desk set up it is! Here are the changes that have added quality to my time working.

- I chose a flexispot 3 stage ergo desk. I'm 5'6 with short legs, so the ability to go down to 24.5"" was nessesary. The three stage dual motor desks also allow for extra height when elevated, if you are a tall person.

- a good chair. This is probably the most important. They are expensive, but well worth it for your health.


- the side laptop holder. This obviously is personal preference, but two screens are enough for me. Safely tucking away my laptop clears my desktop of clutter.

- under desk cable management. This is a complete game changer. If my surroundings are a mess, I am a mess. This tucks everything away from cords to my docking station. 

- a good sound system. Listening to music while working is good for my mental health and taking calls without a headset is much more convenient. I don't need to be a consistent active participant in many of my meetings, so the ability to walk around the room untethered is great.

- sounds silly, but wearing my indoor workout shoes has been very comfortable when the desk is set to stand.

Future add-ons in consideration 

- walking pad. Would be nice to hit 10,000 steps before the end of my work day.

- 7"" mini monitor below my current one to keep my calendar up. Gettingt lost in data is a thing, so the reminder would be great.

- mug warming pad. Coffee gets cold too fast!  

- a good heavy fidget toy.

Thank you all for your continued expertise and relaying your experience in these forums. I left active duty in 2014, after 20 years of active service, and was also given 80% disability by the VA at discharge (BDD). Part of that rating was MH at 50%. I am curious if I can add GERD and Gallbladder Removal (7318) as secondary to my MH rating? If so, does anyone have any personal experience in this area that would be beneficial to me as I go through this process?

I had my Gallbladder removed 6 years ago (with resulting inconsistent bowel movements, sorry). In addition, I've been on prescription medication such as pantoprazole and omeprazole since before discharge (continuously for over 10 years). As an example, my stomach ""growls"" and at the most inopportune times. I've got used to telling workgroups, etc. that I simply ""drank too much coffee.""

1hqleg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hqleg3/aitah_for_revealing_secrets_of_mutual_friends/,AITAH for revealing secrets of mutual friends that are now Ex’es.,"This is a long one; here we go. 

I (23M) revealed bits and pieces of my friend’s secret (we’ll call him “M”) to his now Ex (we’ll call her H).

It all started right after M and H broke up and they decided to reduce their contact and limit it to texting at max. I was one of the first to know about their break up and how it affected both of them as I was close to both sides. M used to keep himself busy with his work at Law school as it was his way of coping, but it didnt really work out much for H, who is a medical student(and so am I, thus how our friendship initially got closer).


H and I had a time period where we were studying for one of the biggest exams in med school, with a semester full of exams so you can imagine how stressful it was. She would have the attention span of like 15 mins and then zone out and tell me that she would like to go for a walk, coffee, etc. and during our break she would tell me how much she misses being in a relationship with M and how much its affected her. The issue is that this got so repetitive that it was affecting her studies and it showed, she was still fresh out of a break up but she had to somehow get her sh*t together or else she would fail the year.


I went and talked to M and told him what H told me about missing being with him, as well as telling him that I think that maybe, for the sake of her passing the semester at least, he should try to be there for her just for the time being as the presence of myself or any other person was just not enough, and well, he did and took the advice with not much of his own opinion said.



Some time passes by, H passed the semester with flying colors. M and H are still considered close and hang out every now and then but are strictly NOT in a relationship. H shared with me that she feels guilty about finding another man attractive, and since I was close to M at the time, he used to share how he found certain girls attractive. I told H that M doesn’t feel guilty about finding other women attractive, so I don’t think you should feel that way too and that you’re both just moving on. and I think that was where I made my first mistake. She asked me who does he find attractive. There were so many names I could’ve said but i decided to act like I was trying to recall a single name when I had atleast 3 in my mind. I gave her a name but I told her that he told me he won’t pursue anything with that person, and that the same external factors that led to the break up with H are also present in that girl, so he does not want to waste her time. (Which is the truth, he did state that and I made sure to mention it)

!!!QUICK NOTE BEFORE MOVING ON!!!
M and H broke up not because they fell out of love, but there were more cultural factors that just made it impossible for them to be together and would both face extreme backlash from their families due to “betraying their traditions”.


Anyways, 

A few weeks after that conversation, they both out decided to meet up and H told him that she heard that he finds that certain girl attractive. M asked where she got the information from and she told him that I was the one that told her. She didnt provide any further context on why I said that. M then obviously told her that I told him that she misses him and misses being his girlfriend a few months ago. M then called me and told me that he is extremely angry that I told H and himself what they have trusted me as a friend to keep in secret and I 100% understood why he was upset, and I told him that I’d like to talk in person and explain why I said what I said. He did not want to call nor talk. Non of it.


The same day we called on the phone and I told him that I was very sorry, and that I did not mean to ignite a fire it was never my intention. I told him that I mentioned the girl not because it was “tea to spill”, there was context to it and that was when i figured out the information H provided to M was missing the whole point of why I said what I said about him finding another girl attractive. He asked me to provide him with the context and I told instead of adding fuel to the fire go ask H to tell you if she’s comfortable doing so. She told him and then proceeded to call me and told me that she thinks im a good person but she did not want her feelings at the time to be shared with the one person she didnt want to know. She also told me that I left her with no choice but to tell him that she found a certain person attractive.

We grew very distant lately as M went to one of my closest friends to talk behind my back and obv that friend told me. I feel the tension between us but it has died down and I hate to keep any sort of resentment to a certain person as it eats me up.

AITAH, and whether I am or not, do you think I should talk to M and H and try to fix things?

**Sammamish City Council Approves 1% Property Tax Increase for 2025:** On November 25, the Sammamish City Council unanimously voted to implement a 1% property tax levy increase, the maximum allowable under Washington state law. The increase will generate $302,446 to support city operations and will cost the median homeowner approximately $11 more annually, raising the total to $1,543 for a property valued at $1.4 million. Despite the tax hike, the city’s levy rate will decrease by 12 cents per $1,000 due to a 12.3% rise in assessed property values. Sammamish retains 14% of property taxes collected, with the remainder distributed to schools, King County, and other districts.

Some nights i feel like a leftover crumb from a dinner party nobody invited me to. New Year’s Eve, 7:03 p.m., fireworks are tearing open the sky scaring the shit out of birds and I’m in my kitchen whisking cocoa powder. Why a chocolate cake? Maybe because it's cheaper than therapy  and I can conjure it without leaving home or calling someone who will inevitably ask me if I’m okay. (I’m not, but we know that’s a rhetorical question) The batter clings to the spoon and it's all brown and sludgy from a weird mix of eggs coffee and oil, maybe this is what sadness looks like. Meanwhile, I’ve got Prosecco chilling in the fridge because, apparently, I enjoy lying to myself that I’ll make this a celebration when I know I'll just listen to white girl music and cry at 2am again. I slide the cake into the oven. The clock ticks. What if I over cook it and now I've wasted too much money on ingredients I'll never use again. Oh hello reflection in the oven door, fuck you. Does it matter if I ring in the new year alone? Does the year even care? The fireworks get louder. Twelve strokes later, my neighbors scream “Happy New Year!” in unison, a chorus of drunken chants like anything has changed. I hold up my Prosecco glass to no one in particular, then ask the kitchen wall, if I blow out the candles on a chocolate cake in an empty room, do I still get a wish? And if so, can I wish for a new body, or a new mind, or at least a new set of instructions on how to keep going?

The oven dings. Outside, fireworks fade into distant pops like the last sputters of an old engine. I retrieve my midnight masterpiece: cracked at the edges, slightly deflated in the middle, but still rich enough to fool my taste buds for a couple of mouthfuls. I pour the Prosecco into a chipped mug because fancy flutes are for people who have dinner guests. Then I take a bite. I swallow. *I’m still here.* Blood pumping, lungs squeaking and still in pain, brain doing that thing where it pretends to be normal but keeps asking me if I left the stove on or locked the door or made every disastrous mistake possible along the way. Yes? No? Possibly all of the above. *Is it sad?* Sure. But maybe sadness is just the default setting we pretend not to notice when people ask how we are. I toss back another gulp of happiness grape juice that tastes like man tears with cheap grapes. The fireworks have fizzled out, but the year is just waking up, rubbing the sleep from its eyes, asking if I’m ready to face it. Am I? Who knows. Maybe I’m waiting for a lightning bolt of clarity, or a hug from some oblivious deity that will shrink my ribcage or just a better recipe that doesn’t involve tears as salt. Because if life insists on being complicated, I’ll meet it head-on with chocolate icing ......or suicide, I guess.",5,1735671163.0,4tran4,1,1.0,False

We met up one of those days and it was great - sat for 3 hours in a coffee shop and just chatted it up. My bday is coming up and we planned on having a ski trip. Yesterday I was about to book it but she asked if we could wait. She said “she’s been in her head a lot” and that she isn’t sure if my friends or even I truly like her. Mind you - I’m crazy about her and my friends thought she was great. She asked if we could take things slower. I’m all about that but if she’s having these thoughts I want to show her how much I care about her. I’m just confused - I don’t want to lose her.",1,1735670918.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

his regional accent is drastically different from mine and i love to listen to him talk and the way he pronounces words so now before we go to bed every night, he reads to me so i can just relax and listen to him read stories. 

he brings me flowers from Trader Joe’s when the old ones die because the empty vase “makes him sad”. he’s never even been to a Trader Joe’s before but I told him I liked going there so now he stops by there on his way home from work to pick a bouquet. I’ve never even received flowers before but it’s like every week he brings new ones home. 

he makes me a cup of coffee in the morning and leaves it on my bedside table for when i wake up so i can drink my coffee in bed.
also, he won’t let me get out of bed in the morning to feed the dog or take her out at 5am, he always tells me to stay in bed and he’ll do it. 

anytime i thank him for something like getting me breakfast or a coffee when we’re out he thanks me back for “being amazing”. even when i didn’t even do anything 

he always lets me take the middle spot on the couch so i can cuddle our dog even though i know he wants to cuddle the dog too. she was his dog first. 

he stopped drinking almond milk because I’m allergic even though he loves it. i told him it was okay as long as he rinses his mouth out but he said i’m more important than almond milk.

Lucien Graft floated aimlessly through an empty void. Memories danced at the edges of his consciousness, hazy and surreal.

Where am I? How did I get here? Is this a dream?

His life flashed before him—not as a montage of triumphs, but a dreary sequence of long office hours, cold takeout dinners, and the faint hum of fluorescent lights. No friends to call his own, no family beyond his mother, whose memories had long been claimed by her illness. His existence had been an endless loop of monotony.

That’s right… God, my life sucks. Maybe this is some kind of stress dream?

The thought brought the last memory into focus. He was at his desk, staring blankly at the clock, counting down the hours until another wasted day was over. A yawn, a stretch, a knock of his elbow—then the lukewarm coffee spilled across his desk, dripping into the exposed power strip below. A spark. A flash. Pain so fleeting he barely registered it.

Wait… am I dead? From a crappy cup of office coffee? Really?!

A voice answered, interrupting his spiraling thoughts.

“Yep. Dead as a doornail. Sorry about that.”

Lucien spun, or at least he felt like he did—there was no ground, no body. Before him materialized a man seated on a grand marble throne. His attire was… odd. A blend of gaudy and regal, like a businessman who’d won the lottery and couldn’t decide between power or flair. The throne was surrounded by an endless expanse of clouds and a fading sunset that didn’t seem to belong to any particular horizon.

“Who—what—are you?” Lucien stammered.

The man smirked, leaning forward. “I am Lulutera. A god, as you mortals call us. And… well, I hate to admit it, but your untimely death was my bad.”

“Your bad?! I died because of you?!”

Lulutera raised a hand to cut him off. “Look, I said I was sorry. It was an accident—honestly, I thought the fire suppression in that office was better. Humans and their safety codes…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “Anyway! I’m here to make it up to you.”

Lucien folded his arms, skeptical. “And how exactly do you plan to fix this?”

“Well, I can’t send you back—your body’s… well, let’s not dwell on that. But I can offer you a new life. A better one, in a new world! Think of it as… reincarnation, with perks.”

Lucien stared, his disbelief mounting. “I had a life, you know. A crappy one, sure, but it was mine.”

“Did you, though? No friends, no real family to miss you—and you hated your job. I’m doing you a favor here. So what’ll it be? Rebirth, or the afterlife? I warn you, limbo’s a bit crowded these days.”

Damn, he’s not wrong. Lucien exhaled sharply. “Fine. I’ll bite. What’s the catch?”

“No catch!” Lulutera snapped his fingers, and a massive spinning wheel appeared, filled with thousands of cryptic symbols and images. “Just spin the Wheel of Reincarnation to find your new form. I’ll even throw in a blessing. Go on, give it a whirl.”

Lucien looked from the wheel to Lulutera and back again, his annoyance bubbling. “This is a joke, right?”

“Do I look like I joke?” Lulutera replied, deadpan, though the faint smirk undermined his words.

Reluctantly, Lucien stepped forward and spun the wheel. It turned for what felt like an eternity, Lulutera humming a jaunty tune as it clicked past options like “Moss Sprite,” “Stone Golem,” and “Royal Griffin.” Finally, the wheel slowed, its pointer settling on an image of a dark, flaming bird.

“Whoa!” Lulutera exclaimed, clapping his hands. “You’ve hit the jackpot! The legendary Ebonflame Phoenix. Not only are you the first of your kind, but you’re also bound to shake things up in your new world. They’ll never see you coming.”

“A phoenix? Seriously?” Lucien grimaced. “Can’t you make me human or something?”

“Boring! Besides, this body has so much potential. Trust me, you’ll thank me later.” Lulutera snapped his fingers again. The ground beneath Lucien vanished, sending him plummeting toward an endless sky.

“Wait! What about my blessing—?!” His scream was cut off as black flames engulfed him, reshaping his body into a fiery egg, solidified in a cocoon of smoldering ash.

The New World

The village of Ardentwood had known peace for generations, nestled in the shadow of the Emberstone Mountains. But in recent months, the winds carried whispers of unease. Monsters grew bold, attacking in waves that even seasoned adventurers struggled to repel. The skies seemed darker, the forests quieter—a foreboding stillness that set even the most stoic farmers on edge.

It was on one such uneasy evening that a fiery streak tore across the heavens, crashing into a field just outside the village. Farmers gathered warily, weapons in hand, only to find a smoldering crater—and within it, a blackened, glowing egg, pulsing with an ominous warmth.

Word spread quickly. Some whispered it was a blessing, others a curse. But one thing was certain: the world would never be the same.

(I've decided to try a new idea that I've been kicking around for a bit. Obviously, it's an isekai. I've never done one before, and certainly never played as a creature before so I'm definitely excited to see how this plays out. I will say that there will be mechanics in place later on in the story to allow my character to take on a humanoid form, and I plan on having that implemented fairly quickly but there's going to be a period where our characters won't be able to talk to escorts beyond body language. So that should be fun. 

This should start off fairly light-hearted as you'll be able to see, but there is some serious notes that will manager later on as the story progresses. This is gonna be 1x1 but I would like to take this off Reddit in favor of a somewhat more organized platform which we can discuss later. Finally, I do have some minor questions and requests which we can discuss later. I doubt any of them will be any issue for anyone)

I don't have grinder, I was intending to use good grinded coffee. So I started with what I had - Dallmayr Classic. First espresso shot after cleaning, pushing whole liter of clean water through... It was so sour I couldn't drink it, like I added lemon juice to my coffee.

I bought different coffee, somewhat recommended - Lavazza Espresso Italiano. First shot - still sour, but not as much. I used 10 g of coffee and tamped it real good. 

Then I tried lowering amount of coffee to 7 g. Definetly a bit better, but when I took out portafilter I saw that the grounds were just flowing - muddy and full of water, instead of nice, packed puck.

Went up a gram - to 8 g - and shot once again is pretty sour, but puck was a bit tighter (still not tightly packed, but better.

But I noticed something. The single shot basket is somewhat tapered, which CAN prevent me from good tamping at lower volumes, like 6-7 g, but when I use more grounds - like 8-10 g - I can see that the water outlet is literally stamped on top of the grounds. 

The single-shot basket is advertised as 10 g capacity, double-shot as 17 g. Both are 51 mm in diameter. Should I maybe use the bigger basket, even for single espresso shot? How much coffee is good?

So to the conclusion - I just can't do it, the coffee is bad, or the machine is just borked?

She was 13 at the time of this story, and about to turn 14. I had gotten her a high-end phone, and my parents got her a low-end-low-cost phone. My parents scolded me when they learned I got her a higher end phone, and my sister defended me, saying this was why my older brother left the house. My parents knew they wouldn't be able to win her over, so they got a few beers and went to bed. She gave me half of her birthday money. Tomorrow, I went to work, and on the way I got a call from my boss, telling me to meet him in his office. He had given me a promotion to the head engineer, telling me I deserved it. Now my income had went from 135$/h to a whopping 255$/h. I had been doing overtime that night, and the coffee machine was refilled around 4-11 times an hour. I worked a total of what felt like two days, and made around 5,355 that night. I went back home to find my room ransacked and my credit card gone, and then I immediately asked my sister what happened, and she said that our parents had stolen my credit card and were spending all of it Willy nilly on stuff like a cotton candy machine and a large popcorn popper as ""late gifts"" for my sister. I called the cops, and got my parents into court. Their lawyer was more slack than mine was slick, and I ended up suing them for it. Eventually, next week, I had enough to buy the apartment. It was for me and my sister only. My parents ended up following us and entering the apartment without our permission, but we let it go. Everything was fine for a few days until my parents decided to get drunk and trash the place. I was not letting that slide, and I called to get them evicted, but they found a way to sneak into the apartment again. This time, they DESTROYED our Television and we called the cops. They went to jail for a while and had to do community service for a whopping 2.36 years. So am I the jerk for kicking them out of my penthouse apartment?",3,1735669899.0,AmITheJerk,12,0.55,False

***Solar Wind Guide***

**Dramatis Personae (Crew of the** ***Choushinsai*****):**

*Katsuro Hara -* Commanding officer of UNSS *Amatsukaze* and later UNSS *Choushinsai*. A career officer of the Imperial Japanese division of the UN Space Navy, Hara prides himself on strict but fair discipline and training his crew. This has made his ships some of the most efficient in the UN and earned him command of one of the first FTL capable warships. As a senior captain and low-level flag officer, Hara is frequently given command of other units as squadron leader.  

*Azrael Sapir* – Weapons officer of UNSS Amatsukaze, known for her aggressive tactics and precise aim. A member of the Israeli division of the UN Space Navy, she comes from a military family, with both her father and older brother serving with honors. Azrael is the lover of Wilhelm Ehrickle. After the Battle of Earth, she is promoted to be Hara’s first officer.

*Wilhelm Ehrickle* – Chief engineer serving under Hara, notable for his terrible accent love of machines. Wilhelm is Azrael’s other half, though she sometimes wonders if he loves his ship’s engines more. While a competent officer, Wilhelm has no ambition to command an entire ship, let alone a task group, preferring the intimacy of direct contact with a small number of crew.

*Sipha* – Space-Ven assistant engineer under Wilhelm. Sipha shares his love of machines, but she also harbors a desire to learn more about the people around her. She is fascinated by the idea of inter-species herds, noting how the inclusion of both predator and prey elements provides a stronger collective, much like alloying metals. As with all engineers, she shares a love of coffee, even recognizing different blends and beans by taste.

*Suren* – Venlil navigator, he was part of a crew rescued by *Amatsukazi* during the evacuation of Cradle. Young and eager to learn, Suren benefits from Hara’s steady leadership, as well as the mentorship of his lead non-commissioned officer, Chief Martin Samuels.

*Martin Samuels* – Assistant navigator, and navy “lifer”. Samuels has been in the navy for longer than some of the *Choushinsai* officers have been alive. He acts as a father to several crew members, including Ensign Suren. In typical American fashion, Samuels has an awful diet.

*Johnathan Hopkins* – Communications officer of *Choushinsai*, and ONI operative. His status as an intelligence operative is an open secret which all the crew know, but no one ever presses him on. Due to injuries sustained at the battle of Sillas, Johnathan has extensive prosthetics, including both legs below the knees and the entirety of his left arm. He is good friends with Hara, formerly serving as his steward before his ONI status was revealed.

**Dramatis Personae (Marines of the** ***Choushinsai*****):**

*Jason Lee* – Gunnery Sergeant, and leader of the marine division. Known simply as “Gunny”, Sergeant Lee is another “lifer” with immense experience. He is a marine among marines and takes no nonsense from anyone under his command. Lee has a friendly rivalry with Chief Samuels, with the two often trading “insults” in their off hours.

*Flavia* – Venlil Sergeant, leads a small fireteam consisting of herself, Corporal Franklin, K-9 Moro, and Private Zazo. Flavia is in a unique position of being a herbivore in command of multiple predators but has earned the respect of her team through displays of skill and fearless dedication to the art of war. There is no doubt that federation exterminators would consider her “predator diseased”, and she even wonders this herself due to her growing bonds with Franklin and Zazo.

*Douglas Franklin* – member of Fire Team Flavia, and handler of K-9 Moro. Corporal Franklin’s diet is somehow even worse than Chief Samuel’s, but he keeps in shape due to the demands of being a marine.

*Zazo* – Private “Komodo” Zazo is a former adversary, captured at the battle of Sillas. His assignment is highly experimental, but for the time being has been successful. Zazo is very motivated by the “nicer” things in life: a full belly, a warm sleep space, and praise from his superiors. Has a growing bond with fellow predator, K-9 Moro.

*Moro* – K-9 fur-missile. Woof Woof! SNARL!

=====

**Dramatis Personae (Supporting Cast):**

*Edward Evans* – Former first officer of *Amatsukazi,* now commands UNSS *Samuel B. Roberts*

*Lei Xaoling* – Former commissary officer of *Amatsukazi*. Now serves as Edward Evan’s executive officer.

*James Dawson* – Captain of UNSS *Christian*, missing in action

*Richard Ulrich –* Commander of UNSS Dauntless and CruDes1. Promoted to command Battle Group Toronto.

Lee Hosogawa – Commander of Battle Group Tokyo.

=====

**Dramatis Personae (Villains):**

*Diane Marconi* – Former communications officer of Amatsukazi. Was executed for involvement with Humanity First and leading a mutiny against Hara.

[https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9](https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9)

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

* ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 cup beef broth (236ml)
* ¼ cup ham bone broth (59ml)
* 1 cup espresso or strong black coffee (236ml)

Instructions

1. Chop onions and jalapenos, combine, and set aside. Chop garlic and set aside. Prepare dry spice mix detailed in step 4, mix together thoroughly, and set aside. Crumble/process tortilla chips and set aside. Open all the cans you’ll be using in step 5, drain beans in can with mostly opened lid, and set aside. Combine other liquids plus peanut butter from step 5, chop dry peppers and add to liquid mix, and set aside. 
2. Place chopped (uncooked) bacon in a large pot or Dutch oven and cook over medium heat until crisp and cooked through. Remove bacon to a paper towel lined plate and drain half the grease.
3. Add onion and jalapenos, stir quickly, and undercook them (thanks Kevin) for just one minute..
4. Add garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add beef, breaking apart with a spatula as you cook. Once meat is partially (about 50%) browned, add ground chips and prepared dry spice mix (brown sugar, chili powders, paprika, cumin, onion powder, mexican oregano, cocoa powder, black pepper, cinnamon, salt, MSG, curry, cayenne pepper) and stir well, cook for about two more minutes.
5. Add all remaining ingredients — liquid mix with dried peppers (beef broth, ham bone broth, espresso, fish sauce, peanut butter, Worcestershire sauce, ACV, chopped dried peppers), canned ingredients (both beans, tomatoes, tomato paste, both chilis), and your cooked bacon (and optional cubed roast), and stir well.
6. Bring to a boil and cook 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently.
Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally. Simmer for 30 minutes, allow the flavors to really get to know each other in the pot. 
7. For best results, let cool and refrigerate overnight. Warm back up the next day and serve. 
8. Serve with preferred toppings (sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, and corn chips are a must!)",98,1735669809.0,Cooking,62,0.9,False
1hqktu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1hqktu2/found_a_special_mug_that_my_dead_mother_gave_me/,Found a special mug that my dead mother gave me just trashed and dirty in my brother’s car. ,"Ok so I’m considering my brother a roommate in this scenario cause we sure as hell aint family with how he be acting like wolves raised him. 

So we’re currently getting some construction done on our house and this morning my Grandmom called me and asked if I could move my brothers car so the construction people can get in. 

I hate getting in his car .. it’s absolutely filthy I didn’t even want to get in it. So I tried to wake him up to tell him to do it and he’s refusing. So I sigh and go do it and I find MY CUP that our Mother, who has passed, just on the ground all dirty and bent up. It was seriously filthy and looked like it had been left in his car for weeks. I’m currently not working and since it’s a to-go cup for coffee I haven’t needed to use it so I didn’t notice it was gone.  

I’m just pissed! I have asked SO MANY TIMES for my stuff not to get used or touched and he doesn’t listen. And now a GIFT from our mother is gross and I would never want to put my mouth to that cup ever again. 

He ruins all of our cups/mugs and will start a whole science project in his room with it. He has ADHD so he struggles to remember putting it in the dishwasher when finished using it but my GOD that whole statement is getting old because so the fuck do I and my cups make it to the goddamn dishwasher when I’m done with them.


It’s just sooooooo exhausting and mentally draining to ask someone not to touch your shit several fucking times and they don’t listen.

No, I don’t want to put my belongings in my room or lock it up - thats so ridiculous - people need to just be respectful. Cups are like $7 at fucking Walmart please go invest in one for yourself. I’m just over the disrespect constantly. Also should mention the kid doesn’t even drink coffee so why the actual fuck are you using *my coffee cup*? 

How does anyone deal with this?! Why are people so god damn inconsiderate with other’s belongings?! ",27,1735669765.0,badroommates,27,0.92,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hqkr7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/goodsteward/comments/1hqkr7d/good_steward_2024_yearend_review/,Good Steward 2024 Year-end Review,"Hey everyone! 👋

*Many of you will have seen this in our year-end email newsletter, but I wanted to post it here in our subreddit as well, for all those who might not have seen it yet, and for those who might stumble upon this at a future time!*

As we approach the end of 2024 and as I reflect upon all that's taken place, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for being a part of our awesome community. 2024 has been an incredible 1st year for Good Steward, and we couldn’t have done it without your support. Thank you for being a part of our journey, and for allowing us to be a part of yours!

# Year end review 🔍 

As we wrap up this year, and look forward to the next year ahead, the word “Journey” is particularly meaningful to me. I plan to write out a more detailed version for those who are interested in all of the back stories in a future blog post. But for now, for sake of time (I’m sure you all want to go back to your holiday festivities), here’s a list of our progress in ***growing from nothing into something***! 

**Jan 2024** – Ideation, requirements gathering, and started coding… but we didn’t officially exist yet.  
**Feb 2024** – Settled on “Good Steward” as our name, started Discord server, initial product prototype deployed.  
**Mar 2024** – Official public launch of Good Steward with the free version of our app.  
**Apr 2024** – Applied for YC S24 batch (didn’t get in), resolved to fully bootstrap, released “Schedules” feature.  
**May 2024** – Bank sync development underway + released a ton of updates and reporting enhancements.  
**Jun 2024** – Bank sync + Device sync entered user testing.  
**July 2024** – Public launch of Paid Tier with Bank Sync + Device Sync.  
**Aug 2024** – Welcomed the first batch of paid users to our community!  
**Sep 2024** – Released Off-budget categories + enhancements to Linked Accounts, Investments & Loans.  
**Oct 2024** – Started financial training sessions to help others with budgeting and finances.  
**Nov 2024** – Finicity integration + Automatic categorization & budget generation entered testing.  
**Dec 2024** – 2 of our trainees successfully removed their consumer debt ahead of schedule!

# Looking ahead 👀 

Going into 2025, our mission and philosophy remain the same: **making budgeting easy and accessible to everyone, so that our community can grow together to become more purposeful, joyful, and productive in managing our finances.** We went from none existent to having a growing community of early adopters who love our product and are bought into our vision. And by listening to your feedback, supporting your needs, and answering your questions, we shipped some great features to make sure Good Steward stays in your corner and keeps working for you! 

So, looking ahead, here are some of the things we’ve been working on, and are hoping to share with you in the near future: 

**Coming soon: Finicity Integration 🔗🧩**  
  
Sorry folks, we know this is much later than we had hoped. There have been a lot of unexpected delays in the last mile on this one. But with some of the final legal stuff out of the way, we are hopeful to make Finicity Beta available in Production in January 2025. It will bring another major 3rd party aggregator to our users (there are more coming in the pipeline as well), which we expect to significantly contribute to both better coverage of financial institutions and higher quality of connections. Stay tuned for our announcements in the new year for the Finicity Beta Release! 

**AI powered auto-onboarding, categorization, and budget generation 🤖⚙️**  
  
While we believe Good Steward has all of the tools to make budgeting and managing your finances easy and productive, we also realize that for many users the initial setup and the number of options available can be overwhelming.  

So with that in mind, and to help folks get started on their budgeting more easily, we’ve been working on automating onboarding and transaction categorization using AI for a while. Our ultimate goal is to allow users to be able to sign-up for the app, and simply link to the bank accounts they want to connect to, and then just go get a coffee, and let our system work to sync all your transactions and figure out their categories. So that when you get back, voila, you get a budget already created for you based on your actual historical data.  

We think this is a powerful tool and flow to ease the pain of getting started, especially for folks who don’t feel like they have a good handle on their finances or don’t know where to start. Meanwhile, if you are a power user who knows exactly what you are doing, don’t worry, all of the existing comprehensive functionality that allows you to have fine grained control over every aspect of your budget will still all be there. 

We hope to push out an early beta version of this early in Q1. So keep an eye out on our updates in the next month or 2!

 **Other things stewing on the fire 🍲🔥**

We have a number of other exciting developments that are also under way, such as Receipts, Goals, and other advanced features to help you build healthy financial habits. Needless to say, we have a full roadmap and an exciting year planned for 2025, and we can’t wait to share these with you as things progress throughout the year.

# We need your help! 🤝 

I’ve talked to a lot of our users over the course of 2024, and besides the standard support to help resolve issues, and many fun banters that I've very much enjoyed, one of the most commonly asked questions has been “how can I help?”

 So as we turn a new page toward 2025, I want to list off a few things that our users can help with:

1. **Keep giving us feedback** – There’s nothing that helps us improve more than giving us your honest and constructive feedback. Please keep sharing those with us!
2. **Keep spreading the word** – In order for us to grow in our reach, people have to hear about us. One of the things we need most in 2025 will be increased exposure. Since we are fully bootstrapped, we don’t really spend much on marketing or ads. We rely mainly on word of mouth and organic growth. So if you enjoy using our app, if you get value from our service, if you believe in our vision, if you’ve benefited from our financial training, please help spread the word and tell others about us!
3. **Keep being an awesome community** – As we grow, our community will increasingly become the most important part of Good Steward, because community is one of the main pillars in successful financial transformation. So we need your help to foster a kind, supportive, and generous user community. Whether that means offering to help others in our Discord channels, or validation and encouragement in Reddit discussions, or perhaps even more substantial involvement in community building, we would love to see more engagement from you, our users, as we build this together!

# Thank you for an amazing year! ✨

For now, before we dive into the hustle of 2025, let’s all take a pause to chill, rest, and enjoy this holiday season, whether you are enjoying your Christmas presents, watching movies, shoveling snow (that’d be me…), or sleeping in, or just generally kicking back to appreciate this season and the year it’s been.

Huge thanks to all of you for trying us out and sticking with us. We appreciate every single one of you. 

🎉 Happy New Year, as we enter an exciting 2025 together! **Stay Awesome! 🤘**

I still don't understand Jerry's reasoning in this episode, what did in see in her to warrant this decision? All she did was say she was gonna scratch Jerry with her nails, I guess it was her gumption and bold attitude but he doesn't know anything about her. He doesn't know if she'd be strong or clever enough for such a dangerous job like this. I know it's a kid's show and you shouldn't think too hard on them but to be honest, I don't really care about that. I like overanalyzing things I'm into, it's how I enjoy stuff. Back to my point if you don't mind, Jerry shouldn't have endangered her by making an inexperienced kid like her a spy with seemingly zero training. At least Sam, Alex, and Clover were taught how to be spies in the prequel movie before he sent them on their first mission. I don't wanna only ever hate on Jerry because he's a pretty nice guy despite his flaws. He's mostly a good mentor for the girls and has positive moments like any other character.

They said I should schedule a in person session before I go. Or if it's not possible, even something like grab a coffee, because they thought the physical presence once in a while is something important either way.
For what I've seen in this sub, this would be a weird thing to do. But they might be a bit unconventional... we're just people I mean what's the big deal. The rules around here might be different, wouldn't know, not US nor UK.
Of course the transference once overcome came back like a phoenix.

Actually also also, they disclosed some personal info about their life and difficulties, when we were discussing the transference I revealed of feeling rejected by them over some minor inconveniences in sessions, so they went on to justify why those happened with a bit what's going on with them, and also validated my feelings and went for the source. I thought it was a bit too much maybe, their self disclosure.

Talking transference is tough, but it is awesome once you do it - for those trying for the first time.

I will be talking about what I've felt with this invite next session, and that I feel it might be worse being this close when they look some much alike another person in my life and I might be projecting.

We should meet up in public before deciding if we are comfortable with each other and agreeing to cuddle. Maybe we can meet for coffee, in a park or I am open to other ideas.
