We’d been exchanging glances for months, but only really spoke at our college picnic when we swapped photos about 4 months ago. Our conversation warmed from casual chat to subtle flirting and then outright playful banter. At the farewell party, we even danced together — I was the lone junior among outgoing seniors. We’d talked about meeting for coffee (date not yet scheduled) and had even joked about kissing. We were totally flirting with each other.

This morning she messaged to say she was going out with her family (including her elder brothers) to an outing and would ping me later this evening. I thought nothing of it… until I discovered she’d blocked me on WhatsApp (where we primarily chatted) and Snapchat (where we exchanged pics occasionally). 

I’ve spent the whole day feeling blindsided, embarrassed, and depressed. I can’t fathom why she’d cut off all contact so suddenly when everything seemed to be going well.

Has anyone else been through a situation like this? How do I process the shock of being blocked by someone I genuinely liked and thought liked me back?

TL;DR : M24 junior and F25 senior flirted for 3-4 months—danced, planned a coffee date, even talked about kissing—then she abruptly blocked me today, leaving me confused and devastated. ",1,1747311689.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I am not the type of person that loves multiple messages from men, I hate it, I rather focus on one or two and see where it leads.

[https://www.plantedshack.com/15-small-living-room-ideas-for-a-cozy-spacious-feel/](https://www.plantedshack.com/15-small-living-room-ideas-for-a-cozy-spacious-feel/)

  
Creating a cozy yet spacious living room can be a challenge, especially in smaller homes. However, with some clever design choices and thoughtful decor, you can transform a compact space into a welcoming and stylish retreat. In this article, we will explore 15 small living room ideas that will help you maximize your space while ensuring comfort and coziness.

  
1. Use Light Colors for Walls and Furniture

  
One of the simplest ways to make a small living room feel larger is to use light colors on the walls and furniture. Light shades create an airy atmosphere and reflect more natural light, making the space feel brighter and more open.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Choose soft neutrals like whites, creams, or pastels for your wall color.

  
– Opt for a light-colored sofa or chairs to complement the walls.

  
– Add colorful accents through pillows, throws, or artwork for contrast.

  
2. Incorporate Multi-Functional Furniture

  
In small living spaces, furniture that serves multiple purposes is a game-changer. Look for pieces that can be used in different ways, helping you maximize utility without overcrowding.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Choose a coffee table that opens up for storage.

  
– Invest in a sofa bed for guests or a futon for additional seating.

  
– Use ottomans instead of traditional seating that can double as storage.

  
3. Create an Open Layout

  
Keeping a visual flow throughout your small living room is crucial for creating the illusion of more space. An open layout allows for easier movement and a more expansive feel.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Arrange furniture to create a natural pathway.

  
– Avoid bulky, heavy pieces; select lightweight furniture that can be easily moved.

  
– Keep the center of the room open to facilitate movement.

  
4. Utilize Vertical Space

  
When floor space is limited, turn your eyes upwards! Utilizing vertical space not only helps keep the living room organized but also draws the eye upward, making the room feel taller.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Install shelves high on the walls to display books or decor.

  
– Use tall bookshelves that reach the ceiling.

  
– Hang artwork or mirrors higher than eye level to create the illusion of height.

  
5. Add Mirrors

  
Mirrors are a designer’s secret weapon when it comes to enhancing small spaces. They reflect light and can create the illusion of depth and dimension.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Hang a large mirror across from a window to reflect natural light.

  
– Use decorative mirrors in various shapes to add interest.

  
– Position mirrors behind lamps or on furniture to create depth.

  
6. Choose the Right Lighting

  
Good lighting is essential in a small living room. It not only illuminates the space but also sets the mood and makes the area feel more inviting.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Use layered lighting with a mixture of ambient, task, and accent lights.

  
– Choose sleek floor lamps or wall sconces to save floor space.

  
– Opt for dimmer switches to control the intensity of the light.

  
7. Create Zones with Rugs

  
Area rugs can define specific areas within a small living room, contributing to a structured yet inviting atmosphere. They help to separate spaces, making the room feel larger and more organized.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Place a rug under the main seating area to anchor the space.

  
– Use different rugs to indicate various functions, like a reading nook or play area.

  
– Choose rugs with light colors or patterns that don’t overwhelm the space.

  
8. Incorporate Natural Elements

  
Bringing the outside in can enhance your living room’s comfort. Natural elements like plants and wood can create a soothing and organic environment.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Add potted plants or hanging planters for a splash of greenery.

  
– Choose wooden furniture for warmth and texture.

  
– Use natural fabrics like cotton or linen for cushions and throws.

  
9. Keep it Clutter-Free

  
A cluttered room can quickly feel cramped and chaotic. Having a clean and organized living room will foster a cozy and spacious atmosphere.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Regularly declutter, removing items that no longer serve a purpose.

  
– Use decorative baskets or boxes for storage.

  
– Limit decorative items on surfaces to avoid a crowded look.

  
10. Use Floating Shelves

  
Floating shelves provide storage without taking up floor space. They are a stylish way to display books, photos, and collectibles while maintaining an open feel.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Install floating shelves above the sofa or in corners.

  
– Keep items arranged by color or size for a cohesive look.

  
– Avoid overcrowding shelves; leave some empty space for a clean appearance.

  
11. Opt for Transparent Furniture

  
Transparent furniture, like acrylic tables or glass chairs, creates a light and airy vibe, providing functionality without visual weight.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Choose a transparent coffee table to enhance flow.

  
– Incorporate ghost chairs around a dining table for versatility.

  
– Limit the use of heavy, solid pieces to avoid making the space feel cramped.

  
12. Use Built-In Storage Solutions

  
Built-in storage can beautifully maximize space and keep items organized while preventing clutter.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Create custom built-ins around the television for a cohesive look.

  
– Use shelving units that fit snugly into corners or walls.

  
– Consider window seats with storage underneath for a cozy nook.

  
13. Add Cozy Textiles

  
Soft textiles add warmth and comfort to your small living room. Think throw blankets, pillows, and textured rugs that invite relaxation.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Layer different textures, like a wool throw over a cotton couch.

  
– Mix and match throw pillows to create a cozy seating area.

  
– Utilize soft rugs underfoot to enhance comfort.

  
14. Embrace Minimalism

  
Sometimes, less is more. Adopting a minimalist approach can eliminate visual clutter and make a small living room feel more expansive and serene.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Limit decoration to essential pieces that bring you joy.

  
– Choose simple, functional furniture with clean lines.

  
– Create a cohesive color palette for a streamlined appearance.

  
15. Personalize with Artwork

  
Art can make a small living space feel unique and personal. Choosing the right pieces will add character without overwhelming the space.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Select a statement piece to hang above the sofa or fireplace.

  
– Use smaller framed pieces in a gallery wall to draw attention.

  
– Consider art that incorporates light colors to keep the room feeling open.

  
Conclusion

  
Transforming your small living room into a cozy and spacious haven is all about making thoughtful design choices. By incorporating light colors, multi-functional furniture, clever storage solutions, and personalized decor, you can create an inviting environment that feels both expansive and comfortable. Embrace these 15 small living room ideas to craft a space that reflects your style while ensuring a warm, welcoming, and spacious ambiance. Happy decorating!

Financial apps are different ball game. These apps keep client fund in the banks, which only insures them from BANK FAILURE, not app failure. 

Imagine a scenario where banking app fails for whatever reason (someone swindled them for a few million, they invested in wrong assets or whatever). Specially, in a scenario where these apps  fraudulently transferred money around and have a shortfall.

 I have heard a similar case happening in the US on CoffeeZilla. 

Following is what moneysavingexpert says about SideKick.

About FSCS protection for this account

Sidekick isn't a bank, so it uses Bondsmith to hold customer deposits in a ring-fenced account with OakNorth, so your money has the usual [£85,000 UK savings safety protection](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/safe-savings/). If Sidekick, Bondsmith or OakNorth Bank went bust, you'd get your money back (though it may take longer than if you had a direct relationship with the bank).

Any money held in your Sidekick Wallet is held in a ring-fenced bank account via the e-money and payments services provider Currencycloud. This bank account is with a major banking institution that Sidekick can't access. Although this means the funds in the Sidekick Wallet have a certain level of protection, we can't say how quickly you'd be able to get your money back if Sidekick went bust, so it's **probably not a good idea to keep a large sum of money in the Sidekick Wallet**. For safety, be sure to transfer all deposits and bonus interest into your OakNorth account (or elsewhere) – don't leave it in the Sidekick Wallet.

Haven't placed an order simply because of uncertainties around Google like DoJ split, Waymo as well as LLM Threat to search business.

I don't know anything about first two. But I run some tests on several LLMs to build something like AI Agent.

The task is to list each and every website related to a company. And rank the links so that official lists come on top of the list.

Tests used ChatGPT Deep Search, Perplexity Pro, Calude 3.7 Sonnet, Deepseek DeepThink R1, Grok Deeper Research, QWEN QWEN3-235B-A22B, Mistral Web Search, Manus High-Effort. And Gemini Deep Research with Flash 2.5.

Quick conclusion is that Gemini performed way better than others. Brought approximately 60 links. All active. Some of them are relevant PDFs. Went above and beyond the task assigned.

ChatGPT came second with 16 links. All good. But nothing extraordinary. Also took much longer than Gemini run.

The rest of the results full of hallucinations, dead or broken links, missing critical links etc.

So I know Google has been disappointing with AI endeavors recently. 

Yet their search know-how is so huge. And Google has the ability to use the latest and greatest data on web.

I expect a ""Last mover advantage"" for Google when it comes to LLMs.

I placed a small order of GOOG and GOOGL today. Because my little test convinces me they will be around for some time.

The question is, how much time?

I had a train at 1:25 PM from Anand Vihar station to my hometown, and usually, he drops me off, but this time, he had his endsem exams going on, so I went alone.

After reaching the station, I found out my train was delayed by almost 9 hours. I was devastated. I called my dad, and he suggested I stay at a relative's and travel the next morning.

My boyfriend’s exam was from 11 AM to 2 PM, but he submitted it 30mins early - just to call and wish me “Happy Journey.” When I told him what happened, he immediately started looking for alternate trains. Luckily, we found one at 5:10 PM from NDLS, and I booked it.

Here’s the sweetest part - he had his toughest exam the next day and was already exhausted from sleeping late and studying nonstop. Still, he came all the way to meet me. We hadn’t seen each other since April end, and we knew we wouldn’t be able to meet for the next 3 months because he had to leave for his hometown the same day his exams ended (which he couldn’t postpone).

We spent a few precious hours together, and he dropped me off for my train.

And it’s not just this day, he does so many little things that show his love. He remembers the lyrics to my favorite songs, even though he doesn’t listen to that genre. When I visit his flat, he always has small surprises - like decorating the room as a surprise. He’s a tea person, but every time I visit, he makes me the best coffee.

It’s these small, thoughtful moments that speak volumes.
Some men really do love with their whole heart, and I’m so lucky to have one of them.

1kn6jht,https://i.redd.it/p6sdbczdsx0f1.jpeg,Remote Work in Bali: Where to Work and How to Avoid Tax Trouble,"Bali has long been a mecca for digital nomads—cheap cost of living, tropical climate, and a thriving community of like-minded people. But as the island grows more popular, local authorities are paying closer attention to remote workers. How can you work legally in Bali, avoid tax issues, and where are the best coworking spaces? Let’s break it down.  

---  

Where to Work? Best Coworking Spaces & Cafés  

If you're a freelancer or work for a foreign company, Bali offers dozens of spots with fast Wi-Fi and a productive vibe:  

📌 Top Coworking Spaces:

- Dojo (Canggu) – A legendary spot with a pool and community events.  
- Tropical Nomad (Seminyak) – A quiet coworking space with day passes.  
- Outpost (Ubud, Canggu) – Premium workspace with private offices.  
- BWork (Ubud) – A budget-friendly option with reliable Wi-Fi.  

☕ Cafés with Good Wi-Fi:  

- The Shady Shack (Canggu) – Vegan café with plenty of power outlets.  
- Revolver Espresso (Seminyak) – Great for coffee lovers who need focus.  
- Lazy Cats (Ubud) – A cozy spot with fast internet.  

---  

💼 Legal Work: Visas & Taxes  

1. Which Visa Should You Use?
- Tourist Visa (B211A) – Up to 60 days, extendable (but technically doesn’t permit work).  
- Digital Nomad Visa (Planned, but not yet available) – Announced by the government, but details remain unclear.  
- Business Visa (B211B) – Better for long-term stays but requires a local sponsor.  

Important: If you work for a foreign company and get paid into an overseas account, Indonesian taxes don’t apply to you. But if your clients/employer are based in Indonesia, you’ll need a work visa (KITAS).  

2. Taxes: How to Stay Under the Radar?
- Don’t receive payments into an Indonesian bank account (unless you have a work visa).  
- Use PayPal, Wise, or foreign banks (Revolut, N26).  
- Avoid flaunting your income – Tax authorities aren’t actively hunting digital nomads yet, but audits can happen.  
- If you stay over 183 days per year – You technically become a tax resident, though enforcement is rare.  

---  

🚨 Risks: What Could Go Wrong?

- Immigration officers may ask about your work (it’s safer to say you’re traveling, not working).  
- Banks sometimes freeze accounts for suspicious transfers (avoid moving large sums to local cards).  
- Landlords may require a KITAS – Always check rental terms before moving in.  

---  

Final Tips: How to Work Stress-Free?

✅ Stick to a tourist visa (B211A) and extend it as needed.  
✅ Get paid into a foreign bank account.  
✅ Avoid working for Indonesian companies without a KITAS.  
✅ Choose coworking spaces with reliable internet.  

The visa can be issued from legalindonesia.id

Bali is still relatively lenient toward digital nomads, but rules could tighten. Stay updated on regulations and sort out your paperwork in advance!

We are relocating to Pinellas County in August. We = me, 53 year old divorcee 1 year out of a 22 year DV marriage with my 14 yo daughter. We've been house hunting for a couple of months now but really wanted to reach out to this sub to see if you can help us find our vibe. We want a city where golf carts are the norm, where on a random Thursday night, we can hop in the golf cart, hit a hole in the wall pub with live music (preferably on sand), an area with eclectic little shops, and a vast array of ma and pa restaurants or pop-up eateries. While cliche, I'd love to cart to a sandy beach with fresh coffee for sunrise or with an adult beverage for sunset with sand under me.

While yes, I'm in my early 50s, I don't act like it and I certainly don't want to be in a retiree vibe area. We're both super laid back but need to minimize the culture shock for my daughter who has gone to parochial private schools until now - she wants to do public high school. While I'm fairly certain this isn't an issue down there, up here being exposed to more than white people requires intention. My daughter is black and I'm translucently white :). It's a struggle here to find areas that are full of culture - so that's important to us and the schools need to be ok (which my research seems to lead to Pinellas County having great schools).

I will need to commute to Midtown in Tampa once or twice a week and need to be within an hour of an international airport and within an hour of McDill AFB.

We've looked at Dunedin, dig it but are struggling to find something we really love. What other areas would fit what we're looking for? (If adjusting my ridiculous criteria is a requirement, please don't be afraid to tell me that too!)

Thanks so very much for helping us out!

If you're drilling holes into brick walls to put up shelves or something and the room is painted you're likely to end up with brick dust spilled in the room. Even if you try tools/techniques to catch it there's still a decent chance some dust will spill. 

I hadn't thought of it until I needed to clean bright orange brick dust from a white painted room but brick dust is difficult to clean. Most spills we clean up are water soluble, like say coffee grounds or soil, a damp cloth or wet sponge will pick up most of it then dissolve and absorb the rest. But brick dust doesn't dissolve in water and it can be incredibly fine grains and it's usually bright orange. Basic tissues or a wet cloth doesn't get all of it, just pushes it around and leaves an orange smear on the white wall.

Makeup remover pads have incredible surface area, lots of fibres and strands intended to remove fine makeup particles and their oils. It's easily 10x as effective as a normal tissue and they come in giant dispenser packs for £1. ",11,1747310868.0,LifeProTips,3,0.72,False

(M3О) is a fearful avoidant. I'm pretty sure we're both ADHD as well. We met organically in a coffee shop where he asked for my instagram. Our dates were amazing. He wined and dined me, took me to spas, took me to his villa abroad after 2 months. Told me he loved me after 4 months. We had a blast. Shortly after, I naturally started the 'what are we?' conversation. He said he couldn't do a relationship. I left and three days later he said he could but he wanted it to be his way so I left it. A month later, still nothing. I questioned this but didn't want to seem pushy. He asked me three weeks later in the coffee shop where we met. I didn't need this big question. For me, it's just a natural progression and a quick 'yeah, we're an item now aren't we. Anyway, I need to express the amazing, intimate times and conversations we had where he’d say things like I want to get you pregnant, I’ll want to marry you one day. The good was so right, it fit like a glove. We both expresses it with affection and words. 8 weeks after we made it official, he had trouble with his businesses and contractors stealing money and he said he couldn't do a relationship because he was fully concentrating on fixing things that had gone a bit wrong. From there, we've gone back and forth for six months in a situationship - not a relationship. It's the same as when we were in a relationship but there were no plans to see each other. We did used to see each other two/three times a week since we've known each other. All last minute or once he'd ticked everything else off his list that day.
He was very fun and affectionate when we were together but there was always a cycle.
He'd need 'space. This would mean maybe he'd be gone for a day, sometimes 3.
Inconveniences in his life would require him to take 'space. If we argued, he required 'space.
He wouldn't return like hey, I really wanna see you. Are you busy later or tomorrow. It would be 'Hi' and then nothing. I'd have to bring him back. So the more this happened, the more anxious I became when we'd be intimate or he'd opened up because I knew it would mean days of 'space' to come. I tried so hard to be cool about it and sometimes I was but other times, I couldn't quite self soothe because it became so frequent. It got to the point that every week, we'd go through the cycle of space, anxiety, chase, repair, repeat. 11 days ago, I asked if he thought he'd ever trust me and the conversation evolved further until he was saying all of these things to me:

- I'm not your guy
- He said I make him feel unsafe
- He loves my sex drive but it scares him cos it makes me a cheating risk
- He said he doesn't want a woman who's been passed around. He wants a prize
- It's different with men and women. It's expected of men to sleep with multiple people
- That if I was to go away alone, I would be treated like I was cheating
- If he was to go away alone, then I would need to be ok with it
- He hasn't given us getting married one single thought
- He said what he determines as a slut is different to what I determine a slut. In a round about way, calling me a slut
- He doesn't believe that I haven't been with anyone else since we've been dating
- He said he'd cheat if he got bored in the relationship
- He said he would never feel safe in a relationship with me
- He said he'd cheat if he felt unsafe in a relationship
- He said we could only ever be 'friends' for him to feel safe 
- The usual I don't want kids and marriage
- There's nothing I can do to change his opinion of me

Inbetween these hurtful things, he'd also say things like:

- You're a prize
- You're everything
- I'm in love with you
- I want to fall further into this with you but I just can't trust it
- You're just part of my story now

It's so confusing. I got out of the car and didn't contact him. He contact me a few days later with the most genuine apology, said he was embarrassed and that he didn't know it was in him to do that to me. That it breaks my heart to see me so upset. He doesn't want this to be the end and he wanted to fix this and wanted another chance. When I said fix what, a situationship? He said he's not ready for a relationship but will be once he's fixed his life issues.

Call me out on what I did wrong and tell me what the hell is going on in this man's brain? I never gave him any reason not to trust me. Not one. I was always warm and loving. We had a great sex life. Like almost too good. I don't understand.",1,1747310729.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

But I'm a HE that can't budget.

HHI $400k gross combined. $210k F, $190k M. Plus maybe a $30k gross bonus.

We have all the right things in place. 

- We max our supers about $430k each and doing some catch ups until next FY as our balances are under $500k. Both set to high growth.
- we have an IP valued $750k with $280k mortgage left, now positively geared. It's in the higher earners name as it was bought pre relationship 20 years ago. Strata not too bad but holding costs around 9k a year (rates, land tax, strata, compliance, maintenance)
- PPOR valued at $2M with a $500k mortgage left, minimum $6800 a month and we pay extra $4500 bit dip into the extra most months.

It's the rest. We have 2 kids. Public schools but still around $3500 each per year. 2 sports/music lessons each. Some additional medical expenses for one of them.
Large house with utilities to match. A big domestic holiday once a year around $15k. No extravagant dinners out. I cook 6 nights a week, make kids homemade lunches. Buy a coffee in the days I'm in office, bring own lunch. Have the occasional girls night or boys night out.
Husband is a bit of a spender on golf stuff, clothes and protein supplements. He is on a health kick and has lost 25kg so recognize he needs a new wardrobe.
Our expenses are anywhere from $8-13k a month looking at credit card statements. I have no idea where it's going. I'm not a numbers person so it's overwhelming. Partner takes no part in finances and I feel the weight on my shoulders trying to solve this on my own.

Goal is to smash mortgage then invest within and outside of super, retire around 60.

I need help. Would a place like mybudget be good for us? Looking at a budget spreadsheet makes me anxious. I don't have the patience nor inclination to download a years worth of expenses and analyse. I think I need to restructure our accounts into buckets but have no idea where to start.

Who can help? We had a financial advisor who helped guide on the overall plan, but I need someone that can help me with budgeting. We are time poor and lost.

Be gentle, I never expected to be earning this much. I was an awesome budgeter when I was earning $60k and had no kids. Now I feel out of control and anxious every day.",1,1747310382.0,AusHENRYover250k,1,1.0,False

1kn6c36,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkerDistraction/comments/1kn6c36/why_industry_part_one_the_assessment_of_value/,"""Why industry?"" Part one: The assessment of value added","So, i’m trying to create a series of debates on this subreddit that touch on relevant topics for industrial workers. If their fruitful, the debates will be used to draft scripts for content to be created.

These will include touchy subjects: immigration, taxation, economic and political systems and their internal rules, the military and the draft, and yes, even my take on gender issues — but in a way that i hope moves beyond the tired culture-war debates about trans people in bathrooms or sports teams.

To start, though, I want to address a fundamental question: **What even makes industry — and the jobs it provides — so special?**

This discussion is aimed primarily at an American audience, since it’s the biggest audience on Reddit and because the U.S., as the hegemon of Western industrial nations, still sets the global example. That said, I may use examples from German industrial policy when relevant, because they’re easier for me to explain. I invite you to disagree, amend, and build on what I lay out here. Let’s go.

# The Assessment of Value Added

Over the last decade, governments in Western countries — whether conservative or liberal — have become increasingly anxious about bringing back high-value industries. The ongoing tariff and trade wars initiated under Donald Trump are a testament to that. But even before that, Democratic administrations pushed initiatives like the CHIPS Act, and European countries — especially Germany — began subsidizing advanced manufacturing in semiconductors and energy technologies.

This shift comes after the bursting of two major economic bubbles — the dot-com bust and the subprime mortgage crisis — and in the wake of China’s meteoric rise after joining the WTO in 2001. China’s ability to leverage industrial exports into real economic growth has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and now poses a direct challenge to the West’s economic primacy.

Let me be clear: I’m no fan of the Chinese Communist Party, and I don’t romanticize their system. I find the favoritism, corruption, and lack of civic-mindedness in parts of Chinese society distasteful. But I absolutely respect the skilled workers and hard laborers who built that system from the ground up. Their output speaks for itself. I also hope Chinese and other Asian workers find this subreddit and join the conversation. There’s something to learn from everyone.

In the U.S., the 1990s economic boom created the impression that we had moved beyond industrial work. Job growth came mostly from the service sector — finance, real estate, insurance, marketing, and consulting. It became common to suggest that low-value industry was outdated as a model for sustaining well-paid jobs for the masses (we'll dive into why that's not necessarily true on another occasion), and we’d all make our livings pushing paper or assets instead.

# The Problem with “Value Added” Metrics

In national accounting, “value added” is measured as the market price of a final good or service, minus the cost of inputs: labor, capital, and intermediate goods. For high-level planning or tax forecasting, this works well enough.

But it also leads to massive misreadings of what’s truly productive in the economy.

Say you’re running a production line at high utilization that, after subtracting the costs, generates thousands of dollars’ worth of hard plastic goods each shift — goods that go into homes, vehicles, tools, energy systems, or other essential infrastructure. If that line stops, the company loses money instantly. You’re producing something real and essential. You're not doing that work alone, but the high level of automation in Western countries in that field usually means you're administering several machines, and with that, often hundreds of thousands of dollars in economic output.

Compare this with someone flipping real estate or financial assets. They may “add” millions in value by manipulating spreadsheets or riding asset bubbles. But that value is often speculative, extracted through rent-seeking or price inflation, and it disappears when the bubble pops. The work is mostly about moving claims on wealth — not creating new material abundance.

Economists call this the confusion between value creation and value extraction. GDP treats both as equally productive. But they’re not.

# What Else Distorts the Picture?

Several factors inflate “value added” in the service sector without reflecting real productivity:

* **Redundant or unmeasurable outputs:** Bureaucracies and management layers often generate work that doesn’t materially improve outcomes — the kind of work described in the now-famous concept of “bullshit jobs.”
* **Monopoly rents and regulatory capture:** Firms in healthcare, utilities, and finance often profit by limiting competition, not by improving services.
* **No physical surplus:** Most services don’t leave behind durable goods or infrastructure. Once performed, they need to be repeated just to maintain the status quo — not grow it.

And it's not just the bullshit.

I’m not trying to dunk on what are perceived as low-level service workers.

Still, compare industry workers to a barista making even the most expensive coffee. What’s the market value of maybe a hundred fifteen-dollar coffees in one shift? $1,500? Subtract the cost of powder, milk, machine upkeep, hygiene, and overhead. There’s no comparison.

And yet: I want the barista who makes my coffee each morning to earn a good living. His work helps me be productive. It’s not physically possible for him to match the industrial output of a machine-and-human production chain, but that doesn’t mean his labor is worthless. He provides something real — and should be able to live decently for it.

Still, we should be clear: much of what is counted as “value added” in the modern service economy — from speculative finance to layered consulting to unnecessary bureaucracy — or does little to meet people’s real needs, or has margins too low to raise via efficiency, or is easily automated away entirely.

In industry, it’s the **capital density** — the level of automation and tooling — that raises a workers productivity on a much greater scale in the first place.

The supposed value of many high-paying service jobs evaporates when technology shifts, asset prices crash, or political winds change. What remains essential are the material outputs that keep societies running: food, energy, infrastructure, tools, vehicles, machines.

These things might fluctuate in price or profitability, but they are never obsolete. They form the economic base. Everything else but agriculture rests on top of that.

# The Limits of “Service-Led” Economies

There are, of course, some service-sector jobs that produce real, vital output:

* **Medical care,** which is literally life-saving and irreplaceable.
* **Certain IT services,** which — once deployed — can scale to billions of people at near-zero marginal cost.

But those jobs, while critical, cannot sustain a labor force of hundreds of millions. Healthcare is, in fact, a massive part of Western economies — but it can’t be all there is.

And ultra-scalable IT work doesn’t require many people. That’s the whole point: scale with minimal labor input. That leaves a huge portion of the population at risk of being shunted into low-productivity, low-wage service roles — or into “value extraction” jobs that do more harm than good.

That’s why **industry matters.** It creates material wealth, supports broad employment, and anchors the real economy. We need to understand that.

# Your Turn

I’d like to hear your take on the value of labor. Critique my text and ideas. Point out flaws. Add your own.

Tell me what you’ve observed or been taught — whether from books, work experience, or elsewhere.

You might’ve already noticed that much of this overlaps with the classical “critique of political economy” in Marxist thought. That’s true — and it’s fine to refer to those frameworks where they make sense.

As for me, I accept that those ideologies contain valid critiques. But I reject many of their proposed solutions. We’ll get to that in future discussions.

For now, I want us to focus on the diagnosis — not the ideology.

1kn6afy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/1kn6afy/kendu_the_first_brandcoin/,Kendu - The First Brandcoin,"Kendu, a coin backed by  an insane community, who relentlessly pushes the coin forwards and strives for a better future for each other, has recently broken a year long down trend. Redistributing a massive amount of tokens from early whales to the average holder, I personally have lowered my average purchase from well of 100 million to a market cap of just 20 million!

I am not selling anytime soon and I know there’s thousands of other people like me.

**Why choose Kendu**

Ask yourself this? What did Shiba Inu, Pepe and other billion dollar memecoins have in common? Was it a funny meme? Was it favoured by KOLs? Was there bots? What was it?

It was because they were backed by a solid community, who dominated and took over social media. Kendu is very similar but we are changing the game, we have expanded past social media and are now creating real life products.

But anyways, is Kendu taking over social media?

Yes, we are. I am 100% sure you have at least heard of us on social media over the past year, if you’re reading this you probably haven’t bought Kendu, but here is your chance.

With our catalogue of IRL products and events, retail will run to us. For newcomers, something physical will make a world of difference since it shows that Kendu is more than just a few numbers on a screen, it is a real-life movement that will spread across the planet!

**IRL Initiatives**  


* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. The other 2 festivals, was Miami Music Week and Miami Art Basel. At these festivals, murals were created, Kendu energy cocktails were given out and Kendu merch was given out! 
* We have also will be having a Kendu Hot Dog stand in Florida soon
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport. There has recently been a media drop from these events. There is also talks of parties coming soon!
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peeks. I think it will be available on Steam.
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art

Since we have worked so hard, on our social media efforts, a lot of people are watching Kendu and at the first sign of green, there will be so much FOMO and the pump will be insane.

A particular achievement that I am most proud of, is the fact that Kendu reached 50k Certik votes, the 2^(nd) coin to ever do so….The first coin was Pepe(that reached 10 billion outside of a bull run), Certik also rates Kendu’s community as 98/100, I haven’t seen a coin with a higher score, especially not at 22 million market cap. Kendu has so much room to grow and we will do it with, or without you. But I’d rather do it with you!   
  
You can find me in the telegram as Luke Skywalker and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have(but there is hundreds of other people who will also be happy to do so!)

I woke up feeling disappointed as I looked at the empty space on my bed. I was hoping Ian, my boyfriend of the last two years and the future alpha of our pack, would have snuck into my room last night.  
  
Today is my eighteenth birthday. The first official day I can sniff out my mate. I was hoping Ian would have been here when I woke up since he decided to go out with his friends last night. I didn’t say anything when plans of us hanging out changed, but I should have. I wanted to, but I didn’t want to put on a show in front of his friends when they barged into the pack house yesterday. I just let him go, hoping he would choose me.  
  
“So, what do you think?” I asked my wolf, Tundra, as I stepped into the shower.  
  
“I don’t know what to think, Ash. I know he cares about us, but is that really enough,” she sighed.  
  
My blissful birthday bumble had been popped as I got ready to head to the pack house to find him. I wanted him to be my fated mate. I love him. Before his mother died, I spent so much time with her, even before Ian and I got together.  
  
I came here to live with my mother’s sister after both my parents died. She was newly mated and not ready to handle a soon-to-be nine-year-old who just lost everything. Don’t get me wrong, Aunt Grace and her mate, Brad, are wonderful, and I owe them both so much.  
  
After I was ready, I looked at myself in the mirror one more time before heading downstairs. Aunt Grace was sitting at the table, looking down at her phone as she sipped a mug full of coffee.  
  
“Good morning,” I came up behind her and gave her a hug.  
  
“Happy Birthday, sweetie,” she squealed, and I giggled. “You must be so excited for today. I half expected Alpha Ian to be walking in behind you.”  
  
“Yeah, me too,” I mumbled, letting her go.  
  
“Is everything okay?” She asked me, the excitement of the day now lost.  
  
“Yeah, of course, I’m going to go find Ian,” I smiled before walking out of the kitchen to the front door.  
  
“Good luck,” she called out as I closed the door behind me.  
  
The cold fall air nipped my hot skin as I walked down the path to the sidewalk. The pack house was a ten-minute walk from my house. There was a new dusting of snow, and the early morning sun was still rising over the tree line. It would have been a beautiful morning if my stomach wasn’t twisted into knots. And the closer I walked to the park house, the tighter those knots became.  
  
“I’m glad I didn’t eat this morning,” I mumbled to Tundra.  
  
“Everything is going to work out, Ash, don’t worry so much.”  
  
I stopped at the end of the driveway and took a deep breath before walking up to the oak front doors. As soon as I stepped inside, the most delicious scent hit me. Musk, cedar, and vanilla.  
  
“Mate,” Tundra purred, and I smiled. My mate is here.  
  
I followed the scent up to the alpha floor, and that's when I knew it was Ian. Other members lived in the pack house, but this floor only had Ian and his father, Alpha Jason.  
  
The scent was stronger as I stood in front of his bedroom door. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. This was the moment I had been waiting for—for two years.  
  
Grunts and groans caused me to open my eyes and look at the door in front of me.  
  
“Yes, Ian. Yes, right there,” a woman cried out. Before I knew what I was doing, I threw open the door. What I saw is something I could never unsee.  
  
Ian was standing at the end of his bed, naked. Sweat glistened his skin as he thrust his hips. I couldn’t say a word as I watched him with legs wrapped around his waist. Those weren’t my legs.  
  
Tundra let out a murderous growl, and the room stopped.  
  
Ian turned to face the door, his steel-blue eyes meeting my green ones.  
  
“Ashlyn,” he stammered. With his body turned, I was able to see the woman lying naked on his bed with my mate and boyfriend inside of her. Nicole.  
  
“This isn’t what it looks like,” he stepped away from her, and Nicole fumbled to get underneath the blanket.  
  
My eyes filled with tears as I wondered what I did to deserve this. Ian was my best friend. We have been together for almost two years. The entire pack knew we were together. I felt like a f\*\*\*\*\*g joke.  
  
“It looks like my boyfriend and best friend are naked together. Am I missing something?” I crossed my arms over my chest. Ian stuttered, unable to get the words out as he stood in front of me naked, his d\*\*k covered in another woman. “I’m sorry, my mate and best friend are f\*\*\*\*\*g,” I yelled. This was all too much for me to handle right now. Their betrayal ripped at my soul.  
  
I watched as Ian sniffed the air with his wolf, Jax, coming forward.  
  
“Mate,” he exhaled.  
  
“Ex-mate, Ian. I, Ashlyn Knight, future alpha of the Emerald Lake pack, reject you, Ian Walker, future alpha of the Blue Moon pack.” I didn’t wait for him to answer as I stepped out of his room, slamming the door behind me. My heart twisted painfully, and my legs wobbled as I grabbed the railing.  
  
I needed to get out of here. I couldn’t stay here with this constant reminder of their betrayal.  
  
Relief hit me when I made it down the last step and was so close to the front door. I was stopped when strong arms wrapped around me. Ian’s father squeezed me close. He was the father I needed after my own passed.  
  
“Happy Birthday, sweetheart.” He let me go and stepped back. Looking up at him, I felt like I was going to break. I had so much here, but I couldn’t stay.  
  
“I need to leave,” I choked, and his face fell.  
  
“What’s wrong? Where’s Ian?” He asked, gripping my shoulders.  
  
“The pack. I need to leave the pack.” I stammered as I tried to hold down the need to cry.  
  
“Ashlyn,” he pulled me against his chest again, and I was so close to breaking down. I was going to miss Alpha Jason. He had taught me so much about being an alpha and made this place feel like home.  
  
“Do you want to tell me what happened?” He mumbled softly as he held me. I shook my head. The moment that happened was raw in my mind, and I wanted to run away.  
  
I held onto him when a commotion came from the floors above.  
  
“Go, sweetheart. Be safe.” He kissed the top of my head. I looked up at him, and he nodded. With that, I rushed out the front door and ran off in the direction of home.  
  
I need to get out of here.  
  
I stormed into the house and marched up the stairs to my room. I could hear my aunt calling to me, but I couldn’t stop. The pain in my chest was eating away at my soul, and it burned.  
  
“I’m so sorry, Tundra,” I cried, crumbling to my knees beside my bed. She didn’t say anything, only whimpered at the loss of her mate.  
  
“Ashlyn, what the hell is going on?” Aunt Grace pushed open my door before she gasped. “Sweetie, what’s wrong?” She rushed to kneel beside me.  
  
“He cheated. He was my mate, and he cheated,” I cried as she wrapped me in her arms.  
  
“Oh, my sweet, Ashlyn,” she exhaled as I cried on her shoulder.  
  
I lost track of how long I sat on the floor in her arms and cried. Why would he do this to me? The burning question swirled in my mind as my aunt held me.  
  
“Hey, let's head into the city for a few days. We can go shopping and stay at one of those crazy expensive hotels. There will be a spa where we can get pampered. It will be good for you.” I looked up at her, and she smiled, but her eyes were sad. I nodded, and she pulled me close again.  
  
“Pack a bag, and we will leave soon. I need to call Brad,” she pulled away, kissing my forehead before looking at me again. “Everything is going to be okay.” She stood up and left me still sitting on the floor. I took a big breath before wiping away the tears on my cheeks.  
  
Pack a bag; that’s something I could do right now.  
  
I stood up and went into my closet to pull some clothes together. I couldn’t shake what I saw. Ian was my best friend. We were so good together until his mother passed away. That’s when he started to pull away. He spent more time with his friends, drinking. I just never thought he would step out. I was giving him space to grieve in his own way. But I could never forgive that, no matter how much I loved him.  
  
“Ready?” Aunt Grace asked from the open door. I was stuffing some clothes into a backpack. I nodded, zipping up the bag. I grabbed my phone charger off the bedside table and stuffed it in my purse before following my aunt out of my room.  
  
I needed to get out of here. I don’t have much money, but I will figure it out when I get there. I had to. I couldn’t stay here.  
  
My aunt took my bag, and with my purse in hand, I climbed into the passenger seat of her SUV. My mind buzzed with mind links, and my phone buzzed in my pocket, but I ignored it. I didn’t need to open them to know it was Ian and Nicole. But what could they possibly say about their actions? She was my friend, and he was my boyfriend.Falling out of love",1,1747310057.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

There are also several minor additions and changes that are not listed in the changelogs.

# During Wave 4

Our original plan was to release fixes to the steps graphs, 30K step achievement and to a few other issues. We're almost finished with the work, but there are still a couple things that are missing. We will be releasing another update as soon as possible that addresses these issues.

During Wave 4, we'll likely be quite busy with customer service, marketing and general community management. We do have plans to release a few new smaller game mechanics during the Wave 4 if possible, and ship out more content to the game. We'll also be fixing existing issues and improving issues found with iOS smart watch support.

Known issues

* The game crashes while using Apple Watch if the game is in the background. You can avoid this by not keeping the game in background, and instead just closing the game entirely.
* While using smart watches, the game often changes your step source device from a watch back to phone. This is a critical issue and can result in loss of steps, and we're working to fix it ASAP.

* Outlined sprites in the game look like melted plastic. This is a rendering issue on Flutter, you can solve it by going to game settings and toggling ""render using shaders"" off.
* Steps graphs are showing incorrect step counts. This is what we've been working to fix, and will be fixed ASAP.
* 30K step achievement is not registering steps. Related to the issue above, will be fixed ASAP.
* The minimap doesn't update properly or shows me being in the middle of the ocean. Restart the game or tap on the map, and it'll correct itself.

# Until next time

That's all for today! I am very excited to see new players joining the game.

I really did. But I can’t be the only one trying anymore.”

The apartment felt empty without her, though her mug was still in the sink, lipstick smudged on the rim. I used to tease her about never finishing her coffee. Now I’d give anything to see that half-full cup again.

She used to talk about sunsets, dreams of Italy, how silence wasn’t the same as peace. I listened—halfway. I thought love meant just being there.

But she needed more.

I didn’t call her. Not yet. Instead, I watered the plant she used to sing to, stood by the window, and watched the sunset she always said I was missing.

And for the first time, I saw it.

This place? Massive. The [Broward County Convention Center](https://www.ftlauderdalecc.com/) looks like someone gave a casino a LinkedIn makeover and added beach vibes. And somehow it's still not big enough for the **10,000+ attendees** swarming every booth that blinks or offers coffee. There are people pitching, chatting, selfie-ing, speed-walking with badge lanyards flapping like battle flags — and we’re proudly among them, dodging crypto evangelists and chasing the next espresso shot like it’s alpha.

# The Energy? Between Corporate Hustle and Carnival Chaos

Every other conversation starts with *""Did you see that panel on Brazil?""* — because yeah, **Brazil is the moment**. If you came here wondering whether 2025 is the year to [Start an Online Casino in Brazil](https://www.softswiss.com/knowledge-base/start-online-casino-brazil/), the answer is: everyone already is, or at least says they are. We’ve heard “LatAm is the next frontier” approximately 73 times and honestly? They’re not wrong. The sessions are full, the hallway buzz is real, and the heat around that market is enough to grill a steak.

Elsewhere, the FanDuel guys are demoing some “real-time RG AI” feature that watches your betting behavior and tells you to chill before you spiral. Half of us were like “wow, cool tech,” and the other half looked nervously at their sportsbook tabs.

# Panels Are Great, But the Floor Is Wild

You blink and suddenly you’re talking to someone who just raised $3M for a platform that “gamifies live dealer interaction with predictive emotion modeling.” What does that mean? No clue. But their booth had churros and a wheel you could spin for socks, so we’re listening.

The expo hall feels like a weird dream where every conversation might turn into a business deal or a new podcast episode. Sometimes both. Everyone’s doing the same dance: *“What vertical are you in?” → awkward chuckle → swap QR codes → mutual promises of coffee that may or may not ever happen.*

**🌅 About Last Night…**

The Opening Party at The Wharf was absolute madness. Mojitos flowed, DJs yelled, and yes — someone 100% tried to pitch a licensing deal while doing shots. We may or may not have seen a karaoke rendition of “Despacito” from a CFO. It’s all part of the ritual now. We’re in too deep to stop.

And guess what? The party isn’t over. The official networking events are still rolling through May 14–15, so if you missed the mojito madness — there's still time to make some beautifully bad decisions in good company.

**Survival Notes From the Trenches**

Our feet hurt, our LinkedIn apps are exploding, and someone definitely tried to sell us a “blockchain-ready igaming wallet for Gen Z” before breakfast. We’ve had empanadas for lunch and insight on LatAm tax regs for dessert. If that’s not balanced networking, what is?

Oh — and sunscreen. We didn’t think we’d need it. We were wrong. You *will* end up outside, lured into “just one drink” by someone you met five minutes ago, only to realize it's 6pm and you still haven’t eaten.

**🏁 In Short: Would We Come Again? Hell Yes.**

[SBC Summit Americas 2025](https://sbcevents.com/en/sbc-summit-americas/) is exactly what we needed: a chaotic, charming, multilingual monster of a show where the future of gaming is being written on cocktail napkins and debated over caipirinhas.

We came for the panels. We stayed for the people. We might leave with a partnership. Or a sunburn. Or both.

If you’re here too — come find us. We’re the ones standing by the coffee bar whispering *“What’s your CPA in Brazil?”* like it’s a code phrase.

Let’s get weird, Florida 🐊

1kn645r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kn645r/aitah_for_ending_a_friendship_over_their_crush_on/,AITAH for ending a friendship over their crush on me and their unmanaged mental health?,"***TW:*** *Concerns over self-harm*

*Note: This happened a few years ago, but I'll write everything as if it happened more recently. Details such as age are written at the time they occurred.* 

I (late 20s F) became friends with Stacy and Jennifer (both early 30s F) through our work, where I started as an intern about two years ago. In my first year on the job, the three of us became friends outside of work: think weekend trips, a group chat, etc. 

About a year into our friendship, we all had a friendsgiving at Jennifer's. Stacy offered to drive me. On the drive back, I asked Stacy to drop me off at the apartment of someone I was seeing. She got quiet, refused to talk to me, and started driving 10-mph over the speed limit on roads that were windy and not well lit. Needless to say, it wasn't a fun drive. I felt a bit unsafe, to the point where I asked Stacy to let me out a few blocks early just so I could get out of the car, despite it being nighttime.

Fast forward a few days, and Stacy asks to talk. We get coffee one afternoon at work. She goes our whole time without addressing what happened. I don't push it -- perhaps she's not ready. Later I'm at the airport about to go home for Thanksgiving, and I get a text from Stacy saying the reason she acted weird on the drive was because she had a crush on me, and so she didn't like dropping me off at someone else's house. I didn't respond -- probably not the best move on my part, but I didn't quite know what to say and was about to spend a lot of time with family. I'm gay, and I knew Stacy was bi, so this wasn't an issue of homophobia. It was just very unexpected, and I didn't know what to do. When I got back, we talked, I apologized for not texting her back, and I told her that I don't date people I work with, and that besides, I was in love with someone who I'd known for the past 8 years and I was going to see if I could make it work with them. During this conversation, Stacy told me that she had told Jennifer and other people we worked with about her crush on me, which made me uncomfortable, especially since Stacy was more established than I was at our workplace. I asked Stacy what I could do to make the situation easier on her, and she told me it would be helpful if I didn't talk about crushes or my romantic life around her. I agreed.

During my friendship with Stacy, there were other times she got moody and reacted similarly to that drive: One time, I was poking fun at her for not having her transit card, but I had an extra and let her borrowed mine. She didn't like the jokes I was making, so she didn't talk to me for the rest of the ride, and got off without saying goodbye to me, even though we were heading in the same direction after our stop. Whenever Stacy asked to hang out and I told her I couldn't, she would always ask why, as if an excuse was necessary. One time after I'd gone on a long run, Stacy asked if I wanted to get lunch  -- I told her I was tired after the run and probably needed to sleep. She then alluded to that she was thinking of harming herself, so I said I'd meet her. I also mentioned to our friend Jennifer that this happened, just so she'd keep an eye out if Stacy had any depressive episodes. (At this point, Jennifer and Stacy lived together, too.)

About a year and a half after the crush-announcement: It didn't work out with the longtime friend I was in love with (we remain friends), and I start dating someone new. This is my first serious relationship since becoming friends with Stacy and Jennifer, and I wanted to share with them all my nervous excitement about it. Because of this, I wanted to check-in with Stacy to see if it'd be OK if I talked with them about my girlfriend and ideally meet her -- my new girlfriend was hosting a birthday party, and she said I could invite friends, so I wanted to invite both Stacy and Jennifer.

Stacy and I met at her place to talk. I told her that I really wanted to be able to share details about my romantic life with her and Jennifer. (I'd also been avoiding talking about it with Jennifer, too -- Stacy would sometimes feel left out if we talked about things without her.) I told her our friendship felt conditional on my not sharing this major part of my life, and I didn't like it. 

To my surprise, Stacy shared that she still had a crush on me, and that because we no longer worked together and because it didn't work out romantically with my long-time friend, she thought I would give us a chance. I was shocked: I had no idea that Stacy had held on to the reasons I gave her for turning her advance down, and I also felt a little betrayed. Was our friendship just a ploy to date me? Did she even like me as a friend? I explained to Stacy that I'm sorry she misconstrued what I had to say, and that those reasons, while true, were a way to let her down easy -- I didn't think we were a good dating match, and didn't want her to hold on hope. I also told her that I needed a bit of time away from our friendship -- Stacy's moodiness was impacting our friendship, and that -- coupled with her not wanting to hear about my personal life -- felt bad for me. Stacy then shared with me that she had gone to a psychiatrist and she had been diagnosed with BPD, and was going to start medication. I said I was happy for her that she went to the doctor and was starting treatment. 

Stacy was upset about our friendship break but seemed to understand in the moment. When she asked about the timeline of this break, I said I didn't know how long it would last, but probably a couple months. 

While Stacy seemed to respect my need for a break in the moment, she started texting me a few days later. I politely but firmly reiterated that I needed space. This whole situation led to her having a breakdown -- Jennifer ended up calling me asking where Stacy was and that she was worried about harming herself. I told her what had happened and that I didn't know where she was. In the coming weeks, Jennifer told me that she was upset that I abandoned Stacy during her mental breakdown, and seemed to imply that I wasn't friends with her because of her mental illness. 

Stacy and I didn't become friends again, and my friendship with Jennifer dissolved into a collegial workplace relationship (which made me sad). While I knew that ending my friendship with Stacy was the right choice for me, I'm not sure I handled it the best way. And Jennifer clearly doesn't think what I did was right.

\- kept windows free as they will be full length and let light in from north and south, hence the sink is against a wall.

\- I like an island and didn't want to put a hob on it but for social and entertaining purposes + watching tv, it feels better. I didn't want to be facing a wall cooking and trying to host

\- The designs are not final or anything so some slightly unfinished where couldn't find appropriate units

The coffee shop.

""After we get married, you'll quit your job and become a full-time mom,"" the man arrogantly declared.

Katherine Galatea looked at the man from her blind date, a middle-aged man with thinning hair, a bulky figure, and nearing his forties.

Her stepmother, Lillian Galatea, must be afraid that she would marry a good man, forcing her to meet such an old scumbag.

Katherine sneered.

This middle-aged man was initially dissatisfied with Katherine's smoky eyes, but considering her slender figure and good temperament, he thought she would be beautiful when undressed.

So he asked, ""Miss, how tall are you without shoes?""

Katherine casually stirred her coffee and replied, ""Five and a half feet.""

The middle-aged man was satisfied with this. ""You are somewhat suitable for me. I'm nearly 5.9 feet tall, which is the perfect height difference between us! When we kiss, you'll have to tiptoe, but it's okay; I can bend down to match you!""

It was well known that mediocre and self-absorbed men who claimed to be 5.9 feet tall were at most 5.7 feet!

Katherine looked at him speechlessly. ""Sir, you might not be aware of the height required for a girl to tiptoe and kiss a man.""

The middle-aged man frowned, displeased. ""What do you mean by that?""

At that moment, a tall and stern man walked into the coffee shop.

Katherine glanced and saw Alexander Melville, who had just entered. She became interested and walked over to him.

""Hello, excuse me. I want to use your height to demonstrate what a real height difference is!""

Alexander furrowed his brow coldly.

Before he could refuse, Katherine grabbed his tie and pulled it down, tiptoed, and accurately kissed his lips.

""Did you see that? At the very least, you should be as tall as him to deserve a girl's tiptoeing kiss!""

""You..."" The middle-aged man was infuriated and stood up, pointing at Katherine.

""You are an unscrupulous woman, actually kissing a stranger! Just wait. I will tell the matchmaker about your misdeeds and tarnish your reputation. No one will ever go on a blind date with you again!""

This was exactly what she wanted!

After this incident spread, she wondered how Lillian would continue to find strange men for her blind dates!

Katherine disdainfully snorted, then thanked the tall man who had ""helped"" her.

""Sir, thank you for your kind assistance! See you later!""

With that, she turned around to leave, but her wrist was firmly grabbed by a cold hand!

A deep and chilling voice reached Katherine's ears.

""You kissed me forcefully, and now you think you can just walk away?""

Katherine felt a strong sense of oppression and looked up, only to be met with a strikingly handsome face.

What a breathtakingly beautiful face!

He had mature, styled hair and deep features on his handsome face, exuding a dangerous and fierce aura.

Katherine had been too focused on dealing with the cheesy man earlier, so she had simply picked the tallest man around without carefully examining his appearance.

Now that she took a closer look, this gentleman was indeed extraordinarily handsome. From his demeanor, she knew he was not an ordinary person!

Katherine furrowed her brows slightly.

""What do you want then?""

Alexander looked at Katherine with extreme gloominess, his lips moving as if about to say something.

At that moment, one of his black-clad subordinates who had been waiting nearby answered a phone call.

He approached with a grave expression to report, ""Mr. Melville, there's been a change in plans! Sophia's flight encountered severe weather and had to turn back.

Two weeks ago I had a panic attack and went to the ER, guess what, my BP was 210:90. Of course instead of listening to my story, the doctor told me she wont let me go if I dont start taking BP medication. 

One day later I had the 24 hour control, having perfect conditions at night and in the morning. My BP spiked to 180:100 sometimes throughout the day, that is basically when I had my ""anxiety spikes"". But went down to 140:90 afterwards and stayed that on average.

Still the doctor said ""NO!"" and basically made me take the BP medicine for two weeks now. While I felt like total garbage the first 2 weeks on medication, now I only feel like garbage when waking up. I take Candesartan & Lercanidipin (Dont know the international names, maybe you heard of it). Candesartan at night and Lercanidipin in the morning. 

I measured my BP in the morning and before going to bed and its basically between 100:70 to 110:80. I have to drink two cups of coffee to even get started. That by the way brings my BP up to 140:90. 

While I do plan to take the BP Meds until the package is empty, I do not think that I really require the meds. I think there are some people who function better on 140:90, while others function better on 120:80. Im a 30 year old male with perfect health condition, my blood results were top, I am not overweight, I hit the gym 3x a week, go for a walk every day. Its just my mental state that needs a fix, which is what I am in therapy for.

So what is your opinion on the ""120/80 or go home"" take, that my doctor gave me. Like seriously if I always have to drink coffein to get on my ""normal vitals"", I could as well just not take the meds at all.

1kn5vyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1kn5vyq/explore_the_urbanexplorer_carryon_suitcase_review/,Explore the UrbanExplorer carry-on suitcase review is it the best luggage?,"The UrbanExplorer Carry-On Suitcase, model B0DKTLF16T, is a product I used recently for a series of trips, ranging from a short two-day jaunt to a more extended week-long tour. My goal in purchasing this airline-approved carry-on was to replace an older suitcase that didn’t meet today’s travel standards. While my experience with this product has been generally positive, there are certainly some factors to keep in mind before deciding if it’s the right fit for you.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed is its sleek and modern design, coupled with a durable ABS and aluminum frame construction. The hard shell feels resistant to scuffs and scratches, which is a massive plus for anyone (like me) who has witnessed luggage being mercilessly tossed about by airport staff. While it looks great, I’d suggest examining the trim closely because a few users reported the small brads attaching it may not offer sufficient reinforcement. So far, mine has held up without incident, but I’m meticulous with my belongings, which probably helps.

**Functional Features Galore**  
The features on this suitcase truly stood out to me. My favorite by far? The built-in cup holder. I travel frequently with coffee in tow, and this tiny addition is a game-changer when you’re juggling a phone, boarding pass, and a hot latte. In addition, the USB and USB-C ports are excellent for keeping devices charged mid-journey, although you’ll need your own power bank. Another standout feature is the front laptop compartment. It’s incredibly convenient for pulling out a laptop during security checks, and accessing it doesn’t disturb your other packed items. Be mindful if you have a larger laptop—the pocket is designed for devices up to 15.6 inches only.

**Surface Performance and Maneuverability**  
Moving through different surfaces—airport linoleum, outdoor concrete, and even hotel carpets—the 360° spinner wheels rolled effortlessly. Maneuverability often makes or breaks carry-ons, and this one certainly passed the test. There’s also an adjustable telescoping handle with three different height options, which my travel partner appreciated because they’re much taller than I am. The one slight hiccup I noticed is that on rough surfaces like cobblestones, the wheels can feel a little less smooth, but this isn’t unique to this suitcase.

[Check UrbanExplorer B0DKTLF16T price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0dktlf16t/)

**Advantages**  
The merits of this UrbanExplorer suitcase are numerous. Here are just a few:  
- Lightweight yet robust; perfect for overhead bin storage.  
- TSA-approved locks for added security.  
- Thoughtfully designed compartments for laptops and devices.  
- Stylish aesthetics that draw compliments.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
On the downside, there are a few areas where the suitcase could improve:  
- Some buyers reported durability concerns after repeated rough use.  
- The cup holder, while innovative, feels a bit flimsy—avoid using it while actively moving.  
- Trim attachment may not feel as reinforced as pricier competitors.  

**Challengers**  
Having owned several carry-ons, I compared this suitcase to industry leaders like Samsonite or Travelpro. Samsonite’s cases are renowned for their longevity, though you’ll pay significantly more for comparable features. On the other hand, Travelpro tends to cater more toward business travelers and sacrifices some of the UrbanExplorer’s more lifestyle-oriented features like the phone platform and cupholder. UrbanExplorer impressed me by offering luxury-adjacent perks at a far more approachable price point, though its craftsmanship may not match high-end alternatives over years of heavy travel.

**Value Proposition**  
UrbanExplorer’s carry-on sits comfortably in the ""affordable quality"" category. While it may not be the cheapest suitcase out there, it packs an impressive number of features for its cost. I’d say it’s ideal for the casual traveler who appreciates convenience and a modern style without breaking the bank. Those expecting frequent long-haul flights might consider something sturdier for the daily grind.

For anyone aiming to snag their next travel companion on a budget, start your search here and evaluate if this one ticks the right boxes for you.

1kn5vr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1kn5vr2/recently_diagnosed_depressed_and_not_sure_what/,"Recently diagnosed, depressed and not sure what should I now?","My symptoms started about a month ago with bleeding, horrid abdominal pain, and of course, weight loss, the classics. Fortunately, I managed to get diagnosed fairly quickly with UC (Pancolitis, moderate). I'm currently in my first week of treatment with mesalamine (4x a day) + Curcumin/Qing Dai supplement, and it's been working great: my symptoms disappeared almost two days after I started treatment. For the past three days, I’ve been feeling like a normal person again, with normal stools, once a day. Worth mentioning: my calprotectin level was 3000 before diagnosis.

However, on the other side, I’m feeling lost. I’ve been following a super restrictive diet containing only chicken breast, eggs, white toasted bread, and rice. It’s getting to the point where I’d rather not eat than force down the same four ingredients I was told are safe. I’m getting depressed thinking this might be my life from now on. Before this, I was a big fan of going out, eating out, enjoying a glass of wine - Is all that gone forever? Everything I read seems to contradict itself, but diet still appears to play a huge role in managing UC and seems to remain quite restrictive even for people in remission. 

What I’m not sure about is what to do now. From what I understand, remission means calprotectin levels under 50. Does that mean I’m only allowed to eat these 4 ingredients until I hit that number? Only *then* can I start reintroducing foods slowly while keeping a food journal? I’ve read that it can take 4–6 weeks for calprotectin levels to normalize, but that feels like an eternity on this diet. The whole thing is driving me insane. I feel like there’s not much left to enjoy, not even a coffee for the moment.

I’d be really interested to hear your views and experiences. How has your journey been in terms of **diet, alcohol, and getting back to living normally**? How long did it take for your calprotectin to drop? And what did you eat during that phase when clinical symptoms were gone, but the inflammation was still likely present?",2,1747308739.0,UlcerativeColitis,3,1.0,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

[https://www.plantedshack.com/15-cozy-mid-century-modern-living-room-ideas/](https://www.plantedshack.com/15-cozy-mid-century-modern-living-room-ideas/)

  
The Mid-Century Modern design style has gained immense popularity over the years, celebrated for its clean lines, functionality, and effortless charm. This aesthetic, which flourished between the 1930s and 1960s, seamlessly combines form and function, making it a perfect choice for creating a cozy living room. In this article, we will explore 15 delightful Mid-Century Modern living room ideas that can transform your space into a comforting and stylish haven.

  
1. Embrace Organic Shapes

  
Mid-Century Modern furniture often features organic shapes that echo nature. Look for sofas and chairs with curvy outlines and asymmetrical forms.

  
Tip:

  
Choose a low-profile sofa with a rounded back to create a welcoming focal point.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Integrate soft, plush cushions to enhance comfort and warmth.

  
2. Incorporate Earthy Color Palettes

  
Warm, earthy tones like olive green, mustard yellow, and terracotta define the Mid-Century Modern aesthetic. These colors evoke a sense of calm and coziness.

  
Tip:

  
Use accent pillows and throws in these colors to add depth.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Paint your walls in a muted tone and use brighter colors as accents through decor.

  
3. Mix Textures for Visual Interest

  
A cozy living room thrives on texture. Combine various materials like wood, leather, and soft fabrics to create a layered look.

  
Tip:

  
Incorporate a plush area rug to ground the space and add softness underfoot.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Use textured throws and cushions on smooth leather furniture.

  
4. Incorporate Iconic Furniture Pieces

  
Highlight iconic Mid-Century Modern furniture pieces such as Eames chairs or Knoll sofas. These timeless designs serve as a stylish focal point.

  
Tip:

  
Invest in a statement chair that complements your sofa.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Position the iconic piece in a way that it invites conversation.

  
5. Create a Statement Wall

  
A statement wall can significantly enhance the coziness of your living room. Consider incorporating wood paneling or a bold wallpaper design.

  
Tip:

  
Use natural wood panels to add warmth and texture.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Choose a retro-patterned wallpaper that reflects Mid-Century Modern influences.

  
6. Opt for Minimalist Decor

  
Mid-Century Modern design is characterized by minimalism. Keep decor simple yet meaningful to maintain an uncluttered environment.

  
Tip:

  
Select a few statement pieces rather than overcrowding the space.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Use decorative items strategically, placing them on shelves or coffee tables.

  
7. Infuse Nature with Houseplants

  
Indoor plants bring life to your space and are a hallmark of Mid-Century Modern design. They soften hard lines and add a touch of vibrancy.

  
Tip:

  
Use sleek planters that align with the aesthetic.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Place plants in corners or on side tables to create a natural, inviting atmosphere.

  
8. Layered Lighting

  
Lighting is crucial in creating a cozy ambiance. Think about incorporating layered lighting options, including floor lamps, table lamps, and overhead fixtures.

  
Tip:

  
Choose lighting fixtures with geometric shapes or vintage designs.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Use dimmable bulbs to adjust the mood according to your needs.

  
9. Use Large-Scale Art Pieces

  
Art is an excellent way to showcase your personality and enhance the coziness of your living room. Large-scale artwork can create a stunning focal point.

  
Tip:

  
Look for abstract pieces that reflect the Mid-Century vibe.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Hang art at eye level for maximum impact and visual appeal.

  
10. Incorporate Vintage Accessories

  
Accessorize your space with vintage finds that speak to the Mid-Century era. Items like ceramic vases or retro clocks can add character and nostalgia.

  
Tip:

  
Thrift stores and flea markets are excellent sources for vintage decor.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Combine vintage pieces with contemporary items for an eclectic feel.

  
11. Open Up the Space

  
Mid-Century Modern design often emphasizes open spaces. Arrange furniture to facilitate easy flow and conversation.

  
Tip:

  
Use a sectional sofa to create a cozy area without obstructing movement.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Position furniture in a way that encourages social interaction while maintaining openness.

  
12. Invest in Stylish Storage

  
A clutter-free living room is key to achieving Mid-Century Modern coziness. Invest in stylish storage solutions that are both functional and beautiful.

  
Tip:

  
Opt for wooden cabinets with clean lines and minimalist designs.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Use open shelving to display curated items while keeping necessary items tucked away.

  
13. Play with Symmetry

  
Incorporating symmetrical designs can create a sense of balance in your living room, contributing to a cozy yet sophisticated atmosphere.

  
Tip:

  
Arrange furniture in pairs for an inviting look.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Use matching side tables or lamps on either side of a sofa.

  
14. Choose a Functioning Fireplace

  
If you have a fireplace, embrace it as a central feature of your living room. A cozy fire adds warmth and draws people together.

  
Tip:

  
Style the mantel with decorative items that align with Mid-Century Modern aesthetics.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Keep the area around the fireplace clear for a clean, airy feel.

  
15. Personalize the Space

  
Finally, infuse personality into your Mid-Century Modern living room. Personal touches make the space feel inviting and uniquely yours.

  
Tip:

  
Incorporate family photos framed in stylish Mid-Century frames.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
Display souvenirs from travels or favorite books on coffee tables or shelving.

  
Conclusion

  
Creating a cozy Mid-Century Modern living room is about balancing form and function while ensuring that the space reflects your unique style. By embracing organic shapes, earthy colors, and iconic furniture, you can create a warm and inviting atmosphere that encourages relaxation and conversation. With these 15 ideas, you can transform your living room into a Mid-Century Modern retreat that feels both timeless and relevant. Embrace the charm of this design style, and watch as your living space becomes a cozy oasis for friends and family alike!

1kn5jrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kn5jrj/small_dose_and_preheat_with_hario_switch/,Small Dose and Preheat with Hario Switch,"The Coffee Chronicler made a new video answering questions from people. He talked about he likes using only 8g of coffee beans to 130g of water with Switch, so he can try different coffee a day .  

I just tried it and it works well for me! Very pleasant cup. 

Previously my dose is usually 15g of beans to 240g of water. I know it should work well for 12g , 10g, because it’s mostly immersion. But for variables unknown to me , after many attempts, I just thought i needed at least 15g to have a “fuller” cup , but I was wrong. 



I also want to talk about preheat. There are some posts about preheat with Switch on Reddit. 

The Coffee Chronicler never talked about preheat in two of the Hario Switch videos he made. He made a video with a Taiwanese pour over champion, neither did she talk about preheat while making coffee with Switch in that video. 

I use the ceramic version of Switch, which in theory requires even more preheat than the glass version? However,  I am getting decent results without preheat, apart from wetting the filter papers with boiling hot water . 

Another problem is that I don’t believe I am preheating it throughly by pouring water on the brewer, unless I close the switch and let it stay in there for a while, but then I need to fill in most of it . I don’t want to waste that much brewing water. 


I don’t have any theories to share, I encourage everyone to try different things and learn from their own observations. And please try 8g -10g dose on Switch . ",3,1747307569.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

1kn5hqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/seventeen/comments/1kn5hqr/svts_10th_anniversary_special_my_burstday_wish/,"SVT's 10th Anniversary Special: My BURSTDAY wish, and what's yours?","In slightly less than a month, I'll be marking my very first anniversary as a baby Carat. (12 June 2024, exactly 17 days after their 5.26 anniversary last year, was the first time I [fell into this Diamond Life](https://www.reddit.com/r/seventeen/comments/1hk50fz/i_fell_for_svt_and_now_its_nearly_impossible_to/) on Apple Music...) — and what a time to be a Carat!! 💎
  
To have witnessed them conquer the world at Glastonbury 🇬🇧, Lollapalooza 🇩🇪, and Tecate Pa'l Norte 🇲🇽; win double Daesang at MAMA 🏆🏆; perform their last OT13 stage at last year's Caratland; complete a World Tour that saw over 1 million attendees (including [little baby Carat me](https://www.reddit.com/r/seventeen/comments/1igj19t/a_baby_carats_rambling_diary_entry_on_attending/)); and now, right at the threshold of their full 10th year — with a whole new album of solos and crazy collabs?? (Pharrell collab was on my [Christmas Wishing Tree](https://www.reddit.com/r/seventeen/comments/1hlv61y/christmas_wishing_tree_make_your_svt_wish_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) for SVT!!)

They've hinted for a while at the scale of their vision for this ""New Beginning"". The motif of fire 🔥 and the phoenix 🐦‍🔥, the idea of Dare or Death, and now it's clear why this isn't just any other birthday celebration, but a BURSTDAY where their many individualities will burst forth and shine through, even as they stay one in heart and spirit.   
  
It's undoubtedly poignant as I started my military wife life when I saw Jeonghan 👼 go offline last year and then sent Wonwoo 🐈‍⬛ off to his squad commandership... Yet, the theme they have chosen for this enlistment era comeback could not be further from soppy farewells; instead, it rings clearly and audaciously with fresh purpose and renewed conviction. Rather than merely celebrating the past, they have taken it upon themselves to push the limits, to break boundaries, to self-combust in order to be born anew. (As our favourite tiger 🐯 put it, to inflict some real Damage!)  

And there's something about that that speaks profoundly to me. This year, I'll cross the 10-year mark too at my current workplace. For context, I work in an industry where the average shelf life in a given firm is closer to 2-3 years due to the intense stress of servicing clients, dealing with media, and putting out fires (of all metaphorical kinds... and the occasional literal sort). Many have asked why I don't look elsewhere, or if I'm getting too comfortable by staying put. I myself have lost count of the number of times I've asked myself those same questions.  
  
It's easy to look at a long tenure and chalk it up to routine and regularity, but as I stand on the precipice of my own 10th professional anniversary, I realise it's more about the rhythm — the way my team's spirit hums and thrums, tuned to my own heart, in response to the changing challenges that each new day brings. We are not perfect, and we are all very different, but our rhythm of supporting, trusting, and challenging each other pushes us along.

So this year, as I prepare to cross that ten-year mark, I pledge to celebrate my own BURSTDAY not just with gratitude for what has passed and got me here, but also with renewed intent for what comes next. I've long been passionate about culture and the arts — domains I'd struggle to pursue in a financially secure way in Southeast Asia where I'm based — but this year, I'm challenging myself to take up certification and courses so I can better integrate these areas into my career pathway, and forge new possibilities. I've also committed to building new connections in the cultural space (going for coffee chats, events, festivals to meet people), and exploring new ways to inspire my team (been brainstorming with ChatGPT to design a new training programme!).  

It's insane to me how uncanny the timing of everything has been. But somehow in seeing the parallels between my journey and SVT's, I've been able to draw from such a deep well of inspiration, warmth, energy, creativity, and most importantly, sincerity and kindness. 

That they've worked so hard for so long, yet always daring to dream and always together, bringing along all those who are near and dear. And here they are ready to take flight, to propel themselves onto new heights (I cannot even begin to imagine what sort of sonic sparks will fly from those 13 solos!!).

So my BURSTDAY wish is for each and every one of us Carats to BURST forth in our own personal journeys — to embrace the everlasting energy of youth within; to be **many** in our aspirations and causes and communities we serve, yet **one** in our big, bursting love. 🩷🩵

# Understanding Texture in Interior Design

Texture plays a pivotal role in the realm of interior design, serving as a critical component that influences the overall aesthetics and emotional appeal of a space. In this context, texture can be defined as the tactile quality of materials used within an environment, including attributes such as roughness, smoothness, softness, or hardness. Manufacturers and designers routinely utilize varying textures to evoke specific feelings, create visual interest, and enhance the functionality of different areas within a home or commercial setting.

Beyond the physical touch, texture also encompasses visual characteristics that can transform a room's ambiance. This can be observed through patterns and colors that create depth and intrigue. For instance, fabrics with intricate patterns or color gradations can introduce a layered effect, encouraging the eye to explore the space more thoroughly. By understanding how different textures work together, [**Interior designers in Ahmedabad**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-ahmedabad/) can devise innovative solutions that resonate with their clients’ preferences while aligning with contemporary trends.

Incorporating a mix of textures is essential for creating balance and harmony within a room. For example, combining soft textiles with hard surfaces like metal or glass can produce a captivating contrast that adds dimension to interiors. This technique is often leveraged by the best interior designers in Ahmedabad, who articulate a distinctive narrative through their work. Furthermore, luxury interior designers in Ahmedabad frequently highlight the tactile experience by selecting materials that not only appeal visually but also enrich the sensory experience of a space.

Ultimately, mastering texture is crucial for anyone involved in creating compelling interiors. By judiciously employing various textures, from walls to furnishings, one can significantly enhance a room's atmosphere and functionality, thereby elevating everyday experiences. The application of such design principles is a hallmark of the top 10 interior designers in Ahmedabad, making them invaluable resources for both residential and commercial projects.

# The Psychological Impact of Texture

https://preview.redd.it/4w82un2bfx0f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec9d650f3638ba406b783e6d5d4b8757730f8b6b

Texture plays a pivotal role in interior design, significantly influencing the mood and ambiance of a space. By understanding the psychological impact of various textures, one can make informed decisions that enhance the overall experience within a room. Different textures can evoke a range of emotional responses and perceptions, from comfort and warmth to excitement and energy.

Soft textures, such as plush fabrics, velvets, and cushions, often create an atmosphere of comfort and relaxation. These materials can psychologically transport individuals to a state of tranquility, making them ideal for spaces designed for rest and rejuvenation, such as bedrooms and living rooms. The presence of soft textures encourages physical contact, inviting occupants to engage with their surroundings and feel a sense of belonging. This characteristic is particularly advantageous for interior designers in Ahmedabad, aiming to create inviting spaces that foster well-being.

Conversely, hard textures like metal, stone, and glass introduce a sense of strength and durability. These materials often exude a modern and sophisticated vibe, which can invigorate a space and stimulate mental energy. By skillfully incorporating hard textures, one can create environments that encourage productivity and focus, making them ideal for workspaces or contemporary living areas. The best interior designers in Ahmedabad recognize the subtle balance required in effective texture incorporation to foster the desired emotional climate.

Additionally, the interplay between varying textures can enhance spatial perception. For example, combining rough and smooth elements can add depth and interest, creating dynamic contrasts that captivate the viewer's attention. Luxury interior designers in Ahmedabad often utilize this principle to develop visually intriguing spaces that invite exploration. When done correctly, the thoughtful application of texture within interior design can transform an ordinary room into an extraordinary experience, elevating both aesthetics and emotional resonance.

# Types of Textures: A Comprehensive Overview

https://preview.redd.it/zgmr2efcfx0f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19bcf1521ad881aabad43bd9fad82e91dff560f9

In the realm of interior design, texture plays a pivotal role in establishing visual interest and depth within a space. There are two primary categories of textures: tactile textures and visual textures. Understanding these textures is essential for anyone looking to create an aesthetically pleasing environment.

Tactile textures refer to surfaces that can be experienced through touch and can greatly influence the ambiance of a room. This type includes a wide range of materials such as fabrics, finishes, and wall treatments. Examples of tactile textures are soft textiles like velvet and linen, which can create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Smooth surfaces, such as glass or polished wood, impart a sleek and modern feel. Rough textures like exposed brick or stucco add character and can evoke a rustic or industrial vibe. When utilized thoughtfully, tactile textures can create a dynamic interplay between elements in the space, enhancing the overall sensory experience for inhabitants and visitors alike.

On the other hand, visual textures are perceived through sight rather than touch. This category encompasses patterns found in wallpaper, tiles, and artwork. Visual textures can trick the eye into perceiving depth or dimension, which can be particularly beneficial in smaller areas or rooms with low ceilings. For instance, intricate wallpaper patterns may draw attention and provide a focal point, while geometric tiles can lend a modern touch. By carefully selecting visual textures, interior designers in Ahmedabad can dramatically alter the perception of a room’s dimensions and style.

By incorporating both tactile and visual textures, top 10 interior designers in Ahmedabad can skillfully elevate the appeal of spaces, making them not only visually engaging but also inviting to experience. Ultimately, blending these textures contributes to creating a balanced and harmonious interior environment.

# Mixing Textures: Creating Contrast and Harmony

https://preview.redd.it/rbxnsqldfx0f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da6f3b3824ab0e882771dd77d867290de66d9ba4

In the realm of interior design, achieving a captivating visual aesthetic often hinges upon the successful mixing of textures. This technique not only adds depth and interest to a space but also creates a sense of harmony through contrast. Interior designers in Ahmedabad frequently utilize this art, blending various materials to enhance both the functionality and aesthetics of a room.

A fundamental principle in texture mixing is the balance between soft and hard materials. Incorporating plush textiles, such as velvets or soft linens, can soften the rigidity of hard surfaces like wood or metal. For instance, a sleek leather sofa can be beautifully complemented by a fluffy wool or knit throw, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. It is essential to consider the scale and proportion of these elements, ensuring that they work harmoniously without overwhelming the space.

Another important aspect is the interplay of matte and glossy finishes. Matte coatings, often found in natural materials like ceramics or unpolished wood, can tone down the shine of glossy surfaces such as stainless steel or glass. This combination adds dimension to a room, enticing the eye to explore various surfaces. For example, pairing a glossy coffee table with a matte-textured rug can create an intriguing focal point within a living space.

Furthermore, contrasting rough and smooth textures can lead to a visually arresting environment. A rough stone wall juxtaposed with smooth, polished furniture can evoke a sense of balance and sophistication. Successful interior designers in Ahmedabad often take advantage of this technique by incorporating reclaimed wood alongside sleek modern elements, further showcasing the harmony that can be created through varied textures.

By thoughtfully integrating these contrasting textures, one can elevate a space from mundane to extraordinary, creating a layered and dynamic look. The key lies in striking the right balance, ensuring that each element complements rather than competes with the others, ultimately leading to a cohesive design.

# Texture in Color: Enhancing Visual Appeal

https://preview.redd.it/y99elwuefx0f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6769f443cf5c8136c07b31b8adabc207b8f2b38

In interior design, the interplay between texture and color plays a crucial role in creating visually appealing spaces. Different textures can amplify or mute colors, contributing significantly to the overall atmosphere of a room. When carefully combined, they can add depth and interest, transforming a mundane area into a captivating sanctuary. This is particularly relevant for those seeking the expertise of interior designers in Ahmedabad, who can offer tailored solutions for each unique space.

Utilizing a variety of textures alongside color patterns can result in a richer visual experience. For instance, a bold, vibrant hue can be softened by incorporating natural textures such as wood or fabric. Conversely, muted colors can be enhanced through the introduction of high-gloss surfaces or intricate patterns. The [**best interior designers in Ahmedabad**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-ahmedabad/) often recommend creating a balance in texture and color to prevent overwhelming the viewer. By weaving in elements such as smooth ceramics with rough textiles, a designer can establish a harmonious environment that appeals to the senses.

Textures can also evoke different emotions, which can be effectively manipulated through color choices. Warm colors like reds and oranges may be accentuated with soft textiles, creating a welcoming and cozy feel, while cooler tones can be paired with sleek metal finishes for a more modern, tranquil ambiance. As one examines the top 10 interior designers in Ahmedabad, it becomes evident how essential these principles are in their design philosophy. Applying these techniques thoughtfully not only elevates the aesthetic of a space but also enhances its function.

In conclusion, understanding the relationship between texture and color allows for a more profound exploration of design possibilities. By mindfully integrating these elements, one can achieve stunning results in any interior space, proving that a well-balanced approach is key to successful design.

# Choosing the Right Textures for Different Spaces

https://preview.redd.it/08akt35gfx0f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=512e7fb7e71ddc1ec87d3eeada0676a6d3fbb4d5

Texture plays a crucial role in interior design, as it adds depth and character to spaces. When selecting textures, it is essential to consider the function and style of each room. Living areas benefit from a combination of textures that promote comfort and warmth. For instance, plush fabrics such as velvet or chenille for sofas can be paired with sleek metal accents or wood surfaces to create a balanced environment. Textured rugs can further enhance the inviting feel of the space while being visually appealing. Suitable choices here include thick knits or shag rugs that add a tactile element to the floor.

In bedrooms, the goal is often to create a sanctuary that evokes tranquility. Soft textiles such as linen or cotton for bedding contribute to a serene atmosphere. Incorporating textured wall treatments, like a fabric wall covering or decorative plaster, can add visual interest without overwhelming the senses. For a more luxurious touch, consider adding plush throw pillows or a faux fur throw for warmth and depth. These elements also resonate with the offerings of luxury interior designers in Ahmedabad, who emphasize comfort and elegance in their designs.

Kitchens, on the other hand, require textures that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Durable materials such as polished stone countertops can provide a visually appealing contrast to textured wooden cabinetry. Backsplashes with varied surface finishes, such as subway tiles combined with natural stone, can create a captivating focal point. To ensure longevity and ease of maintenance, choose materials that withstand daily use while also aligning with the style of modern interior designs. Finally, bathrooms can benefit from a mix of smooth surfaces, such as glazed tiles, paired with softer materials like cotton towels and bath mats, creating an inviting space for relaxation and self-care.

Overall, through thoughtful selection of textures in each specific area of a home, one can create a cohesive design that reflects personal style and enhances functionality. Engaging the expertise of [**top 10 interior designers in Ahmedabad**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-ahmedabad/) can aid in this creative process, ensuring that each texture complements the overall aesthetic of the space.

# Incorporating Textures Through Furniture and Decor

https://preview.redd.it/tq2oxfuhfx0f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e865843141a16fb67e100c8f3c607fa6a4edb8b

In interior design, the introduction of texture through furniture choices and decorative elements is crucial in creating visually appealing and engaging spaces. Furniture and decor not only provide functionality but also serve as a foundation for establishing depth within a room, making the choice of materials and finishes imperative. Interior designers in Ahmedabad have increasingly focused on this aspect, recognizing the significance of texture in enhancing the overall ambience of a space.

Rugs play a vital role in adding tactile dimensions to a room. A plush area rug can soften hard surfaces and create zones within an open space, while a jute or sisal rug introduces a natural, woven texture that contrasts beautifully with sleek furniture. Cushions and throw pillows offer another straightforward way to incorporate texture, where varying fabrics such as velvet, linen, or faux fur can draw attention and make seating areas more inviting. The careful selection of cushion colors and fabrics can significantly impact the room's atmosphere, which is why the best interior designers in Ahmedabad often recommend mixing different textiles for a layered look.

Curtains and drapes can also enhance textural richness. Heavy, luxurious fabrics can add drama to a space, while lighter, sheer materials can introduce a more casual, airy feel. The layering of curtains, using both sheer and opaque materials, allows for richness and flexibility in light management, essential for creating a multi-dimensional environment. Wall hangings, such as tapestries or fabric art, can further serve as focal points that add both texture and interest to a room.

Finally, the choice of furniture finishes contributes significantly to texture. Opting for furniture with varied surface qualities—such as matte, glossy, or distressed finishes—provides an appealing contrast that enriches user experience. For those seeking luxury interior designers in Ahmedabad, the skillful incorporation of textural elements not only ensures that the design remains functional but also strikes a perfect balance between comfort and sophistication.

# Practical Tips for Adding Texture to Your Space

https://preview.redd.it/y1r2fcojfx0f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db8061fdb4c52718735c10d846c352d1bb89f5b7

Incorporating texture into your interior design can significantly enhance the depth and interest of any space. To begin, consider the principle of layering textures. This involves combining various materials, such as textiles, wood, and metal, which can create a vibrant and dynamic environment. For instance, pairing a soft velvet sofa with a rugged wood coffee table and metal accents can lead to a rich tapestry of textures that captivates the eye.

When aiming for a visually appealing room, focusing on key pieces is essential. Select a few standout items that already possess distinct textures, such as a weaving basket, a textured rug, or an intricately designed wall art piece. These elements can serve as focal points and elevate the overall aesthetic. The top 10 interior designers in Ahmedabad often emphasize the significance of these standout items in their projects, showcasing how they can define a space and guide subsequent design choices.

Another effective way to introduce texture is through the use of natural elements. Incorporating plants is not only a nod to environmental awareness but also adds varying shades of green, soft leaves, and even flowers that can contrast beautifully with harder surfaces. For instance, luxury interior designers in Ahmedabad often use indoor plants to imbue warmth and life into otherwise sterile spaces. Additionally, natural materials like stone, clay, and wood can complement existing design elements and provide a textural contrast that brings a room to life.

Lastly, consider experimenting with finishes. Matte paint on a wall can provide a different feel compared to glossy finishes, while textured wallpapers are another impactful way to create interest. By thoughtfully integrating these elements, anyone can refresh their interiors, making the most of the knowledge shared by the best interior designers in Ahmedabad while achieving a sophisticated and inviting environment.

# Conclusion: The Transformative Power of Texture

In the realm of interior design, texture serves as a critical component that can significantly enhance the overall aesthetic and atmosphere of a space. The incorporation of various textures not only adds depth but also invites a tactile experience, making environments more engaging and inviting. Texture can transform ordinary spaces into extraordinary ones, creating an atmosphere that resonates with personal style and individuality.

Interior designers in Ahmedabad understand the vital role that texture plays in shaping the visual narrative of a room. From the soft, inviting feel of plush textiles to the rugged, earthy appeal of natural materials, each texture contributes to the sensory experience within a space. The best interior designers in Ahmedabad often emphasize the importance of layering different textures to create a harmonious balance. This technique highlights the beauty of contrasts, where soft surfaces can play against more rigid elements, resulting in a rich, dynamic environment.

Moreover, the top 10 interior designers in Ahmedabad are adept at employing texture strategically to guide the viewer’s eye and evoke specific emotions. Whether aiming for a cozy, intimate setting or a sleek, modern ambiance, the effective use of texture can influence how spaces feel and function. [**Luxury interior designers in Ahmedabad**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-ahmedabad/) specialize in this art, meticulously curating textures to elevate a design and impart a sense of sophistication and comfort. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to not only appreciate but also experiment with textures in their designs, as this exploration can yield transformative results.

She constantly put herself under pressure to manage everything — from picking the restaurant, calling the cab, choosing the mountain to hike, to even fetching the pizza. Not because she *had* to. But because she *wanted* to be part of everything. I get it now — it’s not about control for her, it’s about her identity being tied to doing everything right. But it made her anxious, and that anxiety spread to everyone around her, including me.

At first, I admired her initiative. But over time, I noticed how little space there was for me. She didn’t trust people to take care of simple things. If I cooked, she’d take over. If I parked the car, she’d jump in with directions. Even when I picked up coffee, she questioned the place I chose, and both were the same chain.

It was like I couldn’t get anything right, and eventually, I started questioning myself.

Only now do I realize this pattern is why her exes felt criticized. She never directly insulted me — she didn’t need to. The constant “fixing” made me feel incapable. I don’t think she did it on purpose. It’s just… how she operates. But that doesn't make it hurt less.

The weirdest part? I asked the universe for a sign — a black scorpion, if I was on the wrong path. After a sauna session, I stepped outside, and the guy sitting next to me had a black scorpion tattoo on his arm.

In that moment, I remembered the **fable of the frog and the scorpion**. She told me early on who she was — about her work, her struggles with expressing feelings, and her challenges. I just didn’t realize how literally it would play out. I kept hoping love and patience would change things. But now I see — she won’t change. Not because she’s malicious. But because she doesn’t even see what she’s doing.

1kn59ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Movavi_software/comments/1kn59ex/compress_video_for_email_with_me/,Compress video for email with me!,"Hey guys. I mostly use social media dms for communication, but I recently stumbled upon an email video restriction (there’s 25mb file size limit), and thought I might share some tips on how to compress a video for email.

I was trying to send my vid via gmail, but I hear other mails have inbox limits, so it doesn’t matter what you’re using, you might find this useful.

Apart from file size limitations, you might want to compress videos for emails because smaller files load and start faster, so it’s not even just good for emails. Moreover, oversized attachments trip spam filters and sometimes get auto-deleted. We don’t want that, do we?

Since we’re all in the Movavi subreddit, I think it’s no surprise that I’m gonna talk about using Movavi Video Converter for compression. Here’s a quick guide on how it works in the software:

* Launch Movavi Video Converter and drag your video there.
* Choose a friendly format. MP4 is the best option here, this format loads well, isn’t as heavy as some other ones, but keeps the quality together.
* Click Compress file next to your clip in the list. A little pop-up gives you a File Size slider. Drag until you’re just under target and make sure the quality stays at least on good (the higher quality you can afford, the better).

https://preview.redd.it/eurv7k47fx0f1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=a89dcd935f076198fff448908eadd6af62e7b712

* Hit Convert sample to see what your video will look like quality-wise. Movavi Video Converter crunches a small snippet so you can check for anything weird. You may also adjust the bitrate as you wish (the higher the bitrate, the better the quality, but the larger the file)
* Click Apply, then Convert, grab coffee, done. With hardware acceleration on (Settings - Preferences - Performance → tick Intel or NVIDIA) it’s faster than rendering a TikTok meme.

A couple of lifehacks:

If your video has any parts/scenes that you don’t need, you may trim it in a video editor first to save some precious space even more. Less footage = fewer bits to squeeze.

Nobody needs 4K vids in an email. Dropping from 2160p to 720p slashes 70–80% of the payload with near-zero complaints.

If everything else fails, upload to Google Drive, set the link to “Anyone can view,” and paste that URL. It never bounces, even if it feels like cheating.

Hope that helps. Drop your own tips or horror stories below – always keen to swap experiences. And if you’ve got any questions, feel free to ask me.

So we’ve had many arguments etc over the past 4 months, and he lives a 45min drive from me, he has a car that he shares with his mum because he lives at home and currently also has no job. Also because he has no job that means he can’t come see me anymore because he’s got no money for petrol because he has no job obviously, and it’s almost been 4 weeks since I seen him last. For some more context, before the beginning of our relationship I stated to him that I was afraid to get into another relationship because my previous ones have really sucked. But he assured me he wouldn’t let me down etc and he would treat me so much better (ik they always say that) and quite literally on our very first date we took a long walk in a park near me and then we ended up walking back to his car and I was afraid to get into, not because you know stranger danger but I felt like if I got into the car then that would be like me getting into a messy relationship all over again and I just wasn’t up for that. But i finally did end up getting in the car on that date, then he asked me to be his valentine and got me a whole new book series that I had mentioned briefly before, flowers, a oodie thingy and some perfume, clearly wanted to treat me or something. It’s clear to me that his love language is gift giving, and that’s perfectly fine but it really isn’t mine, like I obviously appreciate everything he’s gotten me etc but my love languages are quality time and acts of service. So, the first week we started dating it was great, he drove to see me almost everyday, took me on drives, bought me so much stuff, spent time with me etc. Some may say he was love bombing me. I’m not sure. It was all great nonetheless, he used to literally call me 24/7 even though I didn’t really like being on the phone so much because I like to have my own time etc, but I then ended up enjoying it so much more than expected. Then we started fighting over silly things, we would fight until 2am or whatever, the next day for example he would have work to go to but he would refuse to go because we “were fighting” and to me it seems like he just didn’t want to work and just used that as an excuse but whatever. He then got another job, worked there for like maybe 2ish weeks and then we had another massive fight and he didn’t go to work for the entire week because we were fighting that entire time. He got lucky and they offered to give him another chance at the job if he promised to be in on time for his next shift etc. (Spoiler alert he couldn’t do that) we were somewhat fine the day before his shift, then something started up again the night before and then he went to sleep late. I text him the next morning around 7am which is the time he was supposed to start his shift, I don’t get a reply until 8ish, I don’t think much of it at first but then I find out he apparently “slept in” so that was the job gone once again, he’s been “looking” ever since and literally had 2 job interviews to go to but he turned them down for god knows why. Then he finally went to a job interview at a bar and they loved him, told him to come in the next day for a trial shift just to see how it goes. Obviously we were once again fighting over something so he used that as an excuse not to go and until today he still hasn’t bothered to find a job. Also this is the same man who immediately started sharing his location with me so my mind would be at ease, he also met my parents, everything was going great even the first month, then he stopped coming to see me.
We also had one really big fight one time where I sent him a risky picture while he was in a mood just to cheer him up but he just saved it onto his phone (he’s strange and saves like every single photo I send him), later I really regretted sending it to him so I begged him to delete it, quite literally was crashing out, screaming, crying, begging and he just calmly ignored it and kept saying no that I’m all his etc. Also to state he is very controlling, I can’t mention another guy’s name without him getting annoyed. 
For some context about me, I am currently studying and am going to university in September and I don’t have a car, I do have a license but because I don’t have a job because it’s just too difficult for me to keep both a job and study because I end up getting hyperfixated on one thing then slack off in the other etc. So I can’t go to see him, maybe I could get the train but once again I don’t have a job (I am looking for one but I don’t have much experience so don’t have a lot of luck either, literally had a job interview not long ago and they rejected me). 
He also has a great relationship with his mum, which is great but sometimes I feel like it’s a bit too much, like he’ll literally go and get coffee with his mum ever. Single. Day. And I might be dramatic but I feel like if you don’t have a job or the money to pay for the coffee then you shouldn’t be going out for coffee so much etc when you can’t even pay for it? ( might just be my perspective on it) or most days he’s out shopping with her for hours upon hours, I’m not sure if they just like the company but it’s whatever, it kinda hurts because sometimes I felt like he would prefer to go out with his mum over me. 
He also just doesn’t know how to admit when he’s wrong and apologise. And now we’ve been arguing for the past like 2 weeks and I’m getting so sick of it, I’m mentally exhausted from it all. 
I am also an art student and I’m having an art exhibition for my work tonight, I obviously invited him like as soon as I found out about it, but then a couple days ago I thought I had to be there for the whole like 3 hours but it turns out I just need to pop in and say hi and that’s really it. So I said to him that he can come if he wants to my exhibition but I felt like there isn’t much of a point to him driving like over an hour to my exhibition for 20mins, so I said since it’s lovely weather why don’t he come down tomorrow and we can have a nice day out instead of 20mins, he started acting like I didn’t want him there, that’s obviously not the case I was just looking out for him especially since he has no job or money rn. And said that we’ll see about my exhibition or the nice day out. That was last week nothing has been mentioned about it since and I’ve no idea if I’ll see him at my exhibition but my guess is I won’t.
This man also hates my best friend for no reason, well for some context one time I was ranting about her and just something small that had bothered, in no way was I talking shit about her but just wanted to express my feelings about something in comfort of my boyfriend that I thought I could trust. Turns out the next time him and I fought he would find a way to bring her into the fight which btw had nothing to do with her, and throw everything I said to him back in my face and maybe in a way to put the blame on her instead. Since then he betrayed my trust and I don’t talk anything about her to him anymore.

Also this fight I’m pretty sure had started off because I watch this guy called Leo skepi, which if you don’t know who that is, he’s basically a funny, sarcastic, gay, bald man who’s just very entertaining to watch, and he also gives great advice about not letting anyone put you down etc. And my partner hates him. Never has he fully given me a reason why, maybe it’s because he’s a guy idk, but he had attempted to try and make me completely stop watching him, I said no because that’s like trying to stop something that I enjoy and that brings me joy, I would never stop him from watching something he enjoys because in my mind if that makes him happy then why not. So my parent continued calling Leo a “shitbag” and trying to call him every name under the sun and it hurt me because I don’t shit on the stuff he likes, some times my bf will try to get me watch the stuff he likes but unfortunately I don’t enjoy so I say to him that I’m glad he enjoys it but I’m not the target audience for it and that’s it. 

Yesterday because it’s been like 20+ °C weather it’s been decently warm so I decided to wear biker shorts to go into college because I was obviously really warm and then he started stating how I was doing it just to spite him and so that everyone would be staring at my ass apparently which is ridiculous, im already very self conscious so I definitely wouldn’t ever do that but he keeps talking to me like that. 

Also for one of my classes I need to take a few pictures of stuff and I meant to send it to my friend because she needed it but I accidentally sent it to him and then quickly deleted it, he then noticed it and proceeded to ask me what it was and I just told him short n sweet that it was meant for my friend (who’s a girl btw) and it’s abt my class and then he kept trying to get me to prove it. I never give him a reason not to believe in what I say so I said no, and then he started accusing me of cheating. He does that a lot if I don’t reply quickly or it shows that im active on social media and don’t respond to him then he immediately starts saying “who’s the guy you’re talking too then” when he is literally the only guy on my socials that I talk too and I don’t add back guys that I don’t know.
The fact that this is all in the space of 4 months is crazy to me.
Also I’ve tried to plead with him because he randomly started being too busy to talk to me, like I mentioned he used to call me 24/7, I now couldn’t tell you when the last time I was on the phone to him actually was. I feel like he’s fully stopped putting in any effort, like he’s become completely lazy in the relationship, like he doesn’t even compliment me anymore, kind of feels like he’s just not the same person he was, and maybe it’s just the “honeymoon” phase is over and this is the real him, it’s just strange how he’s done a full 180° and completely changed. He used to spam call me to make sure I was okay etc but now nothing, he ignores everything I say and says how I should just “let us be perfect and happy” but how can I when I feel like I’m drowning in my own relationship? Like I’m not happy anymore. This guy has also came down to surprise me on those shitty days I had.

I’ve decided to mentally give him this week to see if he’ll actually come down to see me and put in the effort. And I’m thinking of finally ending it but I’m afraid because he’s also a very sensitive guy and I don’t want to get upset him but I’ve really been trying to keep myself happy above all else (clearly not) so I don’t know.  Do I Give him more chances?

**Things to consider before buying Air Mattress Best for Camping:**

* Weight and pack size—depends if you're car camping or hiking in.
* Pump type (manual vs. built-in vs. electric).
* Durability—look for tough materials like PVC or TPU and reinforced seams.

**Pro tip:** Always test your mattress before your trip, and bring a patch kit just in case. Also, don’t forget a tarp or footprint to protect it from sticks and sharp rocks.

Take a break for coffee and let's find out what's been happening in marketing these days.

**Search** 

* **New data shows Google keeps users on its site longer**

A 13-month study by Momentic reveals that users now click around 10 times within Google before exiting to another website. This behavior suggests users are spending more time within the platform—refining searches, clicking on various links, and exploring multiple results.

While Google still drives the most traffic overall, it’s not as effective at pushing users off-platform. In contrast, ChatGPT users are more than twice as likely to click through to external sites during a single session. This growing trend may reshape how websites gain visibility.

* **Google clarifies limitations of time-based search operators**

Google’s Search Liaison recently confirmed that the *before:* and *after:* operators are still in beta. These filters only work with specific date formats—either *YYYY* or *YYYY-MM-DD*.

Example queries:

* *avengers endgame before:2019*
* *avengers endgame after:2019-04-01*

For an easier approach, users can navigate to Tools > Any Time > Custom Range within Google Search. This provides a more user-friendly method of filtering results by date, without relying on precise query formatting.

* **Google tightens rater guidelines to target fake EEAT signals**

Google’s updated Search Quality Rater Guidelines now offer clearer instructions for identifying deceptive EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) content signals. The new guidance calls out content that falsely boosts credibility through:

* Fake physical presence (e.g., claiming to have a storefront using fabricated photos or addresses)
* AI-generated or fictitious author bios designed to appear human
* Misrepresented credentials or false claims of subject matter expertise

The update also covers misleading design tactics—such as deceptive buttons or clickbait titles that don’t match the page content.

**Tech SEO**

* **Google’s AI crawler can now render JavaScript like Googlebot**

Google has confirmed that its AI crawler—Google-Extended—can now render JavaScript using the same Web Rendering Service as Googlebot.

This means AI systems can now access and interpret content generated or modified by JavaScript, giving them similar visibility into modern, dynamic websites.

*For SEOs and developers, this underscores the growing need to ensure JS-rendered content is crawlable and meaningful.*

**Google is testing AI Overviews in more places across search**

* **AI in “site:” search commands**

Some users have reported AI Overviews appearing for site: search queries. In at least one case, an overview incorrectly claimed a site lacked content on a topic—despite clear evidence to the contrary.

* **Replacing the local map pack**

Google is also testing AI-generated overviews in place of the traditional local map pack for “near me” queries. Instead of showing a map and business listings, users are seeing summarized local information in the AI Overview format.

1kn509g,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1kn509g/new_tenant_is_completely_insane/,New tenant is completely insane,"I found someone who I will refer to as “E” to rent the spare room in my house for three months to save some money. He says he is “easy” and “clean” but is anything but. He is completely insane.

At first, he told me he had another rental so I was under the impression that he would be gradually moving in. Nope. May 1st, he showed up with his entire family to move in his minimal belongings that could fit into a suitcase. 

E didn’t have one cup or plate of his own when he moved in. He made me a cup of coffee with one of my mugs but didn’t tell me it was for me and just left it outside in the rain for an entire day. So I had to tell him to use his own stuff.

His solution was to buy an enormous stack of paper plates. I have never lived with someone so lazy.

He is extremely wasteful. Does laundry every other day for no reason. Didn’t know how to use a washing machine. Couldn’t open the front door himself.

He has an overpowering bad smell about him that makes me gag. It’s like patchouli and must.

He waits by his door until any time I enter the house or come out of my room to bombard me with nonsense. He repeats himself and is misogynistic. I will have my back turned to him and he will have a conversation with the back of my head.

He goes through my stuff, rearranges it, and calls it “cleaning”. It’s so invasive to go through someone else’s personal belongings. 

When I set clear boundaries with him and told him to get out of my face and give me personal space, he laughed at me and said that’s just how he is.

I already tried kicking him out early by telling him my cousin needed a place and I would not be renewing with him. And if he found a place I would refund his rent. 

He had the audacity to ask me to find him a place bc he said I have more “resources” to find a place than him even though I have less family, less time, and am less familiar with the area than him bc he is from here. He’s lazy and creepy and full of bullshit. He could easily find another place the same way he found this one. 

The level of helplessness is despicable. Clearly, his mommy has done everything for him his entire life.

I want to punch him in the fucking face. Am I the asshole or valid for hating his guts?

1kn505l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1kn505l/lulutox_tea_review_does_detox_tea_actually_help/,"Lulutox Tea review: Does detox tea actually help with weight loss, bloating, and energy?","I’ve always been one of those people who side-eyes anything labeled “detox.” I’ve tried a few teas in the past that did nothing... or worse, had me running to the bathroom all day. So when I started seeing more and more mentions of **Lulutox Tea**, I figured I’d do my due diligence and try it *consistently* before judging.

I used **Lulutox detox tea** every day for six weeks and took notes along the way. I wasn’t looking for miracles. I just wanted to see if this stuff would actually help with **bloating, digestion, low energy**, and maybe support some **weight loss**. If you’re looking for a **Lulutox tea review** that’s not a sales pitch, here’s the full breakdown.

**Why I Tried Lulutox Tea in the First Place**

I work from home and sit way too much, even though I try to stay active. The problem for me was always that “weird heaviness” in my gut. Even when I ate clean, I felt bloated and puffy by late afternoon. I wasn’t sleeping great and always needed that second cup of coffee by 2 pm.

I saw **Lulutox tea** pop up in a Reddit thread and started digging deeper. What caught my eye wasn’t people talking about crazy weight loss. It was people saying they felt lighter, had better digestion, and didn’t feel wiped out halfway through the day.

That sounded way more realistic, so I gave it a shot.

**What’s Actually in Lulutox Detox Tea?**

I’ve tried teas before that were basically flavored water. This one was different. The **Lulutox tea ingredients** list was probably the main reason I hit “order.”

It’s got 13 ingredients, most of which I already knew were used in traditional medicine:

* **Matcha Green Tea** – metabolism support
* **Yerba Mate & Guarana** – clean energy, no jitters
* **Oolong & Sencha Green Tea** – antioxidant-rich and smooth
* **Dandelion Leaf & Milk Thistle** – thought to support liver function
* **Ginseng, Goji Berries, Lemongrass, Nettle Leaf** – gut support and calming benefits
* **Stevia Leaf** – mild sweetness, no sugar or calories

It’s **vegan**, **gluten-free**, **soy-free**, and has about 18mg of caffeine per bag, which is significantly less than a cup of coffee. You won’t feel wired, but you’ll feel awake.

**What Happened Over Six Weeks of Drinking It**

**Week 1–2:**  
Bloating went down noticeably. I didn’t expect anything right away, but by the end of week one, my stomach didn’t feel so tight after meals. My clothes fit better and I wasn’t constantly shifting around from discomfort.

**Week 3–4:**  
My **energy was more consistent**. I started skipping my second cup of coffee without even realizing it. I was sleeping better too, which I think was connected. I was also going to the bathroom more regularly without any harsh effects.

**Week 5–6:**  
By now, I’d lost about 4.5 pounds. Not from the tea alone—I was walking and eating balanced meals—but I think the tea helped keep my cravings in check. I wasn’t reaching for snacks in the afternoon and didn’t feel as “puffy” all the time.

**What Detox Tea** ***Doesn't*** **Do**

This part is important: **Lulutox detox tea does it work?** Yes, in a supportive way. It didn’t melt fat off my body or flush everything out overnight. It helped me feel lighter, eat better, and keep a consistent rhythm going. But it’s not magic.

Also worth noting: I didn’t experience any **Lulutox tea side effects**. No cramping, no emergencies, no issues. Just make sure to stay hydrated. It is still tea, after all, and that can be a bit drying if you’re not drinking enough water.

**Where to Buy Lulutox Tea (Watch for Knockoffs)**

I ordered from the [**official site here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) because I saw fake versions floating around online.

Here’s a [**backup link with the same deal**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) in case the first one doesn’t load. They were running a 70% off promo when I ordered.

**Final Thoughts: Is Lulutox Tea Worth Trying?**

If you’re looking for a quick fix, this isn’t it. But if you want something natural to help with **bloating**, **digestion**, **energy**, and gentle support while you're working on healthier habits, **Lulutox tea** might be worth a try.

I kept my expectations realistic and was pleasantly surprised. I’ll definitely keep using it.

If you’ve tried it, I’d love to hear what your experience was like. Did you notice fewer cravings? Any **Lulutox detox tea side effects** I didn’t run into? Or if you’ve tried other teas and want to compare notes, I’m all ears.",1,1747305517.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

Long post, bear with me...

Lads and lassies, I hope you're doing great, and remember, never give up. M(26) here struggling to get over someone even after telling myself countless times and being abudantly aware that she is not for me. How do you lot do it? Mniambie because I am being used like Nivea body lotion in the hands of a boarding high school boy...

I posted a story some while back, I think on the Nairobi subreddit, about someone, who yanked my brains and ghosted me like it meant nothing (I thought men can be cold, women are heartless) So I was casually enjoying my Tuesday evening extended to Wednesday wee hours, with some home made cocktail seeing that I won't be working for the rest of the week. I can't sleep, so It's only fair I unwind because my work is sooooo sweaty and draining (I work Remotely)

I get a call from the damsel causing distress at around 2AM, and when I see her number, my brain completely stops functioning. I answer cause why not, maybe she is in trouble? After months of no contact, she hits me with the softest, most feminine, ""Hey."" Knees were weak, uncle kwaju was excited, but my mind was shouting, ""Whatever it is she wants, DO NOT DO IT.""

She tells me she's in Nakuru, at a club (Space, kwa wale wanaijua), and she was hoping to see me before leaving in the morning. Asks if she can come over, I tell her okay, and I give her directions to my new place (I moved out from where we last messed around) I also have a guest room now, so my head is fully convinced we will not share a bed (The lies we tell ourselves sometimes, 😂)


She gets here, we continue drinking, chatting, and then I hit her with the big question, ""Why did you ghost?"" 

At her big age, she's older than me btw, had the cojones to say, ""Uko too intense and in your feelings. Umeishi kuniambia vile unanitaka, I like you but I just want to have fun. Kwani lazima udate mtu ndio umdinye?""


I just shook my head nikijiambia enyewe anaku easy, let me go sleep kabla sijaanza kumpigia magoti nikisema ""try me I won't disappoint you."" Simp at his best. I told her where the spare room was, asked her when she wanted to wake up, set my alarm and told her goodnight. She seemed surprised I was going to sleep all so suddenly, ""Kwani nimekukosea kababa, nikupee ninii?"" I just smiled, walked away and closed the living room door.

Woman followed me to my room shortly after, mind you I am tipsy, so the sleep was just kicking in. I hear her, so I wake up and ask what she's doing in my room, she fell on me, started messing with my weak spots, and shoved her tongue down my throat. I beg her to stop, I tell her shouldn't do it, I'm not comfortable, her chest is all over my face. I struggled sooo much not to give in, and I succeeded. I pushed her away, left her on my bed, and closed myself inside the washroom.

Surprisingly she was too tired and drunk to follow. 10 mins later nilimpata alizimia hapo, I tucked her in, Mimi nikaenda living room to play some Warzone. I couldn't sleep at all because... you know.

Morning came, 8AM ameamka, I made her breakfast, and an Irish coffee for the hangover. We chatted for a bit, nothing about the previous night, I called her an Uber imrudishe Nairobi. When bidding each other goodbye naambiwa ""Utanitafuta tu, jua ukona deni yangu,""


Sadly, she is right, I can't stop thinking about her, but I don't want to be used, I want love...

He was a business owner as am I, and talked a lot about money, and stuff like the type of apartment he owns etc. I have a work trip coming up, and just reserved the flights, and let him know I’ll be gone during that time. 

The dude insisted on knowing the airline, and I showed him the details (obv nothing that would be a privacy issue like the exact time of the flight, number, etc). As the flights are tax deductible, I decided to book first class, as it’s not an issue for me.

When he saw it he insisted that he almost exclusively travels first class and how it’s small money, doesn’t really make a difference, he’s so used to it and can’t remember a time he flew economy. All in all, he was a quite…. Annoyed at me?
