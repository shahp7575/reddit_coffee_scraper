1kevuko,https://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1kevuko/take_a_moment_to_appreciate_a_cup_of_tea/,Take a moment to appreciate a cup of tea,"Last night, my 11wk old son cried for 3hrs straight. Two hours in, after cuddling, rocking, feeding, reading, music and a nappy change, I just wanted to sit down and have a warm cup of tea. 

My husband made me a cup, but I didn’t have the chance to enjoy as it took another hour of cuddling, rocking and feeding to get my son to sleep. I was at the end of tether by the time he went down and was so upset that I couldn’t even enjoy a warm drink anymore. 

This evening I really took sometime to reflect on last night and have come to one conclusion: I took a moment for a cup of tea for granted before having a child. 

I always drank tea and coffee, sure, but never took 5 minutes to just sit and enjoy it; and I long for just a couple of minutes of peace to sit and enjoy a cup of tea. 

Whatever you’re going through at the moment (and let’s face it, we are all busy to some degree in this chaotic world) if you can stop for 5 minutes to just drink a cup of tea, coffee, hot chocolate, you name it, you have it a lot better than some. 

When you have your next hot drink, please take a minute and appreciate a few sips of it before you move on with your day. Thank you for taking the time to read.",3,1746396570.0,simpleliving,0,1.0,False

Anyone Else Dealing with Nausea, Diarrhea and Headaches?","Greeting fellow sufferers! I started Otezla (apremilast) nearly two months back. First month was not terrific. Now I'm in a groove more or less. I FINALLY figured out how to time my meds with eating and fitness. I get headaches 2x/day, nausea around bedtime (well after the 1hour past taking the meds), and diarrhea is a family friend now.

Have any of you been through this, or going through this now? What has helped you? Has anyone figured out how to mitigate the headaches? BTW, coffee does NOT kill the headaches.

Last month I had a lot of flareups. If I scratch myself, presto! I get rashes and new places to apply my Clobetasol! I still have to treat the major patches. 

Does this get better?

Do the headaches lessen?

How long until you see results?

Will I have to keep applying Clobetasol?",1,1746396560.0,Psoriasis,1,1.0,False

1.The Stewart family is still in Hawaii this week… and still heavily exploiting their overworked kids. They went out on a boat for a snorkeling adventure that Carlin quickly turned into a reel and an IG story where she continues to link anything they touch.  Layla is in charge of the voice over work and we see that Zade is a stronger swimmer than big sis.  The kids are suddenly throwing up the “hang loose” sign and Carlin says a “local” taught them how to do it.  The family takes to their rental car for a trip to the aquarium and while Carlin narrates, Layla is in the backseat looking absolutely miserable.  Obviously daddy’s editing skills are on vacation because several times we have seen her looking less than perfect.  As soon as they hit the aquarium and the big camera comes out, Layla turns on the charm.  Zade is still struggling to communicate and Carlin hits a new low when she captions the post “Me want to see that so much”.  Further proof that the Stewarts are aware of the problem and find it funny.  In a grid post featuring herself, Carlin says they don’t know the gender and asks for guesses.  She’s on the beach, dressed to the 9s… not a BSB fit to be found.  During this trip, everything is linked through her “Like To Know” so that she can earn a commission, and just like many other Bates, she is mostly wearing H&M.  Someone asks about her Canon camera and she says she got it for $400, but it’s now $1500.  Carlin blames the price increase on the camera’s popularity and never mention the word “tariffs”. The Stew Crew definitely has tons of disposable income these days… but they also have disposable brain cells.  Evan gets them lost while they try to take a drive on the Road to Hana.  He fully admits that he just told the GPS to take him to Hana, and it did…. They were 50 miles in before they realized their mistake.  The kids are miserable and Carlin is car sick so they stop for cinnamon rolls, which seems like just the thing to fix all of that.  By the time they retrace their steps, and start over, everyone is over it and they abandon the mission.  They do manage a few pictures in their all beige outfits and Carlin gets to show off her $500 sunglasses.  They head down to the beach for yet another photo shoot and as soon as the camera red light comes on, but Zade and Layla start posing.  It is so odd to watch them perform like little trained actors.  Carlin shoots beach footage and in the background Zade is walking around while Evan shoves the camera in his face and walks backwards so he doesn’t miss one little marketable thing.  Layla gets subtitles for everything she says which is mostly “I’m so ‘scited”, “this is amazing”, “I love you mommy”.  Soon enough the week long content collection is over and it’s time to head to the next island to meet Evan’s family.  Of course they set up the camera in the airport, line themselves and the kids up, and walk past it to signal “leaving”.  Just imagine if you happened to walk up on that mess.  While they travel, Carlin drops prerecorded content that she filmed in her hotel room showing how she unbraided her hair and it became wavy.  Magic, really.  She says people asked her about this, and people also wanted to know how she got her hair to smell so good.  I guess there is some smell-a-vision social media that I don’t know about now?  Of course this is all just to sell more crap because the selling never, ever stops.  Evan’s family has rented a large house and there are 20 people total on this trip.  They head to Costco where Evan films them eating pizza and hot dogs and brags that it all cost him just $11.  We know that Evan’s family has put their foot down about the random filming, so Carlin is forced to switch to pictures only while with them.  She’s still using AI to caption all of this and the fact that everything starts with “….there’s just something about….” Is a dead giveaway. Evan and his brother swim in the ocean shirtless and Ethan definitely thinks he is Dylan Efron. Carlin links an Amazon dress that is cheaper than anything she sells at her own boutique, and creates a reel of Zade in the water with her… shirtless.  Posts and reels about the trip begin to perform poorly with less and less comments and shares on each one.  Their usual Saturday vlog is late, but Evan says it’s on the way and it’s one of his favorite ones to date.  Carlin shows up in an ad for Josie’s shop, taking her hair out of the pool noodle curlers.  This means Carlin has a newer ad on the shop’s page than Josie has herself.


 
2.Katie and Travis Clark are in a content rut. After the big numbers they pulled from Harvey’s birth, and the new house….things have slowed down and they don’t seem to have much going on.  Katie does build a unit for toys and poses Hailey front and center while she puts it all together.  She links everything and shows she got her inspiration from a home design page called “The Neutral Home”…. You don’t say.  The unit all together is over $600.  Katie links every toy she places on the shelf in case you didn’t know to use Amazon or Target for toys.  Baby Harvey is very close to crawling and Hailey finally received some mess free markers.  Katie shows off more bland/boring/beige decorations in the house and it’s pretty clear that Hailey is drawing on walls because she needs some dang color in her life.  Instead, she gets to watch her mom unbox and set up a fake olive tree in a beige pot. In the weekly vlog they are back to pushing powdered supplements and Katie says Gil comes by to pick up the free powder all of the time.  Most of the vlog is a rerun of Katie’s trip to NJ for her sister-in-law’s baby shower.  She borrows a brand new dress from Josie and tells the camera that she will try to film some while she is away but she just doesn’t like to do it as much as Travis does.  Just a little reminder that Katie might not be on social media at all if it wasn’t for Travis, who is definitely hungry for the limelight.  Travis now has a blackstone flat top in the backyard so we can also watch while the Clarks eat nothing but red meat.  While Kaite is away, Travis says he and Harvey were in a minor car accident that was not his fault.  They exploit their infant by telling us all of his medical issues and showing him at the actual doctor.  Harvey often has purple hands and feet, so much that folks have messaged them about it.  Couple that with Travis’ dad’s heart condition, and the baby needs to see a cardiologist.  He tests negative for having a bicuspid valve and the doctor isn’t concerned about the purple color of his extremities and says he will grow out of it.  They end the vlog by showing off Hailey’s new Grandma Core big girl bedroom.  Katie has attempted a vintage feel, but it reads more haunted house with the child’s ultrasound pictures hung on the wall in heavy, old fashioned gold frames.  There are shelfs so high she can never reach them and a vase with fake flowers on the night stand… exactly what every 2 year old needs and wants.  The vlog is 17 minutes long but has 6 ad breaks. Katie reposts everything about the cardiologist visit on IG, saying it was “today” when in reality it was more than a week ago.  Double the exploitation is double the cash according to these folks.  The new bedroom for Hailey is also turned into a reel with a healthy debate in the comments on whether or not the bedroom is fitting for a toddler.  Most people hate the creepy ultrasound pictures.  Warden deserves a shout out bc he is featured more than Travis during this room makeover.  It looks like he and Katie did everything while Travis just filmed.  Typical.  The Clarks wrap up the week in Pinehurst, NC visiting their friends the Potter family again.  We see them at a plant nursery, a golf course and out to dinner.  Katie posts a fake question about her plain old denim shorts so she can get her link quota in.  She also shares all of the links to everything in Hailey’s bedroom.



 
3.After dropping her pregnancy announcement, Josie Balka almost took the week off.  She pins the reel announcing the pregnancy on IG and TikTok and sits back to see how well it performs.  It gets about half of the engagement that Carlin’s announcement received, so Josie must be steaming.  She shows up to put makeup on in the car… and it’s a full face of makeup complete with contouring and concealing.  This makeup is over $100 for just the foundation and concealer but she says you really need it… even though for the last few months she said you only needed a tinted moisturizer.  We also get to watch her film herself have her hair washed and trimmed.  Josie could be suffering from morning sickness, or just busy building her McMansion. If she really wants to pull in the numbers, she will share the building of the home bc according to Katie, that brings in the revenue.


 
 
4.Alyssa Webster took the unprecedented move this week to wish her baby sister, and best babysitter, Ellie Bates, a public Happy Birthday.  She even says “I Love You” and features several pictures of Ellie with the fam.  Alyssa hasn’t done that for ANYONE else in quite some time.  She isn’t about to alienate her childcare. We get a grid post of the Webster family dressed up and ready for King John’s softball game.  Alyssa uses AI to write the caption about how much they love cheering Lurch on.  Everyone is still being forced into the jerseys from Rhett’s first birthday, and the big, brown, clodhopping boots are still around.  Even Rhett has to head to the ball park in cowboy boots.  In the pictures Allie is next to Alyssa and Alyssa doesn’t know what to do with her arm because she certainly is not going to wrap it around her daughter.  That level of affection is reserved for those under 5.  Sadly, the last day of co-op arrives and that’s one less place the girls will get to go over the summer.  Alyssa is still forcing Rhett to wear the sad hat in public, and they all celebrate another year of being taught by other mommy cult members with a trip to cult approved Chick-fil-a. Big news!  Rhett is no longer wearing a pink unicorn life vest.  Alyssa broke down and got her boy his own boy’s only floatie.  Now, she is able to film herself laying out, face down, away from her kids, soaking up the sun with no worries.  Poolside she also shows off her new Apple watch and apparently a matching water jug?  No week is complete without a shot of iced coffee and this week’s trip to the coffee shop scored Alyssa a free pin.  Gosh, to be like her… As the weekend arrives, Alyssa has a date night with the mouth breather and decides to break out her double polyester, straight from the Working Women’s section of JC Penney, pant suit for the special occasion. Then, the family attends a wedding where the girls are all forced to wear the exact same dress, courtesy of the Mormon mom’s dress shop.  No individualism is allowed, right down to their matching shoes and bows.  Alyssa snaps a few selfies at the reception with Rhett and with the 3 youngest girls.  Guess who we don’t see a happy, candid shot of?
 
 

 
5.Zach Bates thinks Sundays in the South means Mexican for lunch and he shows off his plate of rice and beans.  Apparently, his switch to influencer is now at the phase where he films even a plate of mid-level food… “camera eats first”. He drops a reel from the workday at the big house where he cooks breakfast for 22 people. He finally opened the gift he gave his dad back in January.  Gil obviously wasn’t stoked about the gift as it was still in the box, 4 months post party.  Whitney heads to the mall with Khloe and Kacie for a big event.  Ellie has turned 18 and is now allowed to get her ears pierced, and Khloe agrees to do it with her.  Kelly Joe and Warden meet them there and Whitney giggles while exploiting her child’s pain for the world to see.  Warden offers comfort after the piercing bc Whitney is too busy filming.  We see Zach and Whitney heading to a friend’s house for dinner and Zach has made the main course to feed 20 head.  How long until he announces his new all beef catering company?  Whitney has graduated from promoting teeth whitening strips and mix tiles to big dog sponsors like the Wander Company that has comped them a free vacation stay in Lake Havasu.  As soon as both she and Zach learn to pronounce the name of the place, they book their flights, leave their kids behind and head out.  They have never been to Arizona and ask for recommendations of things to do and see.  Havasu is known as quite a party place, so it will be interesting to see what they decide to feature.  So far we have only seen the airport, the road and the front of the rental house.  Before leaving, Zach has to squeeze in a haircut.  He has basically shaved his entire head at this point and it sorta looks like a volleyball on shoulders.  Whitney drops a packing reel where she links everything including the packing cubes she is using.  What we all really want to see is what is happening back at their house where the 5 kids have probably been left with Ellie and Warden.  That’s where the real party is happening.


 
 
6.Trace and Lydia’s Florida beach vacation continues this week.  The house they are staying in is pretty fantastic, it’s just too bad that these 2 and their dry friends aren’t able to take full advantage of what it has to offer.  Trace attempts to grill with his friend Andrew, who he says they call Hubert.  This couple are definitely Duggar adjacent and somehow involved in Medic Corps.  Lydia says she is celebrating Hot Girl Summer by eating doughnuts and being 9 months pregnant.  She’s dressed in a church dress with a high collar while saying this and everyone thinks she doesn’t know what that really means.  Lydia’s sister is basically assigned Ryker for the week while Trace and Lydia have several nights out.  They eat out, play miniature golf and have photo shoot after photo shoot on the beach.  Lydia links everything, all week long and all of her clothes are from… you guessed it… H&M.  Their weekly vlog opens with Trace and this Hubert dude attempting to play golf.  Trace tells us 40 times that he is “gettin’ into golf”.  While he whacks the ball around the edges of the course, Lydia and the friend are out having a basic girl date.  They shop at Marshall’s, Old Navy, have coffee, brunch at a chain restaurant and get their nails done.  They show off their purchases while giggling in the car.  Trace tells us that “DaMorow” they are taking Ryker to the beach.  Wait.  They are AT the beach?  Apparently the house is so fun, they haven’t even gone to the beach.  When they finally get there, Ryker hates the sand and Trace commits that “DaDay” is the day he is going to learn to love it.  Spoiler alert.  He does not.  According to Trace, “DaNight” is taco night and he is very excited about that.  First though, he needs Lydia to film him shirtless in the pool for a bit.  Despite the 2 dullards he lives with, Ryker is actually talking up a storm and is speaking German words.  Trace is shocked that his son has the same interests as him and is copying things he does.  How… unique.  Anyway, this whole trip is boring and nothing these people do is even worth watching.  Lydia just keeps on saying she is at the end of her pregnancy, but then you realize, she has 6 weeks still to go.  She keeps saying she is preparing ahead of time so they can enjoy the last few weeks, only to turn around and say she still has so much to do. She is also very excited about a different, unique dress she has.  It’s blue and brown.  Instead of beige.  I can’t care anymore.  Wake me when the baby is here. Maybe.
 


 
 
7.Michael and Brandon are quiet this week.  She has restocked her storefront with baby hats and blankets.  She shares a grid post of April photos and 2 of them are of Baby Miles, obviously her favorite.  Brandon has finally learned how YouTube works and their last vlog featuring the baby rabbits has their highest view count in forever.  Over 94,000 views simply because he titled it “A Special Surprise on Easter” and featured a thumbnail with the baby bunny blurred out.  I’m sure several thousand people assumed it was a… baby.  I don’t feel quite so sorry for them any more.
 
 

 
8.Erin Paine is never not self-righteous.  She posts a video of a preacher blathering away about folks who come to church but aren’t really IN church.  He says they don’t come to worship- and are there for all of the wrong reasons.  Seems she may be talking to a few siblings who love to film themselves while the service is going on. Anyway, this week is her birthday and Chad takes over her IG (different than when he takes AWAY her IG)to rain praises on her for being truth among lies and light over darkness and for making HIM a better person.  He calls himself her “fella” and the whole internet shutters.  Valentine’s day and Mother’s day came and went with no post from Chad, but this is what we get on her birthday.  Guess who liked the post?  Carlin.  Looking over Erin’s Instagram shows that Carlin seems to have gone through and liked many of her posts.  Is there a thawing happening between the 2 mortal enemies?  Is this more of Kelly Joe’s sick bed wishes coming true?  I guess we can all believe it if Erin shows up at Jane’s on July 4th in a BSB dress.  Erin’s vlog announcing baby #7 has over 200,000 views.  Her house tour is also over 200,000 and I think that makes her the most viewed sibling right now.  Erin has put her entire shop on sale for Mother’s day if you want to gift your mom some note cards she doodled on or a leather strap engraved with the word MOM on it.  The beef fat lotion is also on sale, exactly one week after she raised the prices.  What was that about not keeping it in stock again?  Kelly Joe’s birthday post to Erin is not the usual video montage.  Instead, it’s a series of pictures of Erin and her mom says she is talented and beautiful and uses all of her talents to glorify God.  Kelly says she is sorry she isn’t there to celebrate, but mentions that Tori is there with Erin now and that Erin is having a piano concert at her new church.
 
 

 
9.Lawson and Tiffany are stuck in some sort of rut where they just churn out really bad comedy over and over.  I swear it reminds me of Hee-Haw.  Tiffany is determined to be seen as the dumb, poor wife who spends all of her husband’s money and Lawson is the big, strong, wealthy man who bails her out of all of her exploits.  In between these reels, this week, they promote Lawson’s new song exploiting his elderly, ill granddad.  Lawson writes a long letter to Bill before the video drops…. Is Bill Bates on Instagram?  The music video only has a little over 4,000 views on YouTube, so it seems it may be less than a hit.   After asking for weeks about Duke the dog, this week Tiffy showed him for about 1 second in the middle of a reel where she gets mad over Lawson’s old girlfriends…as if there are any.  Tiffy tells us they are leaving on a cruise with her parents, Lawson’s parents and a few of his siblings.  She tries to film a pack with me vlog like the other influencers, but her luggage seems well used and her items are all half empty and less than new.  She says they are traveling somewhere cold and will be exploring the state the cruise leaves from for a few days first.  Comments guess Washington State for an Alaskan cruise, but Tiffy doesn’t say.  That’s why delayed posting is a thing, ya nitwit.  We also learn that Lawson finally got his way, and they have cut Will’s long, fly away hair.  Tiffy says her heart is broken, but what choice did she really have?  She finally scores a paid partnership with an organic baby sleep aid and shows their nighttime routine with Baby Will which includes a camera directly in his face. The rest of the week we see them exploring Washington with Kelly Joe and Callie.  We see reels about baby Will laughing at his mom, and then turning serious and not laughing when Lawson speaks… I’m not sure that’s exactly a flex.  There’s also one where Tiffany says every time she leaves the house she costs Lawson money, so he pushes her back in the house.  Like… what is the point of this?  What do they want people to think?
 


 
 
10.Kelly Joe finally posts about Lawson singin at the Tennessee baseball game and how proud she was of him.  She shows Travis trailing behind Lawson filming him with the big movie style camera.  She reposts all of Tiffany’s posts about the trip they are on.  Funny that she is always there for the good times, but as Tiffy has told us in the past… she wasn’t and isn’t there when times get tough.  On Ellie’s 18th birthday, Kelly says she is tough, independent and an adventurer who isn’t afraid to speak up.  That gives us hope that Ellie may cut a different path…straight to a public insta account and links galore.  She posts pictures and videos from Trace, Warden and Kelton’s flag football games.  The team is now sponsored by Kelton’s company and he has dropped serious coin on their uniforms, warm ups, practice gear and bags.  The picture is quite revealing with the guys in nothing but tights and her Instagram is full of comments from folks who question if the modesty standards are for women only.  Nathan wishes happy birthday to one of the Medic Corps doctors and Kelly shares it showing off pictures of this doctor with Nathan and John David Duggar.


 
Bits and Bytes… Carlin is almost exclusively wearing blue on her Hawaii trip.  Is that a result of having her colors done… or is she telling us something?…BSB wants you to pay $50 for a sleeveless knit top…Speaking of the BSB… where are the mommy and me dresses they have so heavily promoted?...The boutique has yet another sale going this week where If you buy one overpriced item, you can get the second overpriced item for 50% off.  How long can this boutique hang on without the influence of the actual Bates sisters being there daily, hands on??

1kevtjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1kevtjj/makt_it_great/,Makt it great,"I looked out the frosted windowpane, both hands wrapped around my steaming hot coffee mug to hopefully absorb of the warmth. The garbage man was just pulling when I turned away make knowing I needed to get a move on. I started my day with some yoga, got ready for work, and entered the office.

 

When I went in, I was in shock half the women in my department were gone. There were rumblings of budget cuts and layoffs, but nothing concrete. The more people questioned the more those two words got repeated ad nauseum. We all worked nervously figuring the company was following many others and closing its doors. The owner Stanley said some weird remark along the lines of, “We will miss our girls, but this is all for the greater good of the world.”

 

As more weeks passed more people were missing, but I noted almost all were female. I had become so nervous I wasn’t sleeping and so my morning coffee routine had extended to three cups before work. It was trash day again, so I watched as the garbage man emptied my bins, his breath visible in the cool air. That’s when something that has never happened before occurred. He didn’t just leave he began approaching my door. I was wondering if I missed a payment or a holiday bonus, scrambling with what he may need.

 

“Good morning Alicia. Hope you are enjoying this brisk morning. Due to the powers at be sanitation experts as myself have new guidelines to follow.” Bert said very matter of fatly with a smile on his face.

 

My mind was spinning. What was he talking about? Was he unwell? How can I escape talking to him without being rude?

 

“Alicia, I’ve noted and reported to the national registrar of female reproduction in DC, and well they weren’t too happy. You see loose women who use plan b, birth control, and condoms are not what we envision as ‘great again.’ And let’s just say we have been logging your trash. Now it’s my job to take you out with the rest of your trash. One of those new responsibilities we’ve been entrusted with.”

 

I stammered and scrambled but I was no competition for 6’5 Bert and his two minions that were hiding on the side of my house. As they threw me in with the garbage truvk I gagged at the scent of decay and rot.

 

Bert noticed and called out, “Oh no worries love! I really like you and am sad I have to do it so I’ll be using the compressor much sooner than were instructed to. Gotta teach you harlets a lesson. Gotta make America great again.”

 

He smiled down on me truly proud of what was about to happen and simply said. “Hey, maybe you’ll even be able to be with your other co-workers I had to take out with the trash.” As I screamed, I heard the compressor kick on.",1,1746396491.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

I assumed it was for contamination, I'm no doctor but breathing gross microscopic spit balls riddled with germs probably isn't in a patients best interest????? What do I know though. My mum said they were useless. So I dont know maybe surgeons and nurses are trying to protect eachother from their coffee breaths. Maybe they're vampires with a lust for blood hiding their fangs from the anesthetist. Or maybe someone wants to make their day just that bit harder. 🤷‍♀️

Evan and his brother swim in the ocean shirtless and Ethan definitely thinks he is Dylan Efron. Carlin links an Amazon dress that is cheaper than anything she sells at her own boutique, and creates a reel of Zade in the water with her… shirtless.  Posts and reels about the trip begin to perform poorly with less and less comments and shares on each one.  Their usual Saturday vlog is late, but Evan says it’s on the way and it’s one of his favorite ones to date.  Carlin shows up in an ad for Josie’s shop, taking her hair out of the pool noodle curlers.  This means Carlin has a newer ad on the shop’s page than Josie has herself.


 
2.Katie and Travis Clark are in a content rut. After the big numbers they pulled from Harvey’s birth, and the new house….things have slowed down and they don’t seem to have much going on.  Katie does build a unit for toys and poses Hailey front and center while she puts it all together.  She links everything and shows she got her inspiration from a home design page called “The Neutral Home”…. You don’t say.  The unit all together is over $600.  Katie links every toy she places on the shelf in case you didn’t know to use Amazon or Target for toys.  Baby Harvey is very close to crawling and Hailey finally received some mess free markers.  Katie shows off more bland/boring/beige decorations in the house and it’s pretty clear that Hailey is drawing on walls because she needs some dang color in her life.  Instead, she gets to watch her mom unbox and set up a fake olive tree in a beige pot. In the weekly vlog they are back to pushing powdered supplements and Katie says Gil comes by to pick up the free powder all of the time.  Most of the vlog is a rerun of Katie’s trip to NJ for her sister-in-law’s baby shower.  She borrows a brand new dress from Josie and tells the camera that she will try to film some while she is away but she just doesn’t like to do it as much as Travis does.  Just a little reminder that Katie might not be on social media at all if it wasn’t for Travis, who is definitely hungry for the limelight.  Travis now has a blackstone flat top in the backyard so we can also watch while the Clarks eat nothing but red meat.  While Kaite is away, Travis says he and Harvey were in a minor car accident that was not his fault.  They exploit their infant by telling us all of his medical issues and showing him at the actual doctor.  Harvey often has purple hands and feet, so much that folks have messaged them about it.  Couple that with Travis’ dad’s heart condition, and the baby needs to see a cardiologist.  He tests negative for having a bicuspid valve and the doctor isn’t concerned about the purple color of his extremities and says he will grow out of it.  They end the vlog by showing off Hailey’s new Grandma Core big girl bedroom.  Katie has attempted a vintage feel, but it reads more haunted house with the child’s ultrasound pictures hung on the wall in heavy, old fashioned gold frames.  There are shelfs so high she can never reach them and a vase with fake flowers on the night stand… exactly what every 2 year old needs and wants.  The vlog is 17 minutes long but has 6 ad breaks. Katie reposts everything about the cardiologist visit on IG, saying it was “today” when in reality it was more than a week ago.  Double the exploitation is double the cash according to these folks.  The new bedroom for Hailey is also turned into a reel with a healthy debate in the comments on whether or not the bedroom is fitting for a toddler.  Most people hate the creepy ultrasound pictures.  Warden deserves a shout out bc he is featured more than Travis during this room makeover.  It looks like he and Katie did everything while Travis just filmed.  Typical.  The Clarks wrap up the week in Pinehurst, NC visiting their friends the Potter family again.  We see them at a plant nursery, a golf course and out to dinner.  Katie posts a fake question about her plain old denim shorts so she can get her link quota in.  She also shares all of the links to everything in Hailey’s bedroom.



 
3.After dropping her pregnancy announcement, Josie Balka almost took the week off.  She pins the reel announcing the pregnancy on IG and TikTok and sits back to see how well it performs.  It gets about half of the engagement that Carlin’s announcement received, so Josie must be steaming.  She shows up to put makeup on in the car… and it’s a full face of makeup complete with contouring and concealing.  This makeup is over $100 for just the foundation and concealer but she says you really need it… even though for the last few months she said you only needed a tinted moisturizer.  We also get to watch her film herself have her hair washed and trimmed.  Josie could be suffering from morning sickness, or just busy building her McMansion. If she really wants to pull in the numbers, she will share the building of the home bc according to Katie, that brings in the revenue.


 
 
4.Alyssa Webster took the unprecedented move this week to wish her baby sister, and best babysitter, Ellie Bates, a public Happy Birthday.  She even says “I Love You” and features several pictures of Ellie with the fam.  Alyssa hasn’t done that for ANYONE else in quite some time.  She isn’t about to alienate her childcare. We get a grid post of the Webster family dressed up and ready for King John’s softball game.  Alyssa uses AI to write the caption about how much they love cheering Lurch on.  Everyone is still being forced into the jerseys from Rhett’s first birthday, and the big, brown, clodhopping boots are still around.  Even Rhett has to head to the ball park in cowboy boots.  In the pictures Allie is next to Alyssa and Alyssa doesn’t know what to do with her arm because she certainly is not going to wrap it around her daughter.  That level of affection is reserved for those under 5.  Sadly, the last day of co-op arrives and that’s one less place the girls will get to go over the summer.  Alyssa is still forcing Rhett to wear the sad hat in public, and they all celebrate another year of being taught by other mommy cult members with a trip to cult approved Chick-fil-a. Big news!  Rhett is no longer wearing a pink unicorn life vest.  Alyssa broke down and got her boy his own boy’s only floatie.  Now, she is able to film herself laying out, face down, away from her kids, soaking up the sun with no worries.  Poolside she also shows off her new Apple watch and apparently a matching water jug?  No week is complete without a shot of iced coffee and this week’s trip to the coffee shop scored Alyssa a free pin.  Gosh, to be like her… As the weekend arrives, Alyssa has a date night with the mouth breather and decides to break out her double polyester, straight from the Working Women’s section of JC Penney, pant suit for the special occasion. Then, the family attends a wedding where the girls are all forced to wear the exact same dress, courtesy of the Mormon mom’s dress shop.  No individualism is allowed, right down to their matching shoes and bows.  Alyssa snaps a few selfies at the reception with Rhett and with the 3 youngest girls.  Guess who we don’t see a happy, candid shot of?
 
 

 
5.Zach Bates thinks Sundays in the South means Mexican for lunch and he shows off his plate of rice and beans.  Apparently, his switch to influencer is now at the phase where he films even a plate of mid-level food… “camera eats first”. He drops a reel from the workday at the big house where he cooks breakfast for 22 people. He finally opened the gift he gave his dad back in January.  Gil obviously wasn’t stoked about the gift as it was still in the box, 4 months post party.  Whitney heads to the mall with Khloe and Kacie for a big event.  Ellie has turned 18 and is now allowed to get her ears pierced, and Khloe agrees to do it with her.  Kelly Joe and Warden meet them there and Whitney giggles while exploiting her child’s pain for the world to see.  Warden offers comfort after the piercing bc Whitney is too busy filming.  We see Zach and Whitney heading to a friend’s house for dinner and Zach has made the main course to feed 20 head.  How long until he announces his new all beef catering company?  Whitney has graduated from promoting teeth whitening strips and mix tiles to big dog sponsors like the Wander Company that has comped them a free vacation stay in Lake Havasu.  As soon as both she and Zach learn to pronounce the name of the place, they book their flights, leave their kids behind and head out.  They have never been to Arizona and ask for recommendations of things to do and see.  Havasu is known as quite a party place, so it will be interesting to see what they decide to feature.  So far we have only seen the airport, the road and the front of the rental house.  Before leaving, Zach has to squeeze in a haircut.  He has basically shaved his entire head at this point and it sorta looks like a volleyball on shoulders.  Whitney drops a packing reel where she links everything including the packing cubes she is using.  What we all really want to see is what is happening back at their house where the 5 kids have probably been left with Ellie and Warden.  That’s where the real party is happening.


 
 
6.Trace and Lydia’s Florida beach vacation continues this week.  The house they are staying in is pretty fantastic, it’s just too bad that these 2 and their dry friends aren’t able to take full advantage of what it has to offer.  Trace attempts to grill with his friend Andrew, who he says they call Hubert.  This couple are definitely Duggar adjacent and somehow involved in Medic Corps.  Lydia says she is celebrating Hot Girl Summer by eating doughnuts and being 9 months pregnant.  She’s dressed in a church dress with a high collar while saying this and everyone thinks she doesn’t know what that really means.  Lydia’s sister is basically assigned Ryker for the week while Trace and Lydia have several nights out.  They eat out, play miniature golf and have photo shoot after photo shoot on the beach.  Lydia links everything, all week long and all of her clothes are from… you guessed it… H&M.  Their weekly vlog opens with Trace and this Hubert dude attempting to play golf.  Trace tells us 40 times that he is “gettin’ into golf”.  While he whacks the ball around the edges of the course, Lydia and the friend are out having a basic girl date.  They shop at Marshall’s, Old Navy, have coffee, brunch at a chain restaurant and get their nails done.  They show off their purchases while giggling in the car.  Trace tells us that “DaMorow” they are taking Ryker to the beach.  Wait.  They are AT the beach?  Apparently the house is so fun, they haven’t even gone to the beach.  When they finally get there, Ryker hates the sand and Trace commits that “DaDay” is the day he is going to learn to love it.  Spoiler alert.  He does not.  According to Trace, “DaNight” is taco night and he is very excited about that.  First though, he needs Lydia to film him shirtless in the pool for a bit.  Despite the 2 dullards he lives with, Ryker is actually talking up a storm and is speaking German words.  Trace is shocked that his son has the same interests as him and is copying things he does.  How… unique.  Anyway, this whole trip is boring and nothing these people do is even worth watching.  Lydia just keeps on saying she is at the end of her pregnancy, but then you realize, she has 6 weeks still to go.  She keeps saying she is preparing ahead of time so they can enjoy the last few weeks, only to turn around and say she still has so much to do. She is also very excited about a different, unique dress she has.  It’s blue and brown.  Instead of beige.  I can’t care anymore.  Wake me when the baby is here. Maybe.
 


 
 
7.Michael and Brandon are quiet this week.  She has restocked her storefront with baby hats and blankets.  She shares a grid post of April photos and 2 of them are of Baby Miles, obviously her favorite.  Brandon has finally learned how YouTube works and their last vlog featuring the baby rabbits has their highest view count in forever.  Over 94,000 views simply because he titled it “A Special Surprise on Easter” and featured a thumbnail with the baby bunny blurred out.  I’m sure several thousand people assumed it was a… baby.  I don’t feel quite so sorry for them any more.
 
 

 
8.Erin Paine is never not self-righteous.  She posts a video of a preacher blathering away about folks who come to church but aren’t really IN church.  He says they don’t come to worship- and are there for all of the wrong reasons.  Seems she may be talking to a few siblings who love to film themselves while the service is going on. Anyway, this week is her birthday and Chad takes over her IG (different than when he takes AWAY her IG)to rain praises on her for being truth among lies and light over darkness and for making HIM a better person.  He calls himself her “fella” and the whole internet shutters.  Valentine’s day and Mother’s day came and went with no post from Chad, but this is what we get on her birthday.  Guess who liked the post?  Carlin.  Looking over Erin’s Instagram shows that Carlin seems to have gone through and liked many of her posts.  Is there a thawing happening between the 2 mortal enemies?  Is this more of Kelly Joe’s sick bed wishes coming true?  I guess we can all believe it if Erin shows up at Jane’s on July 4th in a BSB dress.  Erin’s vlog announcing baby #7 has over 200,000 views.  Her house tour is also over 200,000 and I think that makes her the most viewed sibling right now.  Erin has put her entire shop on sale for Mother’s day if you want to gift your mom some note cards she doodled on or a leather strap engraved with the word MOM on it.  The beef fat lotion is also on sale, exactly one week after she raised the prices.  What was that about not keeping it in stock again?  Kelly Joe’s birthday post to Erin is not the usual video montage.  Instead, it’s a series of pictures of Erin and her mom says she is talented and beautiful and uses all of her talents to glorify God.  Kelly says she is sorry she isn’t there to celebrate, but mentions that Tori is there with Erin now and that Erin is having a piano concert at her new church.
 
 

 
9.Lawson and Tiffany are stuck in some sort of rut where they just churn out really bad comedy over and over.  I swear it reminds me of Hee-Haw.  Tiffany is determined to be seen as the dumb, poor wife who spends all of her husband’s money and Lawson is the big, strong, wealthy man who bails her out of all of her exploits.  In between these reels, this week, they promote Lawson’s new song exploiting his elderly, ill granddad.  Lawson writes a long letter to Bill before the video drops…. Is Bill Bates on Instagram?  The music video only has a little over 4,000 views on YouTube, so it seems it may be less than a hit.   After asking for weeks about Duke the dog, this week Tiffy showed him for about 1 second in the middle of a reel where she gets mad over Lawson’s old girlfriends…as if there are any.  Tiffy tells us they are leaving on a cruise with her parents, Lawson’s parents and a few of his siblings.  She tries to film a pack with me vlog like the other influencers, but her luggage seems well used and her items are all half empty and less than new.  She says they are traveling somewhere cold and will be exploring the state the cruise leaves from for a few days first.  Comments guess Washington State for an Alaskan cruise, but Tiffy doesn’t say.  That’s why delayed posting is a thing, ya nitwit.  We also learn that Lawson finally got his way, and they have cut Will’s long, fly away hair.  Tiffy says her heart is broken, but what choice did she really have?  She finally scores a paid partnership with an organic baby sleep aid and shows their nighttime routine with Baby Will which includes a camera directly in his face. The rest of the week we see them exploring Washington with Kelly Joe and Callie.  We see reels about baby Will laughing at his mom, and then turning serious and not laughing when Lawson speaks… I’m not sure that’s exactly a flex.  There’s also one where Tiffany says every time she leaves the house she costs Lawson money, so he pushes her back in the house.  Like… what is the point of this?  What do they want people to think?
 


 
 
10.Kelly Joe finally posts about Lawson singin at the Tennessee baseball game and how proud she was of him.  She shows Travis trailing behind Lawson filming him with the big movie style camera.  She reposts all of Tiffany’s posts about the trip they are on.  Funny that she is always there for the good times, but as Tiffy has told us in the past… she wasn’t and isn’t there when times get tough.  On Ellie’s 18th birthday, Kelly says she is tough, independent and an adventurer who isn’t afraid to speak up.  That gives us hope that Ellie may cut a different path…straight to a public insta account and links galore.  She posts pictures and videos from Trace, Warden and Kelton’s flag football games.  The team is now sponsored by Kelton’s company and he has dropped serious coin on their uniforms, warm ups, practice gear and bags.  The picture is quite revealing with the guys in nothing but tights and her Instagram is full of comments from folks who question if the modesty standards are for women only.  Nathan wishes happy birthday to one of the Medic Corps doctors and Kelly shares it showing off pictures of this doctor with Nathan and John David Duggar.


 
Bits and Bytes… Carlin is almost exclusively wearing blue on her Hawaii trip.  Is that a result of having her colors done… or is she telling us something?…BSB wants you to pay $50 for a sleeveless knit top…Speaking of the BSB… where are the mommy and me dresses they have so heavily promoted?...The boutique has yet another sale going this week where If you buy one overpriced item, you can get the second overpriced item for 50% off.  How long can this boutique hang on without the influence of the actual Bates sisters being there daily, hands on??

Hey there, potential future friend!

So here’s the deal — I’m a real human person (flesh, bones, caffeine addiction — the whole package), but this post? It’s written by my AI sidekick because I couldn’t figure out how to say “I want friends” without sounding like a lost Victorian ghost — you know, all “Dear Reader, I do hope we may correspond via telegram and tea.”

Anyway — I’m looking for genuine, platonic, belly-laugh-until-you-snort kind of friendship. The “send each other cursed memes at 3am” kind. The “rant about the state of the world and then pivot to what snacks we’re currently obsessed with” kind.

I’m: — Late 40s, young at heart, old in knees
— Living in the U.S. (in a place with too many Dollar Generals)
— ADHD-having, cat-loving, and extremely over the group chat that never replies
— Not selling feet pics (I do not have an OnlyFans — unless y’all want awkward selfies and photos of my cat judging humanity, which... still no)

Also — and I cannot stress this enough — no MAGA nonsense.
I do not support:

— Have interests, or at least funny thoughts about them

So my first week on 2.5, I experienced all the things I think I’ve read here as far as food noise going down, but I still got hungry. But to be honest because of some prior G.I. issues I’m not one that really gets hungry a ton or looks to over eat heavily. (But despite this, my weight is a shit show with a SW 272)

Generally: Was tired the day after my shot, but, wasn’t sure if it was a sleeping issue. Had some headache, but seriously nothing major. Given my history of fairly regular G.I. issues, I watched my water intake,  used electrolytes, prophylactically added MiraLAX to my morning coffee, and I was already on a relatively high dose of magnesium every evening. If I thought I was getting stopped up even a little bit, I also added in stool softener.

Week two was pretty much a mirror image of week one, until the past about 24 hours. All of a sudden, my appetite has dropped all the way off, but I still made sure I ate enough. Like yesterday I really did not want to eat at all, but I did go out for brunch with my wife and had a couple of poached eggs over a piece of avocado toast that had spinach, some olives/feta up on. I ate the other half of that avocado toast for dinner. I also took a fair life protein shake. Again, I’ve been sucking back electrolytes and staying incredibly well hydrated.

But as of right now, I’m fairly nauseous after having some tomato soup and a sandwich. To be fair, I was very active on my horse farm all day, and wasn’t able to eat… but this is actually normal for me. I frequently even pre-Zep had zero interest in breakfast, especially if working on the farm….but, even without food and working on fencing, I did try to stay on top of hydration with electrolyte infused water (28oz)  and a good 28 ounces of liquid IV given it was physically difficult work. (Side note the work was harder than usual and I did get dizzy) 

Has anybody else had more of the nausea towards the end of their week versus freshly after the shot? 

If I understand the PK of the drug, I won’t be steady state by this upcoming week, but I should have been at 1/2 life of the last shot on Friday. ",1,1746396124.0,Zepbound,1,1.0,False

I was recently reflecting on how I got some penpal friends from here during the onset of the pandemic and how much I enjoyed the contact and the time dedicated to writing out letters for someone. It kind of fizzled out over the years as times changed and I got busy but I really enjoyed it and would love to chit chat and make new friends again.

I’m a recently graduated nurse of about a year ago and have been employed at a hospital for about six months. I like to consider myself a fairly laid back and cozy person and love my creature comforts like morning coffee, tasty breakfast, casual video gaming, knick knacks for my shelves, board games (mostly single player), and reading which is a large hobby of mine. Movies are also a big interest of mine; I mostly lean on horror with reading and watching but that’s not a firm restriction, I’ll look into anything that gets my interest.

I’m also a lifelong Star Wars fan (may the 4th be with you 😉) and I love the whole saga including the spinoffs and extended media though I’m not stuck up about people who aren’t into it/haven’t seen it.

I’m definitely a people person and would love to write some letters and make connections whether it’s here in the USA or international. Or if you want to just exchange a postcard for a quick hello I think that’s cool too!

* Anything you want to discuss outside of the scheduled posts can be done so in the [Marginalia](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/s/aKhjF6N7xZ)

 * Since we *never* get bored of hearing them, the rules of the cafe :D 
	1. The only people you can meet in the past are those who have visited the cafe. 
	2. There is nothing you can do while in the past that will change the present. 
	3. In order to return to the past, you have to sit in that seat and that seat alone.
	4. If the seat is occupied, you must wait until it is vacated. While back in the past, you must stay in the seat and never move from it. 
	5. Your journey begins when the coffee is poured and must end before the coffee gets cold.

We’re also introduced to a whole heap of new characters. We have:

* The new members of the Tokita family, **Sachi Tokita** - Kazu’s 7 year old daughter who now does the ceremonial coffee pouring at Donna Donna, **Kozu Shintani (Tokita)** - Sachi’s father and Kazu’s husband, and **Yukari Tokita** - Nagare’s mother and the owner of Donna Donna
* The Donna Donna regulars, **Nanako Matsubara** - a student at Hakodate University and **Dr Saki Muraoka** - a psychiatric at one of Hakodate’s hospitals. 
* The part time cafe employee, **Reiji Ono** - also a student at Hakodate University
* *The Daughter*, **Yayoi Seto** - travelling to visit her mother - **Miyuki Seto** and father - **Keiichi Seto**
* *The Comedians*,  **PORON DORON** - aka **Kohta Hayashida** and **Glen Todoroki**
* Todoroki’s wife - **Setsuko Yoshioka**

#I - The Daughter

The first story starts with a throwback to *Tales from the Cafe* where we saw Kei travelling to the future to visit her daughter. She was supposed to travel 10 years into the future but somehow 10 years and 15 hours was mixed up with 15 years and 10 hours. We now know why Nagare wasn’t there when Kei appeared in *that* seat. We’re introduced to the new City, Hakodate, where Nagare travelled to run his mother’s cafe, Donna Donna, in her absence. He’s taken Kazu and her daughter Sachi with him as only Tokita women aged 7+ can pour the ceremonial coffee, but if a woman becomes pregnant with a girl she relinquishes the ability to her daughter.

Nanako and Saki are discussing the book *What If The World Were Ending Tomorrow? One Hundred Questions*. This gains the attention of Sachi - who recently arrived at the cafe and was showing off her new books, *‘Problems of Classical Art Learned from Picasso.’ ‘The Spiritual World of African Textiles.’*. Not only is she an avid reader, but a philosophical genius at the tender age of 7! Reiji also enters the cafe… Throughout all this a woman named Yayoi has been chilling and enjoying the illustrious coffee. She settles up and leaves, dropping a photo that features a young Yukari posing alongside a couple with their newborn. The photo is later discovered when Saki is leaving the cafe and it appears to feature a young couple posing with Yukari 20 years ago, but the picture is imprinted with the current date - ‘2030-08-27 20:31. 

Kazu and Reiji are closing up for the night when Yayoi returns and is questioned about the photograph. She says the couple are her parents, who died while she was young and left her to live a miserable life. She wants to go back in time to make them feel a fraction of the pain she’s felt as a result of their death. Although uncertain about her reason to go back, Reiji explains the rules of time travel to Yayoi in great detail and she’s miffed at their ridiculousness, and the lack of sufficient answers to her questions besides “because that’s the rule”, but she still decides to travel back so she can give her parents a piece of her mind. 

Upon travelling back, Yayoi realises she didn’t ask about how to get to the correct date and time and is worried that she won’t catch her parents *Before The Coffee Gets Cold*. Fortunately she has the picture with her and the clock in the background is 8 minutes ahead of when she arrived. Before the Seto’s arrive we see a glimpse of *The Comedians* PORON DORON as they discover themselves with Yukari’s help. When the cafe quietens down Yayoi explaining why she’s travelled back in time Yukari, airs her grevenaces about her parents. Following this Miyuki and Keiichi arrive in the cafe and have a heartfelt moment with Yukari where they introduce their new baby girl to her. Miyuki goes on to thank Yukari for saving her from committing suicide and giving her a new lease for life. It unfolds that a lot of the pain Miyuki went through growing up is mirrored by what Yayoi has experienced in her own life. In seeing her mother now happy and thriving, Yayoi has second thoughts about suicide and is instead inspired to regain control of her life just as her mother did. She’s given a camera and asked to take the photo she spent 20 years staring at, before downing the coffee and returning to the present day.

But a twist! Not long after Yayoi arrives and relinquishes *that* seat to the old gentleman, his spirit ascends from the chair and is replaced with Miyuki from the day Yukari saved her. She’s not sure what she’s doing there because Yukari said to her “here drink this and imagine” (this infuriates Nagare to no end because his mother doesn’t explain the rules). Yayoi and Miyuki have a lovely heart to heart and Yayoi begs her mother to live for her sake, unaware that the rules of not changing the present also apply to people travelling *from* the past and not just *to* the past. 

Reiji can’t quite get past the fact that Kazu happily let Yayoi travel back in time when she appeared to be suicidal but she explains to him that she knew Yayoi didn’t truly harbour any hatred for her parents because she’d kept their photograph in pristine condition for 20 years.


#II - The Comedian

In the second story we see the return of Hayashida, one half of the comedic duo PORON DORON, who has been enjoying the book *What If The World Were Ending Tomorrow? One Hundred Questions* alongside Sachi. Hayashida has been visiting the cafe for three days -  staying from opening until close hoping to catch his long time friend, and second half of PORON DORON, Todoroki. Todoroki has gone M.I.A since the pair won the Comedian’s Grand Prix. Hayashida thinks he will visit the cafe to return back in time to see his deceased wife whose wish it was for them to win the award. This thought was brought on by a postcard Hayashida received from the Yukari congratulating him on the award, where she wrote **”I’m sure Setsuko would be happy for you, too”**. He believes that Todoroki would likely have received the same postcard, remembered the cafe’s special offering, and visit to go back in time to see Setsuko.

Later in the day, when Hayashida is no longer there, Todoroki enters the Cafe while Reiji and Nagare are discussing the reasons for Hayashida’s apprehension in allowing Todoroki to travel back in time. Todoroki explains to them that he wants to inform his wife of the award to see the happiness on her face. Reiji fetches Sachi and Kazu and they go through the ceremony allowing Todoroki to return to the past. Just as Todoroki’s spirit ascends from the seat Hayashida storms into the Cafe, noticing this, and manhandles Reiji asking why he would allow Todoroki to sit in *that* seat. He then explains his true reasons for not wanting Todoroki to go back in time and shows Reiji and Nagare the text message Todoroki has sent him just before going back. Reiji is left crestfallen at this discovery.

We go back in time 5 years to see Yukari and Setsuko conversing in in the Cafe when Todoroki suddenly appears in *that* seat. He makes up a story about Setsuko complaining about how she’s aged and so he is travelling back to prove to her that she hasn’t by comparing against her former self. After Todoroki satisfies Setsuko with the notion that she hasn’t aged Yukari reminds her of what they were discussing previously and she questions his true motives for travelling back in time. She’s aware that it could only be to bring her news because she has passed away. He tells her about the Comedians Grand Prix and she runs around the Cafe, screaming like a headless chicken and tiring herself out in the process. Now that he’s given Setsuko the news she informs him that he must drink the coffee and go back to the present but he reveals his plans to let the coffee get cold. She doesn’t allow him, stating that he must continue to thrive in her memory as he has done for the last 5 years while working towards the Comedian’s Grand Prix award. He realises that his efforts to achieve this award in her memory only make up a small percentage of his life and he still has so much to live for. He drinks the coffee and returns to the present. *Phew!*

Back in the cafe Reiji, Nagare and Hayashida are in low moods at the realisation of Todoroki’s plans and Hayashida is apologising for not being clearer about his reason for trying to stop him. Kazu mentions that based on interactions with the two she realised that Hayashida had been visiting the cafe for this reason and she was also aware that Todoroki was planning not to return. Hayashida’s anger returns and he queries why Kazu let him go knowing what she knew. She states that Setsuko, having also been a Cafe regular, would be familiar with the rules and would not idly stand by as someone she loved let the coffee get cold. Immediately after this Todoroki returns to the chair and everyone is elated to see him. Kazu was right, of course… 

I hope you’re enjoying the book so far! Next week we’ll be discussing the final two chapters:
**III - The Sister** & **IV - The Young Man**.

Until then, May the 4th be with you…

[What should I do? Incomplete Closure: When the Contact Keeps Rekindling : r/GuyCry](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1jlgbyz/what_should_i_do_incomplete_closure_when_the/)

I stayed strong and stopped reaching out to her first. Every now and then she’d send something (like a meme), and I’d just react to it.

But about three weeks ago, I was going through a tough time, so I asked her if she wanted to go bouldering with me, since no one else could go because of exams. I thought it would be okay since we had ended things on good terms. She said she’d really like to. So we planned a session, but just a few hours before, she canceled last minute because she was feeling mentally overwhelmed. I told her that was okay and just went by myself. I also told her she could message me if she ever needed a bouldering buddy.

Now to the actual problem: we’re organizing a Metal Heads meet-up together at uni. At the last meet-up, she messaged me around noon asking where and when it was. But then she didn’t show up because she overslept. She later messaged me saying she was sorry and felt bad about it. I replied that I didn’t think it was cool and that I was disappointed.

Now she wants to make it up to me by going for coffee together. I agreed because it seemed important to her.

But honestly, I’m still kind of upset and really not in the mood for the meeting. And I’m a bit worried I’ll come across as cold or mean.",1,1746395875.0,GuyCry,1,1.0,False

1kevka5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1kevka5/still_in_the_snow/,Still In The Snow,"Amanda woke immediately tense and tried to move. Failing to do so, she realized she was having another sleep paralysis episode—a common occurrence in her daily life at this point, but that never made it easier. Then her demon paid her a visit, a shadow in the shape of a man leaning over her. The mouth—or where it would be on the shadow—moved, gurgling the words, each one followed by a drip of black sludge from the shadow's mouth right onto her face.

""Tick tock, tick tock, tick to—""

The shadow faded as her alarm started beeping loudly, making Amanda sit up in her bed quickly. She turned off her alarm, feeling a cold sweat soaking her clothes.

""Fuck, it's getting worse,"" she mumbled to herself, tears almost filling her eyes as she got up and walked to the bathroom, opening up a pill bottle and taking two. Apparently, they were supposed to help stop sleep paralysis—in exchange for paranoia, anxiety, and occasionally hallucinations—but it helped. She had recently gotten a refill, a change of brand, so the pills looked different.

Just then, her phone rang. It was from her father, so she picked it up quickly.

""Hey, Dad,"" she spoke, sounding a bit tired with a hint of fear—the episode still affecting her—as she held the phone to her ear.

""Hi, Kiddo, you ready for the weekend trip to the family cabin in the mountains?""

Her father sounded excited; he always seemed to look forward to these trips even after all that had happened.

""Yeah, Dad, I'm looking forward to it. I finished packing my stuff last night, so I'll meet you there by noon.""

She walked back into her bedroom, holding her phone to her ear with her shoulder as she picked out her clothes for the day.

""Alright, honey, just be safe. The roads can get bad with the snow,"" her father said, sounding concerned.

""I know, Dad, don't worry. Bye.""

She hung up and got dressed, understanding his concern.

See, her mother had gotten lost years ago during a hike on the mountain. Amanda was young at the time—12 years old, to be exact. Her mother had gone on a hike while Amanda's dad watched her. She never came back. A blizzard started just hours after she left. Amanda's father couldn't do anything—he didn't want to leave her alone in the cabin but also knew it wasn't safe to search for his wife—so he called the police after the blizzard, hoping she would be found. They never did. The snow had covered any tracks and blocked many cave entrances.

Amanda could never forget that night. That's where she got her sleep paralysis demon—watching out the windows of that cabin, distant shadowy figures in the snow, and the ticking of the clock as the seconds passed.

Amanda had an aching feeling the reason her father loved going back there was because a small part of him still thought he would find her mother.

Amanda shut her eyes tight for a moment, bringing herself back to this exact moment, dressed in the outfit she had picked out.

""I really need to set an appointment with my therapist again. This shit is starting to get to me,"" she spoke aloud to herself, an attempt to remember to set it.

Amanda left the house shortly after, loaded up her car, and started her drive up the mountain.  
The drive was mostly normal, except Amanda felt the need to keep checking behind her—in the backseat—the constant feeling of someone watching her, or some presence in the backseat at least.

""It's just the pills' side effects,"" she reminded herself as she turned on the radio. Her therapist had suggested distractions and reminding herself it was just the pills.

Otherwise, the ride was fine. She arrived at the cabin quite quickly, parking her car next to her dad's red sedan.

Amanda exited her car, looking at the dusting of snow on the ground before heading inside, seeing her dad making coffee on the wood burner.

""I don't know how you drink that shit, it's so bitter,"" Amanda said.

Her father smiled as he heard her voice, looking over at Amanda.

""Well, unlike you, I don't get that sugary Starbucks shit every day.""

Amanda chuckled, setting down her bag on the table. She was always able to be more open with her father—curse in front of him, even insult him—and never got in trouble for it.

""Well, it tastes good, and I have the money for it. It's good to see you, Dad. I look forward to the weekend.""

Amanda's dad smiled and walked over to Amanda with his small mug of coffee.

""I'm glad you're looking forward to it. Could you bring in some more wood? It's supposed to get cold tonight and snow some more, so the more logs you can bring in, the better.""

Amanda nodded and spoke.  
""Yeah, sure, Dad. You're better with the wood burner than me anyway.""

She walked outside to the wood stack on the side of the cabin. Amanda began picking up the wood, stacking it against her chest and arm to carry more inside.

Suddenly, Amanda saw something out of the corner of her eye.  
She dropped the wood and turned to look at the shadowy figure she thought she saw, but it was gone.

""Just the pills,"" she repeated to herself, reminding herself it wasn't real, as she picked up the wood she dropped and carried it inside.

Amanda's dad looked at her as the door opened.  
""Are you alright? I thought I heard a bit of a ruckus out there.""

Amanda shut the door and set the logs next to the wood burner.  
""Yeah, I'm fine. Just dropped some of the wood,"" she said, not wanting to explain further and concern him.

""Alright, be more careful next time. Could break a toe if you drop it on your foot.""

She nodded at her father's warning, turning on the radio before laying down on the couch. The radio began playing Christmas music after the familiar local DJ, Jackie Spells, wished everyone a nice holiday season.

""You know, Amanda, your mother was close friends with that DJ,"" her father recalled as he stoked the fire.

""Really? I didn't know she was friends with him.""

Her father shut the wood burner and the latch before continuing.  
""Yeah, they were friends in high school before me and your mother started dating. Jackie was real broken up about it when he heard she went missing—mentioned it on the radio for like a month.""

This was news to Amanda. She hadn't even met Jackie when she was a kid, and her mom didn't seem like the type to be friends with a DJ, even a local one.

""Well, I guess she was more wild when she was younger than I thought.""

Her dad chuckled before he bundled up.  
""Well, I'm going to walk the trails. Would you like to join me?""

He walked to the door but paused, looking at her.

""No, I'll go on one tomorrow, but it's too cold for me today.""

Her dad left without much else to say, leaving her alone in the cabin.  
The only sounds were the wood burner, Christmas music, and her breathing.

Amanda shifted off the couch, walking over to a cooler and removing a beer from it—one her father had brought.

""One beer can't hurt,"" she mumbled to herself, remembering that she wasn't supposed to drink on her medications.

She cracked the can open, taking a sip, allowing the piss-like drink into her mouth. She never enjoyed the taste but didn't have many options at the moment.

""Fuck, I always forget how bad this tastes.""  
She took another sip before looking out the window, her eyes fixing on the horizon as the snow began to fall at a slightly increased pace.

Right before she took another sip, her eyes fixed on one of those fucking figures—features obscured by darkness—but even as she stared directly at it, the figure didn't disappear.

Amanda's heart started beating faster. She dropped the beer, only a few sips in, allowing it to spill onto the wood floor.

""That has to be someone,"" Amanda told herself, even though there were no other cabins nearby, and the hiking trail her father took wasn't anywhere close to where she saw the figure.

Amanda grabbed her coat, bundling up—her shoes were still on—as she ran outside shouting.

""Hey, you're not meant to be here! You're trespassing!""  
She shouted as the figure took off running at a very fast pace—seemed more like a deer or a track runner the way it moved.

Amanda followed. She wanted a good look at this thing.  
With each step, the snow got deeper—more and more debris, sticks, and rocks made it harder to give chase.

Amanda tripped, letting out a scream, but before she hit the snowy ground, everything went black for a moment.

Amanda shot up on the couch with a scream, her heart racing as she let out hurried breaths, looking around.

""It was a fucking nightmare?!"" she shouted—questioning, confused, and scared all at once—standing up off the couch, holding her head as she saw her coat still hung up.

""I can't... ugh,"" she struggled with her words for a moment as she reached into her pocket, dialing her doctor's number.

One ring.  
Two rings.  
Then a voice.

""Good afternoon, Dr. West's office. This is Emily speaking. How may I help you today?""

The receptionist's voice came over the phone, a slight relief to Amanda as she took another breath to calm down and speak properly.

""Hello, Emily, it's Amanda. I need to speak to Dr. West immediately. I don't give a fuck if he's a bit busy—I need to speak to him. So transfer me, or whatever you have to do. I have to speak to him.""

The receptionist heard the seriousness in Amanda's voice.

""Ma'am, please calm down. You're lucky he isn't busy—I'll transfer you over.""

A few moments of silence passed before a masculine voice came over the phone.

""Hello, this is Dr. West speaking.""

Amanda responded quickly.

""What the fuck were these meds you gave me, Doc? I'm seeing shit—stuff that ain't there—my dreams are feeling real, and let me tell you, a nightmare ain't fucking pleasant when it feels like you're really going through it.""

Amanda didn't really think out the words she was saying.

""Amanda, you ran out of refills two months ago. Where did you get those?""

Amanda quickly hung up her phone as memories flooded back into her head.  
How could she forget? Even in a panic she should have remembered—she had been buying the pills illegally from a pharmacist who had a thing for her.

As she started pacing, trying to calm herself down, she stepped in a sticky puddle by the window. Looking down, she saw the slightly yellow liquid.

""Beer?""

Her heart almost stopped beating in her chest as she stood frozen, staring out the window. More of those things stood there, it was getting darker, and the snow was picking up even more.

""It's a bad batch. It has to be a bad batch. I must be tripping. That asshole must have realized I wasn't into him and gave me a higher dose—something like that.""

She tried to calm herself down, reminding herself of her college bad weed trips—but those things she was staring at—those things were real. There was no changing that in her mind. And they were slowly getting closer to the cabin.

She stepped out of the beer puddle and threw on her jacket again.  
Only this time, she took off running on the trail her dad had taken earlier.

""Dad! Dad, where the fuck are you!""  
She shouted, tears pouring down her face as she ran. She could feel those things following her. She only stopped when she saw more of them ahead, blocking the path.

""Fuck, fuck, I can't—oh God.""

Amanda panicked, turning and running into the woods, shedding her jacket when it got caught on a branch. The cold immediately hit her—biting at her skin without protection—as she stumbled forward, noticing she didn't see the things chasing her anymore.

Shivering violently, she staggered through the trees until her blurry, frozen gaze caught sight of a cave entrance.

Without thinking, Amanda pushed through the brush and stumbled inside.  
Relief quickly turned to horror.

""M-Mom?""

The word slipped out, broken and small, as she spotted a frozen corpse. The skin was blue, one ear had fallen off at some point, but that hair—those clothes—that was her mother.

Amanda inched closer, reaching out with trembling fingers as if she could still check for a pulse.

A snap of a branch made her whip her head around.  
At the entrance of the cave, one of those things stood there, blocking her escape.

""No!""  
Amanda screamed, voice cracking in terror as she ran at the thing, trying to push past it—but before she could, snow collapsed from above the cave mouth, sealing her inside.

She clawed at the packed snow until her fingers were red and numb, each movement getting slower, weaker, until finally she stopped.

Defeated and shivering, Amanda walked back to her mother's frozen body.  
She curled up beside it, her tears freezing on her cheeks as her eyes drifted shut.

""I'm so sorry, Mom... I'm so sorry...""  
The words faded into the cold, swallowed by the dark.

I’m an outgoing introvert with an alt/punk mindset, even if I don’t always look the part—I’ve got a corporate job but a rebellious spirit. 😏 I’m 5’8”, INTP, and an atheist in Utah (help). I don’t have kids myself, but I’m all about building a meaningful connection with the right person regardless.

# A Bit About Me

I love a mix of chill and adventure—think game nights, brewery trivia, live music, concerts, hockey games, and festivals. I’m also into skiing/snowboarding in the winter, though I’m not the biggest fan of summer outdoor activities unless there’s a body of water involved. I’ve got a soft spot for board games (from chess to more modern hits), joint cooking nights, and being ridiculously snuggly for a grown-ass man.

I recently moved to SLC, so I’m still exploring the area and making friends. Saturday is typically my event day, and Sundays are usually spent with a French-press Irish coffee and some indoor chill time, or hitting up brunch if I’m feeling spicy. 🥂

# What I’m Looking For

I’m seeking a true partner in life who’s open to new experiences—I rarely turn down something I’ve never done before, and I’d love to find someone with a similar mindset. Bonus points if you can laugh at yourself, and have a go-with-the-flow vibe. I’m all about finding someone to share both the cozy nights and the big adventures.

# Let’s Chat!

If you’re into game nights, good food, or trying new things, let’s connect. Tell me your favorite board game or food truck spot—I’m always down for a recommendation. 😊

Edit: Added disclosure, the above was written with AI because if i had it my way, I'd just make a bunch of lists (the INTP in me), so I felt like adding some more misc info (in lists):

Music: Gogol Bordello (fav), Lana Del Ray, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, Florence + The Machine, Rezz, Ashnikko, Bridge City Sinners, Dr. Fresch, Streetlight Manifesto... I've seen all of these live at least once.

Hobbies: Skiing/Snowboarding addict. I will never turn down an invite on the slopes. Gaming - I love board game nights and spend a lot of my free time socializing with remote friends online gaming. MMOs (nothing i'm hooked on at the moment), FPS (Tarkov/Apex/Valorant), and chill co-op games (Battleblock Theater anyone?). TV/Movies - i don't watch much TV much at all by myself, i prefer more interactive entertainment. I do however love snuggling with my significant other to watch a show, but it's more about the dedicated time together than the specific activity.

Travel: I have a passport and a few stamps on it (sadly, these aren't physical everywhere anymore). I am in a position where i can get PTO easily and have the disposable income to travel, within reason. I love visiting new areas and long-term plans around exploring this planet is something I value.",2,1746395732.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1keviul,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1keviul/men_what_makes_you_lose_interest_back_off_from_a/,"Men, what makes you lose interest / back off from a girl?","I (F) am interested in a guy I work with. I feel like we’ve been playful, flirting, walking that tightrope gray-zone of plausible deniability for a long time. We would go to lunch, coffee, or even do certain things that felt very date-like (at least for me), like a spontaneous walk to see the sea lions at the zoo. Light touches on my arm, shoulder, or back. Previously flirty/playful conversations even. Just lots of little  examples over 2 years.

Lately, I feel like he’s backed off. We don’t spend as much time together, he’s colder/more professional, etc. It’s just very clear that he has lost whatever interest was previously there (if any), etc. 

We have never openly discussed a relationship between us, much less this shift. We have never gone on any official dates or done anything physical. 

I feel like I hear all the time about how easy it is for women to date a guy that they want. Extended eye contact, a smile, an invitation to go somewhere or do an activity (much less more direct approaches too). 

But I don’t often hear about men rejecting a girl. Men, what causes you to lose interest and stop flirting with a girl? What has caused this kind of shift for you?

1kevgpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kevgpv/still_in_the_snow/,Still In The Snow,"Amanda woke immediately tense and tried to move. Failing to do so, she realized she was having another sleep paralysis episode—a common occurrence in her daily life at this point, but that never made it easier. Then her demon paid her a visit, a shadow in the shape of a man leaning over her. The mouth—or where it would be on the shadow—moved, gurgling the words, each one followed by a drip of black sludge from the shadow's mouth right onto her face.

""Tick tock, tick tock, tick to—""

The shadow faded as her alarm started beeping loudly, making Amanda sit up in her bed quickly. She turned off her alarm, feeling a cold sweat soaking her clothes.

""Fuck, it's getting worse,"" she mumbled to herself, tears almost filling her eyes as she got up and walked to the bathroom, opening up a pill bottle and taking two. Apparently, they were supposed to help stop sleep paralysis—in exchange for paranoia, anxiety, and occasionally hallucinations—but it helped. She had recently gotten a refill, a change of brand, so the pills looked different.

Just then, her phone rang. It was from her father, so she picked it up quickly.

""Hey, Dad,"" she spoke, sounding a bit tired with a hint of fear—the episode still affecting her—as she held the phone to her ear.

""Hi, Kiddo, you ready for the weekend trip to the family cabin in the mountains?""

Her father sounded excited; he always seemed to look forward to these trips even after all that had happened.

""Yeah, Dad, I'm looking forward to it. I finished packing my stuff last night, so I'll meet you there by noon.""

She walked back into her bedroom, holding her phone to her ear with her shoulder as she picked out her clothes for the day.

""Alright, honey, just be safe. The roads can get bad with the snow,"" her father said, sounding concerned.

""I know, Dad, don't worry. Bye.""

She hung up and got dressed, understanding his concern.

See, her mother had gotten lost years ago during a hike on the mountain. Amanda was young at the time—12 years old, to be exact. Her mother had gone on a hike while Amanda's dad watched her. She never came back. A blizzard started just hours after she left. Amanda's father couldn't do anything—he didn't want to leave her alone in the cabin but also knew it wasn't safe to search for his wife—so he called the police after the blizzard, hoping she would be found. They never did. The snow had covered any tracks and blocked many cave entrances.

Amanda could never forget that night. That's where she got her sleep paralysis demon—watching out the windows of that cabin, distant shadowy figures in the snow, and the ticking of the clock as the seconds passed.

Amanda had an aching feeling the reason her father loved going back there was because a small part of him still thought he would find her mother.

Amanda shut her eyes tight for a moment, bringing herself back to this exact moment, dressed in the outfit she had picked out.

""I really need to set an appointment with my therapist again. This shit is starting to get to me,"" she spoke aloud to herself, an attempt to remember to set it.

Amanda left the house shortly after, loaded up her car, and started her drive up the mountain.  
The drive was mostly normal, except Amanda felt the need to keep checking behind her—in the backseat—the constant feeling of someone watching her, or some presence in the backseat at least.

""It's just the pills' side effects,"" she reminded herself as she turned on the radio. Her therapist had suggested distractions and reminding herself it was just the pills.

Otherwise, the ride was fine. She arrived at the cabin quite quickly, parking her car next to her dad's red sedan.

Amanda exited her car, looking at the dusting of snow on the ground before heading inside, seeing her dad making coffee on the wood burner.

""I don't know how you drink that shit, it's so bitter,"" Amanda said.

Her father smiled as he heard her voice, looking over at Amanda.

""Well, unlike you, I don't get that sugary Starbucks shit every day.""

Amanda chuckled, setting down her bag on the table. She was always able to be more open with her father—curse in front of him, even insult him—and never got in trouble for it.

""Well, it tastes good, and I have the money for it. It's good to see you, Dad. I look forward to the weekend.""

Amanda's dad smiled and walked over to Amanda with his small mug of coffee.

""I'm glad you're looking forward to it. Could you bring in some more wood? It's supposed to get cold tonight and snow some more, so the more logs you can bring in, the better.""

Amanda nodded and spoke.  
""Yeah, sure, Dad. You're better with the wood burner than me anyway.""

She walked outside to the wood stack on the side of the cabin. Amanda began picking up the wood, stacking it against her chest and arm to carry more inside.

Suddenly, Amanda saw something out of the corner of her eye.  
She dropped the wood and turned to look at the shadowy figure she thought she saw, but it was gone.

""Just the pills,"" she repeated to herself, reminding herself it wasn't real, as she picked up the wood she dropped and carried it inside.

Amanda's dad looked at her as the door opened.  
""Are you alright? I thought I heard a bit of a ruckus out there.""

Amanda shut the door and set the logs next to the wood burner.  
""Yeah, I'm fine. Just dropped some of the wood,"" she said, not wanting to explain further and concern him.

""Alright, be more careful next time. Could break a toe if you drop it on your foot.""

She nodded at her father's warning, turning on the radio before laying down on the couch. The radio began playing Christmas music after the familiar local DJ, Jackie Spells, wished everyone a nice holiday season.

""You know, Amanda, your mother was close friends with that DJ,"" her father recalled as he stoked the fire.

""Really? I didn't know she was friends with him.""

Her father shut the wood burner and the latch before continuing.  
""Yeah, they were friends in high school before me and your mother started dating. Jackie was real broken up about it when he heard she went missing—mentioned it on the radio for like a month.""

This was news to Amanda. She hadn't even met Jackie when she was a kid, and her mom didn't seem like the type to be friends with a DJ, even a local one.

""Well, I guess she was more wild when she was younger than I thought.""

Her dad chuckled before he bundled up.  
""Well, I'm going to walk the trails. Would you like to join me?""

He walked to the door but paused, looking at her.

""No, I'll go on one tomorrow, but it's too cold for me today.""

Her dad left without much else to say, leaving her alone in the cabin.  
The only sounds were the wood burner, Christmas music, and her breathing.

Amanda shifted off the couch, walking over to a cooler and removing a beer from it—one her father had brought.

""One beer can't hurt,"" she mumbled to herself, remembering that she wasn't supposed to drink on her medications.

She cracked the can open, taking a sip, allowing the piss-like drink into her mouth. She never enjoyed the taste but didn't have many options at the moment.

""Fuck, I always forget how bad this tastes.""  
She took another sip before looking out the window, her eyes fixing on the horizon as the snow began to fall at a slightly increased pace.

Right before she took another sip, her eyes fixed on one of those fucking figures—features obscured by darkness—but even as she stared directly at it, the figure didn't disappear.

Amanda's heart started beating faster. She dropped the beer, only a few sips in, allowing it to spill onto the wood floor.

""That has to be someone,"" Amanda told herself, even though there were no other cabins nearby, and the hiking trail her father took wasn't anywhere close to where she saw the figure.

Amanda grabbed her coat, bundling up—her shoes were still on—as she ran outside shouting.

""Hey, you're not meant to be here! You're trespassing!""  
She shouted as the figure took off running at a very fast pace—seemed more like a deer or a track runner the way it moved.

Amanda followed. She wanted a good look at this thing.  
With each step, the snow got deeper—more and more debris, sticks, and rocks made it harder to give chase.

Amanda tripped, letting out a scream, but before she hit the snowy ground, everything went black for a moment.

Amanda shot up on the couch with a scream, her heart racing as she let out hurried breaths, looking around.

""It was a fucking nightmare?!"" she shouted—questioning, confused, and scared all at once—standing up off the couch, holding her head as she saw her coat still hung up.

""I can't... ugh,"" she struggled with her words for a moment as she reached into her pocket, dialing her doctor's number.

One ring.  
Two rings.  
Then a voice.

""Good afternoon, Dr. West's office. This is Emily speaking. How may I help you today?""

The receptionist's voice came over the phone, a slight relief to Amanda as she took another breath to calm down and speak properly.

""Hello, Emily, it's Amanda. I need to speak to Dr. West immediately. I don't give a fuck if he's a bit busy—I need to speak to him. So transfer me, or whatever you have to do. I have to speak to him.""

The receptionist heard the seriousness in Amanda's voice.

""Ma'am, please calm down. You're lucky he isn't busy—I'll transfer you over.""

A few moments of silence passed before a masculine voice came over the phone.

""Hello, this is Dr. West speaking.""

Amanda responded quickly.

""What the fuck were these meds you gave me, Doc? I'm seeing shit—stuff that ain't there—my dreams are feeling real, and let me tell you, a nightmare ain't fucking pleasant when it feels like you're really going through it.""

Amanda didn't really think out the words she was saying.

""Amanda, you ran out of refills two months ago. Where did you get those?""

Amanda quickly hung up her phone as memories flooded back into her head.  
How could she forget? Even in a panic she should have remembered—she had been buying the pills illegally from a pharmacist who had a thing for her.

As she started pacing, trying to calm herself down, she stepped in a sticky puddle by the window. Looking down, she saw the slightly yellow liquid.

""Beer?""

Her heart almost stopped beating in her chest as she stood frozen, staring out the window. More of those things stood there, it was getting darker, and the snow was picking up even more.

""It's a bad batch. It has to be a bad batch. I must be tripping. That asshole must have realized I wasn't into him and gave me a higher dose—something like that.""

She tried to calm herself down, reminding herself of her college bad weed trips—but those things she was staring at—those things were real. There was no changing that in her mind. And they were slowly getting closer to the cabin.

She stepped out of the beer puddle and threw on her jacket again.  
Only this time, she took off running on the trail her dad had taken earlier.

""Dad! Dad, where the fuck are you!""  
She shouted, tears pouring down her face as she ran. She could feel those things following her. She only stopped when she saw more of them ahead, blocking the path.

""Fuck, fuck, I can't—oh God.""

Amanda panicked, turning and running into the woods, shedding her jacket when it got caught on a branch. The cold immediately hit her—biting at her skin without protection—as she stumbled forward, noticing she didn't see the things chasing her anymore.

Shivering violently, she staggered through the trees until her blurry, frozen gaze caught sight of a cave entrance.

Without thinking, Amanda pushed through the brush and stumbled inside.  
Relief quickly turned to horror.

""M-Mom?""

The word slipped out, broken and small, as she spotted a frozen corpse. The skin was blue, one ear had fallen off at some point, but that hair—those clothes—that was her mother.

Amanda inched closer, reaching out with trembling fingers as if she could still check for a pulse.

A snap of a branch made her whip her head around.  
At the entrance of the cave, one of those things stood there, blocking her escape.

""No!""  
Amanda screamed, voice cracking in terror as she ran at the thing, trying to push past it—but before she could, snow collapsed from above the cave mouth, sealing her inside.

She clawed at the packed snow until her fingers were red and numb, each movement getting slower, weaker, until finally she stopped.

Defeated and shivering, Amanda walked back to her mother's frozen body.  
She curled up beside it, her tears freezing on her cheeks as her eyes drifted shut.

""I'm so sorry, Mom... I'm so sorry...""  
The words faded into the cold, swallowed by the dark.

I stared at it for a moment, and then it hit me, it was my ex. We broke up a while ago, but clearly, I didn’t realize I was this desperate to see what he was up to. 🤦‍♀️

I did what any rational person would do, I swiped right. I mean, it's been a while, maybe he's changed, right? 😂 Well, he swiped right too. And immediately, he messaged me with, “So, we’re doing this again?”

I froze. What do you even say to that? “Hey, just making sure you’re still alive?” ""LOL, let’s talk about how we both ended up here again""? 🙄

I panicked and unmatched him immediately. But the worst part? I didn’t even have time to unmatch before I saw his face at a coffee shop this morning. We literally locked eyes like two people who had just been in the most awkward Tinder match ever. I quickly turned around and pretended to check my phone.

After **5.9 hours** of crashing, I’m still trapped in the roof section—the *very beginning* of this game. (Yes, I’m basically the gaming equivalent of a hamster stuck in a wheel.) I pre-ordered this disaster, hyped up and ready to roll, and since then, it’s been a non-stop war just to get past the loading screen. Pre-ordering: the ultimate test of optimism—or a cruel reminder that hope is just future disappointment in disguise.

# DX12: The Dream Killer

There’s something seriously messed up with games running **DirectX 12 (DX12)** lately, and it’s breaking everything for tons of people—myself included. (DX12? More like DX-*Dozen Crashes Per Minute*, am I right?) Devs, listen up: optimization isn’t optional! I’m pretty sure these crashes, D3D hangs, and other digital gremlins stem from shoddy VRAM management. Slamming frame generation into a game and expecting it to purr like a kitten is like strapping a rocket to a tricycle and calling it a spaceship. Spoiler: it’s not cool, and it doesn’t work.

# My Fellow Victims: Other Games With Issues

I’ve hit similar roadblocks with *Atomic Heart*, *Hogwarts Legacy*, and *It Takes Two*. (Are they all Unreal Engine? Is UE just throwing a tantrum because it didn’t get enough coffee?) For *Atomic Heart* and *It Takes Two*, I managed to dodge the crash bullet by cranking the settings down to “glorified potato” mode. *Hogwarts Legacy*? I’m testing a fix that’s supposedly the same as for this game. (My PC’s now moonlighting as a repair shop, and it’s terrible at its job.)

# My Rig: The Overqualified Underperformer

Here’s the hardware I’m rocking—if you’re into spec flexing:

* **Model**: OMEN by HP Laptop 16-b0xxx (sounds slick, performs like a slug)
* **OS**: Windows 11 Pro 24H2 (updates always drop mid-crash, because of course they do)
* **CPU**: 11th Gen Intel Core i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz (fast on paper, snail in practice)
* **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070, 8GB VRAM (tried every driver under the sun, settled on 566.66 because it’s the least tantrum-prone)
* **RAM**: 64 GB (apparently, even 64 gigs can’t bribe this game into working)

I’ve stress-tested everything—CPU, GPU, and RAM—with **Prime95**, **OCCT**, **FurMark**, and **MemTest86**, running each overnight like some twisted tech endurance race. (My laptop’s basically a toaster with PTSD now.) Hardware’s fine, so the blame’s squarely on the game.

# Steam Forums: The Crash Club

Hop over to the Steam discussions for these games, and it’s a crash party—everyone’s invited! The golden nugget of advice floating around? Add the -dx11 parameter. For some games, it’s a magic wand. For *Expedition*? It’s a cursed spell that turns textures into abstract art and still crashes the game. (Thanks, -dx11, you’re the real MVP of disappointment.)

# A “Fix” That’s More Like a Punishment

I stumbled across a “solution” when *Hogwarts Legacy* started tanking after recent updates—possibly frame generation gone rogue, but who knows? Check this Reddit gem:  
  
[**Forcing the Game into DX11 Fixed Many FPS Issues**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryPotterGame/comments/10zbgou/forcing_the_game_into_dx11_fixed_many_fps_issues/)

(I need ""Force On"" otherwise it doesn't work"")  
I saw it, got hyped, and fired up **DXCPL** for *Expedition*. Surprise—it *worked*! (Cue the sarcastic confetti.) My setup’s locked in, but here’s the punchline: the game now chugs along at a majestic **20 FPS**. Dodging? Parrying? Nope, it’s a slideshow simulator. (I’ve seen faster action in a sloth yoga class.)

# The Piracy Plot Twist

Here’s the kicker: I played a pirated copy of *Hogwarts Legacy* (early release) and it ran like butter—no crashes, pure bliss. Then I went legit, snagged it from Green Man Gaming with the latest patch, and now it’s unplayable. (Piracy: 1, Honesty: 0.) I debated pirating *Expedition* too—it’s insanely pricey here in Brazil—but I forked over the cash in 6x installments because I adore turn-based games and wanted to support the devs. Now? I’m stranded until I upgrade my rig. (My wallet’s sobbing, and my laptop’s mocking me.)

# My Troubleshooting Odyssey: A Comedy of Errors

Before you drop some “miracle fix” in the comments, brace yourself—here’s the laundry list of everything I’ve tried. (I’m basically a one-man tech support sitcom at this point):

* **OS Swapapalooza**: Tested on Linux (because why not?), Win 10, Win 10 LTSC, Win 11 Pro, Win 11 LTSC—all fresh installs. (My SSD’s seen more reboots than a sci-fi time loop.)
* **Driver Roulette**: NVIDIA drivers via **DDU**—576.02, 576.28, 566.66, 566.14, 552.44, 471.68 (the oldest in **NVCleanstall**, because desperation’s my co-pilot). Even tried full installs with the NVIDIA app on 566.66 and 576.28. (Still crashing faster than my dreams.)
* **Steam’s False Hope**: Verified game files. Steam: “All good!” Game: “Hold my crash log.”
* **Settings Shuffle**: Lowest, medium, highest settings, every upscaler, VSync on/off, fullscreen, windowed, borderless. (I’ve seen more graphics options than a buffet menu, none labeled “Stop Crashing.”)
* **Mod Madness**: Used **OptiScaler** (saved *Atomic Heart* kinda), swapped DLSS for FSR with **Nukem’s mod**. (Crashes kept coming like uninvited guests.)
* **Windows Tweaks**: Disabled GPU acceleration, ran as admin, killed fullscreen optimizations. (Windows shrugged, game laughed.)
* **Power Play**: Undervolted with **Throttlestop**, tweaked core ratios, tried **XTU**, overclocked and undervolted via **MSI Afterburner**. (My laptop’s a science fair project gone wrong.)
* **Deep Clean**: Full laptop teardown, repasted, new thermal pads. (It’s pristine, but still a crash magnet.)
* **Save Scapegoat**: Thought it was my save file. Fired up **GeForce Now**, waited behind 700+ people (longer than my grandma’s grocery line), and it ran fine. Not the save. (Cloud gaming’s just flexing now.)

I’m stuck on the roof, my RTX 3070’s sulking, and my 64 GB of RAM is just sitting there judging me. (At this point, I’m tempted to trade it all for a Game Boy—it’d crash less.)

I have tried many supplements in the past, but none have made such a dramatic impact on my overall well-being like PrimeBiome. If you're someone who struggles with digestive discomfort, bloating, or low energy, I can’t recommend this product enough. I’m here to share my experience with PrimeBiome, and I promise you’ll understand why I believe it’s a must-try for anyone seeking to improve their gut health.

My Struggle with Gut Issues



For years, I struggled with digestive issues—constant bloating, irregular digestion, and an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach after every meal. It wasn’t just physical discomfort; the ongoing issues also left me feeling sluggish, moody, and mentally foggy. I tried everything: diet changes, exercise, various over-the-counter supplements, and even prescribed medications, but nothing seemed to truly solve the problem.



My energy levels were often low, and I could never shake the feeling of heaviness after eating. It wasn’t until I started feeling more discomfort, including occasional cramps, that I realized I needed a solution that went deeper than just masking symptoms. I wanted something that could actually help restore my gut health and overall vitality. That’s when I discovered PrimeBiome.



First Impressions: What Makes PrimeBiome Different?



PrimeBiome immediately stood out to me for a few reasons. First, the ingredients list caught my eye. The product is packed with multiple strains of probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes. These elements are crucial for gut health because they not only replenish the beneficial bacteria in your gut but also support the process of digestion and absorption of nutrients.



What I particularly loved about PrimeBiome was its high-quality formula. It’s not just another generic probiotic with one or two strains. Instead, PrimeBiome combines 10 powerful strains that have been scientifically proven to support digestion, boost immunity, and balance gut flora. The product is also free from artificial additives and preservatives, which is a huge bonus for me since I prefer supplements that are as natural as possible.



Week 1: Noticeable Improvements in Digestion



I started taking PrimeBiome with a sense of cautious optimism. The first week was more about giving my body time to adjust to the new supplement. Initially, I didn’t experience a drastic change, but I did notice a slight reduction in bloating. I didn’t feel as heavy after meals, and that persistent fullness was beginning to fade.



The biggest thing I noticed during the first week was how consistent my digestion became. In the past, I would often feel discomfort or bloating after eating certain foods, but I was surprised to find that I wasn’t experiencing those issues nearly as often. For the first time in a long while, my stomach felt calmer, and I wasn’t dealing with the usual digestive disruptions.



Week 2: Energy Boost and Mental Clarity



By the end of week two, I was starting to feel much more energized. In fact, I was waking up feeling more refreshed than I had in months. I typically struggled with low energy in the mornings and would rely heavily on coffee to get through the day, but after two weeks of taking PrimeBiome, I found that I wasn’t needing my usual caffeine fix.



On top of the physical changes, I also noticed my mental clarity improving. It’s incredible how much your gut health affects your brain function. I no longer felt foggy or sluggish during the day, and I was able to focus better at work and in conversations. It was like a mental reset.



One thing I’ve learned is that gut health doesn’t just impact digestion—it has a profound effect on your mood and mental wellness. PrimeBiome helped me experience this shift, and I could feel my mood lifting as my gut health improved. It was a relief to finally feel “normal” again, with consistent energy and no more digestive problems hanging over my head.



Week 3: Bloating and Discomfort Are Gone



By week three, I could confidently say that PrimeBiome had changed my life. The bloating and discomfort I had dealt with for years were gone, and I could eat without fear of feeling bloated or heavy afterward. Whether it was a salad, a protein-packed meal, or a more indulgent dish, my digestive system was handling it all effortlessly.



What really stood out to me was how natural the results felt. There was no quick fix or drastic change, just a steady, consistent improvement. Over time, my gut microbiome was becoming balanced, and I could tell because I was feeling lighter, more energetic, and more in tune with my body.



I wasn’t expecting such a comprehensive transformation, but I realized that PrimeBiome wasn’t just addressing one symptom—it was providing holistic gut support, from digestion to immunity to overall well-being.



Why PrimeBiome Is Different: The Science Behind It



So what makes PrimeBiome so effective? It’s all about the powerful ingredients and scientific formulation. PrimeBiome contains 10 carefully chosen probiotic strains, each selected for their ability to support various aspects of gut health. Some of the standout strains include:



Lactobacillus acidophilus: Helps to balance the gut microbiome and improve digestion.



Bifidobacterium longum: Known for its ability to support digestive regularity and promote a healthy gut lining.



Saccharomyces boulardii: A beneficial yeast that helps reduce bloating and support immune function.



Additionally, PrimeBiome includes prebiotics, which are non-digestible fibers that feed beneficial gut bacteria, and digestive enzymes to aid in food breakdown and nutrient absorption. The combination of these elements makes PrimeBiome a comprehensive and potent solution for digestive and gut health.



No More Guesswork—PrimeBiome Does the Work for You



What truly sets PrimeBiome apart is its holistic approach to gut health. Many supplements only target one aspect of digestion, but PrimeBiome covers all the bases—probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes work together to restore balance in the gut, improve digestion, and even enhance your immune system.



Unlike many other probiotic supplements that only contain one or two strains of bacteria, PrimeBiome is designed to give your body everything it needs to optimize gut function. Whether you’re dealing with bloating, irregular digestion, or low energy, PrimeBiome tackles the root cause by supporting your body’s natural processes.



The Final Verdict: You Need to Try PrimeBiome



If you’ve been struggling with gut health, digestive issues, or low energy, PrimeBiome is an absolute game-changer. It’s not a quick fix—it’s a comprehensive solution that will leave you feeling healthier, more energized, and more comfortable in your body.

If you're reading this, you're probably like me just a few months ago — frustrated, bloated, and desperate for real gut relief. Let me be 100% honest: I was skeptical about Prime Biome. I’ve wasted money on “gut health” supplements in the past that either did nothing or made things worse. But something about Prime Biome’s claims, reviews, and science-backed ingredients made me give it one last shot. And I’m so glad I did.

This is my real and raw experience with Prime Biome. I’m not a doctor, I’m not paid to write this, and I’ve definitely had my fair share of complaints. But after using Prime Biome for 120 days straight, I can confidently say this product changed my life — and in this review, I’ll break down:



My personal gut struggles



What happened in the first 7, 30, and 90 days



Real complaints I had (and how they were resolved)



Why I believe this is the only gut health supplement worth your time in 2025



🔍 Why I Even Tried Prime Biome (My Story)

For over a decade, I battled daily bloating, gas, constipation, and random food sensitivities. I tried clean eating, probiotics, herbal teas, intermittent fasting — nothing gave me long-lasting relief. Doctors would tell me it's ""just IBS"" or “stress-related,” but I knew something deeper was going on in my gut.



After seeing a gut health video on YouTube where a woman swore by Prime Biome, I searched for reviews and came across a few that mentioned “real results.” Still skeptical, I dug into the ingredients and was shocked by what I found:



Soil-based probiotics (SBOs) that survive stomach acid



Bacillus coagulans — clinically shown to improve gut flora



Turmeric extract for inflammation



Digestive enzymes



And no fillers, gluten, or artificial junk



I ordered the 3-bottle pack (because the 1-bottle price was higher per unit) and told myself: “Let’s see if this does anything.”



🗓️ My Results: Day 1 to Day 120

Week 1: The Detox Phase

I'll be honest — the first few days weren’t magical. In fact, I felt slightly more bloated, which made me nervous. But I remembered reading that gut rebalancing sometimes causes temporary discomfort. By Day 5, my digestion felt lighter, and my morning bathroom trip wasn’t a battle anymore.



Week 2–4: Less Bloating, Better Sleep

By the end of the first month, I noticed something huge — my cravings were disappearing. I didn’t feel the urge to binge sugar or salty snacks. I was sleeping deeper, and my stomach looked visibly flatter. I even lost 3 lbs without changing my diet.



Month 2: Energy, Regularity & Skin Changes

This was the turning point. I felt more energized in the morning, less foggy, and my skin (which always broke out during my cycle) looked clearer. My digestion was consistent, and I didn’t dread meals anymore. I finally felt in control of my gut.



Month 3–4: Long-Term Transformation

This is where Prime Biome really proved itself. I could eat out without fear. My mood swings decreased. I was going to the gym regularly. My body felt like it was finally absorbing nutrients the right way.



⚠️ My Complaints — And Honest Thoughts

Let’s be real — no product is perfect. I had a few issues, and here they are:



The Price At first, I thought it was expensive. But when I broke it down, I realized I was spending more on antacids, snacks (to “soothe” my gut), and other supplements that did nothing. The cost per day is about $1.60 — less than a coffee.



Initial Detox Symptoms The first few days of discomfort scared me, but Prime Biome’s team explained it’s normal. It passed quickly, and looking back, it was my body adjusting to real gut healing.



It’s Not Sold in Stores I wish it was in Walgreens or Whole Foods. But I guess the company wants to control quality and avoid fakes. That’s why I only buy from their \[official website\] — fast shipping and fresh stock.

If you’ve ever struggled with:



Chronic bloating



Inconsistent bowel movements



Brain fog and fatigue



Sugar cravings



Skin breakouts linked to gut issues



Anxiety or mood swings...



… then Prime Biome could be the missing piece.



This is not just another probiotic — it’s a scientifically formulated gut repair system that works with your body, not against it. The soil-based organisms, enzyme blend, and anti-inflammatory agents are what make it unique.



And here’s the kicker — it comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee. So even if it doesn’t work for you, there’s zero risk.



⭐ Final Verdict: Is Prime Biome Worth It?

Yes. A thousand times YES.



I’ve tried over 12 gut products in the last 5 years. None of them made a difference long-term. Prime Biome is the only supplement that delivered visible, emotional, and digestive transformation — and continues to work 4 months in.



Don’t waste another year feeling sluggish, bloated, and helpless.



This is your sign to take control of your gut health today — your body will thank you, your mind will feel clearer, and you’ll wonder why you didn’t try it sooner.

I was tired all the time.



My focus was fading.



My joints ached.



I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.



And worst of all, I was starting to lose my confidence.



Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted real answers and a real solution.



That’s when I discovered MITOLYN – a supplement designed to restore mitochondrial health (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.



⚡ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function — which influences energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance, and even longevity.



Key benefits they promise:



Boost energy naturally



Improve focus and brain performance



Support healthy weight management



Reduce joint pain and inflammation



Fight cellular aging



To be honest, it felt like a too-good-to-be-true checklist. But I gave it a shot.



🔬 What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the premium, research-backed ingredients that target real cellular health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.



Some of the star ingredients include:



CoQ10 – Supports cellular energy and heart health



PQQ – Promotes the growth of new mitochondria



Acetyl-L-Carnitine – Improves mental clarity and memory



Alpha Lipoic Acid – Fights oxidative stress



Resveratrol – Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties



Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12 – Essential for energy production



Together, these ingredients form a synergistic formula that targets the root cause of fatigue and aging — mitochondrial decline.



✅ My 30-Day MITOLYN Experience: What Changed?

I took MITOLYN exactly as instructed — 2 capsules every morning with water. Here's what happened week by week:



✅ Week 1:

Slight increase in morning energy



Clearer mental focus during work



No crash in the afternoon like before



✅ Week 2:

Woke up before my alarm — feeling refreshed



Digestion felt smoother



Less brain fog



I started to feel “lighter”



✅ Week 3:

My energy levels felt stable and strong all day



I could focus better at work for longer periods



My workouts improved — less joint pain



I noticed a mood boost too — more optimistic



✅ Week 4:

I felt like I got my younger self back



I stopped reaching for coffee



My weight dropped by 3 pounds



I felt clear-headed, more active, and even happier



💥 Real Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN

After one month, here’s what changed drastically:



⚡ Energy: I went from drained to dynamic. No coffee needed.



🧠 Focus: Mental clarity and attention improved big time.



🔥 Metabolism: My body felt more active. I started burning fat faster.



💪 Recovery: Faster post-gym recovery and less soreness.



🦴 Joint Relief: Pain in my knees and wrists almost disappeared.



✨ Overall Mood: I feel mentally sharper and emotionally lighter.



😬 MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know

No review is honest without mentioning the downsides — and yes, MITOLYN has a few:



1. Not Instant

You won’t feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn’t a “quick fix” — it’s a science-backed long-term upgrade.



2. Premium Price

It’s not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact — it’s worth the investment.



3. Limited Stock

This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN sells out often. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2–3 bottles upfront.



💯 Is MITOLYN Worth It in 2025?

Absolutely, yes.

If you’re:



Feeling constantly tired



Struggling with brain fog or poor memory



Battling joint pain



Gaining unwanted weight



Or just feel like you're “aging too fast”



Then MITOLYN can literally be the missing piece in your daily routine.



Unlike cheap energy boosters, MITOLYN works deep inside your cells to fix what’s broken. That’s why the results are real and lasting.



🔐 Final Verdict: Should You Buy MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not a gimmick.

It’s a premium, advanced mitochondria support supplement that delivers real results. I’ve tried dozens of products over the years — but nothing has made me feel this recharged, balanced, and confident.



If you’re serious about taking control of your health in 2025 — MITOLYN is the #1 product I recommend. Period.

In 2015 Notre shop released a Viberg collab where they made some Icy Mocha Chromexcel service boots with [burlap from coffee bags](https://www.notre-shop.com/blogs/news/80593414-viberg-x-notre-coffee-pack?srsltid=AfmBOoqrhtLVbLas3R5m_L21CUsgcqjAe5_aOS534CRDRL-5hkpJcqSu) glued onto the sole. It made a bit of a splash at the time and I always liked the vibe of the boot. Last year an unworn pair in my size showed up on Grailed somehow and I grabbed them. A lot to like, but I really didn't dig the sole. Not only was it a bit beefy for my taste, it turns out that burlap is not commonly used on the soles of boots for several good reasons. Unless you are piloting a hot air balloon as part of your job at a Renaissance festival, boots do not need gimmicks. I also could not be near dogs in these. Because dogs could smell everything I had ever walked through from the beginning of time. These were an encyclopedia to dogs. Every dog in the neighborhood was like, ""Hey! \[sniffs burlap again\] You know my uncle!""

Inspired by [this Wyatt & Dad Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/procobblers/p/DF6hxg5MjCK/?img_index=3) of a Viberg resole, I took them to [Mend Atelier](https://www.instagram.com/mendatelier/?hl=en) in Chicago, a newish cobbler that happens to be right around the corner from the place that makes [Venetian Shoe Cream](https://www.instagram.com/varnu/p/B45dI8UpKFn/?hl=en). 

I asked them to put a leather sole on the boots, lower the heel a bit and put a Cuban-ish slope on the back. He did a good job and these are now something I'm a lot more likely to want to put on. 

The 2045 last has Munson-like toe that looked a little too substantial when it has a thick heel under it. The easer to bend leather sole means there's a little more toe spring now, which adds some panache to the look. And the lower, less blocky heel doesn't dominate the side profile. I've always felt that soles contribute more to the look of a boot than most people credit and I think this is good evidence in support of that.",11,1746395184.0,goodyearwelt,0,1.0,False

We’ve had a pretty solid relationship overall... some ups and downs, but nothing wild. Until this.

A few weeks ago, I started getting DMs from a new account... no followers, generic posts, profile pic of a model (which should’ve been the first red flag). The messages were flirty but not explicit. Just stuff like “You seem like someone who’s hard to forget,” and “You’ve got this mysterious energy.”

I was suspicious, but I played along. Not in a “cheating” way... I never said I was single, I didn’t give away personal info. I mostly wanted to see where it would go. But the weird part? This “girl” knew a lot about me. Stuff I never posted publicly. Favorite coffee shop. The exact phrase I used once while drunk ranting. Inside jokes that only my girlfriend would know.

So I started to piece it together... and eventually, I confronted her. She admitted it. Said she created the account to “test my loyalty,” and that she was “curious how I’d respond to someone who was obviously into me.”

I thought we’d laugh it off. Instead, she got pissed. Said I “flirted too easily” and that she “didn’t like how natural I was at it.”

I’m sitting here like… what did you expect?? You catfished me and now you’re mad I didn’t pass your imaginary purity test?

We haven’t talked in two days. She’s still upset. I feel like this is a massive trust issue... but maybe I did mess up by not shutting it down immediately?

I don't know what to do.

The Kismile 643108e8-261c-4fb7-b941-ba6199c3d37b Espresso Machine caught my attention as soon as I unboxed it. Its sleek black finish paired with the stainless steel accents gives it an upscale, professional appearance. This machine looks right at home on my kitchen countertop, and the compact design ensures it doesn’t hog too much space. At 11.5""D x 13.03""W x 16.1""H, it fits neatly into tight corners while still feeling substantial. The sturdy frame inspires confidence about its durability, and every button and knob feels satisfyingly tactile. I’ve had guests admire its aesthetics and even ask if I had recently opened a café. The careful attention to detail in the design makes it clear that aesthetics were given as much thought as functionality—a rare combination in espresso machines at this price.

**Ease of Operation at Your Fingertips**

This espresso maker is remarkably user-friendly. Its semi-automatic operation simplifies a process that might otherwise seem overwhelming to non-baristas like myself. With the built-in programming options, I was able to customize single or double cup output sizes with just a few simple adjustments. The inclusion of clearly labeled buttons, a labeled knob for switching between steaming and brewing modes, and an intuitive display make the learning curve almost non-existent. Adjusting variables such as grind size, water temperature, and the coffee dose has never felt less intimidating—and I say that as someone who used to break out into a sweat at the thought of espresso calibration.

**[Check Kismile 643108e8-261c-4fb7-b941-ba6199c3d37b price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0djxqldj5/)**

**Built-in Grinder for Freshness**

Having a precision conical burr grinder built into the system was an absolute game-changer for me. With 30 preset grind settings, I could tweak the coffee grounds to achieve the exact texture I wanted for different styles of brews. Switching from a fine grind suitable for straight espresso to a coarser grind for an Americano proved easy. Grinding beans freshly right before brewing unlocked the most sensational aromas that filled my kitchen and increased the flavor intensity of my coffee. Not to mention, not having to buy and maintain a separate grinder eliminated extra hassle. Any coffee connoisseur knows how vital freshly ground beans are for that rich, unbeatable flavor, and this machine delivered without compromise.

**Milk Frother: Café-Quality at Home**

The milk frother left very little to be desired. I decided to test out its cappuccino and latte-making capabilities on a lazy Saturday morning, and the results were delightful. With its high-pressure steam wand attachment, creamy and smooth microfoam was whipped up effortlessly. I even experimented with different types of milk—soy, almond, and oat—and found consistent frothing results each time. The wand doubles as a hot water dispenser, meaning it can go beyond lattes into preparing everything from hot chocolate to instant ramen (yes, I tried that too). Cleaning the wand was almost too easy—switching it to the hot water mode ensured that residue didn’t linger and ruin the experience.

**Positives**

- Compact yet visually appealing design.
- Built-in grinder with 30 settings ensures freshness and versatility.
- Semi-automatic operation simplifies brewing.
- High-pressure frother creates creamy microfoam for lattes and cappuccinos.

**Negatives**

- A minor challenge lies in beginners needing time to master perfect grind and brew combinations.
- The machine requires consistent maintenance and cleaning (but this is standard for most coffee machines, so keep that in mind).

**Alternative Offerings**

There’s no denying that other brands like Breville and De'Longhi compete heavily in the semi-automatic espresso machine segment. Where the Kismile model shines is its affordability and deep feature set. Breville offers similar compact builds, but their machines are often priced quite a bit higher and don’t always include a grinder. De'Longhi products boast reliable milk frothers, but in terms of extraction pressure, the 20-bar pump in the Kismile machine has consistently delivered more robust taste notes, in my experience. While some may opt for more premium brands with greater recognition, this espresso maker delivers comparable results at a more tempting price.

**Price Worthiness and Final Thoughts**

The most remarkable thing about this espresso machine is how much it offers for its price. It manages to strike a fine balance between high functionality and affordability. It’s important to note that prices fluctuate, and certain features might come in higher-end designs—but for my investment, I’m confident this was worth every penny. It elevates the morning coffee ritual into a culinary delight without stripping my wallet bare. I haven’t stopped bragging about how much I’ve saved on trips to the local café.

1keva94,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1keva94,Scam advertisements,"I see a lot of people posting scams still. Last year I fell for a scam on Mercari. It was a great learning process in that it showed me what to look for to not get scammed. I did get my 800 something dollars back eventually.

The pictures I posted above are what I had learn from my experience. One was an interaction where I asked the seller to put my username on a Post-it note on the box they were shipping the ""machine""in, simply to prove that it really did exist the way they said it did.

You can see that the ""seller "" was unable to do something simple the way I had requested. Then after explaining to them why they disappeared.

The last two pictures are the machine that I ended up buying from a legitimate seller. They put my email address on a Post-it note on the box and then several days later after sending the money, the UPS guy is wheeling it into my garage for me. 

If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. When you communicate with a potential seller, they should be very happy to help you buy their equipment without playing any games. They should also not ask you for a deposit if you are going to go meet them somewhere to pick the machine up. Last year when I was going to buy a 64 mm flat burn grinder, I drove 45 miles to meet the seller. 

They texted me and told me they were at a meeting and would be in touch soon. I went out for lunch, had a nice time, then texted them back. They told me they forgot they were going to sell the machine and had other plans. I ended up having to block the bum and ended up driving back home. 

Again, this wasn't a total loss! It showed me how people respond when they're going to scam, plus I ended up getting a really good bowl of pho and a decent iced coffee.",3,1746395024.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

One of the earliest promises of cryptocurrency was revolutionizing payments, and in 2025, this is steadily becoming a reality, albeit with nuances.

* **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transactions:** Sending money directly to another person, anywhere in the world, without traditional banking intermediaries remains a core use case. This is especially valuable for international remittances, potentially offering lower fees and faster settlement times compared to legacy systems.
* **Merchant Adoption:** While not yet ubiquitous, a growing number of online and even brick-and-mortar businesses are accepting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins (cryptos pegged to fiat currency like the US dollar) as payment. This is often facilitated by crypto payment processors that handle the conversion for the merchant.
* **Micropayments:** The low transaction costs associated with certain cryptocurrencies make them suitable for micropayments online, potentially supporting content creators or enabling new pay-per-use models for digital services.
* **Stablecoins for Stability:** Volatility remains a concern for everyday payments. Stablecoins offer a solution, providing the benefits of crypto (speed, low fees) with the price stability of traditional currencies, making them increasingly popular for transactions.

# Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Reshaping Financial Services

Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is arguably one of the most impactful areas where cryptocurrency is used in 2025. DeFi aims to recreate traditional financial systems (lending, borrowing, insurance, trading) using blockchain technology and smart contracts, eliminating the need for central authorities like banks.

Key DeFi applications include:

* **Lending & Borrowing:** You can lend your crypto assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing crypto collateral, all governed by automated smart contracts.
* **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs):** Trade digital assets directly with other users without needing a central exchange to hold your funds.
* **Yield Farming & Staking:** Earn rewards by providing liquidity to DeFi protocols or by ""staking"" (locking up) certain cryptocurrencies to help secure their networks.
* **Stablecoin Integration:** Stablecoins are crucial in DeFi, acting as a stable medium of exchange and store of value within the ecosystem.
* **Insurance Alternatives:** Decentralized insurance protocols are emerging, allowing users to pool risk and provide coverage for smart contract failures or other crypto-specific risks.

While still evolving and carrying risks, DeFi demonstrates crypto's potential to create more open, accessible, and transparent financial services.



# NFTs and the Evolution of Digital Ownership

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) burst onto the scene primarily associated with digital art. In 2025, their use cases have broadened significantly, focusing on verifiable digital ownership and unique asset representation.

* **Digital Collectibles & Art:** This remains a prominent use case, providing artists with new ways to monetize their work and collectors with verifiable proof of ownership.
* **Gaming:** NFTs represent in-game items (skins, characters, virtual land) that players truly own and can potentially trade across different platforms or sell on secondary markets.
* **Ticketing:** Event tickets issued as NFTs can combat fraud and scalping, providing verifiable proof of authenticity and potentially enabling controlled resale.
* **Memberships & Loyalty Programs:** Brands and communities use NFTs to grant access to exclusive content, perks, or voting rights, creating new engagement models.
* **Tokenization of Real-World Assets:** While still in early stages, experiments are underway to represent ownership of real-world assets (like real estate or luxury goods) as NFTs on the blockchain, potentially simplifying transfers and fractional ownership.
* **Digital Identity Elements:** Aspects of personal identity or credentials could potentially be represented as non-transferable NFTs, giving individuals more control over their data.

NFTs in 2025 are less about hype and more about leveraging their uniqueness and transparency for diverse ownership applications.

# Enhancing Supply Chain Management & Transparency

Blockchain technology, powered by cryptocurrencies (often used for transaction fees or specific functions within the chain), offers significant advantages for supply chain management.

* **Traceability:** Track goods from origin to destination with an immutable record. Consumers can verify the authenticity and journey of products (e.g., confirming fair-trade coffee origins or tracking pharmaceuticals).
* **Transparency:** All stakeholders in the supply chain can access a shared, trusted ledger, reducing disputes and improving efficiency.
* **Efficiency:** Smart contracts can automate processes like triggering payments upon confirmed delivery or verifying certifications.

Companies are increasingly exploring blockchain to improve accountability and trust in their supply chains, and cryptocurrencies often play a functional role within these systems.



# Emerging Frontiers: Identity, Governance, and More

Beyond the major categories, cryptocurrencies and blockchain are fostering innovation in other areas:

* **Decentralized Identity (DID):** Efforts are underway to create self-sovereign identity systems where individuals control their digital identities using blockchain, rather than relying on centralized providers. Cryptographic keys are central to this.
* **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):** Organizations governed by code and community consensus, often using native tokens for voting on proposals and managing treasuries.
* **Creator Economies:** Enabling direct payments and new monetization models for content creators, bypassing traditional platforms.
* **Voting Systems:** Experimental use in secure and transparent voting, though widespread adoption faces challenges.

These areas highlight the ongoing exploration of crypto's potential beyond pure finance.



# The Foundational Role of Blockchain

It's crucial to remember that most of these cryptocurrency uses are powered by the underlying **blockchain technology**. Blockchain provides the secure, transparent, and often decentralized ledger that makes these applications possible. Understanding how blockchain works is key to grasping the true potential and limitations of various cryptocurrency applications.

# Conclusion

So, what is cryptocurrency used for in 2025? It's clear that the answer extends far beyond speculation. From streamlining global payments and building alternative financial systems with DeFi, to revolutionizing digital ownership with NFTs and enhancing supply chain transparency, cryptocurrencies and their associated technologies are carving out significant real-world utility.

While challenges around regulation, scalability, and user experience remain, the trajectory is towards increased integration and practical application. The crypto space in 2025 is less about getting rich quick and more about building functional, decentralized systems that offer tangible benefits across various industries. The focus has shifted towards sustainable use cases powered by the innovation of blockchain.

1kev8n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenrelationships/comments/1kev8n5/myf18_exm17_10_months_later_apologized_and_wants/,My(F18) ex(M17) (10 months later) apologized and wants to be friends – maybe more in the future. Am I seriously considering it?,"So. About ten months ago, my ex (then 16, I had just turned 18 – yes, yes, I know) broke up with me out of the blue. No warning. One day we’re cuddling and watching movies, the next he’s decided – with the confidence of a man twice his age and none of the life experience – that our relationship is a “distraction” from his mental health journey and needs to go.

Yes of course I was sad he wanted to brake up with me, but I was so mad that I didn’t get any say in it. No conversation, no pause, no “can we try a different approach?” Just BOOM: “I have decided. It is over.” I could just sit there (sobbing like a real girl boss) and helplessly watch him tare appart everything we had built up. 

It sucked sooo much. He was my first real relationship. First kiss. I was all in. And while we had issues (immaturity, lack of communication, him treating my favorite movie like an annoying YouTube ad), I didn’t think that was how it would end.

Anyway, he distanced himself from me, unfollowed from instagram and we’ve only seen each other at church since. I’ve been civil. Friendly, even. But since it was him who took a step back, it was up to him to decide where we stood now. And it was kinda far appart and not much more then awkward nods and polite ”all good?” ”yes, what about you?” ”I’m good”. Yeah…

That was until a few days ago. Out of nowhere, he follows me again on Instagram and sends me a message: “Hey, can I ask you something?” And I’m like…huhhh??

Turns out he wants to talk to me about some things so we got coffee, and he told me he’s felt like shit and been meaning to apologize since November. He said he was selfish, thought only of himself, treated me poorly, and deeply regretted how he handled both the relationship and the breakup. He admitted he was too ashamed to talk to me until now.

Then he asks if we could be friends again. And maybe, way down the line, when we’re Real Adults™ with jobs and emotional maturity, maybe see if something more could happen between us – if we reconnect on a deeper level.

So here’s the dilemma:
I’m not heartbroken anymore. I’ve healed. But I still care about him. I still think he’s cute. And I miss the good parts we had. There’s definitely some part of me that wants to believe in second chances. But also… I promised myself I wouldn’t go back. And I TOLD HIM when he was braking up with me ”then this is goodbye forever, because you cant just come back like nothing happend”. And I stand by that, that the version of him I dated is not someone I’d ever take back. Am I betraying myself just by considering this?

He says he’s changed. He wants to prove it. And I want to believe that people grow. But how do I even navigate this?
Can you actually be friends with someone you loved without slipping back into old patterns?
Is it stupid to even entertain this “maybe someday” fantasy?
How do I protect myself and keep an open mind?

1kev43n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anemic/comments/1kev43n/my_detailed_and_honest_iron_infusion_experience/,My detailed and honest iron infusion experience,"I’ve posted a lot in the sub about my infusion experience, but I wanted to summarize it in one post. If you go to my post history, you can see more.

Before anything else, let me say this: I am not trying to discourage anyone from getting iron infusions. For some people, they can be life-changing or even necessary. But I also think it’s important to hear real experiences, especially the hard parts. This is mine.

How It Started
A few months ago, I was exhausted, dizzy, foggy, and feeling generally awful. Bloodwork confirmed iron deficiency anemia:

Iron Saturation: 5%
	
Ferritin: 7.72 ng/mL

Hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dL

TIBC: 541 mcg/dL

MCV: 75.0

Supplements weren’t working fast enough, and I asked for iron infusions. My doctor agreed. She didn’t believe my Nexium use was to blame, since I had normal B12 and vitamin D levels (which are often low if Nexium is the root cause).

I received five 200mg Venofer infusions over two weeks.

If I could go back, I’d space them out. I didn’t know better, and no one warned me.

Side effects I experienced:

The infamous “iron flu” (hot flashes, chills, body aches, dizziness, nausea)

Metallic taste (coffee and cherry Luden’s helped)

Unpredictable digestion—diarrhea one day, constipation the next

Bloating, fluid retention

Extreme appetite increase—even Adderall didn’t suppress it

Rapid weight gain (13–14 lbs since November)

Wild daily weight fluctuations

I’m not sweating much during workouts anymore

Constant puffiness—like a tick about to pop
	
The mental toll of that weight gain is brutal. I used to feel confident, especially after maintaining my weight through years of intermittent fasting and workouts. Now I’m constantly uncomfortable, dressing around what still fits, and panicking at the thought of swimsuits or shorts.

My numbers did improve. I’ve been taking iron supplements every other day now, plus Ancestral Supplements Blood Builder (which I don’t take daily anymore—it’s just too much long-term). 

Ferritin went from 7 to 154

Iron saturation went from 5 to 16

My resting heart rate dropped from around 65 to 58–60, and my heart rate recovery improved noticeably. I’m exercising again. My energy is back. I’ve been going on walks and slowly lifting weights. So yes—my body is stronger now.

Iron infusions helped my numbers. But they also triggered weight gain, water retention, a disrupted relationship with food, and body image struggles that I’m still dealing with. I’ve had to buy new clothes, and going out in anything other than sweatpants requires more emotional energy than I care to admit.

According to Happy Scale, I have: 

Gained 4.2 pounds in 7 days

Gained 4.6 in 30 days

Gained 9.8 in 90 days

I feel like the infusions wrecked my body. All this way gains in my stomach and my thighs and my arms. I have so many stretch marks on my thighs. It looks like I was mauled by Freddy Krueger and a tiger. I know stretch marks don’t always come with pregnancy, but you would think that I had had like five kids at this point by the amount of stretch marks I have. 

Mentally, I’m not okay and will not do them again. If I had known this would happen I would’ve absolutely never requested them. My doctor was not concerned about the weight gain and says she thinks it will stabilize. This was very odd because I’ve had a doctors tell me for years that I’m fat. At this point, I don’t think it’s gonna come off. If it doesn’t, I will likely seek out weight loss drugs. Before this happened, I was 6 pounds away from my goal weight.

My appetite has decreased some, and I have started fasting again.

Hi guys! I (26F) have had a crush (28M) for a while now but couldn’t make a first move to ask him on a coffee or small break with me at uni.

We had a lot of conversation already about things that were surface level, uni, but even more deep. After having these deep convos, I felt like he was becoming distance for some reason, and I kinda let it go. 

But then, last week, I had to leave the class during the in-between break to attend something else, and I saw that he was sitting in the very back of the classroom, aka near the exit. I only noticed while I was about to leave and made a small turn to him. I didn’t say hi, or try to talk to him, I did worse… I scratched his back and left.

When I think about it, im cringing so hard and can’t even comprehend what spirits made me do that.  He didn’t even react and just turn around and stared at me (he is also very hard to read). 

I thought about not going to class anymore because I kinda feel that know he either obviously know that I have a crush on him or that I’m just utterly fully weird.

What should I do? Pretend like nothing happened ?

1keuphh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1keuphh/week_1_on_zepbound_observations_reflections/,Week 1 on Zepbound – Observations & Reflections,"Hi friends,

I’m one week into my Zep journey and just wanted to share a few reflections. I’ve been journaling every day, but something about putting it into the universe makes it more real than just keeping it all in a Google Doc.

I’ve been really touched by the kindness, vulnerability, and thoughtfulness in this community. When I shared something personal last week about weed and emotional regulation, I didn’t expect such an outpouring of kindness. It reminded me how powerful it is to have spaces that feel both safe and curious, so I wanted to give back a little. I may eventually share more about my background and what brought me here, but for now, I’m just reflecting out loud.

**Week 1 Wins & Lessons**

*The static got quiet.*  
For the first time in years, I felt what it was like to eat without panic, guilt, or rebellion—just space. I was able to listen to my hunger and fullness cues in real time, not after I’d already gone past them. That alone feels like a miracle.

*I don't have a food problem. I have a self-soothing one.*  
Weed has been my primary coping tool for a long time, especially at night. But I started to realize it was flattening everything—especially my ability to notice hunger or satiety. Most days, I’d go 20 hours without feeling hunger, then eat chaotically and in a panic during the two-hour window I was high. Zep didn’t erase my appetite, but it *did* create a pause long enough for me to see that clearly and start making different choices.

*Around Day 5–6, the noise shifted.*  
The emotional static crept back in. It wasn’t that it kept saying “I want to eat,"" but rather it was screaming “I need something, anything, to soothe me.” I started craving weed earlier than my self-imposed 8pm rule. I felt that internal hum of “what now?” -- which very much aligns with the part of me that fears stillness. I had to remind myself (and that part): “Even if it feels still, we are still moving.”

*Parts work saved me.*  
My therapist has been encouraging me to do parts work for a while, so this week I began talking to the activated parts of myself—Comfort-Craving CoffeeCat, Data-Driven CoffeCat, Spinning CoffeeCat. When things felt too jumbled, I visualized placing the chaos down, like a tangled ball of string. I told her she didn’t need to carry all of it at once. She exhaled. I did too.

*Data-backed intuition is my sweet spot.*  
I’ve been tracking protein, fiber, and total calories—not for restriction, but for curiosity. I noticed my cravings actually *mean* something: carrots when I want hydration and crunch, soup when I’m sick, protein when I’m depleted. I don’t always finish my plate. Sometimes I eat the burger *later* instead of right away. That’s new. That’s trust.

*Movement is joy, not punishment.*  
This week I continued the movement structures I've been building for the past year: a mix of yoga, strength classes, treadmill intervals, and a whole lot of walking, and I loved it. It wasn’t to undo what I ate. It was to be present in my body. (And I gotta say, I had some incredible poops). Movement and digestion were both in a great flow for me this week.

*A vision for weekends.*  
I learned that weekends (which are days 5-7 for me) can be gentle deficits or maintenance. I don’t need to force lower intake on social days, and I can eat more naturally after high-output workouts. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing.

*The subreddit makes a difference.*  
I’ve read thoughtful, honest reflections here. I’ve learned from others, laughed at a few posts, and felt held by the collective wisdom of strangers. There’s so much noise on the internet—thank you all for making this space one that helps people heal.

**Where I’m Headed**  
Zep didn’t make me someone else. It helped me hear *myself* again. There’s a quiet little room in my brain I didn’t know existed—one where I can pause, ask what I actually need, and listen before reacting. And even as the levels taper by the end of the week, I’m practicing how to get back to that room.

**What I’m Focusing on in Week 2**

* Letting the “spinning” parts of me pause without fear—building comfort with stillness.
* Sticking to my weed guardrails and exploring *why* the craving is there before reacting.
* Repeating meals that help me feel fueled, not just fed.
* Prioritizing protein, fiber, and hydration without overcomplicating it.
* Reaffirming that social days and movement-heavy days can support maintenance, not derail progress.
* Watching emotional hunger cues with curiosity instead of judgment.
* Continuing to check in with my body before, during, and after meals—not just when they’re done.

Week 2 is underway as of today. I don’t know what it’ll bring, but I’m still here, still listening, still building a new kind of trust with myself. And I'm so grateful for this sub. Thanks so much for reading, I appreciate you all!

1keuopm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1keuopm/hm_the_modern_alchemist/,[HM] The Modern Alchemist,"Harold Robinson sat in *The Beacher Café* with his pen in one hand and his cup of coffee in the other. He pressed the bitter potion up to his lips and took his first deep slurp of the day. A cup of Joe. Caffeine. Harold knew that the psychoactive drug was an integral part of the ritual which was about to occur. A transmutation from paper. He would inscribe runes into his notebook, and they would become transcendental. A fedora-adorned world of leggy dames would rise up before him and then a transmutation would occur in airport giftshops around the world. Paper into gold. He liked his coffee like his coffee would make him. Rich.

When Harold wrote, he wrote with his eyes closed, so that he might better see this other world he was channeling. Once complete, he would send off his notebook to a team of editors who would spend a week forensically analyzing the work, identifying his intentions from the overlapping scribbles. Every now and then he would check to make sure that he was not writing on the table. He took a sip from his second cup of the day and peeked an eye at his notebook. He saw that he had written *Zepplin Rulez* in a lightning font and drawn a picture of a duck who was using his corkscrew penis to open a bottle of wine.

Harold sighed. He turned the page. He closed his eyes. He breathed deeply in. He breathed deeply out. He repeated his mantra. He slurped his coffee. He searched his body for his emotions. He examined how his heart beat. He examined how his scalp tensed. He examined how his bowels rumbled. He breathed deeply in. He breathed deeply out. He was ready.

The caffeine had by now been digested into Harold’s stomach. It had entered his blood, and travelled into his brain, where it brewed, percolating the contents of his unconscious mind. His mind flowed down his spine into his fingers, into his pen, where it came out as the black ink which would transmogrify the paper before him into his dark, mysterious universe.

The pen glided across the page without ever coming up for air. Harold would never be able to accurately describe this reverie, but he had once told Oprah that it was like the reverse of a dream. In dreams, the conscious self enters into the realm of the unconscious, and the conscious self is able to explore. With a pen in his hand and coffee in his blood, the unconscious realm enters the conscious self and pushes outward. He enters a reality outside of time. It was at once a state of extreme lucidity and yet of total and immediate amnesia.

“Would you like some more coffee?”

Harold opened an eye. A woman stood over him with a pot full of coffee in her hand. He smiled and pushed the cup towards her. He looked down at the page and attempted to read what he had written but found it inscrutable. He thought that he could identify the word *casket* and the name of the protagonist of his series, Detective Dick Hardy. He hoped that the casket belonged to some no-good dame, rather than Dick.

Harold sipped a slurp of coffee. He closed his eyes. He breathed deeply in. He breathed deeply out. He repeated his mantra. He was ready. He turned the page –

The paper sliced through his pointer finger. The cut ran deep. The black of his visual field was replaced by a deep crimson. The stinging went on for an eternity. He had bought this notebook from a used bookstore because it had a picture of a private detective on the front. He had thought it an inconsequential decision at the time, yet nevertheless it was the one that had led him here. To this agony. The stinging swelled across his mind. The paper sliced through his skin. Through his veins. Through his bone. It had sliced with such precision that it had sliced clean through his atoms. 

The universe is composed of atoms, and all atoms are composed of energy. When an atom is split, that energy is released into the world in the form of an explosion. The same fundamental force which holds matter together is the force which most destructively tears it apart.

The nuclear blast travelled outwards in all direction from *The Beacher Café* into the greater solar system. All matter which stood in the way of the blast was torn apart, and as the explosion spread, it was clear that all matter did, in fact, stand in the way. Space contains uncountable stars, uncountable planets, uncountable alien lifeforms. All of which were shred by fire. Had history continued to exist, that day in the café, the day Harold sat down to write the fourth installment of his best-selling series, *Arson is a Naughty Crime*, would have gone down as the most tragic day in history. Harold had ended the universe that day.

But nothing ever truly ends.

The papercut which had opened the universe was so sharp that it tore through the higher-dimensional force which was slowly pulling the universe apart. This force was causing the infinite expansion of the universe that, given enough time, would have eventually resulted in the heat-death of the universe. Without this force counteracting gravity, the burned-out remains of the universe began to pull itself closer and closer together.

And so, after millions of eons, all of the energy of the universe had balled itself up into a state of universal oneness. A state of infinite potential. A cosmic egg which would hatch into a new universe. And just like the universe which Harold had inhabited; the new one began with a Bang. Matter sprang out into the -

Mostly because I really love the look of Roman collars and I feel as though my consciousness is better suited for ministry than it is family. (Sorry this is gonna be a rant)

I'm also only 19 so I cannot be taken seriously.

I tried to go to college last year. Failed all my exams. That was probably the best thing that happened to me cause it led me back to active Catholic lifestyle. I got reconciled and observed regular mass attendance again. I'm trying again this year. I might fail again, who knows? Maybe STEM really wasn't meant for me but I do hope to continue with college this year.

But amidst all this I've felt a growing disinterest in intimacy and emotional human connection. All my friends have ""left"" me behind and I've never meant it more when I say ""Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you.""

I think certain experiences in the past with friends and family have slowly carved away at my passion for worldly living.

I used to be a ""boy."" I used to wish for a cute gf and hugs and kisses. I used to watch movies and have lots of energy for going out on walks and coffee hangouts. I used to be in love with the world, but lately I've felt tired with everything---disillusioned. This world is not my home. I only want to come home to God. That's my real home.

I don't think I can stand having to court a lady and marry her and love her and go out on walks in the park and malls and be alive for her. I don't think I can stand binge watching Netflix with another human being. My mind's always ""Oh, I would really just like to sleep now"" or ""I really just wanna talk to Jesus right now.""

In 2019, I loved New Wave. In 2025, I can't stand music that isn't Christian folk or ballad. I just feel so ""nasisilawan"" by everything. That word means... to be blinded by a bright light. It's overstimulating.

Sometimes I think I just wanna preach to a congregation and facilitate the sacraments for the faithful. I want a quiet existence. I already preach to my father. It's like a night time Bible reading we do. I lead the rosary once a month and I write a lot. A lot. I write all sorts of stuff. I like writing. Maybe writing homilies will be no different. I think I have a passion for running my mouth.

I know being a priest is hard too. I watch Fr. David Michael Moses on Youtube and I've seen some of what it's about. By no means do I see this as a way to escape hardship. Rather, I think it's a path that will liberate me from the pull of worldly influences. I wouldn't have to wake up to the sound of blaring sports commentary anymore. I'll be surrounded by chill people and have all the silence I need for prayer.

I feel like I've been alive for 19 years and sustained some wounds to my heart and I don't feel like I have what it takes to ""live"" for human beings anymore. I don't think I can bear placing my life on a lover or a child anymore. I've fallen out of love. I do think I can ""die"" for Jesus. I think it is true that sadness is better than laughter. Honest sadness is better than deceitful laughter.

Maybe I should just go to seminary and see where it goes from there. If only I could at all get the darn scholarship I've been pursuing.

If though I am to pursue priesthood, then my family bloodline literally ends. No more folks with my surname on this island. My father and I are the last surviving members of our family. I die without kids, that's it.

In a way, it's like a fitting end. A family that ends with a priest in a time when the world, as I have come to understand it, is running low on priests.

-------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Understanding Smoothie Availability at Dairy Queen

If you're craving a refreshing smoothie and wondering whether Dairy Queen offers this popular treat, it's important to explore what their menu truly includes. Dairy Queen, widely celebrated for its ice cream treats and fast-food selections, surprisingly does not have traditional fruit smoothies listed on their standard menu. This might come as a disappointment if you're specifically looking for a classic smoothie made from blended fruits and yogurt or juice.

However, Dairy Queen's menu boasts a variety of frozen beverages that offer similar creamy and fruity qualities. These items are often mistaken for smoothies due to their thick, sweet consistency and fruit flavors. So, while Dairy Queen doesn't serve smoothies in the conventional sense, they provide interesting alternatives that deliver a comparable experience.

### Exploring Dairy Queen's Frozen Beverage Options

Dairy Queen's signature frozen beverages can be grouped into a few categories that resemble smoothies in texture and taste:

- **Fruit Smoothie Blasts** (Select locations only) – Some locations offer fruit smoothie blasts, which combine fruit flavors with a vanilla soft serve base. These creations mimic the creamy texture of smooth traditional smoothies but lean heavily on soft serve ice cream as a base rather than pure fruit blends.
- **Blizzard Treats** – The Blizzard is Dairy Queen’s most iconic frozen dessert. Though more of a thick ice cream shake than a smoothie, many Blizzard flavors feature fruit mix-ins such as strawberries, blueberries, or bananas. These can offer a fruity taste but contain less of the natural fruit blend found in typical smoothies.
- **Fruit Design Dilly Bars and Sundaes** – While these aren’t beverages, they often feature fruit toppings and flavors that invoke the freshness of fruit smoothies.
 
### Popular Smoothie-Like Alternatives to Try at Dairy Queen

If you’re visiting Dairy Queen and want to enjoy something close to a smoothie, these menu items might satisfy your craving:

- **Strawberry or Banana Fruit Smoothie Blast**: Depending on the availability, this is the closest item to a traditional smoothie. It mixes fruit syrup or puree with soft serve, giving a creamy but fruity taste.
- **Frosted Lemonade or Strawberry Lemonade**: While not smoothies, these frozen lemonade drinks provide a cool, fruity beverage alternative that can be refreshing on a hot day.
- **Blizzard with Fruit Mix-Ins**: Ordering a Blizzard with fruit flavors such as cherry, strawberry, or banana chunks will offer a thick, fruity treat, though it’s more dessert-like than a healthy smoothie.
 
### Why Dairy Queen Does Not Feature Traditional Smoothies

Dairy Queen primarily focuses on soft serve ice cream and frozen desserts rather than health-driven beverage options like smoothies. Their brand identity aligns more with sweet, indulgent treats than low-calorie or fruit-centric drinks. Because traditional smoothies usually emphasize fresh fruits and sometimes yogurt or milk alternatives, Dairy Queen’s menu opts for frozen mixes with ice cream bases to appeal to their core audience’s cravings.

Moreover, the preparation of traditional smoothies requires different equipment and ingredients that may not fit the fast-paced service model of Dairy Queen. This contributes to the limited smoothie-style options, which cater more to dessert lovers seeking rich, sweet treats rather than healthy fruit beverages.

### Other Menu Options With Fruit Flavors

Even though classic smoothies are missing, you can indulge in some menu items that highlight fruit flavors beautifully:

- **Fruit-Flavored Blizzards**: Such as Cherry or Strawberry Cheesecake Blizzards, combining savory and sweet fruit flavors packed with soft serve swirl.
- **Fruit Toppings on Sundaes and Cones**: You can customize your vanilla soft-serve with fruit syrups and fresh or frozen fruit toppings.
- **Frozen Beverages like Lemonades**: These include strawberry or frozen limeade varieties that offer a refreshing taste without the creamy texture.
 
### Tips for Finding Smoothie Alternatives in Fast Food Chains

If smoothies are your preferred style of refreshing, fruity drinks, you might want to consider other fast food or café chains that specialize in fresh fruit and yogurt blends. However, if you prefer stopping at Dairy Queen, knowing how to navigate their menu can help you enjoy a satisfying frozen treat without expecting a classic smoothie.

When ordering, ask your server if any local Dairy Queen locations feature Fruit Smoothie Blasts or seasonal fruit-flavored frozen drinks. Sometimes limited-time offers or regional menus introduce new smoothie-like beverages that can offer a fresher, fruitier option.

Ultimately, while Dairy Queen does not have traditional smoothies, their alternative frozen treats do provide variety, combining fruit flavors with creamy textures for an enjoyable experience that balances indulgence and refreshment.

</div>Best Alternatives at Dairy Queen for a Refreshing Treat Beyond Smoothies
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Refreshing Treat Choices at Dairy Queen Beyond Smoothies

If you’re a fan of Dairy Queen but find that smoothies aren’t always on the menu or you want to mix things up with something different, you’re in luck. Dairy Queen offers a variety of cool, delightful treats that can satisfy your craving for a refreshing beverage or dessert. Whether you’re craving something fruity, creamy, or icy-cold, these alternatives provide plenty of options to cool off and indulge in a sweet moment.

### Frozen Beverages That Ignite Your Senses

Even though Dairy Queen does not feature traditional smoothies on its menu, the chain shines when it comes to frozen beverages. Here are some exciting choices that can quench your thirst with a flavorful twist:

- **Blizzard Treats:** These are Dairy Queen’s iconic frozen delights, blending soft-serve ice cream with a variety of mix-ins like cookies, candies, and fruit bits. While not a beverage, their creamy texture makes them a perfect choice for a cool, satisfying treat on a hot day.
- **Frosted Beverages:** Dairy Queen offers Frosted Lemonades and Frosted Coffees, which are a mix of their signature soft serve with lemonade or coffee. These options provide a refreshing alternative that combines tangy or caffeinated notes with creamy smoothness.
- **Freezes:** A popular choice at DQ, Freezes are slushy treats that come in various fruity flavors. These are icy, hydrating, and low-calorie compared to other dessert options and come in favorites like cherry or blue raspberry.

### Soft Serve Options for a Creamy Refresh

If you’re leaning toward something rich but perfectly cool, Dairy Queen’s classic soft serve dishes stand out:

- **Vanilla or Chocolate Soft Serve:** Order a classic cone or cup of vanilla or chocolate soft serve for a simple yet satisfying treat.
- **Dipped Cones:** The chocolate or cherry dip adds a crunchy shell over the soft serve that’s both fun and refreshing.
- **Sundaes:** Topped with hot fudge, caramel, nuts, or strawberries, the sundaes offer a combination of textures and flavors that delight the palate.

### Fruit-Infused Choices for a Natural Boost

While Dairy Queen is famous for its creamy desserts, the menu also includes options that bring in fruit freshness without blending into a smoothie form:

- **Frozen Lemonade:** Tart and revitalizing, this icy drink is perfect for those who prefer something light and citrusy.
- **Vanilla Cone with Fruit Freshness:** Combine a simple vanilla ice cream cone with a side of fresh strawberries, sometimes available seasonally, for a naturally sweet alternative.

### Customizing Your Dairy Queen Experience

Another way to enjoy refreshing treats without ordering a smoothie is to mix and match menu items based on your preference. For example, you could order a small Freeze and pair it with a soft serve cone for a layered flavor and texture experience. Many locations are happy to customize orders to suit your taste, such as adding extra fruit toppings or adjusting sweetness.

Dairy Queen’s versatility shines when you explore the possibilities, allowing you to enjoy cold, fruity, creamy, or icy treats just the way you want them. Just ask the staff about any special options or seasonal offerings that can serve as exciting alternatives to smoothies.

### Where to Find These Refreshing Options

Most Dairy Queen restaurants carry these delicious frozen treats year-round, but availability can vary based on location and season. You’ll find the Blizzard Treats, Frozen Lemonade, and Freezes on the core menu, while sundaes and cones are staples no matter the time of year. For the most accurate menu options, check the Dairy Queen website or app before visiting so you know exactly what refreshing, smoothie-free alternatives await you.

### Why Choose Dairy Queen for a Refreshing Treat?

Dairy Queen’s menu excels at turning simple ingredients into classic comfort treats loved by many. The brand’s focus on soft serve ice cream and creative mix-ins offers an array of choices that provide a sensory delight without the need for smoothies. These options are especially great if you want a tactile, flavorful experience—whether it’s the smoothness of ice cream or the icy relief of a fruit-flavored Freeze.

Ultimately, Dairy Queen provides smart alternatives that can keep you cool and refreshed on a sunny afternoon or after a busy day. By selecting one of these popular treats, you get a perfect balance of sweetness, chill, and texture—no blender necessary.

### Conclusion

If you’ve been wondering, ""Does Dairy Queen have smoothies?"" the straightforward answer is no. Dairy Queen does not currently offer traditional fruit smoothies on their menu. However, that doesn’t mean you have to miss out on a cold, sweet, and refreshing treat when visiting. Their menu offers plenty of delicious alternatives that deliver a similar satisfying experience.

For a creamy, fruity option, you can explore Dairy Queen’s Blizzard treats, which blend soft-serve ice cream with fruity candies or toppings. These offer a rich and indulgent option if you’re craving something sweet and fruity. Another great choice is their frozen lemonades or berry smoothie-inspired drinks like the Strawberry Banana smoothie—available at some locations—which offer a refreshing, fruity beverage with a Dairy Queen twist.

Beyond these, Dairy Queen’s classic DQ soft-serve, shakes, and fruit-based beverages provide diverse ways to cool down without missing out on flavor or texture. Whether you prefer something rich and creamy or light and fruity, Dairy Queen’s variety ensures there is a treat that can fit the bill.

So, while Dairy Queen may not serve traditional smoothies, their menu alternatives bring you close to that cold and fruity experience. Next time you visit, consider trying one of these options—you just might find a new favorite that perfectly satisfies your craving for a refreshing, sweet treat.

This is going to be extremely long and I’m already so sorry but no one that doesn’t want to, has to read it.
I am drowning in heartbreak and overthinking. I feel confused and discarded.

The past 7 months I had been talking to someone that was stationed overseas. I started liking him more and more because it was so much fun gaming with him, he was witty and sweet. Whenever we talked on the phone, which was not often, it was for hours. 
Although he would take hours to text back and sometimes overthinking got to me that maybe I was hoping for more than this could ever be but then he actually booked tickets to come see me.

It was not easy. It was stressful and tickets were expensive. He was in between moving to the base he was going to be stationed next. And he still came. He got me snacks from the countries he had visited while being deployed where he was. I never expected him to even think of getting me something from his travels. 

Once he got here, it was kind of rocky. Surely we’re from different cultures and that was our first time meeting each other in real life so I was very nervous. 10 days was the time we had. Or should’ve had. Towards the end it got better and better. We were laughing, gaming together, exploring the city, going places. 

We were flirting throughout the months and making jokes about marriage and kids and whatever. But he seemed reserved. At one point we were joking about getting married and having kids, being flirty but he was so reserved and I didn’t understand if he was just teasing me or not so I said something along the lines of me feeling like anytime I try to make a move he puts me right back into friendzone. He replied by saying I put myself in friendzone by being the way that I am. I thought he was joking but he said he was being serious. When I asked why he didn’t say anything earlier and why he was flirting and joking along with me he said he didn’t want things to get awkward since he was gonna be with me for the rest of his trip. That took me a back and actually hurt me. We still went out and had drinks. It was awkward and I couldn’t bare the overthinking so I eventually got drunk. 

Once we got home we had a little argument about earlier and I cried. I felt like a complete fool and thought he was only here for a vacation and not actually because of me. Which he said was not true. He said he was going to look for a hotel in the morning. I didn’t want him to leave. He stayed. We made up. So far so good. I tried being as good of a host as I could be. Tried to not make it awkward and I was embarrassed about crying the night before.

During breakfast we talked about the night before and he told me he is here because of me and called it dating. But he said every relationship starts off with being friends first and then eventually you start dating and he wanted to see where this would go. He was interested and did like me. I decided to stop being annoying about my overthinking. 

The following days were better. We had lots of fun and even started an insider joke. We laughed a lot. I fell for him. His smile, his voice, his dimples and overall the way he speaks, he is smart and funny. I felt like he liked me too but there was a tiny voice telling me he is going to block me once he gets back home and gets to his next base. He said he wouldn’t and that he’s gonna miss me too. We had even talked about him coming back to see me again.

He has two phone numbers. One from where he was deployed last and one from his home country. When the date of him being deployed somewhere else was getting closer I started asking about his phone number from home because how were we gonna stay in touch because he obviously is not gonna keep a phone number from a country he’s not living in anymore. He eventually gave it to me, that was before he got here.

One night we were at a bar and that was brought up I don’t remember who did but we were talking about it and he said he only gave me his phone number from home because I demanded it. I felt stupid. I said I didn’t demand it and he didn’t have to give it to me if he didn’t want to. I offered to delete it if he wanted me to and did so when he told me to delete it. 
He then said he was just messing with me and trying to see if I was bluffing. He said he doesn’t even use it. He is gonna get a new one at his next base anyways.
I felt weird. I was confused and the tiny voice saying he is gonna block me and go no contact once he gets back home got louder. I tried to ignore it. 

We had lots of fun the last few days and then had an argument one night. I asked him why he would lie about not having friends when that’s not true and why he would lie about not talking to other girls. I wouldn’t mind but I don’t appreciate being lied to and also just didn’t understand why it was necessary to lie about that at all. He got nervous, said he that that’s not true and then suddenly it was true but it was friends he has had for years, he doesn’t even remember the name of one of the girls and she is more annoying than anything else because he doesn’t even reply and she still sends memes. I didn’t believe any of it. I was so disappointed and sad. I felt like all the overthinking that he was only here for a trip and didn’t care about me at all was true. 

He started looking for an Airbnb. I didn’t try to make him stay because I didn’t feel like he was here because of me and hoped that he would say something himself and not me making a move again. I wanted to see if he genuinely wants this. I did tell him that I’m not kicking him out and he can stay here but I didn’t want to have to convince him. He didn’t say anything. He then found a place to stay but stayed the night at my place because he could only check in at noon time the following day. I didn’t want him to leave. I offered that he could still stay. He could stay here with me and spend the last 2 days as he wanted. I was so anxious and so hurt. I kept replaying everything he said and the past 7 months of us talking. I felt so stupid. I knew I was in for a heartbreak at this point.

Following morning. Both of us had barely slept. I made him breakfast, we had coffee. No one said anything. Even if I tried talking to him there seemed to be no point. He was ignoring me while waiting to be able to leave and go his Airbnb. I asked why he was ignoring me and being rude when I’m not doing that to him. 

I told him to go ahead and block me now instead of later on as he was going to do that anyways. And I told him to take the snacks he had brought me because I didn’t want them anymore. Because I was so angry and hurt. I was so sad and anxious. I didn’t mean it. And I regret that so much. I don’t ever do or say things like that no matter what emotions I’m going through. But at that point my emotions unfortunately got the best of me and took over. 

His response was “stop bothering me”. He got up and left. Said “thanks” on his way out and when I asked if he was seriously gonna leave just like that he said “yep” and left. Didn’t even look at me.

I closed the door and had to sit down to process what just happened followed by immediately crying.
He since has blocked me everywhere but WhatsApp and the phone number from his home country. I don’t know why. Maybe he only deleted the App and that’s why his account is still there and I’m not blocked on there? Maybe he changed phone numbers and that’s why I’m not blocked on the other one from his home country? I don’t know. 

I tried calling him and texted him because I was worried about him in a foreign country all by himself. Never got a response. Obviously.

I feel discarded, I feel played and I feel stupid. I’m hurting over this and I wish I could rewind time. I keep asking myself why did I even bring that up? I didn’t want to argue at all. I was calm and told him that I’m not trying to argue, I’m not doing anything. I just didn’t appreciate being lied to because of all the other signals he had been giving me that made me feel like I was just a vacation host and tour guide. I should’ve just stopped talking. 

But then why would he pay so much for tickets and take on so more than 10 hours of travelling just to see me? Why would he think of me when travelling and then bring me something from his travels? Why was he being so sweet? Why did he open up about his past and family life etc.? Did he ever like me? Did he ever care at all? 

I don’t even know why I’m doing this. I feel so lost and confused. It hurts. I feel like I imagined all of this. None of it was ever real. It was all just in my head. I’m such a fool. I keep rewatching his videos, him playing guitar, his vlogs he made for me during his travels although I am now not so sure he made them for me. I had asked him to do vlogs for me because I loved listening to him. I keep looking at his pictures. I miss him so much. It’s gonna take so long to get over this and it makes me to not want to even meet anyone else again.
I feel so crazy and like such a fool. I haven’t felt like that in years. He was the first person I fell for after being single for 3 years now. 

I’ve been trying to keep myself occupied. I got back into reading. I go to the gym more than I did before. I even got myself a guitar and started practicing. Still can’t get him out of my head. 

I don’t even expect anyone to read all this but it does feel good to get this off my chest cause I don’t want to talk to anyone about this. 

TL;DR: talked to someone for 7 months that was deployed overseas. He flew out to see me. Things started rocky but got better. Had lots of fun, even an insider, I fell for him. Ended with an argument 3 days before the end of his trip. He left earlier and blocked me everywhere. Now I’m drowning in heartbreak.",6,1746393000.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.88,False

1keug4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Widow/comments/1keug4j/i_feel_like_i_killed_him/,I feel like I killed him,"My husband died by suicide in early December and I have been absolutely shattered. We have been together for 20+ years and married for almost 16 years. We have a 7 year old son together. I feel like I’m stuck between two planes right now… wanting to join him in the afterlife and needing to be on earth for our son. I have so much guilt that I had NO CLUE that he was suicidal (nobody did) and I feel like, as his partner and adult in his life, I failed to keep him here with us. 

The worst part is that, a week before he died, I brought up some things about our relationship that I thought we could continue to work on. I didn’t want to talk about it at first, but my husband said he wanted to know what I was thinking, and I told him I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. He insisted that it was ok to talk and I told him that I was so so very happy with our marriage but that I wanted to know that he would always be there for me emotionally in the future. 

We had many years where he put his career before me. There were years where he wouldn’t eat any meals with me or our son, wouldn’t stop working from his home office to have a 5 minute cup of coffee with me, wouldn’t take lunch breaks, would barely acknowledge that I lived in the house, would have sex but not sleep in the same bed as me at night. 

My husband finally got a new job in a new career, and the past 2 years have been so great, but even recently, when he was home, he often seemed to want to do projects or hobbies that took a ton of time. Like running on a treadmill for 6 hours in the basement, making pies for work for 12 hours on a Sunday, doing yard work all day, etc. 

I was going to EMDR therapy to help with some childhood stuff. But going through the EMDR made me realize that I still didn’t always feel an “emotional connection” from my husband. My therapist suggested I talk to him and so I did. I asked that he try to listen to the emotion or feelings that I had when I was talking with him and asked if he could be more emotionally available to me in return. I stressed how much I loved him and how much these past two years have meant to me and just asked that he never “leave” me emotionally again. 

Fast forward about a week and he started crying and said he wasn’t ok. He said he thought he was “broken” inside and couldn’t feel things like other people. He said there was a lot of things that he didn’t tell me about his childhood and his dad being abusive and leaving him when he was around 10. He NEVER talked to me about his dad except to say he “didn’t have one” or was an a-hole or something. So this was a lot of opening up on his part. My husband then held both my hands and said “but don’t worry, I made an appointment with an online therapist and I’m ready to talk now. I want to be the best dad and husband for us.” I told him I would sit with him during the appointment if he’d like. I was so proud that he made a counseling appointment on his own. 

We never got there. Two days later (and two before his appointment), he came home from work and said he would come to our son’s art class with me. Usually only one of us goes since there is no seating and we just have to sit in the car in the parking lot. He looked so exhausted so I told him to stay home and relax. Plus it was cold and snowing and I thought he could just be comfortable until we got home. I said I’d make avocado toast for dinner.

When my son and I got home, there was a note on the hallway wall that said don’t go down stairs. I thought he had decided to surprise me with dinner in our finished basement because he is sweet like that. But then it turned into a note that said he now knew he was a narcissist and my son and I were better without him and that he loved us so much.

Never in a million years would I have thought that he would have ended his life. He had just told me how happy he was being with my son and me and how much he enjoyed our life together. He finally had a job and career that made him feel valued and said that he enjoyed it. We just got a new puppy at his request and booked a vacation the night before. He was an awesome dad and so close to our son.

Everyday that passes I miss him more and more. And I just keep blaming myself for talking to him about our relationship. It was meant to move us forward and make us stronger, but I feel like I killed him. Please help me. I’m so grief stricken and don’t want to be here without him.

Just as an fyi, I am seeing a new therapist that specializes in suicide grief and my son is now in therapy too. But the pain is still so great. It’s overwhelming. ",4,1746392802.0,Widow,0,1.0,False

Note, I have a solid job (teacher with 20 year long list of good results and happy parents and students of all ages), own most of my London house outright own car (decent Audi A1) fully paid off and I dont drink or do drugs. I'm a good man... even my ex would say so (and does(! My GF and I have..../ are??... very much in love with each other, her kids really like me and miss me when im gone. The Father and ex has a really good job and owns 80% of the house, the car etc and really has a hold over my Girlfriends world, stability and mind, She is really trying to break free from the ex and buy him out of the house. She has been trying to organise mediation but he keeps dragging his heels. The situation is a shit storm. A guy at work asked her out and now he is mean to her because of the rejection so she is getting smashed from every angle. On Wednesday she had to take the morning after pill after we got a bit carried away, I noticed by Thursday eve she wasn't responding to goodnight txts but knew she was exhausted so just didnt give it much thought, we met up on Friday and things were a bit off, awkward embrace arriving and leaving and she was snappy at me. That eve she found a letter about a parking ticket she had failed to pay and it had been escalated from £60 to £195. She messaged me freaking out and I said I'd pay it, as it wasnt her mistake (as she thought) I had failed to put the correct date on the ticket. I owned up straight away. I said I'd pay it 4 times  she said no, it went back and forth and she insisted that she would let her ex pay for it.  I wished her goodnight and again nothing. After a couple hours ruminating I sent her a msg asking if she was ok? I then got a barrage of texts from her saying i was a scammer, I had made her get the ticket on purpose, that she didnt like the fact that I had said ok to her letting her ex pay for the ticket as it was like taking money away from her kids. She then removed her whatsapp pic and set her profile to not register if she was on line or if she had read messages but we could still send msgs to each other. She sent a few more messages saying that she feels she has rushed things and that she shouldnt have invited me into her life with her kids (something she had been very open and happy about me being part of their lives previously).  She said she is worried she isnt ready for a relationship and like her ex says ""she rushes into things"". I'm massively shell shocked by the whole thing and feel very emotionally broken and distraught. I was up all night but paid the ticket myself and emailed her the receipt. I asked her to take some time to think about the situation rationally and that I am here for her if she needs. I suggested we meet up for a chat  / walk / coffee once she has had time to collect her thoughts and to let me know if and when she was ready to do that. The next day I read  a bunch of stuff on reddit about some of the side effects of the morning after pill and that It can give people anxiety and paranoia and 20 or so stories of women feeling numb and out of love with their partner for 10 days or so while the pill took effect then going back to normal, I sent her the article and said this might be the reason she is feeling doubtful and confused and not to worry, but that I was (like I had said before) here for her in both the good and bad times whatever happens, for her to should stay strong even if she felt terrible. I'm so confused. Can someone offer me insight as to what i'm supposed to do. I feel incredibly battered. I have had 4 hours sleep in 48 hours and feel like i'm in shock, I'm exhausted but still cant sleep, I've gone for walks with the dog, eaten well, meditated etc but still cant pass out. I feel like I'm losing the love of my life. (i've had many long term relationships) but even in the short time we have been together this is the strongest love I've ever felt, she has said the same about me and thanked me for choosing her and her kids.",8,1746392414.0,relationship_advice,24,0.75,False

We were together a very short time but I fell hard and fast for him, he was just such an incredible guy. Three months in he dumped me in a very respectful manner. He didn’t feel like he was a good boyfriend, was so busy and he felt guilty, didn’t feel the same way about me anymore, told me it wasn’t my fault and he didn’t want me to change anything about myself, yada yada. 

We stayed friends-ish but didn’t hang out or talk or anything. We basically just kept up a snap streak until a few months later when he got into a car accident and I(drunkenly) panicked over it. We stopped keeping up contact after that except just quick “happy birthday!” messages in August and September+him reaching out once to let me know he saw my dad on TV(he loves my dad). That was in November of 2024. Overall, from April 2024 to April 2025 we barely spoke. 

At the beginning of April this year however, I got a snap from him. I half expected it to be something about my dad again but instead he was wanting to catch up. So we did that and basically just gave some updates on ourselves and our families. I ended up telling him I’d recently started going to church again(we’re both religious), and it turns out we were both lacking anyone to go with. He offered to come with me and we’ve been attending church together on Sundays for about a month now, sometimes getting coffee after, and again keeping up a Snapstreak. 

I can’t figure out if he’s trying to get back together or actually trying to be my friend like he said he wanted to when we broke up. I’m ok with either, but not knowing what’s going on stresses me out. I’ve never really been great with social stuff and although I do have family and friends who are happy to lend their opinions I’d really love some unbiased ones! :)",0,1746392264.0,AskMenRelationships,3,0.5,False

Ever felt like you’re sprinting on a treadmill, just to stay in the same place? 🙈 We’re all trying to crush our goals, but let’s face it: sometimes, it’s like we’re stuck in hyperdrive, zooming forward but not really getting anywhere. 

What if I told you that sometimes, being a little ""lazy"" can actually turbocharge your productivity? Sounds counterintuitive, right? But hear me out! 

### The Power of Lazy Motivation 

1. **Break It Down**  
   Instead of tackling an entire project (hello, overwhelm!), **chunk it into bite-sized pieces**.  
   - Write 100 words instead of 1000.  
   - Spend just 10 minutes organizing that chaotic closet.  
   - Make one healthy meal instead of a full week’s prep.  
   
   These tiny wins might just spark some energy! ✨

2. **Create a Cozy Start**  
   Set the mood for productivity! Find your comfy spot, put on some chill tunes, and grab your favorite coffee (or maybe that extra slice of cake? No judgment!). The more enjoyable the environment, the easier it is to get moving!

3. **Use the Pomodoro Trick**  
   Ever tried working in bursts? **25 minutes of focused work**, followed by a 5-minute break. Rinse and repeat. This makes it feel less like “work” and more like a game. Plus, those lil' breaks? Perfect for sneaking in a few lazy moments of scrolling through Reddit! 

4. **Visualize the Victory**  
   Take a moment to **imagine yourself celebrating that goal**. What does it feel like? How do you reward yourself? Pumping yourself up about the endgame can help you wriggle your way out of procrastination!

5. **Ditch Perfectionism**  
   Perfectionism is such a joy-sucker! 😩 Instead of aiming for flawless, focus on “good enough.” It frees you from that mental hamster wheel. 

### Personal Story Time!  
A few months back, I was tasked with launching a side project. I felt like I was trying to climb Everest with no gear. After some serious self-talk (and a pizza binge), I decided to just commit to working **5 minutes** on it every day. Guess what? Those 5 minutes turned into hours, and I found my groove! Sometimes, **you just gotta trick your brain!**

So, what about you? Have you found a trick that fuels your motivation (even if it seems lazy)? Let’s share our “easy” hacks! You never know who might find their spark from your experience. 🌟",1,1746392135.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1keu5wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sextortion/comments/1keu5wc/a_month_and_a_half_retrospective/,"A month and a half, retrospective","Hi guys,

First of all, I’m really sorry for what you’ve been through. It’s been a month since I experienced this myself. I’m doing fine now—no lingering anxiety. I’m writing this post by pushing myself, because during my hardest moments, especially in the early days, this subreddit helped me so much. It gave me perspective on what was happening. I read people’s experiences. And it felt good to know I wasn’t alone. Now I want to give something back.

I won’t go into detail about my own experience. About 80% of it is similar to others. What I want to talk about more is our health, especially our mental health. Maybe we lost some money. Maybe we couldn’t sleep for a day or two. Maybe those scammers already forgot and deleted us. But we might still be carrying the fear of the incident.

What I want to say is, we went through something big, and it’s totally normal for our bodies to react. But if this state drags on, it becomes harder to get out of. We take more damage than necessary. The scammers forget about you and me and move on to new targets, but we waste our own seconds, minutes, hours, months, even years over endless “what if” questions. But we can’t afford to lose even one more second to these miserable people.

Before sharing my personal thoughts, here’s what I think we must do:

1. Cut off all communication with the scammer. Block them everywhere.


2. Do not go through this alone. Tell your family—ideally every member (mother, father, siblings). If your environment doesn’t allow for that, at least tell a trustworthy friend. But if your family situation is safe, absolutely tell them. Get family or friend support. Don’t isolate yourself.


3. Save all the records you have and report the crime to local police, court, or any legal resources you have access to. Provide your records when needed. Get the justice system on your side, because what these people did is a CRIME.


4. Again—cut all communication with the scammer. I’m repeating this because it’s the only way to break free. There are many posts in this subreddit explaining how this scam works. When things are fresh, it’s hard to understand the logic. But after 1–2 weeks, when things calm down, you begin to see how irrational it is for them to keep chasing you—as long as you’ve stopped talking or paying.



Because the more you block them, the more they have to try new numbers to reach you. Every new number costs money and time. It also increases their chance of getting caught. So chasing you becomes loss, while finding new victims is profit.

As for the threat of leaks—if they leak something, they’ve completed the crime. What they want first is money. You see all this much more clearly once things settle down.


---

Now, let’s ask: Why did we fall for this? Was it a tragic event?

Someone in my family gave me this example: What if that “girl” invited you somewhere? You knew nothing about her, and on your very first meeting, she asked you to come to her home. You go. Then some “man” shows up and says, “What are you doing with my wife?” Then demands money.

This story could change—the start, the middle, the end. But let me ask you—wouldn’t we fall for this too?

In our own case, we ignored things that were right in front of us. We made obvious mistakes. That means something in our lives was already wrong, we had a weak spot, and we were hit right there.

And as that example shows—it could’ve been worse. That’s why I choose to see this not as a tragedy, but as something I need to learn from. I now understand that I need to be patient, that real relationships—or even just casual ones—can’t be built through shady places like this online. Personally, I’m also stepping away from porn (just my own decision—treat this part as optional).

What I’m saying is: The earlier you accept this as a lesson, the faster you’ll return to normal—or better yet, become a stronger version of yourself.

Most likely, you couldn’t sleep the night it happened. I couldn’t either. I was awake for 48 hours—fear, anxiety, uncertainty.

In a situation like this, after doing the things I listed above, we need to focus directly on our health. And for that, we need proper sleep.

Spend the next month—or at least a few weeks—giving sleep the priority it deserves. This incident ruined our sleep and turned us into ghosts. Let’s stop the damage and use sleep to return to ourselves.

Live in a way that allows you to get enough sleep. Go to bed early. Don’t do things in the evening that wake you up. Drink coffee earlier in the day. Don’t watch stressful shows. Don’t play games. Put sleep first. Sleep 8 hours. At least for a while, adjust your life to this rhythm, because what we went through was mentally and emotionally exhausting.

A small note: I’m not trying to stress you out. Don’t pressure yourself by thinking, “I have to sleep, I need to sleep.” That can make sleeping even harder. Instead, say the opposite: “I shouldn’t sleep, or else…” I saw this trick online and it works for me.


---

You’ll experience ups and downs throughout the day. Our goal is to increase the frequency of the ups—and in those moments, remind yourself how the scam works. And when the downs come, try to get through them with calming activities, like breathing exercises, and try to minimize them.

Be aware of the moments when you feel calm, hopeful, and safe. In those moments, anchor the truth in your mind: these people don’t have anything personal against you. All they care about is money. Many of them don’t even have access to your friends list—they’re bluffing.

Or let’s say a friend of yours went through this, and somehow you saw his privates. So what? What are we going to do with photos? We'll just report the sender and if we are good friends we can make a joke little bit maybe but thats it. 


---

And friends, finally, I want to say:

I don’t know how they reached out to you.
I don’t know if you’re a man or a woman.
I don’t know how things unfolded for you.
I don’t know if you paid them.
I don’t know how angry you are at yourself.
I don’t know how ashamed you feel.
I don’t know if you told your family.
I don’t know if you filed a report.
I don’t know if your photos were leaked.
I don’t know if people in your social circle saw them.
I don’t know if anyone mocked you.

But please, friends, don’t punish yourself just because of these disgusting scammers.

Their lives are built on destruction. With the money they steal, they go and do more dirty things. Their filth spreads to others—to me, to you, to the elderly, children, young people, our goals, our health, our future. In short, to our lives, directly or indirectly.

And these people are still out there, wasting oxygen—if only that’s all they were wasting.

If they keep going full speed, and we give ourselves over to doubt and anxiety, then the worst-case scenario has already happened.

You have so much to offer this world. Don’t let this bad incident, or these parasites, take that away from you.

Take care.

I manage marine collagen tablets but cannot stand protein bars, chips etc. I finally found a protein drink that doesn't make me instantly nauseous (my protein clear whey bitter lemon) but I now can't get it anywhere- the company doesn't seem to want to respond to my enquiries if its gone for good. I just tried the vegan version and eugh!! I dont have the cash to splash on buying a load of different ones to try.
Anything can someone please recommend some not vile protein supplements to me? Something truly tasteless I could mix in my coffee or normal squash would be amazing.

1keu3x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1keu3x7/his_ig_following_is_a_dealbreaker_right/,"His IG following is a dealbreaker, right??","TLDR: Guy I’ve known for years comes back into my life when we’re both single and makes a move, but his IG following is lustful…bad idea, right?

I knew this guy back in college. Let’s call him Jim. Jim and I had mutual friends and became acquaintances. Jim and I had the same sense humor and could always make each other laugh. Similar hobbies and interests. I developed a crush on him, and I felt there was a mutual chemistry between us, but neither of us made a move. We were both too shy and awkward to venture into that territory. Regardless, he was always super friendly toward me as a friend-complimenting me in different ways, supporting me. Anyways, I fell into a relationship, and he moved away.

Over the years I’ve followed Jim’s life on Facebook. He’s had a couple relationships, but nothing that lasted. Through the years I’ve kept my positive view of him and often wondered what would have happened if one of us had made a move? Sometimes he felt like the one who got away. I always wondered what would happen if he moved back. We’re both single now. Would he pop up on Hinge? Would we have our chance?

A couple months ago, Jim posts that he’s moving back home. Last week, I get a DM, asking me how I’ve been. We get to chatting, and Jim asks me to grab a coffee with him. We meet up and he’s just as funny and charming as he was ten years ago. There’s intense chemistry between us. He asks if I want to meet up again in a few days, I say sure. We go out for drinks, it’s clear this is a date. He expresses how finding love wasn’t working out for him in his old location, and how he just wants to settle down and maybe have a kid. I played it cool, but I’m thinking how this is absolutely my goal right now too. 

Anyways, we’ve been texting, he’s been asking me when I’m free for dinner, and idk why I never thought to look before but I realize he’s probably on IG. It took a little searching and going through mutual friend accounts, as he doesn’t go by his full name on there, but I found his account last night. The posts are fine, great really. All the pics he’s been posting on FB over the years, along with some other pics of his day to day life. Then I clicked on his following tab to see who he follows. 

Jim follows a lot of accounts. 2k to be exact. At first, I wasn’t concerned. Lots of food/wellness/camping/movie/music pages. Lots of local businesses. Mutual friends. And then, I saw an account with a sexy female and “xxx” in the username. I click on the profile and this girl is clearly a OF girl. As I continue to scroll, I probably found at least 20-30 more blatant OF girl accounts. While those were the only OF girls pages, I noticed he follows a TON of fitness influencer girlies…also some girls I’d just put in the category of IG influencer “baddie”, posting pics for likes. The more I scrolled, the more I came to the realization that Jim just follows a ton of attractive girls *in general*. Not just the influencers, but local news people, store owners, hair stylists, realtors, etc.

I’m so torn up over this. His IG following bothers me, and from everything I’m reading on Reddit it sounds like a massive red flag. On one hand I feel like I discovered something I wasn’t meant to see, like was it even reasonable for me to look him up? Check out his following list? Am I a paranoid creep? On the other hand, to so blatantly and publicly like these accounts as a 30yr old man gives me the ick, like people can see the videos you like. I did click around a little bit to see if I could find comments and/or likes, and I couldn’t find any. That’s good at least that he’s not commenting all over the content? He’s been single for years now. Maybe it’s the single guy thing to like these sorts of accounts?

I don’t know. I don’t know what to say to him, nor do I know if it’s in my place to say anything to him. I mean I don’t follow him on IG, he doesn’t even know I know he has a profile, let alone I’ve checked the entire account for red flags. I’ve read people on Reddit say that it’s no use confronting a man on this, because it’s a clear indication of their character whether or not they “clean up” the profile and the guy isn’t going to change. I *know* not all men do this, and it breaks my heart that the guy I’ve been thinking about all these years is sleezy.

at goal now so just going to maintain with Omad & healthy foods. I was pretty much an alcoholic before this and my inflammation has really gone down so  i plan to not drink unless extremely special occasion like wedding/anniversaries.

1ketuq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeaWith10H/comments/1ketuq1/sign_me_up_cancer_edition/,Sign Me Up — Cancer Edition,"
**Welcome to *’Sign Me Up’* — the zodiac breakdown that reads like your diary, your mom’s deepest secrets, and your childhood trauma… lovingly seasoned with lunar mysticism and feral loyalty.**

Cancer is the zodiac’s moonchild — intuitive, protective, nurturing, and deeply, *deeply* emotionally suspicious. They feel everything, remember everything, and forgive… eventually. *Maybe.* After they’ve made a Pinterest board about it.

## ☀️ **Cancer at a Glance:**
- **Dates:** June 21 - July 22
- **Element:** Water
- **Ruling Planet:** The Moon (emotions, instincts, memories)
- **Modality:** Cardinal (initiating, leading, emotionally bossy)
- **Symbol:** The Crab (hard outside, soft gooey center)
- **Ruling House:** The 4th House (home, roots, ancestry, private life)

## ♋ **What it Means to Be a Cancer:**

Cancer is the *fourth* sign of the zodiac, the origin story of emotion. The psychic sponge of the zodiac. A healer disguised as a homebody. They don’t just catch feelings — they *host* them, *feed* them, and knit them a weighted blanket.

They’re protective like a mom with court documents, nostalgic like an ex who never moved on, and quietly psychic like your great-grandma who cursed people via soup.

**The Pros of a Cancer:**
- **Loyal AF:** Ride-or-die unless you betray them, then just *die.*
- **Empathetic:** Can read your energy before you even text.
- **Creative:** Writes novels, bakes trauma into pies, paints grief like a memory.
- **Protective:** Will fight *for* you, *over* you, and *because of* you.

**The Cons of a Cancer:**
- **Moody:** Ruled by the Moon = 400 moods a day.
- **Passive-aggressive:** Won’t confront you, but will *haunt* you.
- **Clingy (with flair):** Emotionally Velcroed to people they don’t even like anymore.
- **Petty:** Doesn’t get mad, gets *ancestral.*

## 🌟 **Cancer Sun vs. Cancer Moon: Who’s Crying, Who’s Cursing, Who’s Cooking?**

**☉ Cancer Sun:**

Their *whole self* is lunar-coded. They love deeply, feel constantly, and express like a Tumblr poet with boundary issues. Sentimental and strategic.
- **Operates like:** “Here’s a homemade gift and a list of ways you’ve hurt me.”
- **Key vibe:** Soft-spoken menace.
- **Shadow side:** Wants you to read their mind — and suffer for not doing it.

**☽ Cancer Moon (Moon’s home sign):**

This is the *purest* Cancer expression. Emotion is their mother tongue. They *are* the vibe, the mood, and the emotional backstory of your trauma.
- **Operates like:** “I don’t want to talk about it — but I want you to *ask.”*
- **Key vibe:** Emotional oracle with food-based coping strategies.
- **Shadow side:** Weaponizes withdrawal like an Olympic sport.

## 🌎 **Cancer in the House(s):**

Here’s where you love, cry, and store emotional receipts.

**Cancer in 1st House:** *“I look soft and I am, until you disrespect my silence.”*

> Leads with intuition and side-eye. Protective, nurturing, and deeply reactive — you’ll know how they feel before they say a word.
- Their whole vibe shifts depending on who just entered the room.
- Looks maternal. May secretly hex.

**Cancer in 2nd House:** *“I need financial security so I can emotionally spiral in peace.”*

> Money = emotional safety. They crave stability, but spending is often driven by feelings.
- Retail therapy isn’t a joke, it’s a lifestyle.
- Sentimental hoarder. Still owns that concert ticket from 9th grade.

**Cancer in 3rd House:** *“I remember everything you said. Especially the tone.”*

> Communicates with feeling. Their words carry warmth or sting, depending on the mood.
- Communicates through vibes, sighs, and voice notes at 2AM.
- Might’ve raised their siblings.

**Cancer in 4th House (Cancer’s home):** *“Home is where I overthink in comfort.”*

> Deeply connected to roots, family, and private life. Home is their sanctuary and their soft spot.
- Childhood hits deep. Family roots run mystical.
- Probably the emotional anchor of their family… whether they like it or not.

**Cancer in 5th House:** *“Creativity = feelings with glitter.”*

> Romance, creativity, and fun are deeply personal. Every crush is a mini-tragedy or fairy tale.
- Their art? Basically a diary entry in disguise.
- Writes love letters, then eats them.

**Cancer in 6th House:** *“I am the emotional support coworker.”*

> Their work habits and daily routines are tied to their emotional state. Hyper-responsible when needed, but secretly resentful.
- Needs emotional support to function.
- Knows everyone’s coffee order and their relationship drama.

**Cancer in 7th House:** *“I love love. Until it gets too real.”*

> Wants connection, but needs to feel emotionally safe first. Relationships are deep and loyal — or they’re nothing.
- Clings when scared, retreats when hurt.
- Will not forgive betrayal — but might parent you through it.

**Cancer in 8th House:** *“My trauma has trauma, but I’ll only talk about it in memes.”*

> Hyper-private about deep emotional wounds. Craves emotional fusion but fears betrayal.
- Says “I’m fine” while plotting emotional escape routes.
- Emotionally intense, sexually intuitive, spiritually terrifying.

**Cancer in 9th House:** *“Spirituality is my emotional coping mechanism.”*

> Looks for meaning through emotion, connection, and experience. Traveling is healing. So is crying under the stars.
- Faith is personal, not institutional.
- Could write a thesis on ancestral healing and cry the whole time.

**Cancer in 10th House:** *“I’m not cold, I’m emotionally employed.”*

> Reputation is tied to caretaking and responsibility. They’re often seen as nurturing leaders — but emotionally burdened ones.
- Quietly ambitious, powered by emotional duty.
- Might run a business like a coven.

**Cancer in 11th House:** *“My friends are my found family, but also my mood swings.”*

> Social connections are meaningful and mood-based. They protect their people — unless those people hurt their feelings.
- Makes emotional support group chats.
- Socially selective but deeply attached.

**Cancer in 12th House:** *“My subconscious remembers everything.”*

> The emotional depths here are unreal. Hyper-sensitive, intuitive, and private. Feels everything but shows almost nothing.
- Likely cries to music alone, then makes a playlist about it.
- Protects their softness by pretending not to care.

## 🦀 **Cancer 101: Signs, Houses, and Why the Moon Cries**

**Cancer rules the 4th House,** which is all about:
- Home & family
- Emotional roots
- Ancestry, privacy, comfort

**And it’s ruled by the Moon,** which governs:
- Feelings
- Instincts
- Moods
- The *unspoken* stuff

So:
- Cancer = the sign of psychic nurturing
- 4th House = the emotional basement of your chart
- Moon = the mother, the tides, the mood board of your soul

Cancer teaches us that vulnerability *is* strength — and that sometimes the most radical thing you can do is protect your peace with both soup and salt.

## ✨ **Wrap-Up:**

Cancer is the emotional anchor of the zodiac. They feel what others avoid. They protect what others forget. And they will defend the people they love with both kindness *and* mild emotional blackmail.

They’re not weak — they’re *wavelength workers.* Don’t mistake the softness for softness. Inside every Cancer is a lunar warrior with psychic claws and a three-generation grudge.

> Tag the crab who cries and curses in the *same* breath, or share with the friend who turned their heartbreak into a home-cooked meal and a moon ritual.

> **Gemini spilled the tea. Cancer cried in it, named it after their grandma, and turned it into a healing ritual.**

**Next up:** Leo, the cosmic celebrity who will light up the room, demand applause, and casually save your life with a 10-minute monologue.",2,1746391254.0,TeaWith10H,0,1.0,False

1. The circular screen cuts off words.  Yeah.  It does.  It's a coffee machine. Not a computer. Should this have been thought out prior to production?  Yes. Does it make a difference?  No.

2. Turning the dial sometimes does nothing.  True.  You can turn the dial 1 click at a time, and it's hit or miss if it changes the line.  The solution is to turn the dial a bunch of clicks at a time until you land on the right spot. Should someone from the UI team be fired for the first 2 issues?  Yes. It's unacceptable from a company that wants to be the ""Apple"" of the coffee industry. Does it matter to me? Not in the least.

3. The build quality is cheap, and it bends when you push down it.  So don't push down on it.  I seriously don't care that it isn't made out of the richest of materials.  It's perfectly fine.  It's a freaking coffee machine, not a piece of art. It's totally fine, and if that's the corner they cut to keep the price down in a reasonable range, then cool.

4. The water tank is small.  It is.  So what.  Fill it up more often.



All of the above are ridiculous gripes that literally no one should use to either buy or not buy the machine.  The below are my 2 biggest issues with the Aiden:



\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*5) The carafe.  Oh, the carafe.  It's absolutely horrendous.  It's the biggest issue with the machine, and I can't believe they didn't make an insulated carafe. It's very close to a deal breaker and is a deal breaker if you want to make a batch of coffee and sip on it throughout the morning.  It holds nothing hot for more than a few minutes.  Seriously.  You can't possibly make 10 cups of coffee if you plan on going back to it in 30 minutes.  It will be lukewarm, gross, and you'll have to put it in the microwave.  FOR THE LOVE OF G-D FELLOW, PLEASE COME OUT WITH AN ACTUAL INSULATED CARAFE THAT WE CAN BUY AS AN ACCESSORY.  IT'S UNACCEPTABLE.\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*



6) 10-cup carafe.  Sounds great, right?  Well, Fellow considers 1 cup to be 5 ounces.  5 ounces???  Give me a break.  A cup should be 10-12 ounces.  So a 10-cup carafe holds 5 10-ounce cups?  Lulz. Almost false advertising.



7) The water tank doesn't have a sensor to make sure if has enough water to finish the program you want to run.  The Aiden can tell you don't have the correct coffee filter, but not water?  Seems like an oversight. Should it be there?  Yes. Absolutely. Is it a dealbreaker? No, but since the tank is small, you really do have to check it every single time.



So that it's it's fantastic.  I don't feel like I need to talk about the pluses.  Anyone looking at the Aiden knows what it is supposed to do and why it is different.  It does those things very, very well.  The carafe is an absolute deal breaker for anyone who wants to come back to hot coffee after 30 minutes if they are going to make 8 cups for the morning.  It really is disappointing, and Fellow really does need to offer an insulated carafe that works with Aiden.  Other than that, it's great with some minor quibbles in #6 and 7 above.",0,1746391191.0,FellowProducts,11,0.4,False

[Breville Barista Pro],"I am using a breville barista pro with the new baratza grinder. I am using Heritage Beans from Pilot Coffee roasters link: https://pilotcoffeeroasters.com/products/heritage-blend?srsltid=AfmBOopc_neM7TiPagg0H3XxKIrj3ywsXlNIQ98zhuAglXG7LQXaDb0N
The bag I am using was roated on April 10th.

My internal burr setting is on 4 and the grind setting is on 8. This seemed to give me a yield of 40g in 33 seconds with 18g of beans. But the taste is still sour. Adjusting the grind setting to 4 makes the shot pull slower but it is still sour. I tried raising the temperature a bit but still gives me that sour taste. 

Not sure what I am doing wrong. Help!",1,1746391164.0,espresso,16,0.67,False
1kettdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/novarent/comments/1kettdq/room_for_rent_near_ballston_1062/,Room for Rent Near Ballston $1062,"Hello!

We are three roommates (M, early 30s), looking for a fourth to take a master bedroom in our four bedroom house.  Available 7/1.

We are equidistant between Ballston and Eden Center, sitting right on the W&OD trail, and the 1A/1B bus route.  Westover is also a short walk from the house.  The room is a large master bedroom with a private bathroom and private balcony.  I have not measured the room exactly, but it takes up a third of the upstairs space.  We do have a dog in the house, so unfortunately we cannot accommodate any further pets per the lease.  

The house features a fully furnished living room, complete with a coffee/espresso bar, Bluetooth and vinyl sound systems, a piano, and potential office space if needed.  We also have a fully equipped kitchen with a gas stove/oven.  The house is far away from the main road and does not pick up outside noise.  Our backyard is spacious, and is equipped with a deck, fire pit, and a charcoal grill.  There is also plenty of room to set up planters if you have a green thumb.  And while the neighborhood is very quiet and we have never had any issues, the exterior of the house is protected by a security system.

We are all chill and in our early to mid 30s.  We are fairly relaxed and social in the house, watching tv and hanging out in the living room regularly.  We enjoy a respectful, drama free environment that we would like to keep.  One of us works from home, one works a hybrid home/office deal, and the other works completely on site.  All we ask of an incoming roommate is to be clean and respectful of common spaces, as we do not believe in chore charts or the like.  Incoming roommates as well must be LGBT friendly.

Rent is 1062, which includes landscaping costs to maintain the yard and remove leaves in the fall.  This does not include utilities, (gas, power, sewer, water, FIOS) which range from 100-200 depending mostly on whether the AC is running or not.  On signing the lease, one months rent and a deposit of $787 are required from the landlord.

Please DM me if you are interested, and I can send pics of the room or more information as needed ",1,1746391155.0,novarent,0,1.0,False

I'm in counselling and everything to help me with the grieving process, but I still feel like I struggle a lot with being able to sit down and work. It's not that I necessarily think about them while working, but it's almost like my brain refuses to work with me, even when I try and take my medication (with coffee!). It's gotten to a point where it's impeding on my work, and as much as I want to tell myself that it'll take time for me to heal, I feel like I don't have that privilege right now.

Does anyone have any advice?",2,1746391103.0,adhdwomen,4,1.0,False

1ketrrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ketrrf/gpt_4o_making_stuff_up/,GPT 4o making stuff up,"I've been having a great time using GPT and other LLM's for hobby and mundane tasks. Lately I've been wanting to archive (yes, don't ask) data about my coffee bean's purchase of the past couple of years. I have kept the empty bags (again, don't ask!) and took quick, fairly bad pictures of the bags with my phone and threw them back at different  AIs including GPT 4o and o3 as well as Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp. I asked them to extract actual information, not 'inventing' approximations and leaving blank where uncertain.

GPT 4o failed magisterially, missing bags from pictures, misspelling basic names, inventing tasting notes and even when I pointed these things out it pretended to review, correct, change it's methodology to create new errors - it was shockingly bad.  I was shocked at how terrible things got and the only got worst as I tried to give it further cues. It's as if it was trying to get information (bad one) for memory instead of dealing with the task at hand. I deleted many separate attempts, tried feeding it 1 picture at a time. o3 was worst in the sense that it omitted many entries, wasted time 'searching for answers' and left most fields blank.

Gemini on the other hand was an absolute champion, I was equally shocked but instead by how amazing it was. Extremely quick (almost instantaneous), accurate, managed to read some stuff I could barely make up myself zooming into pictures. So I wonder, what could explain such a dramatic difference in result for such a 'simple' task that basically boils down to OCR mixed with other methods of ..reading images  I guess ?

EDIT - ok, reviewing Gemini's data, it contains some made up stuff as well but it was so carefully made up I missed it - valid tasting notes but..invented from thin air. So..not great either.

They used the tiniest shred of evidence to ""prove"" that I was incompetent or a bad person. 

Bullies never act alone. They always need support from an ally and management. That's why they feel emboldened to behave like human trash. This shit makes them feel powerful. They lash out at targets they find threatening or who heighten their insecurities. 

My bullies have all been morbidly obese and couldn't even make eye contact with me most of the time. They were pathetic cowards who had to project ""strength"" by bullying and harassing others (behind their backs and covertly).

Up until about six months ago I’ve been in sales for all of my working life (12yrs). I hadn’t made less than 70k since 2021 with my best year at about 140k. After leaving my last job my wife and I agreed for me to become a pharmacy technician and walk away from sales. In her eyes, stability is what our family needs and for the most part I agree with her. 


I’m working part time at a coffee shop for the time being and almost ready to take my exam, but recently I find myself missing sales. Not only that but I’ve lately felt like I’m wasting my potential and what I know I can do. I’m not sure if it’s just shiny object syndrome or if my gut is right. 


Sales is obviously not “stable” in the traditional sense. But in my head I’m weighing out a 50-60k stable income doing something that I frankly don’t actually want to do, and an unpromised 80-100k+ potential income. 


The challenge is that I’ve been mostly selfish with my career in the past. The biggest reason I got on the same page as my wife with this is because of that fact. I didn’t want to be selfish again and I know that with a family and a house, stability is really appealing.

After seeing how awesome the Marvel Addon by u/Similar-Ad-6527 turned out, I figured — hey, DC fans deserve some love too!  
So I took inspiration from his project, forked it, and built the **DC Universe Addon** for Stremio.

https://preview.redd.it/ewlu8c78qtye1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=698a41a3ce91c2b9f3582a748c5442889ed97ea2

Now you can dive into the entire DC Universe — movies, series, and animations — all neatly organized by timeline, release date, or content type.  
It’s fast, lightweight, and automatically updated every month!

# 🚨 What’s inside:

* 🌀 **Full DCEU timeline** (curated and in chronological order)
* 🚀 **Optimized** for performance and speed
* 🎞️ **Browse by** movies, series, or animations
* 📅 **Filter** by release date
* ⚡ **Monthly auto-updates** via GitHub Actions
* 📚 **Posters and metadata** from TMDb/OMDb
* 📦 **No filler, no duplicates** — just pure DC content

>**📌 Note:** Currently, the addon fetches content from **2010 onwards**.  
More catalogs can definitely be added based on user requests — so if there’s something you want included, I’d love to hear it!

**Note:** The addon is still under review for publication on the official Stremio Addons page.  
For installation, please check the comments or visit my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tapframe/addon-dc) for the installation link.

I read here and there, to use more heat from the start, today I tried to roast the coffee and was so fast, like really fast.  
  
TP at 139°C 1:30, YP 158° 4:00 (was difficult to understand yp, it looked yellow way before, but I waited and for my eyes this was the real start of YP), 1st crack 181°C at 7:20.  
  
After 1st I had the RoR dropping really low, because I lowered the heat, and was like right away from 12°C RoR to 2°C. Out at 10:58 190°C. 250g in 216.5 out.

This is my 24th batch done with the Skywalker V1. 

I give you the description of the coffee;

From Java Sindoro, 1600mt 1800mt.  
SCA Score 87.5

Processing;   
In this processing method, only the ripest red cherries are picked.  
Dry anaerobic fermentation in sealed tanks – 3 days  
Submerged fermentation without yeast – 4 days  
Open-air drying – 3 days  
Tunnel drying – 14 days  
Resting – 7 days  
Final tunnel drying – 7 days (until ideal moisture)  
Resting (dried cherries) – 1 month  
Manual hulling and sorting

By the way, was the most strange green coffee ever.   
When I opened the package the smell was so good.  
During roast was sweet, macereted red fruits, chocolate, but at the end of roast was still sweet and with notes of chocolate, but with a nice note of anise.   
Normally I don't cup, but tomorrow I will cup this coffee, I am too curious

**Content Note:** explicit sexual content

**Blurb:** Adriana thought love was supposed to be simple. You commit, you stay, you build a life. But after the end of her marriage, she’s back in her Brazilian hometown with nothing but doubts—and a matchmaking program promising to fix them. *The Love Blueprint* is the latest creation from the Cupidona do Coração, the town’s legendary matchmaker, and Adriana is ready to put her heart in the hands of science.

What she doesn’t expect? That her dating coach will be Gabriel Vega—her grumpy landlord, the Cupidona’s son, and a man who doesn’t believe in love at all.

Gabriel knows too much about how love falls apart to trust it himself. But with the matchmaking business getting negative reviews because of his incurable bachelor status, he needs to do something to fend off the critics. He offers Adriana a deal: she’ll pose as his girlfriend to help salvage the Cupidona’s brand, and in return, he’ll coach her through the dating curriculum—one fake date at a time.

**Excerpt:**

*If paying bills wasn’t a concern, what would you spend your days doing?*

*A.L.: Restoring old cars (Your partner guessed: Sell coffee out of a converted old car.)*

*G.S.V.: Probably same as always (Your partner guessed: I have no idea? Sky diving? Deep sea fishing? You’re too hard to know!)*

—

“What are you grinning about?”

Her mother meant to sound curious, but Adriana had known Selma Lobo long enough to catch the judgement beneath the question. The matriarch of the Lobo family wasn’t asking why she was grinning. No, she was asking how she could possibly be grinning at a time like this—when Adriana had lost everything: her marriage, her home, her sense of self.

Though that last one felt a scootch better these days. Who would’ve thought wallowing in self-pity wasn’t the most effective way to get over an ex-wife? Adriana had needed a few attempts—including but not limited to quitting the job said ex-wife had hooked her up with—to figure out how to move on.

“It’s this app I’m on. *The Love Blueprint*. After talking to the Cupidona do Coração about my limited experience, she set me up with some coach of hers to get practical experience.” Adriana glanced at her phone, then quickly locked the screen as her cousin Lucia leaned in for a peek.

“Show me! If you’re going the matchmaking route, the least you can do is show me the guy. Maybe I know him. I could give you some insights—like whether or not he’s an axe-wielding murderer,” Lucia said, reaching for her phone.

**Type of Feedback I Want:** I’m looking to get this out to agents soon, so anything that helps me polish up some more!

**Preferred Timeline:** I’m looking at 4 weeks turnaround max. Finished today, so I need some time away - but not too much.

**Critique Swap Availability:** Happy to do a swap for contemporary romance or romantasy, since I know most about those genres.

When I think of all the men I’ve dated, this is a thread or pattern I feel acutely. My boyfriend currently is the best at this from anyone I’ve dated but even then, I feel like it’s been a long road to get him to open up more. 

I was watching Penn Badgley recently doing his podcast/interview circuit promoting the new season of _You_ and I am awestruck by how deep this man is. He’s spiritual, a dedicated father and husband and seems so in touch with his emotions and who he is as a person. I hate this term but this man has clearly “done the work.”

I found myself feeling somewhat depressed after this. I know I can grab a coffee with any of my girlfriends and have these kinds of deep conversations but the number of men I know in my life that I can do that with is in the single digits. 

How can this be? And women here who do know men like this, how did they get there? Am I romanizing this too much? Perhaps - we all know men who self-proclaim as feminists or whatever and are secret a**holes… but I’d like to believe that there are those who are genuine.
