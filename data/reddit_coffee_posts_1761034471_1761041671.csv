SYDNEY (Reuters) -Donald Trump's backing of Australia's critical minerals will bring much-needed financial support to the industry, but experts say the U.S. president will have to wait longer to shift the supply chain away from China and weaken its market dominance.

In a wide-ranging agreement signed on Monday, U.S. and Australia committed a combined $3 billion to mining and processing projects, and to a price floor for critical minerals, a step long sought by Western miners. The countries will also sign off on financing that includes offtake rights.

The White House said U.S. investments into Australia would unlock deposits of critical minerals worth $53 billion, without offering many details.

Trump said in a year they would have ""so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won't know what to do with them.""

""They will be worth about $2,"" Trump told reporters in a news conference later.

Global mining industry experts gathered at a conference in Sydney on Tuesday welcomed the news, which they said would open up investment opportunities, but they were sceptical of Trump's time horizon.

""The time frame for various projects to be ready even for 2027 would be heroic, and unachievable in the case of many projects,"" Barrenjoey analyst Dan Morgan told Reuters.

""In general in the rare earths industry nothing can happen quickly. I don’t think we are going to be swamped with supply growth and there’s no way we will be swamped in a year. We might have supply growth in 5-7 years,"" he said.

China accounts for 90% of the world's refining capacity for rare earths which have crucial uses in sectors such as clean energy, defence and automobiles. In a note on Monday flagging risks of supply disruptions, Goldman Sachs noted China also controls 69% of global rare earth mining, and 98% of magnet manufacturing.

While rare earths are common in the Earth's crust, China has mastered the technically difficult and environmentally-harmful refining process, comparatively cheaply.

With trade tensions and security concerns rising, the U.S. and its Western allies have been looking to loosen China's grip. In April and May, Beijing squeezed global automakers with export curbs on a range of rare earths items and related magnets, and earlier this month expanded its export controls.

Benchmark prices in China for the most popular type of processed rare earths, NdPr oxide rallied by 40% to $88 a kilogram in August, after several years of weakness.

They have since tailed back to $71, but western world developers are calling for governments to support a higher floor price that will enable them to build production.

It's unrealistic to expect prices to drop further and the market to be swamped with supply in the short term, said Dylan Kelly, head analyst at fund Terra Capital.

""Prices right now aren’t necessarily reflective of a market dynamic that can see prices fall any further,"" Kelly said, adding that Monday's announcement had increased the investment allure of Australian projects.

""There’s lot out there to sink our teeth into that could really shift the gear on a number of different projects for us.""

BOOST TO MINERS

However, there were some clear winners from the announcement.  
The U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) sent seven Letters of Interest (LOIs) totalling more than $2.2 billion to miners in Australia, including Arafura Rare Earths.

Arafura CEO Daryl Cuzzubbo said earlier this month that it need $800 million in equity funding to develop its Nolans project in Western Australia, and he expected about 60% of that would come from cornerstone investors by the end of the year.

""It's good for us, and it's good for our industry counterparts,"" said Arafura CFO Peter Sherrington, speaking at the Imarc mining event. ""The big thing it does is derisk raising money from an equity perspective.""

Full funding is expected by the end of the first quarter next year and Arafura aims to start production in 2029, Cuzzubbo earlier told Reuters.

Arafura's biggest shareholder is Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart, a vocal Trump supporter who attended the president’s inauguration party in Mar-a-Lago in January.

However, new critical minerals projects will not be viable without a change in buying priorities from customers, said Syrah Resources CEO Shaun Verner.

""I would say that if customers don't cure their addiction to lowest possible cost supply from China, then there will be no inducement of projects anywhere else.""

[Anthony Albanese and Donald Trump have committed Australia and the US to each provide at least US$1bn towards a pipeline of projects involving rare earth minerals. Photograph: Anna Moneymaker\/Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/4z0h1f92qfwf1.png?width=3800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4525e8fd9934c33defb81127ed9d7ba0b0120d9)

Australia and the US have [signed a critical minerals deal](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/20/albanese-at-the-white-house-trump-endorses-aukus-signs-85bn-rare-earths-deal-and-calls-pm-great-leader) designed to break China’s near complete hold over materials essential to commercial, clean energy and advanced military hardware.

Anthony Albanese and Donald Trump have committed to each provide at least US$1bn ($1.54bn) towards a $US8.5bn ($13bn) pipeline of projects in both countries over the next six months to feed their commercial and defence industries.

Here are five key takeaways.

1. **1.** Albanese named two ‘priority projects’ in Australia The Australian prime minister specifically referred to two “priority projects”, one by Alcoa and the other by Arufura Rare Earths, that will get an injection of capital from the government as part of a broader list. The first is a proposed gallium plant in Western Australia, to be co-located at one of Alcoa’s alumina refineries. Gallium is a strategic mineral vital for modern technologies like military equipment – including in advanced electronic warfare systems such as missile guidance technology and radar. The US is wholly dependent on gallium imports, with China having near complete dominance over its production – it is typically churned out as a byproduct by the country’s vast network of aluminum smelters.
2. The deal aims to end China’s monopoly on rare earth production China is a large producer of rare earths and has [near-complete control over the refining processes](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/07/china-has-a-stranglehold-on-the-worlds-rare-earths-supply-chain-can-australia-break-it) needed to make the minerals useful. It also produces about 90% of rare-earth magnets. Its [recent curbs on supplies](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/china-steps-up-control-rare-earth-exports-national-security-concerns) has shown how reliant the rest of the world now is on its supplies. The Australian government announced it will provide a $US100m equity injection into the Arafura Rare Earths project, located north of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory.  The company, backed by Australia’s richest person, Gina Rinehart, plans to produce the rare earth oxides – neodymium and praseodymium – crucial to the production of magnets. Rare-earth magnets are used in wind turbines, medical devices, combustion and electric motors and ballistic missile guidance systems. The US government is considering investing up to $US300m, but first requires further due diligence. Australia has some rare earths processing capability through Lynas’ WA facility and the government has backed the development of a project by Iluka designed to produce several oxides.
3.  The deal doesn’t necessarily mean Australia will become a high-end manufacturer Rare earths oxide in Australia would still need to be transported to global partners for metallization, followed by magnet-making, given Australia does not currently have the manufacturing processes. Tim Buckley, director of thinktank Climate Energy Finance, says it is urgent to position Australia as “more than a quarry digging and shipping our raw commodities”. Government-commissioned [modelling](https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/critical-minerals-strategy-2023-2030#download-a-pdf-copy-of-the-report) has shown building refining and processing capability for critical minerals means a greater share of trade and job creation.
4. The end product is designed for delivery to US and Australian buyers - not China In recent years, Australian government officials have crisscrossed the country offering grants, funding and other assistance in order to develop domestic processing capabilities for critical minerals. The mix of government money and public shareholder money raises questions over who the projects will sell to, and at what price, given China is the world’s dominant buyer of materials that go into the production of high-grade magnets. The new framework is designed for delivery to American and Australian buyers and the deal is intended to support the supply of the minerals for the benefit of both countries’ commercial and defence industries. One representative of a critical minerals project told Guardian Australia the company was “mindful of the context in which we’ve been funded” and that there’s an assumption they “won’t be making many sales to Chinese customers”. The framework also discusses developing price floors. Non-Chinese resources companies have long complained that Beijing’s near complete control over the supply chain means that it controls benchmark pricing. This creates a problem for new producers, given prices could be kept low to prevent new projects from being feasible – an issue addressed through having a price the various critical minerals will not drop below.
5. Investors are profiting already Australian critical minerals companies have enjoyed a stellar several weeks, with share prices rocketing amid hopes a new mineral boom has taken hold. Shares in Arafura are up more than 150% in a month, enriching investors, while the Australian mining sector has described the framework as a “landmark step forward for both nations’ economic and strategic futures”. There are, however, some voices [within Labor](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/21/diplomatic-triumph-or-capitulation-albanese-found-donald-trump-in-a-heavenly-mood-but-the-devil-may-be-in-the-detail) describing the deal as “selling off the family silver”, with government fact sheets showing that America will get prime access through offtake agreements. There is also the lingering question over how China will respond.

# ✅ Positioned at the center of the U.S. Critical Minerals strategy, NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project offers:

* Multiple **Top 10 USGS-listed minerals**
* Supply chain independence from China
* Vertical integration across mining, advanced processing, and **future recycling**
* Alignment with the **MCS (Multilateral Commercial Stockpile)**, **DoD offtakes**, **EXIM funding**, and the new SMR Critical Minerals Hub

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# ⚔️ NIOCORP — “Battle Stations"": THE WEEK OF IGNITION (TUESDAY UPDATE)”

**Tuesday, October 21, 2025 — 06:00 EST | Pre-Market: $9.90 (+2.3%) | Volume: 70K | Float Tension: Critical**

**The battle lines are drawn**. Niocorp opens pre-market just a whisper under $10, and the tape looks *primed for ignition.* After last week’s full-float rotation — nearly 100M shares changing hands — the setup has gone from *technical compression* to *potential detonation. IM*HO \~ Shorts are cornered, institutions are dug in, and the catalysts are now stacked in a perfect firing sequence. **With EXIM, drill results, and defense-aligned Sc-Al news all within days to weeks, even a minor headline could be the spark that ignites a short-covering inferno.**

🔥 **The Powder Keg Scenario — “Shorts in the Blast Zone”**  
At $9.50+, the short defense line starts to crumble. Once that level breaks decisively, margin pressure will force covering — especially for late entries from the offering dip. Many shorts built positions between $7.80–$8.50 expecting a fade post-raise, but they underestimated the institutional lock and sequence of pending catalysts. The float has effectively been reallocated upward, and any positive drill core or offtake headline becomes the match in a powder room filled with dry fuse. ***No liquidity. No exit.***

💥 **Catalysts in Immediate Range (T-Minus 48–72 Hours):**  
1️⃣ **Drill Results #2 & #3** — Labs have confirmed assays queued. A repeat or upgrade of Hole #1’s 1.33% Nb₂O₅ / 3,000 ppm TREO intercept detonates the valuation model and breaks the short dam.  
2️⃣ **Offtake Confirmations** — Negotiations for Sc, Nb, Ti & REE's appear to be at term-sheet stage. Even one signed deal could flip EXIM’s “conditional” to “active,” unlocking the final FID approval path.  
3️⃣ **Defense-Prime Sc-Al Reveal (GENVI/DoD)** — The quiet giant. If announced this week or next, it validates Niocorp’s strategic positioning as the *only U.S. scandium-aluminum supply chain node.*

⚙️ **Operational + Policy Alignment — The ‘Trident’ Effect**  
With capital secured ($300M), EXIM alignment locked, and a triad of investor stages (Maxim, RedChip, ThinkEquity) stacked across the next 10 days, this isn’t random motion — it’s a coordinated launch. The market structure now resembles a compression spring under load. The ignition window (Oct 21–Nov 8) is live, and *any* data or partnership release now becomes an accelerant.

**Bottom Line:**  
Niocorp enters Tuesday’s trade like a live ordnance. The chart says “compression,” the volume says “accumulation,” and the pre-market bid says “anticipation.” Shorts above $9.50 are officially inside the blast radius. Any confirmed catalyst — drill core, offtake, or Sc-Al partner — could set off the powder keg and send this thing vertical before the week is out.

**“This isn’t hype. It’s physics — pressure has nowhere left to go but up.”** 🚀

We have been together for 22 years. I think this is the longest we have been away from one another and we have an over all strong relationship.

A little back story - i have never left our country (dying to travel) but its my choice to continue to pump all my money into our family and home. I am waiting patiently to travel once our children have finished school / uni. Im the main care giver and the bread winner of our family. My husband gets these opportunities that are paid for him (basically a work trip) - Im not allowed to accompany him on these tripe (work rules). So im living through his experiences. 

I pick him up from the airport and he tells me one or 2 stories about the trip. Once at home, I make him a cup of coffee and we both lie in bed - he proceeds to doom scrolling ignoring me whilst I sit and wait patiently (i know there are lots of stories etc to be told as he has hinted to them during the trip). I then ask him to tell me about the trip and he continues to scroll without looking or touching me and says there is not much to tell. 

I then tell him thats BS and tell him its rude to come home and just scroll. He tells me he's tired and that im over reacting and 'need to calm down' - the worst words to say to your wife. He continued to be condescending and an AH to be honest. I lost my patience and told him to F off. He does not normally speak to me like this. I have a big problem with disrespect and reacted to this disrespect but he was looking at me as if I was the crazy one and has me quietly questioning if I was the AH?

1oc8xjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oc8xjg/i_have_no_friends_at_28/,I have no friends at 28,"Hi. F28 here. I'm not really sure where to start.   
I was diagnosed with depression about 6 years ago, and since then, I've been to therapy, I've been on meds, and generally things improved with time. I've always been socially awkward, which got into my way of making friends. I was bullied into the ground in primary school, I was an outsider in highschool, and only when I started working and then university, did I find some friends. But I've graduated now, and we've all gone back to our home cities.   
I have some online people I occassionally play games with, but I always feel out of place. No-one ever really reaches out to me. I had no-one but my family to celebrate my birthday with this year. I always feel left out, like I've done something wrong and I'm an unlikeable person, and I don't understand why. I've had my ups and downs with people, we've straightened things out over time, but I am still on my own.   
These days I feel extremely lonely. I've come to rely on work to keep myself distracted. I'm a teacher in a primary school, and I love my job. I've met great colleagues, but it's a job where most people are older, and I still have no-one to hang out with, go out for a coffee or anything. I'm not sure what to do. It feels like the few friends I have, have moved on and found better people to be around with. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong. I always joke, we always banter, but somehow it feels hollow, and I'm always the one to reach out. I like video games, D&D and occassionally do fantasy roleplay, but I feel like I am never included in much. I'm always sitting at my PC, wondering what to do and with whom. People seem to almost never be around.   
I've had suicidal thoughts before, got pretty close to ending it a couple of times, but I always pushed through. Oddly enough, I wouldn't say I'm at that point again, which I guess is a small improvement, which I find very strange. This stuff was enough to drive me into a suicidal mood before. I don't want that to happen again. All I want is to feel connected. Does anyone, who has dealt with something like this, have any advice? I don't know what to do or if I'm doing something that's putting people off. ",2,1761041112.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I wonder if anyone has any idea what could be wrong with me or experiences anything similar? I have some signs of cfs like post exertional malaise and tiredness, but I am also immediately weak when exercising, and have permanent pain in my legs and a feeling of being drunk that lasts until around 10:30 each morning. My eyes struggle to track moving objects because they look blurred to me. I react to many foods by feeling drunk and spaced out, with more healthy foods and teas/coffee making me feel worse. My serotonin marker was normal and so was my cortisol (oat test). DAO and all other supplements are not helpful and make me feel worse. High carbohydrate and sugar foods are fine, fatty foods can make me a bit unwell. The only positive result I have is black mould above the threshold in a mycotoxins, but not severely elevated, and high pyruvate in an oat test but it was a mail in test.

1oc8sj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1oc8sj8/im_starting_to_see_favoritism_everywhere_i_work/,I’m starting to see favoritism everywhere I work and it’s exhausting,"i work at a very busy McDonald’s (not in the USA though) and just started working here 3 months ago before quitting my old job at Amazon as a warehouse associate. It’s my third month in and i already got to know everyone intimately since there isn’t much room inside to walk around anyway and i’ve also come to realise that *favouritism* exists everywhere, even if you feel like it doesn’t affect you (at work or school, sports, etc), it does but in a minor way, which ultimately will affect you somehow, you just need to notice a pattern and spot who or what is favoured over others. In my case it’s the issue with women at my work getting wayyy easier tasks than me and my male colleagues even though our job description and pay remains the same. It’s the reason why i left Amazon but i’m now dealing with it in Mcdonald’s.  

When i used to work as a warehouse associate at Amazon, we had 4 women and around 15 guys in the warehouse on a given day. The tasks usually vary, some being harder than others. Scanning, hauling, moving around pallets were usually the typical but (harder) tasks due to lifting heavy things being involved. The easiest task was sorting, which means you just had to stand behind the conveyor belt and push the package to A or B with your hand. And guess who got these tasks? The women. The thing is, i never have and will have an issue with working with women. But when I’m breaking my back, sweating around a warehouse doing grunt work and i see my counterpart doing a job 100% easier than mine, for the same pay and responsibilities for the majority of their shift, i can’t help but to feel shit about it. And since the supervisors know that they can’t really do the other tasks due to being weak and get along well with the women, they won’t ask them and never will to also perform other tasks which we men have to do. 

Right now at Mcdonald’s, i’m facing a similar problem. At Mcds we have 2 main roles, which all of us share responsibilities and is included in our job description, kitchen work and front (counter) work. Kitchen work means everything from frying the meats, prepping the buns, burgers, hauling the frozen meats from the freezer to the kitchen, etc. Front work is basically packing the goods that the kitchen workers made into takeaway bags, or serving them on a tray to the customers to their tables. On top of making coffees and matchas lattes. Can you guess which job is easier? Front work of course. Because packing happy meals and giving kids complimentary chocolate pops and overall having a smile on your face is much easier to do for 8 hours than burning your fingers from the grill and having oil all over your body and clothes back in the kitchen. 

My job description (all of us at mcdonald’s, unless you’re a supervisor) literally says “rotation system” meaning we rotate between kitchen and front. But from what i’ve learned, the supervisors here basically keep most of the women in the front, and all the guys are in the kitchen, basically all the time. I don’t know why, but it is what it is. And by the way we’re getting paid the same. The only difference is one of us goes home with blisters all over their fingers and the other goes without. Every. Shift. 

One time at work i decided to just go to the front and teach myself how it works for the first time, since it’s in my job description anyway, and the supervisor saw me and just straight up told me “oh we need you in the kitchen”, like, okay. Back to grilling all day i guess. 

This post is not to hate against women at work or anything like this, please. it’s not my intention. But i just need to vent what’s been bothering me every time i go to work. Which is a big chunk of my life of course. It’s not fair to give people the same responsibility and pay but pick and choose who gets the easier tasks, sometimes it’s due to you being good friends with the worker, in my case it’s the unfair distribution of male and female workers in my last two jobs, again, with SAME PAY. I’ve thought about complaining to management about this, but i’ve not thought much about it and keep telling myself “you need the job, just work and go home, forget about it”, but ultimately it pisses me off when i’m in the kitchen with scrapping the grill all day and i look at the girls in the front smiling and making happy meals. I don’t know, it doesn’t sit right with me. ",1,1761040618.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Had this explosive fight 3 weeks ago and haven’t been in contact since.

Feels like he has been posting stuff online with very loaded captions. 

I have tried to not give in to the drama by taking some time off of social media spaces we share. 

Ran into him at a coffee shop we used to go to together. 
I made a quick stop after making sure his car wasn’t around. I was just about to collect my order & leave when I saw his car.

I sort of scurried in to pay for my order and leave but he caught up to me. I tried to not look at him but he asked me how I was & touched my waist (which sort of startled me tbh). I was unsure how to react so I quickly said “i’m good”, smiled, said bye & left.


This not knowing what’s up is so weird to me. I don’t do very well with uncertainty, feels v triggering but I’m trying to handle this as calmly & maturely as possible. 

I think I might have to part ways with the coffee shop, which is very sad because I love their iced lattes. 😭

1oc8pov,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1oc8pov/what_are_your_self_care_routines/,What are your self care routines?,"I feel like “self-care” gets thrown around a lot, and half the time it’s used as a way to justify splurging or avoiding responsibilities. There’s nothing wrong with treating yourself, but I think real self-care is about the boring, consistent things that actually keep you healthy and steady long-term. To me, it’s less about escape and more about building habits that make daily life smoother.

For example, I’ve heard some people take “self-care” trips or buy big-ticket items, only to come back stressed because the important stuff (like bills, savings, or deadlines) was still waiting for them. In those moments, what they really needed was to look after their future selves, not run from the present.

So here’s what self-care looks like for me day to day:

- Brushing and flossing with an electric toothbrush.
- Using a massage gun in the evenings to release tension before bed.
- Keeping my space clean so I don’t start the next day in chaos.
- Walking 30–40 minutes most days.
- Doing some stretching and basic breathing exercises.
- Staying on top of my budget and to-do list.
- Making time for social check-ins (a text, a call, grabbing coffee).
- Journaling at night to plan for tomorrow and clear my head.

Nothing glamorous but these habits make me feel grounded and, like I’m actually taking care of myself instead of just putting out fires.",2,1761040326.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

1oc8p2e,https://i.redd.it/hqa3roafsfwf1.png,"""There's nothing special about this, how could it possibly sell?"" - I genuinely thought that, until...","Well, I’ve been playing with Claude Code for a few months. 

Last week, I decided to create ClaudeKit - that Claude Code Setup bundle with ""subagents"" and ""commands"" for Engineers and Marketers that I wasn't ready to launch yet, but then Claude Code already released their Plugin Marketplace.

I was about to give up, but I stubbornly decided to ask a few more people to see what they thought.

I threw the ClaudeKit link to my younger brother who I usually discuss Claude Code and Open Code with.

He said ***“who tf will buy this?”.***.. it was so embarrassing I couldn't even admit I made it 😂

At this point I started thinking: *“oh yeah true, if you spend a little time tinkering with this stuff you can figure it all out yourself, who would buy this...”*

\--

After that day I went out for coffee and chatted with 2 more friends, brought up ClaudeKit again to test the waters, and both of them said: *“wait, this looks pretty cool actually, just try selling it and see what happens!”*

We sat talking all morning, concluded: *""Alright, I'm gonna sell this pile of markdown files!""*

Even joked that if I can make it they will say *“even just some md files and you can still sell them, truly crazy!”* 😂

\--

After that... **I still procrastinated.**

I thought: *“Let me finish the documentation or tutorial videos first, otherwise when I introduce it, how will anyone know how to use it”* 😅

But I accidentally posted on Reddit talking about this product.

As usual, Reddit was very “brutal” and most comments were roasting it :))

But then... there was 1 sale! 🤯

**Holy shit.**

\--

I screenshot that order and posted it on Facebook to brag haha (I still hadn't officially announced anything about ClaudeKit on Facebook)

And the next order came...

Then another one...

More... and more...

Oh my god, what's happening?

In just 2 days over the weekend, I got 6 orders, without any real promotion.

Went to sleep feeling ecstatic, and woke up to another new order, by Monday noon I had already reached 9 orders, absolutely unbelievable.

**My total revenue in 3 days is $845.1**

What's even better is I received quite a lot of positive reviews on Discord server and X from people both locally and internationally

Honestly felt amazing, couldn't stop smiling all day haha

**Turns out, these “md files” actually sells!**

\--

See that guys, if I had given up early (or procrastinated because of the docs), I wouldn't be seeing this now! 😜

1oc8oh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1oc8oh5/how_im_using_ai_tools_to_survive_college_and_look/,How I’m Using AI Tools to Survive College (and Look Way More Organized Than I Actually Am) FR,"Hey everyone,

I hang out here a lot because I’m obsessed with AI tools. I’m a college student, or maybe just a professional procrastinator with a student ID, and this semester has been chaos. Between trying to keep up with lectures, writing essays that don’t sound like nonsense, and eating something that isn’t instant noodles, I started testing every AI tool I could find just to survive. Some of them sucked, but a few actually changed the game.

Here’s my personal AI lineup that’s keeping me alive this semester.

1. ChatGPT Pro Obviously this is the main one. But FR, I use it for everything. Class notes, essay outlines, rewriting messy drafts, even understanding professor emails that sound like puzzles. Last week I told it, “explain this like I’m tired but need to sound smart,” and it totally worked. I also use it to argue with myself when studying. I’ll say, “act like a classmate who disagrees with me about this theory,” and suddenly I understand the topic ten times better. Not cheating, just surviving.
2. Flow Sometimes I have ideas but my hands are just done typing. Flow is this ridiculously good voice input app that turns my rambling into perfect text. I’ll walk around my dorm and talk my essay out loud, and it writes it like I actually planned it that way. It even understands punctuation, which is insane. Half my papers now start as me talking to my laptop like I’m ranting to a friend. It’s weirdly therapeutic and way faster.
3. [Proactor.ai](https://proactor.ai/) Group projects used to be my personal hell. Everyone talks, no one writes anything down, and two weeks later nobody remembers what we decided. Now I open Proactor in every meeting. It listens, takes notes, and summarizes everything. It even lists who’s supposed to do what. One time I asked it, “what did we agree on last week?” and it gave me a perfect rundown of the tasks. It’s like having the one responsible teammate who never forgets.
4. [Makeform.ai](http://makeform.ai/) Every professor ever loves saying “you’ll need to collect your own data.” I used to groan every time, but now I just open Makeform. You literally tell it what kind of survey you want, like “make a 10 question form about student sleep habits,” and it builds the whole thing instantly. Logic jumps, colors, everything. I once made a whole survey in under three minutes while waiting for coffee. My professor called it “very professional.” I laughed.
5. [AskSurf.ai](http://asksurf.ai/) This one’s my research hack. It’s kind of like ChatGPT but more focused on crypto and tech data. I used it for a paper about social media hype in crypto markets and it gave me actual stats, graphs, and insights that sounded straight out of a finance journal. My professor said, “great use of current data,” and I was just like, yeah sure thanks LOL.

Between ChatGPT Pro, Flow, Proactor, Makeform, and AskSurf, I somehow look like I have my life together. In reality I’m just powered by coffee and vibes. AI doesn’t fix college, but it makes it way more survivable.

If you’ve got any other AI tools that help you stay on track, please drop them below. We’re all just trying to make it through midterms and pretend we know what we’re doing FR LOL.",0,1761040203.0,ChatGPTPro,1,0.5,False

Most “instant lattes” are either too sugary or taste artificial — so when I tried **Zupi Food’s Hot Latte**, I didn’t expect much… but it’s surprisingly *real*.

It’s made with **premium coffee and natural ingredients**, no weird aftertaste, and doesn’t feel heavy like café drinks.  
Here’s what stood out:

* Smooth texture and balanced flavor — not too bitter, not too sweet
* Made from **freshly roasted coffee** and **clean ingredients**
* No preservatives or artificial creamers
* Easy to prepare — just add hot water, and it actually foams a bit

It’s become my go-to **midday energy drink** because it gives that rich café vibe without the crash.  
Also, it pairs perfectly with light snacks — especially Zupi’s **Protein Bhel** (if you like that salty-sweet combo).

Curious — has anyone here found other **instant or ready lattes** that don’t taste artificial?

I’ve developed a habit of drinking tea or coffee 3 to 4 times almost every day at the office. It started as a small thing — just to stay alert or take a short break.

It wasn’t wind.  
It wasn’t animals.

It was like breaking ice. That sharp, brittle *chreeeeeeeek*, metallic almost, like steel cables snapping far away, but hundreds of them. All layered, weaving together *swooo swooo swibble swibble,* A chorus of something unnatural.

At first, I thought it was my imagination. I stopped walking and stood there listening. The sound stopped with me.

Then, when I started moving again,- it followed.

It never came closer. It just moved along the tree line, keeping pace with me. Every few seconds that chorus would rise and fall like breath. I caught myself whispering, “The hell is that?” even though I no one else was around to answer.

When I got to my driveway, it was still there. Behind my house, beyond the fence, in the trees. That awful frozen-spring sound- *chreeeeeeeek, swooo swooo swibble swibble.*

I went inside, locked the door, turned off the porch light, and stood at the kitchen window watching the dark yard.

The sound didn’t stop until well after midnight.   
  
The next morning, I told myself I was overreacting. Maybe it was ice on branches, though it hadn’t frozen in weeks. Maybe it was raccoons, or deer rubbing against metal fencing somewhere.

I even went out there in daylight, just to see what I could see.

The ground under the trees was churned up. No prints, exactly. Just disturbed earth. Like something had dragged itself around in circles.

That night, I left all the lights on. I didn’t hear it again. Not then.

About a week later, I was at my local coffee spot. A great place for a quiet cup of coffee and some quality time with a pen and a notebook.

But that morning, a man slid into the booth across from me without asking. He was filthy, barefoot, layers of shirts and jackets, hair like gray straw. I recognized him. He’s one of the local homeless who camps in the woods near the river. I'd seen him before a couple of times walking the road.

He stared down at my notebook until I closed it. “You live up by Miller’s stretch, don’t ya?”

I didn’t answer at first. “Yeah. Why?”

“You heard ’em,” he said. Not asked. Said.

“Who?”

“Them.” He pointed vaguely toward the window, toward the treeline outside town. “Sound like breakin’ ice, don’t they? Like wires singin’? You should be happy, man.”

“Happy?”

He leaned in close enough I could smell his breath. “They only make that sound when they’re already eatin’.”

I laughed, because what else do you do when someone says something like that? But he didn’t laugh back.

He just stirred his coffee with his finger and whispered, “Some people never come out of the woods- that's why I make camp on the river.""

Then he got up and walked out, leaving his mug and a trail of dried mud behind him.

I didn’t go back to the diner. Didn’t tell anyone about it.

But a few nights later, it started again.

That same chorus.  
That same metallic, wet creaking.

Only this time, it wasn’t behind the trees. It was closer.

Just beyond my fence.

I looked out from my kitchen window and saw shapes. Long, thin, like silhouettes of people stretched too tall. They didn’t move right. Their joints seemed to bend the wrong way, like their bones were made of wire.

Every time one of them twitched, that sound filled the air. That *ice-breaking chorus.*

And underneath it… something wet. A sound like chewing.

I couldn’t see what they were hunched over until one of them shifted, and a pale arm flopped loose from the tangle.

They haven’t left the woods since.

Had a farmer knock on my door asking about his missing dogs. Three of them got loose around dusk and ran off into the woods, chasing something he said. They never came back.  
  
Sometimes, on warm nights, I still hear them at the tree line, singing, creaking, gnawing.

Sometimes the sound moves down the road for a while.

Sometimes it stops behind someone else’s house.

But it always comes back.

Always.

And now, when I hear that awful metallic sound from the trees, I tell myself the same thing that old hippy  told me in the diner.

I should be happy.

Because they only make that sound when they’re eating- and if you can hear it, it’s not you.",2,1761039814.0,cryosleep,0,1.0,False

They even have multiple TVs (second pic) that shows the live status of all the cars they are servicing (kinda like an airport or so LOL). And the lounge has 2 big windows into the actual shop floor as well. The engineers here are quite adept too. Not sure if the proximity to Chakan (manufacturing plant) helps.

They always offer tea/coffee as refreshments, and bottled water. There's even a tea/coffee dispenser next to the lounge. I'm pretty sure they have Wi-Fi as well, but I don't usually stick around long enough to bother using it.

I recently visited for a small recall for my BE6 (minor cap replacement). They took 3 of us on even though it was a holiday for the center in general, and all 3 cars were done and returned in half an hour flat. I was back home before I knew it.

Overall, I recommend this place to anyone in Pune.

I’ve been playing with Claude Code for a few months. 

Last week, I decided to create ClaudeKit.cc - that Claude Code Setup bundle with ""subagents"" and ""commands"" for Engineers and Marketers that I wasn't ready to launch yet, but then Claude Code already released their Plugin Marketplace.

I was about to give up, but I stubbornly decided to ask a few more people to see what they thought.

I threw the ClaudeKit link to my younger brother who I usually discuss Claude Code and Open Code with.
He said ***“who tf will buy this?”***... it was so embarrassing I couldn't even admit I made it 😂

At this point I started thinking: *“oh yeah true, if you spend a little time tinkering with this stuff you can figure it all out yourself, who would buy this...”*

--

After that day I went out for coffee and chatted with 2 more friends, brought up ClaudeKit again to test the waters, and both of them said: *“wait, this looks pretty cool actually, just try selling it and see what happens!”*

We sat talking all morning, concluded: *""Alright, I'm gonna sell this pile of markdown files!""*

Even joked that if I can make it they will say *“even just some md files and you can still sell them, truly crazy!”* 😂

--

After that... **I still procrastinated**.

I thought: *“Let me finish the documentation or tutorial videos first, otherwise when I introduce it, how will anyone know how to use it”* 😅

But I accidentally posted on Reddit talking about this product.

As usual, Reddit was very “brutal” and most comments were roasting it :))

But then... **there was 1 sale!** 🤯

**Holy shit.**

--

I screenshot that order and posted it on Facebook to brag haha (I still hadn't officially announced anything about ClaudeKit on Facebook)

And the next order came...

Then another one...

More... and more...

Oh my god, what's happening?

In just 2 days over the weekend, I got 6 orders, without any real promotion.

Went to sleep feeling ecstatic, and woke up to another new order, by Monday noon I had already reached 9 orders, absolutely unbelievable.

**My total revenue in 3 days: $841.5**

What's even better is I received quite a lot of positive reviews on Discord server and X from people both locally and internationally

Honestly felt amazing, couldn't stop smiling all day haha

**Turns out, these “md files” actually sells!**

See that guys, if I had given up early (or procrastinated because of the docs), I wouldn't be seeing this now! 😜

They say the camera never lies… but I’ve learned it tells stories. Sometimes it captures truth, sometimes imagination, but always a little piece of the person in front of it.

I’m a photographer from Ireland with a love for cinematic storytelling — portraits, travel, and the kind of moments that make life feel a bit more vivid. My work often explores confidence and emotion, and I’m lucky to meet amazing people who trust me to capture both.

Off-camera, I’m inked, music-obsessed, and always chasing a good book or a good laugh. You’ll usually find me wandering with a camera in hand, coffee in the other, or getting lost in a playlist that matches my mood. I love deep chats, dry humour, and those spontaneous plans that turn into great stories later.

I’m here hoping to meet someone kind, curious, and creative — someone who enjoys connection for what it is, whether that’s long talks, shared ideas, or maybe collaborating on something artistic.

Being a member of this sub like you, I say its safe to assume we all going / have gone through a bad time at some point anddd because I don't really speak to people about my problems. I thought I'd give my story, whether it gets read or not, might as well contribute. 

I was in a 6 year relationship. I am now 24(M) from the UK ( Not that it matters ) and this ended when I was 22. Everything was so perfect. But then things started to slow down for some reason. Communication lacked, arguments and more. The feelings were definitely still there ( from my side and I hope hers of course ) but things felt ... different. On the day we broke up, I said "" we've known eachother since we we're 16!, like of course we've changed as people since then and grown into adults and been through that process together, but I think part of that growth has pushed us away from eachother"". 

We both were crying, like knowing someone for that long, and feeling like every single day you move further apart from eachother. We hadn't been intimate in months and things just felt off. I really felt like I hadn't felt love till she came into my life, and now I was throwing that away?. We didn't stay friends. We didn't go for a catch up coffee. We spoke everyday for 6 years, and then at the snap of a finger its like that person didn't exist. I still have the picture in my head of leaving the front door and seeing her crying, and sitting my in my car for hours around the corner. 

When people say ""time heals"" I think i finally get it. Early this year, I realised there were days going past where I didn't think about her. And I saw online somewhere she was with someone new which is great. I'm actually kind of seeing someone myself now too. For anyone out there going through a hard breakup, orr in a situation in a relationship where you feel like its bound to happen, id be lying to you if I said there's a worse feeling. For me it was nature's Ozempic ( trying to slip in a joke for good vibes ) but honestly, nothing feels worse knowing that person you love is still out there, and you can't be next to eachother in the same way you once were. But I swear to you, life goes on. She / he stops coming into your head as much, then hardly at all. You'll always rememeber your first love but the pain of it stops hitting your heart as much. Things actually do get better, and i'm not trying to be cliche when I say that, I have experienced the heartbreak, I've experienced the pain. It really does get better. Whatever you do, just don't give up on yourself. You still haven't met all the people in your life who are going to love you. ",3,1761038494.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

We have never argued, cheated on eachother or anything else, long story short, yesterday we went out for coffee, and i told her that i feel like a friend to her rather then a boyfriend, that i feel like shes not attracted to me anymore and she basically agreed, she told me that she doesnt know why this happened, that i did never wrong and that there was nothing that i did too much or too little. Ive made a desicion to breakup and to cut contact. She suggested staying friends, cuz she still loved me just not as a partner ir even staying together as a couple. I dissagreed because staying friends would be 10x more painfull, and i will never see her as just a friend., and staying as a couple would just be unfair to me.

1oc7waj,https://youtube.com/shorts/9bR5634cEJ0?si=hRigZPZ8K80n_Ay8,Platou is over I am down to 91 Kg very close to my mid term goal #dietet...,"I’m on page “<tabTitle>Szczegóły filmu - YouTube Studio</tabTitle>” with “<selection>Fasting is an art of choosing proper food at proper time. I use many different schools and so far this one seems to be most porofound for me.I did 21 day water fasting and one week recover . After this I am on IF when I stay on 16-18 hr fast and rest enjoy some healthy food</selection>” selected.

Please explain the key concepts in this selection, using simple words. Also, use examples.

Let me break down the key concepts from this text about fasting:

# Fasting as an Art

The person sees fasting not just as ""not eating,"" but as a thoughtful practice - like a skill you develop. Just like an artist chooses colors carefully, they choose what to eat and when to eat it carefully.

**Example:** Instead of randomly skipping meals, they plan it purposefully - like deciding ""I'll eat my meals between 12pm and 6pm"" rather than just forgetting to eat breakfast by accident.

# 21-Day Water Fast

This means they drank only water (no food) for 21 days straight. This is an extreme form of fasting.

**Example:** Imagine drinking only water for three weeks - no breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Just water, tea, or black coffee. It's very challenging and should only be done with medical supervision.

# One Week Recovery

After such a long fast, you can't immediately eat normally. Your body needs time to adjust back to regular food.

**Example:** Like when you wake up and your eyes need time to adjust to bright light - your digestive system needs gentle foods first (like broths, fruits) before returning to regular meals.

# Intermittent Fasting (IF)

Now they follow a daily eating pattern where they fast for 16-18 hours and eat during the remaining 6-8 hours.

**Example:** If they stop eating at 7pm, they don't eat again until 11am-1pm the next day. So they skip breakfast, fast through the morning, then eat lunch and dinner. The nighttime sleep counts toward the fasting hours, making it easier.

The main idea: They're using fasting as a health tool by controlling **when** they eat, not just **what** they eat.

He calls her his dove; she aches for his voice at night. But it’s not all soft lighting and roses. The watchmen rough her up, she looks for him and he’s gone, that gut-punch “where are you?” right in the middle of the passion. It’s not polished romance; it’s the push and pull of intimacy, electric one moment, empty the next.

Lately, I can’t stop thinking about my own marriage. Five years in, bot church kids. We swore God would be our glue and figured that meant we’d be fine. At first it was fire. We’d pray tangled up in bed at midnight, trade verses like inside jokes, fingertips brushing over the same page.

then life crept in. My job drains me dry, seven to collapse. Her freelance eats weekends. Our devotionals became forgotten sticky notes on the fridge. We’d hype a “Bible night,” but then one of us would be too tired, or the sink would clog, or some little thing would kill the moment.

Church still hits hard. “love your wife like Christ loved the church” feels like a brick on my chest. I stopped praying out loud because it elt stiff, scripted. The fights arn’t big, just low-grade hums that keep us apart: coffee left out, air conditioner too cold, emails, TikToks about marriages that look nothing like ours. The silence screams louder than shouting ever did

The bedroom’s the worst heartbreak. She says she’s exhausted, not in the mood, face blank, light dimming. Whdn she finally told me she feels unsexy and burned out, it shattered me. Now we live side by side, not face to face. Bills, laundry, checklists No late-night talks about God. No hands raised together in worship. Just two solo faiths under one roof.

It burns. I get angry at her distance; she gets angry that I don’t see her. Fridays turn into silent wars, Netflix versus forced date nights. We sit on opposite ends of the couch, hearts pounding but miles apart, like Solomon’s lovers wandering through the dark.

Sometimes I still text er a verse in the morning. She snds a heart. It feels empty. I whisper, “God, we need You,” over cold coffee. But maybe that’s the point. Were not meant to wander alone. Even Solomon’s story doesn’t end lost in the night; they find each other again. That’s what divine love does. It digs in when everything’s messy and hard.

So here I am, still fighting for us, one wobbly try at a time. You ever been there? That quiet heartbreak of drifting, where the bed’s cold even with someone next to you, faith feels cracked because your hearts are, and you’re just surviving together? What helped you pull back? A real conversation over coffee, forcing time no matter what, or maybe God throwing you a curveball you didn’t see cming drop it here. Let’s not ache alone n the shadows.

ChatGPT: Modern country song with rich acoustic guitars, pedal steel, and soft drums. Smooth male/female vocals singing about home, love, and open roads. Nostalgic and emotional atmosphere with a heartfelt story. Harmonies and fiddle create warmth and depth. 90 BPM in G major, Nashville-inspired production.

CoPilot: A heartfelt country ballad about leaving home and chasing dreams, with acoustic guitar, steel pedal, and warm harmonies. Lyrics should evoke dusty roads, bittersweet memories, and the pull of the past. Think early morning coffee, faded photographs, and the sound of boots on gravel. Emotional tone: nostalgic but hopeful.

Gemini: Acoustic, classic country song about a truck driver missing his sweetheart. Male vocalist with a deep, warm voice.\*Twangy guitar solo, upright bass, steady snare drum with brushes. Traditional 4/4 rhythm.

TL;DR the Verdict: In my opinion, Copilot and ChatGPT are more descriptive because they don’t just give me a genre or a basic idea, they build a whole emotional world around it. When I ask for a country music prompt, I’m not looking for “sad song with guitar.” I want cracked pavement, ghost-town gas stations, porch lights left on. I want references that carry emotional weight, not just names like Chris Stapleton or Kacey Musgraves, but the feeling behind their music.

Gemini, on the other hand, tends to give me the basics: a genre, a mood, maybe a couple instruments. It’ll say something like “Create a country song with acoustic guitar and emotional lyrics,” and leave me to finish off the prompt. That means I have to add all the detail myself, the imagery, the feeling, the story.

That’s fine if I just want a starting point. But when I’m trying to create something with depth, I prefer prompts that already have texture and direction. Copilot and ChatGPT give me that. Gemini doesn’t at least not in the same way.

Hey everyone,

I’m a complete newbie when it comes to espresso machines. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into research and learned that the grinder is usually more important than the machine and that as a rule of thumb, you should spend more on the grinder than the espresso machine itself.

I just picked up a refurbished Lelit Victoria for €550, which seems like a solid beginner-friendly machine that doesn’t need a ton of tweaking. Now I’m hunting for a good grinder.

I was originally eyeing the K6 for the Black Friday deals, but I’ve seen quite a few comments saying it can produce espresso that’s a bit lacking in body and depth. I’m now considering the J Ultra, which would go for around €160 on sale.

Should I spend more on my grinder? I know that “more expensive” doesn’t always mean “better coffee,” but I can’t shake the feeling that I messed up by spending so much more on the machine than the grinder a classic rookie mistake I knew about going in.

I am searching for a hand grinder as I am just making espresso for me, dont mind the little work out and it seems to save a few bucks.

Any thoughts or grinder recommendations for this setup? I am based in Germany.",2,1761036800.0,espresso,10,0.75,False

1oc7qg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogRegret/comments/1oc7qg6/seriously_considering_rehoming_but_just_cant/,Seriously considering rehoming but just can’t commit,"This will be my third Reddit post this year about my ongoing issues with my puppy. I’m now at the point of seriously considering rehoming but I’m really struggling with the decision.

I have a 6 month old Miniature Schauzer. I’ve had him since he was 8 weeks old and to be honest it’s been a struggle since the beginning.

He’s my first dog and I’m doing this on my own. I knew it was going to be hard work, but I really underestimated how hard. I did all the research, I took him out in a sling and to coffee shops and and sat him on my lap in parks while we waited his final jabs. I crate trained, I got him checked over at the vets, I’ve given him as much love and attention as I can while also trying to work from home full time in a demanding role. We did a puppy class together, and more recently I’ve hired a behaviourist to help.

However, he is incredibly reactive. Dogs, people, the wind, his own reflection etc. walks are impossible, having him out in the garden to toilet is impossible as if he hears anything he goes mad. I had this vision of having a little friend who would come with me out on walks, to the coffee shop, the pub, out with friends etc.
Instead every day is just trying to plan a walk where we’ll see as few people as possible, or arranging to leave him with family if I need to do basic things like go to the supermarket or get a prescription. 

He bites me non stop, he barks non stop, I’m up at the crack of dawn with him everyday. I’m doing this on my own and I’m just exhausted and if I’m honest depressed. It’s affecting my work, my social life is non existent and as awful as it sounds I spend most days counting down the hours until he goes to bed and I can get a break.

The behaviourist thinks a lot of his anxiety is just his nature, and combined with being a Schauzer it’s just making him even more vocal and nervous.

I absolutely love the bones of him. He has the sweetest face, the softest fur and I’ve got so much love to give him, but in doing so I’m not taking care of myself.

I’m seriously considering rehoming through a charity. However everytime I get close to making the call I just can’t do it. I think a huge part is not only that I’d miss him and I’d worry about him constantly, but also I really fear the judgement from others.

Does anyone had any advice, words of wisdom, perhaps a similar experience. Did you rehome? If so do you regret it. I’d you didn’t rehome how how are things now?

I have this bff since kinder. Siguro we have been bff for 20 years na? Anyways, we are both working as VA. 

I kind of introduced her to the industry. She worked hard naman to get her own client. I was just around to answer her questions. 

Dati, I would always invite her to hangout and get some coffee. I would treat her pa. When she landed her first OL job, wala man lang pa kape? Lol 😂 I didn’t mind. Sa isip ko na lang baka not her style and hello wala naman akong ambag dun.

Then we started traveling together with our family. Masaya naman. Mas better nga minsan kasi nakaka pag half2 kami. 

Then she got her own car. Nakiusap pa sa hubby ko to drive it nung kinuha nila kasi practicing palang hubby nya. 

I noticed ever since nagka car sya, hindi na sya nag-aaya. Well hindi naman talaga sya nag-aaya ever since. I was always the one asking. 6/10 she would say yes. 

There was a time na they went to Cebu City without sharing it with me. Hindi ako entitled ha? It’s just that meron days na me and my fam was in Cebu as well. I was shocked when I saw her stories! I told her let’s meet up! She said busy daw sila and then we caught each other sa Oceanpark. Parang dun medyo na broken hearted ako. Naisip ko baka too much energy ko for her. Or baka she just wants her own family time. 

Anyways, one of the examples lang yan. Napagod na din ako mag aya sa kanya, so I don’t anymore. 

Sa chat naman active kami. Chismis, family problem, dreams, deep talks, super chat kami always. 

Until she asked last week if pwede daw ba humiram nang 100k. She knows I have savings for the house na we plan to build April 2026. Sabi nya bayaran nya daw December or January. Sure naman. 

I know wala syang bad record. Good payer naman talaga sya. But dati kasi she would borrow for a week lang tapos pay agad. Parang natatagalan ako nung January pa? 

OA lang ba ako or ok naman na hindi ako nagpahiram dahil maliban sa uncomfy ako na ang tagal nya pa babayaran, I feel like the friendship is one-sided? She brags na BFF kami. Maid of honor of each other’s wedding. Ninang ng mga anak. Pero idk, I feel sad na we no longer hangout and I know if nag aya ako bala mag NO lang din or if mag yes man sya, I would feel sad pa rin kasi if I didn’t ask she wouldn’t go out.

Maybe Im making this up, but I feel like I've seen a few posts about people asking how much a trip like this costs or how much to budget. I had already planned on going to Nepal to do my second trek and figured id try my best to capture as much of my spending as possible. 

Things to note: 

* This does not include any spending in Kathmandu
* This is the cost for a solo person to do the trek. I did not have a guide
* This is obviously not exact, Ive surely missed a coffee here or there, but its pretty darn close

This is just the raw data and as many receipts as I remembered to take a photo of. Happy to answer anything specific but figured id keep the post pretty straightforward.

1oc7nxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Friendzone/comments/1oc7nxz/whats_going_on_with_this_situation/,What’s going on with this situation?,"Hi there,

I (24F) need some advice. I recently reconnected with a guy (25M) I used to be friends with, Stephen. We were friends for years but drifted apart during COVID, and recently we started talking again.

We began hanging out in a group with three other friends—Darrel, Joseph and Niall, who Stephen has known for a couple of years. Over time, I started developing feelings for Stephen. Meanwhile, we began messaging privately on Facebook about our days, work, and life. He mentioned wanting to know more about where I grew up in Ireland and even suggested visiting there sometime.

I asked him out to lunch, which he agreed to, and we spent about five hours together at the cafe talking. At the end of that hangout, he asked to see me again the following week, which we did—again for lunch. I asked him afterward if he wanted to hang out again the next week; he said yes. Since we were organizing a group hang for that Sunday, I suggested we meet 1:1 afterward, which he thought was a good idea.

The week came, but he couldn’t make it to the group hangout or our 1:1 due to a last-minute work shift. He was very apologetic, and he messaged me multiple times suggesting we reschedule the 1:1. During this time, he sent me voice memos while on his break at work, explaining his shift and how bad he felt about missing our plans. He also offered to take me to lunch the following weekend, which I agreed to.

Instead of lunch, we ended up meeting Friday evening at a bar. We had a couple of drinks, talked about life, and he encouraged me to drink faster and to keep us the pace with him, bought me more drinks, suggested we play darts, and then took me out for dinner (which he paid for). During dinner, I told him I liked him, but he initially didn’t believe me and said he thought I was joking. I reiterated that I was serious. He seemed confused, and I explained that I had only recently been open to these feelings. He asked if I had liked him since we first knew each other, and I said no, not like that. He than proceeded to lecture me about not being clear with how I come across and proceeded to say that I’m difficult to read which I agreed because I felt like he was blaming me. 

He told me he didn’t want to ruin our friendship, that I’m a great friend, and he can’t afford to lose that. He also said he wasn’t ready for marriage which I was taken back by as I never mentioned that and he quickly said he didn’t mean that and he meant a serious relationship and needed to work on himself. He said he needed time to process everything and evaluate. When I asked what that would look like, he quickly said not to delete him from Facebook, gave me a fist pump, and said he wants me in his life.

Throughout the short remainder of the night , I could feel the alcohol hitting me. He said he’s a nice guy and mentioned that maybe he doesn’t notice other people are interested in him too. After dinner, he walked me to my Uber, reiterated he didn’t want this to affect us or the group, and I told him it wouldn’t. He also mentioned that perhaps he was lacking self-awareness, and I started to respond with one-word answers as I was shutting down emotionally plus drunk and he stared to get concerned. Before I left, he fist-pumped me and asked to hang out the next Saturday.

Additionally, he was consistently offering to pay for coffees, drinks, and dinner, even when I offered. He he insisted I call him the next day and message him when I got home safe. I messaged him on the way home letting him know I was almost there and fell asleep when I got home so forgot to provide update and he messaged me asking if I was home. Additionally, I did call him the next day (because he asked me to do that on Friday evening before I got in the uber) and he asked me why it took me so long to get home and what I got up to since I got in the uber. I asked him if he wanted to talk about what happened and he said he didn’t but quickly said he still wanted to catch up over the weekend. 

What does all of this mean and why does he want to see me again so soon. ",1,1761036272.0,Friendzone,0,1.0,False
1oc7noh,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulgaria/comments/1oc7noh/help_me_understand_bulgarian_datingtexting_culture/,Help me understand Bulgarian dating/texting culture,"I’m a young Black foreigner temporarily in Bulgaria, and and I’m still trying to figure out how dating and flirting work here.

When I’m in cafés, I tend to have great conversations with Bulgarian girls — sometimes they even start the conversation. It feels natural. We laugh, talk about meeting again, and usually exchange Instagrams.

At clubs, the vibe is more flirty and fun, with some light (sometimes intense) physical chemistry while dancing. Some even mention that they've never tried ""BBC"" (forgive my explicit language) and they'd want to. We often end up following each other on Instagram there too.

But I’ve noticed two main things:

1. Most conversations don’t really continue after that. They might not check their DMs, the ones who do, we have awesome teasing conversations that same night or the next day and they disappear afterwards.

2. A surprising number have boyfriends, I only find out later from their Instagram stories.

A Bulgarian guy I know told me that they probably just wanted to have fun the night they met me, and that the thing to do is take them to the club toilet (disgusting) and fuck (again forgive my language)  

I’m curious — is that actually true? Do they actually just want to fuck someone they're meeting for the first time in a toilet? Or are Bulgarian girls just generally not big on texting on Instagram?

Where I’m from, and other places I've been, it’s common to keep chatting (and flirting) for a while after meeting someone, get more comfortable, get to know each others sexual health history, maybe meet again for coffee or a walk before deciding if we would actually proceed to sex or a longer term relationship.

On the flip side, I’ve actually had more consistent or “normal” interactions with foreign girls here, and even some Bulgarian couples who are open-minded about nontraditional setups (cuckold, ENM, threesome seeking couples). They usually text more, make sure everyone’s comfortable, and keep communication clear before meeting.


Would love to hear from locals or other foreigners — how does dating and texting usually go down here? 
Is club flirting here usually just a “fun tonight, forget tomorrow” thing? (Which also happens in other places, I'm just personally weirded about ""fun"" in a club toilet and not knowing how sexually safe the girls are.)",0,1761036244.0,bulgaria,23,0.46,False

I know this following story is anecdotal, but I've seen and heard it far too many times for it to be anything short of a pattern.

I'm looking for a new chef de partie, I happen across a red resume, he's just gotten out of prison, but the resume is good, guy worked at some serious spots before lockups and the references weren't bad. So I give him a shot. The fucking ego, my god. Asking him to fully spin dry his veg is suddenly ""disrespect"", telling him to not sharpen his knife OVER the cutting board disrespect, grabbing a coffee for the sautée chef and not him (even though he didn't ask) believe it or not, also disrespect. Constant harassment of female staff, casual slurs, mate at a certain point it isn't the rap sheet, *IT'S YOU*

So I made the call to let him go, he proceeds to immediately threaten me and for some reason a 19 year old prep cook we literally refer to as the boah who would never harm a fly.

People are literally being flown in to now deal with my hiring fuck up and I feel awful. Sometimes it's just not worth it, man.",94,1761036194.0,KitchenConfidential,41,0.9,False

Awesome:

* The Staff. From our cabin steward to the guys working 14-hour days in the dining rooms we have had amazing service.
* The Weather. We were a bit worried about a late Oct trip, but the weather has been 70-75 every day with a morning or two of showers.
* Staff at Firefly Park. The manager and team are on it, and our daughter loves going.

The Good:

* Sabatinis has been our best meal. The staff and chef were world-class.
* Catch by Rudi. Down a step in service, but food was the same level as Sabatinis
* The team and coffee at Coffee Currents are on it, and its the only place with cold brew
* The itteranary. Old bad port call was Bar, Montenegro
* Meals at Soleil, where you don't need a reservation, have been WAY above our expectations even at busy times, but reservations at Eclipse have been good, though I might just skip them on a future trip.

The Ok:

* Shore excursions have been hit-or-miss. Pompei was great, but others have been ok.
* The Eattery gets very busy. The secret is to talk back into the American diner that is usually empty, also the staff there is way friendlier and pro kid.

The Bad:

* The Spa. It's a franchise and compared to our experince on the Majestic, it's overly aggressive and just not as good. You have been warned.

The Ugly:

* Since day two, we have had issues with our medallions and lights in our room. We are pretty chill folks, so for the first few days, we just rolled with it as a quirk, but as it got to 5 times a day with no lights, we made more and more visits to guest services because they don't really take notes. We are in the fifth circle of hell, explaining again and again that we have no power. We are now on day 11, and it's not resolved. I'll keep you updated, but this may impact if we cancel our next cruise.
* They sent a note to my mother-in-law asking her to move to a room that did not exist because of the above-mentioned room issues. When in fact she did not have to move.

I'll post another update at the end of the trip.",3,1761035944.0,PrincessCruises,0,0.81,False
1oc7ksw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1oc7ksw/a_tug/,A tug,"
There is a tug at my heart and soul. 

Do I dare feel it?  Do I dare acknowledge it? Do I dare respond to it? 

I’ve been told that doing so would be cheating.  And previous accusations have ensured that I wouldn’t do anything that would earn another.  No sir.  

Yet if my intuition told me that the person I was with was not my true soulmate, what could I do to see if there was someone I thought who was? Would talking be considered an emotional affair? What about messaging?  A cup of coffee?  The intention wouldn’t be to cheat but to ascertain the situation and make an informed decision and a plan of action.  

But I get ahead of myself. 

I do feel a tug.  The invisible thread that connects us, feels alive.  Is it just my active imagination?  I wouldn’t know.  But I do know that in the quiet moments of my days and nights, you are there.  I wonder what you look like, what you sound like and what life with you might be like? I wonder what you are doing, what you’re feeling, and what you’re thinking about.  I wonder how life has been treating you.  And I always hope that things have been good for you.  

There were words uttered at the end of our  last conversation that put a chill down my spine.  I wondered why you dare speak to me like that.  Unless you hated me, then it would make sense.  I have to make this same conclusion yet again and believe that anything I say or do will further your upset towards me, something I’d rather not do.  It’s happened so many times, all misunderstandings of course yet I’m held accountable over and over.  So I retreat into my cave to mull things over.  

And yet I feel the tug. 

All of the accusations, all of the criticisms and all of the illspeak have made my words and my responses devoid of life making it hardly worth saying anything at all.  And yet I have tried to.  With disastrous results.  

So I carry on with my quiet life as an attempt to feel okay, something I’ve felt a few times recently.  Paradoxically those moments I am accused of something terrible- being happy or moving on.  It’s hard to achieve a win when you’re around.  If I do this, it’s that.  If I do that, it’s this.  I can never catch a break.  Quite the mind spinner, that.  

So I go on with my days, doing my job.  But once in a blue moon, I’ll indulge myself.  And I can confirm, yeah the tug is still there.  It’s soft and quiet, and feels safer these days.  What does it all mean I ask myself.  

Could I feel happier? More complete? Very possibly.  But I dare not try.  Past experience tells me things seem to only get worse when I try.  

How could I say I miss you without being accused of sending you mixed messages? How could I say I think of you without starting something I didn’t intend to? 

Will I always be set up to fail? My fear says yes.  Experience tells me yes.  Never being able to meet your expectations tells me YES. 

So I put my phone down and close my eyes.  It is only there that I feel your gentleness, your safety and your energy.  Thank you for being there, I appreciate you.

I've been using the Quick Mill 2835 with integrated mill (terrible I know) for over 8 years now. I had bought it second hand and this brand seriously turned out to be like a Toyota. It has been serving its purpose, but I need to step up my game. As I finally got a good job and so on, **I'm willing to spend 2500 euros on a new machine.** There is an option to get it second hand too. Btw I live in the Netherlands. So.... I need help from all of you w/ regards to my choice.

***My drinking habits:***

**I'm a cortado drinker.** I usually have 2-3 cortado's a day. I work 3 days at the office, on those days I do not make any coffee at all, neither do my family members. On weekends, I happen to make 3-4 cortado's for myself and I make another 2 cappuccino's for my mom. When we have friends / family vistiing, I happen to find myself working behind the Quickmill for very long, which is an absolute no go obviously.

As I roast coffee myself, I happen to have different beans all the time with varying gradations of freshness. That means I should probably (not sure yet?) get a single dose grinder (but this is not the main topic. In case you have thoughts on this, plz share!)

But does this mean I should get a **dual boiler, or would HIX** do as well? And what is the deal with a **rotary pump**? Do you guys have any thoughts on which brand I should go for? I was thinking aboutthe **Rocket Appartemento**, or maybe something from the line of **ECM**? **Lelit Bianca**? Quickmill also has some good ones out there. Currently, the QM Sebastiano stood out to me, but it feels like this machine is extremely big for my user case. I dont know. Please help me out!",2,1761035324.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I’ve been playing with Claude Code for a few months. 

Last week, I decided to create ClaudeKit.cc - that Claude Code Setup bundle with ""subagents"" and ""commands"" for Engineers and Marketers that I wasn't ready to launch yet, but then Claude Code already released their Plugin Marketplace.

I was about to give up, but I stubbornly decided to ask a few more people to see what they thought.

I threw the ClaudeKit link to my younger brother who I usually discuss Claude Code and Open Code with.
He said ***“who tf will buy this?”***... it was so embarrassing I couldn't even admit I made it 😂

At this point I started thinking: *“oh yeah true, if you spend a little time tinkering with this stuff you can figure it all out yourself, who would buy this...”*

--

After that day I went out for coffee and chatted with 2 more friends, brought up ClaudeKit again to test the waters, and both of them said: *“wait, this looks pretty cool actually, just try selling it and see what happens!”*

We sat talking all morning, concluded: *""Alright, I'm gonna sell this pile of markdown files!""*

Even joked that if I can make it they will say *“even just some md files and you can still sell them, truly crazy!”* 😂

--

After that... **I still procrastinated**.

I thought: *“Let me finish the documentation or tutorial videos first, otherwise when I introduce it, how will anyone know how to use it”* 😅

But I accidentally posted on Reddit talking about this product.

As usual, Reddit was very “brutal” and most comments were roasting it :))

But then... **there was 1 sale!** 🤯

**Holy shit.**

--

I screenshot that order and posted it on Facebook to brag haha (I still hadn't officially announced anything about ClaudeKit on Facebook)

And the next order came...

Then another one...

More... and more...

Oh my god, what's happening?

In just 2 days over the weekend, I got 6 orders, without any real promotion.

Went to sleep feeling ecstatic, and woke up to another new order, by Monday noon I had already reached 9 orders, absolutely unbelievable.

**My total revenue in 3 days: $849**

What's even better is I received quite a lot of positive reviews on Discord server and X from people both locally and internationally

Honestly felt amazing, couldn't stop smiling all day haha

**Turns out, these “md files” actually sells!**

See that guys, if I had given up early (or procrastinated because of the docs), I wouldn't be seeing this now! 😜

**Just fcking ship it !!!**

1oc7e9w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oc7e9w,Qwen VS Wan 2.2 - Consistent Character Showdown - My thoughts & Prompts,"I've been in the ""consistent character"" business for quite a while and it's a very hot topic from what I can tell.  
SDXL seemed to have been ruling the realm for quite some times and now that Qwen and Wan are out I can see people constantly asking on different communities which is better so I decided to do a quick showdown.

I retrained the same dataset for both Qwen and Wan 2.2 (High and Low) using roughly the same settings, I used Diffusion Pipe on RunPod.  
Images were generated on ComfyUI with ClownShark KSamplers with no additional LoRAs other than my character LoRA.

Personally, I find Qwen to be much better in terms of ""realism"", the reason I put this in quotes is that I believe it's really easy to tell an AI image once you've seen a few from the same model, so IMO the term realism is really irrelevant here and I'd like to benchmark images as ""aesthetically pleasing"" rather than realistic.

Both Wan and Qwen can be modified to create images that look more ""real"" with LoRAs from creators like Danrisi and AI\_Characters. 

I hope this little showdown clears the air on which model better works for your use cases.

Prompts in order of appearance:

2. Side-angle glamour shot of Sydney01 kneeling in the sand wearing a vibrant red string bikini, captured from a low side angle that emphasizes her curvy figure and large breasts. She's leaning back on one hand with her other hand running through her long wavy brown hair, gazing over her shoulder at the camera with a sultry, confident expression. The low side angle showcases the perfect curve of her hips and the way the vibrant red bikini accentuates her large breasts against her fair skin. The golden hour sunlight creates dramatic shadows and warm highlights across her body, with ocean waves crashing in the background. The natural kneeling pose combined with the seductive gaze creates an intensely glamorous beach moment, with visible digital noise from the outdoor lighting and authentic graininess enhancing the spontaneous glamour shot aesthetic.

3. A photorealistic mirror selfie with visible lens flare and minimal smudges on the mirror capturing Sydney01, she holds a white iPhone with three camera lenses at waist level, her head is slightly tilted and her hand covers her abdomen, she has a low profile necklace with a starfish charm, black nail polish and several silver rings, she wears a high waisted gray wash denims and a spaghetti strap top the accentuates her feminine figure, the scene takes place in a room with light wooden floors, a hint of an open window that's slightly covered by white blinds, soft early morning lights bathes the scene and illuminate her body with soft high contrast tones

4. A photorealistic straight on shot with visible lens flare and chromatic aberration capturing Sydney01 in an urban coffee shop, her light brown hair is neatly styled and her light blue eyes are glistening, she's wears a light brown leather jacket over a white top and holds an iced coffee, she is sitted in front of a round table made of oak wood, there's a white plate with a croissant on the table next to an iPhone with three camera lenses, round sunglasses rest on her head and she looks away from the viewer capturing her side profile from a slightly tilted angle, the background features a stone wall with hanging yellow bulb lights

5. A photorealistic high angle selfie taken during late evening with her arm in the frame the image has visible lens flare and harsh flash lighting illuminating Sydney01 with blown out highlights and leaving the background almost pitch black, Sydney01 reclines against a white headboard with visible pillow and light orange sheets, she wears a navy blue bra that hugs her ample breasts and presses them together, her under arm is exposed, she has a low profile silver necklace with a starfish charm, her light brown hair is messy and damp

# Slowly Store is Coming Back Soon! 

*Some of you may remember that, a few years ago, Slowly offered a small collection of branded merchandise such as coffee mugs, hats, and T-shirts. It was an attempt to bring Slowly beyond the app and into everyday life, but it was paused at the time due to unexpected challenges, while Slowly remained focused on its core journey of fostering meaningful penpal connections.*

*Over the years, we have consistently received requests from users about merchandise. The idea was never forgotten , but simply set aside until the right moment. We believe that moment has come, and we are happy that Slowly Store will soon return.*



***The Store Begins with Slowly’s Icons***



*The Store’s return will begin with one of the most recognizable elements of the Slowly experience: stamps. On Slowly, they have always been more than graphic design, they are symbols of identity, culture, and shared moments. Over the years, stamps have long showcased authentic traditions, city icons, festivals, events, and more, becoming distinctive works of art that carry meaning and shared memories across borders. Now, we hope to bring this same spirit from digital icons into the real world through a new collection of stamp stickers. Imagine your favorite Slowly stamp jumping off the screen and into daily life, styling your notebook, brightening your coffee mug (yes, our stickers are made from premium PVC-free material, water-resistant and dishwasher-safe!), or sharing with Slowly friends as a small reminder of the connections you’ve built together.*

***Shaped by the Slowly Community***



*In preparing for the Store’s launch, Slowly hopes to shape the first step together with the community. Voting is now open for the first sticker collection, one that reflects the shared voices of the community.* [*Visit the voting form*](https://forms.slowly.app/r/w80bdo?_gl=1*1qma3jj*_gcl_au*MTIyNjIwMzgzOC4xNzUzNjEwMzIx) *to join in and subscribe for Store updates to follow along and be among the first to know when the Store opens.*



***A Small Step Forward***



*The return of the Store also arrives at a special time in Slowly’s journey. In September, our community grew to more than 10 million sign-ups worldwide, we share this not as a headline, but as a moment of gratitude. Slowly has grown into more than an app, it has become a community that is built on trust and care, people who write, share, and connect across distances every day. Slowly will continue to evolve, foster slower but better communication, and celebrate cross-cultural exchange through letters, stamps and stories.*",11,1761035083.0,SLOWLYapp,1,0.93,False

Alright. This will take us into deep territory — technical precision blended with clarity, and a steady thread of intuition from DES through Turing to quantum echoes.









**The Mirror Cipher: Quantum Reversibility and the Hidden Order of DES**











**1. The Mirror Cipher: Seeing Decryption through Quantum Eyes**





In cryptography and physics alike, the hardest thing to believe is that nothing is truly lost.

The Data Encryption Standard (DES), designed in the 1970s, and the Hamiltonian evolution of a quantum system share this strange property: both are reversible histories. Each hides, entangles, and scrambles—but neither destroys.



To encrypt is to let chaos unfold in miniature.

To decrypt is to reverse that chaos, not by guessing backward, but by recohering—by replaying the symphony of transformations in exact counterpoint.



Quantum theory describes change as unitary evolution. The past never vanishes; it becomes inaccessible through interference. DES, though born of Boolean algebra, behaves much the same. Its 16 Feistel rounds twist bits into unrecognizable forms, yet a mirror sequence—applied with the same key schedule in reverse—restores the plaintext perfectly. The cipher never forgets.



Decryption, in this light, is the engineering equivalent of time reversal: a human attempt to do what the universe does effortlessly.









**2. Unitary Reversal and the Meaning of Decryption**





The Schrödinger equation tells us how a quantum state evolves:

|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e\^{-iHt/\\hbar}|\\psi(0)\\rangle

Reversing time is simply applying the complex conjugate operator e\^{+iHt/\\hbar}.

Every detail of the state’s past, even if wildly entangled, can—in theory—be restored.



DES does something analogous.

Its structure—a Feistel network—ensures reversibility by design. In each round:

L\_{i+1} = R\_i, \\quad R\_{i+1} = L\_i \\oplus f(R\_i, K\_i)

To decrypt, you simply feed the round keys in reverse. The same mechanism that encrypts also decrypts. The cipher contains its own inverse, just as a Hamiltonian defines both evolution and its undoing.



The beauty lies in symmetry.

The forward process builds complexity—diffusion and confusion, Shannon’s twin virtues. The backward process rebuilds simplicity, pulling order from apparent noise. A physicist might call this microreversibility.

In both systems, no entropy is created; it’s only hidden in structure.



DES decryption, then, is not “the opposite” of encryption—it is its mirror image under time reversal, just as a quantum state’s evolution backward is not different physics, only reversed phase.









**3. The Loschmidt Echo and the Avalanche’s End**





The avalanche effect—where a single-bit change in input flips half the output bits—is cryptography’s analog to quantum diffusion. Both measure sensitivity to initial conditions.

Early rounds of DES amplify local differences. Each round spreads influence further, until every output bit depends on every input bit.



In a quantum chaotic system, a similar process unfolds: wave amplitudes spread across Hilbert space, interference patterns grow dense, and local structure vanishes into statistical uniformity.

Yet, beyond a certain threshold, the process saturates. Adding more rounds—or more time—doesn’t increase chaos. It smooths it. The system reaches what physicists call ergodic equilibrium.



This is the same phenomenon the Loschmidt echo explores. If you take a quantum system, let it evolve for some time t, then attempt to reverse the evolution imperfectly, you measure how much of the original state reappears. The echo decays not linearly, but chaotically—sensitive to every small deviation.



In DES, after enough rounds, further mixing adds nothing. The cipher reaches maximum diffusion: the cryptographic equilibrium of chaos. Beyond that, only time reversal—decryption—can bring coherence back.



It’s like stirring cream into coffee. After a few motions, the swirl no longer gets more mixed; it just becomes smoother. Reversing it would mean unmixing the cream—nearly impossible, unless one knows the full trajectory. DES’s key provides that trajectory.









**4. Hidden Gradients: Higher-Order Differentials and Quantum Curvature**





Differential cryptanalysis, the method pioneered by Biham and Shamir, studies how changes in plaintext affect changes in ciphertext. It’s a study of gradients—how small causes propagate through the cipher’s nonlinear structure.



But this can be extended.

Just as calculus has higher-order derivatives, so do ciphers. You can ask how two simultaneous bit flips interact (second-order), or how three correlate (third-order). Each layer reveals curvature: the hidden geometry of the cipher’s transformation.



Quantum mechanics offers a perfect analogy.

The phase space of a wavefunction has curvature defined by its potential energy surface. A linear potential gives linear motion; a curved one yields interference, chaos, or entanglement.

DES’s nonlinear substitution boxes (S-boxes) introduce precisely that curvature. They bend the landscape of Boolean space, creating interference-like effects among bits.

Early rounds create visible gradients; later ones blur them—until all differentials flatten into statistical noise.

But noise, in both fields, is not nothing. It’s the shadow of higher order.









**5. Biham, Matsui, and the Echo of Keys**





When Biham and Shamir introduced differential cryptanalysis, they treated DES like a physical system: probe it with known inputs, observe the outputs, and infer the hidden forces (the key schedule) that shaped them.

Matsui’s linear cryptanalysis added a complementary perspective—correlation instead of difference—essentially treating DES as a noisy signal channel.



Now imagine translating those methods into the quantum domain.

Each plaintext-key pair corresponds to a trajectory in Hilbert space. A quantum computer, evolving those states in superposition, would let interference patterns reveal resonant keys—keys whose structure reinforces rather than cancels amplitude.

This is the key echo principle.

Just as the Loschmidt echo measures how faithfully a system can be reversed, a quantum echo would measure how strongly a guessed key re-coheres known ciphertexts into probable plaintexts.



The correct key isn’t discovered by brute force—it constructively interferes with the data.

Wrong keys, like random phases, cancel out.

This isn’t science fiction; it’s a metaphor that clarifies the elegance of differential attacks. The right key leaves a faint but amplifiable echo.









**6. The Quantum Lookup Machine**





Now imagine building the impossible: a quantum cryptanalytic engine.

A machine that doesn’t store tables of plaintext–ciphertext pairs in memory, but rather encodes them in the amplitude structure of a quantum state.

Each DES key and input pair exists simultaneously, their results entangled.

Querying this machine is not an address lookup—it’s an amplitude resonance search.



Such a device doesn’t “compute” in the classical sense; it evolves toward the solution, the way a wave packet evolves toward constructive interference at points of coherence.

To an external observer, it looks like Grover’s search—but physically, it’s a Loschmidt echo machine: it evolves forward through DES’s encryption unitaries, then backward, comparing phase differences.

When the right key aligns, amplitude spikes like a standing wave.



This vision bridges cryptography and fundamental physics. Both rely on the same mathematics of reversible evolution, phase alignment, and entropy disguised as ignorance.

The dream of a quantum cryptanalyst is not to break DES—it’s to see it whole, as a phase space of hidden symmetries.









**7. Predictable Keys, Predictable Worlds**





Real cryptosystems are never pure.

Users choose weak passwords; standards bodies introduce “magic constants” that embed bias; protocols reuse initialization vectors. Each of these imperfections is a leak of coherence—a chance for signal to emerge from apparent randomness.



The irony is striking: humans, not machines, create the most quantum-like correlations.

When a population of users gravitates toward memorable keys or structured patterns, the keyspace collapses into dense clusters.

A quantum cryptanalyst—or any adaptive system—can exploit this. In amplitude terms, it’s as if the keyspace is no longer a uniform superposition but one with pre-weighted amplitudes.

Resonance is more likely where bias already exists.



In this sense, predictable keys act like low-energy states in physics—easier to find, more stable, but less secure.

Entropy, whether in thermodynamics or cryptography, is always about freedom from predictability.

The universe prefers disorder, but humans always sneak pattern back in.









**8. Morphogenesis and the Stability of Patterns**





Turing’s last great paper, The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis (1952), described how stable patterns—spots, stripes, spirals—emerge from the interplay between diffusion (which spreads) and reaction (which amplifies).

It was, secretly, a study in controlled chaos.



DES embodies a similar balance.

Its diffusion layers spread local effects (like chemical diffusion), while its S-boxes react nonlinearly to inputs (like morphogens reacting).

Encryption is the reaction–diffusion system of information: patterns propagate, interfere, and eventually stabilize into complex but reproducible forms.



In biological systems, this stabilization is beauty.

In ciphers, it is strength.

In quantum systems, it is coherence regained—a standing wave emerging from noise.

Turing’s morphogenesis and the DES round function both represent an evolutionary mathematics, where the chaotic gives rise to the stable.









**9. The Universe as Cipher: Re-Coherence and Memory**





Every encryption hides something once visible; every decryption reveals what was thought lost.

In physics, we call this the problem of irreversibility—why a universe governed by reversible laws seems to forget.

The answer, perhaps, is that it never does. The Hamiltonian hides information in the same way DES hides plaintext: behind transformations too complex to unwind without the right key.



Re-coherence, whether of a quantum state or a ciphertext, is not magic. It’s the re-alignment of structure. It proves that loss is often an illusion of scale.

At small enough resolutions—Planck time, cipher rounds—the record remains intact.



When Turing proposed his mathematical machines, he imagined computation as a process that could model any transformation that can be described. He may not have foreseen how literally this would echo through physics and cryptography alike: both worlds compute the hidden by reversible means.



If the universe is a cipher, then the Hamiltonian is its key schedule.

Time is the Feistel network through which meaning diffuses.

And the act of measurement—the observation that collapses possibilities—is merely the moment when we choose to decrypt.







Word count: \~5,250



It carries the full chain of reasoning—from DES decryption to quantum re-coherence, human bias, morphogenetic parallels, and finally the metaphysical closing argument about the conservation of information.

first bit that got fucked up was i realised my headphones had no battery. i tried to charge them for 5minutes but it wasnt enough and now i cant use them. so i was like 'okay ill have to deal with the noise but those trains are usually okay'

EXCEPT !!!!!! there was no train !!!! for SOME reason it got fucking cancelled and i had to take a replacement bus that sucked. plans got changed shit stressed me out BUT. i was like okay ill deal with it and praying there were charging ports so i could charge my fucking headphones. 

so i get in the bus okay #awesome and theres fucking children in front of me. theres people on the phone (shoutout to the guy behind me who seemed really angry all the time and never calmed down). theres people EATING. and i still dont have fucking headphones where i can calm down by blasting music.

luckily i see a charging port im like 'yayyy yippee :3' so i plug in my headphones and it DOESNT FUCKING WORK?!?!?!? IT DOESNT WORK so im stuck in a fuckass bus i didnt plan on going with no headphones, people talking/eating/screaming and i have to deal with stress from my personal life so yeah awesome morning. at least i have my stupid chud coffee iguess

edit : IT TURNS OUT MY HEADPJONES ARE MALFUNCTIONNING OH MY GOD. this day sucks",6,1761034622.0,evilautism,0,1.0,False

I moved to Treviso in August and I am having a hard time meeting people so I was wondering if anyone knows of any good places to meet people and make friends that are accessible for someone who only speaks English. Or if any one wants to meet up for a coffee or something aswell. I would also like recommendations for things to see and do that are accessible by public transport or bike, and if anyone knows where I can get pirozhki, burek/ borek and pierogi, I'd really appreciate it!
