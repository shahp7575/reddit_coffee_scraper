The thing is that I feel discriminated by my mil (f70). We are from the same ethnicity, I think that‚Äôs important. So I‚Äôm venting bc today I was washing my slippers, a carpet and a jacket in the same load, she saw this and started scolding me not to do it bc she needed to wash clothes (she was asleep when I started and I was almost finished when she found out) I know it‚Äôs her house but she has told me in the past to just take out whatever is in the washer and do my thing. Plus she washes everybody‚Äôs muddy shoes in it too. In the past she‚Äôs made it seem like I myself am dirty or something, she has made comments about me putting my feet in the couch and that I would get her pillows dirty (everybody lay down to watch tv) or even approach her coffee. Another thing that gets on my nerves is that when she gives me food, is that she gives me what no one else wants and even makes jokes about how I‚Äôll finish my husband‚Äôs leftovers, I know it‚Äôs not her obligation to feed me, but I also don‚Äôt ask her for it, I mostly eat it to keep the peace.My sil‚Äôs ex bf is white and did nasty things to her but somehow he immediately got a better treatment after he did all that.

She also gets like this when something wrong happens in her life and I‚Äôm starting to think she sees me like her punching bag. I‚Äôve packed my things in the past bc we used to fight a lot, as I was packing my stuff to leave she came to ask me not to leave, which makes it even more confusing. I‚Äôm thinking of leasing a room, since my parents live nowhere near close. I don‚Äôt think my husband will want to come immediately, and I am scared this will shatter our marriage, but I‚Äôm getting tired honestly.

--------------------------------------------------------

Creating your own natural pesticides and fertilizers can be a rewarding endeavor that benefits both your garden and the environment. By using everyday ingredients, you can produce effective solutions to nourish your plants and control pests while avoiding harmful chemicals. Here‚Äôs how you can easily make them yourself.

### Natural Fertilizers

Natural fertilizers improve soil health and provide nutrients for plants. Here are some easy recipes you can try:

#### Compost

Composting is a fantastic way to recycle kitchen scraps and yard waste. To make compost:

- Gather materials like fruit and vegetable peelings, coffee grounds, eggshells, and dry leaves.
- Layer them in a bin or pile, alternating between green materials (high in nitrogen) and brown materials (high in carbon).
- Turn the compost every couple of weeks to aerate it and speed up decomposition.
- In a few months, you‚Äôll have rich compost to add to your garden.
 
#### Banana Peel Fertilizer

Banana peels are rich in potassium, which promotes flowering and fruiting. You can use them in a couple of ways:

- Simply chop banana peels into small pieces and bury them in your plant's soil.
- Alternatively, soak peels in water for a few days, then use that water to fertilize your plants.
 
### Natural Pesticides

To keep pesky insects away, try making your own natural pesticides. Here are some effective recipes:

#### Soap Spray

Soap spray is excellent at targeting soft-bodied insects like aphids and spider mites. To create this solution:

- Dilute 1-2 tablespoons of liquid soap (not detergent) in a quart of water.
- Spray directly on affected plants, ensuring you cover both sides of the leaves.
- Reapply every few days until the pests are gone.
 
#### Pepper Spray

Pepper spray deters many insects due to its strong scent and flavor. Here‚Äôs how to make it:

- Blend a handful of hot peppers (like cayenne) with water.
- Strain the mixture to remove solid bits, and add a few drops of soap to help it stick.
- Spray on plants as needed, but avoid getting it on your skin or in your eyes.
 
### Garlic Spray

Garlic has natural insect-repelling properties. To make garlic spray:

- Crush 2-3 cloves of garlic and mix with water in a spray bottle.
- Allow the mixture to sit overnight for maximum potency.
- Strain and spray on plants to keep pests away.
 
### Direct Tips for Success

For the best results when making and applying your natural pesticides and fertilizers, consider the following tips:

 Check out the blog for more information https://griddownguide.com/how-do-i-make-my-own-natural-pesticides-and-fertilizers/  
  
- Test a small area of the plant before full application to ensure it doesn‚Äôt cause damage.
- Apply your natural solutions in the early morning or late evening to avoid sunburn on plants.
- Store any leftover solutions in a cool, dark place and label them clearly.
- Be patient and consistent with applications; natural remedies often take longer to show results than commercial products.
 
By making your own natural pesticides and fertilizers, you not only save money but also contribute to a healthier ecosystem. It involves a learning process, but the rewards of lush plants and a thriving garden are well worth the effort. Dive into your garden with these practical recipes, customize them as needed, and enjoy the satisfaction of nurturing your plants naturally!

The Benefits of Using Organic Solutions for Sustainable Gardening
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Gardening is a rewarding activity that not only beautifies your surroundings but also provides fresh produce. When it comes to gardening, opting for organic solutions is a choice that goes beyond just what you see in your garden. It can lead to numerous benefits that positively impact both the environment and your health. Here‚Äôs why you should consider organic solutions for your gardening needs.

### Enhances Soil Health

Organic gardening focuses on nurturing the soil, which is crucial for growing healthy plants. Here are some ways organic solutions contribute to soil health:

- **Improved Soil Structure:** Organic matter, such as compost, enhances soil texture, enabling better drainage and air circulation.
- **Increased Nutrient Content:** Organic fertilizers release nutrients slowly, providing a consistent feed for plants over time.
- **Microbial Activity:** Organic practices promote beneficial microorganisms in the soil, essential for nutrient absorption.

### Environmentally Friendly Practices

Using organic solutions helps reduce the impact on ecosystems. This includes:

- **Minimized Chemical Runoff:** Organic gardening avoids synthetic chemicals, which can pollute water sources and harm aquatic life.
- **Supports Biodiversity:** Organic practices promote natural pest predators, such as ladybugs, contributing to a balanced ecosystem.
- **Reduced Carbon Footprint:** Growing your own food with organic methods lowers the need for transportation and packaging, which helps cut down on greenhouse gas emissions.

### Healthier Produce

The food you grow can have a significant impact on your health. Organic gardening leads to:

- **No Harmful Chemicals:** Organic fruits and vegetables are free from synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, resulting in safer food options.
- **Higher Nutrient Levels:** Research suggests that organically grown produce may contain higher levels of vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals.
- **Better Flavor:** Many gardeners claim that organic produce tastes fresher and more flavorful, adding joy to your meals.

### Cost-Effective Practices

While organic gardening may seem more expensive at first, it offers long-term cost benefits:

- **Reduces Dependency on Store-Bought Chemicals:** By creating your own natural fertilizers and pest repellents, you save money on expensive chemicals.
- **High Yield Returns:** Healthy soil leads to robust plants, which often produce more fruits and vegetables, maximizing your investment.
- **Less Waste:** Organic gardening encourages composting, turning kitchen scraps and garden waste into valuable soil amendments.

### Empowers You as a Gardener

Organic gardening empowers you by involving you in the entire growing process. The knowledge gained through this practice includes:

- **Understanding Plant Needs:** You learn to recognize what your plants require for optimal growth.
- **Skill Development:** Developing skills in composting, natural pest control, and crop rotation boosts your confidence.
- **Contributing to Sustainability:** By using organic practices, you play a role in fostering a sustainable environment for future generations.

### Promoting Sustainability

Organic solutions in your gardening efforts promotes sustainability on multiple levels:

- **Water Conservation:** Organic practices, such as mulching, reduce water evaporation and help retain moisture, benefiting your plants.
- **Long-Term Productivity:** Organic gardening methods prioritize regenerative practices that sustain the land for years to come.
- **Adds to the Local Economy:** Purchasing organic seeds and plants from local growers helps support your community.

Transitioning to organic solutions in your garden offers numerous advantages that reflect positively on both your health and the surrounding environment. By choosing organic, you create a sustainable garden that benefits not just you, but also the planet.

### Conclusion

Creating your own natural pesticides and fertilizers is an empowering step towards a healthier garden and environment. By utilizing readily available ingredients from your kitchen or garden, you can effectively manage pests and nourish your plants without the harmful effects of synthetic chemicals. Simple recipes like neem oil sprays, garlic insect repellents, and compost teas ensure that your garden thrives while keeping it safe for your family, pets, and beneficial insects.

fast foward when i broke up with her last year we went to a rave, we went together with her friends i was gonna take her home and she said ""my friends are going to leave me at my house"" which i knew it was bullshit  and she ended up going to another party without me then 15 mins later she kissed another girl for a selfie and i got pissed and broke up with her. then instantly gaslighting me through text. we stopped talking for like 2 weeks and she started messaging me and we started to reconnected we went to another rave ""before we actually started talking about getting back together) and she kissed another girl infront of me got pissed left her there. next day i had to apologize for leaving her there and we agreed to have an opened relashionship. tbh i only agreed cause i didnt want to lose her. my only condition was that i didnt want her to do anythign with someone else infront of me. which fastfoward to 6 months later i went to pick her up for a date she told me be here at 8 and she was making out with some dude infront of her house, i dumped her again. she sent me romantic video like 2 weeks later on my birthday fell for it and we started going out again. she apologize and said the guy she was making out here followed her home and insisted and i know her, and i know if she doesnt want to she doesnt let anyone do that, so i figured she did it on purpose, SHE never takes accontability for anything, never said my fault  only blamed the guy, so we got back together more serious and became a couple,

thats when the real trouble start thats where i want to know if it really was my fault because she kept saying i didn't appreciate her and i was lucky to have her. she also said to unfollow every girl on instagram because why are you following them. she looked through my phone, her phone was always on do not disturbed when she was with me, her ex (her baby daddy) would somtimes spend the night at her house because of her daughter which she always said stop being jealous, she asked for my live location on whatsapp alot because she didnt trust when i never gave her reasons to do so, she yelled at me and got angry for every little thing, like once i sent her my location instead of live location by accident and she went off. so this weekend she went to a rave with her friends which she originally invited me to then univted me for some reasons which was suspicious to me and she told me to pick her up at 4am after it was done, i went out that night with some friends and she got mad because i didnt send live location the whole night, when she was ready to go home she said ""babe im going to sleep over at my friends house. so i was like okey i trust you, and then 2 hours later she was spamming my phone to come pick her up, i didnt pick up because it was 4am and i was asleep and she got so mad, because she said if you love someone you always thinking about them and theres no way i didnt pick up at 4-5 am (note also some things she got mad over which is the part where i want to ask you guys if it was really my fault) i would sometimes not answer my phone when i was watching tv or playing games, and she got mad because she thinks i didnt care about her, and what if it was an emergecy she cant count on me. when im not the type of person thats always on the phone, max i would answer her back like after 20 mins.

so tonight we broke up, i went pick her up to go get some coffee and she was already mad when i picked her up because i didnt pick her up from the rave at 4 am the day earlier, so we went to get some donuts i parked in the wrong spot by accident and thats when she went off completely i even got so scared she started saying if its not one thing its another thing with you, you're a narcist and dont care about peoples feelings she started calling me a dumbass a fucking idiot, to take her back to my house, and to this point i was so done, so i took her back to her house, before we got there she said let me get out here to get some donuts for my daughter so i went back, and thats where i parked the car so she could go out and she completely went off even harder, i started telling her to look how you are behaving then she started saying ""there you go again acting like a victim if i dont scream then you dont know im hurting""(she said this soooo loud all the neighbours came outside to check, she got out of the car, took a bottle of beer for 1 gallon smashed it on the floor as hard as she could (her 3 year old daughter was in the back seat the whole time she was going off) slammed my car door insanely hard took her daughter and left, and i was just in shock at what i just witnessed the neighbours thought i hit her or something so i left. i go home and she calls me tell her she forgot her baby towels. when i get home she started going off saying youre not gonna find someone better than me i can't belive how many times i told you to treat me right and to pick up your phone blah blah i never want to see you again. and i told her ""i could say alot of things but im not going too i hope you realize all i did for you(I PAID FOR EVERYTHING LITERALLY FOR EVERYTHING, trips concerts, her groseries, presents, everytime we went out i paid) i will always love you but i cant anymore i really wish you luck, im not gonna block you incase you need anything. so another note she does drugs, she smokes weed everyday and also does other hard drugs sometimes. she has mental issues i offered to pay for her therapy but she kept postponing it.

and this is where i went to know am i really to blame for this?  all this time i kept thinking she was a narcists now im not sure if its really my fault, for being ""uninterested"" as she said when i gave her all the attention she was my everything i just wasnt on the phone all the time. i already miss her and its only been a couple of hours and i worry about her so much, because i know she is unstable, takes drugs and drinks a lot. Im afraid she will end up in trouble but i cant do it anymore, we talked about living together. all the plans . but i feel she treats me worse than dirt. i left some stuff so it wouldnt be too long but i would really love your feedback redditors im going insane for falling in love so hard with someone younger than me",1,1734327146.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I am in the initial stages of planning my trip and doing reserach. I have no big plans in Vietnam, I just want to have coffee there, walk around the city esp. see the ho chi minh mausoleum (my airbnb will be 100 meters away!), and hopefully get a hike in possibly in sapa or ninh binh? Now I would like advice please on this itinerary from people who have done similar things:

* Day 1 - 8AM arrival in Hanoi, full day of exploring--going to mausoleum, parks, getting food
* Day 2 - 3 - Either this [Sapa Klook activity](https://www.klook.com/en-PH/activity/10541-2d1n-sapa-tour-hotel-accommodation-hanoi-halong-bay/?spm=SearchResult.SearchResult_LIST&clickId=4c066bc572) or this [Ninh Binh Klook activity](https://www.klook.com/en-PH/activity/25850-2d1n-ninh-binh-tour-hanoi/?spm=SearchResult.SearchResult_LIST&clickId=c5be10c707) (7:30AM - 7:30PM of Day 4)
* Day 4 - Rest, relax, and exploring Hanoi again (I will be flying back home the evening of)

I would like advice from other solo women travelers if this itinerary is okay, fair? If Hanoi will be good in terms of weather and getting around or the social interaction with solo women tourists, no scams hopefully? Has anyone else here done those Klook linked activities? How did you get around, is it walkable? Grab?

It is possible for me to move my flight for a fee to stay another 2 days but I'm not sure if there is anything else worth doing for that time allowance, unless you have other recommendations for better hikes near Hanoi with inclusive transfers (I want the scenery and the cardio-health advantage üòÄ). I think the hike and consideration for logistics will be the main issues if there will be any. Other than this please let me know of your recommendations for good coffee, walking spots, travel tips, or anything else!

Today, I realized that this isn‚Äôt good for me anymore. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have no issues with Reddit or similar platforms; my issue is me.  
My small win today is that I will continue to do the hard things that are needed to become a better version of myself.  I will recognize that setting boundaries for yourself can be healing; like a cast on a broken bone.  Sometimes we must feel limited in order for broken things to heal, but once it‚Äôs healed, the thing that aided in healing can cause more harm if not eventually removed.  
Sometimes things aren‚Äôt inherently wrong or even unhealthy, but if they don‚Äôt move you towards your goals or even worse, keep you stuck in alternative timelines, then those are things that I have to let go of if I gave any hope of acceptance and forward motion. 
I hope one day I will be able to as Ariel says, ‚Äúbe where the people are‚Äù but today I‚Äôm not there. 
The day I can be will be a‚Ä¶. good day, but it is not this day.

My brother turns 22 on the 18th, and he put me in charge of planning the day. He's really into shopping old vintage but high quality brands. I invited four of his friends, and in total there will be six of us. I want to do something where we can walk to every place we go to. The idea is to plan the whole day from where we drop the car off and be able to do stuff that is in walking distance. Example if we went to Huntington and did stuff in walking distance, what would the places be.

We do live on Long Island so I don't want to go to boring tourist spots even if we have never been.

I want us to look in some cool stores, maybe thrift stores, have a few brunch spots, maybe a good coffee spot, some nice sight seeing areas, free places, and toward the end of the day, an incredible steak spot. He loves steak and wants to go to a top notch steak restaurant hopefully on the island.

I included an example of how the day would be planned. However, keep in mind this is just a template.

-Leave: 11:00am 
-Arrive first location 11:40-12pm 
-Walk to brunch or coffee spot: 12-12:30pm 
-Walk to first shop: 12:40-12:55 
-Walk to next spot 1:30-1:40

Etc, etc.

The only thing is we would leave the house at or around 10:30am and have to be back home by 3:00. Then, leave again around 4:00 to go back out.

He wouldn't mind the day being spent with exact times at each location as he is pretty precise himself lol. Thank you!",1,1734327042.0,AskNYC,0,0.67,False

We are staying the first night at the Marriott Champlain (using up a free night certificate) then a cute Airbnb in on Rue St. Paul. I was thinking the outdoor terrace at the Champlain the first night since we‚Äôll be there anyway. Beyond that not sure. 

I love all cheese, what are the best local cheeses to try and also bring home? Raw milk cheese isn‚Äôt allowed in the US except under certain aging restrictions so especially interested in raw varieties. Is there a good fromagerie in Vieux Port? 

Is there also a good charcuterie in Vieux Port? I know Montreal is known for smoked meats but what about cured meats? 

I definitely want to prep a nice charcuterie board is there also a good bakery in Vieux port for a crusty baguette? Croissant recs also appreciated. 

As the title says one thing lacking in nyc that I love about the vieux port area are those old stone walls. Any cozy spots with this feature (coffee spots or speakeasies?). Again bc it‚Äôs cold (going next week) I doubt we will venture much out of the old port area. I looked at Cold Room and that seems to fit the bill. 

Finally random question: I used to be fluent in French I find I still am when drinking. Should I bother speaking French? Is it appreciated at all? My last visit to Canada several years back was to Quebec City and while I was easily understood I found the local accent a little tricky to understand. 

Oh one more‚Äî I‚Äôd love to pick up some yummy sandwiches on the way out for the drive back to nyc. Is there a good spot in old port or slightly out of town (that‚Äôs on the way?)

Hey everyone! I recently took a half-day trip to Muir Woods and Sausalito from San Francisco, and I felt compelled to share my experience because it was genuinely incredible. If you're planning to visit the Bay Area, this is definitely something you shouldn't miss.

First off, the whole experience was super convenient. Our guide picked us up right from our hotel in SF early in the morning (pro tip: morning tours are way less crowded!). The drive itself was beautiful - we crossed the Golden Gate Bridge with stunning views of the bay, and our guide shared fascinating stories about the area's history.

The star of the show was definitely Muir Woods. Walking among those ancient coastal redwoods was mind-blowing - some of these giants are over 600 years old! We spent about 1.5 hours exploring the trails, which was perfect. There's something magical about standing next to trees that reach heights of over 250 feet. The morning fog rolling through the canopy created this ethereal atmosphere that made for amazing photos.

After Muir Woods, we headed to Sausalito, this charming waterfront town that feels like you've been transported to the Mediterranean. We had about 45 minutes to explore the boutique shops, grab coffee, and enjoy the fantastic bay views. I grabbed lunch at a local seafood spot (the fish tacos were amazing!).

What made the tour special was our guide's knowledge - they really knew their stuff about the local ecosystem, history, and even recommended the best spots for photos. They were super accommodating and made sure everyone was comfortable throughout the trip.

For anyone interested in taking this tour (which I highly recommend), I booked through this link: https://athometouch.com/MuirWoods. The price includes everything - transportation, park entrance fees, and you even have the option to return by ferry if you want to spend more time in Sausalito.

Quick tips:
- Wear layers (the woods can be cool and damp)
- Bring comfortable walking shoes
- Take your camera!
- Consider the morning tour to avoid crowds
- Book in advance as spots fill up quickly

The whole experience takes about 5 hours, making it perfect for travelers with limited time. Honestly, seeing these majestic redwoods up close was a highlight of my San Francisco trip, and I can't recommend it enough.

Factors Influencing Teeth Whitening Results: Techniques, Duration, and Individual Variability
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular cosmetic practice, promising bright smiles and renewed confidence. However, not every whitening treatment yields the same results. Understanding the factors that influence these outcomes can enhance your whitening experience and help you achieve your desired shade. The results can vary significantly depending on the techniques used, the duration of the treatment, and individual variability.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Techniques for Teeth Whitening

There are various techniques available for teeth whitening, each with its own pros and cons. Here are some of the most common methods:

- **Professional In-Office Treatments:** These offer immediate results and are performed by dental professionals. They use stronger whitening agents, which can lighten teeth by several shades in just one session.
- **At-Home Kits:** Dental professionals can provide custom trays filled with whitening gel for at-home use. While they can be effective, the results may take longer compared to in-office treatments.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** These are readily available and more affordable. However, they often contain lower concentrations of bleaching agents, which may result in milder effects.
- **Whitening Strips:** Popular for their ease of use, these strips can be worn at home. Results may vary, and they might take several treatments to notice significant changes.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people opt for baking soda or charcoal to whiten their teeth. Effects are usually subtle and not always effective.

### Duration of Treatment

Duration plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of teeth whitening. Here's how different durations impact results:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Professional Treatments:** Typically last about one hour. This concentrated treatment can achieve dramatic results in a short period.
- **Custom-Fitted Trays:** Often recommended for a couple of hours daily over a week or two. While results are gradual, they can be significant after consistent use.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** These products often suggest wearing them for a set period, ranging from 30 minutes to two hours a day. Consistency is key to seeing improvement.
- **Whitening Strips:** Generally recommended for daily use over a two-week period, and results improve with continued application.

### Individual Variability in Results

Your unique dental characteristics can greatly influence whitening results. Consider these factors:

- **Natural Tooth Color:** Everyone's teeth naturally vary in hue. If you have darker teeth, you may require more sessions to achieve your desired brightness.
- **Stains:** The types and causes of stains (food, beverages, smoking) can affect how well whitening treatments work. Some stains respond better to whitening agents than others.
- **Dental Health:** Healthy gums and teeth typically respond better to whitening. If you have dental issues, consult your dentist before starting a whitening treatment.
- **Age:** As you age, enamel can wear down, affecting how stains interact with your teeth. Older individuals may notice differing results than younger ones.
- **Dietary Choices:** Regular consumption of staining substances, like coffee and red wine, may require more frequent maintenance treatments.

### Maintaining Your Results

After achieving your desired whiteness, maintaining those results is essential. Follow these tips to make your bright smile last:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush and floss regularly to prevent new stains from forming.
- **Limit Stain-Causing Foods:** Try to reduce intake of coffee, tea, red wine, and other staining substances.
- **Regular Dental Checkups:** Regular visits to your dentist help maintain overall oral health and keep your whitening results intact.
- **Touch-Up Treatments:** Consider occasional in-office touch-ups or at-home kits for maintained brightness.

Understanding how these factors affect teeth whitening results can empower you to make informed choices that suit your lifestyle and dental health. By selecting the right technique, adhering to the recommended duration, and considering your individual variability, you can achieve a radiant smile that boosts your confidence and enhances your overall appearance.

### Conclusion

Achieving a brighter smile can be a life-changing experience for many people. The transformative results from teeth whitening treatments reveal just how impactful these procedures can be. Whether you‚Äôre considering in-office treatments or at-home kits, the before and after experiences underscore the potential for a marked improvement in your smile. Clear, bright teeth not only enhance your appearance but also boost confidence, making you feel more attractive and approachable.

However, it‚Äôs important to remember that results can vary significantly among individuals. Factors such as the method used, the duration of treatment, and individual differences‚Äîincluding your natural tooth color and dental health‚Äîplay crucial roles in determining the effectiveness of whitening. For some, a single session may result in brilliant white teeth, while others may require multiple treatments to achieve their desired results.

He's really into shopping old vintage but high quality brands. I invited four of his friends, and in total there will be six of us. I want to do something where we can walk to every place we go to. The idea is to plan the whole day from where we drop the car off or (if we take the train which stop we would get off) and be able to do stuff that is in walking distance.

We do live on Long Island so I don't want to go to boring tourist spots even if we have never been.

I want us to look in some cool stores, maybe thrift stores, have a few brunch spots, maybe a good coffee spot, some nice sight seeing areas, free places we can check out like museums, and toward the end of the day, an incredible steak spot. He loves steak and wants to go to a top notch steak restaurant.

I included an example of how the day would be planned. However, keep in mind this is just a template.

-Leave: 11:00am -Arrive blank station: 11:40-12pm -Walk to brunch or coffee spot: 12-12:30pm -Walk to first shop: 12:40-12:55 -Walk to next spot 1:30-1:40

As someone who genuinely cares about their growth and well-being, it's disheartening to put in so much effort only to feel disrespected in return.

I have always believed that kindness and understanding are essential when working with younger individuals. However, respect for authority and experience often seems to be overlooked. While I continue to support and encourage them, I hope they recognize the importance of valuing the wisdom that comes with experience. After all, we can learn so much from one another if we're willing to listen.¬†

I do my best to take care of them: I automatically approve leave requests without question, take them out for lunch once or twice a week to restaurants of their choice, buy Starbucks coffee for them once a week, and provide unlimited access to office and pantry supplies, even for personal use. I offer access to resources and a structured onboarding process, celebrate birthdays with gifts, and advocate for merit increases and performance bonuses at the end of each year. I also give holiday gifts and souvenir gifts if I travel out of the country‚Äîall of these gestures come from a place of care for them. Unfortunately, they don't seem to appreciate it. Communication and listening are also challenging; they always have an answer to everything.

We recently organized an event where I booked them a hotel room and catered their food. Despite being very sick that day, I still did my best to help and supervise them. However, they all arrived late and abandoned me during the event before it was finished.

I often ask myself, am I giving too much to them? Am I mismanaging the team? I always provide guidance and help in any way I can, but perhaps I deserve this lack of appreciation because I don't know how to manage them effectively.¬†

I just feel so sad. As a new manager with only two years of experience, I thought that showing care for my team would lead them to care for me and the organization in return, but I was wrong.¬†¬†Every day, I disassociate from them, to the point that I feel like I am shutting down.

TL;DR: Managing young employees is challenging and disheartening. Despite my efforts to show care through support and resources, I often feel unappreciated and face communication issues. After organizing an event where I was neglected, I questioned if I was giving too much and mismanaging the team. I feel sad and disconnected, hoping for more mutual respect.",0,1734326279.0,managers,4,0.5,False

On our last date, as I was driving to the beach. He turns to me, puts his hand on my knee and says ""I can't hold it in anymore, I love you (my name)"". In a safe manner, I immediately put my brakes on and pull the car over to the side of the road. This man, startled lol, starts asking ""(my name) are you OK??!! Did something happen?""

1hfbxbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hermes/comments/1hfbxbx/is_there_something_wrong_with_my_dice/,Is there something wrong with my dice?,"Hello!!! I very recently began working with the God Hermes, and doing my research I decided to use communication with dice in which they assign a number to the answers while charging the pendulum with my energy. 
The first two days were excellent but one day my brother came into my room and grabbed the die from the altar of Hermes and from then on the die began to give very contradictory answers such as that Hermes does not like sweet things, that he does not like sweet things. He likes coffee or that he didn't like the things I had brought him and that he was angry with me but he didn't give me a clear reason no matter how many times I asked him. 

But I persisted and asked him to give me a sign that he liked me and still wanted to work with me. Just yesterday I dreamed that I was in a very beautiful forest but I felt a sense of relief and tranquility, which I took as a positive sign from him. Why today I decided to do something nice for Hermes, I saw new places (and even dared to go somewhere I was afraid of), I went to museums, I brought him feathers and a turtle keychain. 
So I came home very excited to tell Hermes all this but when I rolled the dice he told me that he didn't like things when I asked him and the truth is that I felt quite bad and in my anxiety I asked him if he still wanted to work. with me and the die gave me a strong no and I started crying.

At that moment I see that the Hermes candle is going crazy and I know he wants to tell me something so I asked him if he used the pendulum and the candle moved quite a bit. So I used him, he told me there was something wrong with the die, he was never mad at me and he definitely wants to work with me. I asked him if he would get rid of the die but he said no and that he still wants it on his altar. Do I have to do something to the die??? Did you clean it or something? Does this have any explanation?

PS: One good thing that happened from this is that for the first time I was able to receive a message from Hermes with the pendulum using my computer keyboard after about an hour but he said the following ""heh, good job darling"" and it felt very good :) 

PS 2: English is not my first language so if you have questions about the translation, don't hesitate to ask me.

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/I4wYwVCEPy): **November 8, 2024**

I (33m) have a pretty big age difference with my brother (44m). He had a child at 25, which means that I became an uncle at 14. Because we were pretty close in age, I formed a special bond with my niece, Ella (now 18f).

When she was 16, my brother and his family moved away so I've been seeing them less recently, but we keep in touch and catch up at family events.

Last year, at Christmas, my niece told me that she had a boyfriend and told me a bit about him, but I didn't know the guy. He was invited for Easter and a couple of other events, but was never able to make it. When we were planning our mother's birthday, my brother decided to invite Ella's boyfriend so that we could all meet him.

Yesterday was the birthday. I was looking forward to meeting Mark (Ella's boyfriend), but was very confused when I saw her walk in with a man that looked double her age (spoiler alert: he is). She introduced him to me, and I politely smiled but was deep down very concerned. I went to my brother to ask how old Mark was and he told me that Mark is 36, so literally double Ella's age. She had told me that he was ""a bit older"" but I assumed like early to mid twenties, not almost 40. That's when they called us in the living room to share ""exciting news"". Ella showed us a ring and revealed that they were engaged.

I just said ""what the fuck"" and everyone turned around and looked at me like I was crazy. I told them that they were out of their minds if they thought this was normal, that there was no world in which a 30 something should date an 18yo, and that she shouldn't be getting married. All of them accused me of ruining Ella's happiness. Some even said that I was jealous of Mark, which is so fucking disgusting I can't even explain it. I mean, I'm younger than Mark, but never in a million years would I ever consider dating someone younger than 25. They told me that it was perfectly legal as they were both adults, which isn't true because they've been dating for a year and Ella turned 18 7 months ago, and that if they were happy that's all that matters.

I told them that they were sick for allowing this and that he was a predator but they wouldn't listen. I know this isn't my business, but I can't help but fear for Ella. She is young and doesn't really know what she's getting into. I'm really scared of her getting married and being unable to leave him when she realizes how sick it was. I then left and slammed the door, and have been receiving pretty wild messages and calls since then. I don't know if I was wrong for this and am just overreacting, and if I wasn't wrong I don't know what I can do to make them realize how wrong it is. AITAH?

**Does OOP and his family know anything about the BF‚Äôs background?**

> **OOP:** I quickly went over his facebook account so it‚Äôs not really verified info, but I saw pictures of him with his ex (I think?) and she looked 20-24 maybe? It‚Äôs still better but if the guy has a thing for younger girls that‚Äôs even more wrong. And it seems like he was still with his ex when he started dating my niece, so even weirder‚Ä¶ 

**How did OOP‚Äôs niece meet the BF?**

> **OOP:** Through sports apparently. My niece does tennis and so does he, in the same club and they met during a tournament (at least that‚Äôs what she told me the first time she told me she had a boyfriend)

**Was the BF Ella‚Äôs coach when they met?**

> **OOP:** No I don‚Äôt think so. From what I understood, Ella was in a tournament in her club and she played against adults, she played against Mark and after he came to talk to her so they talked and that was basically it 

&nbsp;

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/FxekXi30AB): **November 9, 2024**

If you didn't see my previous post, here's a tl;dr: my niece is 18 and getting married with a man who's 36. They started dating when she was 17. When she announced she was engaged I said that it was wrong that he was so much older than her, but everyone else found it okay.

So I've taken the past 24h to really reflect on all of this, I tried to take in most of the advice in the comments, and here's what I have decided. I don't think that me telling her and everyone that the relationship is weird was wrong, I do however think that I did it wrong and it was pretty harsh because it was in the heat of the moment. But I still find this very creepy and don't think she should get married.

What I've decided to do is:

1. Apologize to her. I sent her a text saying I was sorry for my outburst and that I should've thought it through beforehand. I told her that I never wanted to make her feel like I didn't want her to be happy, and that I loved her very much and had her best interests in mind.

2. Ask her if we could talk about this. I asked if she would be okay and free to hang out and maybe get coffee this week to talk about all of this with a clear head. I really want to try and get her to see why it's weird and that maybe marrying him is not a great choice.

3. Explain myself to my brother. I sent him a text saying that I was sorry for the way I said it, but that I still thought that it needed to be said. I explained to him why I think Mark is a predator and this relationship could have a very negative and damaging impact on Ella.

I'm still waiting on their replies. I'll update when they reply, or when I see Ella (if she accepts), depending on how long it would take.

In the meantime, I really want to thank everyone who gave me advice and was constructive, and really tried to help my niece out of this situation. I also send my best to all of the people in the comments sharing similar stories when they were the teenager getting groomed. I'm so sorry this happened to you and I really hope you're doing better now.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP should be there for his niece should she have any further concerns or worries about her relationship with her BF**

> **OOP:** If she doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it then fine, it‚Äôs her choice. But the least I can do is ask her if she‚Äôd want to. You don‚Äôt just ‚Äúlet it go‚Äù when it‚Äôs predators we‚Äôre talking about. Do you know how trapped she can be for years if she goes through with it? The least I can do is try my best to let her know that it‚Äôs weird before she makes such a commitment. And if she doesn‚Äôt want to hear it then fine, but no one should just ‚Äúlet it go‚Äù when it comes to these things

+

> Yeah I‚Äôll definitely let her know that I‚Äôm always there, and be ready to help her get out of the relationship when it all goes wrong. But I think it‚Äôs also important to try and talk her out of it. It might not succeed, but if there‚Äôs even the slightest chance that it might then it‚Äôs worth trying. I‚Äôd rather she gets out of the relationship now than in 3 years when she‚Äôs traumatized by this guy

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/kGPvQ3Kjuj): **November 12, 2024 (four days later)**

Tl;dr of first posts: My 18yo niece is engaged to a 36yo she started dating when she was 17. No one in the family sees a problem. I asked to meet her to talk about it.

So, following my text (see last post), Ella replied and told me she agreed to meet with me and talk. I just came back from seeing her.

Here's how it went. She asked me what I wanted to tell her and I started explaining that I didn't think her relationship was very healthy, and that no older guy should want to date a teenager. I told her that she was an incredible woman so I wasn't saying it was weird that someone would want to marry her, but that guys my age normally shouldn't even look at a teenager. She wasn't convinced and said that sometimes it's true but sometimes it's okay. I asked her how she would feel if I told her that someone born today could be her future partner, and she said it felt really weird. I also asked her if she would consider dating someone younger than 15, and she said no.

I could see her starting to realize that Mark maybe didnt have the best intentions. I also asked her if she knew about his previous relationship, and she said ""vaguely"" and just told me the girl's name. I asked her if she knew how old the girl was and she said she was 21. I also asked her if she knew that their relationships overlapped and she said that Mark always told her he was single since they met, but she kind of felt like that wasn't true. I told her that since his previous girlfriend was also significantly younger it seemed like he had a thing for younger girls, which is kind of weird.

After discussing that, she told me a bit more about her relationship. She told me she was starting to feel weird about it because of Mark's recent behavior. I asked what she meant and she said that he had been flirting with a lot of girls, who were all also younger, including some of Ella's friends. When she confronted him he sort of gaslit her into thinking it wasn't flirting. He was also making a lot of comments about having children with Ella and how cute it would be to see her raise them. She told me she was absolutely not ready for that and also wanted to go to college and work and not be a SAHM. Because of all of that she was doubting her relationship and I told her that I understood.

She said she was scared of breaking up with him because he had become her whole life recently and she didn't know what she would do without him. I told her that she was surrounded by people who loved her and would be there for her, and that she was a lot more than just Mark's girlfriend. I said that she knew my opinion on it, but that ultimately the choice was hers, and that I just wanted her to be happy. I also said I would be there for her no matter what. She told me that she will try to break up with him this week, and she'll let me know how it goes. I'll edit this post if I have more info.

Also, again, thank you to everyone who gave advice and tried to help us. I really appreciate it.

Edit: Okay so I just want to say, some people in the comments seem to think that this is fake, and you know what, I can understand. And I don't really care, I'm not asking you to believe that my life is real or fake, and it's great that you don't just believe everything you see online. But I just want to say this: there are hundreds of people on here or elsewhere that share similar stories. I'm not really affected by people thinking I'm lying, mainly because I'm not the one in that situation. But some people might be. Some people come on here to share something that might have traumatized them, and the last thing they want is for others to think they're lying. So if you don't want to believe me that's fine, but the next time keep that to yourself. It's fine to not believe something, but you don't have to say it, because it might make other people feel really bad.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/bLymIxqNlx): **December 9, 2024 (almost one month later)**

I know it's been a while since I posted the last update and a lot of people have been requesting updates on the whole situation, but until now I hadn't really received any news. So please forgive me if this update took a while to come.

Since my conversation with Ella, I would check in on her once or twice a week and ask how things were and she'd always tell me pretty much the same as what she told me a month ago. Basically, there were many red flags and she was getting more and more uncomfortable in her relationship but she also didn't know how to break up with him. I tried to give her some advice but eventually told her that I thought she should do it when she felt comfortable.

Yesterday I called her to know what she had planned on Christmas and if she'd be coming to the Christmas dinner that I was hosting, and if Mark would be coming. That's when she told me that she had broken up with him the evening before. She was pretty shaken up so I didn't ask for too much detail and asked if she wanted to come to my house for a while. She said that Mark had left to stay with his family when she told him, so she was okay staying home.

This is maybe not a very detailed update but here's what I know. She told me that he had been getting angry at her all week for small things. And then they were talking about Christmas and he insisted that they shouldn't go with Ella's family and instead spend a week with his family because they see them less often (they live out of state). And after that he made a comment about how he hoped that the next year as a present they could give his mother a grandchild, and Ella said that's what really made her break up with him. And she also told me that she would be coming alone for Christmas.

I don't know what she told him or how he reacted, and maybe she'll tell me more in a while when she feels better, and if not I won't ask her to. If I get more information I'll edit this post but for now that's it. Again, thank you to anyone who gave advice and tried to help with this situation.

**Commenter 2:** Thank God for Ella.

You are an amazing person and a wonderful uncle.  She is incredibly lucky to have you in her life 

**Commenter 3:** Thank goodness Ella has you; your words may have spared her quite a bit of pain. I am happy she's broken up with him; hopefully he doesn't weasel his way back into her home.

It would be twenty five lonely years before he finally found someone. She was smart and a fellow brunette, shorter than him - which he liked, and her name was Donna. 

Craig very much enjoyed having Donna as his girlfriend; their weekly dates where they walked around the suburbs and quiet footpaths; the little cakes they had in little isolated coffee shops; the way she held the back of his hand and kissed him on that cute spot on the side of his nose. To him, there was barely anything else. 

However, Craig felt like there was something missing, and he couldn't put his finger on it. 

He'd waited his whole life to have a girlfriend, and yet something about the whole thing felt a bit... fake? Or was it only him that was feeling fake? Did it have something to do with him still being a virgin? He didn't really know what words to say, or how to say them to her. 

They went to a fair once. It was late in the night while they walked through the dazzling lights as boyfriend and girlfriend, just as Craig had fantasised about since he was a teenager. 

At a particular point, however, a terrible feeling rose up within and consumed him. He became all alone, even though Donna was right beside him. 

He knew Donna wouldn't be able to love him like this forever. Also, she deserved better. 

In the same breath, he couldn't live without her now. His escape from loneliness had been so miraculous, he doubted that it could ever happen again. 

So no, he needed her. His girlfriend Donna. 

And if he couldn't have her, if she was destined to leave him, then- 

""Everything is fake. It's not real."" He rehearsed over and over, while walking her home that night - did so until he worked himself up into a right nasty state. 

Once they were inside, she invited him up into her bedroom, but Craig was gone - only his body was there. 

Before she could blink, she was pinned to the ground with Craig snarling like an animal. 

The all-consuming pretence which had followed him his whole life - had been a compliant persona -burying the longing for a connection much more physical and ancient than society had allowed him to reveal. 

It was only after the fact that he knew he had killed his love. Craig was sad, but in a state of aliveness he hadn't felt since he was a child. 

He finally felt close to Donna. He finally felt like himself. ",7,1734324384.0,shortscarystories,3,1.0,False

Hi guys!

  
Our third roommate moved out at the end of last month and we are looking for someone to take over her part of the lease. Our lease finishes  at the end of August 2024, and we are hopefully looking to renew it.

About Apartment:

  
This is a 3 bedroom, 2 bath (bathrooms are not assigned) . Our net rent is $3775, so we each pay approx $1245 each before utilities, electric is usually somewhere between $300 to $350 total.

  
Your room would be the one on the pic and it's the one in the middle of the apartment, it's the second largest room. It has a closet and central AC!

  
Located in the middle of Bedstuy, the closest train is the A/C train on utica, which is more or less a 8/10 walk depending how fast you walk. Next one would be the J/Z on Kosciusko, but that's more of a 15min walk. Our neighborhood is very clean and quiet, and that's what we love about it! There's a deli right on the corner, liquor store and grocery store on the same black. Plenty of coffee shops and cute Restaurants not too far.

  
The building has plenty of amenities! including a gym, three lounges (one of them with a piano and pool table, theater room, pet spa, rooftop and a laundry room!

  
About Us:

  
Me: 23 year old male, gay, work in the service industry but on the corporate side. So my schedule is Monday thru Friday. I love cooking, and love to party, so we will definitely have a good time if you love going out!

  
2nd Roomie: 22 year old girl, she's a server so her schedule fluctuates a little more. She is a bit more reserved but super sweet and fun, more of a home buddy but a fun time when we hang out and go out! She also smokes weed, so if you do aswell, you definitely will get along.

  
About you:

  
Ideally in your 20's a well. We would ideally want someone we can go out with and do fun things at home, not a total stranger, but we understand if you are more reserved. Definitely must be LGBTQ and pot friendly :). Male or female, both welcome!. Ideally you work in the service industry aswell, but not a deal breaker! Students and other professions are welcome. We would also prefer people who are single, our last roommate had her boyfriend over everyday and that cause a lot of trouble, and we don't want to repeat that again.



If you are interest please hit me up, we would like to interview roommates this week to pick one and start approval process with the management company! ",1,1734324383.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False

1hfbdq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_Connect/comments/1hfbdq4/how_vpns_improve_online_privacy_and_security_a/,How VPNs Improve Online Privacy and Security: A Comprehensive Guide,"In today‚Äôs digital world, online privacy and security are growing concerns for many individuals. Whether you‚Äôre browsing the web, accessing sensitive accounts, or simply checking your email, your data is constantly exposed to potential threats. One of the most effective ways to safeguard your privacy and enhance your online security is by using a VPN (Virtual Private Network). In this post, we‚Äôll explain how VPNs work, and how they can improve your online privacy and security by providing encryption, anonymity, and protection from various cyber threats.

1. What is a VPN?

A VPN is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device (such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet) and the internet. When you use a VPN, your internet traffic is routed through a remote server operated by the VPN provider. This process masks your IP address, encrypts your data, and ensures that your online activities remain private.

In simpler terms, a VPN acts as a shield that keeps your sensitive data secure and prevents unauthorized access while you're online.

2. How VPNs Improve Your Online Privacy

1. Encryption: Protecting Your Data from Eavesdroppers

One of the most important features of a VPN is encryption. When you connect to a VPN, your internet traffic is encrypted using AES-256-bit encryption, which is one of the strongest encryption standards available. This means that anyone trying to intercept your data‚Äîsuch as hackers, government agencies, or even your Internet Service Provider (ISP)‚Äîcannot read or access your online activities.

This is especially important when using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often unsecured and vulnerable to attacks. With encryption, even if someone manages to intercept your data, it will be unreadable without the encryption key.

2. Hiding Your IP Address: Anonymity Online

Every device that connects to the internet is assigned a unique IP address, which reveals your location and can be used to track your online activities. By using a VPN, your real IP address is hidden, and the VPN server‚Äôs IP address is used instead. This helps you stay anonymous while browsing the internet.

For example, if you're browsing the web without a VPN, websites you visit can track your IP address and potentially gather data about your location, browsing habits, and preferences. With a VPN, your true location is masked, making it difficult for websites and advertisers to track your activities.

3. Preventing Tracking and Profiling

Websites and advertisers use your IP address to track your online behavior and create a profile for targeted advertising. By masking your real IP address with a VPN, it becomes much harder for these parties to build an accurate profile of your online activities. This is particularly useful for avoiding unwanted ads and maintaining your privacy.

3. How VPNs Enhance Your Online Security

1. Protection on Public Wi-Fi Networks

Public Wi-Fi networks, such as those in coffee shops, airports, or hotels, are convenient but often insecure. Hackers can easily intercept unencrypted data on these networks, putting your personal information at risk. A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel for your data, ensuring that your sensitive information (like passwords, banking details, and personal messages) remains private and protected, even when you're connected to a public Wi-Fi network.

2. Preventing Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

In a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, cybercriminals intercept communication between you and a website or server, often to steal sensitive information. Without a VPN, your data can be exposed to MITM attacks, especially on unsecured networks. With a VPN, your data is encrypted and securely routed through the VPN server, making it much harder for attackers to intercept or alter your communications.

3. DDoS Protection: Mitigating Distributed Denial of Service Attacks

A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack occurs when a malicious party floods a server or network with an overwhelming amount of traffic, causing it to crash. VPNs help protect against DDoS attacks by masking your real IP address and routing traffic through the VPN server. This makes it more difficult for attackers to target your device or network with such attacks, especially in online gaming or when using public servers.

4. Additional Ways VPNs Improve Privacy and Security

1. No-Logs Policy: Ensuring Your Activities Stay Private

A trusted VPN provider will have a no-logs policy, which means it does not track or store your online activities. This is important because it ensures that even if the VPN provider is asked by authorities to hand over data, there is no information to share. Always choose a VPN that operates under a no-logs policy for the best privacy protection.

2. Bypassing Censorship: Freedom of Access

In some countries, governments impose strict censorship on internet access, blocking certain websites and platforms. A VPN helps users bypass these restrictions by masking their location and allowing them to connect to servers in other countries. This way, users can access the free and open internet, regardless of local censorship laws.

3. Multi-Device Protection: Secure All Your Devices

Many VPNs allow you to connect multiple devices under a single subscription. This means that you can protect your smartphone, tablet, laptop, and even smart TV with one VPN account. With more devices connected to the internet, it‚Äôs important to ensure that all your devices are secured to avoid vulnerabilities.

5. VPN Use Cases for Privacy and Security

1. Protecting Sensitive Data While Working Remotely

Remote work has become increasingly common, and securing communications between remote workers and company servers is essential. VPNs allow employees to securely access company networks, documents, and other sensitive information without worrying about data breaches or surveillance.

2. Preventing ISP Throttling

ISPs sometimes intentionally slow down your internet connection based on the type of activity you're doing, such as streaming or gaming. A VPN masks your online activity from your ISP, preventing them from throttling your connection and ensuring faster speeds.

3. Safe Online Shopping and Banking

When making online purchases or banking transactions, you want to ensure your personal and financial data is protected. A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, reducing the risk of cybercriminals intercepting your credit card details or banking information.

6. How to Choose the Right VPN for Privacy and Security

When choosing a VPN to improve your online privacy and security, look for the following features:

Strong Encryption (AES-256): Ensure the VPN offers robust encryption to protect your data.

No-Logs Policy: Choose a VPN that does not store or track your activity.

Wide Server Network: More servers in different countries mean better access to geo-restricted content and more security options.

Kill Switch: The Kill Switch feature ensures that your data is not exposed if the VPN connection drops.

DNS Leak Protection: Prevents your DNS requests from leaking and revealing your online activities.

Some of the best VPN providers for privacy and security include ExpressVPN, NordVPN, CyberGhost, and ProtonVPN.

7. Conclusion

VPNs play a crucial role in enhancing your online privacy and security by encrypting your data, masking your IP address, and protecting you from cyber threats. Whether you're browsing on public Wi-Fi, streaming geo-restricted content, or simply want to maintain your privacy, using a VPN ensures that your sensitive information is secure and your online activities remain private. By choosing a trustworthy VPN provider, you can enjoy a safer, more secure internet experience.

Dearest reader,

I'm sending you this letter because I saw you lurking on reddit again and wanted to say hi. Specifically to you though, not the other people reading this. No those other people are cool, but I'd rather be avoiding my job today with you. Plus they wouldn't understand our lame humor anyway. And our overly sarcastic way of speaking, even though it doesn't translate well through text. Rarely does it translate well through text.

I know I know, you said you were busy today. You have all those things on your to do list, you should really be focusing right now, and plus you didn't really sleep all that great last night. I get it. But all I'm saying is, take a break for 5 minutes. I know you haven't had enough water yet today, so relax for a sec. I'll even pick you up something for that little coffee shop near by. The aesthetically pleasing one that has just-okay over priced coffee but the place is such a nice vibe and you feel like it's a small victory whenever you can spend money at a local shop instead of going to Starbucks again this week. Yea that place!

We could talk about your day, or your week if you want. Did you wanna vent about that thing your co-worker said that you don't care about anymore but you still care about for some inexplicable reason? Or I could talk if you just want to listen.

But I'm gonna run to the coffee shop now, but remind me. What did you want me to pick you up again?

I can only think of coffee and ADHD medication as things that I have consumed that made me feel energized. ",2,1734323646.0,chronicfatigue,1,0.76,False

I recently started an overnight job (10-6am) with twins both boys, 3 weeks old. I get paid $31 hr & my schedule is 3-4 days a week. I wanted some insight into if my NF is blurring the lines between nanny, household manager, and maid duties. I often times, will just do it all to appease families, and in the end feel underpaid, or as if I‚Äôm doing too much so opinions would be lovely.          
       Currently, I am in charge of all feedings throughout the night (12 & 3), but both boys are cluster feeding, so normally ends up being an extra 30-45 mins of feeding per scheduled feeding. 

  My question, comes into play with the things my NF are asking me to do in addition to regular childcare. 
To me, regular duties include children‚Äôs laundry, bottle prep, bottle sanitization, breast pump, sanitization, breast milk storage, feedings, and diaper changes. IE, anything directly related to the children.

 Here are some of the things they have asked me to do, this past week: 
Parents laundry ( also normal to me 1-2 loads) cleaning sink, unloading dishwasher, (normal to me) clean countertops, vacuum & mop, (been every night I‚Äôve worked) prep their water bottles & coffee machine 1 hr prior to my departure, clean glass display shelves, take down pack n play, build new pack n play, hang shoe rack, fill spice jars, cut fruits, box store returns etc ‚Ä¶ 
  Would you consider doing these tasks for an additional charge? Or negate these tasks at all? 
 Thanks in advance!! ",4,1734323560.0,Nanny,5,1.0,False

1hfb6bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowed/comments/1hfb6bo/28_yo_widow/,28 yo Widow,"My husband died almost a year ago after a year and a half of the worst hell I could have ever imagined. He was diagnosed with AML aka a terribly aggressive leukemia after 4 days of feeling ill. He went through agony of almost constant hospitalizations and treatments including many painful procedures. I took a leave to be his sole caregiver after his POS family completely abandoned him. We moved across the country to one of the best cancer centers in the world to give him the best chance. Even still, he died. He died after I held his hand for 12 agonizing hours telling him it‚Äôs okay to let go. 

I felt a sense of relief after about 4 months which feels heartless to say. I was relived at not going to the hospital every day. Not seeing my love suffer. Not begging for good news and always getting bad. Not begging for one more day or wondering when the last one would be. Not waking up every few hours to check his breathing. Not being the bad guy begging him to listen to the doctors and continue a life that was to him completely miserable. This year, I found myself again. I could go to the gym or on a walk. I could go to restaurants or coffee shops. I could buy a new sweater or sneakers if I wanted to. I began dating about 6 months after he passed and I found someone wonderful. He allows me space to grieve and listens when I need it. 

I‚Äôm happy now, and I feel so guilty for that. I‚Äôm also struggling with certain items like my wedding dress. I imaged keeping it forever, but every time I see it I just remember that the happy ending I pictured was all just a dream. When I see my Christmas tree, I think of the children I imagined us having that will never be. My boyfriend NEVER encourages me to give anything away, but I also don‚Äôt want to put up a tree ment for my husband and I only to spend it with someone else. It feels cheap and wrong. I‚Äôm mostly venting and appreciate anyone who made it this far into my rant. If anyone has experienced something similar I would love to know your thoughts. ",9,1734323403.0,widowed,0,1.0,False

I just got back from an incredible Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Las Vegas, and I had to share my experience. It was honestly one of the best day trips I've ever taken, and I thought some of you might be interested in hearing about it.

First off, I was a bit hesitant about the 14-hour duration, but it turned out to be totally worth it. The bus picked me up right from my hotel (super convenient), and it was actually pretty comfortable with AC and a bathroom on board. Our driver/guide, Mike, was hilarious and kept us entertained with interesting facts about the desert landscape and local history during the drive.

We made a quick stop in Kingman, Arizona, which was perfect for grabbing some coffee and stretching our legs. But the real magic started when we approached the canyon. Nothing prepares you for that first view at Mather Point - it literally took my breath away. The colors, the scale, the way the sunlight plays on the rocks... photos really don't do it justice.

Throughout the day, we visited several viewpoints along the South Rim, including Bright Angel Point, which offers some of the most stunning panoramas I've ever seen. Pro tip: bring a good camera! The meal voucher included with the tour came in handy for lunch, and the food was surprisingly decent.

I opted for the helicopter upgrade (around 25 minutes), and holy cow - seeing the canyon from above was a complete game-changer. If your budget allows, I highly recommend it. Some people in our group did the Hummer tour instead and said it was awesome too.

The National Geographic Visitor Center was really interesting, and the IMAX movie (optional upgrade) gives you a great overview of the canyon's history and formation.

For those interested, I booked through this link: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim
The basic tour starts at $80, which is honestly a steal considering everything that's included. They frequently run specials too.

A few quick tips from my experience:
- Wear layers (it can get chilly at the rim)
- Bring snacks for the bus ride
- Don't forget sunscreen and water
- Charge your phone/camera fully
- Try to sit on the right side of the bus for the best views

Overall, this tour was the highlight of my Vegas trip. If you're on the fence about taking a day away from the Strip, just do it - you won't regret it. The Grand Canyon is one of those places that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime.

Coming from a Nespresso Original. Please excuse my lack of knowledge as this is a whole new world to me. Not a barista, just a fan of coffee. The learning curve is significantly more than I anticipated.

I have probably 10 total hours racked up in this machine and have yet to pour a good shot. 

I have consulted charts and YouTube videos and this subreddit. 

I need help dialing this in. I went through an entire pound of Starbucks Blonde roast and never came close.  After reading this subreddit, I opted for a better quality, fresher bean. I am now using La Colombe Nizza. 

Since then, the results have been way closer than I ever was with the Starbucks.

I am using a digital scale, everything else I‚Äôm using is what was included with the express.

My last four pulls results and settings (all measuring out 18 g of espresso, with the Inner burr at 2, using the double shot button):

1) Grind size 9. 
:30 extraction. 
Good pressure.
Only 21 g of espresso.

2) Grind size 11.
Watery.
46 g of espresso. 

3) Grind size 10. 21 g of espresso. Pressure was fine. 

4) Grind size 11.  :25 extraction. 31 g of espresso 

I have not touched the ‚Äúgrind amount‚Äù dial yet. It just sits directly in the middle at 3 PM. 

It seems to keep flip flopping between under and overextraction. 

Please help. I‚Äôm feeling very frustrated and dejected. I‚Äôm worried I make a big mistake. Someone today told me to get the Cafe Affetto instead. Does this ever get easier?
