1jye0jr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jye0jr,Japan pourover craziness — are Wine glasses better than coffee cups?,"Just back from an epic 3 week trip to Japan where I had many insane meals, cocktails, and many of the GOAT pour over cafes (Lilo, Kurasu, Glitch, Nadoya No Katte, Acid, Woodberry, Hario Cafe, etc etc). Needless to say it was an epic tour!

At Acid Coffee in Tokyo, which had the largest / craziest selection of home roasted beans I’ve ever seen in one spot, they served the coffee in beautiful reidel wine glasses. The coffee shined!

Anyway this morning on my first day back home, I made two coffees (cup of excellence winner from Lilo and incredible rum barrel aged bean from Glitch) and tasted them both in ceramic vs reidel wine glasses. 

Oh crap…

Without question the wine glasses tasted better for both coffees. The way they throw the coffee into your mouth celebrates the beans far better, especially the high end flavor notes, much more clear and discernible. Just beautiful on the pallet. 

On the downside, the wineglasses dissipate heat faster than ceramic, and get hot to the touch. But the flavor note improvements were material enough to justify using them now. I can’t see how other glasses would out perform. There’s a reason that wines are served in these glasses.  

Crap I say! Does this mean I now need to start serving friends and family (and myself) pour over in expensive wineglasses to unlock next level flavor notes? Possibly! Has anyone else experimented with wine glasses? 

I’m not sure if James Hoffman or Lance Hedrick or anyone else has done a video on wineglasses for pour over but I couldn’t find any and it feels like an important A/B test vs other glass / cup types for coffee nerds out there. 

Has anyone else experimented with wine glasses and found similar or different results? ",2,1744567879.0,pourover,0,0.75,False

I figured out two new tips that have helped me with the desire to overeat or eat junk food and I thought i'd share it with ya'll in case anyone else might want to try these!

Tip #1: blast your favorite music. Something that puts you in a good mood or makes you happy. This'll literally drown out the food noise (desire to overeat) and the music will put you in a good mood too! This worked for me when I drove past a coffee shop and wanted to buy a couple of cookies. 

Tip #2: Shower. For some reason, the shower helps a lot. I think because it's distracting but I'm not sure. For some reason is work for me though. ",1,1744567732.0,PetiteFitness,0,1.0,False

Did this for 7 consecutive days, 2-3 extractions a day, maybe 17-18 total extractions. Dropped the screen and put it on a plate and took this picture. 

I also took a picture of the underside of the group head including the diffuser so you can see how dirty it is (in actuality it surprisingly clean for not being cleaned for a week and nearly 20 extractions).

Amazon Search: A Light In The Fog - Understand Borderline by Linder

Imagine sitting in a Viennese café, March 2025, the scent of coffee in the air, grey clouds drifting across the rooftops outside.
Next to you, Anna is laughing, her eyes sparkling like gas lanterns as she chats with Lisa about a book – a lost traveler who touched her deeply.
But the clatter of a tray turns her laughter into silence – “I don’t belong here,” she whispers, then flees, her footsteps echoing across the wooden floor.
Lisa remains behind, the cup cold, her heart heavy: “What did I miss?”
That’s how *A Light in the Fog* begins – a journey through Anna’s world with borderline personality disorder, and Lisa’s path as her sister: a dance between light and shadow, love and doubt.

This book isn’t a dry manual – it’s a companion. For you, who loves someone whose moods ignite like sparks, without warning.
“Maybe you know the feeling,” the narrator whispers, “a moment when everything flips.”
With around 20,000 words, the story unfolds in seven chapters plus an appendix, carried by poetic imagery – “a veil lifts,”* “a fire flares”* – and set against the backdrop of Vienna: from the Prater to the Danube.
It’s for those who see themselves in Anna, and for loved ones who share Lisa’s questions:
“Why is she like this? What can I do?”
Without blame or clinical jargon, it reveals borderline as an intense form of perception – “a radio jumping between stations” – and offers understanding, a compass through the storm.

After a busy week, getting so-so sleep most nights, I exercised, journaled, and was excited to not have an alarm set for early in the morning. I took my medication: 50mg trazodone, 10mg melatonin, and a cup of zzquil. 

I ended up waking up after 4 hours, the worst night of the entire week. Since this was unacceptable, I took another cup of zzquil in the morning, hoping to be able to fall back asleep. It didn't work. I rolled around in bed for about 2 hours, and from then on I knew it was just going to be an extremely groggy day. I had planned to go out in the evening, but this didn't happen. I only got out of bed to make coffee and some breakfast which just stayed in the plate all day because I was too tired too eat. My only meal for the day was Popeyes I ordered in around midnight.

Anyway, around 5pm I broke down in sobs because this isn't how I want to spend my Saturdays. I can handle not sleeping well throughout the week, but I can't handle it on my days off which are supposed to be a reprieve, and when I'm supposed to have a social life. I hate the idea that this is what my weekends look like, it's being happening to varying degrees since 2021. I'm 24 years old, by 50 I'll probably be friendless with dementia at this rate.

Up until now, I’ve shared single-task prompts-focused, effective tools for getting the most out of ChatGPT and other LLMs. But today marks a shift. I’m starting to share **agentic prompt systems**, modular, multi-agent workflows that you can adapt to any agentic framework. Whether you're using CrewAI, LangGraph, or something homegrown, these prompt stacks are designed for *coordination*, not just completion.  The script below is for CrewAI but it could be used with other frameworks.

The first system I'm releasing was inspired by a request from someone in my Discord channel. It simulates a full executive team, analyst, strategist, pricing expert, and negotiator, working in sequence to diagnose a company and design a strategy. I’ll be posting more of these in the days ahead, so keep an eye out. And as always, if you need a custom prompt or a full agentic build tailored to your use case, don’t hesitate to reach out, I’ve got you covered.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Los Angeles Angels and the Houston Astros, two teams that make you question if baseball is more about the sport or the drama. As they square off at Daikin Park, the Astros are the -149 moneyline favorites. But let's be honest, after their 14-3 shellacking on Friday, they might be feeling more like the underdogs in their own minds.

Starting for the Astros is Hayden Wesneski, who’s hoping to avoid the kind of performance that makes his ERA look like a blood pressure reading. Meanwhile, the Angels counter with Kyle Hendricks, who’s been as reliable as a Wi-Fi connection in a crowded coffee shop.

The Angels have been the underdog 10 times this season and have won six of those games, which means they’re either really good at defying expectations or just enjoy making gamblers sweat. On the flip side, the Astros have hit the over five times this season, which is about as frequent as a solar eclipse compared to the Angels, who’ve hit the over in nine of their 13 games. Clearly, the Angels like their games like their movies—full of action and explosions.

Key players to watch include Mike Trout, who’s been hitting homers like he's trying to impress a date in the stands, and Jose Altuve, who leads the Astros with three home runs and a batting average that suggests he’s been practicing with a tennis racket.

For the best bet, consider taking the Over at 8.5 runs. With both teams showing a penchant for high-scoring affairs and the Angels' recent offensive fireworks, this game could easily turn into a slugfest. Plus, who doesn't love a good old-fashioned run-fest on a Sunday afternoon? So, grab your popcorn, place your bets, and prepare for a game that might just redefine the term ""hitting it out of the park.""

She lives about 11 miles away and would need to take the train to see me. The trian wasn't running so she had to get a bus and it took an hour, I thought this sucked but she set up the date this time so I thought she was okay with it.

We went out, got coffee and ice cream and generally I thought it was a good time. I walked her back to the bus and she went home. Now she's saying it's too far and she doesn't this will work but she's happy to keep talking...

If just told her if it isn't going anywhere I'd rather we go our own ways. I don't want a friend. I want a partner.

In no way shape or form am I trying to keep kids parents from purchasing beverages with caffeine in them but I truly think parents should know this. I don’t care THAT much to try to stop a kid or parent from buying caffeinated beverages. Idk why it is not a rule for us to tell them this or at least have a caffeine free section of our menu. Ran into a customer ordering a blonde latte for a 5-6 year old child quite a while ago and it brought me to reddit to let people know. Order as you please but please be aware of what you are ordering and WHATS IN YOUR DRINK! Simply telling customers with small children “This drink has caffeine are you okay with that?” is a perfect way to advise customers with children.

I have a sage barista express approx 5 years.

I cleaned it with the regular cleaning cycle whenever the flashing light came on over the years .I never knew that it needed to be descaled also until recently.

I performed the normal cleaning cycle and a descale using the instructions and recommended products.

I also washed through 3 tanks of water in addition to the recommended amount. The coffee tasted awful - almost no taste in a way or what I d imagine drinking plastic would taste like.

I washed through a few more tanks of water through the system and still no change. I performed the normal cleaning cycle(plus more washed more water through it) and still the same issue.

Can anyone advise?

First, for being 19 years old, that's not a terrible symphony. 

Second, it sounds like a student's work. There is so much Beethoven in it that if I didn't know it was Wagner, I would have guessed it to be a long-lost Beethoven work. 

Third, you can hear his voice in it, albeit faintly. I'm also pretty sure he decided he wasn't a symphonic composer. He clearly has a flair for the dramatic. It isn't necessarily *lyrical,* but it is definitely more dramatic than Beethoven, which would have led me to question whether it was Beethoven (obvs). 

Fourth, I think instead of composing symphonies, it would be interesting to hear what he would have done along the R. Strauss way of composing: The Tone Poem.

Parts of the symphony could be part of a tone poem. 

I know Wagner was a contemporary of Verdi and Tchaikovsky, but this symphony sounds like Beethoven's son had a baby with Verdi's daughter, and that baby met up with Tchaikovsky for a coffee in Vienna, ca. 1845 or so.",2,1744566811.0,classicalmusic,0,0.75,False

Getting in there is enough of a challenge; you can only enter from one entrance that is damn near impossible to get to unless you’re already traveling towards it on Chippewa. The line was long but moving weirdly fast, and there’s no menu in sight. A peppy girl came to my window to take my order. Not having studied the menu beforehand and with none in sight, I said I didn’t know. She flipped her tablet around and starts rattling off different names and going to different tabs to show me 85,000 different drink options with a careless sense of urgency that seemed to say “just pick one so I can keep this line moving”. I picked a blondie, because it was prominent on the menu, and she asked if half & half is okay, I asked about milk options. Again, she carelessly rattled on 17 different milk options. I said half & half is fine. She asked what size, I asked what the sizes are. We talked sweetness levels and I went for half. The drink cost almost $7. I pulled forward and the girl hanging off drinks rattles off my order and asks if it’s mine. Noticing the first full-size menu available to me as a customer behind her, I laugh and say maybe, I don’t know what I was ordering and I’m just now seeing a menu. She gave a fake chuckle and said I know for next time. 

I just took my first sip and this is the sweetest god damn “coffee” I’ve ever had in my life!!!! I think I understand this place now. It’s for those who don’t really care what the taste profile or quality of the coffee even is, they just want sugar milk. This even puts Starbucks or McDonald’s iced coffee to shame in terms of pure sugar. I couldn’t stand the attitude of everyone who worked there, seemingly annoyed I didn’t have my order memorized and ready to drone on to her as soon as she walked up. 

Again, the drink is so damn sweet. If this is half sweet, I would hate to taste the full sweetness version. With the way the lines are at this place, you’d think they were selling liquid gold! Sadly it just tastes like pure syrup to me.

“If I Ever Call You Love”

I used to say—
I don’t need anyone.
Not him, not them.
I’ve got my girls, my sister,
And a shelf full of books that never let me down.

I love my own company.
Coffee in quiet corners,
Plans to live with plants,
A cat curled up in the sun—
Wandering the world with a heart full of spirit,
And no strings to pull me back.

Because love…
Real love…
Feels lost out here.
Truth buried under pretty lies,
Intentions hard to read,
And I fear—
That the one thing I believe in most,
Might disappear too.

But then,
Sometimes—
When the wind feels softer than usual,
Or I find myself holding two cups instead of one
When the sky is a little too pink,
Or a song plays too perfectly,
I wonder…

What if?

What if there’s someone—
True, through and through.
Not perfect, just right.
Someone who hears me when I ramble about a book I just read,
Who eats noodles with me in bed,
Laughs at my silly late-night dances,
And plays my favorite songs without being asked.

What if there’s someone who brings me flowers—
Even though I grow my own?
Someone who doesn’t need to look at me
To know I’m there—
Someone I wouldn’t be afraid to lean on.

Would I trade my solitude for that kind of love?
Would I risk the quiet I’ve built
For something that might be beautiful—
Or break me?

I don’t know yet.
And that not knowing…
It’s the hardest part.

But if I ever call you love—
Know it’s not because I need you.
It’s because I choose you,
Over everything I already love

Would I risk the quiet I’ve built
For something that might be beautiful—
Or break me?

I don’t know yet.
And that not knowing…
It’s the hardest part.

But if I ever call you love—
Know it’s not because I need you.
It’s because I choose you,
Over everything I already love

Not even 10 minutes later, my heart started racing to around 150bpm. It stayed like this for 12 hours, and after this I had difficulty breathing.

Fast forward months later, I'm still experiencing:

* Constant yawning (can't get enough air even when yawning)
* Persistent difficulty breathing that only stops when I sleep and reappears randomly after waking up
* Severe and CONSTANT dry mouth on awakening that has not gone away for a single day since the incident
* Occasional dizziness and light-headedness (feels like I'm going to faint)
* Initially had lack of appetite that resolved after a few weeks
* One random episode of feeling really cold

I had a 2-week period where symptoms disappeared completely, which occurred about 3 weeks after they began. Then I suddenly started getting a bad coughing fit 2 hours after waking up, and all symptoms returned.

My digestive system has also been affected,  I've had alternating constipation and diarrhea, and recently noticed black specks (possibly seeds) in my stool.

I've been told this is probably anxiety, but I find it hard to believe since it's constant, every single day, and never happened before the alcohol incident. The only similar experience I've had is sometimes getting shortness of breath for a few hours after drinking coffee. My stress tolerance has drastically decreased, if I get even slightly scared, I feel like I'm going to faint.

Tests completed (all normal):

* Echocardiogram
* ECG
* Blood analysis
* Evaluation by a cardiologist who said symptoms are ""subjective""

Interestingly, two things have helped somewhat:

1. Probiotics seemed to improve my symptoms
2. A herbal supplement containing passion flower, valerian, lemon balm, California poppy, and melatonin also reduced symptoms

I've been looking into acetaldehyde sensitivity and the connection between alcohol, mucosal barrier damage, and chronic symptoms. Could this be a case where the alcohol triggered acetaldehyde buildup that damaged my mucosal barriers, leading to systemic effects including breathing issues and dry mouth?

I tried to start exercising to deal with the symptoms but could barely manage 2 minutes of HIIT on the first day. I also wake up with dry mouth every single morning.

---------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to escaping the hustle and bustle of daily life, investing in a cabin kit can be a game changer. Specifically, a 24x40 cabin kit offers numerous benefits that make it an excellent choice for your weekend getaway. You can enjoy more than just a retreat; you can create a comfortable and functional space that suits your lifestyle and preferences.

The first thing to consider is the affordability of a 24x40 cabin kit. Compared to traditional homes, cabin kits often provide a cost-effective solution. They are pre-designed structures that save you both time and money during the building process. By eliminating the need for extensive custom designs, you focus on the essential elements that matter most for your getaway. This allows you to allocate more of your budget to decorating and furnishing your cabin according to your taste.

Another significant benefit is the versatility offered by a 24x40 cabin kit. This size allows for multiple layout possibilities. Whether you want an open concept living area, separate bedrooms, or an additional room for guests, you can customize the interior to fit your needs. You could create a cozy retreat for two or even accommodate a larger family gathering. The spaciousness of 24x40 also allows for easy movement and comfort without feeling cramped.

When you choose a cabin kit, it allows for simple assembly, making the process straightforward. Most kits come with detailed instructions and pre-cut materials, making them accessible to even those with minimal construction experience. You might even invite friends or family to join in on the assembly day, turning it into a fun and memorable experience. This DIY aspect can help you feel more connected to your getaway space, knowing you played a part in its creation.

Cabin kits are also excellent for those who value energy efficiency. Many designs come with insulation options that keep the cabin warm during winter and cool in summer. By focusing on energy-efficient materials, a 24x40 cabin can significantly reduce your utility bills over time. This aspect not only makes the cabin more economical but also environmentally friendly. You get to enjoy your weekend retreat while minimizing your carbon footprint.

Here are several additional advantages of a 24x40 cabin kit:

- **Quality Materials:** Many companies offer high-quality wood and materials that enhance durability.
- **Easy Access:** Many cabin kits are designed for rural or remote locations, allowing you to escape urban surroundings easily.
- **Comfortable Living:** Enough space for a kitchen, living room, and sleeping areas ensures you can live comfortably during your stay.
- **Strong Resale Potential:** Investing in a cabin can also be a smart long-term investment, as cabin getaways have become increasingly popular.

Location is another critical aspect of your cabin getaway. A 24x40 cabin kit can be conveniently placed in scenic areas like woods, mountains, or even lakesides, helping you reconnect with nature. Proximity to various outdoor activities—like hiking, fishing, or skiing—further enhances your weekend experience. Imagine waking up to the sounds of birds chirping and the scent of pine trees in the morning. Your cabin can serve as a peaceful sanctuary where you can unwind and recharge.

In addition, a cabin kit allows you to embrace a simpler lifestyle. With fewer distractions and a focus on nature, your weekends can be spent enjoying quality time with family and friends. You can partake in activities that enhance well-being, such as reading a book on the porch, gathering around a fire pit, or simply soaking in the beauty of your surroundings. No longer will you feel burdened by daily chores; instead, your time can be spent enjoying life’s simple pleasures.

A 24x40 cabin kit not only offers a getaway but also an opportunity for creativity. You can personalize your decorations, DIY projects, and even landscaping. This allows your cabin to be a true reflection of you, enhancing the joy you feel during each visit. You might find inspiration for your home décor or gardening ideas that bring your dream getaway to life. Each cabin story will become unique with your stamp, making it a cherished place for years.

Choosing a 24x40 cabin kit for your weekend getaway comes with countless advantages. From affordability and customizability to energy efficiency and location flexibility, the benefits make it an appealing option. You can create a unique retreat designed to bring relaxation and joy into your life, allowing for memorable adventures every weekend. So why wait? Your perfect cabin escape is just a kit away!

How to Customize Your 24x40 Cabin Kit for Ultimate Comfort and Style
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose a 24x40 cabin kit for your getaway, you're investing in a space that can become uniquely yours. Customizing your cabin not only enhances your comfort but also adds your personal style. Here are some effective strategies to make your cabin a perfect retreat.

### Layout Considerations

The layout of your cabin is the foundation of how you will use the space. Consider these essential tips for optimizing your floor plan:

- **Open Concept Living:** Use an open floor plan to create a spacious feel. Combining the kitchen, dining, and living area can make your cabin perfect for entertaining.
- **Maximize Natural Light:** Position windows strategically to bring in as much light as possible. Large picture windows or sliding glass doors create a warm ambience and connect you to nature outside.
- **Functional Areas:** Designate specific zones for relaxation and activities. Whether it’s a cozy reading nook or a game area, ensure that each space flows harmoniously.

### Choose Quality Materials

Investing in quality materials can greatly enhance your cabin’s comfort and aesthetic appeal. Here are some materials to consider:

- **Wood Finishes:** Opt for wooden floors and furnishings that provide a classic cabin feel. Pine, cedar, or oak can add warmth and timeless beauty.
- **Insulation:** Proper insulation will keep your cabin comfortable year-round. Consider materials that are energy-efficient and sustainable.
- **Countertops:** Choose durable, easy-to-clean materials like quartz or granite for your kitchen and bathroom areas.

### Interior Design Elements

Creating a cohesive interior design will enhance your cabin’s atmosphere. Here are ways to add your personal touch:

- **Color Palette:** Select a color scheme that resonates with you. Earthy tones, like greens and browns, can help integrate your cabin with the surrounding environment.
- **Furnishing:** Choose furniture that suits both comfort and style. Soft sofas, plush rugs, and unique decorative pieces can make your space inviting.
- **Art and Decor:** Incorporate artwork or personal collections that reflect your interests. This could include nature photos, local crafts, or even pieces from travels.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

Your 24x40 cabin kit gives you ample opportunities to enjoy the outdoors. Customized outdoor areas can enhance your cabin experience:

- **Decks and Patios:** Build a deck or patio for enjoying morning coffee or evening gatherings. Furnish it with comfortable seating and perhaps a dining set.
- **Fire Pits:** Create an outdoor fire pit for cozy nights under the stars. It’s perfect for marshmallow roasting and storytelling.
- **Landscaping:** Choose low-maintenance native plants that complement your cabin without the need for constant care.

### Smart Technology Integration

Modernizing your cabin with smart technology can make your stay even more comfortable. Consider these technologies:

- **Smart Thermostats:** Keep your cabin at an ideal temperature effortlessly by installing a smart thermostat that adjusts heating and cooling based on your schedule.
- **Wireless Speakers:** Set up a sound system for playing music or enjoying movies. Wireless speakers can help maintain a clutter-free environment.
- **Security Systems:** Enhance safety with smart locks and cameras that allow you to monitor your cabin remotely.

Personalizing a 24x40 cabin kit transforms it from a mere structure to a sanctuary that reflects your taste and meets your needs. By considering layout, materials, interior design, outdoor spaces, and smart technology, you can create an environment that is both aesthetically pleasing and remarkably comfortable. Your getaway will not only be a place to escape but also a true reflection of yourself—where elegance meets comfort in every corner.

### Conclusion

Opting for a 24x40 cabin kit for your weekend getaway is a choice that promises both affordability and flexibility. The ample space provided in these kits makes them perfect for family trips, romantic retreats, or even a solo escape into nature. With a well-thought-out layout, you can easily designate areas for sleeping, relaxing, and enjoying meals, making your getaway experience both comfortable and enjoyable.

When it comes to customization, the possibilities are endless. You can infuse your cabin with personal style by selecting the finishes, colors, and furnishings that resonate with you. Whether you prefer a rustic vibe with wooden accents or a modern look with sleek designs, customizing your cabin ensures that it will feel like a true home away from home. Adding amenities like a cozy fireplace or an outdoor deck can further enhance your retreat, allowing you to soak in the beauty of your surroundings.

Ultimately, a 24x40 cabin kit is not just a structure; it’s an opportunity to create lasting memories. Every time you visit your getaway, you’ll be reminded of the joy and relaxation it brings. With the potential for customization and a solid foundation to build upon, your cabin getaway can be a peaceful sanctuary that rejuvenates your spirit. So why wait?

Recently my dad tried to plan a coffee date between me him and my siblings and I told him I didn't like coffee resulting in him getting angry, I know it might not have been good to shut him down but after 13+ years of trying to build a relationship with him I recently gave up on trying seeing that it's one sided, for context my father is an alcoholic and has major health issues because of it

COVID time my father who didn't want to take the vaccine shots for work decided he wanted to quit his job due to it harming his mental health... He made almost 2mil a year in our currency which gave us a very comfortable life style.. after leaving he focused on his hobby and it brought in money, I will always resent him for leaving his job because when he did my mother had to get two extra jobs to cover basic costs while my father does almost nothing besides drinking and play games through out the day

Around 2022 his heath got worse and he was not constantly in bed, not eating or drinking anything but alcohol so bad he'd be asleep multiple days this would continue for almost a full year before my mom made him go to the doctor, the doctor had told him due to the alcohol his liver was swollen 200% bigger then it's supposed to be and if he didn't change habits fast he could die in 2-4 months, and me as a kid who had recently moved schools twice in the past two years made my mental health crash, luckily I had new friends to support me, through this...

 Eventually my dad got better but as he got better the more my parents started to argue, little background me and my dad never had a relationship due to him never being home when I was little and he was always drinking or at work, due to there never being a bond and my dad telling me my whole life ""we use to be so close"" I thought I was the one in the wrong, until my mom one day told me when I was a baby my dad would leave me alone at hole to go drink at bars while my mom was working, until my mom found out so then my aunt started to look after me...

 Jump back to more present times As a family we had Friday family night which my dad usually had 100 excuse like he wasn't feeling well or he was tired, or he didn't feel like it, so it would end up being my mom and siblings playing and having fun, my dad's only way of trying to spend time with us was with cooking. He loves to cook but it often ended in fight if we tried cooking with him because he treated us like sue chefs instead just having fun, he never wanted to do what we wanted to do so much so we have up on asking, if we wanted to watch a movie with him and he got bored he'd get up and leave not coming back making it pointless to ask, as I got older I got into more fights with him and my mom making me feel trapped and having no one to go to 

flash to more recent events, I feel bad when I say I love you to him, or when he says it and I don't say it back. because I know I don't mean it because I dont feel a connection anymore plus I don't try and spend time with my father anymore i had given up around last year deciding that he might be my blood and has the title of father but he will never be my dad as he was never there for me when I needed him, 

so that's what my argument with my mom was that I was giving up too easily and I'm being difficult and it'll never work out because of me, but I've tried for my whole life 15 years I've tried to fix our relationship so why is it suddenly my fault when I give up and he's giving it a shot, I never needed my father and I don't need him now, I understand he wants to try but I don't trust his tries as they'll never end up happening anyway. I may be pessimistic but like I said, I know my father I know how he is, he cares more about the bottle then his children, it's something I've learned to accept. Through out my child hood alot made me not want to try anymore due to him being emotionally abusive calling me fat as a young kid saying I'd die at 12. These as small examples... I like to say people can change but only the people that want to. The day he puts down the bottle is the day I'll say fuck it and try again to build something.

1jyda4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1jyda4g/does_javy_coffee_have_protein_in_it/,Does Javy coffee have protein in it?,"I've seen a few questions floating around about **Javy coffee**, especially regarding its protein content. As someone who’s constantly on the hunt for easy, nutritious morning routines, I decided to test out **Javy Protein Coffee** for myself. After drinking it regularly for a month, I thought I'd share my honest experience and clarify exactly what's inside this stuff, since the **Javy coffee ingredients** intrigued me enough to give it a shot.

**What Exactly is Javy Protein Coffee?**

Right off the bat: yes, **Javy coffee protein** is actually a thing, and it genuinely includes protein. Specifically, each two-scoop serving contains around 20 grams of premium whey protein. To put it simply, it’s real coffee combined with protein powder—except it doesn’t taste or feel like your average protein shake.

I first learned about it through a bunch of positive **Javy coffee reviews** online, and curiosity got the better of me. I ordered mine directly through their site ([**here’s the link if you’re curious**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JGN6WHK/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)).

**How’s the Taste and Texture?**

I chose the Caramel flavor because, let's face it, caramel coffee sounds delicious. One of my main concerns was whether it would taste chalky or gritty like other protein coffees I've tried before. Surprisingly, this wasn’t an issue. It dissolved smoothly into cold milk (I prefer oat milk), with no clumps at all. The flavor itself was mild and enjoyable—not overly sweet, just a pleasant coffee flavor with a subtle hint of caramel. Not exactly café-quality espresso, but way better than typical protein supplements.

**Energy Levels and Protein Benefits**

Before switching to Javy, my mornings usually involved regular coffee that left me jittery, followed by a mid-morning energy crash. With **Javy protein coffee**, I noticed my energy levels were a lot more stable. The caffeine was balanced out by the protein content, so the energy boost lasted longer without the anxious feeling or crash.

I also appreciated the protein boost, since I'm often rushing around in the morning and don't have time for a full breakfast. Having 20 grams of protein right away helped keep hunger at bay, and I found myself snacking less throughout the morning. This turned out to be one of the nicest surprises from switching to Javy.

**Digestive Effects and Other Benefits**

Another bonus was the addition of prebiotics listed among the **Javy coffee ingredients**. Within about two weeks, I noticed less bloating and overall improved digestion. It’s subtle, but definitely noticeable over time, likely due to fewer sugary coffee beverages and more nutritional balance.

I even took their quick quiz online ([**here’s the quiz if you want to try it**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JGN6WHK/?uid=34951&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)), which helped me choose the right version for my daily habits.

**Is It Worth the Price?**

At around $30 per bag, initially, Javy seemed pricey. But after breaking down the cost, it actually came out cheaper than buying daily coffees from cafés—around $1.50 per serving compared to my usual $5 latte habit. After a month, I definitely noticed the savings add up.

**Any Negatives to Consider?**

It wouldn’t be fair not to mention a couple downsides. Hardcore coffee lovers might miss the complex flavor of fresh-brewed coffee, as Javy uses instant Arabica coffee. Also, it contains whey protein, which includes a tiny amount of lactose, so if you're severely lactose intolerant, be mindful of that.

**Final Thoughts: Does It Actually Deliver Protein?**

Yes, it does! Not only does **Javy Protein Coffee** deliver on protein content, but it tastes surprisingly good and provided steady energy without the crash.

""Are you insane!?""

""It is an order directly from the Dean and backed by the seal of the crown, we would be insane for not following this order Tiberus!""

""But to release the Amethyst dragon!? The beast would sooner tear us apart, there is no guarantee it would do as the Dean predicts Casus!""

""Be that as it may we would be dead man walking either way if we do not follow these orders.""

""HEM protect us..""

Both guards would pull enchanted keys from a cord around their necks, looking to one another before nodding and inserting the keys into their respective locks, twisting the keys at the same time.  
A chime would play 3 times before with the rumble of moving boulders the cage of the Amethyst dragon starts to open, the beast not waiting for the opening to be wide enough as it bashes against the cell door, scraping the enchanted and conventionally reinforced door against the ground and lifting the pins out of their hinges, the heavy door crashing to the floor as the dragon roars.

Its jaws snapping shut around one of the guards as he tries to flee, leaving just his lower half to tumble to the ground on his last momentum, the other guard standing as still as he can hoping against all odds to not attract the Amethyst dragons ire.

The beast seemign to either enjoy the last guard pissing himself from how scared he is of it, or simply not bothering with the shaking guard as it starts clawing its way out, tunneling through the ceiling to get out into the town of Elaseer.

""May HEM preserve us all..."" is what the last guard standing mutters to himself before passing out from the adrenaline crash.

Having completed our outfitting for the academy uniforms far ahead of the other students this year, Emma having made quite the bold statement with the cloak she had made to wear over her armor. I do believe Emma said she had designed it herself and simply shared her notes, much to the delight of the tailors apprentice that was chosen to work on Emma's commision.

Angel appears to have also gotten a cloak, tho the design is striking and rather unorthodox, the flowing gray silken fabric reminiscent more of a robe than a hooded cloak, inlaid with fine golden threads depicting strange emblems, most are geometric yet several are clearly important to Angel for reasons I cannot grasp.  
one of the embles tho I recognise, as it is on Tower, Angel, the black Legionary, Nemo, and Emma for some reason.. perhaps it is the heraldry of the Legion.  
another appears to be a winged elf with arms spread, acompanied by a hooded figure with a skull for a face wielding a large reaping scythe and an armored soldier holding a shield almost as large as them. there are words embroidened below the trio of figures yet I do not know what language it is.

As I muse on what might be the meaning behind the words and the emblems my thoughts are interrupted by a sudden quake, something that should not happen as Elaseer should not be anywhere near the border of two adjacent realms.

Turning to Thalmin as his ears are quite a few times more capable as mine, he gives me a look of concern.  
Something is happening and neither of us likes what it is nor knows what it will be, I can only hope Emma will be alright should it prove to be a catastrophy.

Transgracia

With quite the violent emergence the Amethyst dragon crawls out of the now thuroughly ruined warehouse that was build above where it was kept, roaring loudly as it spreads its wings and takes flight, it's massive bulk quite hard to miss.

Ofcourse the Legion forces having already been keeping an eye on the town would react as one would expect an armed force to do when you are suddenly face with a flying tank, the 4 squadrons of Vultures changing course to intercept the Amethyst dragon.

(you may now start playing the song\~)

As the first pair of Vultures gets within range they perform a gunrun on the dragon, the shells hitting the Amethyst dragons side, shattering crystals and digging into its hide yet not doing sufficient damage to down the beast, it lashes out as the lead Vulture flies past it, claws rending open the cockpit and prying open the light armor plating from nose to tail, fuel lines ruptured and catching fire from sparking wires as the Vulture spins out of control. Its pilot dead, either crushed by the dragons claws before he could harmonize or harmonizing after his cockpit canopy was torn apart.

The struck Vulture turning into a spinning fireball as it wizzes past the towns belltower and violently crashes into a field just outside the town, creating quite the fireball as the remaining fuel ignites all at once and cooks off the still unfired munitions.

Using the plentifull mana that surrounds it the Amethyst dragon envelops itself in a barrier, the crystals covering its tough scaled hide shimmering as the dragon uses them as a spell focus.  
Summoning a sizable amethyst crystal the dragon would launch it at the next pair of Vultures lining up for their attack run.

the lead Vulture of this pair rolling out of the way and popping flares, yet its wingman couldn't react in time. The man sized crystal hitting the Vultures nose and tearing through the fusalage, the sheer impact shattering the crystal and sending magically sharpened shrapnel hurling into the engine intakes and shredding the internals, shattering compressor blades as the additional shrapnel causes a cascade failure.  
The Vultures engines dying with a pathetic whine as the cockpit was torn open, the pilot harmonized as aerodynamics forces the Vulture to glide crash into Elaseers belltower.

The remaining 6 Vultures break off their attack runs and start circling high above the dragon, hidden weapons bays within the wings sliding open as 2 missiles fall away from each Vulture, the 12 missiles homing in on the Amethyst dragon, RADAR seekers active and locked onto the dragon as its crystals start to glow.

The Amethyst dragon deploying its own counter measures, sensing the not quite mana of the RADAR seekers it sends out a pulse of mana, scrambling the missiles seeker and onboard guidence, making the missiles slam into each other. detonating a healthy distance away from the dragon.

With the top attack missile strike failing the Vultures retreat back to the Harbinger, the hybrid carrier vessel turning to face the Amethyst dragon head on. It's massive model 3 particle accalerator cannon humming ominously as it charges up to fire. the prow starting to excude a bright cyan mist, white arcs of raw power lashing from the cannons barrel to the hull plating on the prow, slagging individual hull plates as the oversized particle accelerator overclocks to charge faster.

Being smart enough to know better than to stay infront of the Harbinger the Amethyst dragon would let itself loose altitude, falling away from the vessels arc of fire and forcing the Harbinger to adjust by mabouvering the entire vessel as the model 3 runs from prow to stern throughout the entire vessel.

Having had the dragon in its crosshairs for all of 2 seconds the Harbinger fires, a beam of bright cyan light hammering into the Amethyst dragons barrier, narrowly missing the dragon itself as the barrier shatters and the dragon dives out of the way, flying low through the main street of Elaseer as its the only street wide enough to accomodate its wingspan.  
The secondary turrets on the Harbinger coming online and tracking the dragon, opening fire after a short delay and driving 120mm shells into the paved street around the speeding dragon, each impact cratering the street and kicking up dust and debrie as the dragon keeps flying in a straight line due to the street being but a straight line, the residents homes providing just enough cover and keeping the Legion vessel from doing a saturation bombardment.

R3D33M3R moving in to face the Dragon head on as it charges down the street towards it, flames billowing from the exhausts as the venerable tanks engines roar, tracks skipping due to lack of grip in places as the main guns take aim.

The dragon would kick itself off the street and shoot straight up as the tank fires, the two 150mm shells wizzing past both sides of its head and missing the dragon as it pulls up, hitting the alread battered bell tower far behind it, Harbinger readying for another shot as the Amethyst dragon gathers mana again, creating a sizable chunk of Amethyst and using it as sacrifical armor when the Harbingers 20mm point defence net opens fire, tearing into the the crystal but buying the dragon time to roll out of the way of and stay ahead of the stream of tracer fire chasing its tail.

Harbinger adjusting its aim as the dragon moves across its starboard side, the big main gun turret rotating into position as the ship attempts to turn with the dragon and get a clear shot.  
the 2400mm howitzer firing with a the shell leaving the barrel causing a thunderclap of a shockwave that clears the prow of dust and particulate, the shells aim is true and it hits the dragon between the wings, but the proximity fuse fails due to the dragons interference, the shells 1750kg high explosive filler not detonating as a result, merely knocking the dragon out of the sky and forcing it to crash land into the adventurers guild building.

Crawling out of the hole it created the dragon roars defiantly and launches a chunk of amethyst the size of itself at the Harbinger, point defence doing what it can to chip away at the massive crystal but only managing to reduce it to a quarter by the time it impacts the starboard side, ripping a massive hole into 2 decks and physically swatting the ship back from the impact.

With the Harbinger now wounded and R3D33M3R speeding towards it the Amethyst dragon takes flight again and makes its escape, flying away from the town as R3D33M3R's hull mounted 40mm chaingun lets loose a volley of green tracers, the armor piercing darts ripping into the dragons wing but only doing minor overall damage.

By the time the dust settles the dragon is gone, having fled into the Transgracian wilderniss.

==================================================================

ILV-CC 117 Harbinger  
11:50 shipboard time

klaxons blare as bulkheads connecting the breached compartments seal shut, to keep the rest of the ship safe from decompression, or it would if the Harbinger was in the vacuum of space, here within the mana rich Nexus though the standard protocoll provides just as much protection from the dangerous Mana, atleast 40 crewman were present in the exposed compartments, all of them either killed on impact or harmonized shortly there after as their vacuum rated body glove and light armor vest did nothing to protect them from the mana.

Damage control crews rush to the impact zone in bulky armored suits, a fire having broken out as some of the electrical wiring between the 2 decks that were hit got damaged. all non essential personal have evacuated the compartments borering the struck compartments so they may be used as maksehift airlocks, the damage control crews braving the blazzing inferno of mana enhanced fire.

Some unlucky damage control crewman stood too close to a capacitor as it exploded due to the heat of the fire cooking the acid inside. The lucky ones had their helmets breached and died instantly as the mana harmonizes them head first, the unlucky ones die screaming in pain as the mana seeps into their suits, liquifying them slowly from the breech in their suits outwards, unlike Pilot 1, the crew in the struck compartments and the pilots of the downed Vultures who's deaths were quick and relatively painless the damage control crews with damaged suits are aware and concious as the coustic energy rips them apart an inch at a time.

Efforts are made to evacuate those with damaged suits but it proves futile.  
By the time the fire is doused 60 additional crewman have given their lives.

1jyd4ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/Umrah/comments/1jyd4ol/northwest_bus_to_taif_and_flying_from_its_small/,Northwest bus to Taif and flying from its small regional airport instead of Jeddah,"After weeks of searching for return tickets from Jeddah, I decided to try Taif, and fortunately, the prices were reasonable for the trip back home.

I booked an Air Arabia flight, which apparently operates every other day from Sharjah to Taif.

For seven days straight, I haggled with taxi drivers quoting anywhere from 100 to 400 SAR one way. Private taxis were a bit more lenient; one driver, an uncle, brought it down to 130 SAR. But the green taxi guys wouldn’t budge below 200. 

In the end, I couldn’t lock in a solid deal, so I turned to the NorthWest bus website. I’d been trying to book through it for days, but my preferred dates weren’t available.

Alhamdulillah, they finally opened up two weeks before my trip.

I booked my ticket two days before departure, selecting the route from Makkah Jarwal station to Taif Bus Stand. The bus, which continues to Riyadh, cost 40 SAR.

Don’t bother picking seats. They’re not enforced. Women and families sit upfront, while the rest of us take the back. There’s an extra 20 SAR fee for luggage over 25 kg, though they didn’t even weigh mine.

Jarwal station is right behind the Haram. Just take the road toward Sheraton Makkah, and you’ll find it. 

The bus left on time. I had a brief spat with the driver, but I let it go. The bus was mostly empty, so it wasn’t a big deal. He later apologized for being rude when we arrived in Taif, so all’s well.

There are two routes to Taif. 

This one skips the scenic, twisty mountain road, so it’s smooth.. no bumps or squiggles to make you queasy. They estimate a two-hour trip, but you spend most of the first in Makkah and its outskirts.

Luckily the seat next to me was empty, so was the luck of many other passengers. But the seats are rather narrow.

At Taif Bus Stand, you’re swarmed by private taxi drivers the moment you step off. In Saudi, the rule is to ignore them. They don’t give up easily, though. You ignore them again, but they persist. You try one more time, and they call in reinforcements like paparazzi. I stood my ground, made up a story about a friend picking me up (which kinda happened), and they finally backed off.

I took shelter in a coffee shop since my flight was a few hours away. Fendeer Coffee was great.. the kind Indonesian brother let me sit, sip, and charge my phone.

When it was time to leave, I booked an Uber, which arrived instantly. Coming from Makkah, where Ubers are rare, this felt like a breeze. I loaded my luggage into the trunk and hopped in.

I always test if the driver speaks English with a casual “How you doing, brother?” If they respond with a confused “Huh?” I switch to “Kaif Haalak, Alhamdulillah” and stay quiet for the ride. 

But this guy replied, “Pretty good,” in a Western accent. I thought, “Oh, thank you, Lord, he speaks English!” We chatted the whole way, and before I knew it, 22 minutes had flown by.

The Saudis I met on this trip, especially the English-speaking locals, were some of the kindest people, wallahi. May Allah bless them. And I’m not even white /s

Now, Taif airport: small, cozy, beautiful, and regional. You step off the bus, turn right for Zamzam water, walk in to an empty check-in counter, take a left for a quick immigration, pass security, and you’re done. To the right are three little gates—1, 2, 3. 

There’s a small café with sandwiches, coffee, and pastries, plus prayer halls for men and women and a compact lounge. It got a bit crowded later, but it was still smoother than any Jeddah terminal. Loved it.

When we boarded, our plane was the only one on the tarmac. I did a full 360—no other aircraft in sight. Unfortunately, a military drill delayed our flight, but it kept us entertained for half an hour. Khair, no big deal.

I’d definitely fly from Taif again if I get the chance, inshallah. If you have the option, give Taif a shot.",2,1744565634.0,Umrah,0,1.0,False

1jyd26n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyd26n,7 Days Bikepacking in Denmark," What came to me last fall as a crazy idea became reality at the beginning of April: my first ever bikepacking tour - 7 days solo through Denmark.

# The bike

""The best bike is the one you've got"" is something you often read in the comments here in response to the question of which bike you should buy for bikepacking. Some time ago, I equipped my 2014 Cube Attention with frame bags from Evoc and a 10 liter seat pack as well as a snack pouch (both Rhinowalk). Together with a 20 liter Big River Drybag from Sea to Summit, the storage space is more than enough for long tours. The complete packing list and what I unnecessarily dragged along can be found below. All in all, the bike weighed about 30kg without water and food.

For me, the bike is a solid all-rounder; efficient enough on gravel and with sufficient reserves for easy trails. Stamp 1 flat pedals from Crankbrothers, SQLab Inner Bar Ends (game changer!!) and an inexpensive tri attachment from M-Wave.

# Why Denmark?

On the way through to Norway last year, I had a fleeting thought: “Nice place, I should cycle through it”. The fact that I really ended up with Denmark is not only due to the fantastic landscape, but also to the fact that the country offers a perfect infrastructure for bikepacking with almost 2,500 camping sites and shelter s, most of which are free of charge (more on this below). Well-developed cycle paths and 99.5% extremely considerate car drivers are on top.

# Shelter

There are countless shelters in Denmark (e.g. picture 4) where you can spend the night. Most of them are free of charge, a few can be booked in advance, which is especially useful in summer. Most of the shelters I visited were equipped with a fireplace, some even with free firewood. Some of the shelters are located on private land or campsites, and there is often a water tap, shower or electricity nearby. The best way to find shelters is via [https://shelterapp.dk/](https://shelterapp.dk/) \- the shelters can also be filtered via this app and saved as favorites. I have marked all the shelters along my tour in advance and usually decide which one I'm going to visit in the early afternoon.

# The tour

What was originally planned as a more or less direct ride across Denmark (Skagen -> Flensburg, \~420km) slowly escalated during the planning and in the end it became 734km with a little more than 3,000 meters of elevation gain. So I really rode all of the two hills ;) I had divided the total distance into 8 stages of between 80 and 120km.

I took the train from Flensburg to Skagen overnight (8pm - 7am). Naively, I thought I would be able to get some sleep during the four-hour layover in Aalborg - but that wasn't the case, so I spent half the night walking up and down the platform to stay warm. I had already feared that the forecast of 5 - 15° would not materialize.

When I arrived in Skagen, I knew for sure: everything was frozen, an estimated -5° and I was completely under-equipped. **Fuck**.

So I had to grit my teeth for the next few days. The thin rain jacket and trousers quickly kept me warm enough. Nitrile gloves under the thin MTB gloves are incredibly useful and guarantee warm (albeit slightly damp) hands. I say winter gloves are now superfluous for me. Fortunately, it got reliably warmer every day around lunchtime and by the afternoon at the latest, sunscreen was the order of the day.

Before the actual tour started, I had to make a detour to the beach, where the North Sea and Baltic Sea meet. The biting cold, the sound of the waves and cycling along the beach at sunrise - it was awesome.

Then I set off on the first stage. Ideally, I wanted to be at the Rubjerg Knude sand dune on the North Sea coast in the evening to photograph the old lighthouse in the evening light. In between were some beautiful dune landscapes, flowing trails, gravel paths - and, to my surprise, a swamp area. According to Komoot, the paths were supposed to be rideable, although that was a stretch in some cases. Hike-a-bike and slashing through thickets was the order of the day and took a lot of energy. Exhausted, I finally arrived at my shelter southwest of Hjørring, which I had already picked out in advance. The shelter was right next to a private estate in the middle of cultivated fields. Electricity, a hot shower and an underground fridge with cold beer included - although I did without the latter and preferred to close my eyes at 6pm. The night was not restful due to sub-zero temperatures and **a fucking hole in the air mattress**.

Continued towards Rubjerg Knude the next morning and visit the old lighthouse (picture 5). The beach in Løkken with its old bunkers (pictures 6 & 7) is partly rideable. Despite using chain wax instead of oil, sand and salt water are of course the final boss for the drivetrain, so I better gave it a quick rinse immediately and re-waxed it in the evening. The stage destination was Løgstør, but there were still a few kilometers to go, past Aalborg and directly along the water in a westerly direction. The shelter in the evening was chargeable (75 DKK, \~10 EUR), was right next to a playground and therefore had a toilet, (ice-cold) shower and electricity right there. Henning, the friendly Dane in charge of the shelter, told me I was the first visitor this year. I tried to patch the hole in the air mattress with duct tape. I wasn't successful, because I had to re-inflate the air mattress every three hours. Fuck.

The next day I had just over 80 km to cover, including a short ferry ride from Hvalpsund to Sundsøre. The shelter I was originally aiming for was southwest of the town of Skive. However, as I was able to quickly do quite a few kilometers, I was already in Skive by lunchtime. What looked like a city park on Komoot turned out to be a small forest with lots of flowy trails - very welcome! I stopped for lunch at a small hot dog kiosk. The owners kindly offered to refill my water bottles. As it was still quite early in the day, I decided to also ride the next day's stage (also around 80km) - my first Imperial Century, yesss!

However, this was not to be the case, because southwest of Skive there is a beautifully scenic dry area - which is unfortunately difficult to ride (picture 9 - these were by far the best paths there). To make matters worse, not all of the paths marked in Komoot are still available. Bad flashbacks of the swamp area from the first day left me quite frustrated when I had to turn back (again, of course, after some pushing and energy-sapping passages) and look for an alternative route and a new shelter for the night. Too bad about the Imperial Century, I would have really digged it on my >30kg bike.

The choice fell on a small hut on private land to the west of Venø Bay (picture 10). Once there, I stood in front of a nice property and knocked hesitantly on the door to inquire about the shelter. There didn't seem to be anyone there apart from the dog, and just before I set off for the nearest shelter I discovered a note on the door next door (picture 11). Ellen told me on the phone that she and her husband were not home yet, but that I should make myself comfortable and they would come by an hour later to say hello. Super nice people, really! I'm still amazed by their hospitality and openness towards strangers.

The next day, with the wind from the north-west (and therefore a headwind at first), I headed towards the North Sea coast and then south along it. The dune cycle path and Vestkystruten 1 took me about 110km to Hvide Sande. The scenery is top notch and the long straight country roads invite you to make kilometers. Around lunchtime in Hvide Sande, I had to make another decision: Continue for another 50km or take it easy and call it a day? I opted for the latter. A quick visit to the local indoor swimming pool for a shower (to my surprise, the lady at the reception just let me in without paying the entrance fee), a visit to one of the many restaurants for a large pizza and two beers, and then off to the next shelter and an early night.

I actually wanted to set off at half past five the next morning, but as it was still pitch dark, I turned around for another hour. Having learned from my experience with the Danish singletrack trails, I changed the route for the day a little. The route first took me to Varde, north of Esbjerg, again through the dunes and beautiful woodland. The inland from Varde eastwards is very reminiscent of home and has much less to offer than the coastal regions, so today I wanted to go for it and just ride. Surprisingly, the wind had changed and was now coming from the east. At the end of the day, I had 135 km down with a constant headwind. I seem to have got used to it in terms of fitness by now, because the day was not a significant effort, neither in terms of how I felt nor according to my Garmin. Average heart rate of around 120, wtf. I usually have that after brushing my teeth. I shared the shelter site with a total of three shelters and another hut with a fire pit (penultimate picture) with two friendly hikers who had done 35km that day. The nearby farm offered a public toilet, water and electricity.

 I don't want to say that my ass really hurt by now. But I was very glad I had packed **two** chapsticks. IYKYK.

In the meantime, I had decided to split up the rest of the route so that, together with the time advantage I had already achieved, I would be back exactly one day earlier than planned. So the next morning I set off for Vejle, continuing towards Fredericia and Middelfart on the island of Fyn. My destination was a shelter somewhere “just” before the ferry from Bøjden to Fynshav. In the afternoon, the choice fell on a paid shelter on the edge of a campsite (last picture) with a direct view of Helnæs Bay - kitchen, shower and so on on the campsite included, of course. I felt I had earned this luxury for my last overnight stay. The shelter itself, with its hinged door and round holes in the wall, somehow reminded me of a transport box for cats.

Due to the proximity to the water, it was of course very cold. The next morning, the hinged door of my shelter was frozen from the inside. Phew. Nevertheless (or perhaps because of this?), the first order of business of the day was to take a dip in the bay, please! 5 minutes in the ice-cold water, and then a nice shower. A final coffee at the campsite from the trusty enamel cup, and off I went in the direction of Bøjden. I'd got a bit bogged down by the dip in the bay and still wanted to catch the 11 a.m. ferry to avoid having to wait two hours. So I floored and cursed the unexpected hills in the south-east of Denmark. The last car rolls onto the ferry, I roll to the ticket machine and then follow. 10:58 a.m., precision landing!

From Fynshav, the journey continued at a leisurely pace towards Flensburg. The last stretch offered another scenic highlight and a lot of fun riding the Gendarmenpfad.

1jyd0y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContentCreators/comments/1jyd0y6/i_built_fundhog_a_crypto_donation_button_for/,"I Built Fundhog: A Crypto Donation Button for Creators (Like Ko-fi, but Web3!)","Hey r/ContentCreators!

I’m thrilled to share FundHog, a tool I made to help creators like us get crypto donations directly from fans—no middleman stealing the show! Think Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee, but with Ethereum, Polygon, and other chains, plus a button builder to make it your vibe. If you’ve got a website, blog, or portfolio, this could be a fun way to monetize in 2025’s crypto wave. Here’s why I’m excited!

What’s Fundhog?

Fundhog lets you add a slick donation button to your site in minutes. Fans send crypto (ETH, MATIC, etc.) straight to your wallet—I don’t touch a penny, so you keep max support. It’s perfect for YouTubers, streamers, artists, podcasters, or anyone with a following wanting to try Web3 monetization.

Why Crypto for Creators?

Crypto’s borderless, has low fees (especially on Polygon), and feels futuristic. 

With Fundhog, you can tap global fans without PayPal’s cuts or delays. Plus, it’s transparent—every donation’s on-chain. I built this to make crypto as easy as fiat for creators, no PhD required!

Features You’ll Love

* Button Builder: Design your button to match your brand. Pick text (“Buy me a coffee” or “Support my art”), colors (I’m loving #EC4899 pink), sizes (small, medium, large), and shapes (sharp or rounded). No coding needed—it’s drag-and-drop easy.
* No Middleman: Donations go wallet-to-wallet. Fundhog just sets up the connection, keeping it secure.
* Super Simple Embed: Add it to your site with a quick code snippet. Here’s one I made:

&#8203;

    <div id=""crypto-coffee-button""></div> <script>   window.cryptoCoffeeConfig = {     ""text"": ""Buy me a coffee"",     ""color"": ""#EC4899"",     ""size"": ""md"",     ""borderRadius"": ""md"",     ""amount"": ""0.01"",     ""recipientAddress"": ""0x144d216d505de96a4d60336a5cab0b22772b0102""   }; </script> <script src=""https://www.fundhog.xyz/embed.js""></script>

* Light & Safe: The script’s tiny (\~1KB), loads fast, and uses a secure iframe so donations are legit.
* Multi-Chain Support: Works with MetaMask or similar wallets on Ethereum, Polygon, and more. It auto-detects the fan’s chain for a smooth tip.

How It Helps You

* Streamers: Add a “Tip in Crypto” button to your Twitch landing page.
* Artists: Let fans support your portfolio with ETH or MATIC.
* Bloggers/Podcasters: Pop it on your site for a “Buy me a coffee” vibe, but Web3-style.
* Any Creator: If you’ve got a site, you can start collecting crypto love!

How to Start

1. Swing by [fundhog.xyz](https://www.fundhog.xyz) and create a button.
2. Play with the button builder—make it scream you.
3. Paste the code into your site (WordPress, Squarespace, HTML, whatever).
4. Fans click, connect their wallet, and send crypto directly to you.

Why I’m Sharing? I’m a creator too, and I got tired of platforms eating my earnings. 

Fundhog’s my way of giving us a fresh option: direct, fun, and crypto-powered. It’s v1, so I’m stoked to hear what you think! 

Would you use this? Want Solana or custom fonts in the builder? Got other monetization tricks you love?Check out the demo on [fundhog.xyz](https://www.fundhog.xyz), or DM me if you’ve got questions. 

What’s your go-to for fan support—Ko-fi, Patreon, or something else? Let’s swap ideas! Thanks for reading, and hope Fundhog sparks some Web3 magic for your content!",1,1744565373.0,ContentCreators,1,1.0,False

Not out of hurt nor frustration, nor out of being angry and resentment. But he did something today that made me realize how well he treats me.

When we woke up this morning, nagmamadali sya nagpalit ng damit habang ako nililigpit yung kalat namin last night dahil nagpa-house party kami. Sabi nya bibili lang sya ng food namin kasi naubos yung food and snacks namin sa house party. Pagbalik nya, iniwan lang yung pinamili nya sa table tapos dumiretso sa second bedroom namin na ginagamit namin as home office at nag lock sya dun. Kinakatok ko sya pero di sumasagot. As someone who has been cheated on a lot, my mind went spiraling to worst case scenario. OA, oo alam ko.

Paglabas nya, ang laki ng ngiti nya at sobrang excited sya. Sabi pa nya, top secret kung ano ginawa nya sa room. Umupo na sya sa dining table habang nagtitimpla pa ko ng coffee namin. Bigla nya tinanong if prefer ko ba makuha ang birthday present in advance, or sa mismong birthday ko na. Pumasok ulit sa home office at nilabas yung malaking paperbag na di ko napansin kung saan galing. Tuwang tuwa sya nung inabot nya saken.

Pagbukas ko, nakita ko yung Jabra headset na ilang beses ko na pinagiisipan bilhin, pero di ko macheck out kasi sobrang mahal (Evolve2 85) at nanghihinayang ako sa presyo. Hindi ko alam pano nya nalaman na gusto ko bilhin yun. Pero alam nya na nahihirapan ako dun sa dalawang existing na headset ko. Pinakita nya din sakin na nagbook na sya ng out of town trip namin for 5 days para sa mismong birthday ko, pati yung tickets ng attraction na gustong gusto ko puntahan. And he said, ""Soon you will meet and be my family, and you will know what it is like to have a warm and welcoming family.""

Na-realize ko na kahit 3 months pa lang kami, sobrang inaalagan nya ko at sinusupport sa kung ano gusto kong gawin. Naiiyak ako, sobrang saya ko today and realized na I have finally found someone who is really good to me, and wants me to do well for me, so I get back my autonomy na nawala sa family ko.",12,1744565365.0,OffMyChestPH,2,0.93,False

I'm happy eating the same few things, I go out to eat on occasion but always stick to the one thing I always get at restaurants (usually some type of tofu or veggie dish).

I've always been weird with textures, but recently I feel like its gotten worse. Just last night I was seconds away from having a break down over some kind of soft texture that sent me over the edge. I believe it was tofu or some kind of konjac noodle ive had before. I spit it out and spent 10mins trying to get the taste and feeling of it from my mouth. I was too scared to eat anything soft after that. I still haven't. 

The last few months have been brutal. I've been anxious about lots of things, the way food looks, how it tastes, smells, textures, even the way it moves. It all determines if I'll eat it or not.

All I can eat right now is >!a specific kind of protein bar, coffee, or some kinds of fruit!<

There's a lot of anxiety about food cross contamination (especially with meat), too. Which didn't used to be as big of a deal last year. I can't even wash some of the dishes my friends use thst I know have touched meat. Yes, even with thick dish gloves on.

I will be in Vienna for a few days in September on a business trip (until Thursday afternoon). I'm thinking of extending my trip until Sunday to spend a few days somewhere nearby (more or less). However, I will have to fly back from Vienna on Sunday evening at the latest. So I'm thinking of somewhere 2-3 hours away by train.

I love walking for hours, light hiking, and soaking up the feel of a place. I’m not really into museums or guided tours — I prefer being outdoors, wandering through interesting neighbourhoods, old towns, riversides, parks, or nature trails. I also enjoy looking at beautiful architecture, but I don’t need to go inside — the same goes for castles. I’m perfectly happy admiring them from the outside, ideally with a coffee or glass of wine in hand.

Food is a big part of my travels — I enjoy discovering local cuisine, bakeries, markets, street food, and casual spots like beer gardens or wine taverns. I’ll be travelling solo and won’t be renting a car, so walkability and good public transport are important.

I’ve been considering Bratislava, Brno, Graz, Linz, and Budapest, but I’m open to other suggestions that fit this kind of trip. My budget is moderate — I like to eat well and stay somewhere comfortable, without going over the top.

Here’s what actually helped us.,"You finally get your baby down for a nap, sneak out of the room, maybe even pour yourself a coffee… and boom, they’re awake 30 minutes later. Sound familiar?

Short naps are super common (and frustrating), but the good news is there’s usually a *reason* — and it doesn’t involve letting your baby cry it out.

**What’s causing short naps?**  
Most of the time, it comes down to **wake windows** — either they’re:

* 💤 **Under-tired** (not awake long enough to build enough sleep pressure), or
* 😩 **Overtired** (awake too long, stress hormones kick in and disrupt sleep)

Either way, your baby wakes after *just one* sleep cycle (about 30–45 minutes) and can’t link into the next one.

**So what actually worked for us?**  
Focusing on age-appropriate wake times + solid feeding routines (no cry-it-out involved!). Once we got the wake windows right, naps got longer — like *actually long enough to sit down and breathe*.

Here’s a basic wake window guide:

📌 0–6 weeks → 40–60 min  
📌 6–12 weeks → 60–80 min  
📌 3–7 months → 80–120 min  
📌 7–12 months → 120–180 min

➡️ Pro tip: That first wake window of the day is usually their sleepiest — but try to gently stretch it to the full range to set the tone for better naps.

**Other things that helped us:**

✅ **Full feedings during the day** (not snacking!)  
✅ **Dark nap room + white noise**  
✅ **Cool room temp (68–72°F)**  
✅ **Not jumping in right away** if they wake after 30 mins — sometimes they settle themselves back down after 2–3 mins  
✅ **Limiting motion naps** (stroller, car, etc.) so they can practice linking sleep cycles in the crib

And one thing that was a game-changer: **helping them fall asleep when needed.** If we wait too long and they get overtired, naps are a disaster. Helping them get to sleep on time actually makes it *easier* for them to self-soothe over time.

**Bottom line:**  
If short naps are driving you nuts, adjusting your baby’s wake windows and having a consistent (but flexible!) routine can make a huge difference.

I had planned to get the Gaggiamate ASAP but after a couple days using it stock I don’t know if I will… it’s making great cortados! Of course the steaming is better on the SPX but it’s 4x the money, loud and giant. 
So loud.

About 2 month ago I went to see a homeopath as I have been struggling with various things. One of the things is a decade long struggle with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. I was given Nat Mur 10 drops under my tongue. The issue is the pmdd seems to have worsened tremendously. I'm not sure if this is what supposed to happen and in time it'll get better but I was expecting more. It was my first time seeing a homeopath and the reason I was given the Nat mur wasn't explained or if there are other things I shouldn't be taking with it. I have a cup of  coffee  everyday and occasionally drink alcohol. Could these have affected my results with Nat mur. 
Pmdd is probably the worst thing I go through and I was really hoping for something good to come of this. Any guidance and advice would be highly appreciated. Thank you for reading.",1,1744564549.0,homeopathy,2,1.0,False

The fact that it’s compatible with both Nespresso pods and ground espresso seems super convenient.

The hands-free frother also looks like a nice touch for making lattes at home without too much fuss.

That said… I haven’t seen much discussion about this machine here. Anyone actually used it?

* How’s the espresso quality?
* Does the milk frother actually get hot enough?
* Is it reliable long-term or more of a “looks cool but wears out fast” type of thing?

We started living together since we have the same workplace to save on rent. He has a higher salary than me and yet im the only one who’s able to have savings and extra money to spend on my wants. 

He has been borrowing money from me and yes, he does pay on time but what frustrates me is that I always pay for our dates, our meals and coffee. 

Just today, I told him to pay me when our salary arrives since i needed to send my mom money for our cats and then I found out he owes his appstore money from his in app purchase on a game and on top of that he owe one of our workmate money since he bought a very expensive cap. Our salary is not that big since we work in the hospitality industry and I tried to budget his salary by calculating everything (rent, gas, utilities, laundry, what he owes his friend, what he owes from appstore and what he owes me) and whats left was a meager 1000 pesos. 

So he will probably turn the cycle again and borrow money if that 1000 runs out. I’m really frustrated since im saving money to buy something very important soon and yet my savings kept on depleting and just this month I took out 50% of my allowance to cover for his necessities.

I’ve already talked to him about it and yet he wont even talk to me and kept on watching reels on his phone while i talk my heart out because of my frustration. His only answer is that Im very noisy and stayed silent while he continued watching reels on his phone.

I cant talk to anyone since we both have the same circle of friends and im getting more and more frustrated because of his financial irresponsibility. ",0,1744564507.0,OffMyChestPH,2,0.5,False

1jycmve,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1jycmve/the_substitute/,The Substitute,"Mr. Hadley wasn’t anyone’s favorite teacher.

He was mean as a snake. A harsh grader. He’d go off on tangents about topics that were *way* too hard for a sixth-grade class to understand, pause, glare at us like we were stinking up the room, and say, “well, those of you who’ll make it to college *might* learn more about that someday.” He smelled musty, like burnt coffee and old food, and he was more often than not wearing a putrid wool sweater that made me itch just looking at it. He was one of the older teachers at Moreland Middle School—at least he *looked* older, with dorky round glasses and six whole strands of hair—and seemed to deeply resent teaching a class of 12-year-olds with 12-year-old brains.

I was sitting next to Lisa Greene when the test thudded onto my desk. *C-.* I sighed in relief. Lisa glanced over, holding her chin high as she awaited her own test. I tried not to feel inferior as I flipped through the pages, cringing at all the questions that had been marked up in red ink.

Look, it’s not like I was a slacker. Mr. Hadley’s tests were *ridiculous*. He’d had to change them after a few parents complained about the “non-standard content”, and after that he *did* start to follow the standard curriculum, at least, but he still worded things like a sphinx, like he was hoping we’d pick the wrong letter and fall down some secret trapdoor. We’d all heard him grumbling about how “the world wasn’t built for geniuses” and he'd be damned if he was going to “help mediocrity prosper” like the rest of the teachers at Moreland.

The other teachers didn’t like him very much. Shocker, I know. Not even Mrs. Caruso, the English teacher, got along with him, and she didn’t have a mean bone in her body.

I wondered if Hadley had always hated the job so much. I couldn’t imagine a past version of him who didn’t enjoy tormenting children. As much as he already sucked, I swear that he was getting *worse.* Over the last few weeks, he’d been coming into class crankier than ever, and looking exhausted, too. He’d stopped bothering with combing back the six strands haloing his mirrorball head, and he actually wore the puke sweater for 11 days straight (I knew because I kept tallies in my science notebook).

He even yelled at Lisa when she asked a question about mitosis. A stunned silence fell over the class. For a moment, Hadley looked guilty, then his mouth twisted like he tasted something sour and he turned away from the crestfallen girl.

I don’t remember what I was doing on that Thursday evening. Playing video games, then homework, probably. It was probably an ordinary night for everyone except for Hadley. I still wonder what happened that night after he got into his car and drove home.

On Friday morning, he came in a changed man.

A changed man, *with* *candy*. The good stuff, too. Full-size chocolate bars. Instead of pulling up his usual lecture, he turned to us and said, “Good day to you all, my lovely students! Today’s no ordinary day, so why would we have an ordinary class? We’re going to watch a movie!”

I didn’t need to look around the class to sense the astonishment. Was this some kind of cruel trick?

You could hear a pin drop as he put on Osmosis Jones and handed out candy bars from a giant bag, humming cheerily all the time. I broke mine in half before eating to make sure there wasn’t anything nasty in there—nope. Just caramel and nougat.

I kept looking over at Hadley every few minutes from my safe position in the back right corner of the room. He was smiling gleefully behind his desk, his face lit up with an energy that had formerly only been applied to torturing his students. Every so often he’d lean over and scribble something down inside a beaten-up notebook.

That was Friday. The weekend passed with no science homework, for once. Then came Monday.

I was in my usual seat at the back corner of the room when Mr. Hadley walked in, but even from that distance I could tell something was very wrong.

He was taller. More upright, at least, like we were seeing him stand up straight for the first time ever. And had he put on *makeup*?  His skin looked smoother, and his dark circles were gone, so he looked ten years younger. He was wearing new clothes, too. A crisp collared shirt and gray pants, which I know doesn’t sound like the height of fashion or anything, but after the long reign of the puke sweater, he may as well have strolled out of a magazine cover. And he was *smiling.* A weird smile, all white and toothy. It looked painful to hold for too long. He strode to the front of the class, put his hands on his hips, and beamed: “Good morning, class!”

That was Hadley’s voice, but it was like… like somebody else was speaking through his body. Somebody who woke up with little blue birds chirping on his windowsill and mice buttoning up his shirt.

“Now that didn’t get much of a response! Where’s your enthusiasm for learning? GOOD MORNING, CLASS!”

It was quiet enough to hear the clack of Hadley’s teeth as he resumed his freaky smile.

“Today’s topic is energy, kids!” He moved to the whiteboard and wrote *ENERGY* in huge, perfectly neat letters. Even his handwriting was better than before.

“Now, last class we went over the different forms of energy. Who remembers the first law of thermodynamics?”

Lisa Greene’s voice broke the silence. “Um, the first law of thermodynamics is that energy can be neither created or destroyed,” she said quietly.

 Hadley threw his hands into the air, something that he’d only ever done before when ranting about our “bleak futures”. “Bingo, Ms. Greene! Energy can only be converted from one form to another. Now can we get a list going of some of those forms?”

Looking more confident, Lisa started to list off her on fingers. “First, there’s potential and kinetic,” she said. Hadley nodded and wrote down the two categories on the board.

“Kinetic energy—can we get some examples of kinetic energy?”

I raised my hand. “Thermal,” I said, wondering if I was having a weird dream.

Hadley nodded kindly. “Thermal! Yes, the energy of particles in motion. Keep them coming.”

“Um, mechanical,” I said. “And light, and sound, and um, sorry, I don’t remember any more.”

“That’s just fine,” Hadley said with a wave of his hand, and I actually pinched myself. He wrote down the other types on the whiteboard in his brand-new script. “Now, class, energy is a wonderful thing! Look at the lights in this room; feel the air-conditioning keeping you nice and cool. How is that we’ve harnessed the raw materials in the environment to work for our benefit? Well, we humans take the chemical energy in fossil fuels, transform it to kinetic energy as we burn it, and finally that becomes…”

Grace Hammond, who usually spent class trying to text from under her desk, raised her hand. “Electrical energy?”

“Exactly right, Ms. Hammond!”

It was easily the best class that Hadley had ever taught. I kept waiting for him to crack, for him to snap and tell us that none of us were going to graduate high school, but my waiting was in vain.

At lunch, the cafeteria went rabid with theories. Hadley had gotten a lobotomy. Hadley had won the lottery. Hadley had a secret good twin who had killed him and taken his place. Hadley had tripped and bumped his head and gone through a total personality change (Ryan Prescott said it had happened to an uncle of his and so he knew the signs).

Imaginations were running wild, but lots of the kids didn’t believe in the gossip until they saw it for themselves. Pretty soon, kids started filing past the teacher’s lounge to see for themselves. Meera Kapoor reported that apparently the other teachers looked just as astonished as the rest of us. Up until then, Hadley only ever ate his lunch alone in his classroom (the kids he had after lunch period always complained that the room smelled like weird old people food). No longer was that the case: Meera said that Hadley had been sitting at the table in the middle of the lounge, no Tupperware in sight, smiling and chatting up a storm with all the teachers. Meera said that Mrs. Caruso, had even been leaning in and tossing her hair and smiling a little *too* hard, though I’m not sure I believed that.

Round by round, everyone got a taste of new Hadley, and everyone was happy with new Hadley. He never scolded, never handed out detentions, never even asked anyone to put away their phone.

A week passed, and everyone stopped talking about it at lunch, because Chloe Thompson and Jason Wu got lice at the same time and everyone said she’d gotten it from him. But—it wasn’t normal. Nothing about new Hadley was normal. The way he talked, the way he smiled with both rows of teeth on display. The way his voice never strayed from that chipper tone. His tests were easier, and I was getting As in science for the first time, and I guess I really didn’t have anything to complain about—but *man*, it was *weird*.

It could’ve stayed at that level of uneventful weird, if not for Ryan.

It was 2:55 on a Friday when he blew The Spitball.

Of course it happened on a Friday, with everyone itching for the bell and fidgeting in their seats. Ryan, who liked to make trouble in every classroom he entered, had been chewing up bits of paper all throughout class.

Now Hadley’s back was turned while he was erasing the whiteboard, and Ryan aimed his straw at Hadley’s back.

*Phip.* The little white ball flew through the air and bounced off our teacher’s neck.

He didn’t notice.

Ryan sniggered, and his group of wannabee-Ryans elbowed each other and grinned.

He blew another spitball. Lisa stared hatefully at him.

*Phip.* The little ball hit the nape of Hadley’s neck and slid down the back of shirt. Another round of giggles from Ryan’s gang.

Our teacher turned around, smiling obliviously, and said, “Well, how about an early dismissal today, kids?”

Only, Ryan had loaded up *another spitball* and the momentum was already going, and I could see the horror spread over his face in the same beat that the spitball exited the end of the straw, and—

It hit Hadley square in the eye. Like, I think it actually bounced against his open eyeball. Hadley blinked slowly. Ryan made a sound like a frightened mouse. A round of gasps went up around the room.

Hadley struck his hands-on-hips pose and said, “Well, that’s all for today, kids!”

The bell rang, and he walked back to his desk.

I stared in disbelief. So did Ryan, and his gang, and Lisa Greene.

The stunned silence lasted only another second before Ryan made a mad grab for his backpack, leading to a shuffle of kids getting up, and we were making our way out into the hallway, then onto the buses.

“Did you see that—”

“Right in the middle of his face?”

“In his *eye!*”

“Like he didn’t even notice…”

Everyone was buzzing around Ryan, and there was a gleam in his eye that made me nervous. “I wasn’t even nervous,” I heard him boasting. “I knew he wasn’t gonna do nothing.”

“That was *so* disrespectful,” Lisa hissed, penetrating into the crowd of newly minted Ryan fans.

He crossed his arms and looked like he was considering sticking out his tongue at her before deciding he was too mature for that. “Was not. Hadley’s a crap teacher anyway.”

“He is *not*.”

“Okay, well, he *used* to be. Now he’s like… high or something all the time,” Ryan said to a round of chortles.

Grace Hammond piped up. “Ryan, did you really mean to hit him or was it an accident?”

“I meant to,” he said casually.

“No way,” Grace scoffed. “If that’s true, then do it again on Monday.”

A round of *oohs* went up. Ryan turned a little pink, then composed himself and shrugged. “Yeah, sure thing. I don’t care.”

Monday rolled around and the class was brimming with anticipation. Nobody was absorbing a word of Hadley’s lecture on the phases of matter (even though it was pretty interesting stuff, honestly, and I wanted to hear more about whatever plasma was). Ryan was sweating bullets next to me, twiddling a straw between his fingers. Two rows ahead of us, Grace kept turning around with a toss of her shiny hair and looking expectantly at Ryan. There were only ten minutes left in class. I saw him take a deep breath and bring the straw to his lips.

“So, heat is the same thing as kinetic energy…”

*Plip!* Nobody could miss the spitball bounce between his eyes.

“…and that is why boiling water causes it to change into the vapor phase. Isn’t that just incredible?”

There had been absolutely no realization in his eyes. None.

One of the rowdier guys in class, Jason Wu, balled up a piece of paper and threw it at Hadley’s back. It hit him and landed on the ground.

No response. Jason couldn’t muffle his giggle. Grace was grinning behind her hands, her eyes wide and gleaming.

The weeks rolled by, and we grew bolder. Hadley would get in maybe ten minutes of actual teaching before the class descended into chatter and horseplay. The annoying thing is that Hadley had finally gotten the hang of teaching in a way that didn’t make me want to flee the country. It was by-the-book, pretty robotic, actually, but that was heaven compared to the lectures he’d been giving before. It was too bad I could hardly absorb the lessons over my rowdy classmates.

About a month into Hadley’s transformation, the class had lost all residual fear of him, like domesticated animals forgetting to be scared around their natural predators. One Monday, Grace took out her phone and started casually scrolling it next to the science workbook we were supposed to be filling out. Hadley furrowed his brow. “No phones during class, Grace,” he said lamely. Everyone froze. Old Hadley would’ve gotten out the bear-safe food locker and made Grace do a walk of shame up to the desk.

New Hadley turned around and finished drawing the structure of sodium chloride with perfect, straight black lines.

Grace exchanged glances and giggles with her best friend, Mona, and kept on scrolling. Ten minutes later, Hadley turned around and squinted in her direction, said “no phones during class,” and continued to talk about ionic bonds.

On Tuesday, we were learning about the differences between plant and animal cells by looking at onion slices under a microscope. I remember the day well because Grace Hammond was my lab partner and it felt like I was half outside my body, watching as I made a big dumb fool of myself. Half of the kids weren’t doing their experiments at all. Ryan was flicking onion bits at his buddies, and they’d made a game of trying to catch it in their mouths. Hadley was walking placidly around the classroom, stopping every now and then to check on a microscope and nod or make a minor adjustment. Even though he creeped me out a little, I *liked* new Hadley—he was helpful. I didn’t get why everyone made such a joke of pushing him around.

As he was walking down the last row, I saw Jason elbow Ryan and snigger something into his ear. I was looking down the barrel of my microscope—was that anaphase?—when I heard a loud thud. I looked up.

Hadley was lying face-first on the floor. Ryan, Jason, and their friends were standing around him with bug eyes and suppressed laughter. Ryan hadn’t even bothered to move his foot from where it was planted in the middle of the row.

Lisa was turning red as she took in the scene. I was on her side, but when I opened my mouth to say something to Ryan, my voice shrank and died in my throat. “You are *bullying* him,” she hissed, and I saw that she was trying not to cry.

“Oh no! Are you okay, *Mister Hadley?*” Ryan said with mock concern. Lots of nervous giggles were going up around the room.

We all watched as Hadley got up from the floor. He did it so smooth and steady you’d never have guessed he’d just been tripped by surprise, pushing himself up on his hands first and then rising to his feet. He brushed off his pants. I could have sworn his forehead looked dented. “Well, excuse me, class,” he said stiffly. “I must have lost my balance.”

And with that, he returned to his desk and spent the rest of the class grading papers. Ryan hi-fived his friends in plain view of everyone.

I went home from school that day feeling shaken. Ryan had always been a jerk, but for the first time, I felt a real stir of hatred for him. My mom noticed that I was upset, but I brushed it off—no matter what happened, I wasn’t going to be the kid who called in the parents to shut things down. On the bright side, she decided to take me out for ice cream, our family’s failsafe method for cheering someone up.

I was walking out of the Baskin Robbins with a loaded rocky-road cone when I saw him. Mr. Hadley. He had just come out of the hardware store carrying two heavy-looking bags, and he was making a beeline for his car. I stopped in my tracks and stared. Was *this* what he did after school? I’d seen in him the wild while out with my family a few times when he was still a miserable old crank, but this was the first time since the personality replacement. He looked… different. How had he been hiding that beer belly in class? And where was the perfect posture? Not only that, but his whole face looked grumpier, his eyes sharper, more *alive*, and I wondered if he taped his face skin back during the school hours or something. Adults did some pretty crazy things when they hit their midlife crises, didn’t they? As ridiculous as that seemed, I couldn’t think of any other explanation for the difference.

The next week, the bright, smiley Hadley was back in class, but the kids were different. It wasn’t just Ryan anymore. Everyone had been emboldened by last week’s incident. Kids talked right over him, and his meek reprimands had zero effect. It got worse every day, and I was at a loss for why Hadley was allowing it to happen. On Tuesday, he got tripped *again*, this time by scrawny Stewart Fogel, who until then I’d always thought was as incapable of misbehaving as Lisa. He got up without a word. On Wednesday, Jason Wu came in early to put a thumbtack on his chair, and the whole class watched with baited breath as he sat down on it and… nothing. He didn’t even exhale. We all saw the thumbtack poking out of his pants when he turned around, too. That started the rumor that Hadley wore ten layers of underwear. On Thursday, Grace brought a roll of toilet paper from the girl’s bathroom and wrapped it around his leg while Mona distracted him with questions about the homework. He walked around the rest of the class with the paper trailing behind him, refusing to acknowledge it.

The next week, it was clear that Hadley was off his game. There was one class period where Lisa raised her hand three times before he noticed her. At one point he stood in front of the whiteboard with an uncapped marker for what felt like five minutes before shaking his head and sitting back down, the board blank as snow. I felt bad. If he really had bumped his head and lost his ability to stand up to his students, how far were we going to push it?

On Thursday, we got to class and there was no Hadley present. No substitute, either.

“It’s been fifteen minutes, that means we can leave,” Jason Wu chirped up after three minutes had elapsed.

“No, it doesn’t,” Lisa said.

“Lisa’s going to tell the principal,” moaned Mona.

Grace chimed in.  “Lisa, you’re not gonna do that, are you? You’re not gonna ruin it for everyone?”

“No, I guess I’m not,” Lisa said, thin-lipped.

I guess none of the other teachers bothered to look into the room as they walked by, because we passed the period drawing on the whiteboards and dicking around.

The next day, we arrived again to an empty classroom. It was a Friday, and there was an energy of mischief crackling in the air. It was in the way Ryan and his wannabees strutted into the room, shoving each other around as they filed in, and how Grace’s clique giggled and whispered to each other in the circle of chairs they’d arranged at the back of class. Lisa was sitting stiffly at her desk, trying not to make eye contact with anyone.

“Bet he died and the school just hasn’t noticed yet,” Ryan said. “You know what that means, right, guys?”

“It means we can do whatever we want,” Jason said, jumping up on a table.

“You guys,” Lisa said in a small voice. “We should just wait a few minutes.”

“Or we get to have fun,” Ryan said, rolling his eyes. “Turn down the lights!” One of the guys ran to the light switches and dimmed them so the familiar room fell into shadows. It looked bigger when it was dark. A few yelps went up from the crowd before dissolving into giggles and shouts. People got out of their desks and went to go chat with their friends. Furniture was shuffled and rearranged.

Somebody started playing music—loud, thumping music that spiked my nerves like someone drumming on my spine.

There was a new sound, too, one of jangling glass. I looked up. Jason had somehow found the key to the equipment cabinets and was rifling through the glass beakers and tubes. In the dark, I couldn’t see if he did it on purpose or not, but we all heard the crash of a rack of test tubes splintering on the ground.

Somebody screeched in the dark. Jason laughed, and it was like a contagion: everyone else laughed too. I even found myself laughing.

“Guys, *stop* it, or I’m going to call a teacher,” Lisa said, louder this time.

*Thwock*. Something bounced off of Lisa’s forehead and thumped onto the ground. She looked down. So did everyone else. A pink eraser.

This time, the laughter ripped shamelessly through the room, drowning out any protestations. I felt myself laughing too. It was so loud that nobody noticed the door clicking open. Nobody noticed the adult marching his way to the front of the room. Nobody noticed until—

“*WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?”*

Was this really the same calm, smiling Hadley from only three days ago? He was standing purple-faced with his eyes bulging, his head poking out of that putrid green sweater like a turtle sticking out of its shell. His bellow *should* have been terrifying. A month and a half ago, that would’ve had everyone freezing on the spot and awaiting their doom.

Now, it only made everyone laugh harder. It was just *Hadley.* Not like he was going to do anything.

“Hey guys, let’s give him a big welcome!” Ryan shouted.

I don’t know who threw the first projectile. Maybe Jason, maybe one of the nerdy kids. It could’ve been anyone. *Whack!* The pencil struck Hadley in the forehead, point first, leaving a dot of graphite above his eyebrows. For a moment, he stood stock-still, his eyes bulging out of his head.

A fresh wave of shouts and chortles. I couldn’t help it—I felt it bubbling out of my mouth again. The image of Hadley standing there with the pencil mark on his face, his mouth hanging open—it was *funny*. He was shouting something now, but nobody could hear it above our laughter. More kids were climbing up on the tables. I saw a girl rifling through her backpack, her face obscured by the dark. In fact, it was hard to see who anyone was other than Hadley.

A small object whizzed through the air and smacked Hadley on the side of the head. Maybe another pencil. If you thought he couldn’t get any angrier, *boy*. Then another, and another, and other. It was hard to tell what was being thrown: Erasers? Balled-up paper? Packs of gum? Anything we had at hand was getting chucked. I saw Lisa trying to get to the door, but everyone was jostling her, making it hard for her move more than a few feet.

I was getting left out; I needed to act before I got hit, too. My arm reached for a pencil sharpener and pitched it across the room. I don’t know if it hit him. I couldn’t see much of what was happening anymore; I was one of the few kids who wasn’t standing on the tables.

Still, I was part of the festivities. It was *fun.*

The projectiles were getting bigger. Notebooks. Pencil cases. Shoes.

You could barely hear the shouts of indignation through the laughter. You could barely hear them turn to shouts of pain.

Then, the sound of shattered glass; a pretty, twinkling sound.

Somebody perched on a chair was handing beakers and test tubes to the waiting hands below. Somebody handing out scissors.

*Crash! Crash! Crash!* Explosions of glass, everywhere.

Screams not like a grown man would make, but high-pitched, cartoonish. Funny screams. Fake screams.

Laughter.

A textbook arcing through the air, coming down with the kind of thud you hear in cartoons.

More laughter, mad laughter.

Someone jumped down from a table. Impossible to tell who, in the dark. I saw their knees bend like they were Mario prepared to stomp on a Goomba.

A funny sound, cracking and wet at the same time. Imagine encrusting a water balloon in concrete, then popping the whole thing. Krak-sploosh!

Laughter like hyenas. More dancing bodies jumping down from the tables. Hands sweeping across shelves, seeking any straggling glass or metal. Music pounding, turning the classroom into a disco, the glass crunching in tune with the beat.

We couldn’t see a thing. That’s what they said after. That’s how they said it got out of control.

There’s a piece of that day that’s just fallen out of my head. Between the height of the laughter and the glass and the screams and the silence after, silence that seems sudden in my recollection, but I know that wasn’t the case. I know it must’ve died down bit by bit. But in my head it’s like a time skip. Like waking up from a dream.

Like all of us waking up at once.

The lights came on. Lisa Greene was standing at the doorway, her face covered in scratches. Mrs. Caruso, was standing behind her. The class looked like a hurricane had ran through it.

And at the eye of the storm?

Everyone stared wordlessly at the center of the room, seeing the red mess.

---------------------------------------------------------

In today’s fast-paced world, finding effective ways to relax and reduce stress is more important than ever. One unique option gaining attention is mushroom-infused drinks. Often overlooked in modern wellness circles, these beverages can provide a soothing way to unwind. But what exactly makes them a game changer for stress relief?

Firstly, let’s explore the types of mushrooms commonly used in these drinks. Adaptogenic mushrooms like Reishi, Lion’s Mane, and Chaga are popular choices. They are known for their potential health benefits, which include enhancing immune function and boosting mental clarity. Most importantly, they can help the body manage stress better.

Reishi mushrooms, often called “the mushroom of immortality,” are praised for their calming effects. Drinking Reishi-infused tea or other beverages can help reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality. This is particularly beneficial if you often find it hard to switch off after a long day.

Lion’s Mane is another fantastic addition to the stress-relief toolkit. This mushroom may support cognitive function and enhance mood. When combined in a delicious drink, Lion’s Mane can provide a sense of mental clarity, helping you tackle daily challenges with a calmer mindset.

Chaga mushrooms are packed with antioxidants, which can reduce inflammation in the body. When you consume Chaga-infused drinks, you not only enjoy a rich flavor but also help your body combat stressors. By reducing physical stress in the body, you create an environment conducive to mental relaxation.

Now that we understand the types of mushrooms to look for, let’s talk about how these beverages work to relieve stress. Here are a few key points:

- **Adaptogen Benefits:** Adaptogens help your body adapt to stress by regulating cortisol levels. This can lead to a more balanced emotional state.
- **Mindfulness Ritual:** Preparing and enjoying a mushroom drink can be a calming ritual. The act of slowing down can itself be a stress reliever.
- **Nutrient-Rich:** Mushroom-infused beverages are often full of vitamins and minerals. This nutrient boost can enhance your overall mood and well-being.

One of the best things about mushroom-infused drinks is their versatility. You can find these beverages in various forms, including teas, coffee alternatives, and smoothies. This variety means you can easily incorporate them into your daily routine. Whether you prefer a warm tea in the morning or a chilling smoothie in the afternoon, there’s a mushroom drink for you.

Moreover, these drinks can easily be customized. Add them to your favorite ingredients such as honey, almond milk, or even spices like cinnamon. This not only enhances the flavor but can also maximize the health benefits each ingredient offers. As you sip on your delightful concoction, you may start to feel more at ease, helping you counteract those stressful moments throughout the day.

Another noteworthy benefit of mushroom-infused drinks is their sustainability. Mushrooms can be cultivated in a way that is less taxing on the environment than many traditional crops. By choosing these drinks, you not only invest in your health but also support eco-friendly practices. Many brands are now focusing on sustainable sourcing, ensuring that your drink is as good for the planet as it is for your body.

Many people report feeling relaxed and stress-free after incorporating these drinks into their diets.

Different types of mushrooms offer unique health benefits, making them popular choices for those seeking stress relief and overall wellness. Let’s explore some of the most common mushrooms used in these drinks and what sets them apart.

1jyclmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1jyclmc/the_substitute/,The Substitute,"Mr. Hadley wasn’t anyone’s favorite teacher.

He was mean as a snake. A harsh grader. He’d go off on tangents about topics that were *way* too hard for a sixth-grade class to understand, pause, glare at us like we were stinking up the room, and say, “well, those of you who’ll make it to college *might* learn more about that someday.” He smelled musty, like burnt coffee and old food, and he was more often than not wearing a putrid wool sweater that made me itch just looking at it. He was one of the older teachers at Moreland Middle School—at least he *looked* older, with dorky round glasses and six whole strands of hair—and seemed to deeply resent teaching a class of 12-year-olds with 12-year-old brains.

I was sitting next to Lisa Greene when the test thudded onto my desk. *C-.* I sighed in relief. Lisa glanced over, holding her chin high as she awaited her own test. I tried not to feel inferior as I flipped through the pages, cringing at all the questions that had been marked up in red ink.

Look, it’s not like I was a slacker. Mr. Hadley’s tests were *ridiculous*. He’d had to change them after a few parents complained about the “non-standard content”, and after that he *did* start to follow the standard curriculum, at least, but he still worded things like a sphinx, like he was hoping we’d pick the wrong letter and fall down some secret trapdoor. We’d all heard him grumbling about how “the world wasn’t built for geniuses” and he'd be damned if he was going to “help mediocrity prosper” like the rest of the teachers at Moreland.

The other teachers didn’t like him very much. Shocker, I know. Not even Mrs. Caruso, the English teacher, got along with him, and she didn’t have a mean bone in her body.

I wondered if Hadley had always hated the job so much. I couldn’t imagine a past version of him who didn’t enjoy tormenting children. As much as he already sucked, I swear that he was getting *worse.* Over the last few weeks, he’d been coming into class crankier than ever, and looking exhausted, too. He’d stopped bothering with combing back the six strands haloing his mirrorball head, and he actually wore the puke sweater for 11 days straight (I knew because I kept tallies in my science notebook).

He even yelled at Lisa when she asked a question about mitosis. A stunned silence fell over the class. For a moment, Hadley looked guilty, then his mouth twisted like he tasted something sour and he turned away from the crestfallen girl.

I don’t remember what I was doing on that Thursday evening. Playing video games, then homework, probably. It was probably an ordinary night for everyone except for Hadley. I still wonder what happened that night after he got into his car and drove home.

On Friday morning, he came in a changed man.

A changed man, *with* *candy*. The good stuff, too. Full-size chocolate bars. Instead of pulling up his usual lecture, he turned to us and said, “Good day to you all, my lovely students! Today’s no ordinary day, so why would we have an ordinary class? We’re going to watch a movie!”

I didn’t need to look around the class to sense the astonishment. Was this some kind of cruel trick?

You could hear a pin drop as he put on Osmosis Jones and handed out candy bars from a giant bag, humming cheerily all the time. I broke mine in half before eating to make sure there wasn’t anything nasty in there—nope. Just caramel and nougat.

I kept looking over at Hadley every few minutes from my safe position in the back right corner of the room. He was smiling gleefully behind his desk, his face lit up with an energy that had formerly only been applied to torturing his students. Every so often he’d lean over and scribble something down inside a beaten-up notebook.

That was Friday. The weekend passed with no science homework, for once. Then came Monday.

I was in my usual seat at the back corner of the room when Mr. Hadley walked in, but even from that distance I could tell something was very wrong.

He was taller. More upright, at least, like we were seeing him stand up straight for the first time ever. And had he put on *makeup*?  His skin looked smoother, and his dark circles were gone, so he looked ten years younger. He was wearing new clothes, too. A crisp collared shirt and gray pants, which I know doesn’t sound like the height of fashion or anything, but after the long reign of the puke sweater, he may as well have strolled out of a magazine cover. And he was *smiling.* A weird smile, all white and toothy. It looked painful to hold for too long. He strode to the front of the class, put his hands on his hips, and beamed: “Good morning, class!”

That was Hadley’s voice, but it was like… like somebody else was speaking through his body. Somebody who woke up with little blue birds chirping on his windowsill and mice buttoning up his shirt.

“Now that didn’t get much of a response! Where’s your enthusiasm for learning? GOOD MORNING, CLASS!”

It was quiet enough to hear the clack of Hadley’s teeth as he resumed his freaky smile.

“Today’s topic is energy, kids!” He moved to the whiteboard and wrote *ENERGY* in huge, perfectly neat letters. Even his handwriting was better than before.

“Now, last class we went over the different forms of energy. Who remembers the first law of thermodynamics?”

Lisa Greene’s voice broke the silence. “Um, the first law of thermodynamics is that energy can be neither created or destroyed,” she said quietly.

 Hadley threw his hands into the air, something that he’d only ever done before when ranting about our “bleak futures”. “Bingo, Ms. Greene! Energy can only be converted from one form to another. Now can we get a list going of some of those forms?”

Looking more confident, Lisa started to list off her on fingers. “First, there’s potential and kinetic,” she said. Hadley nodded and wrote down the two categories on the board.

“Kinetic energy—can we get some examples of kinetic energy?”

I raised my hand. “Thermal,” I said, wondering if I was having a weird dream.

Hadley nodded kindly. “Thermal! Yes, the energy of particles in motion. Keep them coming.”

“Um, mechanical,” I said. “And light, and sound, and um, sorry, I don’t remember any more.”

“That’s just fine,” Hadley said with a wave of his hand, and I actually pinched myself. He wrote down the other types on the whiteboard in his brand-new script. “Now, class, energy is a wonderful thing! Look at the lights in this room; feel the air-conditioning keeping you nice and cool. How is that we’ve harnessed the raw materials in the environment to work for our benefit? Well, we humans take the chemical energy in fossil fuels, transform it to kinetic energy as we burn it, and finally that becomes…”

Grace Hammond, who usually spent class trying to text from under her desk, raised her hand. “Electrical energy?”

“Exactly right, Ms. Hammond!”

It was easily the best class that Hadley had ever taught. I kept waiting for him to crack, for him to snap and tell us that none of us were going to graduate high school, but my waiting was in vain.

At lunch, the cafeteria went rabid with theories. Hadley had gotten a lobotomy. Hadley had won the lottery. Hadley had a secret good twin who had killed him and taken his place. Hadley had tripped and bumped his head and gone through a total personality change (Ryan Prescott said it had happened to an uncle of his and so he knew the signs).

Imaginations were running wild, but lots of the kids didn’t believe in the gossip until they saw it for themselves. Pretty soon, kids started filing past the teacher’s lounge to see for themselves. Meera Kapoor reported that apparently the other teachers looked just as astonished as the rest of us. Up until then, Hadley only ever ate his lunch alone in his classroom (the kids he had after lunch period always complained that the room smelled like weird old people food). No longer was that the case: Meera said that Hadley had been sitting at the table in the middle of the lounge, no Tupperware in sight, smiling and chatting up a storm with all the teachers. Meera said that Mrs. Caruso, had even been leaning in and tossing her hair and smiling a little *too* hard, though I’m not sure I believed that.

Round by round, everyone got a taste of new Hadley, and everyone was happy with new Hadley. He never scolded, never handed out detentions, never even asked anyone to put away their phone.

A week passed, and everyone stopped talking about it at lunch, because Chloe Thompson and Jason Wu got lice at the same time and everyone said she’d gotten it from him. But—it wasn’t normal. Nothing about new Hadley was normal. The way he talked, the way he smiled with both rows of teeth on display. The way his voice never strayed from that chipper tone. His tests were easier, and I was getting As in science for the first time, and I guess I really didn’t have anything to complain about—but *man*, it was *weird*.

It could’ve stayed at that level of uneventful weird, if not for Ryan.

It was 2:55 on a Friday when he blew The Spitball.

Of course it happened on a Friday, with everyone itching for the bell and fidgeting in their seats. Ryan, who liked to make trouble in every classroom he entered, had been chewing up bits of paper all throughout class.

Now Hadley’s back was turned while he was erasing the whiteboard, and Ryan aimed his straw at Hadley’s back.

*Phip.* The little white ball flew through the air and bounced off our teacher’s neck.

He didn’t notice.

Ryan sniggered, and his group of wannabee-Ryans elbowed each other and grinned.

He blew another spitball. Lisa stared hatefully at him.

*Phip.* The little ball hit the nape of Hadley’s neck and slid down the back of shirt. Another round of giggles from Ryan’s gang.

Our teacher turned around, smiling obliviously, and said, “Well, how about an early dismissal today, kids?”

Only, Ryan had loaded up *another spitball* and the momentum was already going, and I could see the horror spread over his face in the same beat that the spitball exited the end of the straw, and—

It hit Hadley square in the eye. Like, I think it actually bounced against his open eyeball. Hadley blinked slowly. Ryan made a sound like a frightened mouse. A round of gasps went up around the room.

Hadley struck his hands-on-hips pose and said, “Well, that’s all for today, kids!”

The bell rang, and he walked back to his desk.

I stared in disbelief. So did Ryan, and his gang, and Lisa Greene.

The stunned silence lasted only another second before Ryan made a mad grab for his backpack, leading to a shuffle of kids getting up, and we were making our way out into the hallway, then onto the buses.

“Did you see that—”

“Right in the middle of his face?”

“In his *eye!*”

“Like he didn’t even notice…”

Everyone was buzzing around Ryan, and there was a gleam in his eye that made me nervous. “I wasn’t even nervous,” I heard him boasting. “I knew he wasn’t gonna do nothing.”

“That was *so* disrespectful,” Lisa hissed, penetrating into the crowd of newly minted Ryan fans.

He crossed his arms and looked like he was considering sticking out his tongue at her before deciding he was too mature for that. “Was not. Hadley’s a crap teacher anyway.”

“He is *not*.”

“Okay, well, he *used* to be. Now he’s like… high or something all the time,” Ryan said to a round of chortles.

Grace Hammond piped up. “Ryan, did you really mean to hit him or was it an accident?”

“I meant to,” he said casually.

“No way,” Grace scoffed. “If that’s true, then do it again on Monday.”

A round of *oohs* went up. Ryan turned a little pink, then composed himself and shrugged. “Yeah, sure thing. I don’t care.”

Monday rolled around and the class was brimming with anticipation. Nobody was absorbing a word of Hadley’s lecture on the phases of matter (even though it was pretty interesting stuff, honestly, and I wanted to hear more about whatever plasma was). Ryan was sweating bullets next to me, twiddling a straw between his fingers. Two rows ahead of us, Grace kept turning around with a toss of her shiny hair and looking expectantly at Ryan. There were only ten minutes left in class. I saw him take a deep breath and bring the straw to his lips.

“So, heat is the same thing as kinetic energy…”

*Plip!* Nobody could miss the spitball bounce between his eyes.

“…and that is why boiling water causes it to change into the vapor phase. Isn’t that just incredible?”

There had been absolutely no realization in his eyes. None.

One of the rowdier guys in class, Jason Wu, balled up a piece of paper and threw it at Hadley’s back. It hit him and landed on the ground.

No response. Jason couldn’t muffle his giggle. Grace was grinning behind her hands, her eyes wide and gleaming.

The weeks rolled by, and we grew bolder. Hadley would get in maybe ten minutes of actual teaching before the class descended into chatter and horseplay. The annoying thing is that Hadley had finally gotten the hang of teaching in a way that didn’t make me want to flee the country. It was by-the-book, pretty robotic, actually, but that was heaven compared to the lectures he’d been giving before. It was too bad I could hardly absorb the lessons over my rowdy classmates.

About a month into Hadley’s transformation, the class had lost all residual fear of him, like domesticated animals forgetting to be scared around their natural predators. One Monday, Grace took out her phone and started casually scrolling it next to the science workbook we were supposed to be filling out. Hadley furrowed his brow. “No phones during class, Grace,” he said lamely. Everyone froze. Old Hadley would’ve gotten out the bear-safe food locker and made Grace do a walk of shame up to the desk.

New Hadley turned around and finished drawing the structure of sodium chloride with perfect, straight black lines.

Grace exchanged glances and giggles with her best friend, Mona, and kept on scrolling. Ten minutes later, Hadley turned around and squinted in her direction, said “no phones during class,” and continued to talk about ionic bonds.

On Tuesday, we were learning about the differences between plant and animal cells by looking at onion slices under a microscope. I remember the day well because Grace Hammond was my lab partner and it felt like I was half outside my body, watching as I made a big dumb fool of myself. Half of the kids weren’t doing their experiments at all. Ryan was flicking onion bits at his buddies, and they’d made a game of trying to catch it in their mouths. Hadley was walking placidly around the classroom, stopping every now and then to check on a microscope and nod or make a minor adjustment. Even though he creeped me out a little, I *liked* new Hadley—he was helpful. I didn’t get why everyone made such a joke of pushing him around.

As he was walking down the last row, I saw Jason elbow Ryan and snigger something into his ear. I was looking down the barrel of my microscope—was that anaphase?—when I heard a loud thud. I looked up.

Hadley was lying face-first on the floor. Ryan, Jason, and their friends were standing around him with bug eyes and suppressed laughter. Ryan hadn’t even bothered to move his foot from where it was planted in the middle of the row.

Lisa was turning red as she took in the scene. I was on her side, but when I opened my mouth to say something to Ryan, my voice shrank and died in my throat. “You are *bullying* him,” she hissed, and I saw that she was trying not to cry.

“Oh no! Are you okay, *Mister Hadley?*” Ryan said with mock concern. Lots of nervous giggles were going up around the room.

We all watched as Hadley got up from the floor. He did it so smooth and steady you’d never have guessed he’d just been tripped by surprise, pushing himself up on his hands first and then rising to his feet. He brushed off his pants. I could have sworn his forehead looked dented. “Well, excuse me, class,” he said stiffly. “I must have lost my balance.”

And with that, he returned to his desk and spent the rest of the class grading papers. Ryan hi-fived his friends in plain view of everyone.

I went home from school that day feeling shaken. Ryan had always been a jerk, but for the first time, I felt a real stir of hatred for him. My mom noticed that I was upset, but I brushed it off—no matter what happened, I wasn’t going to be the kid who called in the parents to shut things down. On the bright side, she decided to take me out for ice cream, our family’s failsafe method for cheering someone up.

I was walking out of the Baskin Robbins with a loaded rocky-road cone when I saw him. Mr. Hadley. He had just come out of the hardware store carrying two heavy-looking bags, and he was making a beeline for his car. I stopped in my tracks and stared. Was *this* what he did after school? I’d seen in him the wild while out with my family a few times when he was still a miserable old crank, but this was the first time since the personality replacement. He looked… different. How had he been hiding that beer belly in class? And where was the perfect posture? Not only that, but his whole face looked grumpier, his eyes sharper, more *alive*, and I wondered if he taped his face skin back during the school hours or something. Adults did some pretty crazy things when they hit their midlife crises, didn’t they? As ridiculous as that seemed, I couldn’t think of any other explanation for the difference.

The next week, the bright, smiley Hadley was back in class, but the kids were different. It wasn’t just Ryan anymore. Everyone had been emboldened by last week’s incident. Kids talked right over him, and his meek reprimands had zero effect. It got worse every day, and I was at a loss for why Hadley was allowing it to happen. On Tuesday, he got tripped *again*, this time by scrawny Stewart Fogel, who until then I’d always thought was as incapable of misbehaving as Lisa. He got up without a word. On Wednesday, Jason Wu came in early to put a thumbtack on his chair, and the whole class watched with baited breath as he sat down on it and… nothing. He didn’t even exhale. We all saw the thumbtack poking out of his pants when he turned around, too. That started the rumor that Hadley wore ten layers of underwear. On Thursday, Grace brought a roll of toilet paper from the girl’s bathroom and wrapped it around his leg while Mona distracted him with questions about the homework. He walked around the rest of the class with the paper trailing behind him, refusing to acknowledge it.

The next week, it was clear that Hadley was off his game. There was one class period where Lisa raised her hand three times before he noticed her. At one point he stood in front of the whiteboard with an uncapped marker for what felt like five minutes before shaking his head and sitting back down, the board blank as snow. I felt bad. If he really had bumped his head and lost his ability to stand up to his students, how far were we going to push it?

On Thursday, we got to class and there was no Hadley present. No substitute, either.

“It’s been fifteen minutes, that means we can leave,” Jason Wu chirped up after three minutes had elapsed.

“No, it doesn’t,” Lisa said.

“Lisa’s going to tell the principal,” moaned Mona.

Grace chimed in.  “Lisa, you’re not gonna do that, are you? You’re not gonna ruin it for everyone?”

“No, I guess I’m not,” Lisa said, thin-lipped.

I guess none of the other teachers bothered to look into the room as they walked by, because we passed the period drawing on the whiteboards and dicking around.

The next day, we arrived again to an empty classroom. It was a Friday, and there was an energy of mischief crackling in the air. It was in the way Ryan and his wannabees strutted into the room, shoving each other around as they filed in, and how Grace’s clique giggled and whispered to each other in the circle of chairs they’d arranged at the back of class. Lisa was sitting stiffly at her desk, trying not to make eye contact with anyone.

“Bet he died and the school just hasn’t noticed yet,” Ryan said. “You know what that means, right, guys?”

“It means we can do whatever we want,” Jason said, jumping up on a table.

“You guys,” Lisa said in a small voice. “We should just wait a few minutes.”

“Or we get to have fun,” Ryan said, rolling his eyes. “Turn down the lights!” One of the guys ran to the light switches and dimmed them so the familiar room fell into shadows. It looked bigger when it was dark. A few yelps went up from the crowd before dissolving into giggles and shouts. People got out of their desks and went to go chat with their friends. Furniture was shuffled and rearranged.

Somebody started playing music—loud, thumping music that spiked my nerves like someone drumming on my spine.

There was a new sound, too, one of jangling glass. I looked up. Jason had somehow found the key to the equipment cabinets and was rifling through the glass beakers and tubes. In the dark, I couldn’t see if he did it on purpose or not, but we all heard the crash of a rack of test tubes splintering on the ground.

Somebody screeched in the dark. Jason laughed, and it was like a contagion: everyone else laughed too. I even found myself laughing.

“Guys, *stop* it, or I’m going to call a teacher,” Lisa said, louder this time.

*Thwock*. Something bounced off of Lisa’s forehead and thumped onto the ground. She looked down. So did everyone else. A pink eraser.

This time, the laughter ripped shamelessly through the room, drowning out any protestations. I felt myself laughing too. It was so loud that nobody noticed the door clicking open. Nobody noticed the adult marching his way to the front of the room. Nobody noticed until—

“*WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?”*

Was this really the same calm, smiling Hadley from only three days ago? He was standing purple-faced with his eyes bulging, his head poking out of that putrid green sweater like a turtle sticking out of its shell. His bellow *should* have been terrifying. A month and a half ago, that would’ve had everyone freezing on the spot and awaiting their doom.

Now, it only made everyone laugh harder. It was just *Hadley.* Not like he was going to do anything.

“Hey guys, let’s give him a big welcome!” Ryan shouted.

I don’t know who threw the first projectile. Maybe Jason, maybe one of the nerdy kids. It could’ve been anyone. *Whack!* The pencil struck Hadley in the forehead, point first, leaving a dot of graphite above his eyebrows. For a moment, he stood stock-still, his eyes bulging out of his head.

A fresh wave of shouts and chortles. I couldn’t help it—I felt it bubbling out of my mouth again. The image of Hadley standing there with the pencil mark on his face, his mouth hanging open—it was *funny*. He was shouting something now, but nobody could hear it above our laughter. More kids were climbing up on the tables. I saw a girl rifling through her backpack, her face obscured by the dark. In fact, it was hard to see who anyone was other than Hadley.

A small object whizzed through the air and smacked Hadley on the side of the head. Maybe another pencil. If you thought he couldn’t get any angrier, *boy*. Then another, and another, and other. It was hard to tell what was being thrown: Erasers? Balled-up paper? Packs of gum? Anything we had at hand was getting chucked. I saw Lisa trying to get to the door, but everyone was jostling her, making it hard for her move more than a few feet.

I was getting left out; I needed to act before I got hit, too. My arm reached for a pencil sharpener and pitched it across the room. I don’t know if it hit him. I couldn’t see much of what was happening anymore; I was one of the few kids who wasn’t standing on the tables.

Still, I was part of the festivities. It was *fun.*

The projectiles were getting bigger. Notebooks. Pencil cases. Shoes.

You could barely hear the shouts of indignation through the laughter. You could barely hear them turn to shouts of pain.

Then, the sound of shattered glass; a pretty, twinkling sound.

Somebody perched on a chair was handing beakers and test tubes to the waiting hands below. Somebody handing out scissors.

*Crash! Crash! Crash!* Explosions of glass, everywhere.

Screams not like a grown man would make, but high-pitched, cartoonish. Funny screams. Fake screams.

Laughter.

A textbook arcing through the air, coming down with the kind of thud you hear in cartoons.

More laughter, mad laughter.

Someone jumped down from a table. Impossible to tell who, in the dark. I saw their knees bend like they were Mario prepared to stomp on a Goomba.

A funny sound, cracking and wet at the same time. Imagine encrusting a water balloon in concrete, then popping the whole thing. Krak-sploosh!

Laughter like hyenas. More dancing bodies jumping down from the tables. Hands sweeping across shelves, seeking any straggling glass or metal. Music pounding, turning the classroom into a disco, the glass crunching in tune with the beat.

We couldn’t see a thing. That’s what they said after. That’s how they said it got out of control.

There’s a piece of that day that’s just fallen out of my head. Between the height of the laughter and the glass and the screams and the silence after, silence that seems sudden in my recollection, but I know that wasn’t the case. I know it must’ve died down bit by bit. But in my head it’s like a time skip. Like waking up from a dream.

Like all of us waking up at once.

The lights came on. Lisa Greene was standing at the doorway, her face covered in scratches. Mrs. Caruso, was standing behind her. The class looked like a hurricane had ran through it.

And at the eye of the storm?

Everyone stared wordlessly at the center of the room, seeing the red mess.

Poor Mrs. Caruso began to scream.",1,1744564263.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False
1jycl5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1jycl5h/14_years_and_still_minimum_wage/,14 Years and still minimum wage?,"Throwaway because I don’t know if anyone I work with is on here. I’ll try to keep it short. Firstly I’m in the UK so all salaries mentioned are in £ 

I’ve worked with a family member in this business on and off since I was 14, I was still in school doing small bits for them. 

After school I got a full time job with them. Started off on a wage of around 20k which was decent for 18 (2010), I was good at my job, it was fun and interesting, however, there were no pay rises to be had and I was constantly sent on coffee runs or to get lunch for everyone by the boss. After some time the company was bought out by a bigger one and I, along with a few others, was made redundant. 

Fast forward to being 30, I’d had another few jobs at minimum wage and my family member had set up a new company, which I asked about. They told me they’d hire me part time only, but over time I decided to go full time with them as they offered and I do love the line of work, and in the ridiculous hopes that maybe this could be my way up, I thought times had changed and with a new company and different responsibilities in a new role as a social media marketing manager (I’m a video editor proficient in after effects, photoshop, premiere and most of creative cloud) the other boss (family friend) wanted to pay me 23k for this role. 

I refused and told them if they wanted me to manage everything, create content to deadlines, post daily, run ads and have other responsibilities that I would want a proper wage to do so. I asked my other boss (family friend) for 30k, he said it was too steep as they were a new company starting out. 

We agreed on 25k to start with my other boss (family friend) who had promised me that in a year or 2 I would be on 35k with new hires, be managing a small team and be able to assign work to them to help with deadlines. This sounded great. He also told me that I could use expenses to top up my pay by £100 a month when I needed it which I was incredibly unsure about? 

I’m now 32, been at the new company almost a year and a half and not one part of this has come to fruition, over time with wage calculators I’ve realised that I’m now (since April) being paid basically minimum wage, there are no new hires so far, and all that’s happened over the past year is that I’ve taken on more and more jobs/ responsibilities (around 4-5) without compensation. 

For those wondering about my work i have met every deadline, created massive amounts of content, and given them figures proving huge growth for months. I’m good at my job. 

I know it sounds easy to leave but this family member is really close to me, they are the only family member I really have anymore and I don’t want to upset them. I did bring up the topic of how to move up in the company or earn more and I was met with a vague (you need to add value to the company) 

I’m really stuck on what to do now. I’ve always been very ambitious but after that answer I feel pretty dejected and taken advantage of. I feel like this is a massively low wage for a manager at my age in a creative industry and that I’m not being taken seriously as an adult. 

Where do I go from here? I’m not even sure how to handle this?

TLDR: worked with a family member since I was 14 on and off, at 18 I was being paid 20k I’m now  32 and being paid 24k, I’ve asked about pay rises and promotions but been met with a vague “you have to add value to the company” despite increasing my workload massively over the last year, I don’t want to upset this family member as they’re basically all I have left

1jychq5,https://i.redd.it/lttndkbfwmue1.jpeg,Alden Indy Ravello Shell after 7 year wait. Error made.,"Hey all. It’s been a while since I’ve participated in this sub as I’ve been very happy with my Carmina jumpers, Alden cap toe boots, and other GYW boots I acquired about 5-7 years ago. Here is my experience on getting my first, new pair of rare shell Aldens. 

In 2018, I got on TSM’s waitlist for Alden rare shell, hoping for a cap toe or an Indy in cigar or Ravello. I got my first email in about 2021 for a long wing boot but passed on it. Next up was a split-toe about a year later. 

In July 2024, I got an email about an Indy ravello. I finally got what I was patiently waiting for! Spec: Indy ravello, commando sole, 360 welt, antique edge, on a turbulence last. 

I sent in a check, which was definitely sketchy, but a bit of research showed antiquated processes are still their way of receiving payment. A week later, I received a confirmation email for my order. 

After about an 8 month wait, I received them 3 weeks ago. I finally had the time to open them up this morning over a cup of coffee. I felt like a kid opening the iconic green box from Alden. Inside, a remarkable shade of Ravello made up these boots. The way the morning light hit them made me appreciate the 7 year wait even more. 

I slipped on a pair of clean socks, put on the right boot, and laced it up. Once I tied the knot, I immediately realized I ordered the wrong size. Shame. I didn’t even have to take a step to know I needed a C width, not a D. I took off the pair and pulled out the phone to find info on last sizing. 

Alden last charts show Trubalance needed to be sized down compared to a Grant last. I have a pair of Grant-last cap toe boots in 9.5D, so I based my sizing off of that when I ordered.

Huge error on my part. I should’ve done more research before ordering my pair, especially given how long I waited. Now, I will reluctantly have to trade or buy a new pair. Don’t be like me and take the time to do your research online or go into a store to try on a pair on the specific last.",20,1744563989.0,goodyearwelt,9,0.92,False

---

""Uncle Paul! Uncle Paul!""

My nephew Isaac runs up to me as soon as I step into the house. I don't smile, much as I would love to. I ruffle his hair instead and bask in the warm inner glow. 

I do my best to be a good uncle. I play with him, ask him about school and friends. Isabel tells me he loves my visits, mostly.  

But there is one thing about them he doesn't like. 

Isaac flips through the joke book in his hand. He had his finger in it to mark a page but lost track in his excitement. I can't help but wince. He must have combed through every page in the book to pick out the funniest joke he could find. Narrowing down his favorites to find the one I would like best. 

All in an effort to evoke the one response I can never give. 

""Knock knock!"" he finally reads. 

""Who's there?"" I say dutifully.

Isaac smiles, already starting to giggle. ""Iran!"" 

""Iran who?""

""Iran all the way here and now I'm tired!"" he yells with glee. Then he looks at me, waiting for my reaction.

""Oh, I see."" I keep the amusement I feel carefully out of my face and voice. ""It's a pun based on the name of the country and the phrase 'I ran'. That's good. That's very funny.""

His face falls. Six years old and he already knows the fundamental rule of comedy. If you have to explain the joke, it's not funny. 

""Isaac,"" my sister calls to him. ""It's nearly lunchtime. Put that joke book down and come help set the table.""

""One day I'll find a joke you actually like,"" he mumbles.

He tosses the book onto the couch and obediently sets off to his task. I close it and set the book neatly on the coffee table as soon as he leaves.

After the meal, while Isaac is absorbed in his joke book, Isabel takes me aside. 

""Paul,"" she says. ""Why are you doing this? You used to be able to crack a smile at least."" 

I wish I could explain, but the terms of my deal were clear. Even smiling at the bitter irony is out of the question. 

""I can't tell you,"" I settle on saying. It was true: I'd made the deal for my sister but she could know nothing of it, not even with a vague hint, or I would be considered in breach of contract and dealt with accordingly. They hadn't needed to explain what they would do to Isaac.

My sister sighs. ""You *are* happy for me, right? You care about your nephew?"" 

Stone-faced, I nod. 

""Good,"" she says. ""You could at least let him know you like his jokes."" 

I *had*, but I was starting to think words of praise and appreciation weren't enough. Isaac needed something more immediate than that. The instinctive reaction from the burst of delight and surprise at a well-timed punchline, coming from a deeper level than speech.

The very thing I'd traded away to fulfil my sister's dearest wish. 

The traders come to our village every winter, offering wondrous and impossible things for strange bargains. And Isabel wanted to be a mother more than anything. She and her husband had been trying for years but to no avail. I saw the sadness in her eyes with each failed pregnancy. She would take one of those deals sooner or later: something precious and irreplaceable for a child of her own. 

So I approached them first. 

I hadn't been sure the traders would bargain with me: I had no wife nor children for the goodly traders to take, no skill or talent or dream to catch their eye. I was nothing and no one and nobody would ever love me, but I could help my sister with this. Even if the price they ended up demanding was steeper than I'd imagined, I was willing to pay it. 

It didn't matter what the other villagers said about me. Arrogant, overly serious, a relentless pedant: I embraced that persona, wore it like armor against the prospect of breaking the contract. Until Isaac reached that special age where he started figuring out jokes. 

The deal I made looks set to drive a wedge between us. Maybe this was their plan all along. 

And yet, seeing Isaac run into my sister's arms, babbling a mile a minute as he tries his hand at devising his own jokes, I can't tell myself I would have chosen differently.",2,1744563829.0,WritingPrompts,1,1.0,False

We want to see a lot but I also do not want to fall into the trap of overplanning. We love hiking, eating (love sushi and ramen), sightseeing and my wife definitely wants to see Disney Sea. On our bigger trips we usually walk 15-25k steps and we are fine with that, with maybe 1 or 2 slower days. We would also like to get up early to beat the crowds where possible.

As we are still far away from the trip, the itinerary at this point may be rough, I would just love to hear your opinion if it is doable and enjoyable:

* **Nov. 3 Tokyo** First part in Tokyo, landing on 3rd of November afternoon, pretty much just arrive at our hotel and a bit sightseeing in the evening and sleep. I have saved some hotels for later in the area of Shinjuku, Akasaka, Shinbashi and Ginza. Would it be better to stay first in let's say Shinjuku and for the second part in Shinbashi or it does not matter much?

* **Nov. 4 Tokyo** explore Tokyo, Shibuya crossing, specialty coffee in glitch or Apollon's gold (will take recommendations if you know good pourover places). Imperial palace and have a dinner somewhere with Tokyo skyline, preferably ramen

* **Nov. 5 Tokyo** Shinjuku Garden, Government Building Observation tower, Meiji Jinju Shrine and Yoyogi Park.

* **Nov. 6 Tokyo** Tsukiji fish market, TeamLab Planets, walk around Odaiba for a couple hours after. Shipping big luggage forward to Osaka

* **Nov. 7 Kanazawa** Traveling to Kanazawa in the morning. Kenrouken Gardens, Kanazawa Castle, Ochimi Market

* **Nov. 8 Kanazawa** Higashi - Chaya District, ninja temple and nagamachi district if time allows. Traveling to Osaka in the afternoon or evening.

* **Nov. 9 Osaka** Starting in the morning: Dotonbori, Aquarium, Umeda Sky Building

* **Nov. 10 Osaka** Osaka Castle and half-day trip to Kobe to have a Kobe beef dinner and then going back to Osaka for the evening. Sending forward luggages to Kyoto and traveling light to Miyajima

* **Nov. 11 Miyajima & Hiroshima** Traveling to Miyajima on the 11th, Itsukushima Shrine is a definite must see and we would love to hike Mt. Misen, in your opinion should it be sunset or sunrise the next morning? We would stay in a fancier Hotel / Ryokan here, Kikunoya or Iwaso is the top 2 I have checked so far

* **Nov. 12 Miyajima & Hiroshima** Early morning hike to Mt. Misen, depending on the previous day or just a bit more laid back morning, watching the Tori gate maybe and then going over to Hiroshima for the Peace Museum. Leaving in the evening to Kyoto.

* **Nov. 13 Kyoto** Possible slow day on the 13th for the first day in Kyoto.

* **Nov. 14 Kyoto** Yasaka Shrine, Hanamikoji-dori, Shinbashi-dori, Shirakawa Lane, Gion Tatsumi Bridge, Minamiza Theater, Shijoo Bridge, Pontocho Park

* **Nov. 15 Kyoto** Fushimi Inari, Kiyomizu-dera, Hōkan-ji, Sannenzaka, Ninenzaka, Maruyama Park, Chionin, Shōrenin

* **Nov. 16 Kyoto** Full day trip to Nara

* **Nov. 17 Kyoto** Nishiki Market, Teramachi-dori, Daimaru Dept Store, Isuien Garden, Todai-ji Namdaimon, Nigatsudo. Ship luggages forward to Tokyo and sleep early so we can leave the next day early to Lake Kawaguchiko.

* **Nov. 18 Lake Kawaguchiko** I have saved a hotel with private Onsen here (Fujikawaguchiko Onsen Konanso) to have another slow day with Onsen and a possible great view if the weather wills it so. I do not know if we should just spend one night here, leaving Kyoto on the 18th morning, sleep here and head to Tokyo or cutting one day off from Kyoto or Tokyo to be here for 2 nights (that would be the max as the hotel is not cheap). What is your opinion on that?

* **Nov. 19 Tokyo** Travel back to Tokyo for our last Hotel. Possibly travel to Kamakura and Yokohama before heading to Tokyo. If that is too much then head to Tokyo, suggestions are very welcome for this day. Possibly Ghibli museum

* **Nov. 20 Tokyo** Ueno Park, Nakamise Street, Akihabara

* **Nov. 21 Tokyo** Disney Sea trip, probably takes the whole day.

* **Nov. 22 Tokyo** Last day, our plane leaves at 10pm so we will have a lot of time but I do not want to overpack this day. Mostly shopping in Uniqlo I think, shop for some good chef knives and have a last sushi feeding for sure and some pourover.

If you could give some general feedback and feedback for the specific questions that would be greatly appreciated. Mostly I would like to know if this itinerary is at all possible with public transportation but as I checked the travel times and based on our previous trips it should be doable but erring on the side of too much maybe?

Ever since I was a kid, I just felt like my mom was always annoyed with me whenever I tried to share my thoughts, opinions, or even just talk about something I was interested in. These days, when I try to have a conversation with her, she constantly interrupts, rushes me to “get to the point,” or says she’s too busy to listen. But a lot of the time, she’s just on her iPad or phone, stirring her coffee, or eating but anytime I try to talk to her about my interests she always seems to be busy.

She’ll only really talk to me if the topic is something she’s interested in, or if it’s about her past. When I was growing up, she’d call me selfish for not thinking about her needs, and sometimes she’d share traumatic stories from her own life, and I was like 6 or 7. She also used to shake me and hit me when I was very little I think 4 or 5 if I wasn't ""behaving"" as she said. It wasn’t until I became an adult that I realized that it was abusive for parents to shake and hit their kids as a form of discipline.

When I’ve tried to bring this stuff up with her, she gets defensive, raises her voice, and accuses me of attacking her. I would literally directly ask if she doesn't like me because every time I try to talk to her, she seems annoyed, which was probably not the best choice, but yeah. One time it escalated so badly I ended up crying in front of another family member, and she called me manipulative for it. She's never apologized to me growing up, either. She always taught me that crying in front of people is “weak,” and now I have a really hard time opening up and expressing myself.

She used to glare at me a lot as a kid or give me this look of total annoyance. When I mentioned to her that she used to glare at me and told me one time that crying was a sign of weakness recently, she said something like, “I said that? That sounds awful, I don't remember saying that.” but then insisted she never glared at me and got mad that I brought it up at all and would raise her voice at me and say I'm just trying to start an argument. I wasn't trying to, I don't think, but maybe it wasn't the best choice to bring it up. I was hoping she would apologize, but she raised her voice at me.

All of this has really messed with how I communicate, especially when talking about things I care about or my interests. I keep thinking people cannot wait for me to stop talking, so I usually reply with very short responses or I talk fast and then just try to focus on the other person more by asking them questions. But I realized recently that it's actually better to be more specific when people ask about your weekend plans or interests so you can see if you have something in common with people. Even when talking to other family members, she somehow makes me feel like I’m being a burden and says things like, ""Oh, they wouldn't get that, or they're busy, leave them be.""

I’m trying to work on moving out, but a part of me keeps wondering if it was something I did. She seemed to be annoyed with me as soon as I was able to form my own opinions, as little as 5, I think. Its hard to remember. A part of me felt that the older I got, the more she seemed to dislike me and the less nice she would be at times. She would tell me she would be upset or hit me cause I would ""defy"" her or not ""respect"" her as she said. Sometimes I snap and lash out when she’s yelling, and once I even said, “This is why I’ll go no contact one day,” and she replied, “That’s great.” It hurt, but a part of me wasn't surprised.

I guess I’m just wondering… has anyone else experienced something similar?",11,1744563152.0,narcissisticparents,7,1.0,False

1jyc3qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleepbutgood/comments/1jyc3qw/the_substitute/,The Substitute,"Mr. Hadley wasn’t anyone’s favorite teacher.

He was mean as a snake. A harsh grader. He’d go off on tangents about topics that were *way* too hard for a sixth-grade class to understand, pause, glare at us like we were stinking up the room, and say, “well, those of you who’ll make it to college *might* learn more about that someday.” He smelled musty, like burnt coffee and old food, and he was more often than not wearing a putrid wool sweater that made me itch just looking at it. He was one of the older teachers at Moreland Middle School—at least he *looked* older, with dorky round glasses and six whole strands of hair—and seemed to deeply resent teaching a class of 12-year-olds with 12-year-old brains.

I was sitting next to Lisa Greene when the test thudded onto my desk. *C-.* I sighed in relief. Lisa glanced over, holding her chin high as she awaited her own test. I tried not to feel inferior as I flipped through the pages, cringing at all the questions that had been marked up in red ink.

Look, it’s not like I was a slacker. Mr. Hadley’s tests were *ridiculous*. He’d had to change them after a few parents complained about the “non-standard content”, and after that he *did* start to follow the standard curriculum, at least, but he still worded things like a sphinx, like he was hoping we’d pick the wrong letter and fall down some secret trapdoor. We’d all heard him grumbling about how “the world wasn’t built for geniuses” and he'd be damned if he was going to “help mediocrity prosper” like the rest of the teachers at Moreland.

The other teachers didn’t like him very much. Shocker, I know. Not even Mrs. Caruso, the English teacher, got along with him, and she didn’t have a mean bone in her body.

I wondered if Hadley had always hated the job so much. I couldn’t imagine a past version of him who didn’t enjoy tormenting children. As much as he already sucked, I swear that he was getting *worse.* Over the last few weeks, he’d been coming into class crankier than ever, and looking exhausted, too. He’d stopped bothering with combing back the six strands haloing his mirrorball head, and he actually wore the puke sweater for 11 days straight (I knew because I kept tallies in my science notebook).

He even yelled at Lisa when she asked a question about mitosis. A stunned silence fell over the class. For a moment, Hadley looked guilty, then his mouth twisted like he tasted something sour and he turned away from the crestfallen girl.

I don’t remember what I was doing on that Thursday evening. Playing video games, then homework, probably. It was probably an ordinary night for everyone except for Hadley. I still wonder what happened that night after he got into his car and drove home.

On Friday morning, he came in a changed man.

A changed man, *with* *candy*. The good stuff, too. Full-size chocolate bars. Instead of pulling up his usual lecture, he turned to us and said, “Good day to you all, my lovely students! Today’s no ordinary day, so why would we have an ordinary class? We’re going to watch a movie!”

I didn’t need to look around the class to sense the astonishment. Was this some kind of cruel trick?

You could hear a pin drop as he put on Osmosis Jones and handed out candy bars from a giant bag, humming cheerily all the time. I broke mine in half before eating to make sure there wasn’t anything nasty in there—nope. Just caramel and nougat.

I kept looking over at Hadley every few minutes from my safe position in the back right corner of the room. He was smiling gleefully behind his desk, his face lit up with an energy that had formerly only been applied to torturing his students. Every so often he’d lean over and scribble something down inside a beaten-up notebook.

That was Friday. The weekend passed with no science homework, for once. Then came Monday.

I was in my usual seat at the back corner of the room when Mr. Hadley walked in, but even from that distance I could tell something was very wrong.

He was taller. More upright, at least, like we were seeing him stand up straight for the first time ever. And had he put on *makeup*?  His skin looked smoother, and his dark circles were gone, so he looked ten years younger. He was wearing new clothes, too. A crisp collared shirt and gray pants, which I know doesn’t sound like the height of fashion or anything, but after the long reign of the puke sweater, he may as well have strolled out of a magazine cover. And he was *smiling.* A weird smile, all white and toothy. It looked painful to hold for too long. He strode to the front of the class, put his hands on his hips, and beamed: “Good morning, class!”

That was Hadley’s voice, but it was like… like somebody else was speaking through his body. Somebody who woke up with little blue birds chirping on his windowsill and mice buttoning up his shirt.

“Now that didn’t get much of a response! Where’s your enthusiasm for learning? GOOD MORNING, CLASS!”

It was quiet enough to hear the clack of Hadley’s teeth as he resumed his freaky smile.

“Today’s topic is energy, kids!” He moved to the whiteboard and wrote *ENERGY* in huge, perfectly neat letters. Even his handwriting was better than before.

“Now, last class we went over the different forms of energy. Who remembers the first law of thermodynamics?”

Lisa Greene’s voice broke the silence. “Um, the first law of thermodynamics is that energy can be neither created or destroyed,” she said quietly.

 Hadley threw his hands into the air, something that he’d only ever done before when ranting about our “bleak futures”. “Bingo, Ms. Greene! Energy can only be converted from one form to another. Now can we get a list going of some of those forms?”

Looking more confident, Lisa started to list off her on fingers. “First, there’s potential and kinetic,” she said. Hadley nodded and wrote down the two categories on the board.

“Kinetic energy—can we get some examples of kinetic energy?”

I raised my hand. “Thermal,” I said, wondering if I was having a weird dream.

Hadley nodded kindly. “Thermal! Yes, the energy of particles in motion. Keep them coming.”

“Um, mechanical,” I said. “And light, and sound, and um, sorry, I don’t remember any more.”

“That’s just fine,” Hadley said with a wave of his hand, and I actually pinched myself. He wrote down the other types on the whiteboard in his brand-new script. “Now, class, energy is a wonderful thing! Look at the lights in this room; feel the air-conditioning keeping you nice and cool. How is that we’ve harnessed the raw materials in the environment to work for our benefit? Well, we humans take the chemical energy in fossil fuels, transform it to kinetic energy as we burn it, and finally that becomes…”

Grace Hammond, who usually spent class trying to text from under her desk, raised her hand. “Electrical energy?”

“Exactly right, Ms. Hammond!”

It was easily the best class that Hadley had ever taught. I kept waiting for him to crack, for him to snap and tell us that none of us were going to graduate high school, but my waiting was in vain.

At lunch, the cafeteria went rabid with theories. Hadley had gotten a lobotomy. Hadley had won the lottery. Hadley had a secret good twin who had killed him and taken his place. Hadley had tripped and bumped his head and gone through a total personality change (Ryan Prescott said it had happened to an uncle of his and so he knew the signs).

Imaginations were running wild, but lots of the kids didn’t believe in the gossip until they saw it for themselves. Pretty soon, kids started filing past the teacher’s lounge to see for themselves. Meera Kapoor reported that apparently the other teachers looked just as astonished as the rest of us. Up until then, Hadley only ever ate his lunch alone in his classroom (the kids he had after lunch period always complained that the room smelled like weird old people food). No longer was that the case: Meera said that Hadley had been sitting at the table in the middle of the lounge, no Tupperware in sight, smiling and chatting up a storm with all the teachers. Meera said that Mrs. Caruso, had even been leaning in and tossing her hair and smiling a little *too* hard, though I’m not sure I believed that.

Round by round, everyone got a taste of new Hadley, and everyone was happy with new Hadley. He never scolded, never handed out detentions, never even asked anyone to put away their phone.

A week passed, and everyone stopped talking about it at lunch, because Chloe Thompson and Jason Wu got lice at the same time and everyone said she’d gotten it from him. But—it wasn’t normal. Nothing about new Hadley was normal. The way he talked, the way he smiled with both rows of teeth on display. The way his voice never strayed from that chipper tone. His tests were easier, and I was getting As in science for the first time, and I guess I really didn’t have anything to complain about—but *man*, it was *weird*.

It could’ve stayed at that level of uneventful weird, if not for Ryan.

It was 2:55 on a Friday when he blew The Spitball.

Of course it happened on a Friday, with everyone itching for the bell and fidgeting in their seats. Ryan, who liked to make trouble in every classroom he entered, had been chewing up bits of paper all throughout class.

Now Hadley’s back was turned while he was erasing the whiteboard, and Ryan aimed his straw at Hadley’s back.

*Phip.* The little white ball flew through the air and bounced off our teacher’s neck.

He didn’t notice.

Ryan sniggered, and his group of wannabee-Ryans elbowed each other and grinned.

He blew another spitball. Lisa stared hatefully at him.

*Phip.* The little ball hit the nape of Hadley’s neck and slid down the back of shirt. Another round of giggles from Ryan’s gang.

Our teacher turned around, smiling obliviously, and said, “Well, how about an early dismissal today, kids?”

Only, Ryan had loaded up *another spitball* and the momentum was already going, and I could see the horror spread over his face in the same beat that the spitball exited the end of the straw, and—

It hit Hadley square in the eye. Like, I think it actually bounced against his open eyeball. Hadley blinked slowly. Ryan made a sound like a frightened mouse. A round of gasps went up around the room.

Hadley struck his hands-on-hips pose and said, “Well, that’s all for today, kids!”

The bell rang, and he walked back to his desk.

I stared in disbelief. So did Ryan, and his gang, and Lisa Greene.

The stunned silence lasted only another second before Ryan made a mad grab for his backpack, leading to a shuffle of kids getting up, and we were making our way out into the hallway, then onto the buses.

“Did you see that—”

“Right in the middle of his face?”

“In his *eye!*”

“Like he didn’t even notice…”

Everyone was buzzing around Ryan, and there was a gleam in his eye that made me nervous. “I wasn’t even nervous,” I heard him boasting. “I knew he wasn’t gonna do nothing.”

“That was *so* disrespectful,” Lisa hissed, penetrating into the crowd of newly minted Ryan fans.

He crossed his arms and looked like he was considering sticking out his tongue at her before deciding he was too mature for that. “Was not. Hadley’s a crap teacher anyway.”

“He is *not*.”

“Okay, well, he *used* to be. Now he’s like… high or something all the time,” Ryan said to a round of chortles.

Grace Hammond piped up. “Ryan, did you really mean to hit him or was it an accident?”

“I meant to,” he said casually.

“No way,” Grace scoffed. “If that’s true, then do it again on Monday.”

A round of *oohs* went up. Ryan turned a little pink, then composed himself and shrugged. “Yeah, sure thing. I don’t care.”

Monday rolled around and the class was brimming with anticipation. Nobody was absorbing a word of Hadley’s lecture on the phases of matter (even though it was pretty interesting stuff, honestly, and I wanted to hear more about whatever plasma was). Ryan was sweating bullets next to me, twiddling a straw between his fingers. Two rows ahead of us, Grace kept turning around with a toss of her shiny hair and looking expectantly at Ryan. There were only ten minutes left in class. I saw him take a deep breath and bring the straw to his lips.

“So, heat is the same thing as kinetic energy…”

*Plip!* Nobody could miss the spitball bounce between his eyes.

“…and that is why boiling water causes it to change into the vapor phase. Isn’t that just incredible?”

There had been absolutely no realization in his eyes. None.

One of the rowdier guys in class, Jason Wu, balled up a piece of paper and threw it at Hadley’s back. It hit him and landed on the ground.

No response. Jason couldn’t muffle his giggle. Grace was grinning behind her hands, her eyes wide and gleaming.

The weeks rolled by, and we grew bolder. Hadley would get in maybe ten minutes of actual teaching before the class descended into chatter and horseplay. The annoying thing is that Hadley had finally gotten the hang of teaching in a way that didn’t make me want to flee the country. It was by-the-book, pretty robotic, actually, but that was heaven compared to the lectures he’d been giving before. It was too bad I could hardly absorb the lessons over my rowdy classmates.

About a month into Hadley’s transformation, the class had lost all residual fear of him, like domesticated animals forgetting to be scared around their natural predators. One Monday, Grace took out her phone and started casually scrolling it next to the science workbook we were supposed to be filling out. Hadley furrowed his brow. “No phones during class, Grace,” he said lamely. Everyone froze. Old Hadley would’ve gotten out the bear-safe food locker and made Grace do a walk of shame up to the desk.

New Hadley turned around and finished drawing the structure of sodium chloride with perfect, straight black lines.

Grace exchanged glances and giggles with her best friend, Mona, and kept on scrolling. Ten minutes later, Hadley turned around and squinted in her direction, said “no phones during class,” and continued to talk about ionic bonds.

On Tuesday, we were learning about the differences between plant and animal cells by looking at onion slices under a microscope. I remember the day well because Grace Hammond was my lab partner and it felt like I was half outside my body, watching as I made a big dumb fool of myself. Half of the kids weren’t doing their experiments at all. Ryan was flicking onion bits at his buddies, and they’d made a game of trying to catch it in their mouths. Hadley was walking placidly around the classroom, stopping every now and then to check on a microscope and nod or make a minor adjustment. Even though he creeped me out a little, I *liked* new Hadley—he was helpful. I didn’t get why everyone made such a joke of pushing him around.

As he was walking down the last row, I saw Jason elbow Ryan and snigger something into his ear. I was looking down the barrel of my microscope—was that anaphase?—when I heard a loud thud. I looked up.

Hadley was lying face-first on the floor. Ryan, Jason, and their friends were standing around him with bug eyes and suppressed laughter. Ryan hadn’t even bothered to move his foot from where it was planted in the middle of the row.

Lisa was turning red as she took in the scene. I was on her side, but when I opened my mouth to say something to Ryan, my voice shrank and died in my throat. “You are *bullying* him,” she hissed, and I saw that she was trying not to cry.

“Oh no! Are you okay, *Mister Hadley?*” Ryan said with mock concern. Lots of nervous giggles were going up around the room.

We all watched as Hadley got up from the floor. He did it so smooth and steady you’d never have guessed he’d just been tripped by surprise, pushing himself up on his hands first and then rising to his feet. He brushed off his pants. I could have sworn his forehead looked dented. “Well, excuse me, class,” he said stiffly. “I must have lost my balance.”

And with that, he returned to his desk and spent the rest of the class grading papers. Ryan hi-fived his friends in plain view of everyone.

I went home from school that day feeling shaken. Ryan had always been a jerk, but for the first time, I felt a real stir of hatred for him. My mom noticed that I was upset, but I brushed it off—no matter what happened, I wasn’t going to be the kid who called in the parents to shut things down. On the bright side, she decided to take me out for ice cream, our family’s failsafe method for cheering someone up.

I was walking out of the Baskin Robbins with a loaded rocky-road cone when I saw him. Mr. Hadley. He had just come out of the hardware store carrying two heavy-looking bags, and he was making a beeline for his car. I stopped in my tracks and stared. Was *this* what he did after school? I’d seen in him the wild while out with my family a few times when he was still a miserable old crank, but this was the first time since the personality replacement. He looked… different. How had he been hiding that beer belly in class? And where was the perfect posture? Not only that, but his whole face looked grumpier, his eyes sharper, more *alive*, and I wondered if he taped his face skin back during the school hours or something. Adults did some pretty crazy things when they hit their midlife crises, didn’t they? As ridiculous as that seemed, I couldn’t think of any other explanation for the difference.

The next week, the bright, smiley Hadley was back in class, but the kids were different. It wasn’t just Ryan anymore. Everyone had been emboldened by last week’s incident. Kids talked right over him, and his meek reprimands had zero effect. It got worse every day, and I was at a loss for why Hadley was allowing it to happen. On Tuesday, he got tripped *again*, this time by scrawny Stewart Fogel, who until then I’d always thought was as incapable of misbehaving as Lisa. He got up without a word. On Wednesday, Jason Wu came in early to put a thumbtack on his chair, and the whole class watched with baited breath as he sat down on it and… nothing. He didn’t even exhale. We all saw the thumbtack poking out of his pants when he turned around, too. That started the rumor that Hadley wore ten layers of underwear. On Thursday, Grace brought a roll of toilet paper from the girl’s bathroom and wrapped it around his leg while Mona distracted him with questions about the homework. He walked around the rest of the class with the paper trailing behind him, refusing to acknowledge it.

The next week, it was clear that Hadley was off his game. There was one class period where Lisa raised her hand three times before he noticed her. At one point he stood in front of the whiteboard with an uncapped marker for what felt like five minutes before shaking his head and sitting back down, the board blank as snow. I felt bad. If he really had bumped his head and lost his ability to stand up to his students, how far were we going to push it?

On Thursday, we got to class and there was no Hadley present. No substitute, either.

“It’s been fifteen minutes, that means we can leave,” Jason Wu chirped up after three minutes had elapsed.

“No, it doesn’t,” Lisa said.

“Lisa’s going to tell the principal,” moaned Mona.

Grace chimed in.  “Lisa, you’re not gonna do that, are you? You’re not gonna ruin it for everyone?”

“No, I guess I’m not,” Lisa said, thin-lipped.

I guess none of the other teachers bothered to look into the room as they walked by, because we passed the period drawing on the whiteboards and dicking around.

The next day, we arrived again to an empty classroom. It was a Friday, and there was an energy of mischief crackling in the air. It was in the way Ryan and his wannabees strutted into the room, shoving each other around as they filed in, and how Grace’s clique giggled and whispered to each other in the circle of chairs they’d arranged at the back of class. Lisa was sitting stiffly at her desk, trying not to make eye contact with anyone.

“Bet he died and the school just hasn’t noticed yet,” Ryan said. “You know what that means, right, guys?”

“It means we can do whatever we want,” Jason said, jumping up on a table.

“You guys,” Lisa said in a small voice. “We should just wait a few minutes.”

“Or we get to have fun,” Ryan said, rolling his eyes. “Turn down the lights!” One of the guys ran to the light switches and dimmed them so the familiar room fell into shadows. It looked bigger when it was dark. A few yelps went up from the crowd before dissolving into giggles and shouts. People got out of their desks and went to go chat with their friends. Furniture was shuffled and rearranged.

Somebody started playing music—loud, thumping music that spiked my nerves like someone drumming on my spine.

There was a new sound, too, one of jangling glass. I looked up. Jason had somehow found the key to the equipment cabinets and was rifling through the glass beakers and tubes. In the dark, I couldn’t see if he did it on purpose or not, but we all heard the crash of a rack of test tubes splintering on the ground.

Somebody screeched in the dark. Jason laughed, and it was like a contagion: everyone else laughed too. I even found myself laughing.

“Guys, *stop* it, or I’m going to call a teacher,” Lisa said, louder this time.

*Thwock*. Something bounced off of Lisa’s forehead and thumped onto the ground. She looked down. So did everyone else. A pink eraser.

This time, the laughter ripped shamelessly through the room, drowning out any protestations. I felt myself laughing too. It was so loud that nobody noticed the door clicking open. Nobody noticed the adult marching his way to the front of the room. Nobody noticed until—

“*WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?”*

Was this really the same calm, smiling Hadley from only three days ago? He was standing purple-faced with his eyes bulging, his head poking out of that putrid green sweater like a turtle sticking out of its shell. His bellow *should* have been terrifying. A month and a half ago, that would’ve had everyone freezing on the spot and awaiting their doom.

Now, it only made everyone laugh harder. It was just *Hadley.* Not like he was going to do anything.

“Hey guys, let’s give him a big welcome!” Ryan shouted.

I don’t know who threw the first projectile. Maybe Jason, maybe one of the nerdy kids. It could’ve been anyone. *Whack!* The pencil struck Hadley in the forehead, point first, leaving a dot of graphite above his eyebrows. For a moment, he stood stock-still, his eyes bulging out of his head.

A fresh wave of shouts and chortles. I couldn’t help it—I felt it bubbling out of my mouth again. The image of Hadley standing there with the pencil mark on his face, his mouth hanging open—it was *funny*. He was shouting something now, but nobody could hear it above our laughter. More kids were climbing up on the tables. I saw a girl rifling through her backpack, her face obscured by the dark. In fact, it was hard to see who anyone was other than Hadley.

A small object whizzed through the air and smacked Hadley on the side of the head. Maybe another pencil. If you thought he couldn’t get any angrier, *boy*. Then another, and another, and other. It was hard to tell what was being thrown: Erasers? Balled-up paper? Packs of gum? Anything we had at hand was getting chucked. I saw Lisa trying to get to the door, but everyone was jostling her, making it hard for her move more than a few feet.

I was getting left out; I needed to act before I got hit, too. My arm reached for a pencil sharpener and pitched it across the room. I don’t know if it hit him. I couldn’t see much of what was happening anymore; I was one of the few kids who wasn’t standing on the tables.

Still, I was part of the festivities. It was *fun.*

The projectiles were getting bigger. Notebooks. Pencil cases. Shoes.

You could barely hear the shouts of indignation through the laughter. You could barely hear them turn to shouts of pain.

Then, the sound of shattered glass; a pretty, twinkling sound.

Somebody perched on a chair was handing beakers and test tubes to the waiting hands below. Somebody handing out scissors.

*Crash! Crash! Crash!* Explosions of glass, everywhere.

Screams not like a grown man would make, but high-pitched, cartoonish. Funny screams. Fake screams.

Laughter.

A textbook arcing through the air, coming down with the kind of thud you hear in cartoons.

More laughter, mad laughter.

Someone jumped down from a table. Impossible to tell who, in the dark. I saw their knees bend like they were Mario prepared to stomp on a Goomba.

A funny sound, cracking and wet at the same time. Imagine encrusting a water balloon in concrete, then popping the whole thing. Krak-sploosh!

Laughter like hyenas. More dancing bodies jumping down from the tables. Hands sweeping across shelves, seeking any straggling glass or metal. Music pounding, turning the classroom into a disco, the glass crunching in tune with the beat.

We couldn’t see a thing. That’s what they said after. That’s how they said it got out of control.

There’s a piece of that day that’s just fallen out of my head. Between the height of the laughter and the glass and the screams and the silence after, silence that seems sudden in my recollection, but I know that wasn’t the case. I know it must’ve died down bit by bit. But in my head it’s like a time skip. Like waking up from a dream.

Like all of us waking up at once.

The lights came on. Lisa Greene was standing at the doorway, her face covered in scratches. Mrs. Caruso, was standing behind her. The class looked like a hurricane had ran through it.

And at the eye of the storm?

Everyone stared wordlessly at the center of the room, seeing the red mess.

Poor Mrs. Caruso began to scream.",1,1744563006.0,nosleepbutgood,0,1.0,False

1jyc30v,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jyc30v/the_substitute/,The Substitute,"Mr. Hadley wasn’t anyone’s favorite teacher.

He was mean as a snake. A harsh grader. He’d go off on tangents about topics that were *way* too hard for a sixth-grade class to understand, pause, glare at us like we were stinking up the room, and say, “well, those of you who’ll make it to college *might* learn more about that someday.” He smelled musty, like burnt coffee and old food, and he was more often than not wearing a putrid wool sweater that made me itch just looking at it. He was one of the older teachers at Moreland Middle School—at least he *looked* older, with dorky round glasses and six whole strands of hair—and seemed to deeply resent teaching a class of 12-year-olds with 12-year-old brains.

I was sitting next to Lisa Greene when the test thudded onto my desk. *C-.* I sighed in relief. Lisa glanced over, holding her chin high as she awaited her own test. I tried not to feel inferior as I flipped through the pages, cringing at all the questions that had been marked up in red ink.

Look, it’s not like I was a slacker. Mr. Hadley’s tests were *ridiculous*. He’d had to change them after a few parents complained about the “non-standard content”, and after that he *did* start to follow the standard curriculum, at least, but he still worded things like a sphinx, like he was hoping we’d pick the wrong letter and fall down some secret trapdoor. We’d all heard him grumbling about how “the world wasn’t built for geniuses” and he'd be damned if he was going to “help mediocrity prosper” like the rest of the teachers at Moreland.

The other teachers didn’t like him very much. Shocker, I know. Not even Mrs. Caruso, the English teacher, got along with him, and she didn’t have a mean bone in her body.

I wondered if Hadley had always hated the job so much. I couldn’t imagine a past version of him who didn’t enjoy tormenting children. As much as he already sucked, I swear that he was getting *worse.* Over the last few weeks, he’d been coming into class crankier than ever, and looking exhausted, too. He’d stopped bothering with combing back the six strands haloing his mirrorball head, and he actually wore the puke sweater for 11 days straight (I knew because I kept tallies in my science notebook).

He even yelled at Lisa when she asked a question about mitosis. A stunned silence fell over the class. For a moment, Hadley looked guilty, then his mouth twisted like he tasted something sour and he turned away from the crestfallen girl.

I don’t remember what I was doing on that Thursday evening. Playing video games, then homework, probably. It was probably an ordinary night for everyone except for Hadley. I still wonder what happened that night after he got into his car and drove home.

On Friday morning, he came in a changed man.

A changed man, *with* *candy*. The good stuff, too. Full-size chocolate bars. Instead of pulling up his usual lecture, he turned to us and said, “Good day to you all, my lovely students! Today’s no ordinary day, so why would we have an ordinary class? We’re going to watch a movie!”

I didn’t need to look around the class to sense the astonishment. Was this some kind of cruel trick?

You could hear a pin drop as he put on Osmosis Jones and handed out candy bars from a giant bag, humming cheerily all the time. I broke mine in half before eating to make sure there wasn’t anything nasty in there—nope. Just caramel and nougat.

I kept looking over at Hadley every few minutes from my safe position in the back right corner of the room. He was smiling gleefully behind his desk, his face lit up with an energy that had formerly only been applied to torturing his students. Every so often he’d lean over and scribble something down inside a beaten-up notebook.

That was Friday. The weekend passed with no science homework, for once. Then came Monday.

I was in my usual seat at the back corner of the room when Mr. Hadley walked in, but even from that distance I could tell something was very wrong.

He was taller. More upright, at least, like we were seeing him stand up straight for the first time ever. And had he put on *makeup*?  His skin looked smoother, and his dark circles were gone, so he looked ten years younger. He was wearing new clothes, too. A crisp collared shirt and gray pants, which I know doesn’t sound like the height of fashion or anything, but after the long reign of the puke sweater, he may as well have strolled out of a magazine cover. And he was *smiling.* A weird smile, all white and toothy. It looked painful to hold for too long. He strode to the front of the class, put his hands on his hips, and beamed: “Good morning, class!”

That was Hadley’s voice, but it was like… like somebody else was speaking through his body. Somebody who woke up with little blue birds chirping on his windowsill and mice buttoning up his shirt.

“Now that didn’t get much of a response! Where’s your enthusiasm for learning? GOOD MORNING, CLASS!”

It was quiet enough to hear the clack of Hadley’s teeth as he resumed his freaky smile.

“Today’s topic is energy, kids!” He moved to the whiteboard and wrote *ENERGY* in huge, perfectly neat letters. Even his handwriting was better than before.

“Now, last class we went over the different forms of energy. Who remembers the first law of thermodynamics?”

Lisa Greene’s voice broke the silence. “Um, the first law of thermodynamics is that energy can be neither created or destroyed,” she said quietly.

 Hadley threw his hands into the air, something that he’d only ever done before when ranting about our “bleak futures”. “Bingo, Ms. Greene! Energy can only be converted from one form to another. Now can we get a list going of some of those forms?”

Looking more confident, Lisa started to list off her on fingers. “First, there’s potential and kinetic,” she said. Hadley nodded and wrote down the two categories on the board.

“Kinetic energy—can we get some examples of kinetic energy?”

I raised my hand. “Thermal,” I said, wondering if I was having a weird dream.

Hadley nodded kindly. “Thermal! Yes, the energy of particles in motion. Keep them coming.”

“Um, mechanical,” I said. “And light, and sound, and um, sorry, I don’t remember any more.”

“That’s just fine,” Hadley said with a wave of his hand, and I actually pinched myself. He wrote down the other types on the whiteboard in his brand-new script. “Now, class, energy is a wonderful thing! Look at the lights in this room; feel the air-conditioning keeping you nice and cool. How is that we’ve harnessed the raw materials in the environment to work for our benefit? Well, we humans take the chemical energy in fossil fuels, transform it to kinetic energy as we burn it, and finally that becomes…”

Grace Hammond, who usually spent class trying to text from under her desk, raised her hand. “Electrical energy?”

“Exactly right, Ms. Hammond!”

It was easily the best class that Hadley had ever taught. I kept waiting for him to crack, for him to snap and tell us that none of us were going to graduate high school, but my waiting was in vain.

At lunch, the cafeteria went rabid with theories. Hadley had gotten a lobotomy. Hadley had won the lottery. Hadley had a secret good twin who had killed him and taken his place. Hadley had tripped and bumped his head and gone through a total personality change (Ryan Prescott said it had happened to an uncle of his and so he knew the signs).

Imaginations were running wild, but lots of the kids didn’t believe in the gossip until they saw it for themselves. Pretty soon, kids started filing past the teacher’s lounge to see for themselves. Meera Kapoor reported that apparently the other teachers looked just as astonished as the rest of us. Up until then, Hadley only ever ate his lunch alone in his classroom (the kids he had after lunch period always complained that the room smelled like weird old people food). No longer was that the case: Meera said that Hadley had been sitting at the table in the middle of the lounge, no Tupperware in sight, smiling and chatting up a storm with all the teachers. Meera said that Mrs. Caruso, had even been leaning in and tossing her hair and smiling a little *too* hard, though I’m not sure I believed that.

Round by round, everyone got a taste of new Hadley, and everyone was happy with new Hadley. He never scolded, never handed out detentions, never even asked anyone to put away their phone.

A week passed, and everyone stopped talking about it at lunch, because Chloe Thompson and Jason Wu got lice at the same time and everyone said she’d gotten it from him. But—it wasn’t normal. Nothing about new Hadley was normal. The way he talked, the way he smiled with both rows of teeth on display. The way his voice never strayed from that chipper tone. His tests were easier, and I was getting As in science for the first time, and I guess I really didn’t have anything to complain about—but *man*, it was *weird*.

It could’ve stayed at that level of uneventful weird, if not for Ryan.

It was 2:55 on a Friday when he blew The Spitball.

Of course it happened on a Friday, with everyone itching for the bell and fidgeting in their seats. Ryan, who liked to make trouble in every classroom he entered, had been chewing up bits of paper all throughout class.

Now Hadley’s back was turned while he was erasing the whiteboard, and Ryan aimed his straw at Hadley’s back.

*Phip.* The little white ball flew through the air and bounced off our teacher’s neck.

He didn’t notice.

Ryan sniggered, and his group of wannabee-Ryans elbowed each other and grinned.

He blew another spitball. Lisa stared hatefully at him.

*Phip.* The little ball hit the nape of Hadley’s neck and slid down the back of shirt. Another round of giggles from Ryan’s gang.

Our teacher turned around, smiling obliviously, and said, “Well, how about an early dismissal today, kids?”

Only, Ryan had loaded up *another spitball* and the momentum was already going, and I could see the horror spread over his face in the same beat that the spitball exited the end of the straw, and—

It hit Hadley square in the eye. Like, I think it actually bounced against his open eyeball. Hadley blinked slowly. Ryan made a sound like a frightened mouse. A round of gasps went up around the room.

Hadley struck his hands-on-hips pose and said, “Well, that’s all for today, kids!”

The bell rang, and he walked back to his desk.

I stared in disbelief. So did Ryan, and his gang, and Lisa Greene.

The stunned silence lasted only another second before Ryan made a mad grab for his backpack, leading to a shuffle of kids getting up, and we were making our way out into the hallway, then onto the buses.

“Did you see that—”

“Right in the middle of his face?”

“In his *eye!*”

“Like he didn’t even notice…”

Everyone was buzzing around Ryan, and there was a gleam in his eye that made me nervous. “I wasn’t even nervous,” I heard him boasting. “I knew he wasn’t gonna do nothing.”

“That was *so* disrespectful,” Lisa hissed, penetrating into the crowd of newly minted Ryan fans.

He crossed his arms and looked like he was considering sticking out his tongue at her before deciding he was too mature for that. “Was not. Hadley’s a crap teacher anyway.”

“He is *not*.”

“Okay, well, he *used* to be. Now he’s like… high or something all the time,” Ryan said to a round of chortles.

Grace Hammond piped up. “Ryan, did you really mean to hit him or was it an accident?”

“I meant to,” he said casually.

“No way,” Grace scoffed. “If that’s true, then do it again on Monday.”

A round of *oohs* went up. Ryan turned a little pink, then composed himself and shrugged. “Yeah, sure thing. I don’t care.”

Monday rolled around and the class was brimming with anticipation. Nobody was absorbing a word of Hadley’s lecture on the phases of matter (even though it was pretty interesting stuff, honestly, and I wanted to hear more about whatever plasma was). Ryan was sweating bullets next to me, twiddling a straw between his fingers. Two rows ahead of us, Grace kept turning around with a toss of her shiny hair and looking expectantly at Ryan. There were only ten minutes left in class. I saw him take a deep breath and bring the straw to his lips.

“So, heat is the same thing as kinetic energy…”

*Plip!* Nobody could miss the spitball bounce between his eyes.

“…and that is why boiling water causes it to change into the vapor phase. Isn’t that just incredible?”

There had been absolutely no realization in his eyes. None.

One of the rowdier guys in class, Jason Wu, balled up a piece of paper and threw it at Hadley’s back. It hit him and landed on the ground.

No response. Jason couldn’t muffle his giggle. Grace was grinning behind her hands, her eyes wide and gleaming.

The weeks rolled by, and we grew bolder. Hadley would get in maybe ten minutes of actual teaching before the class descended into chatter and horseplay. The annoying thing is that Hadley had finally gotten the hang of teaching in a way that didn’t make me want to flee the country. It was by-the-book, pretty robotic, actually, but that was heaven compared to the lectures he’d been giving before. It was too bad I could hardly absorb the lessons over my rowdy classmates.

About a month into Hadley’s transformation, the class had lost all residual fear of him, like domesticated animals forgetting to be scared around their natural predators. One Monday, Grace took out her phone and started casually scrolling it next to the science workbook we were supposed to be filling out. Hadley furrowed his brow. “No phones during class, Grace,” he said lamely. Everyone froze. Old Hadley would’ve gotten out the bear-safe food locker and made Grace do a walk of shame up to the desk.

New Hadley turned around and finished drawing the structure of sodium chloride with perfect, straight black lines.

Grace exchanged glances and giggles with her best friend, Mona, and kept on scrolling. Ten minutes later, Hadley turned around and squinted in her direction, said “no phones during class,” and continued to talk about ionic bonds.

On Tuesday, we were learning about the differences between plant and animal cells by looking at onion slices under a microscope. I remember the day well because Grace Hammond was my lab partner and it felt like I was half outside my body, watching as I made a big dumb fool of myself. Half of the kids weren’t doing their experiments at all. Ryan was flicking onion bits at his buddies, and they’d made a game of trying to catch it in their mouths. Hadley was walking placidly around the classroom, stopping every now and then to check on a microscope and nod or make a minor adjustment. Even though he creeped me out a little, I *liked* new Hadley—he was helpful. I didn’t get why everyone made such a joke of pushing him around.

As he was walking down the last row, I saw Jason elbow Ryan and snigger something into his ear. I was looking down the barrel of my microscope—was that anaphase?—when I heard a loud thud. I looked up.

Hadley was lying face-first on the floor. Ryan, Jason, and their friends were standing around him with bug eyes and suppressed laughter. Ryan hadn’t even bothered to move his foot from where it was planted in the middle of the row.

Lisa was turning red as she took in the scene. I was on her side, but when I opened my mouth to say something to Ryan, my voice shrank and died in my throat. “You are *bullying* him,” she hissed, and I saw that she was trying not to cry.

“Oh no! Are you okay, *Mister Hadley?*” Ryan said with mock concern. Lots of nervous giggles were going up around the room.

We all watched as Hadley got up from the floor. He did it so smooth and steady you’d never have guessed he’d just been tripped by surprise, pushing himself up on his hands first and then rising to his feet. He brushed off his pants. I could have sworn his forehead looked dented. “Well, excuse me, class,” he said stiffly. “I must have lost my balance.”

And with that, he returned to his desk and spent the rest of the class grading papers. Ryan hi-fived his friends in plain view of everyone.

I went home from school that day feeling shaken. Ryan had always been a jerk, but for the first time, I felt a real stir of hatred for him. My mom noticed that I was upset, but I brushed it off—no matter what happened, I wasn’t going to be the kid who called in the parents to shut things down. On the bright side, she decided to take me out for ice cream, our family’s failsafe method for cheering someone up.

I was walking out of the Baskin Robbins with a loaded rocky-road cone when I saw him. Mr. Hadley. He had just come out of the hardware store carrying two heavy-looking bags, and he was making a beeline for his car. I stopped in my tracks and stared. Was *this* what he did after school? I’d seen in him the wild while out with my family a few times when he was still a miserable old crank, but this was the first time since the personality replacement. He looked… different. How had he been hiding that beer belly in class? And where was the perfect posture? Not only that, but his whole face looked grumpier, his eyes sharper, more *alive*, and I wondered if he taped his face skin back during the school hours or something. Adults did some pretty crazy things when they hit their midlife crises, didn’t they? As ridiculous as that seemed, I couldn’t think of any other explanation for the difference.

The next week, the bright, smiley Hadley was back in class, but the kids were different. It wasn’t just Ryan anymore. Everyone had been emboldened by last week’s incident. Kids talked right over him, and his meek reprimands had zero effect. It got worse every day, and I was at a loss for why Hadley was allowing it to happen. On Tuesday, he got tripped *again*, this time by scrawny Stewart Fogel, who until then I’d always thought was as incapable of misbehaving as Lisa. He got up without a word. On Wednesday, Jason Wu came in early to put a thumbtack on his chair, and the whole class watched with baited breath as he sat down on it and… nothing. He didn’t even exhale. We all saw the thumbtack poking out of his pants when he turned around, too. That started the rumor that Hadley wore ten layers of underwear. On Thursday, Grace brought a roll of toilet paper from the girl’s bathroom and wrapped it around his leg while Mona distracted him with questions about the homework. He walked around the rest of the class with the paper trailing behind him, refusing to acknowledge it.

The next week, it was clear that Hadley was off his game. There was one class period where Lisa raised her hand three times before he noticed her. At one point he stood in front of the whiteboard with an uncapped marker for what felt like five minutes before shaking his head and sitting back down, the board blank as snow. I felt bad. If he really had bumped his head and lost his ability to stand up to his students, how far were we going to push it?

On Thursday, we got to class and there was no Hadley present. No substitute, either.

“It’s been fifteen minutes, that means we can leave,” Jason Wu chirped up after three minutes had elapsed.

It looked bigger when it was dark. A few yelps went up from the crowd before dissolving into giggles and shouts. People got out of their desks and went to go chat with their friends. Furniture was shuffled and rearranged.

Somebody started playing music—loud, thumping music that spiked my nerves like someone drumming on my spine.

There was a new sound, too, one of jangling glass. I looked up. Jason had somehow found the key to the equipment cabinets and was rifling through the glass beakers and tubes. In the dark, I couldn’t see if he did it on purpose or not, but we all heard the crash of a rack of test tubes splintering on the ground.

Somebody screeched in the dark. Jason laughed, and it was like a contagion: everyone else laughed too. I even found myself laughing.

“Guys, *stop* it, or I’m going to call a teacher,” Lisa said, louder this time.

*Thwock*. Something bounced off of Lisa’s forehead and thumped onto the ground. She looked down. So did everyone else. A pink eraser.

This time, the laughter ripped shamelessly through the room, drowning out any protestations. I felt myself laughing too. It was so loud that nobody noticed the door clicking open. Nobody noticed the adult marching his way to the front of the room. Nobody noticed until—

“*WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?”*

Was this really the same calm, smiling Hadley from only three days ago? He was standing purple-faced with his eyes bulging, his head poking out of that putrid green sweater like a turtle sticking out of its shell. His bellow *should* have been terrifying. A month and a half ago, that would’ve had everyone freezing on the spot and awaiting their doom.

Now, it only made everyone laugh harder. It was just *Hadley.* Not like he was going to do anything.

“Hey guys, let’s give him a big welcome!” Ryan shouted.

I don’t know who threw the first projectile. Maybe Jason, maybe one of the nerdy kids. It could’ve been anyone. *Whack!* The pencil struck Hadley in the forehead, point first, leaving a dot of graphite above his eyebrows. For a moment, he stood stock-still, his eyes bulging out of his head.

A fresh wave of shouts and chortles. I couldn’t help it—I felt it bubbling out of my mouth again. The image of Hadley standing there with the pencil mark on his face, his mouth hanging open—it was *funny*. He was shouting something now, but nobody could hear it above our laughter. More kids were climbing up on the tables. I saw a girl rifling through her backpack, her face obscured by the dark. In fact, it was hard to see who anyone was other than Hadley.

A small object whizzed through the air and smacked Hadley on the side of the head. Maybe another pencil. If you thought he couldn’t get any angrier, *boy*. Then another, and another, and other. It was hard to tell what was being thrown: Erasers? Balled-up paper? Packs of gum? Anything we had at hand was getting chucked. I saw Lisa trying to get to the door, but everyone was jostling her, making it hard for her move more than a few feet.

I was getting left out; I needed to act before I got hit, too. My arm reached for a pencil sharpener and pitched it across the room. I don’t know if it hit him. I couldn’t see much of what was happening anymore; I was one of the few kids who wasn’t standing on the tables.

Still, I was part of the festivities. It was *fun.*

The projectiles were getting bigger. Notebooks. Pencil cases. Shoes.

You could barely hear the shouts of indignation through the laughter. You could barely hear them turn to shouts of pain.

Then, the sound of shattered glass; a pretty, twinkling sound.

Somebody perched on a chair was handing beakers and test tubes to the waiting hands below. Somebody handing out scissors.

*Crash! Crash! Crash!* Explosions of glass, everywhere.

Screams not like a grown man would make, but high-pitched, cartoonish. Funny screams. Fake screams.

Laughter.

A textbook arcing through the air, coming down with the kind of thud you hear in cartoons.

More laughter, mad laughter.

Someone jumped down from a table. Impossible to tell who, in the dark. I saw their knees bend like they were Mario prepared to stomp on a Goomba.

A funny sound, cracking and wet at the same time. Imagine encrusting a water balloon in concrete, then popping the whole thing. Krak-sploosh!

Laughter like hyenas. More dancing bodies jumping down from the tables. Hands sweeping across shelves, seeking any straggling glass or metal. Music pounding, turning the classroom into a disco, the glass crunching in tune with the beat.

We couldn’t see a thing. That’s what they said after. That’s how they said it got out of control.

There’s a piece of that day that’s just fallen out of my head. Between the height of the laughter and the glass and the screams and the silence after, silence that seems sudden in my recollection, but I know that wasn’t the case. I know it must’ve died down bit by bit. But in my head it’s like a time skip. Like waking up from a dream.

Like all of us waking up at once.

The lights came on. Lisa Greene was standing at the doorway, her face covered in scratches. Mrs. Caruso, was standing behind her. The class looked like a hurricane had ran through it.

And at the eye of the storm?

Everyone stared wordlessly at the center of the room, seeing the red mess.

1jyc1i3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jyc1i3/the_substitute/,The Substitute,"Mr. Hadley wasn’t anyone’s favorite teacher.

He was mean as a snake. A harsh grader. He’d go off on tangents about topics that were *way* too hard for a sixth-grade class to understand, pause, glare at us like we were stinking up the room, and say, “well, those of you who’ll make it to college *might* learn more about that someday.” He smelled musty, like burnt coffee and old food, and he was more often than not wearing a putrid wool sweater that made me itch just looking at it. He was one of the older teachers at Moreland Middle School—at least he *looked* older, with dorky round glasses and six whole strands of hair—and seemed to deeply resent teaching a class of 12-year-olds with 12-year-old brains.

I was sitting next to Lisa Greene when the test thudded onto my desk. *C-.* I sighed in relief. Lisa glanced over, holding her chin high as she awaited her own test. I tried not to feel inferior as I flipped through the pages, cringing at all the questions that had been marked up in red ink.

Look, it’s not like I was a slacker. Mr. Hadley’s tests were *ridiculous*. He’d had to change them after a few parents complained about the “non-standard content”, and after that he *did* start to follow the standard curriculum, at least, but he still worded things like a sphinx, like he was hoping we’d pick the wrong letter and fall down some secret trapdoor. We’d all heard him grumbling about how “the world wasn’t built for geniuses” and he'd be damned if he was going to “help mediocrity prosper” like the rest of the teachers at Moreland.

The other teachers didn’t like him very much. Shocker, I know. Not even Mrs. Caruso, the English teacher, got along with him, and she didn’t have a mean bone in her body.

I wondered if Hadley had always hated the job so much. I couldn’t imagine a past version of him who didn’t enjoy tormenting children. As much as he already sucked, I swear that he was getting *worse.* Over the last few weeks, he’d been coming into class crankier than ever, and looking exhausted, too. He’d stopped bothering with combing back the six strands haloing his mirrorball head, and he actually wore the puke sweater for 11 days straight (I knew because I kept tallies in my science notebook).

He even yelled at Lisa when she asked a question about mitosis. A stunned silence fell over the class. For a moment, Hadley looked guilty, then his mouth twisted like he tasted something sour and he turned away from the crestfallen girl.

I don’t remember what I was doing on that Thursday evening. Playing video games, then homework, probably. It was probably an ordinary night for everyone except for Hadley. I still wonder what happened that night after he got into his car and drove home.

On Friday morning, he came in a changed man.

A changed man, *with* *candy*. The good stuff, too. Full-size chocolate bars. Instead of pulling up his usual lecture, he turned to us and said, “Good day to you all, my lovely students! Today’s no ordinary day, so why would we have an ordinary class? We’re going to watch a movie!”

I didn’t need to look around the class to sense the astonishment. Was this some kind of cruel trick?

You could hear a pin drop as he put on Osmosis Jones and handed out candy bars from a giant bag, humming cheerily all the time. I broke mine in half before eating to make sure there wasn’t anything nasty in there—nope. Just caramel and nougat.

I kept looking over at Hadley every few minutes from my safe position in the back right corner of the room. He was smiling gleefully behind his desk, his face lit up with an energy that had formerly only been applied to torturing his students. Every so often he’d lean over and scribble something down inside a beaten-up notebook.

That was Friday. The weekend passed with no science homework, for once. Then came Monday.

I was in my usual seat at the back corner of the room when Mr. Hadley walked in, but even from that distance I could tell something was very wrong.

He was taller. More upright, at least, like we were seeing him stand up straight for the first time ever. And had he put on *makeup*?  His skin looked smoother, and his dark circles were gone, so he looked ten years younger. He was wearing new clothes, too. A crisp collared shirt and gray pants, which I know doesn’t sound like the height of fashion or anything, but after the long reign of the puke sweater, he may as well have strolled out of a magazine cover. And he was *smiling.* A weird smile, all white and toothy. It looked painful to hold for too long. He strode to the front of the class, put his hands on his hips, and beamed: “Good morning, class!”

That was Hadley’s voice, but it was like… like somebody else was speaking through his body. Somebody who woke up with little blue birds chirping on his windowsill and mice buttoning up his shirt.

“Now that didn’t get much of a response! Where’s your enthusiasm for learning? GOOD MORNING, CLASS!”

It was quiet enough to hear the clack of Hadley’s teeth as he resumed his freaky smile.

“Today’s topic is energy, kids!” He moved to the whiteboard and wrote *ENERGY* in huge, perfectly neat letters. Even his handwriting was better than before.

“Now, last class we went over the different forms of energy. Who remembers the first law of thermodynamics?”

Lisa Greene’s voice broke the silence. “Um, the first law of thermodynamics is that energy can be neither created or destroyed,” she said quietly.

 Hadley threw his hands into the air, something that he’d only ever done before when ranting about our “bleak futures”. “Bingo, Ms. Greene! Energy can only be converted from one form to another. Now can we get a list going of some of those forms?”

Looking more confident, Lisa started to list off her on fingers. “First, there’s potential and kinetic,” she said. Hadley nodded and wrote down the two categories on the board.

“Kinetic energy—can we get some examples of kinetic energy?”

I raised my hand. “Thermal,” I said, wondering if I was having a weird dream.

Hadley nodded kindly. “Thermal! Yes, the energy of particles in motion. Keep them coming.”

“Um, mechanical,” I said. “And light, and sound, and um, sorry, I don’t remember any more.”

“That’s just fine,” Hadley said with a wave of his hand, and I actually pinched myself. He wrote down the other types on the whiteboard in his brand-new script. “Now, class, energy is a wonderful thing! Look at the lights in this room; feel the air-conditioning keeping you nice and cool. How is that we’ve harnessed the raw materials in the environment to work for our benefit? Well, we humans take the chemical energy in fossil fuels, transform it to kinetic energy as we burn it, and finally that becomes…”

Grace Hammond, who usually spent class trying to text from under her desk, raised her hand. “Electrical energy?”

“Exactly right, Ms. Hammond!”

It was easily the best class that Hadley had ever taught. I kept waiting for him to crack, for him to snap and tell us that none of us were going to graduate high school, but my waiting was in vain.

At lunch, the cafeteria went rabid with theories. Hadley had gotten a lobotomy. Hadley had won the lottery. Hadley had a secret good twin who had killed him and taken his place. Hadley had tripped and bumped his head and gone through a total personality change (Ryan Prescott said it had happened to an uncle of his and so he knew the signs).

Imaginations were running wild, but lots of the kids didn’t believe in the gossip until they saw it for themselves. Pretty soon, kids started filing past the teacher’s lounge to see for themselves. Meera Kapoor reported that apparently the other teachers looked just as astonished as the rest of us. Up until then, Hadley only ever ate his lunch alone in his classroom (the kids he had after lunch period always complained that the room smelled like weird old people food). No longer was that the case: Meera said that Hadley had been sitting at the table in the middle of the lounge, no Tupperware in sight, smiling and chatting up a storm with all the teachers. Meera said that Mrs. Caruso, had even been leaning in and tossing her hair and smiling a little *too* hard, though I’m not sure I believed that.

Round by round, everyone got a taste of new Hadley, and everyone was happy with new Hadley. He never scolded, never handed out detentions, never even asked anyone to put away their phone.

A week passed, and everyone stopped talking about it at lunch, because Chloe Thompson and Jason Wu got lice at the same time and everyone said she’d gotten it from him. But—it wasn’t normal. Nothing about new Hadley was normal. The way he talked, the way he smiled with both rows of teeth on display. The way his voice never strayed from that chipper tone. His tests were easier, and I was getting As in science for the first time, and I guess I really didn’t have anything to complain about—but *man*, it was *weird*.

It could’ve stayed at that level of uneventful weird, if not for Ryan.

It was 2:55 on a Friday when he blew The Spitball.

Of course it happened on a Friday, with everyone itching for the bell and fidgeting in their seats. Ryan, who liked to make trouble in every classroom he entered, had been chewing up bits of paper all throughout class.

Now Hadley’s back was turned while he was erasing the whiteboard, and Ryan aimed his straw at Hadley’s back.

*Phip.* The little white ball flew through the air and bounced off our teacher’s neck.

He didn’t notice.

Ryan sniggered, and his group of wannabee-Ryans elbowed each other and grinned.

He blew another spitball. Lisa stared hatefully at him.

*Phip.* The little ball hit the nape of Hadley’s neck and slid down the back of shirt. Another round of giggles from Ryan’s gang.

Our teacher turned around, smiling obliviously, and said, “Well, how about an early dismissal today, kids?”

Only, Ryan had loaded up *another spitball* and the momentum was already going, and I could see the horror spread over his face in the same beat that the spitball exited the end of the straw, and—

It hit Hadley square in the eye. Like, I think it actually bounced against his open eyeball. Hadley blinked slowly. Ryan made a sound like a frightened mouse. A round of gasps went up around the room.

Hadley struck his hands-on-hips pose and said, “Well, that’s all for today, kids!”

The bell rang, and he walked back to his desk.

I stared in disbelief. So did Ryan, and his gang, and Lisa Greene.

The stunned silence lasted only another second before Ryan made a mad grab for his backpack, leading to a shuffle of kids getting up, and we were making our way out into the hallway, then onto the buses.

“Did you see that—”

“Right in the middle of his face?”

“In his *eye!*”

“Like he didn’t even notice…”

Everyone was buzzing around Ryan, and there was a gleam in his eye that made me nervous. “I wasn’t even nervous,” I heard him boasting. “I knew he wasn’t gonna do nothing.”

“That was *so* disrespectful,” Lisa hissed, penetrating into the crowd of newly minted Ryan fans.

He crossed his arms and looked like he was considering sticking out his tongue at her before deciding he was too mature for that. “Was not. Hadley’s a crap teacher anyway.”

“He is *not*.”

“Okay, well, he *used* to be. Now he’s like… high or something all the time,” Ryan said to a round of chortles.

Grace Hammond piped up. “Ryan, did you really mean to hit him or was it an accident?”

“I meant to,” he said casually.

“No way,” Grace scoffed. “If that’s true, then do it again on Monday.”

A round of *oohs* went up. Ryan turned a little pink, then composed himself and shrugged. “Yeah, sure thing. I don’t care.”

Monday rolled around and the class was brimming with anticipation. Nobody was absorbing a word of Hadley’s lecture on the phases of matter (even though it was pretty interesting stuff, honestly, and I wanted to hear more about whatever plasma was). Ryan was sweating bullets next to me, twiddling a straw between his fingers. Two rows ahead of us, Grace kept turning around with a toss of her shiny hair and looking expectantly at Ryan. There were only ten minutes left in class. I saw him take a deep breath and bring the straw to his lips.

“So, heat is the same thing as kinetic energy…”

*Plip!* Nobody could miss the spitball bounce between his eyes.

“…and that is why boiling water causes it to change into the vapor phase. Isn’t that just incredible?”

There had been absolutely no realization in his eyes. None.

One of the rowdier guys in class, Jason Wu, balled up a piece of paper and threw it at Hadley’s back. It hit him and landed on the ground.

No response. Jason couldn’t muffle his giggle. Grace was grinning behind her hands, her eyes wide and gleaming.

The weeks rolled by, and we grew bolder. Hadley would get in maybe ten minutes of actual teaching before the class descended into chatter and horseplay. The annoying thing is that Hadley had finally gotten the hang of teaching in a way that didn’t make me want to flee the country. It was by-the-book, pretty robotic, actually, but that was heaven compared to the lectures he’d been giving before. It was too bad I could hardly absorb the lessons over my rowdy classmates.

About a month into Hadley’s transformation, the class had lost all residual fear of him, like domesticated animals forgetting to be scared around their natural predators. One Monday, Grace took out her phone and started casually scrolling it next to the science workbook we were supposed to be filling out. Hadley furrowed his brow. “No phones during class, Grace,” he said lamely. Everyone froze. Old Hadley would’ve gotten out the bear-safe food locker and made Grace do a walk of shame up to the desk.

New Hadley turned around and finished drawing the structure of sodium chloride with perfect, straight black lines.

Grace exchanged glances and giggles with her best friend, Mona, and kept on scrolling. Ten minutes later, Hadley turned around and squinted in her direction, said “no phones during class,” and continued to talk about ionic bonds.

On Tuesday, we were learning about the differences between plant and animal cells by looking at onion slices under a microscope. I remember the day well because Grace Hammond was my lab partner and it felt like I was half outside my body, watching as I made a big dumb fool of myself. Half of the kids weren’t doing their experiments at all. Ryan was flicking onion bits at his buddies, and they’d made a game of trying to catch it in their mouths. Hadley was walking placidly around the classroom, stopping every now and then to check on a microscope and nod or make a minor adjustment. Even though he creeped me out a little, I *liked* new Hadley—he was helpful. I didn’t get why everyone made such a joke of pushing him around.

As he was walking down the last row, I saw Jason elbow Ryan and snigger something into his ear. I was looking down the barrel of my microscope—was that anaphase?—when I heard a loud thud. I looked up.

Hadley was lying face-first on the floor. Ryan, Jason, and their friends were standing around him with bug eyes and suppressed laughter. Ryan hadn’t even bothered to move his foot from where it was planted in the middle of the row.

Lisa was turning red as she took in the scene. I was on her side, but when I opened my mouth to say something to Ryan, my voice shrank and died in my throat. “You are *bullying* him,” she hissed, and I saw that she was trying not to cry.

“Oh no! Are you okay, *Mister Hadley?*” Ryan said with mock concern. Lots of nervous giggles were going up around the room.

We all watched as Hadley got up from the floor. He did it so smooth and steady you’d never have guessed he’d just been tripped by surprise, pushing himself up on his hands first and then rising to his feet. He brushed off his pants. I could have sworn his forehead looked dented. “Well, excuse me, class,” he said stiffly. “I must have lost my balance.”

And with that, he returned to his desk and spent the rest of the class grading papers. Ryan hi-fived his friends in plain view of everyone.

I went home from school that day feeling shaken. Ryan had always been a jerk, but for the first time, I felt a real stir of hatred for him. My mom noticed that I was upset, but I brushed it off—no matter what happened, I wasn’t going to be the kid who called in the parents to shut things down. On the bright side, she decided to take me out for ice cream, our family’s failsafe method for cheering someone up.

I was walking out of the Baskin Robbins with a loaded rocky-road cone when I saw him. Mr. Hadley. He had just come out of the hardware store carrying two heavy-looking bags, and he was making a beeline for his car. I stopped in my tracks and stared. Was *this* what he did after school? I’d seen in him the wild while out with my family a few times when he was still a miserable old crank, but this was the first time since the personality replacement. He looked… different. How had he been hiding that beer belly in class? And where was the perfect posture? Not only that, but his whole face looked grumpier, his eyes sharper, more *alive*, and I wondered if he taped his face skin back during the school hours or something. Adults did some pretty crazy things when they hit their midlife crises, didn’t they? As ridiculous as that seemed, I couldn’t think of any other explanation for the difference.

The next week, the bright, smiley Hadley was back in class, but the kids were different. It wasn’t just Ryan anymore. Everyone had been emboldened by last week’s incident. Kids talked right over him, and his meek reprimands had zero effect. It got worse every day, and I was at a loss for why Hadley was allowing it to happen. On Tuesday, he got tripped *again*, this time by scrawny Stewart Fogel, who until then I’d always thought was as incapable of misbehaving as Lisa. He got up without a word. On Wednesday, Jason Wu came in early to put a thumbtack on his chair, and the whole class watched with baited breath as he sat down on it and… nothing. He didn’t even exhale. We all saw the thumbtack poking out of his pants when he turned around, too. That started the rumor that Hadley wore ten layers of underwear. On Thursday, Grace brought a roll of toilet paper from the girl’s bathroom and wrapped it around his leg while Mona distracted him with questions about the homework. He walked around the rest of the class with the paper trailing behind him, refusing to acknowledge it.

The next week, it was clear that Hadley was off his game. There was one class period where Lisa raised her hand three times before he noticed her. At one point he stood in front of the whiteboard with an uncapped marker for what felt like five minutes before shaking his head and sitting back down, the board blank as snow. I felt bad. If he really had bumped his head and lost his ability to stand up to his students, how far were we going to push it?

On Thursday, we got to class and there was no Hadley present. No substitute, either.

“It’s been fifteen minutes, that means we can leave,” Jason Wu chirped up after three minutes had elapsed.

“No, it doesn’t,” Lisa said.

“Lisa’s going to tell the principal,” moaned Mona.

Grace chimed in.  “Lisa, you’re not gonna do that, are you? You’re not gonna ruin it for everyone?”

“No, I guess I’m not,” Lisa said, thin-lipped.

I guess none of the other teachers bothered to look into the room as they walked by, because we passed the period drawing on the whiteboards and dicking around.

The next day, we arrived again to an empty classroom. It was a Friday, and there was an energy of mischief crackling in the air. It was in the way Ryan and his wannabees strutted into the room, shoving each other around as they filed in, and how Grace’s clique giggled and whispered to each other in the circle of chairs they’d arranged at the back of class. Lisa was sitting stiffly at her desk, trying not to make eye contact with anyone.

“Bet he died and the school just hasn’t noticed yet,” Ryan said. “You know what that means, right, guys?”

“It means we can do whatever we want,” Jason said, jumping up on a table.

“You guys,” Lisa said in a small voice. “We should just wait a few minutes.”

“Or we get to have fun,” Ryan said, rolling his eyes. “Turn down the lights!” One of the guys ran to the light switches and dimmed them so the familiar room fell into shadows. It looked bigger when it was dark. A few yelps went up from the crowd before dissolving into giggles and shouts. People got out of their desks and went to go chat with their friends. Furniture was shuffled and rearranged.

Somebody started playing music—loud, thumping music that spiked my nerves like someone drumming on my spine.

There was a new sound, too, one of jangling glass. I looked up. Jason had somehow found the key to the equipment cabinets and was rifling through the glass beakers and tubes. In the dark, I couldn’t see if he did it on purpose or not, but we all heard the crash of a rack of test tubes splintering on the ground.

Somebody screeched in the dark. Jason laughed, and it was like a contagion: everyone else laughed too. I even found myself laughing.

“Guys, *stop* it, or I’m going to call a teacher,” Lisa said, louder this time.

*Thwock*. Something bounced off of Lisa’s forehead and thumped onto the ground. She looked down. So did everyone else. A pink eraser.

This time, the laughter ripped shamelessly through the room, drowning out any protestations. I felt myself laughing too. It was so loud that nobody noticed the door clicking open. Nobody noticed the adult marching his way to the front of the room. Nobody noticed until—

“*WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?”*

Was this really the same calm, smiling Hadley from only three days ago? He was standing purple-faced with his eyes bulging, his head poking out of that putrid green sweater like a turtle sticking out of its shell. His bellow *should* have been terrifying. A month and a half ago, that would’ve had everyone freezing on the spot and awaiting their doom.

Now, it only made everyone laugh harder. It was just *Hadley.* Not like he was going to do anything.

“Hey guys, let’s give him a big welcome!” Ryan shouted.

I don’t know who threw the first projectile. Maybe Jason, maybe one of the nerdy kids. It could’ve been anyone. *Whack!* The pencil struck Hadley in the forehead, point first, leaving a dot of graphite above his eyebrows. For a moment, he stood stock-still, his eyes bulging out of his head.

A fresh wave of shouts and chortles. I couldn’t help it—I felt it bubbling out of my mouth again. The image of Hadley standing there with the pencil mark on his face, his mouth hanging open—it was *funny*. He was shouting something now, but nobody could hear it above our laughter. More kids were climbing up on the tables. I saw a girl rifling through her backpack, her face obscured by the dark. In fact, it was hard to see who anyone was other than Hadley.

A small object whizzed through the air and smacked Hadley on the side of the head. Maybe another pencil. If you thought he couldn’t get any angrier, *boy*. Then another, and another, and other. It was hard to tell what was being thrown: Erasers? Balled-up paper? Packs of gum? Anything we had at hand was getting chucked. I saw Lisa trying to get to the door, but everyone was jostling her, making it hard for her move more than a few feet.

I was getting left out; I needed to act before I got hit, too. My arm reached for a pencil sharpener and pitched it across the room. I don’t know if it hit him. I couldn’t see much of what was happening anymore; I was one of the few kids who wasn’t standing on the tables.

Still, I was part of the festivities. It was *fun.*

The projectiles were getting bigger. Notebooks. Pencil cases. Shoes.

You could barely hear the shouts of indignation through the laughter. You could barely hear them turn to shouts of pain.

Then, the sound of shattered glass; a pretty, twinkling sound.

Somebody perched on a chair was handing beakers and test tubes to the waiting hands below. Somebody handing out scissors.

*Crash! Crash! Crash!* Explosions of glass, everywhere.

Screams not like a grown man would make, but high-pitched, cartoonish. Funny screams. Fake screams.

Laughter.

A textbook arcing through the air, coming down with the kind of thud you hear in cartoons.

More laughter, mad laughter.

Someone jumped down from a table. Impossible to tell who, in the dark. I saw their knees bend like they were Mario prepared to stomp on a Goomba.

A funny sound, cracking and wet at the same time. Imagine encrusting a water balloon in concrete, then popping the whole thing. Krak-sploosh!

Laughter like hyenas. More dancing bodies jumping down from the tables. Hands sweeping across shelves, seeking any straggling glass or metal. Music pounding, turning the classroom into a disco, the glass crunching in tune with the beat.

We couldn’t see a thing. That’s what they said after. That’s how they said it got out of control.

There’s a piece of that day that’s just fallen out of my head. Between the height of the laughter and the glass and the screams and the silence after, silence that seems sudden in my recollection, but I know that wasn’t the case. I know it must’ve died down bit by bit. But in my head it’s like a time skip. Like waking up from a dream.

Like all of us waking up at once.

The lights came on. Lisa Greene was standing at the doorway, her face covered in scratches. Mrs. Caruso, was standing behind her. The class looked like a hurricane had ran through it.

And at the eye of the storm?

Everyone stared wordlessly at the center of the room, seeing the red mess.

We are still on BabyStep 1. It’s been about a month since we started our journey. We have cut out all subscriptions, we meal prep, and no more extra spending. We have $800 in our baby emergency fund. 

Except for this weekend.

I’m a stress spender. And a teacher. Which is a terrible combination, because there’s always stress to be had.

I got a drink from a gas station, coffee/breakfast from Sbux, and my husband and I went out to eat Thursday.

I’m feeling myself slipping into my old ways, and I’m freaking out!!

1jybvxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/campfirecreeps/comments/1jybvxw/the_substitute/,The Substitute,"Mr. Hadley wasn’t anyone’s favorite teacher.

He was mean as a snake. A harsh grader. He’d go off on tangents about topics that were *way* too hard for a sixth-grade class to understand, pause, glare at us like we were stinking up the room, and say, “well, those of you who’ll make it to college *might* learn more about that someday.” He smelled musty, like burnt coffee and old food, and he was more often than not wearing a putrid wool sweater that made me itch just looking at it. He was one of the older teachers at Moreland Middle School—at least he *looked* older, with dorky round glasses and six whole strands of hair—and seemed to deeply resent teaching a class of 12-year-olds with 12-year-old brains.

I was sitting next to Lisa Greene when the test thudded onto my desk. *C-.* I sighed in relief. Lisa glanced over, holding her chin high as she awaited her own test. I tried not to feel inferior as I flipped through the pages, cringing at all the questions that had been marked up in red ink.

Look, it’s not like I was a slacker. Mr. Hadley’s tests were *ridiculous*. He’d had to change them after a few parents complained about the “non-standard content”, and after that he *did* start to follow the standard curriculum, at least, but he still worded things like a sphinx, like he was hoping we’d pick the wrong letter and fall down some secret trapdoor. We’d all heard him grumbling about how “the world wasn’t built for geniuses” and he'd be damned if he was going to “help mediocrity prosper” like the rest of the teachers at Moreland.

The other teachers didn’t like him very much. Shocker, I know. Not even Mrs. Caruso, the English teacher, got along with him, and she didn’t have a mean bone in her body.

I wondered if Hadley had always hated the job so much. I couldn’t imagine a past version of him who didn’t enjoy tormenting children. As much as he already sucked, I swear that he was getting *worse.* Over the last few weeks, he’d been coming into class crankier than ever, and looking exhausted, too. He’d stopped bothering with combing back the six strands haloing his mirrorball head, and he actually wore the puke sweater for 11 days straight (I knew because I kept tallies in my science notebook).

He even yelled at Lisa when she asked a question about mitosis. A stunned silence fell over the class. For a moment, Hadley looked guilty, then his mouth twisted like he tasted something sour and he turned away from the crestfallen girl.

I don’t remember what I was doing on that Thursday evening. Playing video games, then homework, probably. It was probably an ordinary night for everyone except for Hadley. I still wonder what happened that night after he got into his car and drove home.

On Friday morning, he came in a changed man.

A changed man, *with* *candy*. The good stuff, too. Full-size chocolate bars. Instead of pulling up his usual lecture, he turned to us and said, “Good day to you all, my lovely students! Today’s no ordinary day, so why would we have an ordinary class? We’re going to watch a movie!”

I didn’t need to look around the class to sense the astonishment. Was this some kind of cruel trick?

You could hear a pin drop as he put on Osmosis Jones and handed out candy bars from a giant bag, humming cheerily all the time. I broke mine in half before eating to make sure there wasn’t anything nasty in there—nope. Just caramel and nougat.

I kept looking over at Hadley every few minutes from my safe position in the back right corner of the room. He was smiling gleefully behind his desk, his face lit up with an energy that had formerly only been applied to torturing his students. Every so often he’d lean over and scribble something down inside a beaten-up notebook.

That was Friday. The weekend passed with no science homework, for once. Then came Monday.

I was in my usual seat at the back corner of the room when Mr. Hadley walked in, but even from that distance I could tell something was very wrong.

He was taller. More upright, at least, like we were seeing him stand up straight for the first time ever. And had he put on *makeup*?  His skin looked smoother, and his dark circles were gone, so he looked ten years younger. He was wearing new clothes, too. A crisp collared shirt and gray pants, which I know doesn’t sound like the height of fashion or anything, but after the long reign of the puke sweater, he may as well have strolled out of a magazine cover. And he was *smiling.* A weird smile, all white and toothy. It looked painful to hold for too long. He strode to the front of the class, put his hands on his hips, and beamed: “Good morning, class!”

That was Hadley’s voice, but it was like… like somebody else was speaking through his body. Somebody who woke up with little blue birds chirping on his windowsill and mice buttoning up his shirt.

“Now that didn’t get much of a response! Where’s your enthusiasm for learning? GOOD MORNING, CLASS!”

It was quiet enough to hear the clack of Hadley’s teeth as he resumed his freaky smile.

“Today’s topic is energy, kids!” He moved to the whiteboard and wrote *ENERGY* in huge, perfectly neat letters. Even his handwriting was better than before.

“Now, last class we went over the different forms of energy. Who remembers the first law of thermodynamics?”

Lisa Greene’s voice broke the silence. “Um, the first law of thermodynamics is that energy can be neither created or destroyed,” she said quietly.

 Hadley threw his hands into the air, something that he’d only ever done before when ranting about our “bleak futures”. “Bingo, Ms. Greene! Energy can only be converted from one form to another. Now can we get a list going of some of those forms?”

Looking more confident, Lisa started to list off her on fingers. “First, there’s potential and kinetic,” she said. Hadley nodded and wrote down the two categories on the board.

“Kinetic energy—can we get some examples of kinetic energy?”

I raised my hand. “Thermal,” I said, wondering if I was having a weird dream.

Hadley nodded kindly. “Thermal! Yes, the energy of particles in motion. Keep them coming.”

“Um, mechanical,” I said. “And light, and sound, and um, sorry, I don’t remember any more.”

“That’s just fine,” Hadley said with a wave of his hand, and I actually pinched myself. He wrote down the other types on the whiteboard in his brand-new script. “Now, class, energy is a wonderful thing! Look at the lights in this room; feel the air-conditioning keeping you nice and cool. How is that we’ve harnessed the raw materials in the environment to work for our benefit? Well, we humans take the chemical energy in fossil fuels, transform it to kinetic energy as we burn it, and finally that becomes…”

Grace Hammond, who usually spent class trying to text from under her desk, raised her hand. “Electrical energy?”

“Exactly right, Ms. Hammond!”

It was easily the best class that Hadley had ever taught. I kept waiting for him to crack, for him to snap and tell us that none of us were going to graduate high school, but my waiting was in vain.

At lunch, the cafeteria went rabid with theories. Hadley had gotten a lobotomy. Hadley had won the lottery. Hadley had a secret good twin who had killed him and taken his place. Hadley had tripped and bumped his head and gone through a total personality change (Ryan Prescott said it had happened to an uncle of his and so he knew the signs).

Imaginations were running wild, but lots of the kids didn’t believe in the gossip until they saw it for themselves. Pretty soon, kids started filing past the teacher’s lounge to see for themselves. Meera Kapoor reported that apparently the other teachers looked just as astonished as the rest of us. Up until then, Hadley only ever ate his lunch alone in his classroom (the kids he had after lunch period always complained that the room smelled like weird old people food). No longer was that the case: Meera said that Hadley had been sitting at the table in the middle of the lounge, no Tupperware in sight, smiling and chatting up a storm with all the teachers. Meera said that Mrs. Caruso, had even been leaning in and tossing her hair and smiling a little *too* hard, though I’m not sure I believed that.

Round by round, everyone got a taste of new Hadley, and everyone was happy with new Hadley. He never scolded, never handed out detentions, never even asked anyone to put away their phone.

A week passed, and everyone stopped talking about it at lunch, because Chloe Thompson and Jason Wu got lice at the same time and everyone said she’d gotten it from him. But—it wasn’t normal. Nothing about new Hadley was normal. The way he talked, the way he smiled with both rows of teeth on display. The way his voice never strayed from that chipper tone. His tests were easier, and I was getting As in science for the first time, and I guess I really didn’t have anything to complain about—but *man*, it was *weird*.

It could’ve stayed at that level of uneventful weird, if not for Ryan.

It was 2:55 on a Friday when he blew The Spitball.

Of course it happened on a Friday, with everyone itching for the bell and fidgeting in their seats. Ryan, who liked to make trouble in every classroom he entered, had been chewing up bits of paper all throughout class.

Now Hadley’s back was turned while he was erasing the whiteboard, and Ryan aimed his straw at Hadley’s back.

*Phip.* The little white ball flew through the air and bounced off our teacher’s neck.

He didn’t notice.

Ryan sniggered, and his group of wannabee-Ryans elbowed each other and grinned.

He blew another spitball. Lisa stared hatefully at him.

*Phip.* The little ball hit the nape of Hadley’s neck and slid down the back of shirt. Another round of giggles from Ryan’s gang.

Our teacher turned around, smiling obliviously, and said, “Well, how about an early dismissal today, kids?”

Only, Ryan had loaded up *another spitball* and the momentum was already going, and I could see the horror spread over his face in the same beat that the spitball exited the end of the straw, and—

It hit Hadley square in the eye. Like, I think it actually bounced against his open eyeball. Hadley blinked slowly. Ryan made a sound like a frightened mouse. A round of gasps went up around the room.

Hadley struck his hands-on-hips pose and said, “Well, that’s all for today, kids!”

The bell rang, and he walked back to his desk.

I stared in disbelief. So did Ryan, and his gang, and Lisa Greene.

The stunned silence lasted only another second before Ryan made a mad grab for his backpack, leading to a shuffle of kids getting up, and we were making our way out into the hallway, then onto the buses.

“Did you see that—”

“Right in the middle of his face?”

“In his *eye!*”

“Like he didn’t even notice…”

Everyone was buzzing around Ryan, and there was a gleam in his eye that made me nervous. “I wasn’t even nervous,” I heard him boasting. “I knew he wasn’t gonna do nothing.”

“That was *so* disrespectful,” Lisa hissed, penetrating into the crowd of newly minted Ryan fans.

He crossed his arms and looked like he was considering sticking out his tongue at her before deciding he was too mature for that. “Was not. Hadley’s a crap teacher anyway.”

“He is *not*.”

“Okay, well, he *used* to be. Now he’s like… high or something all the time,” Ryan said to a round of chortles.

Grace Hammond piped up. “Ryan, did you really mean to hit him or was it an accident?”

“I meant to,” he said casually.

“No way,” Grace scoffed. “If that’s true, then do it again on Monday.”

A round of *oohs* went up. Ryan turned a little pink, then composed himself and shrugged. “Yeah, sure thing. I don’t care.”

Monday rolled around and the class was brimming with anticipation. Nobody was absorbing a word of Hadley’s lecture on the phases of matter (even though it was pretty interesting stuff, honestly, and I wanted to hear more about whatever plasma was). Ryan was sweating bullets next to me, twiddling a straw between his fingers. Two rows ahead of us, Grace kept turning around with a toss of her shiny hair and looking expectantly at Ryan. There were only ten minutes left in class. I saw him take a deep breath and bring the straw to his lips.

“So, heat is the same thing as kinetic energy…”

*Plip!* Nobody could miss the spitball bounce between his eyes.

“…and that is why boiling water causes it to change into the vapor phase. Isn’t that just incredible?”

There had been absolutely no realization in his eyes. None.

One of the rowdier guys in class, Jason Wu, balled up a piece of paper and threw it at Hadley’s back. It hit him and landed on the ground.

No response. Jason couldn’t muffle his giggle. Grace was grinning behind her hands, her eyes wide and gleaming.

The weeks rolled by, and we grew bolder. Hadley would get in maybe ten minutes of actual teaching before the class descended into chatter and horseplay. The annoying thing is that Hadley had finally gotten the hang of teaching in a way that didn’t make me want to flee the country. It was by-the-book, pretty robotic, actually, but that was heaven compared to the lectures he’d been giving before. It was too bad I could hardly absorb the lessons over my rowdy classmates.

About a month into Hadley’s transformation, the class had lost all residual fear of him, like domesticated animals forgetting to be scared around their natural predators. One Monday, Grace took out her phone and started casually scrolling it next to the science workbook we were supposed to be filling out. Hadley furrowed his brow. “No phones during class, Grace,” he said lamely. Everyone froze. Old Hadley would’ve gotten out the bear-safe food locker and made Grace do a walk of shame up to the desk.

New Hadley turned around and finished drawing the structure of sodium chloride with perfect, straight black lines.

Grace exchanged glances and giggles with her best friend, Mona, and kept on scrolling. Ten minutes later, Hadley turned around and squinted in her direction, said “no phones during class,” and continued to talk about ionic bonds.

On Tuesday, we were learning about the differences between plant and animal cells by looking at onion slices under a microscope. I remember the day well because Grace Hammond was my lab partner and it felt like I was half outside my body, watching as I made a big dumb fool of myself. Half of the kids weren’t doing their experiments at all. Ryan was flicking onion bits at his buddies, and they’d made a game of trying to catch it in their mouths. Hadley was walking placidly around the classroom, stopping every now and then to check on a microscope and nod or make a minor adjustment. Even though he creeped me out a little, I *liked* new Hadley—he was helpful. I didn’t get why everyone made such a joke of pushing him around.

As he was walking down the last row, I saw Jason elbow Ryan and snigger something into his ear. I was looking down the barrel of my microscope—was that anaphase?—when I heard a loud thud. I looked up.

Hadley was lying face-first on the floor. Ryan, Jason, and their friends were standing around him with bug eyes and suppressed laughter. Ryan hadn’t even bothered to move his foot from where it was planted in the middle of the row.

Lisa was turning red as she took in the scene. I was on her side, but when I opened my mouth to say something to Ryan, my voice shrank and died in my throat. “You are *bullying* him,” she hissed, and I saw that she was trying not to cry.

“Oh no! Are you okay, *Mister Hadley?*” Ryan said with mock concern. Lots of nervous giggles were going up around the room.

We all watched as Hadley got up from the floor. He did it so smooth and steady you’d never have guessed he’d just been tripped by surprise, pushing himself up on his hands first and then rising to his feet. He brushed off his pants. I could have sworn his forehead looked dented. “Well, excuse me, class,” he said stiffly. “I must have lost my balance.”

And with that, he returned to his desk and spent the rest of the class grading papers. Ryan hi-fived his friends in plain view of everyone.

I went home from school that day feeling shaken. Ryan had always been a jerk, but for the first time, I felt a real stir of hatred for him. My mom noticed that I was upset, but I brushed it off—no matter what happened, I wasn’t going to be the kid who called in the parents to shut things down. On the bright side, she decided to take me out for ice cream, our family’s failsafe method for cheering someone up.

I was walking out of the Baskin Robbins with a loaded rocky-road cone when I saw him. Mr. Hadley. He had just come out of the hardware store carrying two heavy-looking bags, and he was making a beeline for his car. I stopped in my tracks and stared. Was *this* what he did after school? I’d seen in him the wild while out with my family a few times when he was still a miserable old crank, but this was the first time since the personality replacement. He looked… different. How had he been hiding that beer belly in class? And where was the perfect posture? Not only that, but his whole face looked grumpier, his eyes sharper, more *alive*, and I wondered if he taped his face skin back during the school hours or something. Adults did some pretty crazy things when they hit their midlife crises, didn’t they? As ridiculous as that seemed, I couldn’t think of any other explanation for the difference.

The next week, the bright, smiley Hadley was back in class, but the kids were different. It wasn’t just Ryan anymore. Everyone had been emboldened by last week’s incident. Kids talked right over him, and his meek reprimands had zero effect. It got worse every day, and I was at a loss for why Hadley was allowing it to happen. On Tuesday, he got tripped *again*, this time by scrawny Stewart Fogel, who until then I’d always thought was as incapable of misbehaving as Lisa. He got up without a word. On Wednesday, Jason Wu came in early to put a thumbtack on his chair, and the whole class watched with baited breath as he sat down on it and… nothing. He didn’t even exhale. We all saw the thumbtack poking out of his pants when he turned around, too. That started the rumor that Hadley wore ten layers of underwear. On Thursday, Grace brought a roll of toilet paper from the girl’s bathroom and wrapped it around his leg while Mona distracted him with questions about the homework. He walked around the rest of the class with the paper trailing behind him, refusing to acknowledge it.

The next week, it was clear that Hadley was off his game. There was one class period where Lisa raised her hand three times before he noticed her. At one point he stood in front of the whiteboard with an uncapped marker for what felt like five minutes before shaking his head and sitting back down, the board blank as snow. I felt bad. If he really had bumped his head and lost his ability to stand up to his students, how far were we going to push it?

On Thursday, we got to class and there was no Hadley present. No substitute, either.

“It’s been fifteen minutes, that means we can leave,” Jason Wu chirped up after three minutes had elapsed.

“No, it doesn’t,” Lisa said.

“Lisa’s going to tell the principal,” moaned Mona.

Grace chimed in.  “Lisa, you’re not gonna do that, are you? You’re not gonna ruin it for everyone?”

“No, I guess I’m not,” Lisa said, thin-lipped.

I guess none of the other teachers bothered to look into the room as they walked by, because we passed the period drawing on the whiteboards and dicking around.

The next day, we arrived again to an empty classroom. It was a Friday, and there was an energy of mischief crackling in the air. It was in the way Ryan and his wannabees strutted into the room, shoving each other around as they filed in, and how Grace’s clique giggled and whispered to each other in the circle of chairs they’d arranged at the back of class. Lisa was sitting stiffly at her desk, trying not to make eye contact with anyone.

“Bet he died and the school just hasn’t noticed yet,” Ryan said. “You know what that means, right, guys?”

“It means we can do whatever we want,” Jason said, jumping up on a table.

“You guys,” Lisa said in a small voice. “We should just wait a few minutes.”

“Or we get to have fun,” Ryan said, rolling his eyes. “Turn down the lights!” One of the guys ran to the light switches and dimmed them so the familiar room fell into shadows. It looked bigger when it was dark. A few yelps went up from the crowd before dissolving into giggles and shouts. People got out of their desks and went to go chat with their friends. Furniture was shuffled and rearranged.

Somebody started playing music—loud, thumping music that spiked my nerves like someone drumming on my spine.

There was a new sound, too, one of jangling glass. I looked up. Jason had somehow found the key to the equipment cabinets and was rifling through the glass beakers and tubes. In the dark, I couldn’t see if he did it on purpose or not, but we all heard the crash of a rack of test tubes splintering on the ground.

Somebody screeched in the dark. Jason laughed, and it was like a contagion: everyone else laughed too. I even found myself laughing.

“Guys, *stop* it, or I’m going to call a teacher,” Lisa said, louder this time.

*Thwock*. Something bounced off of Lisa’s forehead and thumped onto the ground. She looked down. So did everyone else. A pink eraser.

This time, the laughter ripped shamelessly through the room, drowning out any protestations. I felt myself laughing too. It was so loud that nobody noticed the door clicking open. Nobody noticed the adult marching his way to the front of the room. Nobody noticed until—

“*WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?”*

Was this really the same calm, smiling Hadley from only three days ago? He was standing purple-faced with his eyes bulging, his head poking out of that putrid green sweater like a turtle sticking out of its shell. His bellow *should* have been terrifying. A month and a half ago, that would’ve had everyone freezing on the spot and awaiting their doom.

Now, it only made everyone laugh harder. It was just *Hadley.* Not like he was going to do anything.

“Hey guys, let’s give him a big welcome!” Ryan shouted.

I don’t know who threw the first projectile. Maybe Jason, maybe one of the nerdy kids. It could’ve been anyone. *Whack!* The pencil struck Hadley in the forehead, point first, leaving a dot of graphite above his eyebrows. For a moment, he stood stock-still, his eyes bulging out of his head.

A fresh wave of shouts and chortles. I couldn’t help it—I felt it bubbling out of my mouth again. The image of Hadley standing there with the pencil mark on his face, his mouth hanging open—it was *funny*. He was shouting something now, but nobody could hear it above our laughter. More kids were climbing up on the tables. I saw a girl rifling through her backpack, her face obscured by the dark. In fact, it was hard to see who anyone was other than Hadley.

A small object whizzed through the air and smacked Hadley on the side of the head. Maybe another pencil. If you thought he couldn’t get any angrier, *boy*. Then another, and another, and other. It was hard to tell what was being thrown: Erasers? Balled-up paper? Packs of gum? Anything we had at hand was getting chucked. I saw Lisa trying to get to the door, but everyone was jostling her, making it hard for her move more than a few feet.

I was getting left out; I needed to act before I got hit, too. My arm reached for a pencil sharpener and pitched it across the room. I don’t know if it hit him. I couldn’t see much of what was happening anymore; I was one of the few kids who wasn’t standing on the tables.

Still, I was part of the festivities. It was *fun.*

The projectiles were getting bigger. Notebooks. Pencil cases. Shoes.

You could barely hear the shouts of indignation through the laughter. You could barely hear them turn to shouts of pain.

Then, the sound of shattered glass; a pretty, twinkling sound.

Somebody perched on a chair was handing beakers and test tubes to the waiting hands below. Somebody handing out scissors.

*Crash! Crash! Crash!* Explosions of glass, everywhere.

Screams not like a grown man would make, but high-pitched, cartoonish. Funny screams. Fake screams.

Laughter.

A textbook arcing through the air, coming down with the kind of thud you hear in cartoons.

More laughter, mad laughter.

Someone jumped down from a table. Impossible to tell who, in the dark. I saw their knees bend like they were Mario prepared to stomp on a Goomba.

A funny sound, cracking and wet at the same time. Imagine encrusting a water balloon in concrete, then popping the whole thing. Krak-sploosh!

Laughter like hyenas. More dancing bodies jumping down from the tables. Hands sweeping across shelves, seeking any straggling glass or metal. Music pounding, turning the classroom into a disco, the glass crunching in tune with the beat.

We couldn’t see a thing. That’s what they said after. That’s how they said it got out of control.

There’s a piece of that day that’s just fallen out of my head. Between the height of the laughter and the glass and the screams and the silence after, silence that seems sudden in my recollection, but I know that wasn’t the case. I know it must’ve died down bit by bit. But in my head it’s like a time skip. Like waking up from a dream.

Like all of us waking up at once.

The lights came on. Lisa Greene was standing at the doorway, her face covered in scratches. Mrs. Caruso, was standing behind her. The class looked like a hurricane had ran through it.

And at the eye of the storm?

Everyone stared wordlessly at the center of the room, seeing the red mess.

Poor Mrs. Caruso began to scream.",1,1744562455.0,campfirecreeps,0,1.0,False

Maybe it's because I cannot keep it pent up anymore. Maybe I'd like someone other than myself to hear it so that I'll not feel totally crazy.  
It happened four years ago, during a family holiday. We went to this remote coffee plantation, tucked deep inside the mountains. It had that ""rustic charm"" thing happening, but honestly, everything about it was wrong. Like the place had been stuck in time. Like it was waiting for something. but I don't know what.  
They were the ones who accompanied us on this tour. This guy talking about the history of coffee, all these facts and statistics that nobody cared about. The whole crew was listening to his every word, but I wasn't. I wasn't listening. I didn't care.  
So my twin and me—starved bored—split off. We just wanted to waste some time. The house had all these old black-and-white photographs hung up around the walls. Like, ""look how vintage we are."" No one else was paying attention because they were all distracted by the tour, so we went over to check them out. And then we found this hallway. Not even well marked. Sort of a barely readable ""No Entry"" sign, actually. No lock. No guards. Just an old grimy hallway with no one there. We looked at each other for a moment, and without needing to say anything, we went inside.  
There, at the far end of the hall, was this photo. Behind glass in a worn frame, growing old. The sort of photo observed by decades' worth of dust settle on. It hung at an angle, as if no one had bothered to straighten it in years. It was a queue of people—outside the estate, all lined up. But it wasn't a posed photograph. It wasn't a forced family photo or anything like it. They were simply standing there, staring. Not at the lens, not grinning. simply staring. Vacant. Quiet.  
And when I saw it, my stomach dropped. Because I knew that image.I'd seen it somewhere before.,in my dream the night before. I know it makes no sense, but I swear—I was in the dream. I wasn't looking at it; I was present. I remember being behind the camera, feeling its weight in my hands. The clicking of the shutter. The way the light hit them on their faces, the way the photo looked as it came out. It was real. Like, real-real. Like it wasn't even a dream. It was a memory.  
I said nothing to my sister. I just glanced at the photograph. For a second, it was as if the faces in the photograph were staring at me. As if they could see me. As if they waited for me. We left the hallway in silence. We blended in with the group as if everything was normal, but I couldn't help feel that something had.

1jybtwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimsOfAlgeria/comments/1jybtwd/i_asked_ai_how_to_turn_algerian/,I ASKED AI HOW TO TURN ALGERIAN,"Heres the ai answer:

# 🇩🇿 How to Turn Algerian: A Survival Guide 🇩🇿

**(For Beginners, Cousins, and Curious Souls)**

# 1. Master the Algerian Nod™

* That subtle upward nod followed by a quick ""Labas?"" is your passport to any social interaction.
* Bonus points if you throw in a *hand slap + cheek kiss combo* with the homies.

# 2. Speak Like a Dzairi

* **Arabic? Kind of. French? A little. Amazigh? Sometimes.** All mixed up? Now you're getting it.
* Learn key words:
   * *Saha* = Cheers / Health / Thanks / Respect
   * *Khouya / Khouti* = My brother / bros
   * *Zkara* = Pure pettiness, done for the soul
   * *3lash?* = Why?
   * *Machi normal* = That’s not normal (and nothing is)

**Pro tip**: End every sentence with “ya kho” or “saha ftourek” during Ramadan.

# 3. Adopt the Algerian Attitude

* Be chill, but *passionate*. Everyone’s laid back until you bring up football, politics, or whose mom makes the best couscous.
* Be ready to argue with *passion* and love each other like nothing happened 5 minutes later.

# 4. Eat Like an Algerian

* **Staple meals to know:**
   * *Couscous* — the king of Friday lunches.
   * *Chorba* — soup that heals both hunger and heartbreak.
   * *Mhadjeb, Bourek, Loubia, Rechta* — you’ll never be the same after.
   * *Makroud, Kalb El Louz, Baklawa* — desserts that *slap*.
* Tea = sacred. Mint tea with a sugar cube mountain. Coffee is strong enough to rewire your brain.

# 5. Know the Family Structure

* Everyone’s your *cousin*. Even if they’re not.
* Respect your elders, or risk being judged *silently but intensely*.
* Expect to be offered food 100 times before you’re allowed to say “no.”

# 6. Get Your Style Right

* **Streetwear + sandals? Sure.**
* Traditional wear during Eid or weddings: *Gandoura, Fergani, Karakou, Chedda*.
* Bonus: rock a flag on your back during any football match.

# 7. Celebrate Like a True Dzairi

* Eid? Fireworks, new outfits, and too much meat.
* Wedding? Loud music, a 3-day event minimum.
* Independence Day? Flag out. Dabke on the street. Horns blasting.

# 8. Choose a Football Team Wisely

* Club level: USMA? MCA? CRB? Choose your fighter.
* National level: **Les Fennecs forever**.
* Be emotionally prepared. Algeria will break your heart and make you proud in the same 90 minutes.

# 9. Understand the Art of Pettiness

* It’s not about the drama. It’s about the *pride*. Carry it with elegance.

If you really wanna turn Algerian, just hang around Algerians long enough and you’ll be adopted within a week. Especially if you say something nice about their mom’s cooking.

1jybtdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1jybtdl/i_asked_chatgpt_to_roast_ana_de_armas_and_this_is/,I asked ChatGPT to roast Ana de Armas and this is the result I got,"Ana de Armas? Oh, you mean the Hollywood starlet who built her career on looking vaguely like every director’s dream Latina without actually doing much else? Yeah, let’s talk about her.

Early Life – The Cuban Dream That No One Asked For

Ana was born in Cuba, a country known for cigars, classic cars, and now, apparently, producing an actress whose main talent is looking perpetually confused in every role. She supposedly grew up without the internet, which might explain why she seems blissfully unaware of how cringeworthy her filmography is. Maybe that’s why she thought being in Knock Knock with Keanu Reeves was a good career move—she didn’t have IMDb to warn her how embarrassingly bad it was.

She then moved to Spain and landed some telenovela roles. Wow, shocking. A pretty girl getting cast in soap operas? That’s never happened before. Her big role in El Internado cemented her as the kind of actress who can look sad in soft lighting, but that’s about it. It was only a matter of time before Hollywood came knocking.

Hollywood Debut – Where Hype Meets Mediocrity

Ana moved to LA and struggled because, shocker, she didn’t speak English. Imagine having the dream of being a Hollywood actress but not bothering to learn the language. That’s like deciding to be a racecar driver without knowing how to drive stick.

When she did get roles, they were mostly “hot girl with a tragic past” or some variation of “mysterious foreign woman” because, let’s be honest, that’s her entire vibe. Her first notable role in the U.S. was War Dogs, a movie people barely remember, and then came Blade Runner 2049, where she played a hologram girlfriend. Yes, a literal digital waifu. That’s not a role; that’s a screensaver with a SAG card. But because film bros have never seen a woman smile at them like that, they decided she was the new Hollywood queen.

The “Breakout” That Never Actually Happened

Then there was Knives Out, where she played… a nice girl who vomits when she lies. Oscar-worthy, truly. The fact that critics lost their minds over this performance is hilarious because she was surrounded by actual talent (Daniel Craig, Toni Collette, Jamie Lee Curtis), and yet she was just there, looking overwhelmed like she wandered onto set by accident.

Somehow, Hollywood execs saw Knives Out and thought, “Yes, this woman should play Marilyn Monroe.” Enter Blonde, one of the most embarrassing movies ever made. Ana’s attempt at playing Marilyn was like watching a drunk woman at a Halloween party try to do an impression of Some Like It Hot. Her accent was all over the place, making Marilyn sound like she grew up bouncing between Havana and a New Jersey truck stop. But of course, her fans (we’ll get to them) and the Academy had the nerve to pretend it was a masterpiece.

Dating Life – PR or Just Bad Taste?

Ana dated Ben Affleck during his “I’m sad and bloated” phase, which means she essentially got a front-row seat to one of Hollywood’s greatest midlife crises. Paparazzi couldn’t get enough of their painfully staged coffee runs, where she clutched onto Ben like he was the last avocado in Whole Foods. It was obvious she was using him for clout, and as soon as she got enough attention, she dipped. Iconic move or just another example of Hollywood social climbing? You decide.

Then she rebounded with some tech bro who looks like he works for LinkedIn. A far cry from Batman, huh?

The Fans – A Delusional Cult of Simps

Now, let’s talk about her fans, especially the ones on Reddit and social media. Ana’s stans are basically a hybrid of film bros and lonely dudes who saw Blade Runner 2049 and thought, “If only I had a Joi of my own.” They pretend to love “cinema” but in reality, they just love any actress who makes direct eye contact with the camera. These guys write long-winded essays about how she’s “the next big thing,” despite the fact that she’s been in Hollywood for nearly a decade and still hasn’t carried a successful movie.

Reddit’s r/anadearmas is a wasteland of simps who spend their days posting over-filtered pictures of her and making up fantasies about running into her at a coffee shop. Meanwhile, Twitter (or X, whatever Elon wants to call it) is full of people desperately defending her bad performances. “She was snubbed for Blonde!” No, she was lucky anyone even considered nominating her. “She’s so underrated!” No, she’s just not that good.

The Future – Where Do We Go From Here?

Ana is now at that weird crossroads where Hollywood keeps trying to make her happen, but she’s not happening. Studios push her into leading roles (Ghosted, Deep Water), but the movies bomb because people don’t actually care about her beyond her being aesthetically pleasing.

Will she eventually land a role that proves she’s more than just a pretty face? Maybe. But considering her track record, it’s more likely she’ll just keep getting cast as “mysterious, slightly sad woman with an accent” until Hollywood finds another “it girl” to hype up. Until then, her stans will continue pretending she’s the second coming of Meryl Streep while the rest of us just… move on.",0,1744562269.0,ChatGPT,1,0.5,False

The pillow wasn’t always there, she’d climb in between the gap of the couch and wall, so I blocked it with the pillow. 

Whenever she goes there she just stays there, and is reluctant to leave. Many occasions I’ve just laid down and let her explore or go where she wants, and every time she goes there and just walks around, knocking at the wall, literally the video.

I have no clue why she seems so obsessed with this spot. She can be very stubborn when I try to get her out of that spot, to the point of running from my hand if she sees I’m about to offer a finger to step on. She always returns if I do end up bringing her out.

It’s a small, family owned business, accredited by the government (I’m trying to keep the exact nature of the job somewhat vague). 

The owner reached out to me on Indeed (red flag?) and during the interview they mentioned doing training at one of the bosses houses (definitely a red flag). 

My friend suggested that I ask to do the training at a coffee shop which I’m gonna do but I’m still not convinced it isn’t a total scam.

Posting for a friend who is not on Reddit.

So, my friend had gotten arrested by the NYPD over a month ago. Ever since the arrest, not only has their left wrist been in pain and cannot fully bear weight (they still have weakness and pain with holding objects- they can’t even hold a thermos of coffee in their left hand for more than five minutes because of the pain and weakness), but they’ve also been feeling nerve pain in their right elbow whenever they place their elbow on something like a table- another spot in which they cannot bear weight without pain. They’re especially concerned with their elbow, because they really feel like that injury may be permanent nerve damage.

They’re already fighting their case with another lawyer specific for their type of case, but they’re also thinking of suing the NYPD because these injuries have been lasting longer than they expected, and have diminished their quality of life. They’re going to the urgent care now to get checked out, and to start getting referrals for specialists.

So, how likely is it to win in a case like this against the NYPD? Or, what is the likelihood that the NYPD would settle on a case like this?

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself—sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

**The Vibe:**  
Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*.

Review inside!,"Testing out the Antarctic Star Z5815NAS has been quite an experience. This nugget ice maker packs a punch with its promise to deliver chewable pebble ice on demand. I’m an ice enthusiast, and I don’t mind admitting how thrilled I was to give the machine a shot. Its tagline boasting readiness in 6 minutes certainly had my attention. Opening the box felt satisfying, as everything from the plastic scoop to the detailed manual was neatly arranged, inviting confidence in my purchase.

[Looking for Antarctic Star Z5815NAS discounts? Check Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dlm1bqr7/)

**Ease of Use**

Setting up the device required very little brainpower, which is always a delight. The one-click operation feature is as straightforward as it sounds. I filled up the water reservoir, pressed a single button, and it was off to the races. The self-cleaning functionality also takes the hassle out of maintaining the machine. A quick five-second press of the ""ICE/CLEAN"" button and the unit took care of itself. For someone who despises cleaning appliances, this is such a relief.

**Ice Production Speed**

Promises of icy goodness within six minutes sounded lofty, but let me tell you, it delivered. I timed the first batch, and just under the six-minute mark, those soft, chewable nuggets began raining into the basket. Producing up to 35 pounds of ice in 24 hours is no joke. While I haven’t tested its limits to churn overnight nonstop, a party I hosted saw the machine holding its own beautifully.

**Noise Levels**

Unlike traditional appliances that churn and whirr incessantly, this countertop beauty hums at a surprisingly low decibel. It’s not whisper-quiet but certainly subtle enough to leave conversations uninterrupted. If placed in a sleeping area like an RV, the sound might be noticeable, but it’s far from unbearable.

**Features**

This ice machine is adorned with a compact design and user-driven features. The transparent lid is a nice touch, as it lets you peek at the icy magic happening inside. Built-in indicators for low water and a full ice basket prevent overflowing or underfilling disasters. Its compact size and built-in handle make it highly portable, catering to indoor kitchens and outdoor camping adventures seamlessly. Every detail seemed designed for simplicity.

**Merits**

- Super easy-to-use one-button operation
- Quick ice-making within six minutes
- Portable and compact design
- Low noise production
- Self-cleaning feature eliminates maintenance worries

**Ice Quality & Type**

The nugget ice it produces is a game changer! These little chewable pellets are perfect companions for cocktails, iced coffees, or just munching down. They cool drinks rapidly without diluting them as much as traditional cubes. This quality makes them ideal for gatherings, especially in the sweltering summer heat. My kids, who consider ice crunching an Olympic sport, cherished this machine more than I anticipated.

**Durability**

The build feels robust, though the machine is lightweight enough to move without trouble. However, “lightweight” initially made me question its durability. Despite such thoughts, after weeks of regular use, it operates as smoothly as ever with no signs of strain. Customer reviews do hint that long-term durability could be an area of concern. I’ll keep a watchful eye in case anything changes over prolonged use.

**Other Options**

Comparing this machine to others in the market like GE Profile Opal or Frigidaire makes it evident where it shines and falters. The Antarctic Star Z5815NAS overtakes peers when it comes to speed and simplicity of operation. On the flip side, more expensive options like the GE Opal excel in sleekness and additional app-controlled features, though at a considerably higher price tag. For someone on a budget, this product hits the sweet spot.

**Warranty**

The machine does come with a warranty. However, specifics like the exact coverage or ease of service claims left me slightly unclear. Reviews suggest that warranty claims are straightforward but require reaching out to Antarctic Star customer service—a seemingly smooth process judging by others’ experiences.

**Disadvantages**

- The transparent top cover isn’t insulated, leading to quicker ice melting
- Initially confusing product manual
- Long-term durability still under observation

**Value for Money**

For the price point, this ice maker ticks almost every box. Its versatile feature set, combined with ease of operation, make it not just a worthy purchase but a possibly indispensable item for families or individuals. It might lack some premium features, but the utility it brings is unbeatable at its price.

Not looking for someone to 'check all the boxes'. Instead, I place a greater emphasis on shared values, working together on goals/interests, and leading an enriching & fulfilling life together

Open to all locations as long as you are open to figuring out how we can spend a decent amount of F2F time together. Also open to relocating to select places once we move beyond the initial phase. Ideal age range is between 36 and 45, but flexible. I am more interested in your emotional maturity and life experiences, rather than how many times you have orbited around the sun

DM if interested. Good luck!",1,1744561464.0,cf4cf,0,0.67,False
1jybiai,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jybiai,TLDR;BFP slow line progression,"First I want to preaface by saying I found some amazing women in this group that have helped immensely. Thanks to all of you! BFP on 14dpo but first line on 10dpo. Hoping for a sticky Christmas baby ✨

A little background because I know people, like myself the past couple of months, appreciate hearing what others did. 
I stopped taking hormonal birthcontrol Nov 2024 after 15+ years on it. I’m 31, DH is 33. We decided not to try until February this year due to my Masters program ending in August and I didn’t want to be super uncomfortable/ have a newborn. 
I bought Inito in October and started testing in November just to see how my cycles would pan out (havent had a natural cycle since I was a young teenager). Thankfully I ovulated every month since. I continued to use Inito to ‘avoid’ my fertile window in the mean time. 
I was naively convinced that I would be a unicorn and get pregnant cycle one of trying.  I did not drink alcohol, or coffee at all and second guessed everything I ate. Unfortunately that didnt happen and symptom spotting drove me nuts during the tww. It ended with AF coming a few days earlier than usual too. 
Husband has been taking Men’s 1 a day prenatal vitamin for the last 3 months also. 
I did some accupuncture sessions leading up to ttc but did not do one this last cycle. People believe it helps to regulate your hormones. 
I was not super shocked when I saw the BFP because my symptoms lately have been so drastically different. My boobs hurt to the point of waking me up at night. Many vivid dreams and bounts of nausea and cramps that come and go out of nowhere. My nipples have been sensitive since 3dpo and have not stopped. Typically when Im close to AF they go back to normal (probably drop of Progesterone). 

Things I changed during the BFP cycle (though we all know its not a recipe for success):
- For this month I said screw it. I’ll have my coffee when I want to, I will eat whatever I am craving but decided to continue to abstain from alcohol. Same for my husband. I was noticeably hungrier during the tww and ate every 2ish hours. 
- I tried to follow western medicine advice and keep myself “warm”. Socks and slippers around the house, slept in socks, bundled up more than my usual when going outside, not eating anything cold even water was kinda luke warm which to be honest doesn’t bother me. 
- Up until this month I was taking smartypants gummy prenatals. My lab values have never even been even close to being anemic so my Dr was not concerned about it not containing iron. For the second month of trying however, I switched to Natures Promise DHA mostly because I got sick of the gummies. 
- I upped my water intake by A LOT.  Due to feeling “dry ish” down there last month, I started drinking at least 90oz of water everyday. I did this by using the app “water minder”. Highly recommend. But it does impact afternoon cheap opks. So keep that in mind. 
- I also ordered some preseed lube. Some of the BD times we used it, some we didn’t. So hard to say if this is what did it. Time that we did I did use the aplicator but only up until the first tick mark. 
- Things I tried to eat more of almost on a daily basis: beans or lentils, cashews or other nuts, salmon, dark green vegetables, avocado, one egg a day, and clementines.",2,1744561461.0,Inito,2,1.0,False

**The Responsibility Of Prayer**

**(Part # 1)**

 

Brothers and Sisters there are many Responsibilities that we have as being a Born Again, Blood Bought, Two go Hand In Hand, The Word and Prayer, but today, I’ll be speaking on Prayer.

 

Prayer is Not just Speaking to God (The Father, Son and Holy Spirit), but takes on a Responsibility of Becoming Like God. As I said in the beginning, The Word and Prayer Walk Hand In Hand, for you cannot have The Word without a Relationship with God, nor can you have Prayer without a Relationship with God, but the Two can be Separated.

 

Though Prayers can bleed over into different arena’s, there is a Set Course that Prayer are Categorized dealing with Men, Women and Children. I will start with the Head Of The House, The Man, Not the Woman. If you just look at Prayer as a way to Just Communicate then you have been Taught Wrong! Prayer is Communication, but takes on a Responsibility from Who Is Speaking, Building a Relationship With Jesus.

 

Now, before we begin this, we must Understand the Roles of Mankind to be able to Understand their part in the Responsibility in Prayer. To All OF YOU, Liberals, Homosexuals, Men, Women and Children, I do NOT Care What Society says, what the World has Conformed to, the Below Scriptures is what God Says and it Over Rides anything else that Man, Woman, Child or Satan can come up with!!!

 

**Exodus 20:12 KJV**

**“Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.""**

 

**1 Corinthians 11:3 KJV**

**“But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman \[is\] the man; and the head of Christ \[is\] God.""**

 

**Ephesians 5:23 KJV**

**“For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.""**

 

So, then, Man is the Head of the House, in All Things both Small and Great, God has made Him Responsible for everything dealing with His House both Inside, Outside and Worldly. Upon Man The Father put Man in Charge that All Things are done Godly. On Earth, as far as Mankind, there is No Greater Responsibility that has been given, it has Not Changed since The Father Created Man IN His Image!

 

Without going any further, you can see that The Father put upon Man an Equivalence of The Father. The Father in Heaven is Responsible for All of Heaven and The Works there of and Man is Responsible for All of His Household and The Works there of. The Father made Man in His Image, not Woman’s or anyone else’s.

 

**Psalm 5:3 KJV**

**“My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct \[my prayer\] unto thee, and will look up.""**

 

**Psalm 119:104-105 KJV –**

**""****^(104)** **Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.** **^(105)** **NUN. Thy word \[is\] a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.""**

 

The First Thing Every Man should do, before he makes coffee or some kind of drink, before doing anything, He needs to Start His Day in Prayer, this is what makes Jesus Lord Over Your Life in part. To clarify this, after having your Daily Sleep and you wake up, the very First Thing is to go to Jesus In Prayer. The Clarification is that not everyone works days nor nights.

 

The next step is to Praise Jesus for the Sleep that you have Received, the Rest you have Received and thanking Jesus that He has given you another day to Worship and Praise Him in this New Day that He Has Given You.

 

**Psalm 118:24 KJV**

**“This \[is\] the day \[which\] the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.""**

 

**Lamentations 3:22-25 KJV**

**""****^(22)** **\[It is of\] the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.** **^(23)** **\[They are\] new every morning: great \[is\] thy faithfulness.** **^(24)** **The LORD \[is\] my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.** **^(25)** **The LORD \[is\] good unto them that wait for him, to the soul \[that\] seeketh him.""**

 

Thus far, every person, Man, Woman and Child can start their Daily Prayer in what has been mentioned, but now comes specifics for The Man Of God.

 

Man has the Responsibility to Lift Up His Wife(helpmate) in such fashion, that She will Submit Herself to Jesus every waking moment of every day, meaning as well, that She Commits herself to Walk In Obedience to The Word and to The Holy Spirit. The Man Prays that His Wife(helpmate), will have a Blessed Day in her Goings and Comings. The Man Prays that His Wife will Listen For and To The Holy Spirit and Be Obedient to His Voice.

 

The Man Prays for any Health Issues that she maybe having, that she would be Healed from such things or to bring an Understanding to The Why. The Man Prays for any Task, Projects, that she needs to do, that she will do them in Peace, Joy and Love. The Man Prays against anything that the Enemies of God are trying to do against her. This is different than Praying for her Protection, these here are Attacks that the Enemies of God are doing to her in whatever Weak Spot she is fighting currently. In this The Man will Pray for her to Overcome or to Learn whatever The Holy Spirit is trying to Teach her.

 

The Man Prays for his wife to Bear Witness to those around her throughout the day, that Jesus may be Glorified.

 

The Man Prays that a Double Hedge Of Thorns be place around her and that Guardian Angles would Surround her all the day long.

 

The Man Prays for his wife that Every Open Door from Jesus, would Remain Open and that Every Closed Door from Jesus would Remain Closed. Needing to have an Understanding here, The Man has Prayed Three Different Protections around his wife, each having a Specific Result In The Answer.

 

The Man Prays, that anything that the Two Of Them are at Odds, that they will come into Agreement with each other According to The Fathers Will. That his wife would Yield to her Husband as The Head Of The House if need be and that The Man is Not Deaf to Her Voice or Needs. Here is a BIG SHOCKER FOR YOU… Pray about Sex, in All Area’s, who do you think Created Sex in the first place!!!

 

The Man Prays that Jesus will Fill her With Peace, Joy and Love, having Mercy and Grace abound to her!

 

Now for the Children.

 

The Man Prays that Their Lives would start the Day with Jesus, that they would Yield to The Holy Spirit in All of Their Ways.

 

The Man Prays that the children will not give in to peer pressures that are thrown at them on a daily bases.

 

The Man Prays about their Classes, especially those that they are struggling with.

 

The Man Prays for a Good Relationship with His Children, that they can come to him with All of their Issues, Wants and Needs.

 

The Man Prays for Connective Points Of Interest between him and his children, things they can Enjoy doing together.

 

The Man Prays for Any Issues or Struggles that are in Their Lives.

 

The Man Prays for Their Friends and for those who have Influence over them, that they would be connected with Godly Children.

 

The Man Prays for his children to Walk In Obedience with their Dad and Mom.

 

The Man Prays for His Children’s Future in general to specific.

 

The Man Prays for Blessings upon them, filled with Peace, Joy and Love. Also that All that they Do and Say will be done in Peace, Joy and Love, bearing Witness to Who Jesus is To Them.

 

The Man Prays a Double Hedge Of Thorns around his children and that Guardian Angles be around about them to Protect them against the Enemies of God.

 

The Man Prays this like prayer unto the First, Second, Third and Fourth Generations and for Their Spouses, that first that they Come to Know Jesus as Their Savior and Lord, that if they do not know Jesus as Savior and Lord that Jesus would send someone to them, that they Might have an opportunity to do so. The Man would also Pray that they would Walk In Obedience to The Word and The Holy Spirit. Now you may ask why do I need to Pray for the First, Second, Third and Fourth Generations…

 

**Exodus 20:5 KJV**

**“Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God \[am\] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth \[generation\] of them that hate me;""**

 

 

By nature, because of Adam, Sin reigns in our lives from the womb forward, making us the Enemies of God, until we Accept Jesus as Savior and Lord.

 

The Man Prays for Direction and Guidance for His Family in making Decisions on a Daily Bases. The Man Prays for Any and All Future Events that maybe coming. This could be for Vacations, Schooling, Promotions, and Opportunities in general.

 

Now for the Man himself.

 

The Man Prays in Thanksgiving and Praise for What Jesus Has Done, Is Doing and Will Do. The Man Prays in Thanksgiving and Praise for Jesus Mercy and Grace that is upon him and for Jesus Love that is Abound To Him

 

The Man Prays in Thanksgiving and Praise for His Vehicles (be specific, if you have a truck and the wife has a car, separate the two, do not pray a general all as one), I Thank You Jesus for My House(building) and The Blessings There Of, I Thank You Jesus for My Utilities and The Blessings There Of, I Thank You Jesus for My Health and The Blessings There Of and for Any Healing Needed, I Thank You Jesus for My Job and The Blessings There Of and also for any Work Related issues, also to ask Jesus for His Direction, Guidance, Wisdom, Knowledge and Understanding There Of to do Your Job to the Best of Your Ability to bring Jesus Praise, Honor and Glory in All that You May Say and Do.

 

The Man Prays for any Friends or Family.

 

The Man Prays for any Ministry, Needs, Desires, Issues.

 

The Man Prays for The Peace Of Israel with herself and her enemies round about her.

 

The Man Surrenders All that he has said and all that he has unto Jesus, making Jesus Lord Over Everything.

 

Now because of the fashion in which I Pray, I lay Prostrate on the floor with hands stretched out, because I cannot get any lower before Jesus. At the end of my Prayer, when I Surrender everything, I slide back into a kneeling point with my hands crossed, palms up, showing nothing within my hands, that I have Given Everything To Jesus before I say my Last Amen and Amen!!! It may seem to some that it is not important to do as I do, but, it is Not Symbolic, it is What Is In My Heart to do so. I Understand fully the Responsibility that has been placed upon my shoulders, both as a Man, a Husband, a Dad and as an Apostle. Prayer is not a “Five and Dime” and done. It should be taken with as much Caution, as much Honesty, even if your angry and do not understand, or frustrated, Jesus already knows, but He Requires us to be In A Relationship With Him, not just a type of club!

 

Men and Women, you Need to Understand, that Prayer is Not just Words we Speak Hoping that all goes well. Prayer is Our Relationship Builder between Us and God, it is also Our Warfare against Satan and his demons, and against Mankind who Opposes God. There is nothing more Powerful, has More Authority then Our Prayers that God has given us. By Our Prayers, we Become More In The Likeness Of The Father in Our Lives for The World to see!!!

 

Today, I only covered the Men, next week I will cover the Women and Children.

 

 

 

 

**Amen and Amen!!!**
