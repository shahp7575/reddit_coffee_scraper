1kqa945,https://www.reddit.com/r/istanbul_tips/comments/1kqa945/route_and_transportation_tips_elderly_tourist_in/,Route and Transportation Tips - Elderly tourist in Istanbul,"Hi everyone!

I'm planning a day in Istanbul for an elderly family member (late 70s, mobile but tires quickly, prefers minimal walking and shaded/rested breaks). I'd love your advice on the best transport routes between these stops — especially ways to avoid unnecessary walking or heat.

Here’s the basic itinerary: (Saturday)

* **8:30 AM – Hagia Sophia + Blue Mosque**
* **11:00 AM – Early lunch at Seven Hills Restaurant** (short walk again)
* **12:30 PM – Taxi to Grand Bazaar** (mostly browsing or may skip)
* **1:15 PM – Taxi to Galata Tower** (just a photo and coffee stop )
* **2:00 PM – Taxi to Ortaköy Mosque** (light Bosphorus walk, tea/snack)
* **3:30 PM – Finish: Eat near Ortaköy or taxi back to AirBnb**

**My questions:**

1. Are taxis reliable for these short trips? Do we need to use an app (BiTaksi?) or can we hail easily?
2. Is there a better alternative to taxis for comfort and ease?
3. Are any of these routes better done by tram, ferry, or something else?
4. Are there any accessibility or walking concerns I should know between these stops (e.g., stairs, steep hills)?
5. Would you suggest adjusting this plan for any reason? Are any of the locations closed?",1,1747657186.0,istanbul_tips,0,1.0,False

He’s my type (looks innocent and sweet, wears glasses, soft boy) kaya I did the first move 😭 Di ko feel vibe niya at first, parang nonchalant kasi HAHA pero eventually lumipat kami sa Instagram. 

We talked casually lang for a few days, tamang landian and then dumating sa point na nagpaparinig siya about cuddles. At first, he’s willing na mag coffee talaga kami pero siyempre go w the flow inheat si ate gorl so I’m like okay why not 💀 

Fast forward, everything changed after the deed—in a good way. I saw qualities in him that I never saw sa iba, ang bf material talaga. Empathetic, gentleman, mabait, academically inclined, caring, etc. Of course ang suspicious nga na ang bilis ng pangyayari kasi he was very open about having a serious relationship already. He assured me rin na ako lang daw naka-witness ng wild side niya (besides his ex), talks about the future (if ever maging legal kami), mga dates namin ganorn. We also had plans of meeting up in the future and gave me assurance na sasamahan niya ko sa mga errands ko.

Little did I know, isa lang pala ako sa mga babae niya 🥲. This one girl (19 F) messaged me using a dummy account. I never knew makaka-receive ako ng “Hey girl, I know that you don’t know me” kineme. I was not even surprised pero very disappointed. I was very hurt about what she told me. They fucked daw 5 days after we did the deed haha what a joke! Everything felt like a lie. Excuse niya sa’kin noon was he’ll help his tito sa Shopee pick up para daw may pera siya pang ci namin, yun pala he’s with another girl that time. Even though parang 1 week lang yung connection namin (or so I thought), I was ready to become serious and change for him (kasi I had a roster). Same situation kami ni girl, first meet up, binembang💀 and we also dropped the hoes for this broke man + they met rin on Bumble LMAOOO

Besides that, the girl told me na may “main girl” daw si koya.. Since January pa daw sila “no label rs”. Of course I was like 💀 shit. Tatlo pala kami, I was the last one to know about the whole thing. They were even hesitant to reach out, pero I’m glad that one girl did 🥲 (even though ang sarcastic niya most of the time pero sige gew girl). Dami niyang kinwento in detail na nakaka-wtf talaga 🥲 She also mentioned na “ako daw mas mahal” kasi nga we talked consistently and I live near him. Kumbaga ako daw mas “convenient”. Eh dry daw kasi si ate girl and si Main Girl naman nagkakalabuan na sila dati pa. 

To conclude, I wish na he was clear with his intentions instead of playing us girls 🤣 (kala mo napaka-good boy na lover boy yun pala may kahati akiz aguy). Sa main girl, they still follow each other pa ata—sige you can keep him. She sent us a paragraph pa na yun nga ginago kami, we need to move on and that she knows the guy better yada yada. He also sent me a paragraph apologizing even though ang insincere huhu. Pero yeah, I wanna heal on my own now even though never naman naging kami and it was short-lived (once lang kami nagmeet).",2,1747657092.0,MayConfessionAko,0,1.0,False

Hey hackers,
I’m thinking about building a scheduling tool like Calendly, but specifically for indie hackers.
Something lightweight, fast, and focused on our use cases — like syncing with your project time zones, showcasing what you’re working on, and making it easy to book quick coffee chats or collab calls.

Before I dive in, I’d love to hear from you:

How do you currently schedule meetings or collabs?

Do you face any annoyances with tools like Calendly or SavvyCal?

To make it short, following a breakup I went back on dating apps couple weeks ago after almost 4 years. I remember that at time I had few matches but most of them turned into meeting and one even became a 3 years relationships. 

Fast-forward to today, I got a lot more matches than in the past and even got 5 different girls agreeing to go for a coffee/drink. Now the funny and sad part arrives, ALL of them cancelled/rescheduled the date shortly before we were supposed to meet(<24 hours). Only one girl gave a good and honest excuse. All the others came up with poor justifications. I also try to schedule the date in the following 72 hours, so the change of mind comes really from one night to the other. 

  
What is going on here? Does this also happen to others (boys and girls, hetero and homo)?

  
I don't mind being rejected, but I mind when other make me lose time and mental energy...

1kqa55m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kqa55m/i_feel_like_im_addicted_to_cold_approaching_women/,I feel like I’m addicted to cold approaching women despite overall poor results.  Does anyone have advice for shifting my dating strategies into something less esteem destroying and life consuming?,"Terms: PUA: pick-up artist Cold approach: initiating a conversation with a woman you don’t know.

About me: 28M.  Biggest issue is obesity (41 BMI) which I’m steadily working on.  Biggest pros are a solid career, humor, fun hobby (live music/festivals very frequently) & have been working on my mental health steadily for 2.5 years.

The situation: I’m addicted to “cold approach” and watching PUA content despite it not having the best results for me.  I’ve probably been rejected around 2000 times at places like coffee shops, museums, parks, libraries, malls, concerts, etc…. I’ve gotten something like a dozen first dates from it, and 2 of them ended up going very well.  I like to think I take rejection very gracefully, but I am in hindsight sometimes creepy with how I approach (lingering too long before saying something).

Despite all this effort, I am technically still a virgin.  I’ve gotten a blowjob and fingered my ex, but never had PIV sex.  The mass rejection has taken a huge toll on my self esteem, even if I also am proud of how much resilience and social initiative its taken.

The more pressing concern for me is I feel like it dominates my life.  Have a few hours free?  I go do approaches.  Going to a concert?  Must scan around for solo women to talk to.  Considering going to a meetup?  Only if there’s likely to be single women there.  Text my friends to hangout or go out solo to bars?  Bars it is.  Flying out solo?  Definitely going to be starting a convo at the airport.  Going grocery shopping? Definitely going to be scanning the aisles for more than just food.  Even in social group settings, I can’t help but preoccupied trying to plot ways to talk to the girls at the event.  Sometimes I’ll go out for hours just to approach, approach no one, and feel like I just wasted a colossal amount of time.  I feel like this is preventing me from forming natural social relationships that might more organically lead to a relationship for me.  I feel like the steady dose of rejection has made me question how it’d be possible for anyone to ever be interested in me when I have such a huge sample of people who aren’t.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?  Can anyone otherwise give advice?

I feel like my options moving forward are: (A) complete ban on dating for 12-18 months until I get back in shape and learn to stop compulsively approaching women (B) limit myself to like 3 approaches / week and focus on ones that seem like quality opportunities rather than just spamming it (C) keep going like I’ve been going, I have gotten some results and the girlfriend is bound to be found eventually.

Working with several ecommerce brands has helped us see how small tweaks to listings can lead to massive jumps in visibility. 

Using keyword strategy and the right[ digital shelf analytics](https://www.42signals.com/digital-shelf-analytics/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) insights is one part of the puzzle to appear at the top of search results. Here are a few ways you can ensure your product listings consistently appear at the top of search results and aren’t buried. 

**Lessons for Amazon Search Optimization**

There are a few important considerations to keep in mind when selling on Amazon. Proper product descriptions, hi-res images, using the right keywords, and optimizing based on[ competitor performance](https://www.42signals.com/blog/ecommerce-competitor-analysis-template/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025). 

**Competitor Analysis Dashboard**

42Signals’[ competitor analysis and keyword suggestions](https://www.42signals.com/blog/optimize-product-information/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) feature:

**1.** **Crack Amazon’s Algorithm: What Most Sellers Miss**

Amazon’s algorithm isn’t as mysterious as some make it seem. At its core, it prioritizes two things: relevance and performance. But here’s where sellers go wrong: They treat these as separate pillars. In reality, they’re intertwined.

For example, a product with perfect keyword relevance but poor reviews will tank. Conversely, a 5-star product with sloppy titles won’t rank. 

For Amazon search optimization:

**Relevance Hack**: Use Amazon’s autocomplete feature. Type your main keyword (e.g., “yoga mats”) into Amazon’s search bar. The suggestions that pop up (“yoga mats for hot yoga,” “yoga mats eco-friendly”) are goldmines. Integrate these phrases into your title and bullets.

**Performance Hack**: Focus on[ sales velocity](https://www.42signals.com/blog/share-of-search-analysis-guide/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025). Amazon rewards products that convert quickly. Run short-term promotions or coupons to spike sales, which can trigger the algorithm to boost your rankings.

**Real-World Example**: A client selling reusable straws struggled with rankings until we added the autocomplete phrase “silicone straws for 40 oz tumblers” to their title. Sales jumped 25% in a week.

**2. Amazon Search Terms Optimization: The Hidden Gems**

Optimizing listings with generic keywords won’t help your business anymore. Competition has increased tenfold, so brands need to ensure the right secondary and semantic keywords are added that consumers are searching for. 

**a. Steal Competitors’ Weaknesses**

Tools like 42Signals’[ keyword rank tracker](https://www.42signals.com/blog/amazon-keyword-strategy/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) feature let you understand the keywords competitors’ products rank for, which allows you to leverage the same and show up next to each other. Look for gaps. If rival listings omit terms like “non-toxic” or “BPA-free,” add those to your backend.

**b. Use Customer Language, Not Jargon**

Forget industry terms. If shoppers search “gluten-free pancake mix” instead of “GF breakfast batter,” match their wording. Tools like AnswerThePublic can reveal how real customers phrase queries. 

**c. Rotate Keywords Seasonally**

Update backend terms quarterly. During holidays, add “gift” or “stocking stuffer.” In summer, terms like “travel-friendly” or “beach-ready” work wonders. A lot of people are switching to search for products based on their activity or travel needs so using those keywords just ensures your page shows up for the right searches. 

**3. The Keyword Ranking Dashboard: Your Secret Weapon**

A keyword rank tracker dashboard is useful for strategizing. This is how to find keywords that matter to you on platforms such as 42Signals and identifying keywords that matter to you:

* **Identify Leaks**: Prioritize ""Bluetooth headphones for gym"" on page 4 rather than ""wireless headphones"" on page 2.
* **Spot Competitor Moves**: Notice a rival suddenly ranking for “vegan leather handbags”? Reverse-engineer their strategy. Did they add new images? Lower prices? This data can be easily tracked with tools like[ 42Signals](https://www.42signals.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025), but also manually if you have only a handful of products. 
* **Test and Refine**: Mess with listing titles. For example, let's say from an[ A/B test you learned](https://www.42signals.com/blog/a-b-testing-for-e-commerce-conversion-optimization-a-beginners-guide/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) changing ""organic"" to ""natural"" in your title increased rankings; go ahead and change your dashboard tags accordingly. Use disparate platforms to track and improve when such keywords show up on other marketplaces instead. 

Pro Tip: Pair your dashboard with Google Trends. If “sourdough baking kits” is trending, but your ranking is stagnant, launch a PPC campaign to capitalize.

**4. Share of Search: Why It Matters More Than You Think**

Your[ share of search](https://www.42signals.com/blog/share-of-search-analysis-guide/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) is your visibility “market share” in your niche. This lends perspective to the space itself or the volume of search that a brand occupies on a market with other competitors. It is intertwined with Amazon’s search optimization in many ways, as it’s directly related to visibility.

* **Hire Traffic from Your Competitors**: With resources such as Semrush, you can research keywords where your competitors rank really poorly. If they cannot come out strong on ergonomic office chair for tall people, own that phrase and write many articles and product descriptions with such keywords. 
* **Optimize for Amazon’s “Easter Egg” Features**: Ever notice “Highly Rated” or “Climate Pledge Friendly” badges? These tags increase share of search. To qualify, focus on sustainability (e.g., FSC-certified packaging) and maintain a 4.3+ star rating.
* **Case Study**: A coffee brand increased its share of search by 18% after reformulating its packaging to meet Amazon’s Climate Pledge requirements.

**5. Digital Shelf Analytics: The Overlooked Game-Changer**

[Digital shelf analytics tools](https://www.42signals.com/blog/digital-shelf-analytics-what-is-it/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) like 42Signals analyze how your product “looks” compared to competitors. In simple terms, digital shelf analytics allows you to understand your brand’s complete presence on all digital platforms in intuitive dashboards. 

* **Image Insights**: Are your product images smaller or of lower quality than competitors? Upsize them. Amazon favors listings with high-resolution, lifestyle-focused photos.
* [**Price Positioning**](https://www.42signals.com/blog/amazon-pricing-strategies-for-competitive-edge/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025): If your product is priced 20% above competitors but lacks clear differentiation, you’ll lose the Buy Box. Use analytics to adjust in real time, as sleeping on this information for weeks on end can create lasting damage. 
* **Review Sentiment**: Tools like 42Signals’ voice of customer analytics can flag negative reviews dragging down your conversion rate. These are so important when customers have a huge pool of items to choose from; the right mix of positive and negative reviews (not fake) builds confidence in the product and conversions. 

**6. Amazon Data & Keyword Suggestions: The Insider Playbook**

Amazon's Brand Analytics (ABA) is really embedded with data. If your brand exists solely on the platform, it is certainly beneficial to look at the analytics.

* **ABA Search Terms Report**: Filter keywords for highest conversion and low competition. For example, a term like ""men's wide width hiking boots"" might have 5% conversion as opposed to 2% for ""hiking boots."" 
* **Cross-Reference with Google Keyword Planner**: ""Collagen peptides for joints"" might be trending on Google; however, if it is not present on ABA, then it should be put in the backend. Buyers may be using the same word to search throughout platforms. 
* **Ride the Seasonal Shifts**: Before the Prime Day, look for terms that are climbing like ""Prime Day deals"" or ""lightning sale"" on ABA. Get listings prepared ahead of time. 
* **In real life**: One supplement brand found the term “probiotic for women over 40” in ABA, made a product variant for it, and captured 32% of the niche within six months.

**7. The Dark Horse: Amazon’s Search Optimization Performance Report**

Buried in Amazon’s Seller Central, this report shows which search terms actually convert. Most sellers ignore it. Don’t be one of them. 

* Double Down on Winners: If “biodegradable dog poop bags” converts at 8%, optimize everything—images, bullets, PPC, around this term. 
* Prune Losers: If “eco-friendly trash bags” has a 0.5% conversion rate, replace it with a better-performing term.

**Master the Algorithm, Own the Results**

[Amazon search optimization](https://www.42signals.com/blog/amazon-search-optimization-techniques/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) requires finesse, the right tools, and the right strategies that boost discoverability. As Amazon’s rules change constantly, what works today may not work tomorrow. 

Stay nimble. Test everything. And never stop mining Amazon data for those game-changing keyword suggestions.

Use disparate platforms to track and improve when such keywords show up on other marketplaces instead. 

Pro Tip: Pair your dashboard with Google Trends. If “sourdough baking kits” is trending, but your ranking is stagnant, launch a PPC campaign to capitalize.

**4. Share of Search: Why It Matters More Than You Think**

Your[ share of search](https://www.42signals.com/blog/share-of-search-analysis-guide/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) is your visibility “market share” in your niche. This lends perspective to the space itself or the volume of search that a brand occupies on a market with other competitors. It is intertwined with Amazon’s search optimization in many ways, as it’s directly related to visibility.

* **Hire Traffic from Your Competitors**: With resources such as Semrush, you can research keywords where your competitors rank really poorly. If they cannot come out strong on ergonomic office chair for tall people, own that phrase and write many articles and product descriptions with such keywords. 
* **Optimize for Amazon’s “Easter Egg” Features**: Ever notice “Highly Rated” or “Climate Pledge Friendly” badges? These tags increase share of search. To qualify, focus on sustainability (e.g., FSC-certified packaging) and maintain a 4.3+ star rating.
* **Case Study**: A coffee brand increased its share of search by 18% after reformulating its packaging to meet Amazon’s Climate Pledge requirements.

**5. Digital Shelf Analytics: The Overlooked Game-Changer**

[Digital shelf analytics tools](https://www.42signals.com/blog/digital-shelf-analytics-what-is-it/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) like 42Signals analyze how your product “looks” compared to competitors. In simple terms, digital shelf analytics allows you to understand your brand’s complete presence on all digital platforms in intuitive dashboards. 

* **Image Insights**: Are your product images smaller or of lower quality than competitors? Upsize them. Amazon favors listings with high-resolution, lifestyle-focused photos.
* [**Price Positioning**](https://www.42signals.com/blog/amazon-pricing-strategies-for-competitive-edge/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025): If your product is priced 20% above competitors but lacks clear differentiation, you’ll lose the Buy Box. Use analytics to adjust in real time, as sleeping on this information for weeks on end can create lasting damage. 
* **Review Sentiment**: Tools like 42Signals’ voice of customer analytics can flag negative reviews dragging down your conversion rate. These are so important when customers have a huge pool of items to choose from; the right mix of positive and negative reviews (not fake) builds confidence in the product and conversions. 

**6. Amazon Data & Keyword Suggestions: The Insider Playbook**

Amazon's Brand Analytics (ABA) is really embedded with data. If your brand exists solely on the platform, it is certainly beneficial to look at the analytics.

* **ABA Search Terms Report**: Filter keywords for highest conversion and low competition. For example, a term like ""men's wide width hiking boots"" might have 5% conversion as opposed to 2% for ""hiking boots."" 
* **Cross-Reference with Google Keyword Planner**: ""Collagen peptides for joints"" might be trending on Google; however, if it is not present on ABA, then it should be put in the backend. Buyers may be using the same word to search throughout platforms. 
* **Ride the Seasonal Shifts**: Before the Prime Day, look for terms that are climbing like ""Prime Day deals"" or ""lightning sale"" on ABA. Get listings prepared ahead of time. 
* **In real life**: One supplement brand found the term “probiotic for women over 40” in ABA, made a product variant for it, and captured 32% of the niche within six months.

**7. The Dark Horse: Amazon’s Search Optimization Performance Report**

Buried in Amazon’s Seller Central, this report shows which search terms actually convert. Most sellers ignore it. Don’t be one of them. 

* Double Down on Winners: If “biodegradable dog poop bags” converts at 8%, optimize everything—images, bullets, PPC, around this term. 
* Prune Losers: If “eco-friendly trash bags” has a 0.5% conversion rate, replace it with a better-performing term.

Working with several ecommerce brands has helped us see how small tweaks to listings can lead to massive jumps in visibility. 

Using keyword strategy and the right[ digital shelf analytics](https://www.42signals.com/digital-shelf-analytics/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) insights is one part of the puzzle to appear at the top of search results. Here are a few ways you can ensure your product listings consistently appear at the top of search results and aren’t buried. 

**Lessons for Amazon Search Optimization**

There are a few important considerations to keep in mind when selling on Amazon. Proper product descriptions, hi-res images, using the right keywords, and optimizing based on[ competitor performance](https://www.42signals.com/blog/ecommerce-competitor-analysis-template/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025). 

**Competitor Analysis Dashboard**

42Signals’[ competitor analysis and keyword suggestions](https://www.42signals.com/blog/optimize-product-information/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) feature:

**1.** **Crack Amazon’s Algorithm: What Most Sellers Miss**

Amazon’s algorithm isn’t as mysterious as some make it seem. At its core, it prioritizes two things: relevance and performance. But here’s where sellers go wrong: They treat these as separate pillars. In reality, they’re intertwined.

For example, a product with perfect keyword relevance but poor reviews will tank. Conversely, a 5-star product with sloppy titles won’t rank. 

For Amazon search optimization:

**Relevance Hack**: Use Amazon’s autocomplete feature. Type your main keyword (e.g., “yoga mats”) into Amazon’s search bar. The suggestions that pop up (“yoga mats for hot yoga,” “yoga mats eco-friendly”) are goldmines. Integrate these phrases into your title and bullets.

**Performance Hack**: Focus on[ sales velocity](https://www.42signals.com/blog/share-of-search-analysis-guide/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025). Amazon rewards products that convert quickly. Run short-term promotions or coupons to spike sales, which can trigger the algorithm to boost your rankings.

**Real-World Example**: A client selling reusable straws struggled with rankings until we added the autocomplete phrase “silicone straws for 40 oz tumblers” to their title. Sales jumped 25% in a week.

**2. Amazon Search Terms Optimization: The Hidden Gems**

Optimizing listings with generic keywords won’t help your business anymore. Competition has increased tenfold, so brands need to ensure the right secondary and semantic keywords are added that consumers are searching for. 

**a. Steal Competitors’ Weaknesses**

Tools like 42Signals’[ keyword rank tracker](https://www.42signals.com/blog/amazon-keyword-strategy/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) feature let you understand the keywords competitors’ products rank for, which allows you to leverage the same and show up next to each other. Look for gaps. If rival listings omit terms like “non-toxic” or “BPA-free,” add those to your backend.

**b. Use Customer Language, Not Jargon**

Forget industry terms. If shoppers search “gluten-free pancake mix” instead of “GF breakfast batter,” match their wording. Tools like AnswerThePublic can reveal how real customers phrase queries. 

**c. Rotate Keywords Seasonally**

Update backend terms quarterly. During holidays, add “gift” or “stocking stuffer.” In summer, terms like “travel-friendly” or “beach-ready” work wonders. A lot of people are switching to search for products based on their activity or travel needs so using those keywords just ensures your page shows up for the right searches. 

**3. The Keyword Ranking Dashboard: Your Secret Weapon**

A keyword rank tracker dashboard is useful for strategizing. This is how to find keywords that matter to you on platforms such as 42Signals and identifying keywords that matter to you:

* **Identify Leaks**: Prioritize ""Bluetooth headphones for gym"" on page 4 rather than ""wireless headphones"" on page 2.
* **Spot Competitor Moves**: Notice a rival suddenly ranking for “vegan leather handbags”? Reverse-engineer their strategy. Did they add new images? Lower prices? This data can be easily tracked with tools like[ 42Signals](https://www.42signals.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025), but also manually if you have only a handful of products. 
* **Test and Refine**: Mess with listing titles. For example, let's say from an[ A/B test you learned](https://www.42signals.com/blog/a-b-testing-for-e-commerce-conversion-optimization-a-beginners-guide/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialpost_19may2025) changing ""organic"" to ""natural"" in your title increased rankings; go ahead and change your dashboard tags accordingly.

Hi. I'm 30(M) and been in a relationship with the same gender for 6 years now. Yes, I'm a bisexual. Discreet kami parehas and nobody knows our relationship for 6 years na except sa mga few friends ko at few friends nya. Medyo LDR lang kami kasi he's in Manila at dito naman ako sa province.

Alam ko mali but recently I install the universal gay app. You know na yan. The reason? Maybe because im longing or pampalipas oras lang. Bored.

Just recently may nakachat ako na guy. He's 30 and may girlfriend sya. Yes, gf. Same kami na may partner. Tago sya at sobrang discreet. I asked him bakit sya andun and nagbigay naman sya ng reasons. Then starting from there halos lagi na kami magkausap sa tg. He's so good in conversations as in wala kaming empty spaces. Same na same kami ng wavelength. Hanggang sa nag meet kami. Lagi syang nag uupdate saken at nag sosorry kapag hindi nakakapagmessage kasi nga busy sa work plus kapag kasama nya gf nya.

Then we decided na magkita ulit then we had coffee and dinner. Pagkauwi nya nag message pa sya saken pero the next day wala na hanggang sa isang linggo na ang nakalipas. I assure him na hindi ko sya gagambalain or mag dedemand na mag message sya kasi nga tropa lang kami and i do respect his private space. But that 1 week na hindi kami magkausap ay sobrang iniisip ko sya. Alam ko na mali talaga to from the very start kasi may partner kami both. At para saken i can't afford to loose my partner, mahal na mahal ko un. Pero ngayon bakit si guy ang lagi ko iniisip. 

Then hanggang sa mag message sya after 1 week. He explained na na guilty sya sa ginawa namin. Pero ngayon ready na sya makipag usap saken. Pero i can feel the coldness. 

Maling mali na sya lagi ang naiisip ko. Pero i cant help it. Lagi ako nag checheck kung may message na sya. Ayoko ng ganito kasi i do have a partner. But i guess im so into him. Pero i know talo ako.

Please enlighten me on what to do.

However the leases can’t be the only thing holding back our downtown. I went on Sunday and absolutely nothing was open, it was 11 am, we walked to old Quebec street to visit the dollar store, closed. Decided we’d grab a coffee a Capistrano, closed. Walked past the Guelph farmers market hoping it might be open, closed. Thankfully Kanoo was open (shout out to a cafe open on a Sunday!)

While I get there would be an adjusted schedule on a Sunday in a small/medium downtown - things need to change if you expect to change perception of downtown, it’s not 1960, people shop on sundays. Folks from the east end, south and west will continue shopping at the mall or big box stores because they know they’re open. I live downtown so I’ll continue to shop there but if someone from the south end had the experience I just had, they might not return. 

I’m not a small business owner so I don’t know the complexities of keeping store hours but if to the going to be closed on a Monday, and possibly Tuesday; you need to open on a Sunday when people are out and about wanting to spend money.

PUA: pick-up artist
Cold approach: initiating a conversation with a woman you don’t know.

About me: 28M.  Biggest issue is obesity (41 BMI) which I’m steadily working on.  Biggest pros are a solid career, humor, fun hobby (live music/festivals very frequently) & have been working on my mental health steadily for 2.5 years.  

The situation: I’m addicted to “cold approach” and watching PUA content despite it not having the best results for me.  I’ve probably been rejected around 2000 times at places like coffee shops, museums, parks, libraries, malls, concerts, etc…. I’ve gotten something like a dozen first dates from it, and 2 of them ended up going very well.  I like to think I take rejection very gracefully, but I am in hindsight sometimes creepy with how I approach (lingering too long before saying something).

Despite all this effort, I am technically still a virgin.  I’ve gotten a blowjob and fingered my ex, but never had PIV sex.  The mass rejection has taken a huge toll on my self esteem, even if I also am proud of how much resilience and social initiative its taken.  

The more pressing concern for me is I feel like it dominates my life.  Have a few hours free?  I go do approaches.  Going to a concert?  Must scan around for solo women to talk to.  Considering going to a meetup?  Only if there’s likely to be single women there.  Text my friends to hangout or go out solo to bars?  Bars it is.  Flying out solo?  Definitely going to be starting a convo at the airport.  Going grocery shopping? Definitely going to be scanning the aisles for more than just food.  Even in social group settings, I can’t help but preoccupied trying to plot ways to talk to the girls at the event.  Sometimes I’ll go out for hours just to approach, approach no one, and feel like I just wasted a colossal amount of time.  I feel like this is preventing me from forming natural social relationships that might more organically lead to a relationship for me.  I feel like the steady dose of rejection has made me question how it’d be possible for anyone to ever be interested in me when I have such a huge sample of people who aren’t.  

Has anyone been in a similar situation?  Can anyone otherwise give advice?

I feel like my options moving forward are:
(A) complete ban on dating for 12-18 months until I get back in shape and learn to stop compulsively approaching women
(B) limit myself to like 3 approaches / week and focus on ones that seem like quality opportunities rather than just spamming it
(C) keep going like I’ve been going, I have gotten some results and the girlfriend is bound to be found eventually.

1kq9qhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1kq9qhw/weight_loss_with_chronic_illness_and_possibly/,Weight loss with chronic illness and possibly perimenopause,"In the six years since I developed a chronic illness I have noticed the weight slowly creeping up on me. I have a naturally slim build, have always had a fast metabolism despite never having a workout routine out before I got sick, though I did have an active lifestyle, walking everywhere and always being on the go. Pre illness I was around 120lbs at 5’4”, last time I weighed myself I was up to 143lbs. I know it’s not *technically* overweight, but with the illness already causing a lot of identity struggle due to not being able to live the same and do everything I used to, I don’t feel like myself when looking in the mirror, and even with the way I move. I feel like I don’t have the type of build that looks ok with extra weight, and I just feel bloated and bleh. In addition a lot of the weight has settled around my waist, which also makes me wonder if I’m perimenopausal (I’m 42), since I have always been a pear shape with a very small waist. I also have ovarian cysts, so I suppose some of it could be due to bloating. 

Anyway, part of my challenge is that my lifestyle is extremely sedentary now because of my illness, and I can’t work out much at all, and I fear that my metabolism has taken a permanent vacation. I know that if I’m going to be able to lose weight it has to be mainly through diet. I haven’t started counting calories, but comparing my intake to different weight loss menus, I feel like I am not doing that bad, and at least I don’t understand why I keep *gaining* weight. A normal day for me looks like this:

Breakfast: 2 slices of whole grain crisp bread with 2 slices of cheese. 

Lunch: Usually a quinoa salad, often with cucumber, tomatoes, olives and feta, no dressing. 

Dinner: 5/7 days it will be something vegetarian, often with beans or chickpeas. Always homemade, rarely anything particularly heavy or rich. I already eat small portions. Sometimes I’ll skip dinner and have two slices of crisp bread again instead. 

Snacks: 1-2 servings a day of either carrots, banana, handful of nuts and raisins, homemade popcorn made with small amount of olive oil and seasoned with only salt. 

Sweets: I usually get a bun from the bakery on the weekend, but otherwise I have cut out all sweets since Christmas. 

Drink: I know I have a hard time drinking enough water, and I drink way too much Coke Zero. No coffee or tea, and rarely drink alcohol due to my health issues, 1-2 glasses 1-2 times a month tops. 

I know if I eat any less my symptoms start getting worse, but I’m wondering if I could eat better/more beneficially than I currently am? Also, I wonder if I would be able to build back some muscle if it would help my metabolism? Is there a way that I could gently build muscle without a proper workout? I do stretching in the mornings and try to throw in some situps then, and do ten squats and five pushups each time I go to the bathroom. Are there other ways I could sneak in some exercise without doing a full workout?",1,1747655577.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,1.0,False

Yesterday, I got up and drank coffee all morning.  I couldn't have been more worthless.  By eleven am, I think I had 500 ish steps in.  Finally got myself started on the property work I've been doing.  I did go for a one hr. 15 minute walk at about 19 minutes per mile.  Then I really got to work cutting trees (heavy trimming) with a pole saw while using a ladder.  It's dangerous and you better be pretty nimble.   Got cleaned up, went shopping with family and by 7 pm I had in about 20k steps.  

So I popped out another 5k to get my 25k.  Ended up going on an 11:30 walk for another 1500, finished the day at 27,356.  I'm fortunate that the work I do here routinely gives me 10 to 15k steps during a workday.   Otherwise I've got to peck at it and find ways I can walk.

One of the advantage of walking is that as soon as you step outside on the street, you're off and going.   Where there's a will, there's a way.  I do understand why it's hard to let up and take a day off.  Part of me is afraid I won't get started again :).",5,1747655448.0,walking,1,1.0,False

***TL;DR:***  
*Living as at-will tenants in grandparents’ home. They cut our power nightly with a timer, monitor our door with a camera, make unannounced entries into our allocated room, and threaten to lock the fridge if we take food. Treated like teenagers, not adults nor tenants. What are our rights around utilities, privacy, and harassment?*

My sister and I have lived for over two years in a converted section of our grandparents' home. We receive all of our mail here and regularly contribute to groceries and utility bills. There’s no written lease, but based on what I’ve read, we qualify as at-will tenants under Pennsylvania law.

Since moving in, the situation has become increasingly difficult. Our grandfather installed a programmable timer that shuts off electricity to our living area every night. The breaker panel is sealed behind plywood and locked. He also placed a camera pointed directly at our door, saying it’s “to see if you try to break in.”

They frequently enter our room without notice. We’re expected to let them know any time we leave the house, and even visiting other relatives causes tension. We've also been threatened with having the refrigerator chained shut if we take any food without asking.

We’re doing our best to save and move out, but in the meantime, living under constant surveillance, power shutoffs, and control over basic necessities is exhausting. It's beginning to seriously affect our mental and emotional well-being, pretty much at my breaking point. Been through a near-decade long D.A. relationship and I never expected, coming for coffee with my grandmother once a month -> she'd turn out to be nothing but an abuser too. Grandfather does whatever she wants, then what he wants, like what seems to be constructive eviction to his grandkids. Respectful as I can be given how we're treated. Everyday a new insult, a new complaint, questioning where I'm going, complaining about that; dismissing our mental struggles.. sorry. ranting. To the point though:

I’d like to understand:

* Can they legally cut power to the area we occupy as tenants?
* What rights do we have to privacy as at-will tenants?
* Do these actions amount to harassment or constructive eviction?

There’s one issue I’ve tried to bring up with him several times, but it always backfires. He has always been on the chubbier side, which was never a problem for me—I love him for who he is, and his body was never the most important thing.

However, over the past two years, his not so great habits have changed for the worse. He’s started consuming more and more energy drinks, huge amounts of coffee (even though he has high blood pressure and he knowa he shouldn’t), and he buys multiple sweet buns or pastries every single day. I do all the cooking and always try to prepare balanced, healthy meals—but it feels pointless, because he constantly adds on cakes or buns, even right after lunch/dinner.

As a result, he’s gained a substantial amount of weight—probably around 20 kilograms. I want to be clear: I’m not some calorie-counting gym freak. I believe all food is okay in moderation. But this isn’t moderation anymore. He can barely fit into his clothes now, and I’m starting to feel frustrated, especially since he talks about wanting to lose weight. Despite my cooking and my efforts to gently talk about things like energy drinks and sugar, he hasn’t changed anything.

Recently, when we were visiting my parents, he ate about seven pieces of cake at once. That moment really got to me. We’re still young, and I’m worried that his habits are leading him down a dangerous path, health-wise.

Whenever I try to talk to him about it—focusing purely on health, not appearance—his response is always the same: “Oh… I get the feeling you’re not attracted to me anymore.” And, honestly? It’s partly true. I’ve started to feel some resentment. I still love him deeply, but I don’t feel as physically attracted to him as I used to.

I don’t want to break up. But sometimes, I feel like I’m dating a child who can’t make responsible decisions for himself. How can I help him see how serious this is, without hurting him or pushing him further away?",2,1747655125.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False
1kq9le3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreshroastSR800/comments/1kq9le3/preliminary_success_330g_batch_on_the_sr800/,Preliminary Success: 330g batch on the SR800!,"This is one for the ""gee whiz"" archives - I certainly don't expect (nor would I encourage) others to try a 330g batch size. But it's been a ""holy grail"" in my roasting aspirations, and I'm sipping the results of try #1 right now - yowza!

Why 330g? Because (with moisture ""shrinkage"") two rounds of roasting at 330g will get me 7 days worth of roasted coffee (for two people). I used to have a ritual of roasting once a week, and that is an ideal schedule for me. I could easily roast 6 days worth in two \~280g rounds with the SR800 (with mods below)... but upping to 3.5 days was always a nail-biting prospect... but having to roast every 6 days instead of every 7 days was profoundly annoying schedule-wise. Yesterday I decided to finally try it!

MODS:

* BounceBuster tilt base from u/darknight_201
* 3 inch chaff chamber extension (i.e. lifts the lid 1.5 inches higher), homemade
* (not a ""mod"") using factory EXT tube

COFFEE: Rwandan ""Inzovu Supreme"" natural process, 11% moisture content.  

ROAST: Target: City roast. Came out more City+. Final moisture shrinkage was 13.4%

Initial settings Fan 9, Heat 3. And fan 9 DOES move 330g of beans perfectly well in my setup!

On each roast round the bean agitation stopped twice: once in switching from Fan 7 -> 6, and once switching from fan 6 -> 5 (lowest fan setting I used). I had to manually tilt in addition to the BounceBuster to get bean movement going again. Overall roast time 10 minutes per round.

RESULT: Pour-over, \*only 16 hour rest,\* tastes FANTASTIC!

I've struggled a bit with inner bean development to date because I like lighter roasts. I've been consistently getting ""good-enough"" development results, but not ideal. IMO the SR800 runs WAY too hot for light roasts, hence why I was willing to increase batch size -- more beans to soak up the heat!

These beans (judging by hand grinding, which is all I ever do, and taste results) are developed ""close enough."" Maybe not ""perfect,"" but as I dial in the fan/heat switching/timing to avoid bean agitation stalls, I'm sure the inner development should be just about perfect.

NOTES:

The roast is NOT as even as you'd get with more reasonably-sized batch sizes, obviously :)

But - and especially considering the ""stalls"" - it is ""even enough"" for my tastes. I'd much rather do a weeks roasting in two rounds and have a ""really great"" cup of coffee, then to take the time and effort to do three rounds to get a cup that's just a little bit more refined. I just want really good coffee in the morning, dammit :)   

(After a roasting round I DO pick out the quakers and their opposite which I call ""crispers."" Each of the two rounds had 4g (roasted) of rejects. Tossing those the result it a ""pretty even"" roast all things considered.)

I won't post the actual fan/heat settings and timings because in order to save my roasts I had to tilt the roaster in a manner I wouldn't ever advise anyone to do. I WILL keep experimenting and IF I can get a roast control pattern that does NOT require manual tilting I will post THAT if others are interested. Safety first! :)

I do have my roast plan for these beans for the NEXT round that will hopefully avoid bean agitation stalls; but I won't know until I roast next :)

Regardless, I just wanted the sub to know, if you're not trying to dial results in to gnat's ass precision, larger batch sizes are at least POSSIBLE. 

But use caution. YMMV :)

I’m not talking about being creepy or overly forward. I mean just starting a chill conversation and seeing if there's a vibe. But at the same time, I don’t want to be “that guy” who makes someone uncomfortable just trying to grab a coffee.

Do any of you actually do this successfully? Is there a right way to go about it? Or is it basically dead in 2025 unless you're insanely attractive or it’s a rom-com?

Really curious to hear if any of you have made real connections this way or if I should just accept my fate and keep swiping.",10,1747655043.0,AskMenAdvice,64,0.78,False

Hit it off and got her number. We agreed to meet the next day for coffee, but she changed things up and I instead went straight to her place.

While I was there she made a lot of mention about ""if this goes anywhere"" and how I felt about various relationship elements like monogamy. It had been 3 years since she was with a guy and 7 years since I'd been with *anyone*. Her being so open about that made me let my guard down, I've been used by all but one of my sexual partners for sex and then left by the waist side, I told her this very explicitly. But we talked about various stuff for hours until she made her move. We started cuddling and making out until things moved upstairs. The sex was great, super kinky, both of us had fun. She said she wasn't ready for me to spend the whole night, so I drove back home. But I accidentally left my belt in her room, no big deal.

Next day we're chatting and she says she wants to go see Kiki's Delivery Service on Saturday (this is the first picture). I love anime, so obviously I'm down, a normal date would help me figure out what I actually want from all this. Buy the tickets, make plans for sushi afterwards.

But on Thursday she pulls the trigger and says she can't, she got cold feet and completely psyched herself out. Says it was all the ""happy chemicals"" and that she needed to do her own things, that she wasn't ready for a relationship, something I wasn't even sure I wanted either. But I was still pretty hurt by how insanely sudden it was, especially from someone her age, and there being no mention of at least staying friends. The coup de grâce was her saying she would just drop my belt off at my job. When she said that she never said anything about wanting a relationship I decided I would be a bit snarky. And only then did she say we could've been friends.

I took off work the next day so I could screw my head back on straight and talk to friends. I talked to my best bro, my two close gal pals, and my therapist. All of them said that she knew what she was doing and I got totally lead on. My coworkers on the other hand said I completely fumbled it, should've negged her so I could keep hitting it, even though that's not who I am by any stretch of the imagination.

I already have a date lined up with another person for next week, but I feel kinda shitty for what I said to her. She has C-PTSD and in the moment I completely forgot about that.

1kq92wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/systemism/comments/1kq92wn/rise_of_the_tyrant/,Rise of the Tyrant,"**\[Gangseo\]**

Silence lay thick—a suffocating, leaden thing.

*THUD.*

Another body hit the floor with a nauseating finality. The sound echoed off narrow alley walls, bounced down dark streets, and slipped like a knife into the hearts of those still breathing.

And there he stood.  
**The Crew Slayer.**

An immovable monolith in the middle of the massacre.His shadow draped across the blood-soaked pavement, long and dark like death’s cloak.  
Around him: carnage.  
Limbs scattered like broken toys.  
Torsos were shredded wide open, some as if clawed by monsters.  
Others, mercifully, were simply unconscious—though mercy had no place here.

Crimson puddles bled into one another beneath his boots, forming a grotesque mirror of the sky above.

  
He didn’t speak.  
Didn’t gloat.  
Didn’t grin.

His hands stayed tucked into his pockets as if violence were a mundane habit, like lighting a cigarette or checking the time.  
He inhaled deeply, the breath calm, controlled. Barely audible under the soft drip-drip of blood still falling from a ruined wall.

His eyes—*sharp, empty, metallic*—drilled into the two who yet lived, who trembled in a twitching heap before him. They could not stand. Could barely breathe.

They had witnessed the end.

The *reaper* didn’t have a scythe.  
He had hands. And no soul.  
And now, he was the only thing keeping Gangseo silent.

“*Hmm. Not bad.* That was quite the catch,” the Crew Slayer murmured, his voice a velvet scalpel. He paused, tilting his head as he surveyed the aftermath—the crumpled forms on the ground, the tangled mosaic of blood and flesh painted beneath his boots. His eyes flicked down to the two survivors still breathing, barely.

“That was... a lot easier than I expected,” he added, almost disappointed. The ease of destruction tasted stale on his tongue.

He loomed over them momentarily, unmoving—until an idea slithered into his mind.

Without hurry, he reached beneath the folds of his dark trench coat and drew out an axe, heavy, jagged, worn like it had stories to tell. He crouched, slowly, predator still in the final coil before a strike. The edge of the blade caught the light, glinting like a wink from death itself.

His pale, unreadable face lowered until it hovered mere inches from theirs.

“*Knowing that fucker...*” he muttered, voice dropping into icewater, “*he wouldn’t have done this.*”

“W-what?” Jingu gasped, voice trembling, every syllable threaded with panic.

A look—just a look—and Jingu shut up.  
The Crew Slayer’s glare was a blade of its own.

Jingu’s eyes darted away, lips pressed into a fearful line, as if avoiding eye contact might delay the inevitable.

Then the Crew Slayer’s tone shifted—low and serrated.

“Oi,” he growled, menace curling through every syllable,  
“Do you two know who the *One-Man Army* is?”

At the mere *mention* of that name, both Jingu and Changgyu froze.

Their heads snapped toward the Crew Slayer like marionettes yanked by invisible strings. Their eyes widened, pupils shrinking, breath caught in their throats. Colour drained from their faces as if the blood had retreated in terror.

It was like he’d uttered a *forbidden incantation*—a name meant only for nightmares, never to be spoken in the waking world.

Silence clamped down like a vice.

Jingu dropped his gaze, eyes glued to the filth-streaked floor, too afraid to lift them. Changgyu, on the other hand, kept staring—like the Crew Slayer was a ghost he thought long buried.

A dry, guttural scoff escaped the Crew Slayer’s throat.

“So y’all *do* know about him.”  
He rose slowly, axe slung over his shoulder.  
“Good. Because I’m planning to surpass him.”

He took a step closer. His grin didn’t reach his eyes.

“And I’ll need *you fuckers* to help me do it.”  


Jingu’s mouth parted. No sound came out—just breath, ragged and useless.

The Crew Slayer’s stare cut into him. “Got something to say?”

Jingu swallowed, the motion loud in the silence. “W-what if we—”

*THUNK.*

The axe came down in a blur.

It didn’t touch flesh, but the floor cracked where it landed—just *millimetres* from Jingu’s trembling hand.

Both men flinched hard. The shock of the impact rattled their bones. They didn’t dare move.

“J-j-join you…” Jingu whispered, the words barely surviving the tremble in his throat.

His voice was a ghost of itself—fragile, terrified, broken.

The Crew Slayer straightened, calm as death.

With the same eerie grace he’d used to kill, he slid the axe back beneath his coat, its blade disappearing like a secret. From his pocket, he pulled out a crumpled slip of paper and flicked it at their feet.

  
It fluttered down like ash.

  
“Call me,” he said, his voice flat, cold enough to freeze a furnace.

  
Then, without another word, he turned.

His boots echoed softly as he walked away, the trench coat trailing like a shadow in his wake. No urgency. No fear. Just the casual strut of a man who *knows* the city now breathes in his rhythm.

Jingu didn’t move.

He stared at the paper. Stared like it might bite him.

Changgyu’s eyes, wide and haunted, followed the vanishing silhouette—those broad shoulders fading into the ink of the alley, until not even a whisper of him remained.

“W-what are we going to do, boss?” he finally asked, voice as thin and fragile as cracked glass.

Jingu didn’t lift his head.

“W-w-what do you think, Changgyu?” he murmured, barely above a breath. “We lost…”

His hand clenched around the paper.

“This place... Gangseo…”

He paused. Swallowed.

“…It’s not ours anymore.”

The silence crept back in, quiet and final.

**“It’s theirs.”**

**\[Hours Later\]**

As the night faded, taking with it the blood, the noise, the tremors of what had come before, a new day unfolded with deceptive softness.  
The first light of dawn stretched across the horizon, brushing the sky in gold. The chaos of the night now felt like a distant fever dream, chased away by the gentle chirp of birds and the crisp rustling of leaves swaying in the morning breeze.

The city stirred slowly.

Joggers hit the pavement with rhythmic steps. Commuters shuffled toward trains, coffees in hand. Others simply wandered into the day, half-asleep and cradling warm buns from the nearest stall.

At a quiet café tucked on a quiet corner near home, **Song** and **Kim** sat beneath a striped awning, enjoying breakfast in rare, blissful peace. The clatter of cutlery and soft hum of conversation were the only remnants of the waking world. The chaos had not followed them here.

Song leaned forward, brows furrowed, her eyes darting across the menu as if decoding a riddle written in temptation.

“*Unnie*, everything looks so good!” she groaned. “Ahhh, I can’t decide!”

Kim sipped her iced latte, unfazed. “Just pick something already. Don’t worry about the price—Eomeonigave me extra cash before we left.”  
  
“*She did?!*” Song’s face lit up, golden eyes wide with surprise.

Kim grinned, that familiar red-lipped smirk curling at the edges. “Yup. So hurry up. I’m starving.”

Song giggled and turned back to the menu, the morning light dancing across her face as she finally made her choice.

For a moment, just a moment, the world was quiet again.

Meanwhile, as the two sisters placed their breakfast order, **a figure emerged**, cut from darkness like ink spilt across the page of morning.

He strode toward the café, tall and deliberate, wrapped in familiar black: a buttoned shirt, pressed dress pants, and a trench coat that billowed behind him like a shadow trying to catch up. His hair, tousled and unruly, fell into his eyes—eyes that seemed to carry storms, brows knit with a weight no dawn could lift.

His hands were buried deep in his pockets, his steps automatic, as if his body moved but his mind lagged far behind—lost in a fog of memories, thick with the smoke of violence and guilt.

Then, as if summoned by some quiet god of mercy, a butterfly drifted lazily across his path.

It landed on nothing—just hovered, a flicker of fragile grace—and he halted. The world around him seemed to still.

And that’s when he saw them.

**The twins.**

Sitting there, untouched by the horrors he carried. Laughing. Breathing.

**Living.**

His eyes widened. His jaw slackened in stunned silence. For a breathless moment, he simply stared.

Kim looked up, catching the movement from the corner of her eye. Her lips parted, and her laughter faded. Her expression shifted—first to shock, then to something colder. Sharper. Her eyes narrowed, suspicion sparking beneath her lashes like a lit fuse.

https://preview.redd.it/el0pnba81p1f1.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ef468f74dd5e968e4334d9174d6c1228129f54

“What?” he answered curtly, voice clipped like a snapped twig.

“¿Dónde estás?” came the voice on the other end—sharp, urgent.

“Estoy en camino, lo siento,” he replied, eyes narrowing.

“Apúrate, hom—”

He hung up before the word could finish. A long, jagged sigh escaped him. The decision was made.

He turned without another glance and kept walking, his trench coat flaring gently behind him with each step, like the cape of some fallen knight.

From behind the café’s patio railing, Kim’s gaze followed him, studying the sway of that coat, the way his shoulders rolled with quiet weight. Her lips pressed into a thin line.

*""Just what are those two doing here…""* the man muttered under his breath, more to the wind than to anyone who could answer.

At the table, Song had just finished speaking with the waiter. Turning back, she noticed her sister’s stillness.

“Unnie? Is everything alright?” she asked, tilting her head, eyes drifting to follow Kim’s line of sight.

Kim didn’t answer immediately. Her eyes lingered on the fading silhouette in black.

Finally, she murmured, voice barely audible over the clink of silverware and distant birdsong, “Song… I don’t think you saw his face, but for a moment—*for a genuine moment-I* thought that was **crybaby Woo Woo**…”

https://preview.redd.it/ggr92uch1p1f1.png?width=421&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc3b66b7d830e95037bd8ac811a689a684146aa4

Song squinted at the retreating figure, shielding her eyes from the rising sun, before letting out a soft chuckle. “Unnie, don’t be silly. That giant? No way that’s him. Donwoo was a total runt last time we saw him—smaller than both of us. He never had shoulders like *that*.”

Even at a distance, the man’s silhouette cut a powerful figure—broad, firm, and nothing like the crybaby boy they once knew.

Kim exhaled, a short breath laced with old memories and reluctant reason. She closed her eyes for a moment, letting logic sweep away the ghost of hope. Then, she flashed her sister a crooked grin.

“Heh, you’re right. My eyes must be playing tricks on me.”

“Maybe they are,” Song replied, her voice softer now. “Eomeoni said Donwoo’s family moved away years ago. She even lost contact with his mum… no one knows where they went.”

Kim shrugged, a gesture more of surrender than certainty—but before she could say anything more, the waiter arrived, balancing two steaming plates of breakfast bliss. The scent alone broke the mood like sunlight through clouds.

“Yay! Our food’s here!” Song beamed, practically bouncing in her seat.

“God, I’m starving,” Kim laughed, her stomach growling in agreement. “Let’s eat!”

The morning resumed its gentle rhythm, full of clinks, laughter, and the kind of peace that comes before the next storm.

\---

**\[Later, in an abandoned bar\]**

A short while later, two men sat together in an abandoned bar. The place had clearly been untouched for years—dust clung to every surface, but oddly, nothing was broken, nothing stolen. The liquor shelves were fully stocked, as though time had politely stepped aside and let the bar remain intact.

A warm shaft of golden light filtered in through a crack in the boarded-up window, illuminating the slow swirl of dust motes in the air. One of the men lounged lazily at a crooked table, nursing a glass of vodka, his heavy boot propped up casually atop the wood. He looked comfortable, as if chaos suited him. His fingers tapped against the side of the glass in a rhythm only he understood.

Across from him, the other man sat motionless, his back straight, his hands folded on the table. His eyes were hooded, unreadable, his presence as quiet and deadly as a blade sheathed in silk.

Silence hung like thick smoke until the lounging man finally spoke, voice dry with irritation.

“*Me pregunto por qué le está tomando tanto tiempo*,” Hyeonwoo muttered, his tone edged with impatience.

He took a sip from his glass, letting the burn linger in his throat.

Marco smirked, raising his glass in a lazy salute before taking a slow sip of vodka. “*Pacienc—*”

https://preview.redd.it/0pe4peh22p1f1.png?width=544&format=png&auto=webp&s=239c878453d685213693aaee8450527aa18e9af4

**\[Marco\]**  
**\[???\]**

He was abruptly cut off by the creak of the door.

A tall teenager stepped into the dim bar, the light from outside casting a stark silhouette across the dusty floorboards. His steps were unhurried, almost languid, but every stride carried weight, like a war drum in human form. Hands stuffed in the deep pockets of his long coat, he moved with the quiet authority of someone used to rooms falling silent in his presence.

Marco’s smirk widened at the sight of him. “*¿Qué te tomó tanto tiempo? Eres un puto lento,*” he teased, swirling his glass.

Hyeonwoo, by contrast, narrowed his eyes. He didn’t smirk. He watched.

“Shut up,” Donwoo snapped, his voice low, gravelly, dismissive. His gaze swept the room—its crumbling corners, dust-caked bar stools, and bottles standing like ghosts on the shelves. The air reeked of stale alcohol and abandonment. He fit in perfectly.

https://preview.redd.it/j468ijac2p1f1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f3434b803fe15ea07d8f0bb3ab0531cc1f5c843

# [Crew Slayer]

  
Hyeonwoo let out a long, exaggerated sigh, as if Donwoo’s very existence was a chore. He pushed himself up from his chair with a stretch that cracked his spine in three distinct places, then rolled his shoulder with a wince.

“*Un poco más lento,*” he muttered, loud enough to sting. “*Pensamos que una tortuga se apoderaría de la región más rápido que tú.*”

Donwoo’s eyes sharpened. He tilted his head slightly, cracking his neck with a satisfying pop. “Oi,” he growled, his voice low and venom-laced. “You wanna go?”

With a deliberate motion, he swept one side of his trench coat aside. There, strapped to his thigh like a promise, was the familiar gleam of his axe. His fingers twitched near it—itching, daring.

“Keep talking,” he warned, “and I’ll take your good arm.”

Hyeonwoo didn’t flinch.

He scoffed, turning his gaze to his remaining arm and flexing it as if to check if it still had any mileage. “*My other arm?*” he echoed. “I don’t even need my arms to beat your sorry ass.”

He stepped forward, their height almost equal, but the space between them felt like it could collapse into chaos at any moment. “*Hell, if this arm didn’t get ripped off,*” Hyeonwoo continued coolly, “*I’d be whooping your ass daily.*”

Donwoo’s expression darkened—but a smirk curled at the corner of his mouth, like lightning behind thunderclouds.

“Oh, really now?”

“You want to find out?” Hyeonwoo shot back, eyes narrowing, the room suddenly thick with the scent of impending violence.

For a moment, nothing moved.

Then—*clink*—Marco set his glass down and sighed.

“*Por favor,*” he muttered, exasperated. “*Why do you two act like exes fighting over custody every time we meet? Sit down, both of you. We’ve got business.*”

Donwoo’s eyes narrowed, voice dripping with venom. “Shut your trap, you egotistical bastard, and—”

But he never finished the sentence.

Hyeonwoo lunged.

A blur of motion—fast, razor-sharp. His fist lashed out with such speed it cut the air like a whipcrack. Donwoo barely slipped to the side, but not cleanly—a thin line of blood bloomed across his cheek like the stroke of a brush.

He blinked.

So he’s done talking.

Without missing a beat, Donwoo retaliated, his massive fist driving straight into Hyeonwoo’s gut with the force of a freight train wrapped in lightning.

**\[Donwoo Kang has maximised his strength!\]**

**\[Awakening Card – Trigger\]**  
**\[Donwoo Kang Exclusive\]**  
**\[Innate Strength\]**  
**\[The user’s strength rises to ludicrous levels.\]**

**\[Donwoo Kang\]**  
**\[195 cm | 150 kg\]**  
**\[X↑ / LR+ / SS (Awakened) / A+ / MR\]**

The hit landed with a deep, *fleshy* thud. Hyeonwoo's breath left him in a violent cough, his body folding inward like a collapsing bridge. But Donwoo wasn’t done—not by a long shot.

With brutal precision, he launched a left hook that slammed into Hyeonwoo’s jaw, snapping his head to the side. Blood sprayed. Bones groaned. Hyeonwoo staggered, footwork faltering—but he didn’t fall.

He couldn't afford to.

Donwoo surged forward again, so fast he blurred, the floor cracking beneath each step.

“**WHERE’S YOUR BRAVADO NOW, BITCH?!**” he roared, a beast unleashed.

**\[Donwoo is agitated!\]**  
**\[His stats have risen temporarily!\]**

  
**\[Awakening Card – Trigger\]**  
**\[Donwoo Kang Exclusive\]**  
**\[Agitation\]**

**\[Donwoo Kang\]**  
**\[195 cm | 150 kg\]**  
**\[X↑ / X↑ / SS (Awakened) / A+ / MR+↑\]**

Hyeonwoo gritted his teeth, the taste of blood thick on his tongue. With a quick push kick, he forced Donwoo back a step, barely a second of breathing room.

But that was all he needed.

He spun backwards, one foot planting against the wall behind him—then he launched. Like a spring uncoiling, he twisted mid-air, bringing down a savage axe kick straight onto Donwoo’s raised forearms. The impact echoed like thunder in the hollow bar.

Donwoo punched upward, but Hyeonwoo parried with the heel of his boot mid-air—*BAM!*—and followed with a vicious left hook that clocked Donwoo clean across the face.

The brute stumbled back, cheek red and swelling, but still upright—still unshaken.

Hyeonwoo lowered his stance, guard up, chest heaving. Donwoo spat a wad of blood onto the dusty floor and rolled his neck, a dangerous calm falling over him.

""You bragged earlier,"" Donwoo growled, wiping the blood from his lips, “about not needing your arms…”

*SWIP. TAK. BAM.*

Hyeonwoo unleashed a flurry of low, swift kicks—light, precise, almost teasing.

Donwoo didn’t move.

But his gaze sharpened.

There was something in Hyeonwoo’s eyes—not arrogance, not desperation—but calculation.

“…Are my legs considered my arms?”

“…”

Donwoo didn’t answer.

He didn’t need to.

His body tensed, muscles coiling like steel cables under his skin.

**\[Donwoo Kang is charging his final blow!\]**  
**\[His fist is coursing with terrifying power…\]**

Donwoo stepped forward, trench coat flaring like a banner of war.

“Let’s not waste any more time,” he muttered, his voice low, almost sad.

“Let’s not waste any more time,” he muttered, his voice low, almost sad. With a sudden surge of power, Donwoo delivered a swift front kick to Hyeonwoo’s chest. The impact forced a gasp of pain from Hyeonwoo, who barely had time to react, let alone block the blow. Remaining unfazed, Donwoo’s eyes locked on Hyeonwoo as he prepared to deliver the final blow.

**“So long.”**

His fist drew back, gleaming, trembling with restrained destruction.

**\[Final Hit Incoming.\]**

https://preview.redd.it/d72dglni3p1f1.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4dd06c54c919b165fb65241a526dbc71e9ba335

But just as Donwoo’s charged fist began its deadly arc—

**CLAP.**

A single, deliberate clap rang out through the dusty stillness.

**CLAP.**

Another. Slow, mocking. Like a judge preparing a verdict.

**CLAP.**

https://preview.redd.it/2efqarqk3p1f1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e719f2e8ffb37cca8013187f4b395fabcf4f23f

“**Ahora, ahora...**”The voice was casual—almost bored.

Both Donwoo and Hyeonwoo froze.

In the blink of an eye, they felt it—**a vice grip**, ice-cold and unshakable, clutching their wrists. No time to react. No space to resist. Just that sudden *awareness* that they’d crossed a line... and someone had drawn it back.

Marco’s face was the picture of serenity. Not a wrinkle of strain. Not a flicker of emotion. Just those calm, unreadable eyes.

Then—**CRACK!**

With a movement so fast it barely registered, Marco hurled both boys upward like they were nothing but coats on a hook. Their bodies flew through the air, stunned and weightless, eyes wide with disbelief.

Time slowed.

And then—**BOOM!**

**Both of Marco’s palms slammed into their chests mid-air**, the impact a *sonic war drum* that shook the entire bar.

https://preview.redd.it/8st9rbin3p1f1.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=047f2975d33e1acc1d540f6547f08f6494a9ca75

**The Earth cracked.**

Donwoo and Hyeonwoo slammed into the ground like meteorites, the floor giving way beneath them. Craters formed, tiles erupting outward like shrapnel. The air was filled with dust, debris, and the ringing echo of *pain*.

For a moment, all was still.

Then—*coughing*. Violent, raw.

Spit mixed with blood dripped from their mouths as they lay there, motionless, barely conscious.

**\[Donwoo Kang vs Hyeonwoo Lee\]**  
**\[Status: Defeated by ""Marco""\]**

Marco exhaled slowly, brushing dust from his sleeves like he’d just swatted a pair of flies.

**“Sin peleas,”** he murmured. Calm. Unbothered. Deadly.

He glanced down at the crumpled figures sprawled across the ruined floor. A smirk tugged at the edge of his lips.

**“¿Están inconscientes? Qué extraño… apenas usé fuerza.”**

Marco slid his hands into his pockets with lazy grace and returned to his seat. He poured the last of the vodka, swirling it gently as the dust finally settled around him like ash.

He took a sip, eyes distant, voice barely a whisper—

**“Children.”**

The boys groaned as they staggered upright, limbs trembling, breath ragged.

Their eyes, still clouded with pain and disbelief, locked on Marco.

“You…” they growled in unison, rage leaking from their voices.

Marco didn’t flinch. He simply gave a lazy, one-handed wave, like shooing away smoke. “**Hay cosas más importantes.**” *(There are more pressing matters.)*

He yawned.

As if on cue, the sound of boots echoed from the hallway. Shadows spilt into the bar as a group began to file in—silent, solemn, eyes unreadable.

Donwoo cracked a grin. “Ah… looks like **my crew’s here\~**”

Without missing a beat, he wrapped his massive arms around two of the newcomers.

**Jingu.**

**Changgyu.**

Both men turned pale. The blood drained from their faces.

**How?**

Jingu’s voice was barely a whisper. “Th-That’s not possible…”

Changgyu took a step back. “Y-You were dead.”

The bar, once filled with dust and tension, now pulsed with something colder. Heavier. Unspoken.

**How… is someone who died… alive?**

Hyeonwoo let out a dry chuckle. He strolled over to an old wooden stool and dropped into it like a man watching a car crash he saw coming.

“You’re better off not knowing,” he muttered, eyes never leaving Donwoo’s form.

His tone held no humour now—just grim understanding.

And a **warning**.

Donwoo met his stare. He said nothing.

But the way the lights flickered?

The way the room suddenly felt two degrees colder?

That said, everything.

**The inevitable had arrived.**

There would be no vote. No speeches. No mercy.

**Only one could be king.**

And though Hyeonwoo might’ve resisted, deep down, he knew.

He lacked something Donwoo had seized—not by virtue, not by charm— but by **sheer, bone-rattling terror.**

**Fear** could fill a throne room faster than love ever could.

And now, Donwoo had it.

There was nothing left to say. No ground left to argue. No high horse to sit on.

Only silence.

“I’ll take the position of King,” Donwoo said at last, his tone slick with snark—but underneath, a thread of irritation coiled tight. His subordinates’ trembling didn’t please him. Not entirely.

They feared him.

But did they *respect* him?

With a slow, bitter nod, Hyeonwoo finally grumbled out his resignation.

The crown had passed.

“**Bueno.**” Marco smiled faintly from his chair, swirling the last drops of vodka. “**No querría tener que golpearlos otra vez.**” (*Wouldn’t want to beat you all up again.*)

He chuckled, low and lazy.

Like a lion who’d already eaten.

The dust began to settle.

But far above them—somewhere deep in the city's lungs— **Storms were forming.**

Because if one man took the crown through fear… **Someone else would surely come to take it with fire.**

I think a lot of us do this kinda thing, right? It’s like our brains get tricked into thinking that small tasks are way bigger than they are. There's actually a name for it: the 'Zeigarnik Effect'. I read somewhere that we tend to remember uncompleted tasks better, making them loom larger in our heads. Plus, anything slightly annoying gets bumped down the list. Our brains prioritize stuff that feels urgent or interesting, so these little things... just keep on slipping.

Maybe I should make a deal with myself: attack the pile during coffee time! 😂 But why do we all do this? Is it really just about our brains being lazy, or is there more to it? Let me know how you guys deal with this stuff!",5,1747653318.0,WhyWeAct,0,1.0,False

With nice weather, we do this in the park like a picnic. We interchange between one longer book and one shorter (or very fast-read) book. Our pace is 10 pages per day, so very doable. 

I was wondering if there are more people who are interested in this concept and want to participate. Let me know, and if you have questions, leave a comment. 
Cheers! 

Edit: the meetings are always in the weekends or rarely on Fridays. But their arrangement depends on the book. As mentioned before, 10 pages/day rule means sometimes we have one meeting per month and something more or less often. ",3,1747653310.0,Nijmegen,10,0.8,False

But about two weeks into dating, I found out he was still legally married. He told me they had been separated for 6 months and that the divorce was just a ""formality."" He promised to start the paperwork by the end of the month. Well, it’s now been 4 months, and nothing has changed. According to him, his wife is refusing to accept the divorce, even though she was the one who cheated on him (twice) and originally asked for it.

She calls him 6–10 times a day (begging him to reconsider), texts him constantly—including at night—and this happens every single day. I’ve asked him a few times to set some boundaries: block her number, only respond to messages related to the divorce, and remove the heart emoji from her name in Messenger. He refuses, saying he “doesn’t want to be mean to her.”

For context, in our country, being legally married comes with a lot of restrictions. We can’t apply for a mortgage together or co-own property while he's still married, so it’s not just a symbolic issue.

At the same time, he’s incredibly sweet, empathetic —which is a big reason why I like him, and claims he want to be with me. But this situation is driving me crazy.

A few days ago, we got into a heated argument about this divorce. I mentioned that I had blocked some of my exes after we broke up—not because anything bad happened, but because I just didn’t want to see them on social media anymore and stuff like that. With some, I still occasionally grab coffee or chat, so to me, blocking isn’t toxic—it’s just how I move on.

He, however, called me cold-blooded, rude, and cynical for doing that. And yet his divorce is still a sensitive, off-limits topic. It feels like my feelings don’t matter because he’s more focused on not hurting her.

Also, she has no idea he’s in a new relationship. I can’t tell if this should be a dealbreaker, or if I’m overreacting.

1kq90zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutsourceDevHub/comments/1kq90zu/top_5_tips_how_computer_vision_image_processing/,Top 5 Tips: How Computer Vision & Image Processing Solutions Boost Your Outsourced Dev Success,"**Top 5 Tips: How Computer Vision & Image Processing Solutions Boost Your Outsourced Dev Success**

Imagine giving your application “eyes” that can spot a coffee spill on the office floor or count the number of cars in a parking lot before you even arrive. That’s the magic of computer vision (CV) and image processing (IP) solutions—turning raw pixels into powerful insights. Whether you’re a dev looking to sharpen your CV chops or a business owner hunting for an outsourced partner, you’ve probably Googled queries like “best computer vision libraries Python,” “image processing ROI,” or “outsourced CV developer rates.” Let’s dive into what those searches tell us and how you can leverage that intel to build killer CV/IP solutions.

Developers often type search terms such as “OpenCV tutorial regex filename filter” or “TensorFlow object detection API example.” Business owners, on the other hand, lean toward “computer vision outsourcing cost,” “image processing use cases in retail,” and “CV solutions for quality control.” These dual perspectives shape the market: deep-dive tutorials for engineers, outcome-focused case studies for stakeholders. Understanding both sides of the keyword coin helps you craft a CV project that’s technically robust and commercially viable.

**Tip #1 (Data Matters)**: Google searches for “image preprocessing steps” and “how to clean training images” spike when teams hit low accuracy. It’s no surprise—garbage in, garbage out. Before you even write a single line of code, invest in good data: clean up skewed angles, remove duplicate frames, and normalize illumination. A simple regex like `^img_\d{4}\.jpg$` can automate filename validation, ensuring your pipeline only ingests well-formed inputs. Think of data prep as the secret sauce that separates “meh” models from must-have features.

**Tip #2 (Library Leverage)**: Instead of reinventing the wheel, hitch your wagon to established libraries. Searches for “scikit-image vs. OpenCV speed” and “best C++ image processing library” reflect a common developer dilemma: speed versus flexibility. Abto Software engineers often choose OpenCV for rapid prototyping, then switch to optimized C++ modules or GPU-accelerated CUDA kernels in production. Using well-documented APIs slashes dev time—just don’t forget to pin your dependencies in `requirements.txt` or your next sprint might crash harder than a 404.

**Tip #3 (Modular Pipelines)**: Queries like “how to build CV microservices” and “image processing REST API design” have surged as teams embrace cloud-native architectures. Break your CV solution into discrete stages—preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, post-processing—and wrap each in its own microservice. This approach lets you scale the parts that need heavy GPU horsepower independently from lightweight tasks like result formatting. Plus, if one stage tanks, you can roll back without rebuilding the entire pipeline.

**Tip #4 (Accuracy vs. Speed)**: You’ve undoubtedly Googled “real-time object detection” and “batch image processing.” Here’s the catch: real-time is resource-hungry, batch is a scheduling dream. At Abto Software, we’ve seen clients get burned by chasing millisecond-level latency for every frame—only to discover they really needed throughput for nightly reports. Define your service-level objectives (SLOs) first. If “under 100 ms per inference” is a hard must-have, budget for edge GPUs or FPGA acceleration. If not, batch ops on a CPU cluster might cut your cloud bill in half.

**Tip #5 (Scalability & Maintainability)**: Businesses searching “outsourced CV team management” want confidence their project won’t go sideways as usage grows. Containerize with Docker, orchestrate with Kubernetes, and version your models in an ML registry. Use semantic versioning (`v1.2.3`) and clear changelogs so your ops team isn’t chasing mystery bugs after a midnight deploy. And remember: a model that works well on 1,000 images may choke on 1,000,000. Build load tests into your CI/CD pipeline—otherwise you’re flying blind.

Of course, no article on CV/IP would be complete without a nod to emerging trends. You’ve likely searched “vision transformers vs. CNNs” or “self-supervised learning image.” Transformers are hot, but CNNs still rule video analytics, and unsupervised pretraining can save you thousands of labeled images. Keep an eye on hybrid models that fuse classical image processing (edge detection, morphological ops) with deep nets for the best of both worlds.

Now, for the fun part: triggering your inner skeptic. If you’re outsourcing your next CV project, beware the “we do deep learning for $5 an hour” pitch. Cheap labor with no CV chops is like handing a toddler a scalpel—results are unpredictable and probably messy. Instead, look for providers who can explain their pipeline in plain English, justify why they choose thresholding over clustering in a given stage, and show you real performance metrics. That’s the kind of partner that can turn an “experimental feature” into a revenue generator.

Finally, whether you’re coding in Python, C#, or Go, keep one thing in mind: CV/IP isn’t rocket science—well, sometimes it literally is (think satellite imagery). But with the right blend of data hygiene, proven libraries, modular design, and a realistic balance of speed and accuracy, you can deliver solutions that make users go “Oh, snap—that’s cool.” And if you need a hand building out your next computer vision pipeline, remember that firms like Abto Software live and breathe IP/CV projects. They’ve been there, debugged that, and can help you avoid the most common pitfalls.

So, go ahead: sharpen your regex, tweak your CNN hyperparameters, and ask the right questions when outsourcing. Your next computer vision project could be the one that finally gives your application “sight”—and a serious competitive edge.",1,1747653137.0,OutsourceDevHub,0,1.0,False

It's all ""I love hiking,"" ""big foodie,"" ""swipe right for a dog pic,"" etc., etc. But then I stumbled upon this guy whose bio had a single line about loving 'The Bots Master.' 😂

Honestly, I haven't thought about that beyond-weird 90s cartoon in... well, probably since the 90s! Something about robots, laser eyes, and catchy theme songs really did it for me back then, I guess. So, naturally, I had to swipe right and drop him a ""ZOOM into my BONK!"" reference, cause if ya know, ya know!

He responded with another classic line from the show, and we ended up chatting for ages about all our fave forgotten cartoons. We bonded over characters and plot lines no one in their right mind would remember. It's wild how one obscure interest can create the best kind of connection, right?

Anyway, we decided to meet up for coffee, intending to gush about even more 90s nostalgia in person. Whether or not this led to romance, our shared enthusiasm brought some serious joy into my day. And hey, isn't that kinda what it's all about? 🥰",1,1747653067.0,OnlineDatingStory,0,1.0,False

The kid, with the *most serious* face ever, is saying something like, ""Max, you have to be brave and not bark at the shadows!"" Meanwhile, Max, the puppy, is just wagging his tail, more interested in chasing his own tail than taking commands. 

I couldn't help but giggle a bit, and the boy notices. He goes, ""Sometimes he gets scared of the little things. Do you have a brave dog too?"" 

I played along and said, ""Well, my pup thinks he's a knight, but shadows are his nemesis too!"" 

We shared this knowing grin, like we'd both cracked the code of puppy bravery. It's that kinda unexpected, sweet moment that just makes you smile. 😊 

Do you guys have any similar stories of kids and their pets being unexpectedly perfect together? Would love to hear them! ✨",5,1747652823.0,FlirtEncounters,0,1.0,False

 Well my dad asked me to get his med which now came in little while bags but I wasnt sure if their right so I asked if their correct and he started clapping and mocking me like I was stupid, my dad then asked me if I could make him a coffee but I at that point just wanted to go back to my room but my dad basiclly said he didnt care and asked to make me a coffee so I snaped and snatched his meds throughing everything back into where they go ingnoring his calls and locked myself in my room.

1kq8u3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmexUK/comments/1kq8u3d/458_cashback_earned_as_a_new_home_owner/,£458 cashback earned as a new home owner,"Hi thought I would share how advantageous the Amex cashback card has been for me this last year as a new homeowner. Some self promotion I suppose but also encouragement if the below circumstances apply to any of you. 


I bought my first home last year and applied for the Amex cashback card via TopCashback before moving in. This meant I was able to earn back the £25 annual fee.

There was also a promotion of  £125 cashback for new cardmembers who spent £3,000 in the first three months. This was very easy to achieve in my circumstances as I was gearing up to buy a fridge, freezer, TV, microwave, kettle, toaster, sofa, coffee machine etc.... Etc..... Etc... Everything you need for a new house. 

I put all my regular spend on my card and made 1 referral during the year. In the end I earned a very pleasing £458 in cashback for next to zero effort. 

I'm with Octopus Energy so was also able to pay all my bills with Amex. A bit weird that I looked forward to paying big bills knowing I was racking up cashback lol. 

I have now downgraded to free Cashback everyday card. I don't think the Cashback card is now worth it as you're only really earning £75 on 10k spend (net of £50 after the annual fee) and I don't anticipate I will be splashing my cash as much this year at all.

To anyone who has a milestone moment in your life be it new house, new vehicle, wedding purchases or anything significant the cashback card is definitely worth it. 

I have now applied for the Gold card as its free for the first year. I'm not eligible for the sign up points bonus as an existing cardholder but I want to test out how useful points would be for me. Doubt I will accumulate many points considering I'll be a bit more conservative with my spend this year but waiting 2 years to be eligible for a sign up bonus seems an awful long time... I contacted CS and they mentioned that existing members can benefit from ad hoc promotions from time to time, so will see if I'm lucky to benefit from any during my membership year. A shame existing customers don't get much but hey ho. ",10,1747652472.0,AmexUK,6,1.0,False

1kq8r7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1kq8r7j/what_detox_tea_do_my_unfiltered_experience_using/,What detox tea do? My unfiltered experience using Lulutox Detox Tea for 6 weeks,"I’ve always had a weird relationship with “detox” anything. The word gets tossed around so much that it’s hard to know what’s real and what’s just overpriced tea bags and marketing fluff. So when I started seeing posts about **Lulutox detox tea**, I didn’t exactly jump in head first. I did what most people do - I read through threads, stalked reviews, and eventually decided to try it myself for six weeks straight.

If you’ve been wondering *what detox tea do* or if **Lulutox tea** is actually worth the hype, I’ll break down what changed for me and what didn’t. This isn’t a sales pitch. It’s just a regular person’s experience.

**Why I Tried Lulutox Detox Tea**

For context, I wasn’t trying to drop 20 pounds overnight. I just wanted to feel less bloated, get my energy levels up, and maybe tone up a bit without relying on caffeine or supplements. I work from home, sit way too much, and even on “clean eating” weeks I still feel kind of heavy and slow.

What got my attention was how many people said **Lulutox tea** helped them with energy and digestion without being harsh or causing side effects. That’s when I decided to test it myself.

**What’s In Lulutox Tea and What’s It Supposed to Do?**

A big part of why I gave **Lulutox detox tea** a chance was the ingredients list. It didn’t look like a random mix of herbs with a fancy label - it had real stuff in it that I’d actually heard of.

The **Lulutox tea ingredients** include:

* **Matcha Green Tea & Oolong** – known for metabolism and fat-burning support
* **Yerba Mate & Guarana** – smooth energy, less crash
* **Sencha Green Tea** – antioxidant-rich
* **Dandelion Leaf & Milk Thistle** – used for liver and digestion support
* **Ginseng, Goji Berries, Nettle Leaf, Lemongrass** – anti-inflammatory, gut-calming
* **Stevia Leaf** – adds sweetness with zero sugar or calories

It’s vegan, gluten-free, soy-free, and doesn’t use artificial sweeteners or junk ingredients. Each tea bag has about 18mg of caffeine, which is way less than coffee but enough to keep me awake.

**What Detox Tea Do (Based on My Actual Experience)**

**Week 1–2:**  
I didn’t expect much, but by day 5 or 6, I noticed I wasn’t feeling as bloated. After meals, my stomach felt more comfortable. I didn’t look five months pregnant by 7 PM anymore. That was a win.

**Week 3–4:**  
This is where I felt the biggest shift. My **energy was more steady**, I wasn’t crashing in the afternoon, and I didn’t need my second coffee. I also noticed I wasn’t snacking as much. Something about drinking the tea midday kept my cravings in check.

**Week 5–6:**  
At the end of six weeks, I had lost about 4.3 pounds. Not dramatic, but noticeable. My jeans fit better, and my stomach felt flatter. I didn’t make major diet changes, just stayed consistent with walking, light meals, and one cup of **Lulutox tea** each day.

**Side Effects? Not Really**

If you’re looking into **Lulutox detox tea side effects**, here’s my honest take: I didn’t have any. No cramping, no urgent bathroom runs, no jitteriness. It felt more like gentle support than a forced cleanse. That said, I did notice I needed to drink more water. It’s tea, after all, and if you don’t hydrate, you might feel a little dry.

So yes, I’d say **is Lulutox tea safe** \- for me it absolutely was. But if you’re on medication or dealing with something medical, talk to your doctor first.

**Where to Buy It (Avoid the Fakes)**

There are copycat versions floating around online. I ordered directly from the [**official Lulutox site**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) where I saw the 70% discount. Delivery was fast and the product matched what I expected.

I also bookmarked this [**alternate link**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) in case the original page goes down. Same offer.

**Final Thoughts: What Detox Tea Do (for Real)**

So... *what detox tea do*? In my experience, the good ones like **Lulutox detox tea** don’t shock your system or make you lose water weight overnight. They support your body gently, helping you digest better, reduce inflammation, stay regular, and feel lighter over time.

**Lulutox tea** didn’t perform miracles, but it made a real difference. I felt better, more in control of my cravings, and just more balanced overall. And for me, that’s worth continuing.

Curious if anyone else has tried it. What was your **Lulutox tea review** like? Did you notice different results or run into any **Lulutox detox tea side effects**? Let’s compare.",1,1747652189.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

Two weeks before I was meant to become the bride of a stranger, I agreed to marry a dying man. 

Not for love. Not for mercy. 

But because Alina and Creed, my private bodyguard and lover were fucking behind my back–and I don’t believe in forgiveness. Only strategy. 

Alina, the illegitimate daughter my father paraded around like a prized lamb, was supposed to marry the Colombo heir, Zacharias Colombo. It was her crown, her alliance, her throne. Until the car went under, until he fell into **a** coma -and she ran like a coward. Said she wouldn’t “tie herself to a corpse.” 

She abandoned the empire like it was a bad purse. And my father–spineless, shivering behind his legacy–begged me to take her place. I said no. Laughed. Poured wine and let it spill like venom across his desk. Again and again. Until I realized something: 

If I want to burn them, I need the match. 

If I want revenge, I need power. 

And the Colombos? They’re bleeding. 

So I said yes. 

I’ll marry the breathing carcass she left behind. I’ll wear her dress. I’ll take her throne. And when I’m done building my empire, I’ll ruin her. 

Let Alina watch me wear the crown she threw away–and choke on every jewel. 

“I’ve made my decision now. I’ll marry the comatose heir of the Colombo family.” 

品 

\-Father looked up. The cigar fell from his mouth like a man overboard. 

“You’ll what?” His voice was soft. Soft like the moment before a noose tightens. 

“You heard me,” I replied/ stepping into the room. Each click of my heels on marble was a warning shot. “The Colombo boy. The one with a heartbeat and nothing else. The one who drools in his hospital bed while his family scrambles to keep their empire intact. That one.” 

Father’s eyes narrowed. Then, unbelievably, his lips curled into something resembling pride. 

“Scarlett, sweetheart, this is… unexpected. The Colombos have been circling

like vultures, and the wedding’s in two weeks. I’ll have Madison bring in designers from Milan. Black, right? Something dramatic?” 

“That’s it?” I tilted my head. “I’m sacrificing myself to marry a man in a coma–a man who was Alina’s fiancé to begin with. She was the one who was supposed to walk down that aisle. But the moment things got hard, that unhinged, gold–digging coward ran. And now I’m the one saving your criminal empire. Not bonus? No thank you? Not even a damn crown?” 

His jaw locked. The air grew heavy–thick with unspoken threats and old, rotting truths. 

“Watch your mouth,” he growled. “She’s your sister.” 

“No,” I snapped, my voice like frostbite. “A sister is someone born of the same. woman. That girl is the stain on Mom’s coffin.” 

His face twitched–just a flicker of guilt, gone before it could bloom. 

We never spoke of it. Not really. But we both knew the truth. My mother didn’t die of illness. She died of heartbreak–watching the man she loved parade his mistress through our home, then force us to play happy family with the bastard child who came after. 

Alina. 

The daughter he loved more than me. The one who got the smiles, the attention, the mercy. While I got trained like a soldier and starved for affection. I was born with fire in my lungs. She was born with his hand around her 

shoulder. 

And somehow, I was the one who kept bleeding for this family. 

“What do you want?” he asked finally. 

“One hundred million wired to my account after the wedding. And I want Vincent Creed reassigned–to her.” 

He blinked. Once. Twice. “Creed? Your personal guard?” 

I shrugged. “People change. I don’t want him anymore.” 

He didn’t believe me–not fully. But he didn’t press. After a moment, he nodded. “Fine. The money transfers when the marriage is legal. Creed goes 

with her. Done**.** 

I turned to leave, but his voice caught me like a hook in the ribs. 

“Scarlett…” he said, quieter now**,** almost human. “Creed was the only man you ever cared about. You sure about this?”

handle. My chest tightened. Just for a breath. 

Then I exhaled the ache and steeled myself. 

“He made his choice,” I said. “Now I’m making mine.” 

I don’t want Creed anymore, 

Not after I found him with her–with Alina–naked and breathless on my sheets, in my room, where I used to dream about a life that could’ve been ours. The man I trusted, the one who used to trace the scars on my back and kiss every one like a vow, now tangled in the arms of the girl who destroyed everything she touched. 

He was never just a guard to me. He was mine–in secret, in stolen nights, in the hidden corners of a world that would never let us be together. For a year, we existed like a whisper between wars. He knew my real laugh, not the one I weaponized. He knew how I liked my coffee. He knew how to hold me when my father’s coldness cracked me open. And I let him see me–every broken, bruised, vicious part. 

I loved him in a way that made me feel human. Whole. Safe. 

And then Alina came back from Europe. 

She waltzed into the estate with her designer bags, sun–kissed skin, and that glittering little smirk that always meant ruin. Everything shifted after that. Creed grew distant. Guarded. He started taking shifts he never used to take- ones that meant he was near her. And I–I made excuses. For him. For her. For the silence that grew like mold between us. 

Until the day I came home early. 

Until I opened my bedroom door and saw the man I loved inside her. 

No one could scream that kind of betrayal. It sinks too deep. It guts too clean. I stood frozen in the doorway, eyes locked on the bed, on the betrayal, on his back as it curved toward her like instinct. I didn’t cry until later–when they were gone and the room still stank of them. 

That night, I fell apart. Not like a girl. Like a weapon dropped too hard on stone. 

I screamed into my pillows, sobbed until my lungs turned inside out. Because I didn’t just lose him. I lost the one good thing I thought I had. The one man who looked at me like I wasn’t just another soldier in my father’s war. 

But the numbness came. Slowly. Like winter crawling under a door. And when it settled, it made things clear. 

Chapter 1 

**May** 

85%會 

Alina always took what was mine. Always. 

Friends. Dresses. Teachers‘ praise. Father’s approval. Even the final thread of sanity holding my mother’s soul together. She watched our mother spiral into grief after becoming the “other woman” in her own home, and she never once. looked guilty. She was the golden child, the chosen one, the girl everyone loved because she played soft and sweet while I burned too bright. 

And now, Creed. 

Even he wasn’t strong enough to resist her gravity.

However, no surprises that my ferritin is on the lower end of 'normal' at 39. I want to try to get it to 50, or at least to the 40s. I've had many iron tests over the years and 39 is actually my highest so that's good! The supplements must be doing something, but even so I know I'm still struggling with absorption. I guess I'm just trying to understand what my target should be as someone TTC, especially as someone who struggles to increase their iron levels.

 I'm not vegan or vego but I don't eat a whole lot of meat. I would say my diet is high-ish in non-heme iron, but low in heme-iron compared to the meat eating population, but I still eat meat on average twice a week. I take a ferritin supplement and my prenatal has a large dose of iron in it too. I suspect my coffee and milk intake may be affecting my ability to absorb iron too (due to tannins and calcium). I wouldn't qualify for an infusion as my levels aren't low enough. Do I just need to start eating more liver steak for a short while? ",2,1747651856.0,TryingForABaby,1,1.0,False

1kq8m6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kq8m6h/moving_on/,Moving on,"I am a 33 year old male. My relationship ended abruptly, and what felt like “out of the blue” for the most part for me, in December. I learned in March that she was cheating on me. 

I am working out, trying to eat right and getting back into shape, but I’m struggling. I don’t want her back, but I miss the connection and the wholeness I experienced with her, but now I feel alone. I’m a guy. I feel like most guys only date a women, for a significant amount of time, once every few years…. It was closer to 8 for me. I was single for 8 years, involuntarily just endless rejections, ghosting/via not following up, and a few straight up nos. Frankly, I don’t trust them anymore for the most part and I don’t care to pursue or even try. 

I go to coffee shops alone, I go to dinner alone, I work out alone, I spend most of the holidays and my birthday with my mom and dad, but for the most part I feel completely alone even when I’m with them. Going to church makes me feel alone, seeing everyone (now appearing younger than me) not only married but kids that are a few years old. 

I don’t know what I’m doing. I just feel like I’m not good enough, I’m not lovable, and that I will die alone becuase I don’t meet the conventional standards of women nowadays. 
It scares me that I’m becoming more and more ok with that as I slowly withdrawal from dating women all together, because what is accompanying it is total and utter apathy. Why have a home? Why have a car? Why keep my good job? Why do anything I’m doing? A man’s purpose is to provide, I have no one who wants what I offer. Then why do I struggle to have things to offer people that no one wants? 

I’m just going through the motions.

1kq8gto,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1kq8gto/airline_messed_up/,Airline messed up,"As a Night Auditor (F23)  I love Sunday and Monday nights because it’s the only time where the hotel is peaceful..until today. 

I came in with the beautiful sight of an empty parking lot and barely any check ins..my favorite type of shift. 
I did my normal routine of running audit and doing reports and made some coffee for the guests.
Around 3am I got a call from an airline telling me that a plane was delayed until the afternoon and were wondering if I had a room available for customers to sleep in until this afternoon. 
I said yes I had room and gave them our rate and I said we had shuttle services but our shuttle doesn’t start till 4am but there’s taxi service at the airport.

Apparently the airline didn’t listen so I had the phone ringing off the hook asking for the shuttle and I had to tell the passengers that the shuttle doesn’t start till 4 and they were all understanding of that and got their own ride here. 
This is where the passengers got upset. 
The voucher the airline gave them was not valid due to the date on the voucher. 
*Check in 18th and check out the 19th*
Today is the 19th and I ran audit hours ago before they even called, so the voucher was invalid due to this. 
I explained to the passengers that because of this mistake I can’t honor the voucher because it says the check in the 18th instead of the 19th like how can I honor a voucher dated for YESTERDAY! 
I gave them the option to either call the airline to fix their mistake or I can give the distressed passenger rate of $83 plus tax but they would have to pay for it. 

They were tired and decided to take the distressed passenger rate and they were understanding of the situation which I appreciate. 
It’s not every day we get passengers who don’t yell and cuss you out over a mistake an airline made that you can’t fix. 
..I spoke too soon when I thought of that. 

I was on the very last passengers from the plane and was finishing up with one of the passengers when these three other POS came in. 
To help me out so I don’t have to constantly explain to every single person who came in from the flight the other passengers were kind enough explain the situation to the passengers who were coming in so they knew what was wrong and what their options were and when the 3 people from the flight came in that’s when the yelling and cussing came in. 

Guy 1: “So what’s your discount then?” 

Me: “The distressed passenger rate is $83 plus tax.” 

Guy 1: *laughs* “You call that a discount?! What’s your full price?” 

Me: “King is $154 plus tax and two queens is $164 plus tax.”

*Wym that’s not a good discount bro?* 

There was an another lady who chimed in and she comments saying that I should honor the voucher because we work for the airport so I made sure everyone in this lobby heard this.

Me: “I DONT work for the airport. The voucher is invalid because of the check in dates. No one from your flight showed up on my arrivals so not only is your voucher invalid but your reservation doesn’t even exist.” 

Woman: “That’s bullshit!” 

It’s was 5am at this time and they wanted to go back to the airport. 
Before I sent my shuttle driver to take them I told him that they are really mad and gave him a short explanation of what’s going on and when he got back he definitely had a few things to say.

During the drive back to the airport the woman was going off saying how disrespectful I was for not honoring the invalid voucher to which my driver told her exactly what I said. 
Can’t honor a voucher that was dated for yesterday 🤷‍♀️. 
Obviously this made her more mad to which she replied.
“Well that sounds like bullshit to me! That’s YOUR hotel’s problem!”
He stopped the van btw they didn’t even make it out to the parking lot yet. 

“No, it’s the AIRLINE problem. We’re very sorry your airline didn’t put the correct date for your voucher and were told it was invalid but that is the AIRLINE’S FAULT! Not the hotel’s.” 

There’s gonna be that one person who’s like “Can’t you just take it anyway?” No I can’t. 
How the fuck am I gonna take a voucher that was dated for yesterday and check in a reservation that doesn’t exist? 

After 20 mins I got back to back calls from both the airline and airport asking me why didn’t I just let them in. 
I’m being for real that the guy at the airport was telling me to let them in regardless if it’s valid or not. 
I had enough and said I’m not taking any more passengers or those passengers who came from my hotel due to their behavior. 

Dear airline,
FIX YOUR SHIT! 

-Love a hotel front desk agent.

My name is Yuval, and I run a ceramic store where we design and craft high-quality ceramic cups, specifically made for coffee shops – built to last, perfect for latte art, and fully dishwasher-safe.

I'm considering launching in the U.S. and would love to hear your thoughts – how did you choose the cups for your business, and do you think having better, more durable cups adds value in the U.S. market?

---------------------------------------------------------

Many think collagen is only for skin. But some say it helps with weight. Is this really true? Maybe not directly. I see many people ask, ""Can collagen help me lose weight?"" Collagen might help a little. It is not a quick fix. But it can support your body if you want to lose weight. In this writing, I will show you how collagen works. I will tell you if it can change your body and help your body work better. You will learn if collagen can help you manage your weight.

What is Collagen Anyway?
------------------------

Collagen is important. It is like glue for your body. It holds your skin, bones, and muscles together. It is a protein. The body has a lot of collagen. Without collagen, your body would not be strong. It helps your body work the right way. Collagen helps your skin stay young. It helps your bones stay strong. It keeps your body in good shape. So, collagen is very important for your body to be healthy.

Exploring the Link: How Collagen Might Influence Weight Loss
------------------------------------------------------------

Collagen is not a magic weight loss thing. But it may help you manage weight. It is protein. Protein helps people lose weight. Protein makes you feel full. So, you eat less. Protein can also help your muscles. Muscles burn calories. When you have more muscle, you burn more calories. So, collagen, as a protein, may help you lose weight a little bit. I see collagen can support weight loss.

Potential Mechanisms: How Collagen Could Aid Weight Management
--------------------------------------------------------------

Collagen might help you lose weight in a few ways. First, it is protein. Protein can make you feel full. When you feel full, you eat less. This helps you lose weight. Second, collagen helps your muscles. Muscles burn more calories. More muscles can help you lose weight. Collagen has important building blocks. These blocks can help keep your muscles strong. So, collagen might help you manage your weight if you try.

### Boosting Satiety and Reducing Cravings

Protein is good for feeling full. It helps stop hunger. When I eat protein, I don't want to eat more food soon. Collagen is protein. If you eat collagen, you might feel full longer. This can help you eat less food all day. If you eat less, you can lose weight. Feeling full is very important for weight loss. Collagen might help you feel satisfied. Then, you will not eat snacks between meals.

### Supporting Metabolism and Energy Expenditure

Muscles are important for burning calories. When you have more muscle, your body burns more calories all the time. Collagen helps keep your muscles strong. It gives your muscles what they need. Collagen alone cannot make you big muscles. But it helps support your muscles. When your muscles are strong, your body works better. This can help you lose weight slowly. It can also help you keep the weight off.

What Does the Research Say About Collagen and Weight Loss?
----------------------------------------------------------

Scientists are still learning about collagen and weight loss. Some studies show that collagen might help with body shape. It might help you feel full. But we do not know for sure if it helps everyone lose weight. The studies are not big enough yet. We need more scientists to study collagen. Then, we can know for sure if collagen helps with weight loss. For now, the studies are just a start.

### Examining Key Studies and Findings

Some studies look at collagen and body weight. They want to see if collagen changes how much fat you have. They also look to see if you get more muscle. Some studies use collagen peptides. These are small pieces of collagen. The studies see if these peptides change your body. One thing I see is that when people do exercise and take collagen together, it can change their body. But we need to learn more.

### Limitations and the Need for More Research

Some studies on collagen are small. Only a few people are in the studies. Also, some studies are paid for by the companies that sell collagen. This can change the results. We need bigger studies. We need studies that are not paid for by collagen companies. Then, we can know if collagen really helps with weight loss for all people. More research is very important for us to understand.

Collagen's Role in Muscle Mass and Body Composition
---------------------------------------------------

Protein is good for muscles. It helps muscles grow. Whey and casein are types of protein that people know for building muscles. But collagen also helps. Collagen has building blocks that help muscles. It helps keep muscles strong. If you have more muscle, you burn more calories. This helps you change your body shape. It helps you manage your weight better. It makes you stronger.

Beyond the Scale: Other Benefits of Taking Collagen
---------------------------------------------------

Collagen is good for more than just weight. It is good for your skin. It helps your skin look young. It is also good for your joints. It helps them move easily. So, even if collagen does not help you lose a lot of weight, it is still good for your body. It helps you stay healthy. When you are healthy, it is easier to live a good life. And living a good life can help you manage your weight.

How to Use Collagen Effectively
-------------------------------

If you want to use collagen, it is important to know how. First, you should use hydrolyzed collagen peptides. This type is easy for your body to use. Second, you should use the right amount. Most people use 5-15 grams each day. Third, you can use it any time of day. Some people like it in the morning. Some people like it after they exercise. You can mix it in your coffee or smoothie. Most important, you need to eat healthy food and exercise. Collagen is not a magic thing.

Conclusion: Does Collagen Help Weight Loss? It Might Support Your Journey
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collagen is not a weight loss magic pill. But it might help a little. It is protein. Protein can help you feel full. Collagen can also help your muscles. The science is still new. But collagen has many other good things for your body. It is good for your skin and joints. If you eat healthy and exercise, collagen might be a good thing to add.

I’m a 30-year-old guy from Michigan, looking for a meaningful, long-term connection with the right person — ideally a woman or someone feminine-presenting. I’m totally open to something online or long-distance, as long as the connection is genuine and we’re both in it for the long haul.

I’m introverted and more at home in small, quiet spaces but have my bursts of wanting to get out and explore. I love tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons, and games like Final Fantasy XIV and Warframe. I also enjoy building model kits — there’s something really relaxing and satisfying about putting something together piece by piece. I find joy in the creative and the imaginative.

Lately, I’ve been working on myself and taking my health seriously — I’ve lost 16 pounds over the last month and a half and I’m committed to staying on this path. I’ve got big goals for where I want to be physically and mentally, and I’m proud of the progress so far.

Emotionally, I’ll be honest: I’ve struggled with self-hate and trust issues in the past. I’ve been hurt, and because of that I tend to be guarded — but I’m not closed off. Once I feel safe with someone, I open up in deep and meaningful ways. I’m loyal, supportive, and I care hard. I notice the little things. I’ll remember your favorite comfort show or the way you like your coffee. I believe in emotional intimacy, and I value honest, vulnerable connection.

I’m looking for someone kind, emotionally aware, and a little nerdy wouldn’t hurt either. Someone who wants to build something steady and safe, who values emotional closeness, and who isn’t afraid of a partner who feels deeply.

If that resonates with you, feel free to reach out. I’d love to hear what you’re passionate about — whether it’s a game, a story, or just the little things that make you feel cozy. Let’s start something meaningful.",1,1747650515.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
