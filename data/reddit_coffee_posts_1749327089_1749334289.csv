We've known each other for four years. His mom, we'll call her Teresa, and I have had a few problems with each other in these last few months. She's very attached to my boyfriend in a really weird way, and it makes me really uncomfortable. So, beginning with all of the problems.

The problems started between us when my boyfriend's 23rd birthday came around. I planned this whole surprise birthday for him with his sister-in-law, and while we were setting up the party decorations, she ended up just putting things in the oddest places, and even when I asked her not to put them there, she still did. I ended up having to redo all of the decorations and put together all of the food because she threw a fit about them not being where she put them. When my boyfriend showed up with his brother after a day of golfing (the excuse to get him out of his house for the day), I asked everyone to stay inside, even though I knew all of the cars outside would give it away to him. Teresa ended up walking outside so she could ""greet her baby boy"" for his birthday and show him everything that was set up. When they came inside, it was time for prayer, so I put myself right beside him as we normally do during prayer, and she pushed herself between us, and the prayer consisted of how he had blessed her life and blah blah blah. Then his stepdad showed up, and he specifically asked if he wouldn't be there, come to find out, Teresa had invited him. My boyfriend is pissed off and just sat there silently. When it was time for presents, I asked my boyfriend if he was ready, and he said no, so I told Teresa that he wasn't ready for presents. She looked me dead in the eye and said, ""Well, this is my power as a mom, and he'll have to listen to me."" She then takes the presents out of my hands and places them in front of my boyfriend. I sit next to him so he can open his presents, and then his friend asks about his dnd dice, so I get up to show him what a character sheet is. Does his mom get in my seat when my back is turned around? No, she waits for me to turn around and go back to my seat to sit down in my seat. So at the end of the night, I ended up crying in my boyfriend's bedroom because I was so hurt and overwhelmed by what happened.

Now this is where shit hits the fan. The day before Easter, Teresa invites her daughter-in-law and I to a coffee date, and it starts nice and sweet, and then she gets into a complete dialogue about her husband, my boyfriend's stepdad, and they've been legally separated for a year now. She's talking about how when one year hits in their separation, she's going to officially leave him and how she wanted our opinions on it and for us to be honest. So I was honest and said that I didn't believe her because we've heard to so many times and that she needed to shit or get off the pot with this marriage because her actions of back and forth have been hurting everyone involved with the situation. Coffee proceeded pretty well, or at least I thought. Come Easter morning and I end up getting into a massive fight with my boyfriend because she didn't like the things that I was saying during coffee, and that I shouldn't be speaking for my boyfriend when it comes to her.

There's a lot more drama that's been happening, but other than one thing, I didn't mention, it's been basic petty stuff from her end, and I'm kinda over it, and I'm thinking of having a one on one conversation with her because it feels like every chance she gets she's trying to break us up.

This morning I think, a 30-something woman posted about potentially making friends here who was going through a hard time. I think the post was deleted because I don‚Äôt see it anymore. I thought it was a good reason to be more social on my own end and maybe make someone‚Äôs day better too. 

I live in Reno currently but need a quick get-away. I was planning on visiting on either the 13/14th for less than 24 hours and thought it would be fun to make a friend. Either way, I‚Äôm kind of a lone wolf, so based off of suggestions I‚Äôve seen on here and light internet searching, I think I‚Äôm going to try out Scorpio Coffee, Star Lounge, Rosa Madera, Catina Alley, Shady Lady, visit the farmer‚Äôs market, or maybe try to bike a bit down the river. Maybe all the fun stuff happens at night but I want to be able to drive home at a decent hour. 

Anyways, making friends is weird at our age. This post is geared towards women specifically, and maybe it won‚Äôt land and I‚Äôll delete it quickly but thought I‚Äôd put it out there :)

I did give him valentines gifts (baked goods I made myself) and cards, the last one in which I called him cute and stuff like so (he didn't respond). 

He is really funny and nerdy, likes video games and if kind of a geek. I think we match well, and he has said that I'm one of the few people he feels like he can be himself around, but that's where my worries begin. He came out as asexual when we were around 15, and all my hopes shattered then (because in my mind that means he isn't into dating at all).

But he has asked me questions which I (maybe foolishly) have taken as him being interested in me, he once asked me word for word ""are you interested in dating"", which I took as me being interested in dating him. I panicked and said ""yeah, why"" and the conversation ended there. He also has asked me about my nonexistent sex-life once when we were out having a coffee.

I know I'm probably reading too much into it, but I don't talk to any of my other friends about that kind of stuff.

We have known each other for so long that I'm afraid to ask him outright, because if it makes things awkward I will lose one of my best friends.

How can I ask him about his feelings towards me?

My girlfriend and I were helping her family move into their new house that they recently bought. Just helping unpack boxes, clean, organize. I was mostly in charge of carrying random items from the garage into the main house.

At one point I found this small, matte white plastic jar in a box with a bunch of other miscellaneous things and some kitchen utensils, spices, vitamins, etc. The jar was completely unlabelled, kind of bulky, and honestly looked very similar to a supplement container. (I never bought one but I‚Äôve seen them somewhere around and kinda have an idea of what this is, lol, or not). You know, the type you get from a health store with protein powder or creatine inside.

So I figured, ‚ÄúThis must go in the kitchen with the rest of the food stuff.‚Äù
Later that day, while we were all having coffee, her dad suddenly says:

‚ÄúWhy the heck is this here?!‚Äù 

I thought he was joking because instead of putti g it next to the vitamins I left on the top of the fridge. and I replied ‚Äú it was heavy ngl that must be premium or something‚Äú

EVERYONE LOOKED AT ME DEAD (side joke) SILENT. Apparently‚Ä¶ that white jar was her grandfather.Apparently they were afraid to break it so they placedit into a plastic one with extra protection to avoid breaking it in movings.

If I may add, you're like a piece of living work of art. A living marble satue that Michealangelo carved out off. Beisdes your visual appearance and your quiet demure. In the end, I did see you as potential friend. Even when we didn't get as far as established friendship.

I had sense that Universe had been working hard into an effort with keeping our paths criss crossing. I had wished upon the universe to be able to work with you, for one last time. Henceforth, I was genuinely surprised to have seen you there 1 Friday and I did initially wanted to greet you with a hug to say; ""welcome back again"". But instead, I had restrained myself acting out my true self and kept our greeting semi-formal and out of respect for your work personal space. By the end of work, you were willing to drop a hint that the following Friday, you would return and that will be your very last olive branch into helping out my work ship.

Now our borrowed time has ended and that the Universe has ended our criss crossing pathways. I had accepted that we couldn't establish atlest a foothold into knowing, we could have been friends outside work settings. This is the case, from thoes past 12 Fridays' agos.
As much as I had wanted to connect to you as established friends. I dared not to ask you for a coffee meet up, while we were in borrowed times, considering how verbally upset, your partner became. Your partner called me out and gave me an ear bashing, quite rightly because I had contacted you about a public social event and not a work related topic beforehand. For that I'm sorry and I had misjudged how my messaage may have been preceived. As you nither appeared to be bothered or you didn‚Äôt want to become friends with me, out of resepct for your partner. You took your partner into your life, way way before you met me.

Overall, I do miss having male friends within my circle of friends. I do have male friends who are in my family life and my work ship settings. I do have one male friend and he's an old class friend of mine. We barely met up once a year and on a good year we could plan to meet up twice.

I do feel that our opportunity has been closed shut for now and you'll become part of my memories of people whom I have met in my life time.
I pray that you'll get to continue to act on your own wishes and gratitude. Don't get held back by anyone else, your partner or even to yourself.
Take care and one day, maybe our eyes will meet up again, when criss crossing pathways once more.

And I‚Äôm lowkey terrified.","I had a 130-page project spec land on my desk (well, my coffee-stained M2 MacBook). Looked like a solid 4‚Äì6 month job for a solo developer. Maybe 2‚Äì3 months with a small team: front-end dev, back-end dev, AI engineer. The usual gig.

But I decided to build it myself. Just me, coffee, some context switching, a few client calls, and **lots of AI**.

I wasn‚Äôt even in hyperfocus mode. Just 10 hours of actual coding over 3 days. The rest was piecing together API docs, feeding prompts into LLMs, fixing JSON outputs, and babysitting GPT when it hallucinated.

Let‚Äôs do the math:

* **Estimated man-days**: 75‚Äì115
* **Team config**: 3 people, 2‚Äì3 months
* **Expected cost**: \~$75,000 (Korea-based team rate)
* **My cost**: \~$3,000 worth of my time and GPT API
* **Productivity gain**: \~25x

Yeah. I basically time-traveled.

# Here‚Äôs what the original scope included:

* üß† AI prompt engineering (GPT, DALL¬∑E, etc.)
* üõ†Ô∏è Backend (FastAPI, DB modeling, OAuth2 login, JWT, CRUD, async endpoints)
* üñºÔ∏è Frontend (Vue 3 + Pinia, Axios, modals, responsive UI)
* üß™ Full-stack integration & testing
* üì¶ Data cleaning + JSON parsing from AI outputs

Normally, you‚Äôd need a decent-sized team to juggle all this without losing your mind.

But with AI?  
I just... didn‚Äôt need the team.

# The scary part?

I‚Äôm not even a full-stack prodigy or a 10x engineer. I just knew how to ask the right questions ‚Äî to GPT, to docs, to myself.  
And somehow, that was enough to replace months of work.

**AI didn‚Äôt just help me build faster. It collapsed the gap between idea and execution.**

This isn‚Äôt a flex. It‚Äôs a warning ‚Äî or maybe a revelation.  
Because I don‚Äôt know if I should feel **proud** or **terrified**.

After baking the cake (about 4 or 5pm) I was going to start on dinner but started feeling a bit dizzy. Thought it might be because I didn't eat enough that day (I only had that cake with my coffee for the whole day) so made myself an easy dinner instead of the one I had planned. 

After dinner I thought I felt better but started getting these crazy heart palpitations. I really had to sit there and wait for it to pass. It eventually did but then I got this really uneasy feeling that I've never had before that something was wrong. I started getting clammy hands and my left arm was tingling all the way through. I was worried I was going to have a heart attack or stroke. I even did that ""raise both arms and keep it there"" stroke test and my left arm was wavering a bit. So i called the non urgent medical line who called an ambulance. 

I waited for the ambulance and in the meantime I called a friend so at least someone in the area knew what was happening to me just in case. I was actually quite panicked as I hadn't ever had this feeling before but I didn't want anyone to worry, but as I was explaining to my friend I cried a little. 

I sat there a while and after 25 mins the ambulance hadn't arrived. I don't think I feel quite as dizzy now, no more clammy hands and no more heart palpitations. My left arm is still feeling slightly weird but not as tingly as it was before. Still having this slightly dull pressure feeling in my temples. So I called to say I didn't need an ambulance anymore and I'd just keep an eye to make sure I was okay. 

So I'm wondering whether this is a panic attack? Has anyone experienced this as a result of their grief? I've never felt like this before.

At first, it‚Äôs kind of flattering, but after it happens a few times, it feels a little scripted. Like, can we at least grab coffee first? No casual hangouts, just straight to the invite to their place.

I know it‚Äôs not everyone, but honestly, now when I see ‚Äúbaby‚Äù or ‚Äúbabe‚Äù early on, I get a little triggered. I‚Äôm just hoping to find someone who‚Äôs interested in actually getting to know me first.

Anyone else notice this? Or am I just overly cautious?

I was raised.... perhaps better phrased brainwashed to be a Pharisee. Follow the rules my boy!! No TV, no books other than the Bible and approved Devotionals or Biblical literature. Definitely no music lol... other than selected singers... like Michael Card. Hyms, music without a beat. The less guitar the better. Please don't use drums. 

I enjoyed pointing at others and chastising them, hating them. Teens talking about the latest movies in school? It's very important they know they're going to burn in hell. Oh no here comes the Bible thumper again, it was so much fun to carry my Bible around and yell verses at people, yeah I thought I was on the path to heaven. 

One day at 19 or 20? I walked into a coffee shop and TVU was playing. The show opened up with some guy responding to letters from fans to read the lyrics from Blindside Pitiful. He never played the music video he just read the lyrics. 

""As I recall with my stomach turning I was hiding away from myself away from you"" 

""I pretended that you looked away thought you never did so I could walk where I don't belong"" 

""I remember every word you said, come back in time come back. I remember every word you said come back in time come back"" 

God came to me and knocked upon my prison door?? He came to me in my filth, lies and deceit and begged me to come back?(from other Blindside songs and Wolves at The Gate) God will run to us in our darkest hour while the angels cry and he won't let the color of my eyes fade? 

I couldn't understand it... so many lyrics with such beautiful promises and descriptions of humans living on filth. But humans like that are lost for good? There's no point preaching to them or befriending them they'll sully my soul. 

I listened to Pitiful in secret üôä and felt dirty disgusting and wrong for listening to it. Later I went to a revival and threw the CD in the fire and oh it lifted the burden on my soul... it freed me... but I couldn't shake the lyrics. ""Come back in time come back"" no I won't. ""Come back in time come back"" begone from me devil. Knocking on my prison door ""come back in time come back"" 

Being an adult I purchased the CD again and felt so sickened to my soul it was so wrong.. the person at the store recommended several other CDs Demon Hunter, Evanescence(when people thought she was Christian... she sang of baptism and bring me to life so... story is the songwriter was using Christian lyrics??) RED, The Benjamin Gate and many others. 

When I got to the song Silence on the Blindside CD I began to cry. I ended up in the fetal position bawling. For a man who never cries this is huge. It took many years to move to Demon Hunter and Wolves at the Gate it felt so very wrong I was so brainwashed its possible that this process was so had so painful because I was possessed by a demon? Or I had just let the devil take so much root into my soul that removing him took years of pain and suffering. 

Isaiah 41:8-13 paraphrased tells us that we were so lost in darkness depravity and depression that we accepted the chains of the devil God came to us in our darkest hour according to the Hebrew language, and called us a worm as if we had borrowed ourselves in so deep we thought the light but a dream there is no light but God called us Jacob His beloved and promised to uphold us and shame our enemies. (Why did my church avoid verses like these?) Falling Up lead me to them. 

My family tried to rescue me lol.. by sending me to a Christian center in the hills of California but they made one crucial mistake, they took us to target to pick up toiletries and things we might need. When they were loading up the van I said I desperately needed the bathroom and ran in lol and purchased Flyleaf Memento Mori and asked the attendant if I could hide it down my pants lol brief explanation lol. They encouraged long prayer walks and handed out cd players that had select sermons on them lol with a sharp rock I managed to cut open the tape on one of them and put my CD in and hid in some tree roots lol. I'm not sure how I got away with it but I claimed that I had not checked out one of the discmans. They searched and thankfully gave up and I'd swap the discman on my walk and swap it back. (I wonder if someone might find a discman with Memento Mori in it one day?) Listening to Memento Mori on Repeat for 6 weeks took away that shame and disgust for CCM I felt 

I came home and gave The Benjamin Gate Untitled to my sister who listened to it on runs. My father even learned to love several softer Christian artists hearing him sing Modern Day Moses by Kendall Payne even today makes me cry tears of joy. My church split in half... well 75% to 80+ left and formed their own little cult and it spread to churches around us even the one that would drag people out the door for bringing a guitar lol. No piano.. only Organ music occasionally but they preferred voices only... 

So TLDR.. lol Christian Metal saved my soul. There's not a day that goes by that I won't tear up over Christian Metal lyrics, some people still don't understand but they're begging to die of old age, not that I refuse to stop praying for them

I recently limited contact with him ‚Äî did I overreact and should I reconnect with him?

While my main manager was on personal leave, I temporarily reported to her manager. It was uncomfortable from the start as he often tried to undermine me and make me feel incompetent. Then it escalated.

He gave me inappropriate looks ‚Äî like when I walked up the stairs in front of him and when I turned my head I noticed him checking me out. The same when he was holding a door to let me in first. Other colleagues seemed to notice too, which made it even more humiliating.

During one of a regular status meetings, he insisted we go for coffee in a secluded spot. He sat very close, deliberately touching my leg and arm with his leg and arm, and leaned in so close I could feel his breath. I froze ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt look at him or back away, just stayed still, trying not to show discomfort and he kept sitting like that for couple of minutes observing my reaction.

After that, I started staying home during the days when w had neetings to avoid any further situations like that or even worse. He began declining the meetings entirely whenever he did not see me in the office, which blocked my progress.

""Please, take care of him,"" I begged, struggling to keep my hands wrapped tightly around the stretcher.

""We have to take him now. Please, step back,"" the man in the pale blue scrubs pried my fingers from the rough green fabric where Noah lay unconscious. Stupid nurse. I glared at him with tear-filled eyes and shrank back.

There he was, the boy I loved most in the world, being wheeled away by the hospital staff, completely unresponsive. His pale skin looked even whiter than usual, his sunken eyes surrounded by dark shadows, his lips and nails tinged purple. He looked like he had been beaten, but no‚Äîhe had simply collapsed.

Could I have prevented it? Could I? The tears fell uncontrollably.

Max caught me just as the stretcher disappeared behind the double doors separating the emergency room from the corridor. I turned and clung to him, resting my head against the damp black hoodie he wore, though it made little difference. We were both already soaked from the relentless rain outside.

""He‚Äôs going to be okay,"" Max whispered, running his hand gently over the top of my head.

""Promise?"" My vision was so blurry I couldn‚Äôt see his face, only feel him nod silently. The sharp scent of rain on his hoodie filled my nose, dragging my mind back to everything that had happened minutes earlier‚Äîeverything I wished so desperately was just a nightmare. Anything, even this, was better than the sterile hospital smell.

I wanted to believe Noah would be fine. I would do anything to make sure of it. But the chances of him surviving were slim. It wasn‚Äôt the first time he had collapsed and ended up in the hospital. Lately, it had been happening more and more, and that terrified me.

I still remember the day he told me about his heart condition. We had known each other for years, and he had never even hinted at something so serious. I never understood why he chose that particular day to tell me, but that was also the day I confessed I loved him.

I pressed my face deeper into Max‚Äôs hoodie, holding him tighter. For the first time, I was terrified of losing someone I loved.

¬†

**FLASHBACK**

¬†

*""I could die at any moment, Emily,"" he said softly, watching me as tears escaped my eyes. My heart froze.*

*""I have a heart condition. Last night I passed out. I went to the doctor and he told me if I don‚Äôt get a transplant soon, I could die at any time."" His words felt like a knife piercing deep into my stomach.*

*The park was cloaked in shadows even though it was still daytime. The autumn wind tossed the leaves from the trees‚Äîthe season I loved most. Noah brushed his thumb gently against my cheek, trying to wipe away the tears that refused to stop.*

*""I‚Äôm already on the transplant list,"" he whispered. ""But it could take years.""*

*I grasped his hand, not knowing what to say. ""Isn‚Äôt there a way to... pay to move you to the top of the list?"" I gave a desperate, hopeful smile, even though I knew that wasn‚Äôt how it worked.*

*He squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head, tightening his grip on my hand. ""No, Emily. Even if that were possible, it would cost a fortune. My parents don‚Äôt have that kind of money."" The words punched a hole straight through my chest.*

*""I‚Äôll get a job. College can wait. It‚Äôs not important,"" I pressed his hand to my cheek as if I might kiss it.*

*Noah lowered his gaze as if weighing thoughts too heavy to speak. He stayed like that for several minutes.*

*""It doesn‚Äôt work that way. It‚Äôs about medical priority and donor compatibility... This is one of the few things money can‚Äôt buy.""*

*The silence stretched again. Noah finally looked up at me and shook his head slowly. ""Seriously? Your future is more important. Your money can‚Äôt fix me.""*

*""There is no future without you,"" I whispered, unable to hold his gaze any longer. Why wouldn‚Äôt he let me help? Or at least try? Couldn‚Äôt he see that nothing made sense without him? That everything would be worse, emptier?*

*His skin was cold, and he looked more fragile than ever. He wore a beanie instead of his usual messy hair. He let go of my hand and slowly traced the length of my arm up to my hair. The soft gesture only made me cry harder.*

*I took a deep breath.*

*""I love you, Noah,"" I murmured, lowering my head again. I could feel his eyes fixed on me. His fingers gently twisted strands of my wavy hair, something he had always loved to do.*

*""I know you love me. I love you too,"" he said gently. His free hand slid to my neck, lifting my chin with a finger so I had no choice but to meet his soft hazel eyes. He smiled faintly; the purplish tint on his lips couldn‚Äôt dull his beauty.*

*I shook my head.*

*""No, you misunderstood,"" I whispered. ""Not just as my best friend. I love you, Noah Beckett.""*

*I didn‚Äôt know if it was the right thing to say, or if the moment was even right. But he had to know. To me, he was so much more than my best friend, even if I rarely let that show.*

*I stood up and slowly walked away from him. He stayed seated on the empty carousel, deserted because of the cold. I stopped beneath the biggest tree in the park. I had just confessed something I had promised myself I‚Äôd never say aloud. A feeling I had buried, afraid he didn‚Äôt feel the same. Not that he‚Äôd mock me for it‚ÄîI knew him too well‚Äîbut I feared he would distance himself from me. That was a risk I couldn‚Äôt take.*

*The tears spilled faster now, and I no longer cared to hold them back. My heart raced faster than I thought possible. The cold wind stirred the scent of wet leaves and earth, making my head spin.*

*Suddenly, I felt a warm hand wrap around mine, guiding me gently back toward him. It was Noah. Always with that delicate, steady touch only he had.*

*I avoided looking at him until he tilted my chin again, studying my tear-streaked face. I felt his breath, soft and close, as he leaned toward me, his hazel eyes never leaving mine. My heart beat violently.*

*I squeezed my eyes shut as his hand cupped my cheek. One, two, three... I turned my head away at the last second and opened my eyes to meet his confused stare. I couldn‚Äôt let this happen‚Äînot now, not after everything. I didn‚Äôt want him to kiss me just because I had confessed.*

*He stood there frozen, head lowered. I turned and walked away toward home.*

*""Emily,"" he called after me in his low, raspy voice. I kept walking, pretending not to hear. The tears kept falling. What he didn‚Äôt know was that kissing him was all I had wanted.*

¬†

**END OF FLASHBACK**

¬†

""I don‚Äôt want to lose him, Max,"" I whispered as he hugged me tighter and kissed the top of my head. Normally, his embrace brought me peace, but not this time. The pain I felt was unbearable‚Äîa knot in my stomach that made me want to throw up. My legs shook, and the tears didn‚Äôt stop for a single second.

I pulled away just enough to look at Max. His expression was full of agony. I knew he wanted to fix everything for me, he always cared that way, but this time he couldn‚Äôt. There was nothing anyone could do. Slowly, he stepped back, his eyes filling with tears. I curled up as I watched him turn and walk down the corridor, disappearing around the corner.

I thought about how I had been cold with him the day Noah first told me about his condition. I had left him alone in the cold when I should‚Äôve walked him home. What kind of friend was I? My stomach twisted again.

Suddenly, I felt someone grab my hand and pull me into a comforting hug. It was Logan. He took off his dry green jacket and draped it over my shoulders. It was still warm.

""Emily, don‚Äôt cry. It‚Äôs going to be okay. Believe that,"" Logan whispered as he put an arm around me and guided me to a row of chairs along the corridor. He sat down beside me, turned to face me, took my hand, and held it tightly. ""I‚Äôm here with you.""

Those words gave me a few precious moments of comfort‚Äîbut only a few. The memories and fear came rushing back almost immediately. My stomach growled, but I didn‚Äôt want to eat.

I could only imagine how I must have looked: my eyes swollen from crying, mascara smudged, hair messy and soaked, clothes dirty. How were they even able to hold me like this?

I took a deep breath and tried to nod, remembering what Logan had just said.

Noah‚Äôs parents were on their way. Probably just his mom and brother‚Äîhis dad was always away for work.

I lowered my head into my hands, my fingers now wrinkled and pale from the rain. I kept whispering the same words over and over under my breath, ""Just believe,"" as I tapped the toe of my shoe nervously against the floor.

Logan hugged me again and started doing the same.

¬†

**FLASHBACK**

¬†

*I walked down to the edge of the lake and knelt down. I needed to grab my bag, which had fallen in and was slowly drifting farther away with the current. The camp still had two more days left, and I couldn‚Äôt spend the rest of it without clothes or my things. I had waited for everyone to fall asleep so I could sneak out and swim after it. I had no idea who had knocked it in, but I was sure it hadn‚Äôt been an accident.*

*A noise rustled in the bushes behind me. I quickly turned and pointed my flashlight‚Äîjust a squirrel. I let out a relieved sigh and set the flashlight aside as I prepared to dive in. Just as I pushed off, someone yanked me backward.*

*‚ÄúAre you crazy, Emily?‚Äù Noah grabbed my waist to stop me from falling straight into the water. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù he said softly as he gently lowered me to the ground.*

*How had he found me? I was sure he‚Äôd been asleep. I rolled my eyes.*

*‚ÄúMy bag, Noah.‚Äù I stood again and tried to head toward the water, but he blocked me and nudged me back down. I stared at him in disbelief. I needed that bag. All my stuff was in there, including my favourite book.*

*‚ÄúYour life is worth more than a bag, clothes, or any of your things,‚Äù he said, pointing to where the bag now floated even farther out than before. ‚ÄúYou can buy new stuff, even better stuff. But your life is irreplaceable.‚Äù*

*He reached down and helped me to my feet, holding my hands as he always did. Classic Noah, always with one of those serious little speeches.*

*‚ÄúYou can wear my clothes. Do you have a problem with that?‚Äù I looked into his eyes and shook my head. He smiled warmly, wrapped me in a tight hug, and whispered as we walked back toward the tents, ‚ÄúHey, you mean a lot to me.‚Äù*

*I smiled as I felt his warm breath close to my ear.*

*Back at the tents, he handed me a set of clothes he thought would fit and kissed me gently on the forehead before disappearing into the tent he shared with Max and Logan. I crawled into the one I shared with Ronnie.*

**END OF FLASHBACK**

¬†

I was pulled from my thoughts by the soft, delicate sound of someone crying. It was discreet, yet undeniably there. I searched for the source and quickly spotted Lauren, Noah‚Äôs mother. Logan loosened the arm he had around my waist, giving me space to go to her. The warmth of his hug and his sweet scent vanished, replaced by the cold air and sharp hospital smells.

Lauren walked quickly toward me and held out her hand as she stopped in front of me. I stood, and she hugged me tightly, finally letting herself cry freely. I had never seen her cry before; it shocked me. My heart froze.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be okay,‚Äù she whispered, holding me tightly. I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. As she pulled away, I caught sight of James, Noah‚Äôs brother, standing hunched in a corner, barely holding himself together.

‚ÄúJames, sweetheart, go with Emily to get something to eat. She‚Äôs been here for hours and needs to eat,‚Äù Lauren said gently but firmly. James reluctantly walked toward us, his usual brooding scowl on full display. I didn‚Äôt want to eat, especially not with him, but I couldn‚Äôt say no to Lauren.

James led the way down the hall and around the corner toward the cafeteria. I glanced back to look for Logan, but he had disappeared. I sighed and followed James, who was walking slowly, dragging his feet.

When we stopped in front of the elevator, James suddenly pulled me into a hug. I froze for a second before realizing he was crying. It was the first time he had ever hugged me‚Äîactually, the first time he had hugged anyone as far as I knew.

I wanted so badly to ask if he was okay, to offer comfort, but I was too afraid he would shut down. So, I simply hugged him back. I had been at the hospital for hours, but food was the last thing on my mind. My legs shook, and when the elevator chimed, James pulled away.

As we walked through the hospital, I observed the people around us‚Äîchildren, worried parents, and friends anxiously waiting. I had never imagined myself in a place like this. Whoever does?

Each tear-streaked child, each worried face felt like a blow to my heart. I wanted to run, to scream. Patients lay in observation rooms with IVs in their arms, a frail elderly woman with a feeding tube in her nose. My stomach churned.

So many people out there trying to end their lives, while others desperately fought or prayed for just one more day. Life can be so twisted‚Äîthose who lack life cling to it, while those who have it waste it.

We finally reached the cafeteria. The walls were half white, half beige. The rich scent of coffee hung thick in the air. Some people sat at tables, chatting and laughing like they weren‚Äôt inside a hospital at all.

James glanced at me. ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù he asked, trying to hide the strain in his voice. I shrugged; he knew I wasn‚Äôt picky.

Turning to the woman at the counter, he ordered, ‚ÄúTwo mochas, a slice of apple pie, and a grilled cheese, please.‚Äù He smiled at her politely, then led me to a table near the counter and sat across from me.

My throat tightened with the words I wanted to say, but I waited, giving him space. I watched him as he picked up a piece of pie with his fingers, hesitating before taking a bite.

‚ÄúEmily‚Ä¶‚Äù he started, his voice faltering. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared. I wish I could apologize to him. I know I act like I don‚Äôt care, but I do. He‚Äôs my brother. I‚Äôve never told him I love him. He‚Äôs always been there for me, and I‚Äôve taken him for granted. I want to change. I want to be the brother he deserves. I just want one more chance.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, fighting back tears.

‚ÄúHe knows you love him, and he loves you too. You know how he is‚Äîhe‚Äôs Noah,‚Äù I whispered, squeezing his hand and meeting his eyes. ‚ÄúWe just have to have faith.‚Äù

James nodded and squeezed my hand back.

‚ÄúI know you love him too. I know you never wanted any of this to happen. I honestly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do if something happens to him.‚Äù

I tried to give a reassuring smile, but it faltered. I couldn‚Äôt speak anymore; my voice was stuck in my throat.

He knew I loved Noah? If James knew‚Ä¶ did that mean everyone knew?

I stared silently as the woman placed the tray on our table. The warm scent of chocolate and coffee drifted into my nose. I shrank into my chair.

**FLASHBACK**

¬†

*""Ems, you're doing it wrong,"" Noah laughed as he smeared a bit of sweetened condensed milk on my cheek. It was that laugh I never got tired of, the one only he had. ""You're a terrible cook. Poor guy who ends up marrying you; he‚Äôll live off takeout, pizza, and restaurants every weekend.""*

*I made a face, laughing as I flicked some cocoa powder at him. He dodged it easily. We were trying to make brigadeiro, as we always did. It was a Brazilian recipe his aunt had taught him one summer he spent there. He was an expert in the kitchen, unlike me, who had always been hopeless, and he loved teasing me about it.*

*""Noah, you're such a dork. You know that, right? At least there are people who like me, even knowing that,"" I said, tapping him on the head with the wooden spoon.*

*""Oh, I know,"" he chuckled, winking at me and making me blush. ""Want the great chef Noah to give you a few lessons? Just to save your future marriage a little?""*

*He struck a dramatic pose like one of those movie heartthrobs I hated‚Äîand he knew it. We dumped the cocoa powder into the pot with the sweetened condensed milk and butter.*

*""I'm fine the way I am. He‚Äôll just have to love me like this,"" I said, covering his eyes playfully while he kept stirring.*

*After a few minutes, the brigadeiro was ready. He scooped a bit with the spoon and touched it to my cheek.*

*""Ow, Noah! It‚Äôs burning!"" I shrieked, making him jump and scramble to get a glass of water to cool my now-sensitive skin. He gently blew on it and kissed the spot.*

*I smiled.*

*""It‚Äôll pass, Ems,"" he whispered, softly brushing his fingers over the spot as he gazed at me.*

¬†

**END OF FLASHBACK**

¬†

Why were these memories coming back? All of it made me want to hug him and never let go. To hear that unique voice again and believe everything would be okay. I just wanted‚Ä¶ and as far as I know, wanting doesn‚Äôt mean having.

I took a bite of my grilled ham and cheese sandwich, watching James distracted with his apple pie. I smiled. He wasn‚Äôt the monster I thought he was. He just needed someone to talk to, someone who understood him, someone he could trust.

""I‚Äôm here for you, James, for whatever you need,"" I whispered, thinking he wouldn‚Äôt hear me. But James looked up and smiled. He had heard.

I glanced around at the people sitting near us. I tried to imagine what each of them might be going through, feeling, and what they might have to overcome. Life really is just a box of surprises.

¬†

¬†

I felt someone shaking me, and I opened my eyes to find Max. I had fallen asleep on Logan‚Äôs shoulder after James and I had wandered back to the waiting room in search of updates that never came. My head throbbed painfully, and I was still in the same clothes, now dry. I raised my hand to my head, trying to understand what was happening. It was already daytime, and sunlight flooded the entire room through the huge windows. The sterile hospital smell made me shudder, just like before.

‚ÄúAny news?‚Äù I asked but received no answer. James had already left; he was preparing for his bar exam. Without a word, Max handed me a backpack. I looked at him in confusion. It was filled with clean, dry clothes. Only then did I notice he had changed too, now wearing a sports team T-shirt and jeans‚Äîhis typical look. I grabbed the bag and headed toward the nearby restroom.

The bathroom was empty. Just me, the bag, and the mirror I chose not to look into. I emptied the contents of the bag onto the closed toilet lid. The lighting was poor, one bulb flickering and another barely giving off any light. Creepy. I slipped into the denim shorts and long-sleeve black shirt, stuffing my wet clothes back into the backpack. The sickly scent of the bar soap made me nauseous.

I caught my reflection by accident. I looked terrible. My eyes were dark with circles, my hair was a dry, tangled mess, and strange purple marks dotted my skin. I washed my face and dried it with toilet paper‚Äîthe only available option.

When I stepped out, Max and Logan were waiting for me, one on each side, taking my arms and leading me down the hall. I staggered with every step. We passed the waiting room, and my stomach tightened.

‚ÄúWhere are you taking me?‚Äù I asked, receiving only silence in return. I was starting to panic. We entered the elevator and stopped at the fourth floor. The doors opened. Nurses walked calmly through the hallway, some chatting and laughing.

What was this place? Maternity? They kept guiding me forward. The air on this floor felt different‚Äîmore peaceful, with none of the harsh disinfectant odor or the sickly sweet soap from the bathroom. A nurse nodded subtly at them. I still had no idea what was going on; I just wanted to return to the waiting room and beg any doctor for news about Noah.

We finally stopped in front of a white door with silver details: room 429.

‚ÄúOne, two, three,‚Äù they counted together, then opened the door.

My eyes instantly filled with tears. My legs trembled, my hands shook, and goosebumps spread across my skin. Slowly, step by shaky step, I approached, a smile growing wider with each movement. Was I dreaming?

The white room made me want to cry with joy. The bright red tulips on the dresser, the untouched breakfast tray, the faint scent of the only cologne that belonged to him‚Äîit all felt too real. I rested my hands on the edge of the bed.

I glanced around. Lauren‚Äôs bag rested on the small couch, magazines sat beside the tulips, some of his clothes lay folded on the armrest. I turned to the door to see Max and Logan smile and quietly close it behind them.

I turned back to him. Just him. This was real.

I took a deep breath.

For a moment, I hesitated to touch Noah‚Äôs hand, but I needed it. I gently slid my hand over his left hand. The soft warmth of his skin made me want to cry out in joy. I could feel his steady pulse, and the beeping machine beside me reminded me with every passing second.

The pale, bluish color that had covered his face yesterday was gone. His complexion was pink, full of life, which made me practically burst with happiness. His chest slowly rose and fell, the most beautiful movement I had ever seen, something that had seemed insignificant only the morning before. He was sleeping.

I circled the bed and sat in the chair by his side‚ÄîLauren‚Äôs chair, I assumed. I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off him. So beautiful, so Noah. I wanted to wrap my arms around him and never let go, to hear him say everything was okay, or that this was all just a prank show.

I held his hand tighter, then laid my head gently on the edge of the bed, closing my eyes and breathing in his faint scent that made me smile.

¬†

**FLASHBACK**

¬†

*""Emily, just leave me alone,"" he paced back and forth, trying to control the anger that radiated from him. I knew how badly he wanted to go to that concert, but he couldn‚Äôt. The headache and shortness of breath made it impossible.*

*""Noah, I‚Äôm not going to let you go. It‚Äôs not worth the risk,"" I gestured with my hands as he stopped and stared at me, clearly searching for a comeback. ""It‚Äôs not even your favourite band,"" I added indignantly as I remembered that detail. ""It‚Äôs going to be crowded and suffocating in there."" I crossed my arms, realizing nothing seemed capable of changing his mind. He resumed pacing in frustration.*

*I sighed and tried one last time. ""Please, stay!"" My eyes met his, pleading.*

*He rolled his eyes but finally gave in, relaxing his shoulders. ""Okay, I‚Äôll stay since I have no other choice. But you owe me big time,"" he teased, pulling a funny face to make me laugh‚Äîand succeeded. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I could do to make up for the missed concert.*

*""It‚Äôs for your own good, right?"" he said. I nodded.*

*I smiled.*

*""Always."" I grabbed his hand, feeling the soft warmth of his skin, a sensation I could never get tired of. ""Let‚Äôs make brigadeiro."" I knew it was the perfect way to cheer him up, though I wasn‚Äôt sure it would work this time. He hugged me, still pretending to be annoyed, but I didn‚Äôt care. The frown quickly faded when I placed a kiss on his cheek. He smiled wide.*

¬†

**END OF FLASHBACK**

¬†

I felt something move against my hand. I opened my eyes slowly and lifted my head. My vision was blurry. Had I fallen asleep?

‚ÄúGood morning, Ems,‚Äù I froze. That raspy voice slipped into my ears and sent a shiver down my spine. My heart raced. My vision quickly cleared so I could see. Him. Tears spilled down my cheeks as I smiled. Those honey-colored eyes gazed back at me, shining like they always had. He smiled, full of life. I couldn‚Äôt let go of his hand, nor could I move. Everything felt like a dream‚Äîa dream I must have been having all these hours in the hospital. The sun lit up his fair skin and his messy light brown hair. Even here, he managed to look beautiful.

I snapped out of my trance when he gently pulled me up by the hand, hugging me tightly, which only made the tears flow harder. That‚Äôs when I realized I wasn‚Äôt dreaming.

‚ÄúI was so scared of losing you,‚Äù I whispered as he pulled away just enough to look at me and entwine our fingers. My tears stained his hospital gown, but he didn‚Äôt care at all.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never lose me. Never,‚Äù he smiled warmly, softly squeezing my hand and studying my face. ‚ÄúEms, you look like a disaster. What happened?‚Äù He frowned playfully and then laughed. I just shook my head.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still beautiful, even like this,‚Äù he added, making me blush furiously. I bit my lip and took a deep breath.

I stepped back, trying to remember something, but nothing came to mind. A knock at the door made both of us turn our heads. I opened it to find Max, Logan, and Ronnie entering with big smiles. I slipped back out quietly, unnoticed. I pulled out my phone. I had to let James know his brother had woken up.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù his voice answered on the other end. I trembled.

‚ÄúJames, it‚Äôs Emily!‚Äù I whispered, trying not to disturb anyone. ‚ÄúI just wanted to tell you that Noah woke up, and I really think you two should talk.‚Äù I crossed my fingers, hoping for a positive response.

‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.‚Äù I smiled at how fast I could imagine him rushing to get dressed. I hung up and went back to the room. Everyone looked at me. Ronnie just hugged me silently.

Noah kept staring at me, which only made me more self-conscious. My legs were still shaky, and I had no idea what to do or say. I had waited so long for this moment, yet it felt so strange.

‚ÄúNoah, did you know Emily hasn‚Äôt left the hospital since you were brought in?‚Äù Max said, walking over to the bed and glancing at me, prompting Noah to do the same with a surprised expression.

‚ÄúI swear,‚Äù Max added. I rolled my eyes.

He didn‚Äôt need to say that. It didn‚Äôt matter whether I had stayed here the whole time or not. What mattered was that Noah was okay.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really good to know,‚Äù Noah‚Äôs words slowly filled my ears, sending chills through my body. I smiled.

‚ÄúWould anyone do that for me?‚Äù Ronnie teased, looking at Max, who fell silent, flustered.

Logan remained quiet the entire time I was there. I even considered leaving because I felt awkward, but I didn‚Äôt have to. They all decided to leave on their own. I walked them to the door and saw James sitting on a bench nearby, waiting for us to finish. He met my eyes, and I winked as I passed him and he entered. The door closed. I silently hoped everything would go well between them. Long minutes passed before the door finally opened again.

‚ÄúNoah wants to see you, Emily,‚Äù James said, winking and smiling at me. I smiled back and slowly walked toward the door he held open.

‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù he whispered as I passed. I stepped inside and gently shut the door behind me.

‚ÄúHi, Ems,‚Äù Noah‚Äôs smile could melt anyone‚Äîor maybe that was just the effect it had on me. ‚ÄúCome sit next to me,‚Äù he said playfully, patting the bed beside him where I had been leaning earlier. My stomach clenched and my legs trembled. I was scared of what he might say, though I couldn‚Äôt explain why. I took a deep breath and tried to mask the nervous expression I was sure was plastered on my face.

I sat down and smiled.

‚ÄúYou need to rest, Noah,‚Äù I tried to sound calm as he shook his head. ‚ÄúPlease. You‚Äôll get better faster and go home sooner.‚Äù I smiled again.

‚ÄúI want to talk to you first. Then I‚Äôll rest,‚Äù he insisted, gently wrapping my hand in his. I sighed and gave him a defeated expression, which only made him chuckle. There was no use; he‚Äôd keep pushing until I gave in.

‚ÄúWhat do you feel for me, Emily?‚Äù he asked, locking eyes with mine.

My whole body froze. This was what I had been afraid of. I tried to cover it up and looked back at him indignantly.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this the most inappropriate time to ask me that?‚Äù I pulled my hand away as he lowered his gaze.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in a hospital, Noah. You have your whole life ahead of you. Why now?‚Äù I stood as if to leave, but he gently held my hand again. Seeing him like that broke my heart. I had never told him no before; I had never needed to.

‚ÄúI need to know. Please.‚Äù He tugged me toward him, laying my head on his chest. I stayed silent, simply breathing in his sweet scent. It was funny how even in a hospital, his scent remained. His scent. I was addicted to it. He began stroking my hair softly. I closed my eyes.

¬†¬†

**FLASHBACK**

¬†

*I couldn‚Äôt walk any farther. Everything was spinning. I was sick and burning up with fever. I was allergic to blackberries. The trees at camp swayed back and forth as my stomach churned and the urge to throw up tightened in my throat. I never should have eaten that blackberry out of spite toward Noah. What had I been thinking? My legs shook as I glanced around, unable to see anyone. My skin was covered in red blotches. My eyelids grew heavy, and my breathing turned shallow. I felt the cold wind brush my face just as my body collapsed onto the damp, icy ground. Everything went black. I fainted.*

*‚ÄúBeep... beep... beep... beep...‚Äù An annoying noise interrupted my dream. I opened my eyes. Where was I? Was I in heaven? Had I died? The room was completely white, flowers sat on a counter, giving the space an almost heavenly appearance. I looked down at my arms and saw a tube. I followed it with my eyes‚ÄîIV, monitors... hospital. I was in a hospital.*

*‚ÄúEms, thank God you‚Äôre okay.‚Äù Noah hugged me as my parents smiled warmly. The sound of his voice made my head throb painfully. I wished I could fall back asleep without people staring at me. It was uncomfortable.*

*‚ÄúSweetheart, I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre alright. Luckily Noah was nearby to help you,‚Äù my mom smiled, squeezing my hand. I smiled back weakly. They both left, leaving Noah alone in the room with me. I was so sleepy, fighting hard to keep my eyes open. My vision blurred again.*

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Emily.‚Äù He held my hand. ‚ÄúI never should have left you yesterday. It‚Äôs my fault you‚Äôre here.‚Äù He kept talking, but I couldn‚Äôt process the words anymore. I just nodded before drifting back into sleep.*

¬†

**END OF FLASHBACK**

¬†

‚ÄúEmily?‚Äù He shook me gently, causing me to open my eyes. I groaned and looked at him. ‚ÄúAre you going to tell me?‚Äù he smiled.

I rested my arm on his pillow, unsure what to say. ‚ÄúThe question is: what do *you* feel for me? Because there‚Äôs no point in me saying anything if it‚Äôs not mutual, you know?‚Äù I looked into his eyes, letting out a soft laugh. It was my nervousness wanting to escape the conversation quickly. I tried to project calmness in my gaze.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mutual,‚Äù he said, brushing his hand across my cheek. A chill and shiver ran down my body. Had he really said that?

‚ÄúHow can you say it‚Äôs mutual when you don‚Äôt even know how I feel? What if I hate you?‚Äù I raised an eyebrow with a teasing smile. He had to be losing it‚Äîit was probably the meds [talking.As](http://talking.As) he stroked my cheek, he gently pulled me closer, and before I even realized it, I felt his breath against mine. His gaze locked on me as he brushed my messy bangs to the side. ‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt hate me, that‚Äôs for sure,‚Äù he chuckled before kissing me. My heart raced. I had waited so long for this moment. I loved him so much, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine living without him. Life would be dull and unbearable. I had never felt anything so wonderful. I cupped his face with my hands.

He pulled back slightly and looked into my eyes. ‚ÄúEmily Rowan, I love you. I‚Äôve loved you from the very first day I saw you.‚Äù His words hit me so hard I didn‚Äôt even know how to respond. Smiling, I traced my fingers over his face and stood up from the bed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to grab a coffee, Noah.‚Äù

He caught my hand and kissed me again, sending my heart racing all over again. I pressed my lips softly to his. Pulling away, I walked toward the door, so lost in the clouds that I didn‚Äôt even see his mother walking into the room as I left.

I took the elevator down and spotted Max and Ronnie in the waiting room. As usual, Max showed up right when I needed him. He waved. I smiled back.¬†

‚ÄúEm, you‚Äôre glowing. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen you this happy,‚Äù he said, ruffling my hair as he hugged me. I laughed softly.

‚ÄúMax, I need a big favor,‚Äù I said, grabbing his hand.

His expression shifted to concern. ‚ÄúRelax, everything‚Äôs fine. I just need you to head up to Noah‚Äôs room and keep him company for a bit. His mom‚Äôs there right now, but I don‚Äôt know how long she‚Äôll stay. I‚Äôm just going to grab a coffee, okay?‚Äù He nodded. ‚ÄúWhat don‚Äôt I do for you?‚Äù he teased, kissing my cheek before heading to the elevator.

Ronnie crossed her arms and followed me to the cafeteria. ‚ÄúHow is he?‚Äù she asked eagerly. ‚ÄúDid he say anything? Tell me everything!‚Äù she tugged at my arm repeatedly.¬†

I laughed as we waited in line. ‚ÄúRonnie, calm down. He‚Äôs fine. Nothing dramatic happened, no need to panic.‚Äù

Her expression dropped from excited to disappointed.

‚ÄúOne mocha, please,‚Äù I ordered. The woman behind the counter smiled and quickly handed me the drink. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmily, when do you think he‚Äôll get discharged?‚Äù Ronnie asked as I distracted myself by sipping the mocha.

‚ÄúProbably soon. He‚Äôs doing really well.‚Äù I took another sip and left her in the waiting room.

What was happening? It felt like a dream come true. I had waited so long for this, and Noah had always meant everything to me. I was floating on air. Another sip of my mocha. I stepped out of the elevator, smiling, heading toward his room.

Suddenly, chaos erupted in the corridor. Doctors and nurses rushed around.

‚ÄúCode blue, room 429, cardiac arrest!‚Äù a nurse yelled, wheeling a defibrillator into the room.

I froze.

A sharp pain stabbed my chest. My coffee fell from my hand. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered, and started running.

I burst into the room and saw him. My eyes filled with tears. There he was, perfect, peaceful, as if he were simply sleeping, his angelic face resting on the pillow.

‚ÄúNoah!‚Äù I screamed with all my strength, launching myself toward the bed. Max caught me and held me back. Tears streamed down my face as my world collapsed. I wanted to take his place, anything but lose the boy I loved most in the world. No, this couldn‚Äôt be real. ‚ÄúNo, no...‚Äù I struggled against Max‚Äôs grip, but it was useless. The pain burned through me, consuming me from the inside out.

I heard the doctor turn to another. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt make it. Time of death. There‚Äôs nothing more we can do.‚Äù They wheeled out the bed and equipment.

‚ÄúNo. Don‚Äôt take him. No, Max, don‚Äôt let them! Not Noah.‚Äù My screams echoed through the entire floor. I was suffocating, completely numb. I tore away from Max and grabbed the bed. Several nurses ran in to pull me off.

‚ÄúLet go of me! You‚Äôre not taking him!‚Äù I slapped one of them. ‚ÄúMax, help me! They can‚Äôt do this. I know he‚Äôll wake up. He‚Äôs strong!‚Äù Max‚Äôs agonized expression said it all.

I felt a sharp prick in my arm. My strength drained away. Everything went dark.

1l5vowm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l5vowm/hot_and_cold_signals/,Hot and cold signals,"I (29F) was broken up with by someone I truly, deeply loved  (32M). It wasn‚Äôt some shallow fling. This was real. We talked about a future. We were close. He felt like home.

But recently, he ended things. He said it was an ‚Äúimpossible decision,‚Äù that he needed to detach and couldn‚Äôt keep doing this. He said he felt like he was losing himself in the relationship, he felt like he was walking on eggshells with me. He said he wasn‚Äôt holding space for a reunion ‚Äî but also said he hadn‚Äôt fallen out of love with me. That we didn‚Äôt get here bc of lack of love. 

That alone has messed with my head.

Because after he broke up with me, he:
	‚Ä¢	Told me he had lost his best friend (me).
	‚Ä¢	Said he was looking forward to trying my coffee someday when I open my shop.
	‚Ä¢	Mentioned maybe in the future‚Ä¶ if we find ourselves again. And saying he‚Äôd be thankful if that were to happen. 


And yet‚Ä¶ he also:
	‚Ä¢	Blocked me on Instagram and Facebook (even though we weren‚Äôt ‚Äúfriends‚Äù on Facebook ).
	‚Ä¢	Said he couldn‚Äôt handle seeing my profile, posts, or likes because it was too hard.
	‚Ä¢	Went completely silent not even a text about returning my stuff.
	‚Ä¢	Told me not to contact him anymore so he could have space to ‚Äúdetach and breathe.‚Äù

I‚Äôm left wondering:
If he really wanted nothing to do with me, why hasn‚Äôt he returned my things? He once told me I‚Äôll drop it off Thursday and never did, eh said he was busy with work & investor stuff‚Ä¶ I reminded him again and he said once I‚Äôm done with work and investor things‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs been 2 week and nothing about returning my stufff‚Ä¶ the things are insignificant as they‚Äôre 
Clothes. A picnic basket. Skin care. Perfume. Nothing major, but meaningful. For me it‚Äôs WHY not return them if you‚Äôre so done with me that uou can block me. 

It feels like I was left in the middle of an emotional tug-of-war with love on one side and distance on the other. And now I‚Äôm sitting here trying to figure out what was real.

He has trauma. I know that. I think he still loves me but I also think he didn‚Äôt know how to stay??? He does have a lot going on with his personal life, like work, business and his kids.

I‚Äôm grieving someone who said warm things while closing the door behind him.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? A breakup full of ‚Äúmaybes‚Äù and ‚Äúnot yets‚Äù but no real closure?
My big thing is why is he still holding on to my things? In my head I‚Äôm thinking he wants real space and then later wants to use the excuse of returning my things as an excuse to see where we‚Äôre both at? Idk I need help.

Had a slice of pizza for lunch alone, nothing else with it. Up to 130. Some up and down after that (mostly sitting or standing during this time). Measured BGM at 3:30 103. Ran 30 minutes at 3:30, drop to 74 both Stelo and BGM 4:10pm. This particular stelo is pretty spot on with BGM.

My question is could anyone interpret and explain the mechanics of what is happening in my chart during this time? 
- After pizza, spike is expected. But why does it go down then back up again twice after? Is insulin being released, then it comes back up and released again?
- After running, is this a normal and expected drop? 103 to 74 in 40 minutes?

But recently, he ended things. He said it was an ‚Äúimpossible decision,‚Äù that he needed to detach and couldn‚Äôt keep doing this. He said he felt like he was losing himself in the relationship, he felt like he was walking on eggshells with me. He said he wasn‚Äôt holding space for a reunion ‚Äî but also said he hadn‚Äôt fallen out of love with me. That we didn‚Äôt get here bc of lack of love. 

That alone has messed with my head.

Because after he broke up with me, he:
	‚Ä¢	Told me he had lost his best friend (me).
	‚Ä¢	Said he was looking forward to trying my coffee someday when I open my shop.
	‚Ä¢	Mentioned maybe in the future‚Ä¶ if we find ourselves again. And saying he‚Äôd be thankful if that were to happen. 


And yet‚Ä¶ he also:
	‚Ä¢	Blocked me on Instagram and Facebook (even though we weren‚Äôt ‚Äúfriends‚Äù on Facebook ).
	‚Ä¢	Said he couldn‚Äôt handle seeing my profile, posts, or likes because it was too hard.
	‚Ä¢	Went completely silent not even a text about returning my stuff.
	‚Ä¢	Told me not to contact him anymore so he could have space to ‚Äúdetach and breathe.‚Äù

I‚Äôm left wondering:
If he really wanted nothing to do with me, why hasn‚Äôt he returned my things? He once told me I‚Äôll drop it off Thursday and never did, eh said he was busy with work & investor stuff‚Ä¶ I reminded him again and he said once I‚Äôm done with work and investor things‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs been 2 week and nothing about returning my stufff‚Ä¶ the things are insignificant as they‚Äôre 
Clothes. A picnic basket. Skin care. Perfume. Nothing major, but meaningful. For me it‚Äôs WHY not return them if you‚Äôre so done with me that uou can block me. 

It feels like I was left in the middle of an emotional tug-of-war with love on one side and distance on the other. And now I‚Äôm sitting here trying to figure out what was real.

He has trauma. I know that. I think he still loves me but I also think he didn‚Äôt know how to stay??? He does have a lot going on with his personal life, like work, business and his kids.

I‚Äôm grieving someone who said warm things while closing the door behind him.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? A breakup full of ‚Äúmaybes‚Äù and ‚Äúnot yets‚Äù but no real closure?
My big thing is why is he still holding on to my things? In my head I‚Äôm thinking he wants real space and then later wants to use the excuse of returning my things as an excuse to see where we‚Äôre both at? Idk I need help.

In a groundbreaking move, BMW‚Äôs manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, has integrated humanoid robots into its production line. These robots, specifically the Figure 02 model from California-based Figure AI, are not just a technological marvel. They are a potential economic disruptor. The robots can perform complex tasks, such as inserting sheet metal parts with millimeter precision.
The estimated price is $30,000 per unit. Amortization costs are around $300 per month, or roughly 40 cents per hour. This is based on 24/7 operation over five years. These robots can theoretically perform any task a human can. This development raises profound questions about the future of work across multiple industries. These industries include fast food, car repair, warehousing, and even white-collar jobs. Let‚Äôs explore what this could mean. We will consider a relatable example to bring it home.
The Economics of Humanoid Robots
At $30,000, a humanoid robot‚Äôs cost can be amortized over five years. This is approximately $300 per month, or 40 cents per hour, for continuous operation (7,200 hours per year). Compare this to the U.S. federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Some state wages are higher, like $15 per hour in places such as California.
A human worker at minimum wage costs employers significantly more. This is true when factoring in benefits, taxes, and overhead. For a single employee on a 24/7 operation with multiple shifts, the cost could be $30,000 to $40,000 annually. Robots do not require breaks, sick leave, or pensions. Their operational costs are predictable and low. If these robots can truly match human versatility, their adoption could reshape industries. This includes those reliant on repetitive, manual, or even skilled labor.
Impact on the Fast Food Industry
The fast food industry is characterized by high turnover and repetitive tasks. It is ripe for disruption. Consider a typical fast food restaurant. It employs workers to take orders, prepare food, and clean. At $15 per hour, a single employee working a 40-hour week costs $31,200 annually. This excludes benefits.
A $30,000 robot, amortized at $300 per month, could handle order-taking (via voice recognition). It could also handle food prep and cleaning tasks. These tasks include mopping floors or sanitizing surfaces. A chain like McDonald‚Äôs could deploy robots to operate 24/7. This would reduce labor costs by millions across its locations. Initial investment is significant. However, the long-term savings and consistency (no human errors or no-shows) could make robots irresistible. This could lead to job losses for low-skill workers. It could potentially increase unemployment in communities reliant on fast food jobs. This would happen unless retraining programs are implemented.
Impact on the Car Repair Industry
Car repair shops rely on skilled technicians. They perform tasks such as diagnostics, tire changes, and engine repairs. A humanoid robot with human-like dexterity could perform these tasks with precision. It could access hard-to-reach areas. It could use tools as humans do. At 40 cents per hour, a robot could replace a technician earning $20‚Äì$40 per hour. This is approximately $40,000‚Äì$80,000 annually.
For a small auto shop, one or two robots could handle routine repairs. These include oil changes or brake replacements. Humans could then focus on complex diagnostics or customer service. The downside is skilled mechanics may face reduced demand. This could push them toward specialized roles or other industries. On the flip side, shops could lower prices. This would attract more customers. It could potentially offset job losses with increased business.
Impact on the Warehouse Industry
Warehouses, like those operated by Amazon or GXO, are already testing humanoid robots. These robots perform tasks like moving boxes and loading pallets. The Figure 02 robot can lift 20 kilograms. It can navigate complex environments. This makes it ideal for picking, packing, and sorting. At 40 cents per hour, robots could drastically cut costs. This is true compared to human workers earning $15‚Äì$20 per hour ($31,200‚Äì$41,600 annually).
Warehouses operate in structured environments. This is perfect for robots that thrive on repetitive tasks. Amazon‚Äôs trials with Agility Robotics‚Äô Digit robot suggest a future where robots handle most warehouse tasks. This would reduce physical strain on humans. However, it would also shrink the workforce. This could lead to fewer entry-level jobs. Though, demand for robot maintenance technicians and programmers may rise.
Impact on White-Collar Jobs
White-collar jobs may seem immune. These include accounting, data analysis, or customer service. However, robots with advanced AI could encroach here too. Imagine a humanoid robot equipped with natural language processing. It could handle customer inquiries in a call center. It could also perform data entry with flawless accuracy. At 40 cents per hour, a robot could replace a $50,000-per-year data analyst. This would save companies millions.
However, white-collar workers often handle creative, strategic, or interpersonal tasks. Robots cannot yet replicate these fully. Still, routine administrative roles are at risk. This could potentially push workers toward higher-skill jobs. These jobs would require emotional intelligence or innovation. The transition could be challenging. It would require significant upskilling.
A Relatable Example: Sarah‚Äôs Coffee Shop
To make this tangible, consider Sarah. She owns a small coffee shop. She employs three baristas at $15 per hour. They work 40-hour weeks. This costs her $93,600 annually, plus benefits. Sarah invests in two $30,000 humanoid robots. They handle order-taking, coffee preparation, and cleaning. The robots are amortized at $600 per month ($7,200 per year) for both. The robots save her over $80,000 annually.
The robots work tirelessly. They never call in sick. They deliver consistent lattes. Customers love the novelty. However, Sarah‚Äôs baristas lose their jobs. She retrains one to manage the robots and handle customer relations. The others must seek work elsewhere. This scenario illustrates both the cost savings and the human cost of robotic adoption.
Broader Implications
The introduction of humanoid robots at BMW‚Äôs Spartanburg plant signals a future. In this future, versatile, low-cost automation could transform industries. Fast food, car repair, and warehousing face immediate disruption. This is due to their reliance on repetitive or manual tasks. White-collar jobs may see slower but significant changes.
The $30,000 price tag and 40-cent-per-hour operating cost make robots economically viable. However, widespread adoption could exacerbate unemployment. This is particularly true for low-skill workers. This would happen unless society invests in retraining and education. On the positive side, robots could enhance productivity. They could lower costs. They could also improve workplace safety by handling dangerous tasks.
However, challenges remain. Humanoid robots are still in early stages. BMW‚Äôs trials show promise, but there is no set timeline for full deployment. Technical hurdles must be overcome. These include adapting robots to varied environments or ensuring safety alongside humans. Ethical questions also arise. How do we balance efficiency with job preservation? Can displaced workers transition to new roles? Governments, businesses, and educators must collaborate to prepare for this shift. This will ensure that the benefits of automation do not come at the expense of societal stability.
Conclusion
The deployment of humanoid robots at BMW‚Äôs Spartanburg plant is a glimpse into a future. In this future, machines could rival human workers in versatility and cost. For fast food, car repair, warehousing, and even white-collar jobs, the implications are profound. They promise efficiency and safety. However, they also threaten livelihoods. Sarah‚Äôs coffee shop shows how this technology could reshape small businesses. It amplifies both opportunities and challenges. As humanoid robots evolve, society must navigate this transformation carefully. We must leverage their potential while mitigating their impact on workers. The road ahead is exciting but uncertain. The choices we make now will shape the workforce of tomorrow.

1l5vbwi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l5vbwi,How I keep Cursor operate with more autonomy (ex: implementing cursor deeplinks for my mcp server),"(i wrote this up a few days ago when deeplinks launched but forgot to hit post. figured I'd still share, hopefully it's still topical!)  
  
I develop an MCP server call Ref [https://ref.tools](https://ref.tools) that helps gives coding agents like Cursor access to up-to-date API docs. I started building this a few months ago when I found my coding agents hallucinating APIs and details that are facts they really should just know. I found this especially annoying in AI-world where new amazing stuff launches every week üòÖ

I was stoked to see that Cursor launched deeplinks to install MCP servers with one-click. Asking users to configure a fiddly json files is the most annoy about distributing an MCP server so I really hope other MCP clients adopt this approach! As soon as I saw launch I knew it was gonna be the first thing for me to work on today and figured I'd share it here.

The ideal agent workflow is to casual stroll to my desk with my coffee, read the tweet about one-click mcp install and dictate to my AI ""please implement 1-click install to Cursor with deeplink"". So that's what I tried and the screenshots are attached. Without Ref, Claude confidently and wrongly guesses the deeplink url path which is totally expected because it's not in the training corpus. With Ref it just gets it an we can move on.

I'm not trying to claim this revolutionizes anything lol but I've found it greases the wheels and things just go a little bit faster and smoother so I'm excited to share. Especially now I'm using background Claude Codes all the time without a max plan, having Ref get just the right tokens rather than thousands of extra ones and guiding the model out of wrong parts of the decision tree saves $.

To preempt a few questions:

*Couldn't you just paste the link to the docs?*

Obviously yes. The point is that you shouldn't need to. This is a toy topical example with a single link but often you need to gather multiple sets of docs. If you're interested in a larger more realistic example, here's a case study on Ref helping Cursor migrate my Firebase backend to Turbopuffer. [https://ref.tools/use-case/turbopuffer](https://ref.tools/use-case/turbopuffer)

*Why not use web search?*

Yes, this is a web search option! Why not use a web search index that's faster and tuned specifically to the type of search you're making?

*What about the @ Docs feature?*

By all means! But wouldn't it be nicer to never have to manually curate your docs, not have to worry about failed crawls and have it just work?

Anyways, thanks for checking it out! I'm a solo dev just trying to build something useful so appreciate any feedback. And if you decide to try Ref in Cursor, its only 1-click away :)",1,1749330688.0,mcp,0,1.0,False

Trying to get some perspective on a potential move from CPW (currently) to Riverside Drive. We‚Äôre looking to upgrade for more space primarily. Initially I wasn‚Äôt interested in leaving CPW because we‚Äôve become so adapted to being near the park and we gain a lot of convenience being so close to Whole Foods, traders joes, coffee shops, subway stop.

It‚Äôs looking like we can get more bang for our buck on Riverside Dr. We recently checked out a few units in the 80s and the area feels very quaint and peaceful. My concern is whether it feels a bit too isolated and removed from convenience. Daily errands like grocery shopping, coffee runs, getting downtown in a jiff - how accessible do these activities feel without having to walk over 10-15 mins? Want to make sure the lifestyle factor makes sense in a potential move. 

Any and all perspective is appreciated!

Background; I used to work with a girl, we‚Äôll call her Ann. Me, Ann and another girl, Elle, were thick as thieves. A trio of good friends. I loved this because I started that job a few years before and never seemed to get along with anyone until I met these girls when I was moved teams. I loved this also because I didn‚Äôt have many friends at the time and I was very lonely at my job. Despite not having a lot in common, we got along well. We met outside of work often also.

Years passed and we got closer until me and Elle were promoted to different departments and Ann left for a different job after she had a baby. We understandably grew apart a bit but had coffee every once in a while. When we did I always said we needed to do it more often but it was often difficult because right now they both have children so I understood and I‚Äôve never been bitter when they couldn‚Äôt do anything when I asked.

About two years ago Ann got engaged. I was so happy for her and wished her the best. I didn‚Äôt think much about it until a few months ago I got a Snapchat message from Ann. It was a save the date for her wedding, July of this year. I replied something along the lines of ‚ÄòYay, I can‚Äôt wait!‚Äô and we had a short conversation. I never expected to be part of the wedding party or invited to her bachelorette party. Ann has a much larger support system and group of friends than me and at this point I just thought that me and Elle would be attending as normal guests.

A few weeks ago Ann had her bachelorette party. I saw it on Facebook and saw she had a Harry Potter theme (something we bonded over) so I looked through the pictures. One picture I saw was the whole group who attended and smack dab in the middle was Ann and Elle. I felt a bit hurt. Like I said, I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be invited but I was wondering why Elle would be. They always seemed like they were as estranged as I felt when we met for coffee. Writing this all out now, I feel a bit childish but I can‚Äôt help but feel left out. I helped them through so much like relationship troubles, family troubles, I was one of the first people Ann told she was pregnant ffs. I thought my friendship meant as much to them as it did to me but I guess I was wrong. I‚Äôm considering not going to the wedding now. At this point I feel like I‚Äôve been invited out of pity or something. 

More happened this week though. I got a message from Ann saying that she is going to deliver invitations, for her July wedding, and wanted to know if I was home. I wasn‚Äôt but told her to put it in the letterbox. I didn‚Äôt get it. It was days and it didn‚Äôt come. I didn‚Äôt want to bother her about it. Then I got a message from her saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be bothered to deliver the invitations so here‚Äôs a digital copy‚Äù and sent two pictures of her invitation‚Ä¶through a Snapchat message. I was a bit pissed off but I accepted it.

Now on to today, I see that there is a SECOND bachelorette party (she had a destination and home one). Even better, Elle and another girl we used to work with it are there (who they both said they never liked), EVEN BETTER, they are at a bar that me and other friends are going to tonight.

I don‚Äôt know what to do it I run into them, I‚Äôm even considering just not trying with them anymore. And I‚Äôm considering not going to the wedding. I need advice.

I confided in my boyfriend about this who has been supportive and said he supports whatever I decide but I‚Äôm just at a loss.

The staff ( both the FD and the Atrio Restaurant) we all very kind and amazing. We used our $50 credits ( $25 pp pn) from the Diamond + the $50 ( from the gf‚Äôs Surpass)! all at the restaurant for amazing breakfast!

Would stay again 10/10

Protip: They seemed to serve free black
coffee at the entry to the restaurant for all guests. I realised this after I had ordered the $8 coffee during breakfast lol

**Sandbox and Customization: Unprecedented Scope**  
In *Starfield*, you can once again recruit people to staff your outposts‚Äîbut this time, you‚Äôll need to visit bars in major spaceport cities to handpick the talent you need. These recruitable NPCs aren‚Äôt just nameless functionaries; some come with full names, distinct life experiences, and personal backstories.

*Starfield* also features a crew management interface that feels somewhat reminiscent of *Fallout Shelter* or even *FTL: Faster Than Light*, where you can assign personnel between your ship and your outposts according to their deployment status and skills. These hires don‚Äôt just fill roles‚Äîthey provide tangible gameplay buffs for your ship and stations.

Those who know me may recall my previous content, such as *Wasteland Engineer*‚Äîa showcase video of my ‚ÄúUltimate Wasteland Sanctuary,‚Äù meticulously built over a hundred hours. I‚Äôve also always been a huge fan of games like *The Sims*, *Cities: Skylines*, and *Minecraft*.

Bethesda‚Äôs modern RPG philosophy‚Äîthough it hasn‚Äôt quite reached perfection‚Äîhas long represented my dream vision for the ultimate video game format. It aspires toward something I deeply resonate with.

While I adore sandbox games, I‚Äôve always felt that the genre, at least for me, lacks a truly grounded world. It often misses the rich foundation built by hundreds of quests and characters. I feel a powerful sense of ownership and pride in the things I build, but that subtle immersive quality‚Äîthe feeling of truly *living* in a believable virtual world‚Äîis often absent.

https://preview.redd.it/jeyqil58kk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00025dc8deaec526353d145971152bf047c588a4

On the flip side, my other favorite genre‚ÄîRPGs, particularly Western-style RPGs (WRPGs)‚Äîexcel at immersion through rich storytelling, meaningful choices, and character depth. Yet few WRPGs offer me that grounded, homegrown feeling of *belonging* within the world. They give me amazing adventure snapshots, but rarely a persistent world I can settle into.

If I were to invent my own genre label, I‚Äôd say Bethesda‚Äôs modern RPGs‚Äîespecially starting with *Fallout 4*‚Äîare SBRPGs: Sandbox Role-Playing Games. They‚Äôre pioneers of a hybrid genre that merges open-ended simulation with RPG depth. Titles like *Fable* might also fit this category in spirit.

https://preview.redd.it/xr2e8khijk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fc2039c7bddf98c9a279174aaa5c04c865557ae

Put more bluntly, we‚Äôre talking about a single-player open world that fuses WRPG mechanics with life simulation and sandbox freedom.

At its core, sandbox design means the player has the ability to *shape the world*. You can build or create freely, without mandatory objectives or railroading.

Take *Minecraft*, for instance‚Äîan iconic sandbox title. It offers unparalleled creative freedom but lacks the intricate, narrative-rich world of an RPG. There‚Äôs no layered lore or compelling characters to interact with, which makes it harder to feel immersed. I build cities there, sure‚Äîbut they often feel disconnected from me. Imagination fills the gap, but compared to a WRPG, it lacks interactivity.

Now let‚Äôs flip the coin. Most WRPGs don‚Äôt give players sandbox mechanics. Forget building your own settlement‚Äîeven decorating a small room is rare.

For me, what makes a game world feel *advanced* and worth belonging to is simple: **Can I do what I want to do?**

https://preview.redd.it/yzf0ima2kk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a49952fdd08c1d8089bdbdfbb460be47e67a879

How much a game lets‚Äîor doesn‚Äôt let‚Äîyou do the things *you personally* care about has a massive (and very subjective) impact on immersion. Some players care most about combat depth. Others prioritize dialogue options.

For me, immersion is the harmony of *interactivity* and *belonging*. Sandbox systems offer strong belonging.

Home is a haven. People always need a place they can call their own. In games, whether I can build and decorate my own home is often the deciding factor between a story I merely *experience*‚Ä¶ and a life I truly *live*.

In my previous videos on *Skyrim* and *Fallout 4*, I‚Äôve said that my ideal open world isn‚Äôt just a large map to explore or a rich backdrop for storytelling. My dream is an open world that feels like a living, breathing space I can *exist* in. A virtual world that supports immersion through life itself.

No life, no world.

**The Fusion of Bethesda-Style Sandbox and RPG: Deep Systems of Resources and Outposts**  
When it comes to specific systems, *Starfield* makes significant progress over *Fallout 4*, which marked Bethesda‚Äôs first foray into sandbox mechanics. The gameplay loop surrounding outposts has seen a substantial evolution.

Not only does *Starfield* retain the freeform XYZ-axis object placement system, it also introduces a full gameplay loop centered around the game‚Äôs three primary currencies‚Äî**Credits**, **Resources**, and **XP**‚Äîin a closed cycle.

https://preview.redd.it/qqb6dvhmjk5f1.jpg?width=1429&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=770c0751fd7c0a1c189dfe30b765154b2ffba1ac

Let‚Äôs talk about *Starfield*‚Äôs resource system in more detail. It stands apart from both *The Elder Scrolls*, where most miscellaneous items have no systemic function, and *Fallout*, where virtually every scrap can be broken down for crafting.

*Starfield* strikes a middle ground. Some items, like in *TES*, serve no systemic purpose. But others can be used as crafting materials, creating a unique gameplay loop that sets *Starfield* apart as the third pillar in Bethesda‚Äôs portfolio.

*Starfield*‚Äôs outposts are fully integrated into all three of the player‚Äôs major resource cycles. While *Fallout 4* had something similar in concept, *Starfield* goes much further in terms of resource output efficiency, system depth, and build customization. Skills, personnel assignments, and facility synergies combine to offer a level of complexity that simply wasn‚Äôt there before.

https://preview.redd.it/6v9tyoinjk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e444582e1584459f2c608c24d346aa109cf0b8a

Since *Starfield* doesn‚Äôt take place in a post-apocalyptic setting like *Fallout 4*, outposts are primarily industrial hubs focused on production and resource management. Unlike the basic output from *Fallout 4*‚Äôs scavenging stations or farming plots, *Starfield*‚Äôs extractors operate with far greater efficiency and can be further enhanced by adding production robots and well-suited personnel.

Additionally, the simple two-way supply lines of *Fallout 4* have evolved into a dedicated logistics system. Borrowing ideas from factory-building games, *Starfield* introduces true conveyor-style production chains. Players must design real, functioning logistics networks‚Äîautomated production pipelines that bring unprecedented depth to the resource system.

On Reddit, user Mattgyvercom went so far as to create an entire ‚ÄúStarfield Advanced Reactor Production Guide,‚Äù hand-drawing every warehouse, resource node, manufacturing unit, and logistic link in his production chain.

https://preview.redd.it/6iuh2amojk5f1.jpg?width=1432&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98acf7e54b6dbd61cd1dabebf57d07730b3d2db9

This revamped resource system brings with it not just mechanical depth, but a rewarding gameplay loop tied directly to currency generation.

If you manage to achieve full automation of ‚ÄúFuel Rods‚Äù‚Äîcurrently the most expensive industrial component in the game‚Äîyou‚Äôve basically reached the endgame for in-game currency. You just need to visit your terminal outpost regularly and crank out fuel rods at the Industrial Workbench. At that point, you‚Äôre swimming in Credits, Resources, and XP.

These high-tier resources‚Äîincluding some slightly lower-tier than the Va‚Äôruun rods‚Äîare valuable enough to sustain an entire loop of reward and progression.

Right now, I‚Äôm still working my way toward ‚ÄúFuel Rod‚Äù freedom‚Äîbut I‚Äôve at least achieved ‚ÄúIndium Wafer‚Äù freedom. Still far from optimal efficiency.

Yet even with all these new mechanics, my primary reason for building outposts in *Starfield* remains the same‚Äîand possibly even more meaningful than before.

https://preview.redd.it/gmks7893kk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ba713955b6972bea669e86d75e3425e53a69901

**From Functional Bases to Narrative Homes**

For example, this is my Indium Wafer factory. Once I achieved ‚ÄúIndium Wafer freedom,‚Äù I started outfitting it with various mods to create a finely detailed factory, complete with industrial equipment, workshops, and decorative elements.

Beyond factories, *Starfield* also lets players build farms and ranches. On the extremely rare, gold‚Äëclass world of Bor II‚Äîwhere every species can be bred‚ÄîI‚Äôve set up my largest agricultural base yet. At this scale, it‚Äôs practically an agricultural town.

https://preview.redd.it/6qb2j1osjk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d885160f1657f01a5cd8c9fc8527db74de2a7484

You can plant any flora marked as outpost‚Äëusable, and breed any creature tagged for ranching.

Say hello to my alien swamp dog‚Äëcrocodiles!

But what I really want to talk about is ‚ÄúGuanghan City‚Äù‚Äîmy settlement comparable to my Fallout 4 Sanctuary outpost‚Äîthis time an entire city on the Moon.

Here‚Äôs a bit of lore I wrote for Guanghan City: It‚Äôs a lunar colony city built by the Starborn Organization. It‚Äôs the second most important city in the United Colonies after Citadel Station. Originally a research facility converted into a fortified colony, you can still see the old mega‚Äëturrets outside.

In 2330, the Starborn Organization discovered clues about an artifact on the Moon and started construction. Through connections fostered by a mysterious figure called the ‚ÄúMiner Kid,‚Äù the site grew from Quiet Sea Command Center into a fully functioning city‚Äîcomplete with a spaceport, mega‚Äëfreight terminal, cemetery, ruins district, and residential sector.

https://preview.redd.it/9fna5abwjk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03542a3043fefff27402dfa147479dc5b4af77c3

Like *The Sims* cheat console, *Bethesda* games have always included a built‚Äëin console for building‚Äëmode functions like setscale and modpos. In *Starfield*, you can use these tools to control XYZ placement and scaling‚Äîpowerful for creating unique outpost appearances. That mod‚Äëfriendly, UGC‚Äëfocused philosophy is just as strong here.

https://preview.redd.it/v9s74j29kk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fac62f91c7bce72f96d5d31efc0e7c3835c56fdd

Guanghan City is where I unleash creativity and cultivate belonging. I built cozy staff quarters and a cafeteria, added workshops and med bays with their own narrative, and assigned named chefs and doctors. In the future, the spaceport area will house shops like ‚ÄúEarth Classic Coffee‚Äù Guanghan City branch.

Whenever I look at the Quiet Sea Command Center, I remember the night it began. It was my first module on the Moon, once intended as a personal residence (before moving to New Atlantis). It evolved into a civic administrative hub.

https://preview.redd.it/yuuj0gjxjk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3ea01e420d019615264e635b50adfd1253afa91

Even though it‚Äôs changed dramatically, I still recall sitting with Sarah on a simple sofa under moonlight, the model shuttle on the coffee table catching a shaft of light that night.

Years before *Starfield*‚Äôs release, the title was leaked. Since then, I‚Äôve often spoken about my expectations for a Bethesda space RPG‚Äîespecially one game I thought would finally realize my dream:

I wanted to stand on the lunar mare, watch the Sun rise on the horizon, see Earth hanging overhead, and alongside a loved one or comrade familiar through life‚Äëor‚Äëdeath quests, build a home in a rich, detailed world‚Äîand live a space-bound life of my own.

*Starfield* did exactly that. For my personal hopes for a space RPG that grants control over narrative and pacing, it‚Äôs both the summit and the only game I‚Äôve found to reach it.

2018 me:  
‚ÄúDo you see that moon? It‚Äôs beautiful.‚Äù

2023 me:  
‚ÄúDo you see that moon? I not only went there‚ÄîI built a city on it and decorated a home for people I recruited.‚Äù

Meanwhile, my other city‚Äëscale settlement, Tokyo Undercity, is part of the United Colonies‚Äô ‚ÄúRevitalize Old Quarters‚Äù plan. It will soon join Guanghan City to form a metro‚Äëarea akin to ‚ÄúNew Atlantis‚ÄìGagarin.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/23nc9lkyjk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaceb8ab4d510d5b07777f884210c4bd4c573fe0

Fueled by nostalgia for Earth and the revealed truth of the Great Exodus, companies like Longshen Industrial, Oishi Foods, and Cosmos Nova have announced investments. United Colonies officials say this supports prosperity within the Nalian Treaty zone and strengthens settlement efforts in the star system.

**My Final Home: The Skyline Penthouse, New Atlantis**

Finally, let‚Äôs talk about where I settled: the penthouse suite of Skyline, in New Atlantis. It‚Äôs the best Bethesda residence I‚Äôve had since the Solitude Manor in *Skyrim: Anniversary Edition*.

https://preview.redd.it/o4vh5nu0kk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e14bc6916fe6685ef70902167c32a405cb46125d

I meticulously decorated every space‚Äîbalcony, bedroom, bathroom, workshop, kitchen, dining room, workroom‚Äîwith objects I scavenged around the galaxy, even creating a small scene narrative on Andrea‚Äôs bedside table.

https://preview.redd.it/4fryfqx4kk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=320986148f318423104c1a33387a29020fdfa300

It‚Äôs not just a fixed home, nor equipment builds. *Starfield* also added something Bethesda and most sci‚Äëfi RPGs never had before: full ship customization.

In *Starfield*, you can use these tools to control XYZ placement and scaling‚Äîpowerful for creating unique outpost appearances. That mod‚Äëfriendly, UGC‚Äëfocused philosophy is just as strong here.

Guanghan City is where I unleash creativity and cultivate belonging. I built cozy staff quarters and a cafeteria, added workshops and med bays with their own narrative, and assigned named chefs and doctors. In the future, the spaceport area will house shops like ‚ÄúEarth Classic Coffee‚Äù Guanghan City branch.

Whenever I look at the Quiet Sea Command Center, I remember the night it began. It was my first module on the Moon, once intended as a personal residence (before moving to New Atlantis). It evolved into a civic administrative hub.

Even though it‚Äôs changed dramatically, I still recall sitting with Sarah on a simple sofa under moonlight, the model shuttle on the coffee table catching a shaft of light that night.

Years before *Starfield*‚Äôs release, the title was leaked. Since then, I‚Äôve often spoken about my expectations for a Bethesda space RPG‚Äîespecially one game I thought would finally realize my dream:

I wanted to stand on the lunar mare, watch the Sun rise on the horizon, see Earth hanging overhead, and alongside a loved one or comrade familiar through life‚Äëor‚Äëdeath quests, build a home in a rich, detailed world‚Äîand live a space-bound life of my own.

*Starfield* did exactly that. For my personal hopes for a space RPG that grants control over narrative and pacing, it‚Äôs both the summit and the only game I‚Äôve found to reach it.

2018 me:  
‚ÄúDo you see that moon? It‚Äôs beautiful.‚Äù

2023 me:  
‚ÄúDo you see that moon? I not only went there‚ÄîI built a city on it and decorated a home for people I recruited.‚Äù

Meanwhile, my other city‚Äëscale settlement, Tokyo Undercity, is part of the United Colonies‚Äô ‚ÄúRevitalize Old Quarters‚Äù plan. It will soon join Guanghan City to form a metro‚Äëarea akin to ‚ÄúNew Atlantis‚ÄìGagarin.‚Äù

Fueled by nostalgia for Earth and the revealed truth of the Great Exodus, companies like Longshen Industrial, Oishi Foods, and Cosmos Nova have announced investments. United Colonies officials say this supports prosperity within the Nalian Treaty zone and strengthens settlement efforts in the star system.

**My Final Home: The Skyline Penthouse, New Atlantis**

Finally, let‚Äôs talk about where I settled: the penthouse suite of Skyline, in New Atlantis. It‚Äôs the best Bethesda residence I‚Äôve had since the Solitude Manor in *Skyrim: Anniversary Edition*.

https://preview.redd.it/o4vh5nu0kk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e14bc6916fe6685ef70902167c32a405cb46125d

I meticulously decorated every space‚Äîbalcony, bedroom, bathroom, workshop, kitchen, dining room, workroom‚Äîwith objects I scavenged around the galaxy, even creating a small scene narrative on Andrea‚Äôs bedside table.

https://preview.redd.it/4fryfqx4kk5f1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=320986148f318423104c1a33387a29020fdfa300

It‚Äôs not just a fixed home, nor equipment builds. *Starfield* also added something Bethesda and most sci‚Äëfi RPGs never had before: full ship customization.

1l5v33j,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1l5v33j/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

## Key features Analysis

the selection of an upholstered coffee table depends on a combination of factors that influence its style, functionality, and lasting value.

**Construction and Frame:** The structural integrity of an upholstered coffee table is paramount. Tables with solid wood frames, such as hardwood or reinforced plywood, are generally more durable and capable of supporting substantial weight. Cheaper alternatives often use particleboard or MDF,which can be less resistant to wear and tear.

The stability and longevity of an upholstered coffee table heavily rely on its frame. solid wood frames, particularly those crafted from hardwood or reinforced plywood, are highly recommended for homeowners seeking durability and long-term value. These materials offer superior resistance to warping, cracking, and general wear, ensuring the table can withstand daily use. Tables with solid wood frames can hold more weight and will be less prone to damage.

**Upholstery Material:** Fabric choice greatly affects the table's aesthetic appeal and durability. Popular options include genuine leather, faux leather (PU or PVC), velvet, linen, and various synthetic blends. Leather offers a luxurious look and is relatively easy to clean but can be prone to scratches and fading. Velvet provides a soft, plush feel but may require more meticulous maintenance. Linen and synthetic blends are generally more affordable and resistant to stains, making them suitable for high-traffic areas.

The upholstery material is crucial and should be selected based on your lifestyle and aesthetic preferences. Genuine leather provides a luxurious feel and is frequently enough easier to clean but can be more susceptible to scratches and fading over time. Faux leather is a more budget-friendly alternative that is resistant to stains and fading. Velvet offers a soft and plush feel but can be challenging to clean and maintain. Linen and synthetic blends come in various colors and patterns, offering durability and stain resistance ideal for busy households.

**Size and Dimensions:** The coffee table's size should be proportional to the surrounding furniture and the room's dimensions. A too-small table may look inadequate,while an oversized one can overwhelm the space. Measure the available area and consider the height relative to the seating. A height slightly below the sofa seat is generally ideal for comfortable use.Choosing the right size of a coffee table is crucial for both functionality and aesthetics. Consider the dimensions of your living room and the surrounding furniture to ensure the table complements the space. Smaller living rooms benefit from compact tables that don't overwhelm the area, while larger spaces can accommodate larger, more statement-making pieces. A coffee table should typically be around one to two-thirds the length of your sofa. The height of the coffee table should be about the same height as, or slightly lower than, your sofa or seating.

**Padding and Cushioning:** The comfort of an upholstered coffee table is determined by the quality and density of its padding. High-density foam provides better support and maintains its shape longer than low-density options. Some tables also incorporate springs or webbing for added comfort and resilience.

The cushions and padding employed in the design of an upholstered coffee table are key contributors to its comfort and durability. Opt for coffee tables that features high-density foam padding. High-density foam will maintain its shape and provide adequate support over time,preventing sagging and ensuring lasting comfort.Springs or webbed suspension systems are also beneficial, as they enhance the table‚Äôs ability to absorb weight and movement, increasing its overall comfort and lifespan.

Key features of upholstered coffee tables include:

*   High-quality upholstery
*   Durable frame construction
*   Proper size and dimensions
*   Comfortable padding and cushioning

I‚Äôve always taken the subway.

That‚Äôs just how it goes for most people in New York City. Cars can drain your wallet, and it's not worth it for someone like me who doesn‚Äôt have cash to spare or the patience for the hassle of alternate-side parking. Having a car here feels less like a ticket to freedom and more like a burden. According to Google, about half the city‚Äôs residents feel the same way. Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs not a bigger number. Just dealing with traffic can age you a decade. I‚Äôve watched cabs sit through a single red light cycle three times without budging an inch.

Of course, it‚Äôs not all smooth sailing and neatly folded newspapers. The MTA has its fair share of madness. Delays, reroutes, those mysterious ‚Äútrain traffic ahead‚Äù announcements, and the people. Not everyone is a problem. Most of us are just trying to get from point A to point B with our headphones in and our eyes down.¬†

But then there are the others, the quirky ones. The subway performers who treat the A train like it‚Äôs their stage at the Apollo. The cat-callers who think shouting a compliment across a crowded car is the way to someone‚Äôs heart. The folks sprawled across three seats, deep in slumber. And then there are the homeless, many quietly navigating life underground, blending into the scenery, while others make their presence felt in ways that are hard to overlook.

It‚Äôs a lot to take in. It can be overwhelming. It used to be for me.

I didn‚Äôt grow up here. My family moved to the city when I was seventeen, right in the middle of junior year. We came from a small town in Pennsylvania, the kind of place where doors are left unlocked and everyone waves, whether they know you or not. But my mom was ready for a change. She craved a fresh start, something bigger and louder than the quiet life we‚Äôd been living. I think the city was more of a distraction for her than anything else.

So we packed up what we could, sold off what we couldn‚Äôt, and ended up in a tiny, third-floor walk-up. That first year was a tough one. The city felt alive, like it had its own heartbeat, always bustling and demanding something from you. But as time went on, I started to find my rhythm. The clattering of the trains, the cadence of the announcements, and the way you begin to recognize familiar faces during your morning commute, even if you never exchange a word with them.

Now, the subway feels like a second home. A peculiar kind of sanctuary between my actual home. Sure, it‚Äôs not perfect. It‚Äôs gritty, unpredictable, and can be downright frustrating at times, but it‚Äôs real. And in a city like this, sometimes that‚Äôs the best you can hope for.

Today felt like just another ordinary day.

I work one of those classic office jobs, you know the drill. Beige cubicles, flickering fluorescent lights, and coffee that tastes more like regret than anything remotely caffeinated. It‚Äôs not glamorous, but it pays the bills. Honestly, I don‚Äôt mind it. There‚Äôs a certain comfort in the routine. I‚Äôve never been the ‚Äúfollow your passion‚Äù type anyway.

¬†Passion seems like a luxury for those who don‚Äôt have to stress about rent, groceries, or whether their MetroCard has enough balance. For someone like me, a job that asks for exactly what I‚Äôm willing to give. nothing more, nothing less. Feels just right.

So, as usual, I clocked out after a long day, grabbed my well-worn suitcase, more of a work bag, really, but it‚Äôs taken enough hits to deserve the title, and threw on my coat. It was one of those early spring days when the weather can‚Äôt seem to decide what it wants to be. The sky was thick with clouds, but the air felt warm. I remember thinking I might have overdressed. Again.

The subway station was busier than usual. I could feel the day‚Äôs fatigue creeping in as I navigated through clusters of tourists clutching maps like they were trying to conjure a spirit. A group of them had gathered in front of the MetroCard machines, blissfully unaware they were blocking the entire entrance. I muttered an ‚Äúexcuse me,‚Äù knowing it would probably go unheard, and slipped past them with the quiet efficiency of someone who‚Äôs done this dance a thousand times.

I managed to find an empty spot on a bench, next to a guy who clearly was in the same predicament as me, just wanting to go home. He sat slouched over, tie loosened, eyes glazed in that universal post-9-to-5 stare. I pulled out my phone and started scrolling. News, social feeds, the same stream of curated distraction I‚Äôd scrolled through that morning. Nothing new, nothing exciting. Just the hypnotic flicker of blue light against my face.

The station hummed with a low mechanical groan, the kind that seeps into your bones if you stand still long enough. A saxophone echoed faintly from somewhere down the platform, its player hidden behind a row of pillars. The music was slow, mournful, something that might‚Äôve been soulful if not for the flat notes and tinny reverb.

The overhead lights flickered once, briefly, and I felt my eyelids droop. The kind of droop that comes not just from exhaustion, but from routine, bone-deep familiarity with a world that never quite changes. The same gum-stained tiles, the same peeling advertisements promising miracle diets and dubious lawyers, the same stale underground air tinged with hot metal and too many people in too small a space.

I blinked slowly. My phone sagged in my grip. Maybe it was the warmth of the tunnel, or the way the concrete seemed to hum in time with my heartbeat, but a fog started creeping in behind my eyes. A subtle pounding, dull but persistent, started at the base of my skull and worked its way forward. Not quite a migraine yet, but close. That hazy, unreal feeling where everything seems too far away or too close at once.

I shifted on the bench, adjusted the strap of my bag, and tried to focus on something, anything. A child across the platform was swinging his legs, counting tiles. An older woman tapped her cane rhythmically as if keeping time to some internal metronome. The train was late, of course.

My head dipped forward for just a moment. Or at least, I thought it was a moment. The next thing I knew, I was waking up with a start, heart thudding, phone sliding from my lap.

I quickly grabbed it before it could fall. My fingers wrapped around the phone just in time, its smooth surface slick with the sweat of my palm. I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, letting my heart settle back into a more reasonable rhythm. The jolt had shaken off the last of my drowsiness, but something else had replaced it, an uneasy stillness. I glanced around, blinking hard.

The station was empty.

Startlingly, unnaturally empty.

The bench beside me, where the tired man had been sitting, was now vacant. The tourists, the child counting tiles, the old woman with the cane,gone. Every single person had vanished. No more quiet chatter, no more shuffling feet. The distant hum of the saxophone had stopped. Even the ever-present whoosh of air from passing tunnels was absent. The silence pressed against my ears like cotton, thick and disorienting.

My first thought was that I had fallen asleep for hours and missed the crowds, missed the rush. But that didn‚Äôt explain the silence. The subway never slept, not completely. There was always someone, always noise. Always something.

Confused, I moved to check the time on my phone. The screen stayed black. I pressed the power button once, twice, nothing. No buzz, no flicker. It was like the phone had simply died, or forgotten how to be a phone. I turned it over in my hands, wondering if the battery had given out. But it hadn‚Äôt felt like it was dying before I nodded off. And still‚Ä¶ It felt warm. Too warm.¬†

I sighed, my breath louder than it should‚Äôve been in the silent station, and slowly stood. The sound of my coat shifting, the scuff of my shoe against the platform, all echoed more than they should. My bag tugged at my shoulder as I adjusted it. The concrete underfoot suddenly felt less stable, like I was balancing on something too smooth, too polished to be part of a subway system that was never cleaned enough.

That‚Äôs when I heard it: the distant metallic screech of a train on the tracks, growing louder by the second. I turned toward the tunnel. Headlights cut through the darkness, spilling yellow beams that flickered as they passed over stray bits of trash and the tiled walls.

The train was slowing. Coming to a stop.

The front car hissed as it aligned with the platform, the doors sighing open in a mechanical exhale. I waited for someone to step out. No one did. No conductor visible. No passengers. The interior lights flickered, weak, sickly fluorescents that buzzed like an old ceiling fixture in a basement no one visited anymore.

I hesitated, my instincts buzzing now in a different way, telling me this didn‚Äôt make sense, that I should wait for the next one, that something about this was off. But logic took over. I told myself I‚Äôd simply take this train to my stop. Maybe this was one of those weird off-hours when everything just feels strange. Maybe there had been a power surge, and that‚Äôs why the phone was dead. Maybe I was just tired and overthinking it all.

I stepped closer, boots thudding softly against the concrete as I approached the open doors. They creaked apart slowly, like jaws easing open for a meal. Above the door, the flickering orange letters of the Destination Sign glowed through the gloom:

*‚ÄúLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.‚Äù*

It scrolled, paused, then repeated.

*‚ÄúLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.‚Äù*

I squinted at it, confused. The words were unfamiliar, clearly not English, but close enough to make me think I should know them. ‚ÄúSpanish?‚Äù I wondered. ‚ÄúItalian, maybe? Latin?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know. Whatever it was, it didn‚Äôt seem to be a station name, and definitely not one I recognized from the usual route.¬†

I shrugged to myself. I didn‚Äôt speak Spanish, at least, that‚Äôs what I assumed it was ,and besides, it didn‚Äôt matter. I was tired. I was cold. I just wanted to get home.

The doors finished opening with a heavy thunk that echoed down the empty station.

I stepped on.

The moment I crossed the threshold, a strange sensation washed over me, like I‚Äôd walked through a membrane of cold air, colder than the platform, almost like a refrigerated room. A shiver climbed my spine. I pulled my jacket tighter around me, trying not to look too long at the sterile glow of the fluorescent lights overhead.

Once again, the car was empty. Too empty. Not the lived-in kind of empty, not the kind that follows a morning rush or a late-night lull. This was something else. The seats were spotless, almost clinically so. The air was unmoving, stale but not from use, like it had been trapped in here for too long. Even the hum of the train's systems sounded muted, muffled somehow.

I picked a seat near the middle, my fingers gripping the plastic edge for balance. The cold seeped through my jacket, into my hands, into my bones. I let out a long breath, watching it fog slightly in front of my face.

I sat. I held my bag close.

I told myself this was just a weird delay, an alternate route, an old car maybe, something forgotten in the system but still functional. Nothing to worry about.

But my reflection in the window didn't seem convinced. The glass was too dark, too slow to catch up. I shifted slightly, and it lagged a fraction of a second behind, as though unsure whether to follow me at all.

The doors hissed shut behind me, sealing with an almost ceremonial finality. The train jolted forward, moving into the tunnel. No conductor‚Äôs voice came over the intercom. No rumbling announcement of the next stop.

Just that whisper of motion. That chill in the air.

And that sign, still blinking, still repeating, on the far end of the car:

‚ÄúLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.‚Äù

I sat for a moment, hugging my coat tighter, the chill gnawing at my skin. The rhythmic clatter of the train against the tracks was the only sound now, a dull, mechanical heartbeat echoing through the car. I stared at the floor, at the speckled plastic between my boots, until something caught my eye outside the window.

Movement.

I turned my head slowly.

People.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, or my eyes playing games after the nap and the dim glow of the car. But no, it was unmistakable. Just outside the train, barely feet away, people were walking alongside it.

I gasped and bolted upright, pressing my face closer to the glass. The chill from the window stung my skin. The train hadn‚Äôt stopped ;¬† it was still moving, but so were they. A silent procession, keeping perfect pace. Dozens of them. Maybe more.

They walked not on a platform, but on something else, something dark and indistinct. The backdrop behind them was black, as if the tunnel had dissolved into a void. No walls, no lights, no signs. Just figures moving in lockstep with the train.

They didn‚Äôt look at me. They didn‚Äôt look at anything.

Their expressions were blank. Not peaceful, empty. Eyes open, unfocused. Mouths shut. No signs of communication, no hint that they even knew each other. Some were dressed in business suits, others in t-shirts, nightgowns, and uniforms. A teenager shuffled by wearing a backpack. An old woman in a house robe. A child with no shoes. A man in a soaked parka that dripped even though there was no rain.

No common thread, no reason, just people. All kinds of people.

And they were all walking in the same direction, right beside me, staring forward into nothing.

I felt my breath catch in my throat. My fingers trembled as they gripped the edge of the seat. I couldn‚Äôt look away. My brain raced to make sense of it. Some kind of art installation? A window to another train? A hallucination?

But they were too close. Too real. I could see the subtle sway of their steps, the twitch of a hand here, a loose thread blowing slightly there.

Finally, I sat back down, the seat creaking softly beneath me. I kept my eyes on the figures outside, watching them pass with that same slow, ghostlike pace. None of them looked back again. They just walked endlessly, obediently, as if drawn by some invisible tether. I don‚Äôt know how long I watched. Minutes? Hours? It felt like time had dissolved into the rhythm of the train and the hush of those blank faces drifting by.

Then, through the grime-streaked glass, a station emerged from the dark.

The train slowed, the brakes letting out a soft hiss like an exhale. The doors opened without a chime or announcement, just a quiet invitation. I stood, hesitating for a second. Then I stepped forward, drawn by something I couldn‚Äôt name. Maybe curiosity. Maybe instinct. Maybe the growing certainty that this was no ordinary ride home.

I clutched my bag tightly and stepped off.

The station was quiet. Too quiet.

Pale lighting flickered above, casting a soft ivory glow over every surface. There was classical music playing faintly, some string piece I couldn‚Äôt name, maybe Debussy or Satie,but it echoed as though it had been playing forever, looping in a forgotten corner of a dream. The acoustics were wrong. A fog dusted the floor, almost like dry ice had been hidden in the corner.¬†

The walls gleamed, tiles white as bone, without a smudge or crack. No stains, no ads torn halfway down, no gum under the benches. Even the trash bins were empty. It wasn‚Äôt just clean,it was sterile, like no one had ever truly been here. Or if they had, they‚Äôd been erased afterward.

And yet‚Ä¶ ads lined the far wall.

Not the usual ones for teeth whitening or discount lawyers. These were photographs, portraits. Faces I half-recognized. Not from life, but from dreams. From forgotten corners of sleep, from memories I could never fully place. One woman looked like a version of my second-grade teacher, but with green eyes and a crown of wheat. Another man reminded me of someone I once saw standing outside my apartment window at 2 a.m., ten years ago. I was certain I‚Äôd never seen these people in waking life, and yet there they were. Smiling. Still. Almost expectant.¬†

The brand names were vague, I wasn‚Äôt even sure if they were English. My eyes couldn‚Äôt focus enough on the logos to take in any details.¬†

Other passengers stood along the platform. At first, I thought they might board. But none of them moved. Some murmured to themselves. Others stood perfectly still, staring into space or fiddling with watches, pendants, and small objects clutched like charms. A few whispered phrases, fragmented riddles that made no sense.

‚ÄúThe river runs backward, and so do the clocks.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúHe never took the second stair.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne more stop, or none at all.‚Äù

Their voices didn‚Äôt carry. It was like they were underwater.

I stepped further in. My shoes made no sound on the tiled floor. No one acknowledged me. No one reacted. I might as well have been a ghost among ghosts. I looked for signs. Exit, Uptown, Transfer, anything. But there was nothing. Just the gleaming walls, the frozen faces, and that low, looping melody.

There were no stairs. No escalators. No elevators. Just this platform. Endless, perfect, and sealed. My fingers tightened around the strap of my bag. The train behind me remained at the platform, doors still open. Waiting.¬† I took a step farther from the train. The lights above flickered faintly, not enough to go dark, just enough to feel like they could. My footsteps made no sound.

I looked around again, slower this time.

A strange pressure began to build in my chest. A low, crawling sense of wrongness. I felt like I was walking too far into something I wouldn't know how to leave. Like the further I got from the train, the less of myself I was carrying with me. Amid the crowd, a face called to me. I froze, staring, heart thudding in my chest as I traced each familiar feature. I knew it was my brother.

But that was impossible.

He‚Äôd died before we ever came to New York.¬†

That fire had taken everything. It caught in the middle of the night, silent and sudden, and by the time help came, it was too late. The cause had never been determined. Just one of those tragedies people nod solemnly about and try to forget.

Our family didn‚Äôt forget. My mom certainly wouldn't. We left.

So how could he be here, now?¬†

I shook my head, trying to clear it, to ground myself in reality. It couldn‚Äôt have been him.

It couldn‚Äôt.

I turned back.

The open doors of the train looked different now, less inviting, more like a wound in the wall. A slit of light in a place that shouldn't have any. I hesitated. Then the whisper of a thought brushed through my mind, not mine, but carried on the edges of instinct:

This is the only way out.

I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly dry. Without another glance at the other passengers or the sterile walls, I stepped back onto the train.

As my foot crossed the threshold, a chill rushed over me. Colder than before. Deeper. Like stepping into the memory of winter. I sat down quickly, bag clutched tight in my lap, and tried not to look out the window. The doors slid shut behind me with a slow, deliberate hiss. The train began to move.

And as I settled into my seat again and the train lurched forward, a cold, cutting wind crept into the closed car. It had started as a draft, but only a thin trickle of air which tickled my neck. But it came, bulging in the course of a few moments into a wild, shrieking gust, as if the train had opened its veins to the world. Wind whipped down the aisle, tugging at my coat, messing strands of hair, icy on the sweat glued to my skin.

The wind shouldn't have been that strong. The windows weren‚Äôt open. The train was closed, air-conditioned to perfection like always. But this wind had a presence, there but not seen. I pulled myself into my coat, holding my bag as if it would ground me. Then, under the shriek of air, I heard something else. A whisper. But unmistakable.

It was my name.

I sat upright, my heart pounding in my chest. The whisper came again, so low I could barely pick it out, but as distinct as my thoughts. My name, sung through like an echo of a tunnel, spoken not with cruelty but with hunger.¬†

I looked around at the car, still empty. Quiet still, other than the wind and the pounding rhythm of the beat of my heart. Lights above flashed. Not loosely, electrically. But on purpose. As if the train itself was trembling. And then there was the deceleration of momentum. Slowly slowing down, passing on of inertia, the gentle pull in my stomach. The train was slowing once again.

Forward, the darkness broke apart to let in light. Not sterile white of a sanitized station. Not even the pale light of industrial halogens. This was rich, red light, alive, pulsating as if it were imbued with its heartbeat. It poured in through the windows in heavy waves, cloaking the inside of the train in a cave of crimson.

I stood up involuntarily, as if my body had decided something by itself. My legs pulled me toward the door, forced by some energy that did not entirely feel mine. The train came to a stop, and the doors slid open softly.

It wasn't a platform that stood there.

In its stead, a nightclub spread out like an underground cave. Black marble-lined walls glowed with crimson veins of neon. The floor shone beneath your feet like melted glass. Each surface caught the light in unnerving, twisted fashions, as though the room was shifting, reforming itself constantly to remain just this side of graspable.

And the music, deep, beaty, sensual, thrashed in the air. It wasn't brash. It didn't have to be. It shook in your bones, slower than a beat but closer. As if the beat had always been in you, and now the world is mirroring it.

Bodies moved in the room, dancing stiffly with elegance. They were beautiful. Too beautiful. Each of them chiseled like a dream or a Vogue cover, but wrong in a way I couldn't understand. Their faces were smooth and expressionless, like porcelain masks with a forever grin. Eyes black and impossible deep. Their movement was hypnotic, smooth, as if they weren't dancing to the music but were the music. And most strangely, they were all naked.¬†

A stench of scent hit me. Perfume so potent it was bordering on rotten, the astringent tang of sweat, and something below that, metallic and irrevocable. Iron. I gagged, the smell remaining on the back of my throat like blood. And then the voices. Whispers in a dozen different timbres, interweaving the bass, curling around my ears like smoke.

""Come in,"" they whispered.

""We've been waiting.""

""You've always fantasized about this.""

""We know what you want.""

I ached to run. I ached to turn back. But my feet stayed rooted just beyond the train, drawn to heat, rhythm, weight of the air. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement. One of the riders. A man I'd not even noticed until now. How did I not see him?¬†

He stood up from a bench on the inside of the train. A young man, dressed in business clothes, his tie loose, his eyes opened wide with awe. He spoke not a word, fought not. He simply walked ahead, moving as slowly as a somnambulist. He stepped off the train and onto the glowing dance floor.

The dancers shifted without missing a beat. They didn't stop, didn't blink. They shifted, making space for him with an inhuman fluidity. They found him, every one of them, and he stood still in the middle of their circle.

He stopped. Then smiled. Not a happy smile. Not even a relief smile. It was empty. Like something inside him had been removed. The dancers closed in around him. And I heard the scream.

It didn't come from the crowd. It came from the wall.

I approached the noise and saw an enormous mirror hung on a gold frame, radiating faintly with the same red light that filled the room. And within this mirror, the young man was pushed up against the glass from within. His mouth was agape, screaming, but he was making no sound. His hands clawed the glass. His eyes were wild, desperate, frightened. The scene behind him was chaos. A twisted, true version of the lounge beyond the flashy red lights. The other patrons inside the mirror were screaming, thrown about by invisible winds. Everything within that reflection was warped, violent, and wrong.

Behind him, the dancers moved in step. As if nothing had occurred. As if he had never lived at all. The mirror pulsed. The whispers returned, louder now, piling and insisting:

""You don't choose what you want.""

""The want chooses you.""

I stepped back. My boot caught on the lip of the train door. The dancers adjusted in my direction,just a little. Just enough. Enough for me. I launched myself back aboard the train. My breath caught as the doors slammed shut. The train groaned and began to move again, dragging me from the red light, from the mirror, from the scream that still echoed inside my chest.

I fell into the chair, my heart pounding. The gust of wind returned, almost soft. The way fingers combed my hair. But the scent lingered. Perfume. Sweat. Iron.

I was disoriented and immensely confused. Where the hell was I?

This had to be a dream. Some kind of break from reality. A crack in the smooth surface of sanity. I‚Äôd read about astral projection before, back when I was dabbling in all that witchy stuff. crystals, herbs, and protection spells. I‚Äôd gotten into it for a while after I first moved to New York, just enough to recognize the signs. That had to be what this was. A lucid dream. Maybe an episode. Something my brain was doing to cope. I had to be under too much pressure.

Everything had been unraveling lately. Bills are piling up. The weird tension between me and everyone I cared about. And with the third anniversary of my mom‚Äôs suicide coming up next week... maybe that was the trigger. Grief had a way of slipping back into your life like smoke under a door, unnoticed until you couldn‚Äôt breathe.

I looked around, trying to orient myself. Fluorescent lights buzzed above me like angry insects. The walls of the subway car pulsed in a dull, metallic gray, a sterile cage on wheels. I pinched my skin hard. Nothing. So I slapped myself across the face. The sound cracked the silence, and my cheek flushed pink where the impact landed. It didn‚Äôt hurt, exactly. More like a shimmer, a tingle. Almost like when a limb falls asleep, pins and needles, but warmer. Buzzing, alive.

When returning to your body after astral projection, you usually just find your resting place and slip back in. But I didn‚Äôt feel like a floating soul. I felt dense. Solid. The seat under me was hard. The air tasted faintly of rust and electricity. My skin felt too real, too intact. Could you still feel your heartbeat during astral projection?

I stared at my hands, no glow, no transparency. Just flesh and bone and chipped nail polish. I flexed my fingers. Still me. Still trapped. Maybe if I stayed on this train, let it take me wherever it was going, I‚Äôd find my way back. The idea felt like a rope I could hold onto. So I held onto it. I chose to believe it.

I leaned back into the seat. The clack-clack-clack of the wheels echoed in my ears, the sound oddly soothing. Outside the window, tunnels rushed past in flickers of shadow and gold, overhead lights strobing through the darkness like nervous thoughts. The rhythm of the train pressed itself into my bones, the gentle sway creating an almost meditative lull. Almost peaceful.

The next stop came into view.

I leaned toward the window, squinting into the strange light ahead. It wasn‚Äôt a station. It was a food court. The train slowed, the rhythmic clacking becoming a groaning crawl. I felt the brakes shudder beneath me, and once again, as they had before, the doors slid open with that same exhale of air, mechanical and tired.

The food court stretched out around me, impossibly wide, far larger than it could be. It curved in on itself in strange, repeating angles, like I‚Äôd stepped into a place that had forgotten how to end. Everywhere I turned, the same pale tiles, the same buzzing lights overhead. The hum in the air wasn‚Äôt just sound; it was pressure, like the building was breathing around me. Holding something in.

The counters were still stocked. Endlessly, violently stocked. Trays of meat were piled high, slick with a sheen that caught the light too well. Some pieces pulsed faintly, as if remembering what it was to live. There were pastries, too many, bursting at their seams with gelatinous fillings that leaked in slow, sticky drips down their sides. The smell was sugar and rot, warm and sickly sweet. They looked like they‚Äôd been decaying for days, and yet were always just set out.

And then there was the sludge. Piles of it in steel trays, bubbling softly. Brown, green, gray, none of it resembling food. It steamed endlessly, like it was being cooked by the building itself. The ladles stood stiff in the mounds, handles glistening, untouched but never quite clean. Every time I looked away and back again, the trays had been refilled. Nothing was ever gone. Nothing ever changed.

Except for them.

The patrons.

They were scattered across the tables, if you could call them people. Bloated, distended, half-fused to their chairs. Some looked stretched thin, like their skin had forgotten how to hold shape. Others had grown around the metal frames, flesh bulging between the bars of their seats like rising dough. Their eyes were cloudy, mouths slack. One man chewed endlessly at something I couldn‚Äôt see. A woman held a fork midair, never lifting it to her mouth, never lowering it. Just frozen in the act. Like they were all trapped in some looping performance of hunger.

I couldn‚Äôt tell if they were alive. I told myself not to look too long. But I did. One turned toward me. Just slightly. The skin at her neck cracked when she moved. Then, she returned to eating.¬†

The lights overhead buzzed louder. The menus on the stalls flickered, showing food that didn‚Äôt exist. A cheeseburger with teeth. A milkshake that twitched. I kept walking, trying to find an edge, an exit, even a dead end. But the layout looped, warped. Every turn brought me back to the same corner. The sludge. The meat. The figures are in their seats.

‚ÄúFree me,‚Äù a voice called.

That stopped me in my tracks, the first human voice I‚Äôd heard since I boarded the train. A man slumped in a steel chair, grotesque and bloated. His flesh spilled over the sides like melted wax, glistening with sweat. His face, barely recognizable as human, quivered as he sobbed, yet his hands kept working, shoveling gray, unidentifiable slop from a tray into his mouth. Like he had no choice.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, stepping closer. My voice sounded small, unsure. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he rasped, not looking at me. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take it anymore.‚Äù

Suddenly, a speaker overhead crackled to life, sharp and cold. ‚ÄúConsumption is nourishment. You will be full.‚Äù The words echoed through the food court, sterile and inhuman.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said, but I didn‚Äôt know what I meant. I was sorry he was like this. I was sorry I couldn‚Äôt help. I was sorry I had come. He turned his swollen face toward me. For a moment, something real flickered in his eyes. ‚ÄúI just want to go home,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúIt was too soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was?‚Äù I asked. He opened his mouth, as if to answer, but the announcement cut in again. ‚ÄúConsumption is nourishment. You will be full.‚Äù

The effect was instant. Like a switch had been flipped. The man turned away. His expression went slack. The tears stopped. The shoveling resumed, mechanical and precise. The hunger was still there, but it no longer belonged to him. I stood frozen, heart pounding, watching him eat. His eyes no longer saw me. He was already gone.¬†

I turned to head back to the train when a terrible scream tore through the air behind me. It wasn‚Äôt just loud, it was raw, like something being ripped apart from the inside out.

I spun around. The sound came from the woman, the one who had looked at me earlier. Her eyes were wide, wild with terror. Her body jerked violently as she was dragged backward, not by hands or machinery, but by something invisible. There were no ropes, no figures. Just an unseen force pulling her toward a dark doorway at the back of the food court.

She screamed all the way in. Then, silence. Moments passed. Just when I thought I might step forward, she reappeared.

She walked slowly, mechanically, and sat back down in her seat as if nothing had happened. But she looked‚Ä¶ smaller. The grotesque layers of flesh she‚Äôd worn before were mostly gone now, stripped away as if something had peeled her like fruit. Her eyes were hollow. Her limbs moved like they were no longer hers.

As soon as she sat, more trays of slop were delivered across the food court. The other patrons began to eat again, more eagerly now, like she had somehow replenished them. It hit me all at once: she had. She‚Äôd been used. Fed into whatever machine powered this place, only to be returned diminished, but not free. Never free.

I backed away slowly, the air feeling heavier with each breath. Then I turned and stepped back onto the train. As the doors sealed behind me, I cast one last glance at the food court. I felt something close to pity for the patrons, the sad, swollen husks that slumped in their chairs, but the feeling rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt people anymore. They couldn‚Äôt be. Whatever they had been was long gone.

This whole cycle,getting off at these stops, walking through the corridors, watching things fall apart,it all seemed strange now. Pointless. Like I was just one more cog in something ancient and uncaring. I sank into my seat, eyes forward, letting the soft rattle of the train lull me into stillness. The lights flickered overhead. The wheels groaned.¬†

The weeks grew colder, the air sharper with approaching fall. Leaves began turning gold and red, a slow burn that mirrored the unease growing inside me. The townsfolk stared at me more often than ever. Their eyes were sharp like knives waiting to deliver the killing blow. With the colder weather, colder looks seemed to be descending as well.

At the diner, the usual chatter hushed when I entered. Voices fell silent like a switch had been flipped. The room felt heavier‚Ä¶ oppressive. I walked in and sat at my normal bar stool in the corner. Clara was off today‚Ä¶ in her place was Roy, an older man who knew just about everything about everyone. His grizzled appearance didn‚Äôt mask the fact that he was fairly spry for his age and could flip omelets like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. I never really liked Roy very much, but as time went by, I took any pleasantries I could find, even if they weren‚Äôt meant as such. Roy was wiping out a coffee mug with an old rag, ignoring my presence. I pulled my stool closer to the counter and tried to strike up a conversation with him.

‚ÄúDo you ever... I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ talk with folks here?‚Äù I asked, trying to sound casual.

His eyes bored holes into me, hard and cold.

‚ÄúWe talk. Just not with folks like yourself.‚Äù

I nodded as if I knew what he was talking about.

‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù I responded.

He suddenly stopped cleaning the mug. His eyes clouded over with mystery.

‚ÄúYou need to watch what comes out of your mouth around here, boy.‚Äù He said in a direct tone. ‚ÄúWe have been here a long time now‚Ä¶ and we will always be here. People like you try to come in here and poison what we have. We can‚Äôt have people coming in and ruining our little town. You understand what I‚Äôm telling you, boy?‚Äù

His demeanor completely changed. He was now leaning toward me, one elbow resting against the bar top. I started to feel threatened by his presence, but he had not yet done anything egregious. The silence lasted too long for his liking as he leaned closer toward me.

‚ÄúLet me spell it out for you‚Ä¶ Leave this place and never come back, or you‚Äôll never leave at all.‚Äù He said, staring daggers into my soul.

With that, I had heard and seen enough. I slipped off the bar stool, scrambling to grab my jacket. He leaned back off the bar top and grabbed another mug to clean. As I walked toward the door, I stopped and turned to face him.

‚ÄúThis is my home now, too. I won‚Äôt leave because of some dumb ass tradition‚Ä¶ or whatever it is.‚Äù I said confidently and with more intensity than I intended.

He looked up at me and smiled.

‚ÄúWell then, you‚Äôre dumber than you look, boy.‚Äù He said plainly and continued washing the mugs.

I made my way outside and over to my truck. As I headed back up the hill, I couldn‚Äôt get Roy‚Äôs words out of my mind.

‚ÄúLeave and don‚Äôt come back‚Ä¶ such horseshit‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled as I headed towards the cabin.

Now‚Ä¶ more than ever‚Ä¶ I needed to see her‚Ä¶ I needed to see Clara.

Clara was more distant now. When I asked her about Roy and what he meant by leaving, she brushed me off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just tradition,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúNothing to worry about, I promise! People just get worked up because they‚Äôve spent their entire lives here, and the festival is all they have left.‚Äù

I accepted her response‚Ä¶ because it came from her‚Ä¶ but I did notice some odd behavior from her that I had not seen before. Her hands shook, and her eyes darted nervously when she thought I wasn‚Äôt looking. I was so confused as to why this was all happening, and now Clara was starting to act strangely as well. I had to do something before I went insane.

The next day, I made a plan that I really didn‚Äôt want to follow through with. The plan was for me not to talk to Clara for a full day. I didn‚Äôt want to make her suspicious‚Ä¶ so after the day of not talking, I would sneak down to the diner and wait. Once she got off her shift, I would follow her and see where she went. I had never been to Clara‚Äôs house or even known where she lived, for that matter. She had never invited me over, and I never really asked about it either. I was going to find out what was going on one way or the other.

The next evening, I put my plan in motion. I stonewalled her the entire day. She texted me a few times, but I resisted the urge to respond. She eventually stopped trying. The plan was going exactly as I wanted. I made my way down the hill toward town and parked next to a snow fence just before you round the curve onto the asphalt road. I walked from there over to Harlan‚Äôs to wait for Clara‚Äôs shift to end. I followed her as she left the diner. I put my hood up, staying just far enough behind to not arouse suspicion. She moved with a strange purpose, slipping into the forest shadows... creeping and skulking through town. I kept following at a distance as she entered the forest at the edge of town. The deeper into the woods I followed, the thicker the silence grew. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, their branches clawing at the dark sky. She rounded a turn in the path, and I lost her for a moment. I picked up my speed, just enough to catch up before she got too far. I rounded the curve, and there she was. She stood in a clearing surrounded by gnarled trees, a ring of scorched stones surrounding it.

In the center of the circle, a blackened fire pit still smoldered. Around it, ashes and what looked like bits of old bone lay scattered. Once I recognized what I was seeing, I crouched quickly, clamoring behind a tree. I couldn‚Äôt see Clara anymore. The air was getting colder and darker. My heart was hammering in my chest‚Ä¶ breath catching. What was I looking at? As the question entered my mind, the coppery scent of blood hung thick in the breeze. Low, rhythmic chanting emanated from the trees around the circle. The chants started to rise like the ocean tide, growing louder and deeper with each line. A cold shiver crawled down my spine.

I peeked from behind the tree and saw them. A group of townsfolk standing in the circle‚Ä¶ eyes glazed‚Ä¶ faces expressionless. They were all wearing black robes‚Ä¶ All except for one. Clara was there; her head bowed in prayer. She was wearing a white dress that extended down past her feet. She had stripped her work uniform off and had donned this beautiful silk gown that fluttered in the chilled wind. I scanned the group and saw Tom, standing stiff and silent. The firelight flickered on faces‚Ä¶ old and young‚Ä¶ men and women alike. Gene‚Ä¶ Jimmy‚Ä¶ everyone in town was here. They chanted in a language I didn‚Äôt understand, as a group of hooded figures made their way towards the center.

Suddenly, the chanting stopped. Silence swallowed the clearing. In my horror, I had leaned too far out from behind my only cover and had been exposed. Tom saw me. His eyes turned sharply, locking onto mine. He shook his head side to side subtly, never breaking eye contact. I knew exactly what he meant‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt interfere‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt be seen‚Ä¶ I crouched behind the tree slowly and watched as the ceremony continued. Clara raised her arms toward the sky and screamed. The sound pierced the trembling night. It was oppressively loud. I covered my ears, fearing my eardrums would burst from the intense yell. The others joined in with her in unison. The fire swelled with intensity as the pitch heightened. The crescendo from the eerie band was met with a massive ball of flame that rolled from the pit and into the night sky.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I said under my breath.

I stumbled backward, heart in my throat‚Ä¶ I had to get out of here. I turned and ran away from the screams and into the night. It had gotten so dark, and the trees covered so much canopy that I could not see my hand in front of my face. I ran, hitting tree after tree and limb after limb. I could no longer hear the screams as I emerged from the forest and back onto the road. My heart was pounding in my chest. Sweat was pouring down my forehead and collecting on my shirt as it dripped.

‚ÄúFuck! What was that shit!?‚Äù I asked myself, panting uncontrollably.

I gathered myself and made my way back toward Harlan‚Äôs and hopefully back to my truck. As I passed by the diner, all the lights were off. There didn‚Äôt seem to be anybody inside or in the parking lot. I slowly crept my way past the diner, sticking to the shadows of the other buildings. I made my way past the grocery store and then the general store‚Ä¶ both dark and lifeless.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm home free if I can just get around this corner,‚Äù I muttered, trying to give myself the courage to make it back.

I made it to the next turn and hid in the shadow of the print shop. Around the corner would be the covered bridge and the snow fence where I left the bronco. I leaned against the cold concrete, gathering the courage for the final push. I took a deep breath and rounded the corner. As I made my move, I was met with what felt like a brick wall. I was knocked off my feet and fell straight to the ground. With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I scrambled to get up as quickly as possible. I felt a heavy boot come down against my chest, forcing me to the ground. As I struggled against the immense weight, a calm, raspy voice rattled its way into my ears:

‚ÄúStay down a moment, son... catch your breath.‚Äù

I panicked. Feeling a person‚Äôs boot pushing against my chest infuriated me.

‚ÄúGet the fuck off me! Let me go!‚Äù I yelled through gritted teeth, fighting the unknown figure.

The voice crackled out from the darkness above me once more,

‚ÄúRelax, Elias‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs me‚Ä¶ Tom!‚Äù

‚ÄúTom? What the fuck! Why are you doing this to me?‚Äù I exclaimed in return.

‚ÄúJust relax and I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù He said calmly.

It took me a solid minute or two of struggling against Tom‚Äôs weight before the adrenaline subsided and I was able to quell my racing mind. I let my arms fall limply to the concrete. I was hyperventilating, and the adrenaline dump made me feel extremely dizzy.

‚ÄúYou ok now, son? Are you ready to stand up?‚Äù Tom asked.

I couldn‚Äôt mutter any words through my intense breathing, but I was able to nod twice, giving him the answer he needed. He took his boot off my chest and grabbed my wrist. With what seemed like hardly any effort, he pulled me to my feet.

‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù He muttered.

I was in such shock and disarray that I didn‚Äôt know what the hell was even happening anymore. All I knew was that I had seen something that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see, and now I‚Äôm sure they wanted me dead. With no other option, I followed Tom into the darkness.

He led me back to his cabin, lit by a single lamp swinging on its chain. He hurriedly climbed the stairs and started unlocking his door. I stopped just short of the stairs, looking at the now illuminated black robe that he was wearing. I had been thrown back to that moment‚Ä¶ when he locked eyes with me. Why would he help me if he were a part of all this? Is he going to turn me over to them? These were the thoughts running through my head as he opened the door and turned to look at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doin‚Äô? Don‚Äôt just stand there. Get your ass inside‚Ä¶ now!‚Äù

I hesitated for a moment and then proceeded to follow him inside his cabin.

Once inside, Tom started to disrobe. He was pulling at the waist strap as he pointed at a chair by the fireplace.

‚ÄúSit down over there. We‚Äôve got a lot to discuss.‚Äù He said sternly.

As he disappeared into the darker side of the cabin, I walked over to the fireplace and sat down. A few moments later, Tom returned without the black robe. Ironically, he had changed into the exact opposite‚Ä¶ a cream-colored sweater and blue jeans. My eyes never left him as he meandered over to the pile of logs next to the fire. He picked up a few in his arms and turned his head to look at me.

‚ÄúI bet your head is all kinds of crazy right now, ain‚Äôt it?‚Äù He said with a hint of sarcasm.

He began stacking the wood and lighting it, producing a warm flame that lit the entire room. I stayed silent, hoping that he would get the hint that I did not even remotely trust him anymore. He was going to have to explain himself in detail before I would believe a word he said. He sat down in a chair next to mine, studying the flames with his eyes.

‚ÄúYou want a drink?‚Äù He asked.

I remained silent, my mind still reeling from what I had just endured. He stood up, grabbed a couple of glasses from the table, and a decanter full of whiskey. He poured both glasses half full and then offered one to me.

‚ÄúHere ya go.‚Äù He set the glass down on the table in front of me and took a sip of his own.

The silence lingered in the air for a moment or two‚Ä¶ the crackling fire filling the void between us. He finally spoke, cutting the silence like a knife.

‚ÄúThis town...‚Äù he began, voice low, ‚Äúit survives on a ritual‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused for a moment and then continued.

¬†‚ÄúEvery fall, at the harvest, they offer a sacrifice... To keep the people‚Ä¶ young and healthy.‚Äù

I stared at him, maintaining my silent demeanor.

‚ÄúYa see, the funny thing about this sacrificial business is that it‚Äôs gotten harder to perform over the years. The early years were easy, and nobody batted an eye. But now‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just a lot harder than it used to be.‚Äù He took another swallow of whiskey.

I could see that the man was being sincere with his words. He was telling me the truth. Though all my being told me not to, I spoke up.

‚ÄúWho... who do they sacrifice?‚Äù I asked.

Tom‚Äôs gaze didn‚Äôt waver.

‚ÄúOutsiders... Every year, they pick someone not from here. Someone who doesn‚Äôt belong‚Ä¶ someone who blows into town on a whim. Years ago, before all this technology, it was easy to make one person disappear‚Ä¶ Nobody noticed.‚Äù

The room seemed to close in on us both.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked, voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúBecause if they don‚Äôt, the town‚Ä¶ turns. The people become somethin‚Äô else‚Ä¶ somethin‚Äô angry‚Ä¶ savage.‚Äù He took a drink and continued, ‚ÄúAnd then‚Ä¶ if they don‚Äôt get it done by the end of the winter‚Ä¶ they all die‚Ä¶ includin‚Äô me.‚Äù

The weight of the words poured from his lips like molasses. A cold sweat broke out over me as I began to understand the reason why the people had acted that way toward me.

‚ÄúYou mean... I‚Äôm next?‚Äù

He nodded grimly, staring into the fire as if searching for comfort.

‚ÄúAfraid so, son‚Ä¶ I must admit, I don't enjoy this type of thing, though‚Ä¶ When I came back from ‚ÄòNam, I was a different man‚Ä¶ hell‚Ä¶ I was a different person altogether. I had seen things that would make Friday the 13^(th)¬†look like a puppet show.‚Äù

I looked at the floor, watching the fire‚Äôs light dance across the beams.

‚ÄúWell... If I‚Äôm next, then why haven‚Äôt you killed me yet?‚Äù I asked plainly.

Tom smirked and blew air out of his nose in a slight chuckle.

‚ÄúElias, I could‚Äôve killed you the day I met you. I could‚Äôve killed you on the pavement earlier with my bare hands‚Ä¶ did you ever stop to think that maybe I don‚Äôt want to kill you?‚Äù he asked, staring directly into my eyes.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ No, I guess not.‚Äù I responded half-heartedly.

Tom picked up his glass and downed the rest of his whiskey before standing and walking over to me. I flinched a bit as his imposing presence stood over me. He put his hand on my shoulder and spoke with a solemn tone that I‚Äôd never heard from him before.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, Elias‚Ä¶ tired of livin‚Äô‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs nothin‚Äô but problems and attitudes nowadays‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve died over there in that jungle‚Ä¶ in that hell‚Ä¶‚Äù his eyes seemed to drift as if he could see something in the air that I could not. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm ready to hang it up, son‚Ä¶ and I need your help to do that.‚Äù

With that, he patted my shoulder and began walking away toward the back of his cabin.

‚ÄúBlankets are on the couch. You'd best get some sleep. We have a big day tomorrow.‚Äù Tom remarked as he disappeared into the dark.

I sat alone, pondering everything. The cabin‚Ä¶ Harlan‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Clara‚Ä¶ everything‚Ä¶ was it all just a setup? Was any of it true at all?

The weeks grew colder, the air sharper with approaching fall. Leaves began turning gold and red, a slow burn that mirrored the unease growing inside me. The townsfolk stared at me more often than ever. Their eyes were sharp like knives waiting to deliver the killing blow. With the colder weather, colder looks seemed to be descending as well.

At the diner, the usual chatter hushed when I entered. Voices fell silent like a switch had been flipped. The room felt heavier‚Ä¶ oppressive. I walked in and sat at my normal bar stool in the corner. Clara was off today‚Ä¶ in her place was Roy, an older man who knew just about everything about everyone. His grizzled appearance didn‚Äôt mask the fact that he was fairly spry for his age and could flip omelets like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. I never really liked Roy very much, but as time went by, I took any pleasantries I could find, even if they weren‚Äôt meant as such. Roy was wiping out a coffee mug with an old rag, ignoring my presence. I pulled my stool closer to the counter and tried to strike up a conversation with him.

‚ÄúDo you ever... I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ talk with folks here?‚Äù I asked, trying to sound casual.

His eyes bored holes into me, hard and cold.

‚ÄúWe talk. Just not with folks like yourself.‚Äù

I nodded as if I knew what he was talking about.

‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù I responded.

He suddenly stopped cleaning the mug. His eyes clouded over with mystery.

‚ÄúYou need to watch what comes out of your mouth around here, boy.‚Äù He said in a direct tone. ‚ÄúWe have been here a long time now‚Ä¶ and we will always be here. People like you try to come in here and poison what we have. We can‚Äôt have people coming in and ruining our little town. You understand what I‚Äôm telling you, boy?‚Äù

His demeanor completely changed. He was now leaning toward me, one elbow resting against the bar top. I started to feel threatened by his presence, but he had not yet done anything egregious. The silence lasted too long for his liking as he leaned closer toward me.

‚ÄúLet me spell it out for you‚Ä¶ Leave this place and never come back, or you‚Äôll never leave at all.‚Äù He said, staring daggers into my soul.

With that, I had heard and seen enough. I slipped off the bar stool, scrambling to grab my jacket. He leaned back off the bar top and grabbed another mug to clean. As I walked toward the door, I stopped and turned to face him.

‚ÄúThis is my home now, too. I won‚Äôt leave because of some dumb ass tradition‚Ä¶ or whatever it is.‚Äù I said confidently and with more intensity than I intended.

He looked up at me and smiled.

‚ÄúWell then, you‚Äôre dumber than you look, boy.‚Äù He said plainly and continued washing the mugs.

I made my way outside and over to my truck. As I headed back up the hill, I couldn‚Äôt get Roy‚Äôs words out of my mind.

‚ÄúLeave and don‚Äôt come back‚Ä¶ such horseshit‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled as I headed towards the cabin.

Now‚Ä¶ more than ever‚Ä¶ I needed to see her‚Ä¶ I needed to see Clara.

Clara was more distant now. When I asked her about Roy and what he meant by leaving, she brushed me off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just tradition,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúNothing to worry about, I promise! People just get worked up because they‚Äôve spent their entire lives here, and the festival is all they have left.‚Äù

I accepted her response‚Ä¶ because it came from her‚Ä¶ but I did notice some odd behavior from her that I had not seen before. Her hands shook, and her eyes darted nervously when she thought I wasn‚Äôt looking. I was so confused as to why this was all happening, and now Clara was starting to act strangely as well. I had to do something before I went insane.

The next day, I made a plan that I really didn‚Äôt want to follow through with. The plan was for me not to talk to Clara for a full day. I didn‚Äôt want to make her suspicious‚Ä¶ so after the day of not talking, I would sneak down to the diner and wait. Once she got off her shift, I would follow her and see where she went. I had never been to Clara‚Äôs house or even known where she lived, for that matter. She had never invited me over, and I never really asked about it either. I was going to find out what was going on one way or the other.

The next evening, I put my plan in motion. I stonewalled her the entire day. She texted me a few times, but I resisted the urge to respond. She eventually stopped trying. The plan was going exactly as I wanted. I made my way down the hill toward town and parked next to a snow fence just before you round the curve onto the asphalt road. I walked from there over to Harlan‚Äôs to wait for Clara‚Äôs shift to end. I followed her as she left the diner. I put my hood up, staying just far enough behind to not arouse suspicion. She moved with a strange purpose, slipping into the forest shadows... creeping and skulking through town. I kept following at a distance as she entered the forest at the edge of town. The deeper into the woods I followed, the thicker the silence grew. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, their branches clawing at the dark sky. She rounded a turn in the path, and I lost her for a moment. I picked up my speed, just enough to catch up before she got too far. I rounded the curve, and there she was. She stood in a clearing surrounded by gnarled trees, a ring of scorched stones surrounding it.

In the center of the circle, a blackened fire pit still smoldered. Around it, ashes and what looked like bits of old bone lay scattered. Once I recognized what I was seeing, I crouched quickly, clamoring behind a tree. I couldn‚Äôt see Clara anymore. The air was getting colder and darker. My heart was hammering in my chest‚Ä¶ breath catching. What was I looking at? As the question entered my mind, the coppery scent of blood hung thick in the breeze. Low, rhythmic chanting emanated from the trees around the circle. The chants started to rise like the ocean tide, growing louder and deeper with each line. A cold shiver crawled down my spine.

I peeked from behind the tree and saw them. A group of townsfolk standing in the circle‚Ä¶ eyes glazed‚Ä¶ faces expressionless. They were all wearing black robes‚Ä¶ All except for one. Clara was there; her head bowed in prayer. She was wearing a white dress that extended down past her feet. She had stripped her work uniform off and had donned this beautiful silk gown that fluttered in the chilled wind. I scanned the group and saw Tom, standing stiff and silent. The firelight flickered on faces‚Ä¶ old and young‚Ä¶ men and women alike. Gene‚Ä¶ Jimmy‚Ä¶ everyone in town was here. They chanted in a language I didn‚Äôt understand, as a group of hooded figures made their way towards the center.

Suddenly, the chanting stopped. Silence swallowed the clearing. In my horror, I had leaned too far out from behind my only cover and had been exposed. Tom saw me. His eyes turned sharply, locking onto mine. He shook his head side to side subtly, never breaking eye contact. I knew exactly what he meant‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt interfere‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt be seen‚Ä¶ I crouched behind the tree slowly and watched as the ceremony continued. Clara raised her arms toward the sky and screamed. The sound pierced the trembling night. It was oppressively loud. I covered my ears, fearing my eardrums would burst from the intense yell. The others joined in with her in unison. The fire swelled with intensity as the pitch heightened. The crescendo from the eerie band was met with a massive ball of flame that rolled from the pit and into the night sky.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I said under my breath.

I stumbled backward, heart in my throat‚Ä¶ I had to get out of here. I turned and ran away from the screams and into the night. It had gotten so dark, and the trees covered so much canopy that I could not see my hand in front of my face. I ran, hitting tree after tree and limb after limb. I could no longer hear the screams as I emerged from the forest and back onto the road. My heart was pounding in my chest. Sweat was pouring down my forehead and collecting on my shirt as it dripped.

‚ÄúFuck! What was that shit!?‚Äù I asked myself, panting uncontrollably.

I gathered myself and made my way back toward Harlan‚Äôs and hopefully back to my truck. As I passed by the diner, all the lights were off. There didn‚Äôt seem to be anybody inside or in the parking lot. I slowly crept my way past the diner, sticking to the shadows of the other buildings. I made my way past the grocery store and then the general store‚Ä¶ both dark and lifeless.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm home free if I can just get around this corner,‚Äù I muttered, trying to give myself the courage to make it back.

I made it to the next turn and hid in the shadow of the print shop. Around the corner would be the covered bridge and the snow fence where I left the bronco. I leaned against the cold concrete, gathering the courage for the final push. I took a deep breath and rounded the corner. As I made my move, I was met with what felt like a brick wall. I was knocked off my feet and fell straight to the ground. With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I scrambled to get up as quickly as possible. I felt a heavy boot come down against my chest, forcing me to the ground. As I struggled against the immense weight, a calm, raspy voice rattled its way into my ears:

‚ÄúStay down a moment, son... catch your breath.‚Äù

I panicked. Feeling a person‚Äôs boot pushing against my chest infuriated me.

‚ÄúGet the fuck off me! Let me go!‚Äù I yelled through gritted teeth, fighting the unknown figure.

The voice crackled out from the darkness above me once more,

‚ÄúRelax, Elias‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs me‚Ä¶ Tom!‚Äù

‚ÄúTom? What the fuck! Why are you doing this to me?‚Äù I exclaimed in return.

‚ÄúJust relax and I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù He said calmly.

It took me a solid minute or two of struggling against Tom‚Äôs weight before the adrenaline subsided and I was able to quell my racing mind. I let my arms fall limply to the concrete. I was hyperventilating, and the adrenaline dump made me feel extremely dizzy.

‚ÄúYou ok now, son? Are you ready to stand up?‚Äù Tom asked.

I couldn‚Äôt mutter any words through my intense breathing, but I was able to nod twice, giving him the answer he needed. He took his boot off my chest and grabbed my wrist. With what seemed like hardly any effort, he pulled me to my feet.

‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù He muttered.

I was in such shock and disarray that I didn‚Äôt know what the hell was even happening anymore. All I knew was that I had seen something that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see, and now I‚Äôm sure they wanted me dead. With no other option, I followed Tom into the darkness.

He led me back to his cabin, lit by a single lamp swinging on its chain. He hurriedly climbed the stairs and started unlocking his door. I stopped just short of the stairs, looking at the now illuminated black robe that he was wearing. I had been thrown back to that moment‚Ä¶ when he locked eyes with me. Why would he help me if he were a part of all this? Is he going to turn me over to them? These were the thoughts running through my head as he opened the door and turned to look at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doin‚Äô? Don‚Äôt just stand there. Get your ass inside‚Ä¶ now!‚Äù

I hesitated for a moment and then proceeded to follow him inside his cabin.

Once inside, Tom started to disrobe. He was pulling at the waist strap as he pointed at a chair by the fireplace.

‚ÄúSit down over there. We‚Äôve got a lot to discuss.‚Äù He said sternly.

As he disappeared into the darker side of the cabin, I walked over to the fireplace and sat down. A few moments later, Tom returned without the black robe. Ironically, he had changed into the exact opposite‚Ä¶ a cream-colored sweater and blue jeans. My eyes never left him as he meandered over to the pile of logs next to the fire. He picked up a few in his arms and turned his head to look at me.

‚ÄúI bet your head is all kinds of crazy right now, ain‚Äôt it?‚Äù He said with a hint of sarcasm.

He began stacking the wood and lighting it, producing a warm flame that lit the entire room. I stayed silent, hoping that he would get the hint that I did not even remotely trust him anymore. He was going to have to explain himself in detail before I would believe a word he said. He sat down in a chair next to mine, studying the flames with his eyes.

‚ÄúYou want a drink?‚Äù He asked.

I remained silent, my mind still reeling from what I had just endured. He stood up, grabbed a couple of glasses from the table, and a decanter full of whiskey. He poured both glasses half full and then offered one to me.

‚ÄúHere ya go.‚Äù He set the glass down on the table in front of me and took a sip of his own.

The silence lingered in the air for a moment or two‚Ä¶ the crackling fire filling the void between us. He finally spoke, cutting the silence like a knife.

‚ÄúThis town...‚Äù he began, voice low, ‚Äúit survives on a ritual‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused for a moment and then continued.

¬†‚ÄúEvery fall, at the harvest, they offer a sacrifice... To keep the people‚Ä¶ young and healthy.‚Äù

I stared at him, maintaining my silent demeanor.

‚ÄúYa see, the funny thing about this sacrificial business is that it‚Äôs gotten harder to perform over the years. The early years were easy, and nobody batted an eye. But now‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just a lot harder than it used to be.‚Äù He took another swallow of whiskey.

I could see that the man was being sincere with his words. He was telling me the truth. Though all my being told me not to, I spoke up.

‚ÄúWho... who do they sacrifice?‚Äù I asked.

Tom‚Äôs gaze didn‚Äôt waver.

‚ÄúOutsiders... Every year, they pick someone not from here. Someone who doesn‚Äôt belong‚Ä¶ someone who blows into town on a whim. Years ago, before all this technology, it was easy to make one person disappear‚Ä¶ Nobody noticed.‚Äù

The room seemed to close in on us both.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked, voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúBecause if they don‚Äôt, the town‚Ä¶ turns. The people become somethin‚Äô else‚Ä¶ somethin‚Äô angry‚Ä¶ savage.‚Äù He took a drink and continued, ‚ÄúAnd then‚Ä¶ if they don‚Äôt get it done by the end of the winter‚Ä¶ they all die‚Ä¶ includin‚Äô me.‚Äù

The weight of the words poured from his lips like molasses. A cold sweat broke out over me as I began to understand the reason why the people had acted that way toward me.

‚ÄúYou mean... I‚Äôm next?‚Äù

He nodded grimly, staring into the fire as if searching for comfort.

It has been 33 long years since the day my mother died from pushing me out of the womb, and I can still feel her pain as if it were my own. I ran away from that pain for so many years, trying desperately to feel anything else. I spent every cent I had ever earned on drugs, cheap booze, and fuel for the road. I have been running for so long, and yet, gnawing at me was a voice telling me to slow down... That there was a place for me out there somewhere. That is when I saw my way out. Nestled in the rolling hills of Northern West Virginia was a small log cabin for sale. The listing offered beautiful landscapes and a quiet 10-acre lot for the ridiculously low price of $115,000. For that much of a deal, I could not pass it up. I gathered the money I had left in my account from my inheritance, loaded up my ‚Äô79 Bronco, and headed toward my new home.

The gravel crunched under the tires as I pulled into the cabin driveway. My old Bronco rattled over the uneven ground as I glanced up at the place I hoped would be my salvation. A cabin, weathered by time and the harsh northern winters, stood quietly at the edge of a dense forest. When I saw it online, I could not have dreamt a more perfect place for my tired soul‚Ä¶ but now that I was here, it seemed less appealing than I had imagined. Moss climbed the stairs. Tree roots tangled around the foundation like veins. I ran my hand over the cracked wood of the porch railing, feeling its roughness beneath my fingertips. No matter how dilapidated the house looked, it was vastly different compared to the savage streets of Detroit.

This was it‚Ä¶ A chance to escape. To bury my past. To finally breathe.

I‚Äôd spent years on the road‚Ä¶ weeks spent in cheap motels; nights filled with regrets and a numbness I couldn‚Äôt shake. But this place, this wild patch of land surrounded by towering pines and ancient oaks, felt different. Raw and untouched. Alive.

The air was sharp with pine and earth, the scent of rain lingering on the breeze. I inhaled deeply, chest tightening against the clean air. It was fresh and calm‚Ä¶ but seemed to have something attached to it. Something I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. I unpacked my bags from the Bronco‚Ä¶ the last material thing I owned from a past life. A life that I wanted to forget.

The quaint little cabin sat just beyond the town of Indigo Falls‚Ä¶ a small dot on the map. A sleepy little West Virginia town that boasted only a small cluster of buildings that were barely visible from the highway. There were a few trucks, a general store, and a diner with a flickering neon sign that spelled out ‚ÄúHarlan‚Äôs‚Äù in tired pink letters.

The first three days blurred into quiet routines‚Ä¶ time spent unpacking boxes, stacking wood, and exploring the thick woods that surrounded the cabin became the norm. The forest was both comforting and unsettling. Every crack of a branch underfoot echoed in the silence of the meadows and clearings. Shadows shifted just beyond the edge of the trees, as if you always had someone with you. The wind blowing through the canopy sounded like whispers flowing along in the breeze.

At night, the forest pulsed with life. Owls hooted, insects droned, and something deeper stirred... something strange... Something I didn‚Äôt understand, and yet, I didn‚Äôt care to. This place was paradise from what I had come from and endured. A little oddity here and there wasn‚Äôt going to scare me off.

On my fourth day in town, after a vigorous morning of chores, hunger and curiosity led me to the diner. I drove down the hill and across the covered bridge that connects the rolling hills with the center of town. Crossing over the small speed bump that separated dirt from asphalt, I spotted a sign that read ‚ÄúIndigo Falls ‚Äì Population: 48‚Äù. This place was amazing. The roads had no red lights or even stop signs. The only cautionary measure was a yellow caution light that blinked intermittently at the center of town. I pulled into the diner‚Äôs parking lot and secured a spot. Harlan‚Äôs Diner was a squat brick building with chipped paint and windows fogged by steam. The place was packed. It looked like every person in town was having breakfast at the same time. The bell above the door jingled as I stepped inside. The smell hit me instantly... bacon grease, strong coffee, and something metallic, faint but unmistakable‚Ä¶ the griddle, sizzling with eggs and bacon covering every inch.

The diner was full, aside from an open seat here and there. Old men and women occupied the creaking metal bar stools that lined the counter. They sat nursing their black coffee and folded newspapers, occasionally chatting with one another. Their conversations were low, punctuated by laughter that didn‚Äôt quite reach their eyes. As the door closed behind me, ringing the bell once more, all heads turned‚Ä¶ not in hostility, but in awareness. They didn‚Äôt know me, and they wanted me to feel that. The silence was deafening as my feet froze to the sticky linoleum floor. I could feel every set of eyes on me like red-hot fire pokers jabbing at my soul.

Behind the counter was a woman. Her red hair was pulled back in a loose knot, strands falling over her face. She looked up and smiled, the kind of smile that someone gives as forced pleasantry.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just stand there, come on in,‚Äù she said in a sweet, inviting tone.

I stumbled awkwardly as I turned in her direction and shuffled over to an open stool.

‚ÄúNew in town?‚Äù she asked, her voice warm but tired.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, sliding onto the stool. ‚ÄúMoved into the cabin outside town a few days ago.‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Clarice, but everybody here calls me Clara, hence the nametag.‚Äù

She pointed to her shirt at a patch that had ‚ÄúClara‚Äù stitched in black thread.

‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Elias Smith.‚Äù

She wiped her hands on a rag and poured me a black coffee.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ Elias Smith‚Ä¶‚Äù She said in a playful, teasing way. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find it‚Äôs quiet here. Too quiet, some say.‚Äù

I let out a small laugh.

‚ÄúWhy do you say that?‚Äù I asked as I took a sip of my coffee.

‚ÄúWell, some folks don‚Äôt like to be bothered‚Ä¶ especially around here.‚Äù

She shot a glance over at an old man who was peering across the top of his newspaper at us. I glanced, following her eyes over to the man. As my eyes met his, he ducked behind his newspaper once more.

‚ÄúHmmm‚Ä¶ Well, I guess I can‚Äôt say I blame them.‚Äù I responded, turning my head back around to meet Clara‚Äôs eyes.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about that old grouch.‚Äù She said in a playful tone. ‚ÄúHe just needs another cup of coffee.‚Äù

She shot another glance at the man, yet he didn‚Äôt reveal his face from behind the paper this time. She focused back on my face as she spoke to me,

‚ÄúSo, whatcha want for breakfast, hon?‚Äù

The rest of the morning was spent in playful conversation with Clara, the cute, red-haired woman who seemed to be sent here just for me.

Clara felt completely different from the people in town. She was kind and warm. A person who was gentle and understanding in such a way that you could talk to her about anything. Over the next few days, I finished the arduous move-in process. My reward was enjoying Clara‚Äôs company at Harlan‚Äôs with a strong cup of coffee and a hearty breakfast.

¬†I had been in town for only a week, but it felt like I had been here for decades with Clara behind the counter. She had become my beacon of hope in a place that I still wasn‚Äôt sure of yet.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶. You never told me where you were originally from.‚Äù Clara said with a curious look.

‚ÄúHmph‚Ä¶ yeah, that is a story too long to tell over just a coffee.‚Äù I half-chuckled in response.

She leaned over the counter close to me, almost touching my ear with her lips, and in a half-whisper said,

‚ÄúWell, I keep a bottle of Four Roses back here for when things get slow. Ya wanna get loaded and do naughty stuff behind the dumpsters out back?‚Äù

I choked on my coffee, and my face immediately turned red. She giggled, knowing that she had tripped me up with that comment.

‚ÄúHahaha, just messing... but seriously... I want to know more about you, Elias.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk‚Ä¶ well, you can come up to my cabin if you‚Äôd like. It‚Äôs just outside of town, across the covered bridge, up past Grist Mill Road.‚Äù I responded confidently. ‚ÄúI can give you the address and you can come by when you get off‚Ä¶ if that‚Äôs ok, of course‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHaha, that sounds perfect, honey.‚Äù She said with a smile.

Looking into her beautiful green eyes, I was captured‚Ä¶ mesmerized by her beauty. I couldn‚Äôt believe where I had found myself. I found this place by accident‚Ä¶ It was a pipedream I thought would never be achieved‚Ä¶ and yet, another part of me felt like I was owed this life. I had been through hell to get here, and it was time for a change.

From the moment I met Clara, time seemed to fly by. Over the next week, Clara and I settled into a rhythm. Mornings at Harlan‚Äôs, sharing late breakfasts. Sometimes she‚Äôd take me on slow walks near the edge of the woods, pointing out plants and telling stories about the town‚Äôs history. Over that time, I told her all about my mom and her side of the family. I told her about the times I shared with people on the road and what city life was like back in Detroit. We talked freely with one another, but we both felt like the other was holding something back‚Ä¶ hiding something.

At the beginning of my third week in town, Clara got off early and met me outside my cabin for a hike. We had become remarkably close over the last couple of weeks. As usual, this was our time to talk and decompress in the beautiful West Virginia hills. We walked down the forest trails, combing through the ins and outs of small-town life. As we walked, Clara grabbed my arm and snuggled in close to my side.

‚ÄúSo, tell me about your dad. You‚Äôve told me all about your mom and her side, but you haven‚Äôt mentioned your dad much at all,‚Äù she said, giving me a confused look.

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs a sore subject. It‚Äôs one of those things that I would like to just lock away and forget, you know what I mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do‚Ä¶ but you know we talk about everything, Eli. I want to know everything about you.‚Äù She said, smiling at me and pushing her cheek into my shoulder.

‚ÄúI guess so‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered in return.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ are you gonna tell me?‚Äù she asked, pressing a little further.

I couldn‚Äôt resist Clara‚Äôs charm. She was my kryptonite. I had only known her for a matter of a few weeks, but it felt like so much more.

¬†‚ÄúAhem‚Ä¶‚Äù I choked up a little as I started to talk, ‚ÄúWell, it starts back when I was just a baby.‚Äù I paused, knowing that this part of my life was so traumatic, so intense that I had literally compressed it into a little ball and pushed it as far back into my mind as I could, hoping that it would die and rot away without ever resurfacing again. I continued, fighting the urge to bury it again, ‚ÄúMy dad was a heavy drinker and a very mean person‚Ä¶ As a child, my brother and I only knew beatings and pain. We would get beat for being late to school‚Ä¶ beat for being late to dinner‚Ä¶ hell, we even got beat for not crying when we got beat.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my God, that is awful! I am so sorry, Elias. I didn‚Äôt know it was like that for you.‚Äù She said in a troubled and mournful tone.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok. That drunk bastard killed himself with a 12-gauge during the Super Bowl about 16 years ago, so he got what was coming to him.‚Äù I said coldly.

‚ÄúJesus! He committed suicide in front of you!?‚Äù she asked, searching my face intently for the answer.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ my brother and I weren‚Äôt home‚Ä¶ and it wasn‚Äôt a suicide. He was trying to shoot the neighbor's cat in our yard and dropped the gun while trying to open the window. Boom‚Ä¶ just like that, he ended my nightmare‚Ä¶ and my brother‚Äôs.‚Äù

She paused, not yet knowing what to say. Feeling the tension from the moment, I tried to lighten it by adding what I considered ‚Äúthe good part.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ It wasn‚Äôt all bad. My grandpa made a lot of money in the stock market before the dotcom crash in 2000. He died a couple of years later and left it to my dad. Since he didn‚Äôt have a will, my brother Josh and I received it as an inheritance when he died and split it. So, I guess the good thing about it is that I don‚Äôt have to worry about money anymore hehe.‚Äù I gave a slight chuckle, trying to relax the mood.

‚ÄúWhere is your brother now?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúLast I heard, he had joined the army and was stationed in Fort Benning. He always wanted to be in the army. He was always talking about how he wanted to make a difference and jump out of planes. I never really understood it, but it made him happy.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least he is doing something that he likes.‚Äù She responded.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I guess so.‚Äù

We walked a little further down the trail, silent. The conversation weighed heavily in the air between us. As the sun started to fall, she finally spoke up again.

‚ÄúThe Harvest Festival is coming up soon,‚Äù she said, kicking at the gravel on the trailside. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the biggest event Indigo Falls has. Everyone will be there. It‚Äôs a... tradition.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of tradition?‚Äù I asked.

She hesitated, eyes flicking to the woods.

‚ÄúOld stories. Old songs. You‚Äôll see‚Ä¶ Will you go with me?‚Äù she asked, looking up at me with her intoxicating green eyes.

‚ÄúOf course I will!‚Äù I responded quickly.

The walks I had with Clara were renewing my soul little by little. Each time we were together, I could feel a powerful warmth wash over me, and then I became calm. The townsfolk, however, weren‚Äôt as welcoming as she was. I stopped by the grocery store after mine and Clara‚Äôs hike to grab a few things for dinner. When I came through the door, I could see Jimmy, the clerk, standing behind the counter.

Since I had moved in, he was always there, no matter the time of day. It seemed like all Jimmy did was work. As I walked by him, I nodded in his direction with a half-smile. He barely looked at me. He was a nice guy, by my estimation. The times I had come in before, he was pleasant and helpful. Something was different this time‚Ä¶ something was wrong.

‚ÄúWhatcha need?‚Äù he said with a monotonous groan.

‚ÄúA few things,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust a few essentials for next week.‚Äù

He shoved the items across the counter, making no eye contact. When I tried to make conversation, he would cut me off or ask an abrupt question.

‚ÄúThat all?‚Äù he asked, his expression becoming more irritated.

‚ÄúY-Yea I guess so...‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúGood, that‚Äôll be $36.78. Cash only.‚Äù

Caught off guard by this, I quickly reached into my pocket, fumbling for the bills. He had never done this before. He always lets me use my debit card. Why was he asking for cash only? When I pulled my hand out, all I had was a 20 and a 10, accompanied by a wad of matted pocket lint. I held the money up toward Jimmy, mouth slightly agape, as if I were a mute asking if this would be enough with just my facial expression. His brow furrowed. With a violent rush, he sprang toward me and grabbed my jacket, pulling me close to him.

‚ÄúIs this some kind of sick joke, buddy?‚Äù he snarled in my face.

‚ÄúWh-What do you mean? I-I‚Äôm just trying to pay for my groceries. Look, here‚Äôs cash. It‚Äôs all I have on me right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúHa! You know damn well that ain‚Äôt what I said. I SAID, THIRTY-SIX DOLLARS AND SEVENTY-EIGHT CENTS‚Ä¶ NOT THIRTY, YOU FUCKING IDIOT!‚Äù He screamed in my face. ‚ÄúIF YOU DON‚ÄôT HAVE THE MONEY, THEN GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY STORE!‚Äù

He pushed me away from him while releasing my jacket. I stood stunned for a moment. I had never had anyone in town act like this toward me, especially not Jimmy. He stared at me, red-faced, veins popping from his neck, fuming over the audacity of my ignorance. The fact that I came in to buy groceries without exact change was inconceivable to him. As I stumbled out of the store empty-handed, all I could do was think about how this place felt‚Ä¶ different‚Ä¶ changed in some way.

The air in town felt charged... like I‚Äôd walked into a spider‚Äôs web and the spiders were watching me, waiting. I noticed people stopping their conversations when I approached. The few kids on the playground would fall silent and glance away. Older women eyed me over knitting needles, their fingers tightening involuntarily, knuckles turning white from the force. It felt like I was becoming an outcast in a place that just weeks ago was my refuge. It felt like everybody was starting to hate me for some reason.

The next night, after Clara closed the diner, I invited her to my porch for a few drinks. The sky was a patchwork of stars behind the dark silhouettes of trees. The crickets provided the perfect ambience for her pleasant company.

‚ÄúDid you hear how Jimmy acted toward me yesterday?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYeah, it was all he could talk about when he came in for dinner last night.‚Äù She responded.

‚ÄúI had some weird encounters with the folks in town as well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ strange lately.‚Äù

She lowered her head, staring at her glass. She ran her finger around the edge slowly as if she were in a trance.

‚ÄúWhy do you think they act like that?‚Äù I asked, taking a sip of a beer.

She looked out into the woods, tracing a pattern on the weathered trees.

‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre scared,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúScared of change‚Ä¶ of outsiders. Indigo Falls likes its secrets. It‚Äôs how they keep the town... safe and healthy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSafe from what?‚Äù

Her eyes met mine, filled with sadness I couldn‚Äôt place.

‚ÄúFrom what‚Äôs in these hills.‚Äù

These hills? I pondered‚Ä¶ my eyes slowly scanning the darkness.

The more I stared into them, the more they felt alive. I could feel them watching... breathing. Strange sounds echoed in the distance... a low hum‚Ä¶ the snap of twigs... not animals, something else. The mystery of the hills around me had become front and center in my mind. I couldn‚Äôt place it, but something had shifted in the air, and it was starting to cause my little piece of heaven to crumble right in front of me.

‚ÄúIs there anything I can do to stop it?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ these folks have been here a long time‚Ä¶ and I do mean a very long time‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt like anybody coming in that they don‚Äôt know.‚Äù She continued. ‚ÄúEvery year around the harvest festival, it gets this way. It will pass, and they will get back to normal. It‚Äôs just an old tradition that started a long time ago, and people never really let it go.‚Äù

My eyes searched her face as she spoke. Her words reassured me. There was nothing that Clara couldn‚Äôt fix in my mind. I just had to endure this weird ‚Äútradition‚Äù of outsider hazing or whatever they wanted to call it, and then hopefully we could get back to normal.

The rest of the night after our conversation was routine. Clara and I spent the evening swapping stories and laughing with one another well into the night. The idea of the hills having secrets stuck with me, however. My mind couldn‚Äôt erase the look on Jimmy‚Äôs face when he grabbed me. He had true hate in his eyes. I hadn‚Äôt seen that look since my dad was alive. I needed to focus on more important things to get my mind off it.

The next day, I made my way down to Gene‚Äôs general store to purchase some nails and boards for the cabin. The railing was getting on my nerves and would give me a nasty splinter every time I tried to grab it. Entering the store for the first time, I could hear the tired, old speaker behind the counter playing old music. It sounded like slow jazz‚Ä¶ something old. I grabbed my items and approached the counter.

‚ÄúGood morning, sir. I hope you found what you were looking for.‚Äù The man said in an upbeat and jolly tone.

‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶ Yeah‚Ä¶ I did. Do you‚Äî‚Äù

He cut me off before I could finish asking my question.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be $16.25, sir.‚Äù He announced with a wide smile.

¬†‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶. Ok‚Ä¶ Do you take debit cards?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTsk‚Ä¶ No, I‚Äôm afraid not, sir. Cash only here. Sorry about that.‚Äù The man responded, clicking his tongue against his teeth.

‚ÄúNo worries, I have some cash on me.‚Äù I quickly responded. I had prepared for this scenario ever since the Jimmy situation happened.

I pulled out a handful of bills and began counting the total on the counter. As I counted the bills in front of him, his eyes left my face and slowly rolled down to the counter below. Still smiling, his face started turning pink‚Ä¶ and then red‚Ä¶ his eyes started bulging from their sockets, and he began gritting his teeth so hard that I could hear them grinding behind his smile. Suddenly, he slammed his hand down against the counter, rattling the coins and flattening the bills I had placed.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a bank‚Ä¶ sir.‚Äù The man said through gritted teeth, still trying to hold his smile.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to count exact change for you. I know you need exac‚Äî‚Äù

He cut me off again before I could finish.

‚ÄúLike I said‚Ä¶ This is NOT A BANK‚Ä¶‚Ä¶SIR!‚Äù His face was now blood-red, and his eyes stared at me with pure vitriol.

‚ÄúOk, ok, no problem, man, easy. I don‚Äôt want any issues here.‚Äù

He stared at me, his hand shaking with anger, clenching the bills on the counter. Then, as quickly as the anger flared, it vanished, replaced by a chilling silence. The old radio had become more apparent now. An old jazz tune had become the background of our staring contest. A slow, almost predatory smile spread across his face before he spoke.

""You know too much,"" he remarked, his voice dangerously gleeful.

‚ÄúWhat? What do you mean I know too much?‚Äù I asked, full of confusion.

‚ÄúHave a wonderful day, sir, and remember, don‚Äôt nix it, Gene can fix it!‚Äù He answered, not acknowledging my question.

I turned to leave. As I made it outside the store doors, I looked back through the window. There, I saw Gene still standing behind the counter, that same smile plastered on his face, staring at me as I walked down the steps.

The next night, just after midnight, I heard footsteps crunching outside my window. I grabbed a flashlight and my revolver from the bedside drawer. I was in bear country, and I did not want to become dinner for whatever was out there. My heart pounded as I crept through the cabin, following the sound of the footsteps as they crunched toward the front door. The more I listened, the more they sounded like someone walking. This was no bear‚Ä¶ it was a person. The sounds were now coming from right outside‚Ä¶ heavy footsteps creaked across the slats on the front porch. I grabbed the door handle and, with a deep breath, swung the door open. As the door opened, I clicked the flashlight on and leveled the revolver in the middle of the beam. I scanned the porch and the surrounding area, but there was nothing‚Ä¶ Nothing but shadows and silence. The idea of a person skulking around my cabin did not sit too well with me, especially in these hills‚Ä¶ especially with how everyone has been acting.

The next couple of nights were more of the same. I would hear footsteps approach my window at midnight, creeping their way around the cabin until they drew me to the front door. I foolishly took the bait every time, looking like an idiot standing on my porch with nothing but boxers, a Maglite, and my dad‚Äôs old .38 revolver.

That Friday, I headed back into town to do my weekly grocery run, no matter how much I dreaded it. I knew Jimmy was going to give me shit, no matter if I had exact change or not. I learned my lesson quickly on the cash-only request. I received my groceries and endured Jimmy‚Äôs hate-filled eyes as I paid and made my way out to my truck. I loaded the groceries into the Bronco and started to hop into the driver‚Äôs seat when a wild thought struck me. I decided that, instead of getting in the Bronco and driving straight home, I was going to take a walk around town and take in the cool weather that was starting to roll in. I needed some time away from the cabin.

I walked down toward the center of town where the town hall sat. I rounded the turn on Quincy Street, head down, pondering the curiosity of this place, when suddenly, I was struck hard in the shoulder by what felt like a semi. I was sent flying, eventually crashing to the ground in a heap. As I lay on the ground trying to get my bearings, I heard a deep, raspy voice ask,

‚ÄúWhoa there, boy! You ok?‚Äù

Still dazed, I couldn‚Äôt respond to the question yet.

‚ÄúSorry bout that, son‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt see as well as I used to. Sometimes I just run right into shit and not even know it... hehehe.‚Äù

I finally gathered my wits about me and looked up at the man. He was tall and lean, his face weathered like bark, eyes sharp but cloudy, like they had seen things no human should ever see. He wore an old pair of overalls with a red shirt underneath and a straw hat that looked like it had seen better days.

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm ok. I should‚Äôve been looking when I came around that corner.‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúHeh, no worries, son. These days everybody is on that damn phone looking at stupid shit nobody cares about. It happens more times than you think.‚Äù

I laughed as the old man helped me up. His lips and skin looked parched and worn, like an old leather satchel, and he had one brown tooth that stuck out when he spoke.

‚ÄúThe name‚Äôs Tom. Tom Sheffield.‚Äù He boomed. ‚ÄúAnd you are?‚Äù

He stuck out his hand for a handshake.

‚ÄúElias‚Ä¶ Elias Smith.‚Äù I responded, grabbing the man‚Äôs calloused hand.

With a firm grip, he shook my hand and shot me a half-smile.

‚ÄúWhere ya headed, son?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I was just walking around a bit‚Ä¶ but I guess I‚Äôm gonna head on back to my truck.‚Äù I responded.

‚ÄúWell good, I‚Äôll walk with ya. It ain‚Äôt every day I get to talk to someone new, ya know?‚Äù

‚ÄúEhh‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs ok, I don‚Äôt want to interrupt your day.‚Äù I said in return.

‚ÄúNonsense, I need to stretch out the ol‚Äô legs anyway hehe.‚Äù

Tom walked with me back to my truck even as I protested. I was already on the bad side of most people in town for reasons I didn‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt need to owe anybody any favors or piss anybody off. As we walked, he kept a happy and carefree demeanor. We talked the entire way back.

‚ÄúWhen‚Äôd you move to town?‚Äù he asked, his smile slightly fading from his face.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here about a month or so. I like the place, but some of these people are just‚Ä¶ strange.‚Äù I replied.

He gave a slight nod and looked forward as if he knew exactly what I was talking about. As we approached my truck, he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and stuck one between his weathered lips and spoke.

‚ÄúWell, son, this town has some strange history. Hell, I live here and still don‚Äôt understand it.‚Äù

He took a drag on his cigarette.

‚ÄúI lived close to here as a boy ‚Äòtil I got sent to Vietnam. I wasn‚Äôt much the same after I came back from that. I had some‚Ä¶ issues at home when I got back and had to move here. I never felt like this place was home for me. I‚Äôve only lived here for ten years myself.‚Äù

He took another drag, squinting his eyes as the smoke encircled the brim of his hat.

‚ÄúThis town‚Äôs got its layers,‚Äù he said, voice rough. ‚ÄúPeople like to keep the surface smooth, but underneath... things aren‚Äôt so simple.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of things?‚Äù I asked.

He flicked ash onto the ground.

‚ÄúThings that people don‚Äôt like to talk about.‚Äù He answered. ‚ÄúNow you get your gear and head on home before it gets dark. These roads get dangerous at night.‚Äù

He took one more long drag off his cigarette and flicked it to the ground, stamping it out with his boot.

‚ÄúYou take care now, ya hear? Nice meetin‚Äô you, Elias. I‚Äôll be seein‚Äô ya.‚Äù

The man walked back the way he came, leaving me with more questions than answers. Confused, I climbed into the Bronco and made my way back home.

That night, I lay awake, listening to the wind twisting through the trees. Tom‚Äôs words swirled in my mind.

‚ÄúWhat did he mean by layers?‚Äù I asked myself. ‚ÄúAnd what don‚Äôt these people want to talk about? What is so secretive?‚Äù

The thoughts raced through my skull as I lay in bed, trying not to think about the footsteps actively crunching around the cabin‚Äôs perimeter. Indigo Falls was no longer my safe haven‚Ä¶ It had become a cage.",1,1749328912.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

It has been 33 long years since the day my mother died from pushing me out of the womb, and I can still feel her pain as if it were my own. I ran away from that pain for so many years, trying desperately to feel anything else. I spent every cent I had ever earned on drugs, cheap booze, and fuel for the road. I have been running for so long, and yet, gnawing at me was a voice telling me to slow down... That there was a place for me out there somewhere. That is when I saw my way out. Nestled in the rolling hills of Northern West Virginia was a small log cabin for sale. The listing offered beautiful landscapes and a quiet 10-acre lot for the ridiculously low price of $115,000. For that much of a deal, I could not pass it up. I gathered the money I had left in my account from my inheritance, loaded up my ‚Äô79 Bronco, and headed toward my new home.

The gravel crunched under the tires as I pulled into the cabin driveway. My old Bronco rattled over the uneven ground as I glanced up at the place I hoped would be my salvation. A cabin, weathered by time and the harsh northern winters, stood quietly at the edge of a dense forest. When I saw it online, I could not have dreamt a more perfect place for my tired soul‚Ä¶ but now that I was here, it seemed less appealing than I had imagined. Moss climbed the stairs. Tree roots tangled around the foundation like veins. I ran my hand over the cracked wood of the porch railing, feeling its roughness beneath my fingertips. No matter how dilapidated the house looked, it was vastly different compared to the savage streets of Detroit.

This was it‚Ä¶ A chance to escape. To bury my past. To finally breathe.

I‚Äôd spent years on the road‚Ä¶ weeks spent in cheap motels; nights filled with regrets and a numbness I couldn‚Äôt shake. But this place, this wild patch of land surrounded by towering pines and ancient oaks, felt different. Raw and untouched. Alive.

The air was sharp with pine and earth, the scent of rain lingering on the breeze. I inhaled deeply, chest tightening against the clean air. It was fresh and calm‚Ä¶ but seemed to have something attached to it. Something I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. I unpacked my bags from the Bronco‚Ä¶ the last material thing I owned from a past life. A life that I wanted to forget.

The quaint little cabin sat just beyond the town of Indigo Falls‚Ä¶ a small dot on the map. A sleepy little West Virginia town that boasted only a small cluster of buildings that were barely visible from the highway. There were a few trucks, a general store, and a diner with a flickering neon sign that spelled out ‚ÄúHarlan‚Äôs‚Äù in tired pink letters.

The first three days blurred into quiet routines‚Ä¶ time spent unpacking boxes, stacking wood, and exploring the thick woods that surrounded the cabin became the norm. The forest was both comforting and unsettling. Every crack of a branch underfoot echoed in the silence of the meadows and clearings. Shadows shifted just beyond the edge of the trees, as if you always had someone with you. The wind blowing through the canopy sounded like whispers flowing along in the breeze.

At night, the forest pulsed with life. Owls hooted, insects droned, and something deeper stirred... something strange... Something I didn‚Äôt understand, and yet, I didn‚Äôt care to. This place was paradise from what I had come from and endured. A little oddity here and there wasn‚Äôt going to scare me off.

On my fourth day in town, after a vigorous morning of chores, hunger and curiosity led me to the diner. I drove down the hill and across the covered bridge that connects the rolling hills with the center of town. Crossing over the small speed bump that separated dirt from asphalt, I spotted a sign that read ‚ÄúIndigo Falls ‚Äì Population: 48‚Äù. This place was amazing. The roads had no red lights or even stop signs. The only cautionary measure was a yellow caution light that blinked intermittently at the center of town. I pulled into the diner‚Äôs parking lot and secured a spot. Harlan‚Äôs Diner was a squat brick building with chipped paint and windows fogged by steam. The place was packed. It looked like every person in town was having breakfast at the same time. The bell above the door jingled as I stepped inside. The smell hit me instantly... bacon grease, strong coffee, and something metallic, faint but unmistakable‚Ä¶ the griddle, sizzling with eggs and bacon covering every inch.

The diner was full, aside from an open seat here and there. Old men and women occupied the creaking metal bar stools that lined the counter. They sat nursing their black coffee and folded newspapers, occasionally chatting with one another. Their conversations were low, punctuated by laughter that didn‚Äôt quite reach their eyes. As the door closed behind me, ringing the bell once more, all heads turned‚Ä¶ not in hostility, but in awareness. They didn‚Äôt know me, and they wanted me to feel that. The silence was deafening as my feet froze to the sticky linoleum floor. I could feel every set of eyes on me like red-hot fire pokers jabbing at my soul.

Behind the counter was a woman. Her red hair was pulled back in a loose knot, strands falling over her face. She looked up and smiled, the kind of smile that someone gives as forced pleasantry.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just stand there, come on in,‚Äù she said in a sweet, inviting tone.

I stumbled awkwardly as I turned in her direction and shuffled over to an open stool.

‚ÄúNew in town?‚Äù she asked, her voice warm but tired.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, sliding onto the stool. ‚ÄúMoved into the cabin outside town a few days ago.‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Clarice, but everybody here calls me Clara, hence the nametag.‚Äù

She pointed to her shirt at a patch that had ‚ÄúClara‚Äù stitched in black thread.

‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Elias Smith.‚Äù

She wiped her hands on a rag and poured me a black coffee.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ Elias Smith‚Ä¶‚Äù She said in a playful, teasing way. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find it‚Äôs quiet here. Too quiet, some say.‚Äù

I let out a small laugh.

‚ÄúWhy do you say that?‚Äù I asked as I took a sip of my coffee.

‚ÄúWell, some folks don‚Äôt like to be bothered‚Ä¶ especially around here.‚Äù

She shot a glance over at an old man who was peering across the top of his newspaper at us. I glanced, following her eyes over to the man. As my eyes met his, he ducked behind his newspaper once more.

‚ÄúHmmm‚Ä¶ Well, I guess I can‚Äôt say I blame them.‚Äù I responded, turning my head back around to meet Clara‚Äôs eyes.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about that old grouch.‚Äù She said in a playful tone. ‚ÄúHe just needs another cup of coffee.‚Äù

She shot another glance at the man, yet he didn‚Äôt reveal his face from behind the paper this time. She focused back on my face as she spoke to me,

‚ÄúSo, whatcha want for breakfast, hon?‚Äù

The rest of the morning was spent in playful conversation with Clara, the cute, red-haired woman who seemed to be sent here just for me.

Clara felt completely different from the people in town. She was kind and warm. A person who was gentle and understanding in such a way that you could talk to her about anything. Over the next few days, I finished the arduous move-in process. My reward was enjoying Clara‚Äôs company at Harlan‚Äôs with a strong cup of coffee and a hearty breakfast.

¬†I had been in town for only a week, but it felt like I had been here for decades with Clara behind the counter. She had become my beacon of hope in a place that I still wasn‚Äôt sure of yet.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶. You never told me where you were originally from.‚Äù Clara said with a curious look.

‚ÄúHmph‚Ä¶ yeah, that is a story too long to tell over just a coffee.‚Äù I half-chuckled in response.

She leaned over the counter close to me, almost touching my ear with her lips, and in a half-whisper said,

‚ÄúWell, I keep a bottle of Four Roses back here for when things get slow. Ya wanna get loaded and do naughty stuff behind the dumpsters out back?‚Äù

I choked on my coffee, and my face immediately turned red. She giggled, knowing that she had tripped me up with that comment.

‚ÄúHahaha, just messing... but seriously... I want to know more about you, Elias.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk‚Ä¶ well, you can come up to my cabin if you‚Äôd like. It‚Äôs just outside of town, across the covered bridge, up past Grist Mill Road.‚Äù I responded confidently. ‚ÄúI can give you the address and you can come by when you get off‚Ä¶ if that‚Äôs ok, of course‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHaha, that sounds perfect, honey.‚Äù She said with a smile.

Looking into her beautiful green eyes, I was captured‚Ä¶ mesmerized by her beauty. I couldn‚Äôt believe where I had found myself. I found this place by accident‚Ä¶ It was a pipedream I thought would never be achieved‚Ä¶ and yet, another part of me felt like I was owed this life. I had been through hell to get here, and it was time for a change.

From the moment I met Clara, time seemed to fly by. Over the next week, Clara and I settled into a rhythm. Mornings at Harlan‚Äôs, sharing late breakfasts. Sometimes she‚Äôd take me on slow walks near the edge of the woods, pointing out plants and telling stories about the town‚Äôs history. Over that time, I told her all about my mom and her side of the family. I told her about the times I shared with people on the road and what city life was like back in Detroit. We talked freely with one another, but we both felt like the other was holding something back‚Ä¶ hiding something.

At the beginning of my third week in town, Clara got off early and met me outside my cabin for a hike. We had become remarkably close over the last couple of weeks. As usual, this was our time to talk and decompress in the beautiful West Virginia hills. We walked down the forest trails, combing through the ins and outs of small-town life. As we walked, Clara grabbed my arm and snuggled in close to my side.

‚ÄúSo, tell me about your dad. You‚Äôve told me all about your mom and her side, but you haven‚Äôt mentioned your dad much at all,‚Äù she said, giving me a confused look.

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs a sore subject. It‚Äôs one of those things that I would like to just lock away and forget, you know what I mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do‚Ä¶ but you know we talk about everything, Eli. I want to know everything about you.‚Äù She said, smiling at me and pushing her cheek into my shoulder.

‚ÄúI guess so‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered in return.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ are you gonna tell me?‚Äù she asked, pressing a little further.

I couldn‚Äôt resist Clara‚Äôs charm. She was my kryptonite. I had only known her for a matter of a few weeks, but it felt like so much more.

¬†‚ÄúAhem‚Ä¶‚Äù I choked up a little as I started to talk, ‚ÄúWell, it starts back when I was just a baby.‚Äù I paused, knowing that this part of my life was so traumatic, so intense that I had literally compressed it into a little ball and pushed it as far back into my mind as I could, hoping that it would die and rot away without ever resurfacing again. I continued, fighting the urge to bury it again, ‚ÄúMy dad was a heavy drinker and a very mean person‚Ä¶ As a child, my brother and I only knew beatings and pain. We would get beat for being late to school‚Ä¶ beat for being late to dinner‚Ä¶ hell, we even got beat for not crying when we got beat.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my God, that is awful! I am so sorry, Elias. I didn‚Äôt know it was like that for you.‚Äù She said in a troubled and mournful tone.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok. That drunk bastard killed himself with a 12-gauge during the Super Bowl about 16 years ago, so he got what was coming to him.‚Äù I said coldly.

‚ÄúJesus! He committed suicide in front of you!?‚Äù she asked, searching my face intently for the answer.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ my brother and I weren‚Äôt home‚Ä¶ and it wasn‚Äôt a suicide. He was trying to shoot the neighbor's cat in our yard and dropped the gun while trying to open the window. Boom‚Ä¶ just like that, he ended my nightmare‚Ä¶ and my brother‚Äôs.‚Äù

She paused, not yet knowing what to say. Feeling the tension from the moment, I tried to lighten it by adding what I considered ‚Äúthe good part.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ It wasn‚Äôt all bad. My grandpa made a lot of money in the stock market before the dotcom crash in 2000. He died a couple of years later and left it to my dad. Since he didn‚Äôt have a will, my brother Josh and I received it as an inheritance when he died and split it. So, I guess the good thing about it is that I don‚Äôt have to worry about money anymore hehe.‚Äù I gave a slight chuckle, trying to relax the mood.

‚ÄúWhere is your brother now?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúLast I heard, he had joined the army and was stationed in Fort Benning. He always wanted to be in the army. He was always talking about how he wanted to make a difference and jump out of planes. I never really understood it, but it made him happy.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least he is doing something that he likes.‚Äù She responded.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I guess so.‚Äù

We walked a little further down the trail, silent. The conversation weighed heavily in the air between us. As the sun started to fall, she finally spoke up again.

‚ÄúThe Harvest Festival is coming up soon,‚Äù she said, kicking at the gravel on the trailside. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the biggest event Indigo Falls has. Everyone will be there. It‚Äôs a... tradition.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of tradition?‚Äù I asked.

She hesitated, eyes flicking to the woods.

‚ÄúOld stories. Old songs. You‚Äôll see‚Ä¶ Will you go with me?‚Äù she asked, looking up at me with her intoxicating green eyes.

‚ÄúOf course I will!‚Äù I responded quickly.

The walks I had with Clara were renewing my soul little by little. Each time we were together, I could feel a powerful warmth wash over me, and then I became calm. The townsfolk, however, weren‚Äôt as welcoming as she was. I stopped by the grocery store after mine and Clara‚Äôs hike to grab a few things for dinner. When I came through the door, I could see Jimmy, the clerk, standing behind the counter.

Since I had moved in, he was always there, no matter the time of day. It seemed like all Jimmy did was work. As I walked by him, I nodded in his direction with a half-smile. He barely looked at me. He was a nice guy, by my estimation. The times I had come in before, he was pleasant and helpful. Something was different this time‚Ä¶ something was wrong.

‚ÄúWhatcha need?‚Äù he said with a monotonous groan.

‚ÄúA few things,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust a few essentials for next week.‚Äù

He shoved the items across the counter, making no eye contact. When I tried to make conversation, he would cut me off or ask an abrupt question.

‚ÄúThat all?‚Äù he asked, his expression becoming more irritated.

‚ÄúY-Yea I guess so...‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúGood, that‚Äôll be $36.78. Cash only.‚Äù

Caught off guard by this, I quickly reached into my pocket, fumbling for the bills. He had never done this before. He always lets me use my debit card. Why was he asking for cash only? When I pulled my hand out, all I had was a 20 and a 10, accompanied by a wad of matted pocket lint. I held the money up toward Jimmy, mouth slightly agape, as if I were a mute asking if this would be enough with just my facial expression. His brow furrowed. With a violent rush, he sprang toward me and grabbed my jacket, pulling me close to him.

‚ÄúIs this some kind of sick joke, buddy?‚Äù he snarled in my face.

‚ÄúWh-What do you mean? I-I‚Äôm just trying to pay for my groceries. Look, here‚Äôs cash. It‚Äôs all I have on me right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúHa! You know damn well that ain‚Äôt what I said. I SAID, THIRTY-SIX DOLLARS AND SEVENTY-EIGHT CENTS‚Ä¶ NOT THIRTY, YOU FUCKING IDIOT!‚Äù He screamed in my face. ‚ÄúIF YOU DON‚ÄôT HAVE THE MONEY, THEN GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY STORE!‚Äù

He pushed me away from him while releasing my jacket. I stood stunned for a moment. I had never had anyone in town act like this toward me, especially not Jimmy. He stared at me, red-faced, veins popping from his neck, fuming over the audacity of my ignorance. The fact that I came in to buy groceries without exact change was inconceivable to him. As I stumbled out of the store empty-handed, all I could do was think about how this place felt‚Ä¶ different‚Ä¶ changed in some way.

The air in town felt charged... like I‚Äôd walked into a spider‚Äôs web and the spiders were watching me, waiting. I noticed people stopping their conversations when I approached. The few kids on the playground would fall silent and glance away. Older women eyed me over knitting needles, their fingers tightening involuntarily, knuckles turning white from the force. It felt like I was becoming an outcast in a place that just weeks ago was my refuge. It felt like everybody was starting to hate me for some reason.

The next night, after Clara closed the diner, I invited her to my porch for a few drinks. The sky was a patchwork of stars behind the dark silhouettes of trees. The crickets provided the perfect ambience for her pleasant company.

‚ÄúDid you hear how Jimmy acted toward me yesterday?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYeah, it was all he could talk about when he came in for dinner last night.‚Äù She responded.

‚ÄúI had some weird encounters with the folks in town as well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ strange lately.‚Äù

She lowered her head, staring at her glass. She ran her finger around the edge slowly as if she were in a trance.

‚ÄúWhy do you think they act like that?‚Äù I asked, taking a sip of a beer.

She looked out into the woods, tracing a pattern on the weathered trees.

‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre scared,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúScared of change‚Ä¶ of outsiders. Indigo Falls likes its secrets. It‚Äôs how they keep the town... safe and healthy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSafe from what?‚Äù

Her eyes met mine, filled with sadness I couldn‚Äôt place.

‚ÄúFrom what‚Äôs in these hills.‚Äù

These hills? I pondered‚Ä¶ my eyes slowly scanning the darkness.

The more I stared into them, the more they felt alive. I could feel them watching... breathing. Strange sounds echoed in the distance... a low hum‚Ä¶ the snap of twigs... not animals, something else. The mystery of the hills around me had become front and center in my mind. I couldn‚Äôt place it, but something had shifted in the air, and it was starting to cause my little piece of heaven to crumble right in front of me.

‚ÄúIs there anything I can do to stop it?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ these folks have been here a long time‚Ä¶ and I do mean a very long time‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt like anybody coming in that they don‚Äôt know.‚Äù She continued. ‚ÄúEvery year around the harvest festival, it gets this way. It will pass, and they will get back to normal. It‚Äôs just an old tradition that started a long time ago, and people never really let it go.‚Äù

My eyes searched her face as she spoke. Her words reassured me. There was nothing that Clara couldn‚Äôt fix in my mind. I just had to endure this weird ‚Äútradition‚Äù of outsider hazing or whatever they wanted to call it, and then hopefully we could get back to normal.

The rest of the night after our conversation was routine. Clara and I spent the evening swapping stories and laughing with one another well into the night. The idea of the hills having secrets stuck with me, however. My mind couldn‚Äôt erase the look on Jimmy‚Äôs face when he grabbed me. He had true hate in his eyes. I hadn‚Äôt seen that look since my dad was alive. I needed to focus on more important things to get my mind off it.

The next day, I made my way down to Gene‚Äôs general store to purchase some nails and boards for the cabin. The railing was getting on my nerves and would give me a nasty splinter every time I tried to grab it. Entering the store for the first time, I could hear the tired, old speaker behind the counter playing old music. It sounded like slow jazz‚Ä¶ something old. I grabbed my items and approached the counter.

‚ÄúGood morning, sir. I hope you found what you were looking for.‚Äù The man said in an upbeat and jolly tone.

‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶ Yeah‚Ä¶ I did. Do you‚Äî‚Äù

He cut me off before I could finish asking my question.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be $16.25, sir.‚Äù He announced with a wide smile.

¬†‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶. Ok‚Ä¶ Do you take debit cards?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTsk‚Ä¶ No, I‚Äôm afraid not, sir. Cash only here. Sorry about that.‚Äù The man responded, clicking his tongue against his teeth.

‚ÄúNo worries, I have some cash on me.‚Äù I quickly responded. I had prepared for this scenario ever since the Jimmy situation happened.

I pulled out a handful of bills and began counting the total on the counter. As I counted the bills in front of him, his eyes left my face and slowly rolled down to the counter below. Still smiling, his face started turning pink‚Ä¶ and then red‚Ä¶ his eyes started bulging from their sockets, and he began gritting his teeth so hard that I could hear them grinding behind his smile. Suddenly, he slammed his hand down against the counter, rattling the coins and flattening the bills I had placed.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a bank‚Ä¶ sir.‚Äù The man said through gritted teeth, still trying to hold his smile.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to count exact change for you. I know you need exac‚Äî‚Äù

He cut me off again before I could finish.

‚ÄúLike I said‚Ä¶ This is NOT A BANK‚Ä¶‚Ä¶SIR!‚Äù His face was now blood-red, and his eyes stared at me with pure vitriol.

‚ÄúOk, ok, no problem, man, easy. I don‚Äôt want any issues here.‚Äù

He stared at me, his hand shaking with anger, clenching the bills on the counter. Then, as quickly as the anger flared, it vanished, replaced by a chilling silence. The old radio had become more apparent now. An old jazz tune had become the background of our staring contest. A slow, almost predatory smile spread across his face before he spoke.

""You know too much,"" he remarked, his voice dangerously gleeful.

‚ÄúWhat? What do you mean I know too much?‚Äù I asked, full of confusion.

‚ÄúHave a wonderful day, sir, and remember, don‚Äôt nix it, Gene can fix it!‚Äù He answered, not acknowledging my question.

I turned to leave. As I made it outside the store doors, I looked back through the window. There, I saw Gene still standing behind the counter, that same smile plastered on his face, staring at me as I walked down the steps.

The next night, just after midnight, I heard footsteps crunching outside my window. I grabbed a flashlight and my revolver from the bedside drawer. I was in bear country, and I did not want to become dinner for whatever was out there. My heart pounded as I crept through the cabin, following the sound of the footsteps as they crunched toward the front door. The more I listened, the more they sounded like someone walking. This was no bear‚Ä¶ it was a person. The sounds were now coming from right outside‚Ä¶ heavy footsteps creaked across the slats on the front porch. I grabbed the door handle and, with a deep breath, swung the door open. As the door opened, I clicked the flashlight on and leveled the revolver in the middle of the beam. I scanned the porch and the surrounding area, but there was nothing‚Ä¶ Nothing but shadows and silence. The idea of a person skulking around my cabin did not sit too well with me, especially in these hills‚Ä¶ especially with how everyone has been acting.

The next couple of nights were more of the same. I would hear footsteps approach my window at midnight, creeping their way around the cabin until they drew me to the front door. I foolishly took the bait every time, looking like an idiot standing on my porch with nothing but boxers, a Maglite, and my dad‚Äôs old .38 revolver.

That Friday, I headed back into town to do my weekly grocery run, no matter how much I dreaded it. I knew Jimmy was going to give me shit, no matter if I had exact change or not. I learned my lesson quickly on the cash-only request. I received my groceries and endured Jimmy‚Äôs hate-filled eyes as I paid and made my way out to my truck. I loaded the groceries into the Bronco and started to hop into the driver‚Äôs seat when a wild thought struck me. I decided that, instead of getting in the Bronco and driving straight home, I was going to take a walk around town and take in the cool weather that was starting to roll in. I needed some time away from the cabin.

I walked down toward the center of town where the town hall sat. I rounded the turn on Quincy Street, head down, pondering the curiosity of this place, when suddenly, I was struck hard in the shoulder by what felt like a semi. I was sent flying, eventually crashing to the ground in a heap. As I lay on the ground trying to get my bearings, I heard a deep, raspy voice ask,

‚ÄúWhoa there, boy! You ok?‚Äù

Still dazed, I couldn‚Äôt respond to the question yet.

‚ÄúSorry bout that, son‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt see as well as I used to. Sometimes I just run right into shit and not even know it... hehehe.‚Äù

I finally gathered my wits about me and looked up at the man. He was tall and lean, his face weathered like bark, eyes sharp but cloudy, like they had seen things no human should ever see. He wore an old pair of overalls with a red shirt underneath and a straw hat that looked like it had seen better days.

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm ok. I should‚Äôve been looking when I came around that corner.‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúHeh, no worries, son. These days everybody is on that damn phone looking at stupid shit nobody cares about. It happens more times than you think.‚Äù

I laughed as the old man helped me up. His lips and skin looked parched and worn, like an old leather satchel, and he had one brown tooth that stuck out when he spoke.

‚ÄúThe name‚Äôs Tom. Tom Sheffield.‚Äù He boomed. ‚ÄúAnd you are?‚Äù

He stuck out his hand for a handshake.

‚ÄúElias‚Ä¶ Elias Smith.‚Äù I responded, grabbing the man‚Äôs calloused hand.

With a firm grip, he shook my hand and shot me a half-smile.

‚ÄúWhere ya headed, son?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I was just walking around a bit‚Ä¶ but I guess I‚Äôm gonna head on back to my truck.‚Äù I responded.

‚ÄúWell good, I‚Äôll walk with ya. It ain‚Äôt every day I get to talk to someone new, ya know?‚Äù

‚ÄúEhh‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs ok, I don‚Äôt want to interrupt your day.‚Äù I said in return.

‚ÄúNonsense, I need to stretch out the ol‚Äô legs anyway hehe.‚Äù

Tom walked with me back to my truck even as I protested. I was already on the bad side of most people in town for reasons I didn‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt need to owe anybody any favors or piss anybody off. As we walked, he kept a happy and carefree demeanor. We talked the entire way back.

‚ÄúWhen‚Äôd you move to town?‚Äù he asked, his smile slightly fading from his face.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here about a month or so. I like the place, but some of these people are just‚Ä¶ strange.‚Äù I replied.

He gave a slight nod and looked forward as if he knew exactly what I was talking about. As we approached my truck, he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and stuck one between his weathered lips and spoke.

‚ÄúWell, son, this town has some strange history. Hell, I live here and still don‚Äôt understand it.‚Äù

He took a drag on his cigarette.

‚ÄúI lived close to here as a boy ‚Äòtil I got sent to Vietnam. I wasn‚Äôt much the same after I came back from that. I had some‚Ä¶ issues at home when I got back and had to move here. I never felt like this place was home for me. I‚Äôve only lived here for ten years myself.‚Äù

He took another drag, squinting his eyes as the smoke encircled the brim of his hat.

‚ÄúThis town‚Äôs got its layers,‚Äù he said, voice rough. ‚ÄúPeople like to keep the surface smooth, but underneath... things aren‚Äôt so simple.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of things?‚Äù I asked.

He flicked ash onto the ground.

‚ÄúThings that people don‚Äôt like to talk about.‚Äù He answered. ‚ÄúNow you get your gear and head on home before it gets dark. These roads get dangerous at night.‚Äù

He took one more long drag off his cigarette and flicked it to the ground, stamping it out with his boot.

‚ÄúYou take care now, ya hear? Nice meetin‚Äô you, Elias. I‚Äôll be seein‚Äô ya.‚Äù

The man walked back the way he came, leaving me with more questions than answers. Confused, I climbed into the Bronco and made my way back home.

That night, I lay awake, listening to the wind twisting through the trees. Tom‚Äôs words swirled in my mind.

‚ÄúWhat did he mean by layers?‚Äù I asked myself. ‚ÄúAnd what don‚Äôt these people want to talk about? What is so secretive?‚Äù

The thoughts raced through my skull as I lay in bed, trying not to think about the footsteps actively crunching around the cabin‚Äôs perimeter. Indigo Falls was no longer my safe haven‚Ä¶ It had become a cage.",1,1749328839.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1l5ufkz,https://i.redd.it/jf4i1t50fk5f1.jpeg,Watch Out For Snakes,"This morning? Pure chaos. The kind of chaos that makes you question your life choices before coffee.

So, it rained last night. My kids, filled with the kind of energy that can only come from cartoons and fruit snacks, ran outside the moment the clouds cleared. I swear, they were out there for maybe 45 seconds before the screaming started‚Äîthe dramatic, blood-curdling kind usually reserved for haunted houses and sibling betrayals.

They come barreling back inside yelling, ‚ÄúSNAKES! TWO SNAKES! FROM THE TREE!‚Äù And I? I transformed. No pants. No caffeine. Just me, a half-soggy sleep shirt, and a Swiffer mop. Instant warrior mode. I kicked open the side door like I was auditioning for The Walking Dead: Suburban Snake Edition.

And there they were. Two serpentine demons, clearly plotting the downfall of mankind, entwined like some kind of cursed friendship bracelet, lying in the grass. I charged like a sleep-deprived gladiator, flailing my Swiffer like it was Thor‚Äôs hammer‚Äîbut with way less effectiveness and much more static cling.

Meanwhile, my neighbor is standing calmly with his dog, watching what can only be described as an unhinged woman in a pajama top performing interpretive dance with a mop.

I‚Äôm yelling ‚ÄúSNAKESSSS!!!‚Äù like I‚Äôm in a low-budget action film, and he‚Äîbless him‚Äîhas the audacity to ask, ‚ÄúEverything okay over there?‚Äù

Sir. Do I look okay?

Anyway, after about five dramatic mop smashes, I realize‚Ä¶ nothing is moving. No angry hissing. No slithering. Just two very unbothered ‚Äúsnakes.‚Äù

So I squint (still no caffeine, mind you), lean in‚Ä¶ and right on cue, his dog trots over, grabs the ‚Äúsnakes,‚Äù and proudly returns to his owner.

My neighbor, now clearly trying not to laugh, says, ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ those are just my dog‚Äôs rope toys.‚Äù

My kids picked the exact moment he threw it to decide to go outside, and voil√†: suburban horror movie.

So now I‚Äôve got grass in my hair, Swiffer battle fatigue, and the local reputation of being That Neighbor Who Attacks Dog Toys Before Breakfast.

Many guests live in the NW Houston area (2.5 hour drive). I think many will likely drive in the day of and stay the night. A few others might fly in from the northeast. Have our siblings as MOH/BM, no other bridal party.

Current idea:
- No formal rehearsal dinner, just a welcome gathering on Thursday at a brewery where we‚Äôd do drink tokens and provide food like pizza or street tacos. Is this rude? Should we make Thursday the bigger/more formal event? My sister/MOH wouldn‚Äôt care if we don‚Äôt have a formal rehearsal dinner, but his brother might take it as a faux pas?? 
- 1-2 hour cruise downtown (Capital Cruises) with breakfast tacos Saturday morning (time?? 10? 11?)

Thoughts? Our 5 nieces and nephews will be coming and are younger (all under 4 YO, 2 under 1). Is the cruise a bad idea? The boats have plenty of covered/‚Äúindoor‚Äù areas, but I do get a little antsy thinking of if it rains 

Trying to know our vague plans for these events before I send save the dates so I can briefly mention them on our site, but it‚Äôs also hard to guess how many guests will come (and on what day they will come in) before I send the save the dates ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èÔøº it‚Äôs not a big wedding, we expect it‚Äôll end up being <50. 

Should I just state ‚Äúwelcome event‚Äù and ‚Äúfarewell event‚Äù on the site at this point and fill in details later? I feel like I need to mention them so that guests are aware of what type of events are happening and can make their flight plans accordingly based on what they want to attend 

I also feel like the boat is too much to commit to for guests after the wedding and there could be a lot of drop outs if they‚Äôre tired etc and we lose that money/it feels empty. So maybe the boat on Thursday and then coffee+bagels or reserved group tables at a coffee shop on Saturday  ",1,1749328218.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False

Just a question about timing of meals. Towards the day of a big race event like marathon or big trail run.

More less timing of going to the bathroom pre race time. ¬†

Would it be possible to the day before the marathon , do majority of my eating more earlier in the day and do almost like an 8 to 12 hour fast towards the race time of marathon? With maybe just a small nipple an hour or 2 before the race?

Reason so all food I eat is digested and able to get all of my bathroom Time cleaned out the hours up to the race start? More less I often have to do several number ‚Äú2‚Äùs prior to race start from coffee etc?

Would that 8 to 12 hour fast be ok to do? And still have energy for the full marathon? As I probably do a somewhat carb load prior anyhow?

Una, i felt bad for her kase mukhang ang dami nambabash sa kanya sa comsec na minsan hindi na about sa sinabi nya, pati physical appearance hindi pinalagpas. Pangalawa, I guess tama naman mga tao na I think medyo matagal na si sis sa coffee shop and its late. Actually, inumaga na sya.

After meeting with my ex for coffee & we talked for a long while. Everything seemed good, as if we were back to normal. it felt good surprisingly. Idk what i was thinking, that maybe she changed, maybe we‚Äôd get back together. Idk. I just wanted those good times back. But She discarded me again. So then i messaged her a bunch & randomly showed up at her place in the middle of the night. A dumb decision on my end. This was something we often did in our relationship so not out of the ordinary for either of us. She‚Äôd show up at my place, i show up at hers, etc. Then we‚Äôd talk (usually me crying to then apologizing for not doing anything wrong) & reconnect, etc. So i figured maybe i could talk to her.

I realize i have no self respect for myself & i don‚Äôt know my own worth or value bc i so desperately threw myself at her again wanting her to take me back.. Im the problem in this situation. i get that. I should have never reached out to her or agreed to meeting for coffee, i should have never tried to pursue her after the fact.

Cut to. After i showed up. Some time after she called a police officer on me. Spoke to the officer & then i never reached out to her again. 

Few days later i get a call from my parents that she filed an order of protection against me.

So after hearing that i go to the police station & file my own report about how she followed me to the gym, stalked me there, threw a water bottle at my car, then followed me back home to try to pop my tires & keyed my car & then giving me a black eye that night after she beat me. I have all the awful messages she sent me. Some are from that night, some from others. I have hundreds like this. Here are some. 

Police called her & she denied everything. They said they can‚Äôt do much since it happened a year ago. I did file in my report the times she was abusive emotionally, verbally, & physically. But they didn‚Äôt seem to want all the specifics but just general terms of her being ‚Äúthreatening‚Äù. I told them about how i have in messages she admitted to physical assault & to damaging my car & said she‚Äôd pay for it. But doesn‚Äôt seem they could do much about that.

This is someone i deeply loved or was trauma bonded to or both. I never wanted to go to the police in the first place. I don‚Äôt want to get her in trouble. But at the same time, she is an abuser. & she will continue to abuse people. I very much believe she abused all her previous exes & claimed she was the victim. 

Of course there‚Äôs a lot more to this story. But does anyone know anything else i can do?

I was told i can file an order of protection too with the state county police station. I don‚Äôt necessarily want her to get in trouble but i also want everyone to know how awfully abusive she was. It really gets me that she can act that way toward me or others & get away with it.",10,1749327856.0,BPDlovedones,4,0.92,False

1l5u8td,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l5u8td/strange_diner/,Strange Diner,"Out in the holler where the kudzu grows and the forest is thick, beyond the bridge that runs over the creek, and a few miles south of the town, there sits a dinner.

 
It‚Äôs old as shit and has a small gravel parking lot that the church in the woods likes to use for its bimonthly celebrations, but it‚Äôs almost always open. (The only time it‚Äôs ever really closed was that one time a tornado came through. And even then, people were still able to get food from the back window.) 

If you were to stop by and pop in, you‚Äôd probably get just about what you‚Äôd expect from any old country dinner. It‚Äôs about the size of a short, double wide trailer. So, the interior is a bit claustrophobic, but just spacious enough that you won‚Äôt feel trapped. It has a unique‚Ä¶smell‚Äî like cigarette smoke and floral perfume had some fucked-up love child and decided it needed to die there. Pictures of unidentifiable people eating are randomly taped to the wood-paneled walls (partially for advertising but mostly to cover some holes). A flickering neon ‚Äúopen‚Äù sign sits in one of the large windows. They‚Äôre framed with old Christmas lights and let in a natural light when the sun‚Äôs up, but also allow you get a full view of the road, surrounding woods, or Lucky, the veteran coyote, as you eat.

 
He‚Äôs not exactly a vet, as he‚Äôs never really been in any war‚Äî not any major ones, at least. Just the on-going one that he has against the local farmers and their chickens, but it‚Äôs left the poor bastard looking like he just came out of Nam. He‚Äôs only got one eye, three feet, half an ear, and the fur on his tail seemingly refuses to grow normally. We (and by we, I mean I) felt bad and gave him a piece of some expired food, one time. And now, he refuses to leave. He‚Äôs been hit by at least three cars and two trucks (that we know of) and still insists on staring at people as they eat.

 
Another sight you may have the misfortune, (or blessing depending on who you ask) of seeing out those windows, would be what we have dubbed as ‚Äúthe sign dancer.‚Äù A hairy and rather‚Ä¶voluptuous man who will occasionally appear and pole dance on the sign out front. We‚Äôre not sure if he‚Äôs a ghost or just some dude with too much time on his hands, but we do know that his dances can make people feel things. It‚Äôs different for everyone, Mrs. Kelvins said she felt peace for the first time in years, while Mr. Branson said he felt ‚Äútrue‚Äù horror. However, after having watched the man dance myself, I‚Äôd say it was interesting, but mostly kinda disturbing. (Like watching someone chug expired milk.)

 
As for upkeep, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just seen as an aesthetic choice.

 An old, eyeless mannequin with a purple Mardi Gras necklace and a name tag sticker on its chest that reads ‚ÄúHello! My name is: Tomila‚Äù sits next to the entrance as a makeshift coatrack. If you get close enough to it, you‚Äôll notice it has that sickly sweet smell of rot clinging to it. (No matter how much it‚Äôs cleaned or sprayed with Febreze, it will not go away.) A cork board covered in papers, ranging from missing pet posters to advertisements and a few newspaper clippings, sits on the other side.

Booths are lined up against smudged windows and advertisements for local businesses are trapped under the clear, yet sticky, plastic coverings on the tables.

There‚Äôs an open kitchen, with grease-stained utilities that haven‚Äôt been updated since poodle skirts were a thing, and coffee pots that look like they survived Chernobyl. A dented mini fridge softly hums at the back wall, next to the batter covered waffle irons that strangely smell like burnt hair every time they‚Äôre used. There‚Äôs a milkshake station (It‚Äôs continued functionality is proof that miracles really do exist, and honestly, it‚Äôs what gets me through the day sometimes.) that sits next to the drink machine, where the stubborn, red sticky mess beneath it all has been fighting with the grease to become a permanent fixture. The checkered linoleum floors are cracked and stained in some places. Sometimes when it rains, a mysterious brownish liquid‚Äî that smells oddly like pennies ‚Äîoozes from them and forms shapes similar to human footprints. A jukebox, riddled with bullet holes, sits next to the bathroom hallway (Sometimes it ‚Äúglitches‚Äù and the screams of children come from it. Usually, it has to be unplugged for a few minutes whenever that happens.) and plays country music and the occasional pop or rock song.

 
I‚Äôm not one hundred percent sure, but I think the health inspector is either sleeping with the owners‚Äô daughter or has brain damage or (who knows) maybe it‚Äôs both. Like, this guy will straight up look at the weird black goop stuff in the mop station and be like, ‚ÄúYeah, this is okay.‚Äù It‚Äôs shady as fuck, but if there‚Äôs one thing we can count on, it‚Äôs that he‚Äôll sign off on this shit hole as being ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù like, pretty much no matter what.

 
If you find yourself needing to go number one or two (or three) after a meal or just in general, then you may find a hot dog on the floor next to the toilet paper rack. Its appearance in one of the two bathrooms depends entirely on what day of the week it is, though. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, it will be in the men‚Äôs room. But on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, it will be in the women‚Äôs room. It‚Äôs absent on Saturdays. And while we highly suggest against its consumption, we cannot control what you do. Having said that, the people who have eaten it claim it allowed them to have seen into the future for a few hours. Others became violently ill (just as we predicted they would), and were doomed to spend their evening in the very room they consumed the forsaken cylinder of meat in.

 
If you do stop by, don‚Äôt be a stranger! I‚Äôm pretty much always on the clock and I‚Äôm more than happy to take your order or sit and chat or both! I‚Äôm bored as fuck and my coworker, Kurt, isn‚Äôt a very good conversationalist. And there isn‚Äôt any phone service or internet at the dinner. So, if you have any important calls to make, you‚Äôll have to go out to the edge of the road. Or you can use the old phone booth! It‚Äôs pretty much in the same place. It‚Äôs next to the only streetlight we have out here, so it‚Äôs pretty hard to miss. Do be careful if you ever have to use it, though. We have the occasional hobo or crazy person come out of the woods to try and ‚Äúphone home.‚Äù They can get pretty violent, and as much as I‚Äôd like the show, I‚Äôm supposed to treat the parking lot fights as though they were happening in the store. The owners put that rule in place, and they review the cameras to make sure we break them up. And I really don‚Äôt want to deal with anymore violence than I already have to. (I am very tired, and I am not a very large or strong lady. So, breaking up fights is very hard for me. Please think of me and the consequences of your own actions.)

On the odd occasion that I‚Äôm not working, but you still want to chat with someone. Then I highly suggest that you be cautious with the locals. Some of them are lovely people, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôd just rather not leave Kurt to deal with a fight, should one break out, while I‚Äôm not there. Because, while Southern hospitality is a given with most of our regulars, it can still‚Ä¶run a bit short, if you know what I mean.

If you go in the mornings you may meet a fair bit of them, like Mr. Stimson, an older man who usually comes between the hours of seven and nine AM to order a few cups of coffee and a gravy biscuit. He used to own the old scrap yard. And despite there not being any big wild cats native to this area and the nearest zoo not housing any, he will tell you all about how his dogs were snatched, one at a time, by a black panther. Never mind the fact that he has only ever had but one dog. (It‚Äôs very sweet and follows him like a little shadow. Sometimes he brings it to the diner.)

Mr. Canterbury, he always gets the morning special that comes with one waffle, two eggs, and a side of bacon or sausage. But he gets the bacon instead of the sausage, because he claims that it ‚Äútaste too much like human flesh.‚Äù (I can assure you now, that the sausage is not made of flesh. We‚Äôre not sure where it comes from, but the owners assured us that we weren‚Äôt eating living people.)

Ms. Cleo Janice comes in late in the afternoon and orders exactly one egg, a thing of cheesy hash browns, and a strawberry milkshake. She always says that Tomila is ‚Äúcrying‚Äù and that the mannequin is ‚Äúsick.‚Äù Me and Kurt think she may be projecting her feelings and trying to ask for some form of help. But the last time we just up and asked if she needed any, she wound up getting a bit‚Ä¶violent, insisting that it was Tomila that was needing help. We‚Äôve considered banning her from the dinner, but she tips, like, really good. So, we just keep our mouths shut and give her the food she orders.

Then there‚Äôs Mr. Johnson. He doesn‚Äôt really have a usual meal, insisting that we should ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù him and give him whatever. However, he always refuses to drink water. He claimed our water had made him unable to eat fish. As every time he saw one, it apparently had his late wife‚Äôs face and would ‚Äúbeg him to stop‚Äù or ‚Äúlet go‚Äù with her voice.

If you have questions, then so do I. But unfortunately for the both of us, they will forever go unanswered. Because Mr. Johnson, the slippery bastard, died. They found him in his kitchen a few months ago, soaking wet. Apparently, he managed to drown while eating tacos.

So, to sum it all up, the diner is weird as fuck, but it‚Äôs become a major part of my life. So, I figured I‚Äôd start sharing a few of my experiences with y‚Äôall. ",5,1749327759.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Malapit puso ko sa mga hayop, and matagal ko na actually gustong magdala palagi ng kahit mumurahing cat food sa bag‚Äîpero lagi kong nadi-discourage kasi may amoy, tapos space-consuming pa. 

Pero lately, I've found the solution.

 I just found myself buying the cheapest 1kg cat food na makikita ko. Iniistock ko lang sa compartment ng motor ko.

Para lang ready, just in case.

And tonight, it hit the hardest.

Maghapon at magdamag ang ulan. 

Kanina sa coffee shop, may asong natutulog sa ilalim ng van. Binigyan ko ng cat food‚Äîand grabe yung iyak niya habang kumakain kahit di ko naman sya ginising.

Ngayon naman, itong pusang nakita ko sa gas station, same reaction. 

Yung parang ilang araw na talaga silang walang nakakain. 

Kahit tulog or tahimik nung una, biglang alive na alive pag naamoy na yung pagkain.

Sa totoo lang, ang dali na lang ngayon.

Sa lahat ng riders o commuters na pet lover din, alam kong pare-pareho tayong may compartment or bag na may extra space.

Kung may konting budget at kaya lang din naman, try nyo magdala ng maliit na pack ng cat food. 


PS: Hindi na ako nagdadala ng dog food kasi honestly, 
kahit dogs, mukhang mas gusto pa rin nila yung cat food (mas malansa siguro, kaya universal appeal? üòÇ)

Hindi mo talaga alam kung kailan mo sila makikilala. 

Pero pag dumating yung moment‚Äîat least, handa ka.

Absolutely did wonders so I am a functioning alcoholic but of course its terrible for you over time. Month off drinking now, I would drink as soon as I wake up kind of thing.

So my psyche put me on this Effexor med. Im also a month in on that at 37mg.

I can't tell if its doing anything or slowly making things worse. Like I feel numb. I still don't want to talk to anyone. No motivation or confidence. Interest in anything. Im just bland. I drink a shitload of coffee and throw an energy drink in the mix to at least get some sort of stimulation. 

Today im supposed to up to 75mg. And if im feeling like this im legit scared to. I've been messing up at work, like I get brain zaps a lot or just not paying attention like its making my ADD worse.

So I don't know. And what's scary is im starting to say F it, get off the meds and drink again but that is the whole goal here is to not drink and live a normal life comfortably.

So yeah. Idk what to do

Any experiences where its bleh at first but gets better? This is my first time on an SNRI. I've tried SSRIs but those were god awful.",2,1749327398.0,Effexor,6,1.0,False

It's my wife's birthday and she is not very fussy how to spend her birthday. The only thing that she would like is a (piece of) cake with a candle on it. And yep, it has been a busy day as we are travelling at the moment and I had no idea where to get her birthday cake from. 

The small hotel that we are staying has a small(er) cafe attached to it. I only realised that they belong together after the receptionist asked what we wanted to order. So that dude is doing two jobs, the reception and service at the cafe. (Fuck the greedy owner)

After a long day, we ordered a piece of cake and a coffee for the three (incl our son) of us. Not the pridest moment as a customer but we have been eating all evening and we simply wanted to have her birthday cake. 

So we asked the waiter/receptionist if he could organise a candle for us and I saw him running around like a madman trying to find a candle.

He eventually found one and gave it to us together with a lighter before rushing back to the reception. 

I ordered the bill and went to pay at the bar. Handed over 10 Euros and got 3 Euros change. While receiving the change, I gave my hero for the night another 10 euro bill as a gratitude. Secretive handshake, so that the other co-workers didn't notice anything. 

He was in disbelief. So was I. It's not me at all. Fuck tipping. But this man deserves to have a beer on my expense, so fuck it. ",6,1749327378.0,EndTipping,6,0.62,False

Every time I reminisce about us spending half the day together, getting coffee, laughing and the never ending conversations that captivated every part of my being, I always stop and think ""was that really you?"" Or was that the persona I built of you in my head. I always saw you as this amazing guy, any woman would be incredibly lucky to have, a diamond needle in a hay stack of shady men. Then you shattered that image with the accidental slip of the truth. I could never look at you the same after that, even now its tainted every memory. Was it all a lie, was it all just a game, the thrill of the chase then on to the next mouse in your sights. I miss you, but even when I see you on social media, in the paper, or when people often ask me about you, I still dont know what to say so I change the subject. I wish i never knew the truth, I wish I never caught that slip up, i wish i didn't ask you for the whole story. I miss you, but Im only missing a lie.

This evening I‚Äôm replaying the conversation in my head from earlier and because it was a really unusual case that was around a person‚Äôs faith community and their presentation, I am realising that if you knew the person, it could so easily be identifying information.

I recognise that I was so so stupid to get overexcited like that in a public place, and I‚Äôm worried that someone may have overheard and identified the patient. What should I do and how will this be managed, please? ",10,1749327256.0,NursingUK,9,0.92,False

Problem is, it's got this odd aftertaste that it adds to the coffee. Almost tastes floral? Kind of like a hint of perfume. Hard to describe, really, but definitely noticable.

I've tried cleaning it thoroughly, have ran vinegar through it, and the taste remains. 

Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks!
