Lets start from the beginning so everyone can have an understanding of the situation and really give me some ideas.

My boyfriend and I met on tinder around 4 months ago. Things have been great. Things started as just hooking up, then I would spend the night, then I picked him up from the airport, then he was meeting my family and I was meeting his family and basically for the better part of 3 months we have been attached at the hip.

I’m talking we stay at each others house a few nights a week, normally hang out after work when we aren’t spending the night together and we see each other on our work lunch breaks. ATTACHED. AT. THE. HIP. But i would like to clarify that when we spend time apart its really no big deal (we are apart while im writing this) Its not like we are on the phone 24/7 or texting every second of everyday. We just like hanging out all the time. 

Now my only problem with this and he brought it up the other day too is that nearly every second of our free time is spent together and we dont really have time to do our own thing and chase our own dreams. He also lives an hour away from me (we work in the same area just live in two seperate areas). 

My question is how do we spend time apart? Like do we make a schedule on when we can and can’t see each other because to me that sounds a little bit ridiculous. Because I am trying to save money and buying my morning coffee and lunch when I stay the night at his is making it really difficult along with just trying to stay on top of my own general life upkeep.

I really need advice. As much as we really like one another I don’t think living together is on the table yet since I just moved into my house, he just moved into his and not to mention we LITERALLY met 4 months ago. I want to hear all the options. 

My main issues at the moment are as follows:

I am trying to get back into the gym which is near my house (around an hour away from his)
I am trying to save money so the fuel money, lunches, coffees
I also know that space is a good thing in any relationship and I don’t want to become dependent on him at any point so I figure now is as good a time as any.
But also is this just the honeymoon phase of a relationship where we are just all over each other and it will end naturally?",1,1742905111.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1jjhz6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ObjectiveAlarming933/comments/1jjhz6u/4am_think/,4am think,"I’ve been awake since like 2 am. I can’t sleep. 
My mind is flipping like a playful dolphin through all aspects of my life and it’s hard to just lay there when my brain is so activated. 
If I can commit to getting rid of a few things a day (in my office), I may have enough space in my room for a double bed. I was going to get a twin but I’m turning 40. I should get an adult bed. I don’t need all this shit anyway. I almost pulled the trigger on a twin bed set yesterday. I was so angry. 

Since Friday I have been complaining about the litter that the cats track around the house. Thursday, we got yet another rug (this would be the 5th one that they have destroyed) and by yesterday there were whole chunks of litter coagulating to the textiles. The rug is cheap. I compromised and got a cheap ass fucking stupid ugly Amazon rug because I’m sick of them destroying everything that I love. I digress. I had hoped that by pointing out the litter rolling around my partner’s already sick feet… maybe he would make a connection? Maybe he’d be inspired to help with the maintenance and care of his home and pets? No. That is not what happened. He asked me to give him some sugar. I realize he was trying to make a bid for connection- I have been avoidant of all contact. But hot damn it pissed me off. 

I decided to not order a twin bed because I was pissed off. Like I said, I want a double. I have to make room for my crafts. lol. 

Yesterday was hard. Professionally I am completely uninspired. How do people stay at jobs for 10 + years?! Is it complacency? And if so…. How do i get that? And why do i resist it so? Do I just want to be chronically unhappy? Is that it? I have the best job. I really do. I work with the best people. But lately, it has been a challenge. 
I can’t fuck this job up. I have to find a way to get over this hump. 

I’m just burned out man. 

I’m overwhelmed by the care of the cats. It’s like having children. I had no idea that they were so messy. No clue. I had no idea that they would impact my lifestyle so fucking much. I had no idea that I would end up giving so much of a fuck about their grooming and their enrichment and their health and so on. It frustrates me that my partner has not been a good pet owner. The cat box makes me insane and after I resumed all of the responsibility there…. I expected my partner to wake up and help with something. 

I deep cleaned the house Thursday. The house is trashed. There’s cat hair everywhere. Coffee droplets on the floor. The dishes need to be done twice a day as we both cook but have vastly different diets. 

I can’t keep up with the household chores. It feels the way that it felt when I had a bunch of little kids and a partner who treated me like a maid. There’s always a mess, a need… somebody always needs something. 

The problem is, I can’t enjoy my free time when the house is a pigsty. Even worse, when I bring up how messy the house is, my partner says “it’s not that bad”. It triggers the fuck out of me because when I first moved in with him he was living basically in biohazard. Which gave me a lot of perspective into his health conditions, if I’m being honest. I don’t care what anyone says, the state of my home is a reflection of my current mental status. Every time. In every way. This is an absolute. I’ve tried to have grace for the situation because my partner is really unwell. But. I’m also burned the fuck out. 

I think I keep ruminating on this because I feel guilty for pulling away. I feel ashamed of myself for not being able to do this with him. I want to be stronger than this… I want to be a better person than this. I don’t want to ruin my life AGAIN because I hooked up with the wrong man AGAIN. I fear for what could happen to my partner in my absence. I’m putting off this conversation because I don’t want to cause him harm. I feel like I have to plea my case before I can be granted release. The reality is, it’s not working and that’s okay. It’s not my job to bring my already deluded partner into reality. 
I don’t want to be a whiney ass baby anymore.
I think I need to start ordering him around. Which is not something I enjoy at fucking all. Which is par for this fucking course. 

It may be time to start steering this thing and I’m not looking forward to it. But I want to be sane too. And I want to stop justifying my feelings which are already valid. I don’t have to build a case. Literally any other person would feel the way that I feel now. 
If my struggle is the house, I can make my room my sanctuary and that’s what I need to do. That’s the answer. Instead of bitching in my brain constantly, I can turn my thoughts towards more empowering things:

Empowering things:
-converting my office into a bedroom
-saving money
-finding things to do in Portland alone(ACTORS SHOOOOOWWW!)
-crochet (a friend asked me to participate in her farmers market tables and I may…. We shall see if I can produce market quality crochet products)
-weight loss
-investing in other relationships; friends, colleagues, my dad (who is incredibly lonely)………Other 
-maybe plan a trip to Alaska?
-plan trips to Washington to spend time with my bestie


This are all awesome things and It’s not delusional to think about them. Or to invest in them. Or to spend my energy making them happen. 

When I was with my abusive ex, he was the only thing I could think about. And my misery. I don’t want to live like that and I think that on some level I feel like I have to plea my case for unhappiness. What do I need from my friend group? Permission to say “I don’t want to do this anymore”? My partner is a really good person, with an amazing, beautiful, tender heart…but that doesn’t mean that I have to stay committed to something that doesn’t work. And I don’t have to make a case for it. It’s out In the open. In black and white. 

Perhaps I would feel less slimy if I stopped this behavior of whining about my partner and instead, just acted in a way that supported my decision to detach emotionally as I work through a safe separation from my partner. Which will take time. 

I think I also have been struggling because my partner wants pecks on the lips and does things that indicate he still has romantic feelings for me and those gestures are unwelcome now. I do not want to operate as a romantic partnership anymore. I do not want to socialize as romantic partners. So again, with the case making. I don’t want to do this anymore so I am being a butthead and pushing him away. 

I felt rage last night after work. I’ve been camping out in the bedroom to avoid the cat mess and all the things. When my partner came home he said i could have the livingroom. I declined because all of my crochet stuff was in the bedroom. When I left the room an hour later, he was sleeping, sitting up on the couch. 
I asked him what he was doing. He said he was napping. When I asked him why he didn’t go for the bedroom, he wouldn’t give me an answer. So I just went back to the room. When I came out of the room again moments later, his head was fucking rolling around and he was snoring. So I moved my shit out to the livingroom. 
Why wouldn’t he just tell me that he wants the room?! I was placed in a stupid, fucked up situation where I was the villain no matter what I chose from that moment on. Argh!!!! It upset me so much. If I asked him about it he’d just say something like “well you are pmsing and you needed the room and I’m fine on the couch”. Which is insane and ridiculous. He’s not fine on the couch. I’m tired of being the villain. Somehow I have to take care of everything and be the asshole for it too. 

I feel like, in partnership, we are supposed to be verbal about the things we love about our partner. I think it’s important to build my partner up and invite them to see themselves as I see them. Likewise, I know that when those things are happening for me, I also feel competent, valued, cherished and successful in my relationship and it makes me want to continue doing the things that I am doing. I hate living in a home where I am the bad guy. 

Anyway. Shits fucked and I’m burned out. 
I think he is playing boardgames with one of his friends tonight. We will see.

my (21NB) partner (22M) and i have been together for almost four years now. we’ve known each other since middle school (so 10 years) and have been friends the majority of the time. there was some on and off dating in middle school but we got back together senior year and have been inseparable since. we go to the same college, work the same shifts at the same job, and were having sleepovers every night for three and a half years until we moved into a place together two months ago. i have my permit but not my license, and we live in a very rural area so there’s no way i can get around without bf or a family member driving me (i’m working on this). 

all of this to say that we have had a beautiful relationship, the start was very rocky as we were both dealing with medication/mental health/situational struggles, but the last two years we have very rarely had problems. we communicate well, we work together well, i could genuinely be around him 24/7 and never feel like it was too much. 

so two and a half weeks ago, i woke up fairly early and was scrolling reddit. bf sleeps a lot later than me so i normally spend the first two hours of my day making coffee, breakfast for our pets, and scrolling on my phone. i saw a story where a woman described her perfect relationship and how it was ripped apart when she checked his hidden photos. i don’t know why this piqued my interest, but it did. i’ve never felt that he was cheating on me in the slightest, he is the most loyal person i’ve ever met and he genuinely made me feel like i was so exciting to him that he could never want anyone else. but there were pictures of girls in his hidden photos. pictures of our female friends, specifically my best friend and one of our coworkers. some were screenshotted from instagram but some were nude photos. this sent my heart into my chest because obviously i’m thinking that he’s having a romantic relationship with our friends. but there’s an AI app watermark in the bottom corner. 

god even just thinking about it still makes me sick to my stomach. i scrolled a little more but i ended up panicking and waking him up asking wtf was going on with the pictures in his camera roll. we talked about it for pretty much the entire day. he said he didn’t have feelings for them, compiling porn is something he’s done since a very very young age, he tried not to make excuses but it basically boiled down to “this is a bad habit that i have been trying to stop, this will never happen again.” 

i know he was introduced to porn at entirely too young of an age, and despite having successful middle/high school relationships before me, he has always felt insecure about his “crushes” not liking him back. i’m really trying not to make excuses for the behavior either (as i also explained this is a huuuge breech of consent and i had previously had conversations with him about the dangers of AI for this reason specifically) but i really believe that it’s stemming from some unanswered sexual trauma. he’s never been creepy, never been pervy, there were never any signs with how he acted around my friends. i just feel so disappointed. i really would never have guessed anything like this was going on. 

it’s been about a month and a half since i found the photos, and they’re torturing me daily. sometimes i close my eyes and i see them, sometimes i see their body over top of mine in the mirror, i’ve been resenting my best friend despite none of this being her fault (i feel the most guilty for this) and same goes for our coworker (luckily i haven’t worked with her in over a month). i feel an intense guilt and shame for not telling anyone, for keeping his secret. if i ever found new pictures i would leave and spread the word, but i promised him if nothing else happened i would stay quiet. he has encouraged me to leave but i just can’t. the past four years of my life have been him. he’s everything to me. i really believe that we’re supposed to be together, i just don’t know how to move on from this. if i wake up early to take the dog out i end up spending anywhere from 5-30 minutes scouring his phone to make sure i know about everything. i truly believe he feels guilty about this, but there’s the part of my judgement telling me that people who get caught are only ever upset because they got caught, not because of guilt. i just don’t know what to do. 

am i doing myself a disservice by staying? is this more akin to addiction or some fundamental flaw? 

TL;DR: bf of almost 4years had his hidden album filled with AI porn and social media screenshots of my best friend and our shared coworker. lol.

I’m a 23-year-old guy from Southeast Queensland Australia, and I’m looking to meet a woman for friendship, good conversation, and maybe more if we click. Lately, I’ve been feeling like I’d really enjoy a genuine, in-person connection—someone to hang out with, chat about life, and share experiences with. Online friendships are great, but there’s something different about actually spending time with someone, whether that’s grabbing a coffee, going for a walk, or just chilling and talking about whatever comes to mind.

A little about me: I’m into gaming, weeb culture (so if you love anime or anything Japan-related, we’ll probably get along), and occasionally just zoning out and staring into space, lost in thought. I also enjoy working out and learning about finance—figuring out how to build a solid future is something I’ve been focusing on lately. When I’m not working, I’m usually watching YouTube, listening to music, or planning my next big goal.

I’m looking for someone local who’s open to meeting up and forming a real friendship. If we get along well, I’d be open to seeing where things go, but no pressure. If you’re someone who enjoys deep convos, good laughs, and just vibing with a like-minded person, shoot me a message—I’d love to chat and see if we click!",1,1742904680.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I'd get periods where I am fine and don't need them at all for months, then usually get a cold and get bunged up again to the point I need a prescription of prednisolone AND the decongestants to get any relief. 

I have a small nose and narrow nasal passages, AND a deviated septum. No sense of smell for 5 years except for a split second when I blow my nose sometimes. 

Lately I've had congestion that I've tried three rounds of prednisolone to clear. When I get onto the third day of a course my nose gets clear. Soon as I stop the meds, it comes back. 

I've decided to stop the damn thing cold turkey. As well as stopped drinking coffee and eating carbs because I'm clearly a masochist. 

Anyway I've been off the sprays for 3 months and still have 100% congestion. No difference. Is my nose permanently wrecked?

Do I persevere? 

Has anyone else experienced having to go cold turkey this long before seeing even the slightest improvement?

The bass shook the floor like a lazy god’s heartbeat. Deep, rhythmic, and unrelenting. Pale violet lights sliced through the haze of incense smoke and artificial perfume, dancing across glittering skin, gleaming metal, and fashion choices that would make a Terran senator spontaneously combust.

The club was built into the upper arc of a low-gravity orbital station over Lurex IX, and the architecture leaned fully into the aesthetic. A thousand textures of stone, velvet, hologram, and bioluminescent flora. It was decadent, expensive, and offensively alive.

Yamato Renji sat at the center of it all like a sun on a throne of orbiting mischief. His silver and black robe was open just enough to be provocative, his jewelry glinted like stolen starlight, and his cup of silver-honeyed Ylkin nectar had not been touched since it was handed to him—mostly because the server was still draped across his lap.

She was whispering something in Lucerran, breathy and sultry, and Renji smiled faintly.

“That’s very poetic,” he murmured, brushing a strand of hair from her brow. “But it would mean more if you weren’t saying it for the third time tonight.”

She pouted. He gave her a quick kiss on the cheek before he gently nudged her off his lap, turning to the next ripple in of feeling in the club.

Because someone was *staring*.

Not with hunger. Not with flirtation. With… *anxiety*.

Across the curved edge of the gravity-drift platform stood a figure. Tall, humanoid, skin faintly opalescent. Their facial features were elegant but asymmetrical—possibly adapted for variable planetary rotation. Their species was unfamiliar, but charmingly styled: silver cuffs, nervous shifting stance, and a glowing data-ring spinning slowly above one wrist.

Renji smiled lazily and beckoned.

They hesitated.

With a soft sigh he waved his hand again, this time the stranger lifted into the air and moved across the room before being carefully deposited on their feet right in front of him.

The poor... woman(?) looked moretified and terrified as she spoke. “You’re… Envoy Yamato Renji?” they asked in a lilting, uncertain tone.

“I prefer ‘Renji,’ or ‘darling,’ or ‘please don’t stop,’ that last one is my favorite, but I’ll allow 'Envoy Yamato Renji'.” He gave a lazy wink. “What can I do for you, sweet stranger?”

“I… I need advice.”

He perked up. “Finally! Something I’m *excellent* at. Sit. Speak. Drink. I charge by the smile.”

They awkwardly took the seat. “It’s about… a human.”

“Oh no.”

“I—I mean that in a good way. I think I’m in love with one.”

“Oh *no*.” Renji looked dramatically to the ceiling, then back to them with glittering amusement. “My condolences. Go on.”

“She’s part of your crew.”

Renji raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “Do tell.”

The alien shifted, nervous. “Her name’s Talia. I was working engineering detail on your *Kurokawa no Arashi*. She brings her coffee near the gravity induction nodes. I… I like her smile.”

Renji made a soft noise of understanding. “So, you’ve got the crush. But you’re not sure if you should confess it, yes?”

They nodded.

“Let me be perfectly clear,” Renji said, leaning forward. “There is no ‘best’ way to propose dating a human. It’s a gamble. An experiment. A glorious, flaming shipwreck.”

They looked crestfallen.

“*However,*” he added, tapping their nose gently. “Humans do like a few things.”

“Like?”

“Confidence. Flattery. Stories. And above all else—attention.”

Renji stood, circling them slowly like a predator evaluating fashion potential. “Here’s what you do. You write her a note—handwritten, physical. In her language. Not perfect, but personal. Then you give her a gift.”

“What kind of gift?”

“Something *useless.* Frivolous. A soft thing that serves no purpose. Human love isn’t logical—it’s absurd. You’ll need to prove you’re capable of absurdity.”

They blinked slowly. “That… seems complicated.”

Renji grinned. “Oh, sweetheart. Love *is* complicated. That’s what makes it so delicious.”

They hesitated again. “And if she doesn’t… feel the same?”

By LINDA ADAMS

When Eulalia (Ukey) Kubis first met young Frank Cabot at a box social in Sturgeon Bay little did she know that one day she would be guardian of centuries of heritage and culture connected with the famous Cabot name.

Sitting with Mrs. Cabot and her gracious sister, Marie Stephan in the living room of their home, looking over relics of a by-gone era and sipping tea from a delicate, antique Haviland coffee cup transports one back through time to the age of royalty and adventure when this nation was still in its infancy.

Mrs. Cabot is the widow of Frank Cabot II, a direct descendent of the famed explorers from Bristol, England, John (Giovanni) Caboto and his son Sebastian who gained fame in the 15th and 16th centuries as explorers in the service of kings and queens.

In 1497 the Italian navigator John Cabot, sponsored by King Henry VII, voyaged to the northeast coasts of North America. It is believed his course lay close to the 60th parallel which was, because of the earth’s curvature, a much shorter route than the course taken by Columbus. It was suggested that Cabot was aware of the advantages of the northern route and sought to promote his schemes to England.

In 1512 his son Sebastian was commissioned by Henry VIII as a cartographer to accompany the English army to France. He was later given membership in the Council of New Indies and made pilot major. Sebastian later returned to England where he served in the English Navy and was appointed governor of the Merchant Adventurers.

Talking with Mrs. Cabot makes the distant places and names come alive. She has photos and drawings of the famed Cabot estates on Jersey Isle and St. Clements (off the coasts of France and England) and can illustrate the pictures with old legends and tales about the famous Cabots.

Through centuries the heritage, traditions and some of the relics of the Cabot clan have been handed down to the eldest son in each generation. With the death of her son Frank III the direct line of descendants from the explorers ended and the family treasures remain with her.

Among the most prized pieces of glass and silver are a pair of delicate stone plates bearing handpainted figures of a man and woman just as distinct and bright as the day they were painted. This priceless pair of plates is registered as 500 years old.

According to Mrs. Cabot the plates were already 100 years old when they were used by John and Sebastian at their Jersey Isle estate. Now that there are no more direct descendants Mrs. Cabot says she intends to leave the historical plates to a museum.

[Mrs. Eulalia Cabot displays a pair of priceless, antique china plates that originally belonged to the explorer John Cabot over four centuries ago.](https://preview.redd.it/2let4a230sqe1.png?width=1381&format=png&auto=webp&s=56ba8ab3e5243926feb4a3d021e1cfc48cb511fa)

Besides the cherished plates she has also inherited some beautiful pieces of cut glass, sets of Haviland and Limoges china and select articles of silver and furniture from the Cabot family.

The Cabot fame was not limited to the explorers. Cabots have established themselves many times through the centuries. Indeed in more recent years some Door county residents might remember Frank I and his wife Marie, who owned and built the resort at Cabot’s Point.

Frank Cabot sr. was well known in publishing circles in the early 1900s as the “King of Advertisers.” His wife, the former \[Ella Marie\] Stephenson, was a woman’s magazine writer and designer of national reputation. Before moving to Door county with her husband and sons Frank II and Harold in 1912 she was assistant editor of Woman’s Magazine and the Woman’s Farm Journal.

The Cabots bought Cabot’s Point at Idlewild in 1912 and built the resort there in 1915. Mrs. Cabot remembers her husband’s parents fondly as they had no daughters and she was their only daughter-in-law.

A former Sturgeon Bay school teacher Mrs. Cabot becomes animated as she talks about her husband’s family. She still proudly wears some lovely pieces of cameo jewelry given to her by her mother-in-law.

After the deaths of her husband and son she has remained the sole heir of the treasures centuries of Cabots have accumulated. Most of the priceless pieces have been put away for safekeeping or given to relatives but she and Mrs. Stephan still make regular use of the tea sets, crystal punch bowl and the silver serving pots.

Hearing Mrs. Cabot reminisce about her husband’s ancestors one has the feeling that if the Cabots had personally selected someone to uphold the Cabot heritage and bear the proud name they couldn’t have come up with anyone more devoted to the family than Eulalia Cabot.

Two of the biggest names in the field are Professor of Neuroscience Matthew Walker and leading biochemist and medical writer Stephen Cherniske M.S. 

Now, Stephen Cherniske wrote the book Caffeine Blues, which is literally ""the Book"" on quitting caffeine. The book goes into phenomenal detail about its dangers, the culture of denial, the many many health implications of the worlds favorite legal drug. 

Matthew Walker has dozens of podcasts, TED talks and various presentations online where he too goes into phenomenal detail about the science of sleep and brain activity and the negative effects caffeine and anxiety can, and very much, do have on sleep. 

Both of these writers were completely caffeine free. Until recently. 

In the last few years Stephen Cherniske has reported that he now drinks upwards of 3 coffees a day. 

Matthew Walker, who used to drink only decaf, now says he drinks a regular coffee in the morning. 

Cigarettes used to be all over the media because cigarette companies wanted you to buy their product. Matthew Walker has mentioned something along the lines of 'coffee now is where cigarettes were 50 years ago. The science is out, but the general population aren't interested in hearing it.'

The caffeine industry is huge. The second biggest traded commodity in the world behind oil. And these two astronomically educated anti caffeine experts are suddenly advocating for caffeine. It feels a little off. There is huge money in caffeine, and the big players wouldn't take too kindly to these highly influential people hurting their profits. Could they be getting pushed around to say what the companies want them to say? It kind of feels like it. ",5,1742904022.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

my (21NB) partner (22M) and i have been together for almost four years now. we’ve known each other since middle school (so 10 years) and have been friends the majority of the time. there was some on and off dating in middle school but we got back together senior year and have been inseparable since. we go to the same college, work the same shifts at the same job, and were having sleepovers every night for three and a half years until we moved into a place together two months ago. i have my permit but not my license, and we live in a very rural area so there’s no way i can get around without bf or a family member driving me (i’m working on this). 

all of this to say that we have had a beautiful relationship, the start was very rocky as we were both dealing with medication/mental health/situational struggles, but the last two years we have very rarely had problems. we communicate well, we work together well, i could genuinely be around him 24/7 and never feel like it was too much. 

so two and a half weeks ago, i woke up fairly early and was scrolling reddit. bf sleeps a lot later than me so i normally spend the first two hours of my day making coffee, breakfast for our pets, and scrolling on my phone. i saw a story where a woman described her perfect relationship and how it was ripped apart when she checked his hidden photos. i don’t know why this piqued my interest, but it did. 
i’ve never felt that he was cheating on me in the slightest, he is the most loyal person i’ve ever met and he genuinely made me feel like i was so exciting to him that he could never want anyone else. but there were pictures of girls in his hidden photos. pictures of our female friends, specifically my best friend and one of our coworkers. some were screenshotted from instagram but some were nude photos. this sent my heart into my chest because obviously i’m thinking that he’s having a romantic relationship with our friends. but there’s an AI app watermark in the bottom corner. 
god even just thinking about it still makes me sick to my stomach. i scrolled a little more but i ended up panicking and waking him up asking wtf was going on with the pictures in his camera roll. we talked about it for pretty much the entire day. he said he didn’t have feelings for them, compiling porn is something he’s done since a very very young age, he tried not to make excuses but it basically boiled down to “this is a bad habit that i have been trying to stop, this will never happen again.” i know he was introduced to porn at entirely too young of an age, and despite having successful middle/high school relationships before me, he has always felt insecure about his “crushes” not liking him back. i’m really trying not to make excuses for the behavior either (as i also explained this is a huuuge breech of consent and i had previously had conversations with him about the dangers of AI for this reason specifically) but i really believe that it’s stemming from some unanswered sexual trauma. 

he’s never been creepy, never been pervy, there were never any signs with how he acted around my friends. i just feel so disappointed. i really would never have guessed anything like this was going on. 

it’s been about a month and a half since i found the photos, and they’re torturing me daily. sometimes i close my eyes and i see them, sometimes i see their body over top of mine in the mirror, i’ve been resenting my best friend despite none of this being her fault (i feel the most guilty for this) and same goes for our coworker (luckily i haven’t worked with her in over a month). i feel an intense guilt and shame for not telling anyone, for keeping his secret. if i ever found new pictures i would leave and spread the word, but i promised him if nothing else happened i would stay quiet. he has encouraged me to leave but i just can’t. the past four years of my life have been him. he’s everything to me. i really believe that we’re supposed to be together, i just don’t know how to move on from this. if i wake up early to take the dog out i end up spending anywhere from 5-30 minutes scouring his phone to make sure i know about everything. i truly believe he feels guilty about this, but there’s the part of my judgement telling me that people who get caught are only ever upset because they got caught, not because of guilt. i just don’t know what to do. 

am i doing myself a disservice by staying? is this something more akin to addiction, where he can get help?

In reality, no matter what they choose, it benefits you.

For example, let’s say you own a small coffee shop and you want customers to buy more expensive drinks. Instead of just saying, “Buy this $7 latte,” you offer two options:

	1.	A plain coffee for $4
	2.	A fancy latte for $7 that comes with a free cookie

Most people will pick the second option because they feel like they’re getting a better deal even though you wanted them to spend more in the first place. You made them feel like they had control, but you were really guiding them toward the choice you wanted.

This law is all about framing choices in a way that gives you the advantage while making others believe they are in control.",8,1742903486.0,48lawsofpower,2,1.0,False

“Ah, ENFPs—the sparkling confetti of the Myers-Briggs world. Let's start with the Assertive ENFP (ENFP-A), the life of the party that no one actually invited. They burst into a room like a human glitter bomb, leaving a trail of sparkles and scattered thoughts in their wake. Their enthusiasm is so intense, it's like they've had three cups of coffee and a Red Bull for breakfast.

ENFP-As are idea factories, churning out plans and dreams with the speed and efficiency of a well-oiled assembly line. The only problem? They're about as committed to those ideas as a toddler is to a single toy in a room full of them. They're off chasing the next shiny thing before you can say, ""But what about that novel you were writing yesterday?”

Now, let's talk about the Turbulent ENFP (ENFP-T). They're like a whirlwind of emotions, constantly fluctuating between ""everything is amazing!"" and ""the world is ending."" Their mood swings are so dramatic, they could give a pendulum whiplash. One moment they're on top of the world, the next they're wallowing in existential dread, questioning their purpose in life and the meaning of the universe.

ENFP-Ts are notorious for their indecisiveness. Choosing between pizza toppings is like asking them to solve a complex ethical dilemma. They'll analyze, ponder, and debate until the pizza place closes, leaving them with nothing but cold cereal and regret.

Both types of ENFPs are champions of procrastination. Their motto is ""Why do today what you can put off until tomorrow... or the day after... or never?"" Deadlines are more like loose suggestions, and their to-do lists are graveyards of good intentions.

But despite their scatterbrained nature and emotional rollercoasters, ENFPs are a force of positivity and inspiration. They're the ones who'll encourage you to chase your dreams, push your boundaries, and believe in the power of possibilities. Just don't ask them to stick to a plan or make a decision on your behalf.

So, here's to the ENFPs—the whirlwinds of chaos and joy who make life a little less predictable and a lot more colorful. Just remember to take their plans with a grain of salt and their emotions with a box of tissues.”",2,1742903477.0,ENFP,0,1.0,False

# Retrocausality

**Classification**: Supernatural Powers, Conceptual Powers, Cognitive Powers

**Type**: Thought-Based

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 1

**Summary**:

What happened when a young god got bored with the boring concept of cause and effect? Well, he will naturally try to change it for his own amusement.

When Saiki was only 4 years old he already understood every concept of the universe and tried to change them so that he could have some fun, thus **Retrocausality** was born.

The power to reverse the cause so that it arises from the effect, the cause is a mere formality, for the effect has already occurred before it even originates. This power alters everyone's mind so that this seems normal to them.

Ive completely forgot most memories of me switching / co-fronting but i still have some that could be it, not sure tho 😭. If ur more knowlegdable (?) abt it I'd really appreciate some help in figuring what was switching/co-fronting, not just the events i experienced but also in general how to tell between an alter and things like that idk how to word it 😭. 

1. Its the earliest possible thing i remember that could be related to this. So basically, i was 13-15 years old. Our class discovered that the fence around the school grounds wasnt connected to the ground and the bottom was completely loose. We just made a hole in it big enough for one kid to go through by tangling the wires together. The fence was covered by bushes and other plants so it took the teachers some time to discover it lmaoo. But after some time we were disscussing abt the time we used the tunnel to escape school grounds. Idk if its just bad memory or smth like that but i was conviced i was the 2 person who tested the tunnels. But everyone else said otherwise, we didn't argue abt it for long but i was still conviced i remembered it in a different way than others. Its prolly not dissociative amnesia bc how could escaping school grounds be traumatic imo. 


2. Skill amnesia. I was in a mental hospital, it all seemed lowkey chill. One day i got coffee and sugar for it, sugar was in a small plastic bag, coffee was in a plastic container. Idk why but i completely forgot how to pour things. Like i was struggling to figure out how to get the sugar from the plastic bag to the container. I asked some other patients for help eventually. 

2.5 this was pretty recent (few days ago). Idk why but for a moment i forgot basic math and was sure that (it was 23rd of March) 27th of March was gonna be in 2 days. Usually I'd realize my mistake soon after but this time it stuck around for a good hour or 2. Im generally good at maths and understand all basics from middle school level so idk what that was. 


3. Feeling strange when i realized i was gonna get some body mods. Idk how to explain this one in one sentence 😭. So the most clearly i remember it happening with my tongue piercing. I got signed up for it, im sure i forgot abt it after. Then the day of the appointment was there and i went with my aunt to the tattoo studio. I randomly asked where we were going and for what, she said im getting my tongue pierced. And then i literally snapped out of it and realized fully that was i getting a tongue piercing. Smth similiar happened after i got my navel pierced i looked in the mirror and didn't fully see myself, i felt strange when i saw my reflection basically. 


4. At times i had to look to remind myself which year it was. Yeah I'd understand forgetting which day it is but idk abt u its odd to forget which year it was. 

5. One day i looked at my yt acc desc. Bc i havent looked or fully remembered it for like months. I saw there was written in the desc that i was Ace. I just looked confused bc i had no memory of writing it, so i changed it.",2,1742903237.0,OSDD,0,1.0,False

TLDR: my symptoms are so chaotic and inconsistent idk wtf I have

I'm 33F and and have stomach issues... forever? When I was a teenager I has bouts of extreme stomach pain, so bad I would be forced to double over and lie on the floor to ease the pain, so bad I thought my appendix was bursting! 

Since then I have had chronic stomach issues but they're all so difficult to find the triggers form and happen so 'randomly' that I've kind of just been living with it. I suffer with stomach aches, bloating, nausea (this is the most prominent issue as I never actually vomit), indigestion, constipation, globus sensation, dysphagia and this is likely increased by my anxiety/emetophobia. 

I have been to doctors, prescribed PPIs (omeprazole), I've tried gaviscon, rennie, peppermint. Nothing seems to help the symptoms. Sometimes they'll flare and I'll suffer for weeks, other times I can go months with no symptoms at all - my diet is unchanged.

Take the other day, for example, I had coffee, a bagel (with mustard in), some fried/fatty dinner and was completely fine! Next day too, no problems. Then I'll have a coffee, a simple sandwich and a nice fish dinner and it's like my stomach decided 'nah that's too much take it back'. Why?? What's different? What did I do? 

It's just never ending and I'm not even 100% sure if it is GERD, doctors all say 'yeah seems like it could be try not eating spicy food' like that will make it go away. I've been on/off omeprazole for 10+years. 

I'm now currently cutting out: tomatoes, citrus fruit, dairy, coffee, spicy food, greasy food, and keeping a log of what I do eat to go back to a doctor in a couple weeks.

1jjheuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1jjheuc/pubtip_blurbs_my_experience_as_a_debut_author/,"[PubTip] Blurbs: my experience as a debut author, numbers, some advice","I'm posting this here on the off-chance that it helps someone in my shoes. I just finished hunting down blurbs and I've now collected a bunch that I feel great about. It was probably the most stressful part of the publishing process (so far) and also among of the most rewarding, and there's a real paucity of information on the internet about it. 

**obligatory disclaimer that this is just my experience, you might have a totally different experience depending on your editor, publisher, genre, personal background, blood type, star sign, etc. etc.**

**Background info** I'm a debut litfic novelist with a Big 5 publisher. I have no MFA but some literary contacts from undergrad.

**When**: My galleys (or ARCs, whatever you prefer) arrived on my front doorstep 6 months and 21 days before my release date. 
I started my blurb hunt in earnest when my galleys arrived. I received 5 galleys at first, but it was no big deal when they ran out, I just sent PDFs or asked my publisher to send galleys after that. I got my last blurb 4 months and 12 days before my release date. 

I felt like the timeline I was given was tight, and I negotiated with my editor twice to push it later. At first, I only had a month to hunt down blurbs. Then I asked and got a month and a half; then I promised a blurb from a Big Name author and got two months. So, it is possible -- just be polite and honest. Your editor wants your book to sell too :-)

**Who**: First, I leaned on my preexisting contacts. I didn't get my MFA, but I had two creative writing professors at my undergrad who I was close to, and who not only blurbed but also connected me with other authors who could blurb. My agent secured one blurb for me. But the other authors I reached out to were all cold emails -- I emailed their agents or their agents' assistants with no prior connection. If I hadn't had any contacts, I still would have been fine in terms of blurbs. I hope that can be some comfort to the 99% of us without a ginormous MFA network full of Pulitzers.

**How**: I took each of my old professors out for coffee and we caught up. They both knew that I was publishing a novel, so neither of them were surprised when I asked for a blurb. I have strong relationships with both of them, so I also asked them for additional contacts right away - I don't recommend being this blatant about it unless you're really close. That said, *every* author has debuted and *every* author has groveled for blurbs, so they should be empathetic about it, even if they can't help.

I also had a Zoom call with my agent and editor where we made a spreadsheet with all of our contacts. This yielded a grand total of one blurb, from my agent's acquaintance. I have to say that this method wasn't as useful as I expected, for reasons I'll explain later, but it is still necessary to keep your agent and editor in the loop about all of this.

The most effective method for me was *cold emails*. Yes, really. I collected a list of authors and found the best way to contact them on their websites. That list included authors who I thought were more likely to say yes (recent debuts, authors without blue names on Wikipedia) as well as some Big Names (authors you've definitely heard of -- think Salman Rushdie, Jonathan Safran Foer, etc.) Regardless of how established they were, I only included authors whose work I genuinely admired, and I made sure that each email I sent was both personalized and effusive. Here is an example of an email I sent, with the identifying details redacted:

>*Dear Agent,*

>*I hope that this email finds you well. My name is enano, and I'm a fiction writer represented by My Agent at Their Agency. I'm reaching out in hopes of connecting with an author with whom you work, Bigdeal Authorpants. My debut novel “Passing Gas: A Tale of Love and Tums” is forthcoming from Macpenguin on June 31. I wrote my university thesis on Mr. Authorpants’ stunning novel, “Heartburn Chronicles”; his depiction of acid reflux deeply resonated with my own experiences. Naturally, when my editor told me that it was time to ask for blurbs, I thought of him.*

>Then a three sentence synopsis of my novel

>*I imagine that Mr. Authorpants is busy and that this is a very long shot. That said, would you be willing to ask him if he would like to receive an ARC? If he is open to blurbing, I would be immensely grateful, but it would be an honor for him just to read it. I have appended a letter to him here.*

>*Thank you so much! Feel free to reach out anytime, and also to my agent at myagent (at) fakeemail (dot) com.*

>*All the best,*

>*enano*

**The results**:
I reached out to a total of 28 authors. 2 were my old professors, 4 were my old professors' acquaintances, 1 was my agent's acquaintance, and the other 21 were cold emails. 

Of the 7 authors I contacted through my preexisting network, actually only my old professors and my agent's acquaintance could blurb.

Of the 21 cold emails, 5 never responded, 4 responded with a ""no"", 1 requested a galley but never got back to me, 4 said some variation on ""I can't blurb but send me a galley anyway and I'll post it on social media"" (this is great and you should definitely take them up on this if they offer!), and 7 said ""YES -- I'll blurb!""

Honestly, I didn't need 10 blurbs -- that feels *nuts*, and I'm afraid some of them won't make the back cover -- but I had only heard two ""yes""es until around 2 weeks before the deadline, and I was feeling the pressure, so I kept emailing. 

Then I got a ""yes"" from a Big Name (again, think Jonathan Safran Foer) and was so happy that I cried. His agent said that he normally doesn't blurb but he was sick in bed and needed something good to read. This sounds made up but I swear to god this is how it happened. He read my book in like 2 days and wrote an amazing blurb in record time. I cried.

I figured that I didn't need any more blurbs after the Big Name, but the ""yes""es just kept coming, all from authors whose work I really admire. Two of those authors -- one fellow debut, one Big Name -- have been in regular correspondence with me since. (Not through our agents, but by texting or chatting on the phone.) I've gotten coffee with one and fully plan to get coffee with the other. They've provided me with a huge amount of mentorship and advice and commiseration, and I feel so glad that I reached out. It's SO surreal to admire an author for a long time and then build a personal relationship with them. That is the upside of blurbs, and I wish that feeling for every one of you.

**Advice**: 

-If you're still in school, keep in touch with your professors. Not just because they might come in useful in the future, but also because they're probably lovely people. 

-If you can reach out to an author('s agent('s assistant)) yourself, that's much more meaningful than sending the request through your agent or editor. 

-Make your request really personal. These should be authors whose work you've read and can write about with genuine admiration. Every Big Name author's agent gets a million emails a week asking for blurbs -- make yours stand out. What does this author's work mean to you? What personal connection do you have?

-Learn from my mistake and don't reach out to 28 authors. If all 28 had gotten back to me, I would have been screwed. (In a good way, but still -- these authors are using their valuable time and energy to help you out. They might feel snubbed if they don't end up on the back cover.)

-Don't reach out to an author just to ask for a blurb from her pal Stephen King. Nobody wants to feel used.

-Don't freak out. There are enough good literary citizens out there that you *will* get blurbs. Just reach out to a variety of authors, both newer and more established names.  

-Show your gratitude. All ten of my blurbers got physical thank you cards in the mail and they will all get inscribed copies of the book when the time comes. If you play your cards right, your correspondences with your blurbers can become lasting, meaningful relationships.

One last thing: if you're struggling with this, if you're freaking out and reading everything on the internet ever written about blurbs, take solace in the fact that *nobody is sure just how much blurbs move the needle*. Especially in literary fiction, but I suspect that this applies across genres. One of my professors said that nobody cares about blurbs. The other said that blurbs are one of *many* factors that decides whether or not she picks up a book. Blurbs also *might be on the way out* -- Simon & Schuster has done away with them entirely, and I expect some of the other Big 5 publishers to follow suit in the near future. 
I've also been told that blurbs are best at building *in-house* hype -- your publishing team is going to get pumped when the blurbs start coming in. But, in the end, there are other things that matter just as much if not more. If you can, take some of that nervous blurb-hunting energy and redirect it toward working on your next book ;)

Working there was the worst experience of my life. I’ve worked other coffee shop/customer service jobs but nothing I’ve worked before and since then have been as horrible as my time at the Target Starbucks.

There was a girl i got along with and someone I considered a friend. I felt she was giving me some mixed signals and was confused so I asked her about this and afterwards she felt betrayed and hated me for it. I’ll never understand why. One day we were cool and joking around and the next she was going around spreading lies about me and being horrible towards me.

She decided she was going to do everything she could to make me miserable, to hurt me, and she did. I’ll never understand how you can go from joking around with someone for 5 months to hating them the way she hated me.

She started being hostile towards me over every little thing, made mean comments towards me as a way to take a jab at me, started spreading lies about me as a way to cover herself, divided up tip money without giving any to me and was just overall horrible towards me. I had to deal with these things every day I worked with her for 6 months. Working with her, being around her was the worst experience of my life. I prayed that she would quit working there, that she would finally leave me alone so I could get better. But she never stopped and my depression only got worse and everyday it got harder and harder

Her best friend worked there and she had her start acting mean towards me as well. I tried to keep my head down and ignore it, I stopped talking to her but continued being nice towards her. But I really struggle with depression and have a history of bad depression and self harm and I hadn’t had any issues in years before this because i was doing everything right but if someone is intentionally trying to hurt me there’s nothing I can do to stop it

The depression came back after she started acting that way towards me. I kept hoping she would stop but she didn’t and it was too much so I hurt myself for the first time in years. I tried asking coworkers to help me and even made 2 complaints to hr but nothing helped. No one that worked there cared enough to help me, they saw what was happening and ignored it, it was my managers job to help and deal with harassment but she ignored it after I spent so much time helping her out. When I told her I was quitting she laughed, she thought it was funny that I was suffering so much that I had to quit my job

She made me think there was something wrong with me. So I hurt myself for the first time in years. I kept trying to get back up, kept telling myself there’s nothing wrong with me but everytime she and her friends pulled me back down.

The depression and self harm has only gotten worse and now I’ve been in and out of the hospital. I was convinced I’d never do something like that again. I was seeing a therapist and I was happy but if someone is doing everything they can to hurt you, to make you sad then laughing at you afterwards, imagine how that makes me feel, to be around that everyday, like no one cares about me, I was in so much pain and they laughed at me

Eventually I had to quit my job. I needed that job to pay my rent and bills. This hurt me and a month later I made a small one page post on Snapchat about my bad experience there and it infuriated her. I had a false court order filed against me

She put lies in that order. She said I was “dangerous”. I’ve never hurt someone before in my entire life, I’ve never been in a fight, I’m anti gun and I’m going to school to be a nurse because I like helping people. She painted me as something I’m not and this destroyed me. I care so much about helping others and to be painted as dangerous hurt me so much. I try so hard every day to be kind and helpful. It’s on the Internet forever. She said she was scared I’d find out where she lived and hurt her and her family and friends. I never once did anything to support this claim. I would never hurt someone and never gave her even the slightest reason to think I’d hurt her. I don’t know where she lives and never wanted to but she went out of her way to find out where I lived.

Her and her friend went around social media calling me dangerous and a doxxer and a stalker and none of these things are true. They started spreading lies about me all over in this small town. They’re following me everywhere I go and telling people I meet lies about me. Everywhere I go, every new job I have, they follow me.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I was happy when I moved out here but this girl and her friends did everything to make me miserable. She saw how the way she was acting towards me was affecting me and laughed at me. It hurt me so much because I thought her and some of those people were my friends and I kept hoping she would stop or someone would help me but it never happened. I made the post on Snapchat to stand up for myself

I was so happy and hopeful when I moved out here. Those first 5 months were the happiest months of my life. Then this girl started bullying me and it got worse and worse and now my mental health is destroyed and I can’t pick it back up. They’ve pulled me down so far I can’t get back up no matter how hard I try. They’re continuing to follow me wherever I work, I started failing in school more and more after she started being mean towards me and now I’ve completely given up on school.

I’m making this post because this girl ruined my life, and she did it all intentionally, out of hate. I love being kind and helping people and she was mean and horrible towards me and then her and her friend spread lies about me and filed a false restraining order, now I can’t even get out of bed the pain is too much. They made me think their is something wrong with me, I constantly thought that while she was bullying me and now they’ve convinced me theirs something wrong with me and that hurts me so much and now I’m having to leave school and go back home. I don’t understand how people can be so mean and horrible and not care about someone else. I tried to be their friend but they were horrible towards me and now they’re spreading lies about me online and I don’t know what I can do

Please nobody work at the Target Starbucks department. The people that work there are the meanest people I have ever met. There are 3 girls specifically who work there who did everything they could to be mean and horrible towards me, to destroy my mental health. I was nothing but nice towards them but these 3 girls were absolutely horrible towards me. They bullied me and when they saw how it was affecting me they laughed at me. Please no one work there

This post won’t accomplish anything. Some people don’t understand depression but after dealing with the bullying from that girl for 6 months, the constant gas lighting, making me think there was something wrong with me, laughing at me, spreading lies about me, after all of it they dragged my mental health down so far that no matter what I do now I can’t make the depression go away. She hurt me so much with the way she acted towards me and the lies on the court order I want to kill myself, I’ve tried, I’ve tried to get better too but I can’t, they’re still there at that starbucks laughing at me. But my life mattered too, my happiness my mental health it mattered too, they never once thought of me as a person. When I first moved here, when I first started there at target, I could come there every day and smile and be happy, I was so happy but by the end of it that girl had intentionally hurt me so much that I cant remember the last time I was happy, it’s been so hard feeling this way everyday, I don’t understand why she came after me the way she did, I’ve never met someone who would treat someone else that way. My mental health can never be fixed. They’ll never understand just how much all of this hurt me, if they cared about others the way I do they would’ve never treated me that way.

******

Setting: The [girls](https://old.reddit.com/r/Marik0Galsun/comments/1gh2cw2/student_bodies_the_feminizing_four/) (*Bethany breaks the 3rd wall* “Umm....WOMEN.”) 

Sorry Bethany..starting over.

Setting: The *women* are at [ The Cherry Pit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Marik0Galsun/comments/1glre3l/the_cherry_pit_amrita_yoga/), on the first Saturday morning of fall semester, sophomore year.

“Wait. Keith broke up with you because of porn? Most guys would love that you are watching porn. What the fuck? That's fucked.” Dana said, keeping her voice hushed in the coffee shop, despite being hidden away at a small corner table among the book shelves. Her Bonobos tank top revealed the blonde’s  ample cleavage, but it was her thrifted, retro, skin tight, low rise jeans that had all the guys staring at unarguably hot blonde's ass as she got her flat white.

“Yeah, that is fucked,” Bethany agreed, and leaned back to stretch, her ring nipple piercing obvious in her light impact, black sports bra, left mostly uncovered by her skimpy, cropped, red tank top.

“Well, it wasn't the *porn*, it was the *gay* porn. He said it was gross,” Stephanie emphasized, though it seemed clear enough the first time around when she said she suggested jerking him off to Yaoi.

“He said it was gross? Because it is gay? What a cunt!” Bethany hissed, her LGTBQ alignment agitated as she shook her head, then sucked on the straw of her vitamin boosted, high protein smoothie to sooth herself with a little oral fixation.

“Yeah. Absolutely cuntish,” Dana, an avowed lesbian with an affinity for cock, concurred, then turned to her girlfriend Tabitha, with an expectant look.

“Yes, totes cuntish,” Tabitha agreed, not entirely comfortable with the body positive language, but deferential to Dana. Not entirely uncomfortable however, given that the first time she hooked up with Dana it was after being told, *I am going to take your ginger muffin with my Feeldoe, and turn you into my slutty little cunt.* The pick up line that got them together, and still made Tabitha's ginger muffin wet.

“Well, sorry, but he is a cunt. You can do better,” Bethany said in a soothing voice that did not quite fit her venomous expression. 

“For sure. Totes douche nozzle. You can do way better, “ Dana inserted, and turned to Tabitha.

“Way better,” Tabitha agreed, playing with her fine, strawberry blonde hair, her puffy nipples looking like succulent strawberries to match her hair, braless at Dana’s insistence; and teasingly visible in her crisp white shirt that would soon give way to sweaters as the weather chilled.

Stephanie sighed. “Well, I want him back.”

“Why would you want that? He's a cunt.” Bethany blurted out, clearly mystified

“I don’t know. I am into him. And he rails me SO good. His cock is perfect. Hits the G-Spot and just grazes my cervix, but not *too* much. And he eats ass. And he likes to have his ass eaten. And I want him back.” Stephanie shrugged. 

“Wait, he eats ass, and he thinks gay porn is gross?” asked Tabitha, who had learned to love to have her ass eaten, and was something of a pillow princess in her relationship with Dana; which partly explained why she did not object to Dana’s relationship with cock, or her hook ups with Bethany and a few other girls.

“I know, right? That is why I thought he would be down with the Yaoi thing. And he never said anything homophobic before that.”

“That still does not explain why would you would want him back. He is a cunt,” Bethany insisted.

Bethany took her sex affirming feminism seriously, and reclaiming cunt was a part of it. Along with whole-hearted support of all things queer, never missing a Pride parade or Slut Walk.

“Well, OK. It’s also because I want to watch him suck cock, and I am going to get him to do it.” Stephanie said with a sly smile. ""Now it is a challenge.""

“And just how are you going to get him to do that if he thinks gay porn is gross?” Dana whispered, leaning in with curiosity.

“Well, Mark has yellow fever in a *big* way. Like he would not shut up about eating my fortune cookie, filling my Bao with white cum;  or talking about my tight Asian pussy and his big white cock when he fucked me. So there is this cute, twinkie Asian boy, Keith, in a few of my pre med classes. He totes has a crush on me. I had him friend zoned last year, and he was obvs tiffed that I give it to white guys and not Asian boys. So......I am going to give it to him with some…..conditions.” Stephanie revealed, giggling at her own plan.

“Conditions?” the trio of women asked, nearly in unison. 

“Yeah. Like I will start with hand jobs, and get him to look at some of my Yaoi, then gay porn. He paints my nails nails, he gets a hand job. We paint each other’s nails and he gets a hand job. Have him remove his body hair for a blow job, like Sam's ex girlfriend did. Tell him how much I love how pretty he looks. Offer him pussy if he puts on makeup and bra and panties because I want to see what it's like with a girl. Give him a threesome with a girl, if he is a girl too. ”

“Woman.” Bethany interjected.

“Yeah yeah. Have a threesome with a guy because I gave him a threesome with a girl...woman. Eventually get a twink I know to suck his cock. Reward the twink with pussy for sucking cock while Keith watches. Deny Kieth pussy for not sucking cock….until he does. And he will for pussy. He's super beta. It was just too soon with Mark and he was not pussy whipped yet. Then I flirt with Mark, and offer him a special Asian girl. He will suck cock, and I get he will put some cream in a Twinkie too. It will just take patience. I have 3 years.”

“Why not just FWB with the twink who already sucks cock?” Dana asked. 

“Because I want Mark, for one. And two, turning Keith into a girl... a *woman* will be hot.”

“That really is fucking hot. Turning a boy into a girl. Like...so...fucking...hot.” Bethany agreed.

“Why is it ok to call men boys, but not ok to call women girls, but you can turn boys into girls?” Stephanie asked.

“Because boys are all puerile, and there is no reason to think they will be any more mature in panties. And that is beside the point. It’s hot.”  came Bethany’s quick retort.

“Why is that so hot? I mean it *is* hot, but *why* is it so fucking hot?” Dana asked, and turned to Tabitha, who just shrugged.

“But it is hot, right?” Dana asked Tabitha.

“Yeah. Totes hot.” Tabitha agreed.

The women paused in silence, pondering the hotness of Stephanie's plan, when Sam arrived at the table.

“Hi,” he said collectively, and then asked Bethany directly, “are you ready?”

Bethany looked up at Sam like the cat that ate the canary, and paused for a moment before saying, “I think we should all do it.”

“Sam?” Dana asked, leaving Sam to tilt his head, mystified. 

“Yeah. Sam,” Bethany nodded, “we are, uh, going to yoga. Because it is hot.” she added, covering her tracks. “We should all go to yoga sometime. Are you going come to, uhhhhhm do *hot* yoga? It's *hot*, right?” Brittany asked Dana.

“Yeah. I definitely want to come to do hot yoga. Super hot.” Dana responded, nodding her head.

“Who would you bring to yoga?”

Dana pursed her full lips, pensive, her eyes darting from Bethany to Tabitha with her gorgeous red hair, to Sam to Tabitha to Stephanie to Tabitha.

“Sloan”, she said with a smile. “Definitely Sloan.”

""I think he might be gay,"" Tabitha said, reflecting on Dana's musing that Tabitha and Sloan would make perfect ginger babies. 

""Yeah, that makes it hotter,"" Dana said with a wicked grin.

Bethany stood, her Split59 Mia Rigor leggings making it obvious she was not wearing panties, and recalled the ginger boy from Hardin Hall as she grabbed her yoga mat and back pack.  Nodding, she finished the last slurp of her smoothie.

“Good call on Sloan. I will let you know how it goes,” she told her friends. “Let's go Sam.”

The pair left the Cherry Pit and crossed the street to the yoga studio for their noon 75 power yoga. Bethany look over her shoulder at the coffee shop, and smiled. The intention for her yoga practice that day already firmly planted in her mind.

It is the beginning of sophomore year at St. Dionysus University, home of the Bonobos. St. Dionysus is a selective, mid size to small Division I school located 1500 acres (largely unspoiled) in the mountains of New Hampshire. In addition to quality academics the school boasts excellent athletic facilities, a private ski slope and a golf course. The 150 acre lake is 55 feet deep at its deepest and hosts an annual crew regatta. They excel at Men’s Track and Field and Lacrosse, and Women’s Volleyball, Track and Field and Soccer. The basketball and football programs have seen better days, but still attracts some decent players who appreciate the academics, party atmosphere, and athletes dining hall that deserves a Michelin star.

The major characters all know each other from Freshman year of college. Now in their sophomore year, Bethany, Stephanie, and Dana (in league with her pillow princess girlfriend Tabitha) embark on an adventure to have a gender bend ~~boyfriend~~ girlfriend and make him go bi. In the case of Dana, Tabitha and Sloan, they turn him lesbian and keep Sloan, along with Tabitha, Gold Star. (aka, no PIV for either of them), but lots of strapons and cock sheaths, 3 way cunnilingus and perhaps some FfMm and Ffmm.

Bethany and Sam and The B Team  - Freshman year Bethany had sex with Sam’s roommate John, very frequently. One day she walked in on Sam in the bathroom and saw his quite modest morning wood. They later bonded over yoga. She noticed his interest in women’s fashion, and he frequently helped her shop, and painted her nails. At some point he confided that his girlfriend Michelle required him to be hairless from the neck down, and he has a panty wearing fetish. Michelle liked to tie him up. He broke up with her because she tied him up and put binder clips on his nipples. She is part of a conversation with Stephanie, Dana and Tabitha about Yaoi, and pegging. Bethany and Dana share that they got the perfect strapon, a Rodeo H double dildo and panty set, to fool around. By the end of the week, all the girls have one.

Stephanie, Keith and Mark: Stephanie intends on getting Keith to suck Mark’s cock. Maybe more. She handjob trains him to yaoi, then gay porn, and gets him to cross dress and accept her pegging. Prey’s on Keith’s asian fetish. Fucked John before she was exclusive with Mark. Plans on asking Bethany to be the girl…woman…in her first threesome with Keith.

Dana and Tabitha and Sloan. Plan to feminize Sloan and make him the 3rd in their lesbian throuple. Dana wants to marry Tabitha after graduation, and use a turkey baster to have red headed babies with Tabitha.

1jjha93,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1jjha93/no_weight_loss/,(No) Weight Loss,"I have been in a consistent calorie deficit of 1,650 per day for almost 4 weeks. 

Haven’t consistently hit 10,000 steps every single day - I have averaged around 7,000/8,000 steps on the lower days. 

Averaging around 120-140g protein a day (30g per 3 meals, the rest is from snacks) 

I've not been cutting out carbs, but having very minimal (I don’t really like pasta that much so I tend not to have it anyway, the occasional bagel, maybe half a pack of rice with dinner and that’s it) 

Plenty of whole foods (fruit, veg, legumes/chickpeas), plenty of fibre. 

Taking Berberine supplement and on Slynd birth control. 

Very hydrated, have cut out coffee completely, the only caffeine I get is from an English breakfast tea or a Pepsi Max. 

2-3 cups of Spearmint tea a day. 

How on Gods green earth have I not even lost so much as half a pound? 

I appreciate this is a process, it’s going to take time. I just thought my body would give me some kind of reaction by now. 
My partner tells me I’m definitely looking slimmer but my clothes, the scales, they’re telling me that nothing has changed. 

I’m getting so frustrated, I feel like I’m doing everything that research tells me will help but it’s not working. I’m over 100kg (107kg to be precise, if that helps) and I’m very short (5'3"") so my weight is extremely noticeable and I’m so unhappy with it. 

Am I doing this right? Is there anything you guys have tried that I could incorporate or change? I really would appreciate any advice at all.

**No More ""Just Coffee Chats"" That Lead Nowhere**  
With a website, people understand your services, investment interests, or business approach *before* reaching out. This means **fewer dead-end conversations** and more strategic connections.

**Set Boundaries Without Guilt**  
Your site can include:  
✅ Who you work with (and who you don’t)  
✅ Your pricing or investment criteria  
✅ Clear calls-to-action (so people don’t waste your time)

1jjh89x,https://www.reddit.com/r/DF64/comments/1jjh89x/whats_the_deal_with_setting_zero/,What's the deal with 'setting zero'?,"I got my grinder a couple of weeks ago, made a shot as it was set out of the box to get a starting point. It was too slow so I adjusted and did another, it was ~30s for 20g in, 40g out, done.

I only drink 'flat whites' so I'm no judge of the taste of a shot of espresso, but I can't see why this setting zero business is important, and IMO my coffees are at least as good as what I get in cafes.

I did a barista course about a month ago and the cafe grinder didn't have any numbers - just marks so you can reference where you are now and get an idea of how far you've adjusted which is how I treat the marks on this grinder. There was no slow feeding or worry about noise either - a big hopper on top, a decent motor, and the job's done quickly.

Plus, the numbers are meaningless based upon different bean types, age, probably other factors. The guy teaching the course said in a cafe you need to dial the grinder in each morning and then watch the shot times throughout the day and make minor adjustments as necessary. I'm not going to do that - I just adjust if I notice the shot is too fast or slow.

I don't care what the number actually is or whether the burrs just touch at a zero I'm never going to wind down to - why are people worrying about this with their DF-64s? Is it because people swap between espresso and pour-over etc so want reference marks for each type? Even then, 'zero' doesn't help - just a mark that will go under the pointer as a rough starting position should do?",2,1742902458.0,DF64,5,1.0,False

I keep getting rejected, possibly due to no experience no degree.","# ♡{PLS be nice this is my second post on here. (ㅠ﹏ㅠ)}♡

Hello, I’m a 24 ( 25 this April) year old female that is unemployed and ready for a job, but I'm honestly not even sure what jobs I should apply for.

In 2021 I worked at Forever 21 for approximately one day, before I slipped in a puddle of water on the floor ( leaking from the ceiling) and the employees and managers didn’t even seem to care. Only customers came to help me, after that I was in too much pain to go back and didn’t want to work there anymore. ( They sent me a check that was more than what I earned, it had a hush money vibe to it.)

In 2022 I got a summer job at Claire’s and had to quit two weeks before the end of the position duration because I couldn’t feel anything below my ankles.

I honestly thought the pain was simply because I was overweight and by 2024 I lost 85 pounds. So I believed that I’d be okay with a standing job again …..but I couldn’t have been more wrong. This time I got a boba shop job and after two weeks my feet were pins and needles. ( My mom told me this would happen, and I didn’t listen :( My grandmother (her mom) had a similar experience but I don’t remember it.) ( Also, I was in denial because of my age.)

I was in so much pain that I wondered if a bone was broken, but it seemed unlikely that bones were broken in both feet. I was taking Advil daily, and eventually felt they weren’t working anymore due to overuse. I couldn’t sleep because my foot pain kept me awake, only sitting on top of my feet ( compression) made the pain bearable.

The third week I felt like the pain was traveling up my legs and to my hands ( they started shaking, like I drank too much coffee) so I just quit. The manager at the boba shop was a snake too and tried not to pay me. To top it off the shop was super unsanitary and I felt an immense amount of guilty giving customers their drinks that even I wouldn’t drink knowing how they were made. ( Manager found a BANDAID in the ice and just threw it away, no throwing away the contaminated ice or anything.🤢)

I believe I may have arthritis but in my pursuit to get a diagnosis , the cost of the appointments is just too expensive. However, the community health care doctors I have been able to see have said that my foot arch is practically nonexistent and that I may have plantar fasciitis.

II need a job that I don’t have to stand for too long or a job where the “standing period” isn’t that long ( for example: with third party shopping companies, like Instacart, I’d stand to complete an order and after it’s done I can rest my feet for a while before picking up another order .) ( Instacart currently has a wait list :( .) If I could have any job I wanted (if standing wasn’t a problem), I’d work at a bookstore or be a library assistant/ librarian.

I love reading, writing , history, and learning in general, but I have yet to discover how to turn it into a job. I even consider becoming a YouTuber (I know I know, that takes time), but in the end that costs money too. I looked into being a receptionist and bank teller but kept getting rejected due to no experience (my interpretation). ( I quit all three jobs I had before so I don’t think they are useable job references.) I started my Associates degree, majoring in history, but it’s on hold now that I can’t access financial aid. In the meantime I’m doing classes on Sophia Learning that are transferable to my college.

IN SHORT:

Most of the no experience/ will train jobs are standing and that just won’t work for me, due to foot pain. I have no ( useable) job experience and no ( started but not finished yet) college degree. I love reading, writing , history, and learning as a whole, and wish I could make a living out of it. (Learn French online right now and loving every second of the process!💕)

I should also mention that I’ve been homeschooled since the third grade, so I’m a bit shy…. But I know how to perk up.

And yes, the job climate is crazy right now regardless of experience or a degree.

It has gotten physical around 1 month ago. He was cheating on me ( emotionally not physically yet) and we would argue about it a ton. Last month he was drinking and decided I was cheating on him. The reality was I was enjoying a glass of wine with a male co-worker…. While my bf was bartending. He walked out of his job yelled at me in front of all of our coworkers. Later that evening he attacked me in my home. I called the police on him and he was arrested. Because of the damage to my face and chest the state took it over ( Ive never had this experience before so I dont know if thats standard). We decided to work it out but there was a restraining order in place. Our job found out about the arrest /restraining order  and fired him.  So since then I have been supporting us and lying to all of my friends because I didnt want their judgement. it wasnt easy because we were constantly arguing about how i “ruined his life” and he was drinking a lot.  I found a job in a nearby town for both of us and it really felt like it could have been a new start for us. We could be open and both work. Two days ago we were settling in a dancing in the living room. We were making fun cocktails and enjoying each other. Yesterday he woke up with a mission to be miserable and drunk. He was starting to get aggressive so I put some space between us and left to run some errands. When i got back he continued to yell at me about how he hates everything and tried to strangle me. My mom tried to mediate and managed to calm us down. I decided to pour out the bottles of alcohol and because i did that he hit me open hands. He was throwing things at me ( a bottle, a trashcan, empty boxes, flipped our coffee table). He was completely unhinged and one of our neighbors called the police. I am covered in bruises but I lied and tried to not let him get in trouble. They still took him in on the count that the restraining order is in effect.

To start this off, I need to say that I’m almost certain my sibling is a narcissist. I don’t mean the term that gets thrown around today but the clinical definition of one.

My sibling (40 F) has helped me here and there when I was in contact. She would give me rides, loan me money, invite me out to food, etc. However, I didn’t realize until much later that she was getting something from these things. We lived together a few times and that’s when I began to notice it. Every time I would get fed up with being treated like crap (expected to pay half of everything in a three person household and have no privileges (Netflix, Hulu, etc) unless I contributed to paying it) and I would challenge her, she would start to bring up all these things she’s done and how I wasn’t appreciative of everything her husband and her did for me. Then it evolved to sending me to the store or out to pick up coffee or food. I would ask if I can get something, which I thought was reasonable. She would ask if I had money and I said no. She would refuse and I would still go like an idiot. 

The last time I lived with her, I was working part time and not making much but enough to get by. At this time she was also selling me her suv, which was beat up and had many issues. But it was a car and I had a toddler to transport when I had her on weekends. One day, she tells me that her husband and her are moving to a different apartment and I was not welcome. They wanted to live alone. I said it was fine because I had two months to get a place. She informed me that she hoped so because if not I’ll be homeless. I tried to save but she was still charging me while they were preparing to move. And they made me help them move. I ended up homeless for a month and half. Living in the suv. Begging her to loan me gas money so I could move it. I was suicidal. I told her I was and she told me I can’t do that to my daughter and that she was going to have me committed. I had to pretend I was okay because nobody cared that I wanted to die. 

I got a place and struggled to keep the rent going. It was 1200 a month for 1 bedroom and that was hard on a small salary and paying my sibling for that suv. It got to the point she wanted it back and I was at the end of my rope and moved out of state to get away from the situation and help my sick mom who I hadn’t seen in a decade because this sibling also convinced me my mom was a horrible person. After moving, I was told my multiple family members the lies my sibling told. About my mom, about my uncles, my cousins, my stepdad, and about her experiences. She lied about being raped. 

Now here I am, with a baby on the way & my daughter spending my weekends with my sibling. My sibling cut me out and I am happy for that but now every time I want to talk to my daughter and she has her, I can’t. Every time I want to go back and visit and take her places, I can’t because my sibling has already planned on it. Now, my other sibling who still talks to my mom and my sibling, is not cut off and also chose to cut me off too. 

I am at the point where I do not plan on reconnecting with either sibling when my mom passes away. I will move on with my life with my wife and children. It will be difficult with my siblings being connected with my daughter but I will make it work.

I work late shifts, and it’s nice to have some peace of mind.

Last night, after coming home around 2 AM, I did my usual routine: locked the doors, checked the windows, and scrolled through my phone in bed until I fell asleep.

This morning, I woke up to a notification: “Motion detected in living room – 3:12 AM.”

My stomach dropped. I hadn’t left my bedroom.

Heart pounding, I opened the footage. The camera quality isn’t great, but it was clear enough to see… something.

At 3:12 AM, my living room light flickered, and for a split second, I saw a figure. Tall, thin, standing in the middle of the room. They didn’t move. They just stood there. Watching.

Then—darkness.

The footage jumped to 3:14 AM when the light flickered back on. The room was empty.

I never heard my door open. Never heard it close.

I searched the entire house. Every door was still locked. Every window shut.

But something is wrong.

My phone charger, the one I always keep plugged in next to my bed? It’s missing.

And there’s an empty coffee cup on my kitchen counter. I don’t drink coffee.

I think they’re still here.

*Details: I'm 23 and in college, My mom lives in another state with her husband, my sisters knew I was trans way before anyone else, my sisters are no contact with mom*

So I called my mom for the first time after coming out to her as trans and told her that I was on HRT. The first thing she said was that I shouldn't have kept it from her and that I owe her and my stepdad an apology for not coming out sooner. She actually started crying and went ""Am I really that bad of a mother that you couldn't tell me?"" And started asking why I didn't love her and thought she was a bad mom. She does this kinda thing often its like a manipulation tactic. I told her that I told everyone when I was ready and it had nothing to do with anyone.

*deep breath*

After crying she then said something along the lines of:

""We still love you, but our only concern is you are autistic and I hope have talked to your counselor to make sure this was the right decision."" and basically going on about how she didn't think I knew how to make these important medical decisions on my own (I'm 23 btw. I may be young but I am a fuckin adult who pays rent😭). Also I had never told her details about how I started. She was worried I wouldn't be able to reverse HRT if I wanted to stop, which...no?

She also said ""Me and your step dad just hope you're not doing this because of ""my transmasc ex's name"". And also that ""We were worried you thought of this person as a man because he had female parts (respectfully he didn't pass at all yet but he also just came out at that time and I knew that). I had to explain to them how pansexuality works and that I will put in effort to see people however they want to be seen.

Maybe she's trying to understand? But I can tell she wasn't 100% on board with any of it, but we ended up changing the subject and she was venting to me about her health issues. She said me and my sisters are the reason her high blood pressure is dangerously high and she's scared to tell her doctor that, and blamed us for all of her issues. And eventually restated that My mom and stepdad do really love me and they wouldn't have helped me with my loans or give me money to help with my college expenses (job pays fuck all) if they didn't.

\-Should be mostly odor tight so the whole balcony doesnt smell.

\-Not too big maybe like 1x1 meters.

I dont know anything about composting except to put worms in there and aerate it. Im thinking either get one of those that you can spin (Dont know if thats good or too bulky and you also have to do it manually?). Or maybe put a plastic rod with holes in the middle so fresh air can circulate?

I shimmed my ESP Friday night. With no experience, I found a step-by-step video, viewed once, then played again while installing the shim. I finished the project in about 15 minutes. I was inordinately satisfied and a little proud to have completed this little DIY project. The design required no tools to break down and reassemble.

That night  I ordered a ""shorty"" single dose hopper and chose the standard 10 day delivery,  which cost a very fair $4.95.

**Saturday**

 Next day,, I ran an 18g dose through the grinder and at the end,  noticed a small cylinder/tube bouncing around in the hopper. It looked like a sleeve of some kind.  Thinking maybe I had screwed something up the night before when reassembling the grinder, I took a photo and sent it off to Baratza Support, which was closed over the weekend. 

**Monday**

I didn't get a response by 1:00 pm ET,  so I called Baratza. I was on hold for about 60 seconds when a rep answered the phone. I explained the situation and the rep found my email in a different que,  used for an old support address.

We quickly determined it wasn't a Baratza part but probably a foreign object that was shipped with the coffee. 

I asked if I really needed an updated  quick release  bolt/nut mentioned in the video and listed for about $9.00 on their website. She immediately offered to send one at no charge. I'm a happy camper. 

I got an unexpected package about 3:00 pm ET - still Monday I opened it and found,, to my surprise, the single  dose adapter I ordered Friday freaking night.

Holy Moly! Very reasonable parts prices, same for shipping  Can't believe the fast turn around on the ordered part  (Baratza is on the West Coast, I'm on the East) They have to have people handling the web orders on the weekend.

Friendly, prompt, knowledgeable customer support staff  No wonder Baratza support is legendary. 

And the coffee is good. I own the DF54 as well but  am glad I kept the ESP for batch brewing and a conical experience. Hoffman and Hedrick both evaluated the cups coming from the ESP and the DF54 being very close in quality.

If I buy/upgrade to another grinder in the future I'm going to have to look at the Baratza line based just on their superb support.

1jjgr2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1jjgr2v/calorie_deficit_as_fuel_for_insomnia/,Calorie Deficit as Fuel For Insomnia,"I've been studying my periods of insomnia to see what actually happens each time, and how it came to an end. In doing so, I realized that one thing that happens each time is that I start eating less. Substantially less. The last time I had insomnia, I lost  about 8 pounds in two weeks. 

Since anxiety always underpinned my insomniac periods, my thinking gets a bit skewed. In my search for answers to the problem (another recurring behavior), I'd inevitably start to think it was the food I was eating, or the supplements I was taking, or the coffee I was drinking. I'd become afraid to eat foods that were just fine and enjoyable before. Logically, I should have seen that I didn't have insomnia when I was eating it before, so how could it be the reason now? But the ability to be logical gets fuzzy and frayed.  

In avoiding this food and that food, or too much of a food, I'd end up losing weight too quickly. Gemini AI says this about calorie deficit and insomnia: *A calorie deficit, while effective for weight loss, can sometimes lead to sleep disturbances like insomnia due to hunger, nutrient deficiencies, and hormonal fluctuations.*   
  
It goes in to much further detail to support that cutting calories too much is detrimental to sleep. 

Coffee is not a calorie thing for me, as I drink it black. In a day, I use three tablespoons of regular and three tablespoons of decaf mixed together. I get about two full 16 ounce mugs from that. About 180mg of caffeine, tops. Not too much, but I will still go through withdrawal symptoms if I go cold turkey. I have gone cold turkey or cut down intake substantially during each period of insomnia due to the anxiety about it. Gemini states that insomnia is a common side effect of caffeine withdrawal.

Well, I surmise that these particular behaviors threw some wood on the fire of insomniac periods, perhaps making them worse and longer. The key takeaway from this is that if I start to not sleep, I have to try to keep eating and drinking the same way as I normally do, and not believe the skewed thinking that it's the food that is to blame. Or that it was the coffee.

1jjgp0d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjgp0d,The Mendip Way,"Hiked the Mendip Way recently - don’t see it discussed much so thought I’d give a little recap. 

Day one, 22.75 miles, Weston -> Cheddar:

We stayed overnight in Weston-super-Mare - easy enough to find accommodation but surprisingly expensive! - before setting out early in the morning. The hike starts on the beach which is a nice way to begin but very quickly takes you inland. 

Some decent inclines and beautiful views, especially as you approach Cheddar. The village of Loxton has a very cute community cafe which we stopped in for coffee and cake, but there’s not much in the way of provisions en route otherwise. 

The section from Shipham through to Cheddar is particularly pretty, as you end up in Cheddar Gorge itself. This section was probably the busiest section of the whole walk, but still not in any way crowded. 

 We stopped overnight in Cheddar at The Bath Arms, which was great. Plenty of food and pub options in charming Cheddar. 

Day two, 18.18 miles, Cheddar -> Shepton Mallet: 

Lovely mix of woods, country lanes and fields, again with some testing elevation but fantastic
views over Somerset. Ebbor Wood is a particularly nice highlight, and we didn’t see a single other person until we got to Wells. 

If you haven’t been to Wells before I’d recommend stopping a while, as it’s a gorgeous little city with lots to see and do. In fact if I were to do this walk again, I’d just do Cheddar - Wells on day two, and extend day three. 

Some gnarly elevation on the way out of Wells as you leave the official Mendip Hills landscape. We stayed overnight in Shepton Mallet which was fine, but very limited in terms of good pubs/places to eat. Ended up getting a Domino’s delivered to the room! 

Day three, 14.5 miles, Shepton Mallet -> Frome: 

Actually my favourite day of the walk as so much of it goes through lovely woodland, which is always my favourite. Less challenging on the elevation front, but still a few short steep inclines. 

Passes through some cute country villages until bringing you down to follow the river Mells all the way to Frome, which is a beautiful small town with plenty of food options. We had a well-earned meal at the Archangel with of
course, the obligatory Somerset pint of cider. 

Overall: 

Would recommend this walk for anyone looking to explore some of the prettiest parts of Somerset. Not too challenging and could potentially be split into shorter sections if needed. Very quiet, fairly well sign posted (though I’d still say have a map handy) with a nice variety of terrain and things to see.

Hope this is helpful, let me know if you have any questions 😊

Due to scheduling issues and breakthrough ovulation despite the combination birth control pill, I started stims much later in March 2025. 
I had the short antagonist protocol on the highest doses of gonal-f and menopur and eventually ganirelix. I had 7 days of stims total and day 8 was just ganirelix and gonal-f with an HCG trigger (not sure why I didn't  get a dual trigger protocol with HCG and lurpon). Day 8 ultrasound showed 6 follicles on the left at 18.2, 19.8, 20.3, 17.9, 17, and 11.2 mm and 2 follicles on the right at 21 and 10.8 mm. My estradiol was 1605 pg/ml. 

Went in with 7 decent sized follicles and got 7 total eggs but only 1 was mature. 
The low mature egg yield was surprising to me and the doc who did the retrieval. Seems like based on the last ultrasound I was ready to trigger. I'll try for another cycle and we discussed maybe a long lupron protocol in April.

I don't know what I can do myself to get a better outcome. 
I was taking an omega 3, prenatal with vitamin D, myo-inosital and d-chiro inositol, and CoQ10 (300mg) everyday for 3 months. I could increase the CoQ10 to 600mg. I drink way too much coffee (3-4 cups) so I'll cut it out completely.

I wonder too if maybe I have silent endometriosis, since I've had vague worsening PMS symptoms for the past few years but never really had very painful cramps. I don't think I want to go down the rabbit hole of trying to diagnose it right now since I dont think it'll change anything and my quality of life is not bad enough that I would want surgery.

Anyone else with a similar experience with low mature egg yield despite decent baseline labwork? Or any tips on what I can do next cycle to up my chances of a better outcome?
I may not be able to do a 3rd cycle because of time/work/financial constraints. So I really want to make the best of this new cycle.

Maybe because I never thought I’d get here. Maybe because someone out there needs to hear it. But if you’re struggling with social anxiety, read this till the end.

I was that guy. The one who panicked at the thought of raising his hand in class. The one who rehearsed saying “thank you” to the cashier but still messed it up. The one who turned down party invites, not because I didn’t want to go, but because I was terrified of what I’d say—or worse—what I wouldn’t say.

It wasn’t just shyness. It was crippling.

People used to joke, “Why are you so quiet?” They had no idea that inside, my heart was racing like I was about to face a firing squad. I thought, Maybe I’m just broken. Maybe I’ll never be normal.

And then came the worst moment of my life.

I was at a family wedding. My mom forced me to go. I sat in the corner, gripping my drink like it was a life raft. Then it happened. My uncle—who I hadn’t seen in years—called my name.

“Come here! Meet everyone!”

Everyone. At once. Looking at me.

I walked over like I was heading to my execution. My legs felt stiff, my mouth dry. Then, the nightmare:

Someone said, “You’re so awkward.”

Everyone laughed. I did too, pretending it didn’t cut me in half.

That night, I locked myself in my room and did something I hadn’t done in years. I cried. I wasn’t even sad—I was furious. At myself. At the world. At my stupid brain for making something as simple as talking feel like climbing Everest.

And then I found it.

Scrolling Reddit, I saw a post about something called ""The Process.""

I don’t know who created it. Some people say it was developed by psychologists. Others say it was just some guy who figured it out and shared it online. But it wasn’t like the “just be confident, bro” advice I hated. It was a system. A way to rewire my brain step by step.

I told myself: One last try. If this doesn’t work, I accept my fate.

The first challenge? Order coffee and say one extra sentence to the barista.

I nearly bailed. But then I thought about that wedding. About the life I’d have if I didn’t change. And I did it. I stuttered. I turned red. But I did it.

Then came the real battle.

Week after week, the challenges got harder.

Compliment a stranger.

Walk into a room like you belong there.

Hold eye contact for 3 seconds longer than you’re comfortable with.


Some days, I wanted to quit. But every time I completed a challenge, it felt like I was breaking chains I never knew I had.

And then, it happened.

A month later, I was at another event. A small get-together. Someone asked me a question.

And I answered.

Not in a whisper. Not looking at the floor. Like a normal f*cking person.

That night, I sat in my car and just exhaled. Because for the first time in my life, I wasn’t drowning.

I wasn’t “fixed.” I still had awkward moments. But for the first time, I realized: It wasn’t about being fearless. It was about showing up, even when I was scared.

Today, I have friends who actually know me, not just the anxious shell of me. I go out. I speak up. And if you’re where I was? Listen to me:

You are not broken. You are not doomed. You are just untrained.

And The Process? It’s out there. Find it. Try it.

We were happy as a family. Both of us work from home—sometimes struggling, sometimes thriving. In 2023, I had two full-time jobs because he was forced to close his business due to financial losses. I had to step up, but it wasn’t a big deal for me because I was always taught to stand on my own.

I supported him in pursuing his passions—streaming, video editing, trading, etc.—and even paid for his online course when he wanted to become a VA. Unfortunately, he didn’t succeed due to a lack of corporate experience, which some clients required. Through his lows, I supported him, picked him up, and showered him with love—so much that I forgot about myself.

Fast forward to recently, I randomly used his computer because I was too lazy to open mine for a quick HR task. While clearing the browser history (since I know how obsessive he is about his computer), I noticed a suspicious ""Instagram login."" It stood out because he had a new phone for a month now. I opened the email and saw a different IG account I had never seen before.

I hesitated to open it right away, worried it might notify his phone. Later, while we were having coffee, I casually asked to borrow his phone, which he handed over without hesitation. I checked Instagram, but the account I saw on his PC wasn’t there—making it even more suspicious.

I tried to brush it off, convincing myself it was nothing serious. After all, he had promised before that he would change, and I told myself I just needed to trust him. But my gut wouldn’t let it go. I borrowed his phone again and opened Instagram on his PC.

I saw everything I had prayed I’d never see. He had been messaging multiple women for one-night stands and inquiring about ""spa"" services with specific masseuses—from early 2023 until December 2024. All during the times I thought we were happy.

When I confronted him, he manipulated me—blaming me for everything. He said I never supported or appreciated him, making it seem like it was all my fault. At first, he wasn’t even apologetic; he only said sorry when I broke down in tears.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so tired of being manipulated, so tired of giving everything just to satisfy him and his ego.",26,1742899751.0,OffMyChestPH,6,1.0,False

He estimates that he has about 50% of the feeling he used to have. As an example, I think he means that it would take double the force of pricking him with a needle before he would feel it.

Other than this problem, he is (quite fortunately) relatively healthy -- he exercises regularly (multiple times weekly, less since this condition), and has a very healthy diet (primarily vegetable based, with plenty of fish/vegetables/protein, little sugar), and about 1 cup of 1 coffee and beer or wine daily.

He saw various doctors and finally got some MRIs which revealed a 4mm pituitary gland tumor, the doctor said it was probably benign because of the small size; also that it was not likely to be the cause of his symptoms.

My (100% layperson) googling of his conditions told me his numb limbs is called peripheral neuropathy, but obviously I'm no doctor and also I don't know to ask the right questions to do a proper diagnosis. If it really is peripheral neuropathy, google says it is not uncommon, with the likelihood of experiencing it increasing with age starting at age 50.

Anyhow, his doctors can't say anything conclusively so I'm hoping somebody out there is familiar with this condition can offer some assistance. I would appreciate any advice, and definitely let me know if there are more relevant/important questions I should be asking, or having him ask his doctor.

1jjggdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jjggdo/cant_choose_between_2_guys_advice_needed/,Can’t choose between 2 guys. Advice needed,"
I (21F) met this guy (24M) on hinge. Let’s call him A. And I met another guy (22M) on hinge too. Let’s call him B.

Normally I only date 1 guy at a time and don’t even talk to another guy when I’ve been on even 1 date with a guy. But my friend dates around until they’re exclusive or feels like she wants to see no one else. That doesn’t work for me coz It just feels weird to me. But I talked to both these guys and connected to both in a way.

So guy A and I went for a gym and food date one week then a snooker and dinner date the next week. I really enjoy his company and he’s sweet. He gives me my space but also lets me know he’s there. He checks in on me. Texts me everyday. Probably has high EQ coz he can tell when I’m upset. And all this I’ve noticed in just 2 weeks with just 2 dates. And I get the vibe and gut feeling that he’d make an excellent boyfriend. 

And guy B and I went for a coffee then bowling then dinner date a few days back. It was really fun. So many laughs. So much fun conversation. So many jokes. So many relatable talks. He was very sweet. And he’s CRAZY HOT! We texted after the date and decided we’ll stay in touch and meet this week. We haven’t texted since. That was a day ago. No big deal. I know he’ll text me within a few days. But now I can’t choose. 

Guy A makes me feel calm and no anxiety and stable. Liek sitting in front of a fireplace with hot coco. Guy B is like riding a fun roller coaster (not riding literally - keep your head out of the gutter). He makes me feel like really high and excited. 

The only scary thing is that I’ve Dated or liked guys that make me feel high like guy B before. Usually it’s a rollercoaster of emotions. And very emotionally taxing. I usually get really high when with them but Crash after. This happened after our first date with guy B but not guy A. 

Btw I’m bipolar and have attachment issues in the sense that I need consistent communication. Like just a check in text or a how’s your day text. I want to feel like I matter in your life. Not much to ask for. 

Now I knwo guy A is the better option but for some reason I don’t wanna let go of guy 2. My problem is that I want both of them. Selfish I knwo. I’m trying to work on that. I would easily cut off guy A for guy B but I don’t wanna lose a nice sweet understanding guy. That means cutting off guy B then. But I dont want to cut off a hot guy that I could potentially have a future with unless I’m very sure that it’ll work with guy A. 

I guess I just don’t want to give up guy B coz he’s like my ideal guy. Liek ethnicity and looks and stuff wise. But personality wise guy A is a better guy. Plus a scarcity mindset stops me from picking one. 

TLDR : met 2 great guys. One is really sweet and one is decently sweet but really hot. Like both of them. Can’t choose. ",0,1742899455.0,dating_advice,6,0.4,False

That’s what AI agents are all about!   
  
These clever digital helpers are popping up everywhere, making life easier and businesses smarter. Let’s explore what’s happening with AI agents today, with stats and stories that’ll make you say, “Wow, that’s cool!”—no tech degree required.

**What’s an AI Agent, Anyway?**

Think of AI agents as super-smart virtual assistants. Unlike basic tools that just do what you tell them, these agents can think, decide, and act on their own. Imagine Siri or Alexa, but upgraded—they might schedule your day, troubleshoot a problem, or even help a car drive itself (looking at you, Tesla). They’re like trusty helpers who don’t need a coffee break!

**Why Everyone’s Talking About Them**

* **Growing Like Crazy**: The market for AI agents is exploding! Experts at *Markets and Markets* say it’ll jump from $5.1 billion in 2024 to $47.1 billion by 2030. That’s like a lemonade stand turning into a global chain in six years!
* **Businesses Are Hooked**: *Deloitte Insights* predicts that by 2025, one in four companies using AI will test these agents, and by 2027, half will rely on them. It’s like watching a hot new trend sweep the world.
* **Top Trend Alert**: *Gartner* named AI agents the #1 tech trend for 2025. They’re calling it a total game-changer!

**Real-Life Magic with AI Agents**

These helpers are already making waves—here’s how:

* **Speedy Support**: At Wiley, a learning company, AI agents cut customer problem-solving time by 40%. That’s like halving your wait when you’re on hold! (*SalesForce*)
* **Shopping Made Simple**: Saks, the fancy retailer, uses AI agents for basic questions, letting their team wow customers with personal touches.
* **Fast Checkouts**: Kroger, the grocery giant, slashed checkout times by 50% with AI. Say goodbye to long lines!

# What’s Next for AI Agents?

* **Big Savings**: *Gartner* says that by 2026, AI agents will save contact centers $80 billion in labor costs. That’s more money for better service!
* **Taking Charge**: By 2028, these agents will handle 15% of daily work decisions on their own—up from zero today. It’s like having a coworker who nails the small stuff.
* **Custom Fit**: *Accenture* is creating AI agents for specific industries like telecom and finance, so every business can join the party.

**Okay, What’s the Catch?**

There are a couple of hurdles:

* **Keeping Things Safe**: Companies need to make sure our info stays private—nobody wants their secrets spilled!
* **Learning Curve**: Not everyone’s a tech pro, so businesses are helping their teams get comfy with these tools. It’s like figuring out a new gadget—takes a little time.

But here’s the good news: a *CIO Dive* survey found 85% of IT leaders trust AI agents to do tasks as well as—or better than—humans. That’s a huge thumbs-up!

**Why This Matters to You**

AI agents are here to make life smoother and work more fun. Whether it’s faster help on a customer service call or a virtual buddy managing your to-do list, they’re becoming part of our world. With the market set to grow nearly ten times bigger by 2030, they’re not going anywhere. It’s an exciting ride, and we’re just getting started—so get ready for your own AI sidekick to save the day!

Hi everyone. 

Mid December i decided to quit weed, a week later i decided to quit alcohol and caffeine too. I almost immediately noticed a loss of interest towards my hobbies. 



Ever since then it’s been a living hell. Up until February i was having bad panic attacks, i worked on those with a therapist and i’m now doing much better under that aspect. 



What hasn’t changed, and has worsened honestly, is the complete disinterest i have developed for all of my hobbies and life in general. The most i do is go to work, force myself to go work out, and sit on the couch with my gf, then go to sleep. 



I have lost all interest in editing photos, in taking photos, in posting them, in going to events where i can take them. I lost all interest in going out with my friends and acquaintances. I just feel so empty and unmotivated. I believed it was winter doing its thing, but the seasons are changing and my situation is mostly the same. I have even lost interest in sex. I am eating the same two foods for every meal. I don’t even find enjoyment in playing on my pc anymore, i bought myself a brand new pc for Christmas and have used it a few hours at most. I spent more time setting it up and building it vs the time i actually used it. 



I am getting tired of living like this, but i just feel so unmotivated to do anything, i lost all my drive and i’m just waiting to be better, waiting for the physical pains to go away, waiting for my mind to stop being so on edge. 



I miss my old self and have no idea how to get it back. I miss driving for hours to go to events and take photos there, i miss the late nights with friends, i miss being able to just go to a restaurant on my own and enjoy myself, i miss going out with my girlfriend and living our lives. I miss the person i was a few months ago, i feel like i’m just a shell of my old self, as if i’m running on power saving mode. And it only makes everything worse.

1jjge3l,https://i.redd.it/lst8fkb5etqe1.png,"Took many years, but I found a skincare good for me","I had issues with my skin since aound 12 y.o. Was always told it is due to eating sweets, or hormones (which were fine all the time), or stress, or bad hygiene, or anything else that required doctors to not do any proper check up. At the age of 25-26 I finally got a doctor who took time and told me I have rosacea and my journey started. A lot of trial and error, because I have breakouts and flareups easily (from coffee, hot/spicy food, embarrassing moments, transfer of embarrassment,  you name it).
Now, many years later, I found what works for me and I wanna share in case it helps.
 
1. I wash my face with La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+, or on good days, a gentle wash (from Garnier,  some yellow vit C facial wash). 
2. Toner (in the night Glycolic acid 7%, because you can't go on the sun with it; in the morning, some cucumber stoner I got in Miniso store, and surprisingly ha no reaction to).
3. Morning - hydrating cream (gel-like with aloe Vera, I use the one made for after sunburns) or cream mask ( Este Lauder Nutritions, or L'Oréal Revitalift). After the cream soaks in, I put Sunscreen SPF90, because I live in South America and sun here is not a joke.
4. Night - after wash and toner, I put night cream from L'Oréal (RevitaLift).

Now, if I have any breakouts, I put topically in the night a zinc paste (the one people use to dry the blisters during chicken pox, I think) or Soolantra cream if it is too serious. Sometimes Skinoren cream if I have it. Even the Hydrocortisone 1%.

For enlarged pores I use (after washing in the night), once per week, pore cleaning stripes on my nose, after which I put Differin adapaleno gel, to close the pores.

In 2025, the market for outdoor heating has exploded with innovative designs and functionalities, offering homeowners, landscapers, restaurant owners, and property managers an array of choices to enhance their outdoor spaces. Whether you're envisioning cozy nights spent roasting marshmallows with family, creating an inviting patio for your restaurant, or providing an upscale amenity for your apartment complex, this comprehensive buying guide will steer you toward the perfect fire pit to meet your specific needs and budget. We'll cover everything from different fuel types and materials to safety regulations and top-rated models. Let's dive in!

## Understanding Your Needs Before You Buy: Defining Your Ideal Outdoor Fire Pit

Before exploring the vast landscape of outdoor fire pits available, it's essential to pinpoint your individual or professional priorities. This crucial first step will ensure you make an informed decision and select a fire pit that perfectly aligns with your intended use,space limitations,and aesthetic preferences.

**For Homeowners:** Consider these factors:

*   **Available Space:** Do you have a sprawling backyard or a cozy patio? This will dictate the size and shape of your ideal fire pit. A large outdoor fire pit might overwhelm a small patio, while a small outdoor fire pit might be insufficient for a large gathering.
*   **Fuel Preference:** Wood-burning, gas, propane, or natural gas fire pit options each offer distinct advantages and disadvantages in terms of convenience, heat output, and environmental impact.
*   **Desired Aesthetic:** Do you prefer a rustic, modern, or customary style? Consider how the fire pit will complement your existing patio furniture and backyard design. A stone fire pit offers a natural, rustic feel, while a concrete fire pit provides a contemporary, minimalist aesthetic.
*   **Budget:** Outdoor fire pits range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. Determine your budget upfront to narrow down your options. Look for sales and deals offered by various retailers to maximize your purchasing power.*   **Features:** Do you want a fire pit with a grill for cooking, a spark screen for safety, or a cover to protect it from the elements? Fire pit accessories can greatly enhance the functionality and versatility of your outdoor fire pit.

**For Landscapers and Contractors:**

*   **Client Preferences:** Understanding your clients' vision for their outdoor space is paramount. Consider their desired style, budget, and intended use of the fire pit.
*   **Durability and Reliability:** Select fire pits that are built to withstand the rigors of outdoor use and are backed by a solid warranty. Steel fire pits and aluminum fire pits are known for their durability and resistance to rust.
*   **Installation Requirements:** Choose fire pits that are easy to install and maintain, minimizing labor costs and ensuring client satisfaction.
*   **Compliance with Local Regulations:** Ensure that the fire pits you install comply with all local fire pit regulations and safety codes.
*   **Wholesale Pricing and Bulk Discounts:** Partner with reputable suppliers that offer competitive pricing and discounts on bulk orders.

**For Restaurant and Hospitality Businesses:**

*   **Commercial-Grade Durability:** opt for fire pits specifically designed for commercial use, constructed from heavy-duty materials and built to withstand frequent use. Stainless steel fire pits are a popular choice for their durability and resistance to corrosion.*   **Safety Compliance:** Prioritize fire pits that meet all relevant safety standards and regulations for commercial establishments, including fire pit distance from house or other structures which may vary based on local ordinances.
*   **Aesthetic Cohesion:** Select fire pits that complement your restaurant's overall design aesthetic and create a welcoming and inviting atmosphere for patrons.
*   **Ease of Maintenance:** Choose fire pits that are easy to clean and maintain, minimizing downtime and ensuring a consistently attractive appearance.
*   **Fuel Efficiency:** Consider the fuel efficiency of different fire pit options to minimize operating costs. Natural gas fire pits are a cost-effective option for businesses with access to natural gas lines.

**For Property Managers:**

*   **Tenant Safety:** The safety of renters is a top priority. Low profile pits with secure guards are ideal.
*   **Maintenance costs:** Select materials such as stainless steal that require little to no cleaning.
*   **Easy Start and Shut Down:** If using a fuel source such as a wood burning fire pit, confirm proper training is available for employees and tenants before use. A gas fire pit offers instant flames for both start up and shut down.
*   **Longevity** Choosing a higher quality pit may prove to be more affordable in the long run.

## Exploring the Diverse World of Outdoor Fire Pits: Types,Materials,and Features

with your needs clearly defined,let's delve into the different types of outdoor fire pits available,exploring their unique characteristics and benefits.

**Fuel Types:**

*   **Wood-Burning Fire Pits:** Classic and authentic, wood-burning fire pits provide a traditional ambiance and crackling sound. However, they require a constant supply of firewood and produce smoke and ashes. They often require more cleaning and have strict fire pit regulations and safe fire pit practices to follow.

1jjg6yr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjg6yr,Best chocolate cake!,"Ingredients 
* 2 cups plain/all-purpose flour
* 1 cup light brown sugar
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup milk
* 1/2 cup veg oil or melted butter 
* 2 eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 cup strong hot coffee

Method:
1. Preheat oven to 350F or 180C. Grease & flour/cocoa powder two 9 inch round cake pans. In a large bowl combine flour, both sugars, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt. 
2. In another (large!)bowl add in milk, oil, eggs and vanilla until combined.
3. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients . Pour in the hot coffee (Batter will be thin)
4. Divide between the prepared pans and bake for 23-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

Tips:
- sometimes I use less batter and make a few cupcakes as well
- Half the mixture for smaller cakes as these make a very large and tall cake. 
- I use a buttercream icing as the cake itself is not too sweet!
- even better when warmed to serve!
