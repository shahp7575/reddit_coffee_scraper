1lel6ki,https://i.redd.it/pji5orf2np7f1.jpeg,Review: Found North Hell Diver 2025 17-Year Cask Strength Whisky,"Found North Hell Diver 2025 17-Year Cask Strength Whisky

Lottery opens: June 24, 2025
Lottery closes: June 26, 2025

Launches nationwide: June 27, 2025

Distilled in Canada 

Grain ratio: 86% corn, 13% rye, 1% barley 

High Altitude Series: blend, finish, reblend

The core blend was finished for an additional 6 months in PX Sherry, new American oak & Cognac casks 

Blend components:
20 year corn whisky 
24 year corn whisky 
17 year corn whisky
22 year rye 

NCF
No added coloring 

Proof: 112.4

Bottles produced: 6,228

MSRP: $169.99

Nose 👃: Pomegranate seeds. Almond extract. Devil’s food cake. Molasses. 

Palate 👅:  Tiramisu. Raspberry jam. White chocolate Macadamia nut cookies from Subway. Extremely dense mouthfeel.

Finish 🏁: White nectarine. German-roasted pecans. Dark roasted coffee.

Found North just doesn’t miss. I’m normally not one to love coffee notes in my whiskey, but this hits the spot for me. The coffee, nut, and fruit notes get it done. As always, if all Canadian whisky was this good… Americans wouldn’t bag on Canadian whisky.

1lel63l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lel63l,Black Forest Coffee table with matching end tables,"Three tables, one coffee and two end tables that I believe my German grandmother brought with her from Germany in about 1953 or '54. Information on the ground about their provenance was a little thin, but I could see them being from the 60's pretty easily, I just don't know when or how they'd have gotten to her. Familial connection wasn't super strong across the Atlantic for that side of the family. I can see the marks on the bottom and they look like batch numbers for the one (21/59) but the other I can't read. I also realize the second photo is a tiny bit blurry, but unfortunately so are my eyes, so I didn't notice at the time. Most likely seems they would have been made in '58 & '59 respectively, but I honestly don't know enough to comment any further, aside from saying they weren't still living in Germany at that time and I don't know how they'd have gotten to Tacoma, Washington. 

IN ANY CASE, ahem, I have these three tables that I've been holding onto for years at this point, but don't go with my decor at all anymore. Glass tops for all three, two original, one replacement (not pictured as they weigh a ton and don't add anything in particular). 

I've been reticent to sell these for some reasons of sentimentality (and also fear of losing a potentially valuable asset due to ignorance,) but I think I may finally be ready to let them go. Does anyone have any experience with selling vintage? And are they in fact vintage? I assume it's like any other sort of sales, where direct to buyer is the only way to realize the full value, but also you have to weed out a bunch of...people?

But before they go to a new home (possibly?) I thought I should share here since y'all really seem like the most likely group to actually be able to appreciate them and I think maybe I need that a little before they leave my house. Danke!",2,1750263161.0,VintageFurniture,0,1.0,False

1lel4tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerHardware/comments/1lel4tf/should_you_try_tunnelbear_vpn_in_2025_my_review/,Should You Try TunnelBear VPN in 2025? My Review After a Few Weeks,"I needed a VPN that was super easy to use, no complicated menus, no techy setup. A friend mentioned TunnelBear, mostly because of how simple and fun the app looks. The bear animations were kind of a gimmick, but honestly, it made the whole thing feel less intimidating. I downloaded it on my laptop and phone just to test it out and see if it could handle basic stuff like browsing safely on public WiFi and unlocking a few blocked sites.

The biggest pro is how beginner-friendly it is. You literally click a switch, and it connects. The app shows a map where the little bear ""tunnels"" to your chosen country. It’s clean, doesn’t overwhelm you with settings, and works well for basic privacy. I also like that they don’t bombard you with upsells all the time like some free VPNs do.

That said, the free plan only gives you 500MB of data a month, which is basically gone in a day if you stream or download anything. If you want to use it for things like Netflix or torrenting, it’s not ideal. Speeds are okay for casual browsing, but it’s not the fastest, especially on long-distance servers. And while it’s good for basic privacy, it doesn’t have as many advanced features as other VPNs like split tunneling or custom DNS settings.

If you're just looking for a no-stress way to stay a bit safer online while using hotel WiFi or coffee shop internet, TunnelBear works. But for anything heavier, you’ll probably hit its limits fast unless you upgrade to the paid plan and even then, there might be better options for the same price.",1,1750263076.0,ComputerHardware,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**  


Marlins pitcher Adam Mazar is making his first career start tonight – and the Phillies might be one of the toughest sets of training wheels out there. Even with Bryce Harper out and Nick Castellanos potentially still sitting (suspension), I think the Phillies will be eager to rectify yesterday’s loss and run up a high score on the newbie. To boot, Ranger Suarez (2.32 ERA) has been an Ace over the last month – he should have no issue keeping Miami in check. My money’s on Philly to put at least 5 in the bag here.

I want to meet you so badly.

Because I am tired.
Of chasing sleep only to dream of the way it felt to be in his arms so perfectly.
Of trying to forget the exact pressure of his kiss or the intensity of his eyes when he saw me. Really saw me.
Of waking up and realizing he is not mine anymore. I don’t belong to him either.

He still lingers in the corners of my mind —
a ghost wearing the face of someone I loved more than he asked me to.

But you… you are the proof that grief can and will loosen its grip.
That I can miss the way he touched me
and still no longer want him to come back.

I hope on the day we meet, I wake up and feel light.
Maybe stretch without checking my phone.
Maybe make my coffee and hum a song that has nothing to do with him.
Maybe look in the mirror and think “she’s so beautiful” again.

You are the day I will finally forgive myself for holding on too long in his absence.

This woman and I went to professional school together, we were friends during our first year, saw each other daily and were emeshed in each other's lives - as it is so easy to be in your early 20s in a university town. We drifted once our first year grades came out because our study habits weren't symbiotic. 

Now over a decade later we realized we live 5 mins away from each other and our both on maternity leave with our first babies. Our first meet up was great, chatted easily for over an hour, but I left with that guy sinking feeling that I overshared. 

Now we're getting together again and I just want to grow this friendship at a normal sustainable rate! I don't want to get too close too fast share too much and then have it fizzle out. I don't have any other mom friends really and the few that could be mom friends live to far to naturally form a friendship.

Any tips on how to be a human? Or you know just some commiseration will do.

Here’s how my experience has been so far.,"I have a Bipolar one diagnosis and am about eight months free of psych drugs. I have been hospitalized multiple times and went through extreme psychiatric trauma, neglect and abuse. Off psych medicine, I look and feel much healthier and my skin is glowing.  🧖‍♀️ My energy and sleep schedule are OK however I do struggle with insomnia. 💤 My mood feels the most stable it has ever been, I can think clearly, and I am pretty relieved to be disengaged from the mental health system. 

Occasionally I will have panic attacks about my trauma and have to use PRNs. 💊 I have a fear of ever being coerced into psychiatric treatment again. While tapering, I switched to naturopathic care which has been amazing and I am very grateful for my holistic providers. My diet has been good compared to when I was on psych drugs! I have been a vegetarian my whole life although I eat healthier now and make good salads or soups. I drink mango smoothies and drink coffee!! (psychiatrists have tried to make me stop drinking coffee. ☕️🙄) 

I spend my days immersed in nature, journaling and engaging in activities that bring me calmness, rather than feeling stuck in mental health clinics worrying about my symptoms. I'm learning to embrace my bipolar disorder and focus on the positive aspects of my life.🏞️ It feels so good to reclaim my autonomy and I also feel more aware of my moods. I ghosted the system for now. I don't want any more notes about me on my files. I want to just be left alone! 👻

Working is enjoyable for me. I like having a job and often visit cafes and libraries. I also go out for drinks with my friends. 🍸 Every day, I walk outside for at least an hour in the city parks. It’s beautiful, and the fresh air is very relaxing. During these journeys, I meet many new people. I am on the anti-psych Reddit page a lot and that is very supportive for me. My experiences are valid, and they matter. ❤️‍🩹

With a serious underlying health condition, I also am unable to take medicine. My body will not tolerate most of these drugs. Sometimes I do feel that my mood rapidly cycles a lot. The only medication I take right now is Propranolol 60mg ER, prescribed by my other specialists (not psychiatry) — and it’s been so helpful 💆‍♀️💗. It calms my heart rate and gets rid of my anxiety, without being overwhelming for my mind. I have severe trauma from being around hospitals and in my city, it feels almost foreign to restart my life without being involved with psychiatry. I often drive past hospitals and experience flashbacks or panic.🏥 I liked Laura Delano’s work a lot and could relate to it. My bipolar is for me and I am in control. I do things that I believe are best for my health.

And because of that… I feel peaceful. Blissful. Confident. Happy. Free!!! 🌿💫💖☺️",2,1750262644.0,FreeBipolar,0,1.0,False

It really looks like covering for her these past few days has totally worn me out.

Whether it’s a regular meetup, design workshops, portfolio reviews or even a casual coffee chat, I’d love to be apart of some space where I can learn from others. 

If anyone knows any groups or has suggestions on where to find them in Chicago, that would be great!

It was a cutting that they propagated and repotted. And when I received it it was a little smaller than this. I have googled what it is and Google says it's a Heart Philodendron, so I looked up care instructions and have been trying to keep the watering to a minimum and it is placed in my room which has one north facing window which I try to keep the blind up on most of the day.

I think my flat is quite a dry environment, so am going to look for a spritzer or a larger tray to fill with rocks and put water in to try and throw some humidity into the area.

When I received it the pot was only about two thirds full, so I left it to settle and then about three weeks ago I topped it up with a mix of houseplant compost and coffee grounds.

Chapter 1  
  
The day I got my marriage license with Reed Hawthorne, he told me:  
  
""We'll only have the title of husband and wife, nothing real between us.  
  
""As long as you behave and play the good Mrs. Hawthorne, I can give you anything you want—except me.""  
  
I was obedient. I played the perfect Mrs. Hawthorne for three whole years.  
  
Three years later, his first love, Vivian Cross, suddenly appeared and handed me ten million dollars and told me to leave Reed.  
  
""Reed says you two are just victims of the previous generation's mess. Your marriage has always been in name only.  
  
""He wants to have a real family now, with a child born from someone he actually loves.  
  
""You've already held him back for three years. I hope you can let him go.""  
  
So he had someone he liked now!  
  
It really wasn't right for me to keep occupying the position of Mrs. Hawthorne anymore.  
  
That night, I went to find Reed in his study.  
  
""Back then you said I could have whatever I wanted. Does that still count?""  
  
Reed put down the documents in his hands, his slender fingers removing the glasses from his nose.  
  
His eyes flickered, a smile playing at his lips.  
  
""Of course.  
  
""What do you want?""  
  
My hand holding the documents tightened slightly as I placed the divorce papers in front of him.  
  
""I want you to sign this.""  
  
\---  
  
Everyone said I hit the jackpot when I married Reed Hawthorne—like I'd won the damn lottery becoming Mrs. Hawthorne.  
  
But they had no clue. This marriage? Neither of us wanted it.  
  
It all started when Grandpa got really sick and had to be hospitalized.  
  
Reed's grandfather happened to be in the same place, and by pure chance, Mr. Hawthorne recognized Grandpa as an old war buddy.  
  
The kind who'd saved his life, no less.  
  
The two old guys spent hours reminiscing about the past, catching up on everything.  
  
When they got to talking about me, Grandpa's voice cracked.  
  
He was terrified that after he was gone, my stepmother and her kids would make my life hell.  
  
Mr. Hawthorne couldn't stand seeing his old friend so torn up. Right then and there, he said I should marry his grandson.  
  
So that's how Reed and I met—on day one.  
  
Day two, we found out about this arranged marriage that came out of nowhere.  
  
Day three, we were husband and wife.  
  
Right after we got our marriage license, Reed laid it out for me.  
  
""We'll only have the title of husband and wife, nothing real between us.  
  
""As long as you behave and play the good Mrs. Hawthorne, I can give you anything you want—except me.""  
  
Honestly? I was relieved when he said that.  
  
I mean, some guy I'd known for three days suddenly becoming my husband?  
  
Truth is, I couldn't wrap my head around it either.  
  
So we settled into this weird roommate situation with wedding rings.  
  
At first, I felt pretty awkward about the whole thing.  
  
But Reed? He was actually amazing.  
  
On the daily, I got nannies and housekeepers handling everything.  
  
Money-wise, he used to drop five million into my account every month, and he'd even given me his extra card.  
  
Relationship-wise, he actually acted like the married man he was supposed to be.  
  
I never saw a single tabloid story about him with other women.  
  
Even though hardly anyone knew he was married, and absolutely nobody knew I existed.  
  
As time went on, I started really loving what we had.  
  
I thought we'd go on like this forever.  
  
But I forgot—he never loved me.  
  
So of course he wasn't going to let me be Mrs. Hawthorne forever.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Last night Reed didn't come home.  
  
I mean, sometimes he'd be gone on business trips and stuff.  
  
But this time felt different.  
  
There it was on the news—Reed gently helping Vivian along, and her looking all shy and smitten as she gazed up at him.  
  
In three years of marriage, this was the first time I'd ever seen any news about him with another woman.  
  
\[Hawthorne Group CEO and Emmy-Winning Actress Vivian Cross Spotted on Late-Night Malibu Beach Walk.\]  
  
The comments section was going crazy.  
  
Most people were saying how perfect they looked together, what a power couple they'd make.  
  
My fingers unconsciously traced over Reed's face in the photo—how relaxed he looked, how genuinely happy.  
  
My chest tightened.  
  
Yeah, they really did look perfect together.  
  
The next morning, I saw Reed.  
  
I had no idea when he'd gotten back.  
  
Not that he needed to tell me anyway.  
  
""Have you been keeping up with the news lately?""  
  
Reed's smooth voice cut through the quiet, and I stopped mid-spoon, looking up at him.  
  
""What news?""  
  
Something flickered in his eyes. He studied me for a long moment before saying casually, ""Nothing important.  
  
""Just some trashy gossip.""  
  
I kept my voice even. ""Okay.""  
  
Then went back to my cereal.  
  
After a beat, he spoke again.  
  
""Probably better that you didn't see it anyway."" His voice was low, and I couldn't tell if he sounded relieved or disappointed.  
  
My heart clenched.  
  
I figured he was probably hoping for a different answer from me.  
  
That way he could've kept the conversation going.  
  
And then dumped me.  
  
I thought if I just kept dodging the truth, maybe I could stay by Reed's side a little longer.  
  
But here's the thing about stuff that was never yours to begin  
  
—no matter how badly you want to hold onto it.  
  
Eventually, you're just fooling yourself.  
  
""Thanks for agreeing to meet with me today.""  
  
Sitting across from me was Hollywood's hottest leading lady, Vivian Cross.  
  
When the housekeeper told me Vivian wanted to see me, my first instinct was to say hell no.  
  
But if it wasn't today, it'd be tomorrow.  
  
I could dodge her once, maybe twice, but how long could that last?  
  
""What did you want to talk about?"" I asked, even though we both knew why she was here.  
  
Vivian picked up her coffee and took a delicate sip, every movement graceful, her smile picture-perfect.  
  
There was no contest between us.  
  
""Reed and I went to college together,"" she said with a soft smile. ""He never told you that, did he?""  
  
My stomach dropped, but I nodded.  
  
""No, he didn't mention it.""  
  
""But Reed's told me all about you."" Her tone shifted slightly. ""You're the wife his grandfather forced him to marry three years ago, right?""  
  
Forced.  
  
So, that's how Reed had explained me to her.  
  
I mean, he wasn't wrong, but it still felt like a punch to the gut.  
  
""Yeah, that's right."" My voice came out flat, emotionless, as I gripped my coffee cup tighter, willing my hands not to shake.  
  
She smiled that calm, confident smile and pulled a check from her purse, sliding it across the table.  
  
""That's ten million. I want you to leave Reed.""  
  
Her smile was so sure, so composed—and it made me want to throw up.  
  
""Did he ask you to come here?"" The words came out like gravel.  
  
Vivian shook her head, her voice flowing like silk.  
  
""Reed told me you two are just casualties of some old family debt, that your marriage has never been real.  
  
""He wants to have a real family now. With someone he actually loves, and kids of his own.  
  
""You've already taken three years from him. I think it's time you let him go.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I didn't take Vivian's money.  
  
I'd already been sitting in someone else's rightful place as Mrs. Hawthorne for all these years—taking her money on top of that?  
  
That just felt wrong on every level.  
  
My grandfather passed away a year ago.  
  
Back then, I thought Reed would divorce me right away.  
  
But he didn't.  
  
He was the one who handled all the funeral arrangements after Grandpa died.  
  
My dad and stepmom's family? They were nowhere to be found from start to finish.  
  
Ever since they found out Grandpa needed surgery and it was going to cost a fortune, they just vanished into thin air.  
  
The only reason I agreed to marry Reed in the first place was because his grandfather promised he'd cover my grandpa's medical bills.  
  
During that time, Reed stayed with me for two whole weeks.  
  
When I'd break down crying under the covers in the middle of the night, he'd hold me tight and just wait in silence until I cried myself to sleep before he'd leave.  
  
When I had no appetite for anything, he'd personally go out and buy me those chocolate chip cookies from Levain Bakery that Grandpa used to get for me.  
  
And when I felt completely alone in the world, he brought me a dog so I'd have company again.  
  
I'd already fallen in love with him.  
  
But the person he loved wasn't me.  
  
Someone that wonderful—how could I be selfish enough to stand in the way of his happiness?  
  
That evening, I went to find Reed in his study.  
  
Sitting behind his desk, Reed looked even more untouchable than usual.  
  
I slowly walked over to face him, and after steeling myself, I spoke up.  
  
""Remember when you said I could have anything I wanted? Does that still stand?""  
  
Reed set down the papers he was holding, those long fingers of his removing the glasses from his nose.  
  
His eyes flickered with something, a smile playing at the corners of his mouth.  
  
""Of course.  
  
""What is it you want?""  
  
That look in his eyes—like he'd been waiting for this moment forever.  
  
So he'd been wanting to divorce me all along!  
  
My grip tightened on the papers in my hand, then I placed the divorce agreement in front of him.  
  
""I want you to sign this.""  
  
As the document hit the desk, it felt like someone had grabbed my heart in a vice grip—the pain was so sharp I could barely breathe.  
  
My eyes burned hot, and before the tears could completely betray me, I rushed to finish what I had to say.  
  
""I already signed it.  
  
""Once you sign, we can go file for divorce tomorrow.""  
  
With that, I spun around and bolted from the study.  
  
The tears started falling like rain the second I turned away.  
  
Back in my room, I buried myself under the covers and sobbed.  
  
This was only the second time in my life I'd cried this hard.  
  
Turns out love really does hurt.  
  
It hurt until my eyes were swollen, until my whole body ached, like it wasn't even mine anymore.  
  
I didn't sleep a wink, and by morning my eyes were puffy and red.  
  
Looking at my wrecked reflection in the mirror, I sniffled and told myself I absolutely could not let Reed see that I'd been crying.  
  
After several layers of concealer, once I was sure my face showed no trace of tears.  
  
Finally, I dragged myself out of the room.

I drink a small coffee when i wake up, then another around 9 when i arrive at my desk. Usually some more around noon. Id rather not drink more coffee. Also, i definitely dont get enough sleep (6-7 hours), but living with roommates its impossible to go to bed earlier than 11, let alone fall asleep then.

Chapter 1  
  
SAVANNAH  
  
""Seriously? You're worked up about him shaving?"" my best friend Riley let out an exasperated laugh. ""Since when is that a crime?""  
  
""He never shaves at night,"" I said quietly.  
  
""Oh come on, maybe he had a dinner meeting!""  
  
I shook my head firmly.  
  
""Riley, you know Edward. Home by seven, lights out by eleven - the man runs like clockwork. He hasn't done a business dinner in years.""  
  
""Right, because he's too busy being madly in love with you,"" Riley countered, her expression softening. ""Savannah, please tell me you're not actually worried about this?""  
  
I caught myself and managed a small laugh.  
  
""Of course not.""  
  
As if on cue, my phone lit up with Edward's call.  
  
""Sweetheart, Jenny mentioned you hardly touched your lunch. I've had Mark pick up some of your favorites from Bella's Kitchen. Get some food in you, take a little walk before your nap - and hey, I grabbed us tickets to that new Broadway show you've been wanting to see.""  
  
His voice carried that gentle warmth he reserved just for me, like someone speaking to their most precious person in the world.  
  
Riley was listening in, shaking her head in disbelief.  
  
""God, if anyone at New Star Media could hear their ice-cold CEO right now...""  
  
I couldn't blame her amazement. The Edward Reed that everyone else knew was all sharp suits and sharper decisions, the ruthless Wall Street legend who'd built an empire before forty. Sure, people knew he was devoted to his wife - but they had no idea just how deep that devotion ran.  
  
We'd been together for ten years, married for five, and this tender, attentive version of Edward had always been mine alone. He could recite my coffee order in his sleep, knew exactly which designer's new collection would catch my eye, could tell from a single text if I was having a rough day...  
  
Last summer, I stormed out after a fight about his overprotective streak. Spent the night at The Plaza. When I came home the next morning, I found him on our living room couch, still in yesterday's suit, looking like he'd aged years overnight. The moment he saw me, he crossed the room in three strides and pulled me close, his voice breaking: ""I'm so sorry, baby. Never again.""  
  
Then there was that weekend at the Hamptons last year. Our vacation villa caught fire while he was out grabbing my favorite ice cream. He tried to charge into the burning building - it took three security guards and the local firefighters to hold him back. Only when he heard me screaming his name from the pool house did he stop fighting them, his designer suit singed and smoking.  
  
He still has a scar above his eyebrow from that night. Every time I see it, my heart twists, but he just gives me that soft smile and says, ""My battle scar from being Savi's hero.""  
  
That's the thing about Edward's love for me. It's my constant, my true north - more reliable than gravity itself.  
  
And God knows I love him just as fiercely.  
  
Which is exactly why something as small as him shaving before bed...  
  
I noticed it instantly.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
SAVANNAH  
  
They say Cancers are born worriers. Mix that with my mom's perfectionist DNA, and you've got someone who sees a red flag in every tiny change to routine.  
  
Normally when a guy shaves at night, he's heading to a business dinner. But Edward? He's got his routine down to a science - dinner at one of his regular spots, then straight home. No cocktail hours, no networking events, nothing.  
  
So what could possibly make Manhattan's most powerful CEO break his golden rule? Was there some crisis at New Star Media he was shielding me from?  
  
I had to see for myself. If everything was fine, great. If not, we'd face it together.  
  
I called Sarah. We'd been roommates all through NYU, and now she was CFO at New Star Media. Back when her family lost everything in the 2008 crash, I'd helped her get back on her feet and convinced Edward to give her a shot at the firm.  
  
She practically sprinted across the marble lobby when she saw me.  
  
""Savannah!"" She pulled me into a hug before whisking me toward the private elevator. ""You need to visit more often! The whole office lights up when you're here. Even Edward's death glare takes a vacation.""  
  
I couldn't help but smile. ""Everything okay around here lately?""  
  
""Better than okay - huge news!""  
  
""What?"" My stomach dropped.  
  
""We doubled our profits! Everyone's getting massive bonuses!"" Sarah's whole face lit up. That's what I've always loved about her - life knocked her down hard, but she never lost that sparkle.  
  
Edward was stuck in meetings, so Sarah walked me to his corner office. As we passed the executive floor, I noticed a cluster of unfamiliar faces - all young, female, and looking like they'd stepped off a magazine cover.  
  
A nasty little thought crept in: Was this why he'd suddenly started caring about evening grooming?  
  
I immediately felt sick at myself. This was Edward Reed, for God's sake. The same man who'd hosted the Miss Manhattan pageant at our venue and spent the whole evening answering work emails in his office.  
  
""You okay? You've got that look,"" Sarah nudged me.  
  
I bit my lip. ""New assistants?""  
  
""What? Oh - the PR team. Business is booming, so Edward set up a dedicated external relations department. His idea, actually - said it was the only way to keep his promise about being home for dinner every night.""  
  
She gave me that knowing look. ""Savannah, you were literally on Vanity Fair's '30 Under 30' list. Are you seriously worried about the PR girls?""  
  
""I know, I know, I'm being ridiculous,"" I laughed weakly.  
  
Sarah squeezed my arm. ""Your overthinking is going to give you premature wrinkles. Relax - they handle client events. Edward barely knows their names.""  
  
After she left, I sank into Edward's chair, staring at the gallery of our photos on his desk. Photos from our vineyard wedding, our Amalfi Coast anniversary, casual shots of me laughing in Central Park...  
  
So the company was thriving. No other woman. Maybe he just got a fancy new electric razor from his Birchbox. Maybe he just felt like it.  
  
Riley and Sarah kept telling me if I hadn't married someone as steady as Edward, my anxiety would've landed me in therapy years ago.  
  
Then came a soft knock.  
  
A woman entered, head slightly bowed, setting down a cup of artisan tea with picture-perfect precision.  
  
""Mrs. Reed, please don't hesitate if you need anything else.""  
  
My blood ran cold.  
  
Claire Morrison. Edward's executive assistant.  
  
I hadn't expected to see her.  
  
She was still here.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
SAVANNAH  
  
A few years ago, Edward came home looking like he'd seen a ghost. I knew something was wrong the moment he walked through our apartment door.  
  
He sat on our Italian leather sofa for what felt like hours before he finally spoke. He'd run into the family of the drunk driver who killed his parents.  
  
The accident happened when Edward was at NYU. His parents were stopped at a red light on the Mass Pike when a drunk driver plowed into them at full speed. All three died instantly.  
  
Claire Morrison was that driver's daughter.  
  
Edward had discovered this three months after his HR team hired her as his executive assistant.  
  
I'd never seen him so shaken - his hands trembling, eyes bloodshot. ""Savi, I can't... every time I see her, all I can think about is that night. Sometimes I just want to..."" His voice cracked. This was Edward Reed - the man who could make or break companies without blinking - completely undone.  
  
I pulled him close, running my fingers through his hair. ""Hey, it's okay. You don't have to handle this alone. You can have HR transfer her, give her a great recommendation.""  
  
That was the first time I'd ever seen the ruthless CEO of New Star Media break down like a lost child, holding onto me like I was his anchor to reality.  
  
When I carefully broached the subject a few weeks later, he seemed back to his usual composed self.  
  
""I had her moved to Operations on a different floor.""  
  
""Why keep her at all? Are you sure you're okay with this?""  
  
His expression was surprisingly peaceful. ""You were right - I can't let the past control me forever. Maybe this is my chance to grow beyond it. I'm fine, really.""  
  
After that, during my occasional office visits, Claire vanished from sight. Edward never mentioned her again. I thought he'd finally found his peace with it.  
  
Until today, when she walked into his corner office.  
  
""I recall Melissa was Edward's assistant?""  
  
Claire gave that nervous smile she'd perfected. ""She's on maternity leave. A few of us from Operations are rotating coverage.""  
  
""That must be quite the adjustment,"" I said diplomatically.  
  
Claire wasn't exactly Manhattan executive material. Small-boned, almost delicate, with plain features and off-the-rack clothes. She had this permanent deer-in-headlights look - like someone who spent their life trying not to be noticed.  
  
She dipped her head slightly. ""Mrs. Reed, I should get back to the front desk.""  
  
As she turned, I caught sight of something on her neck - several distinctive red marks.  
  
Unmistakably hickeys.  
  
Edward returned from his board meeting looking every inch the power player in his bespoke Tom Ford suit.  
  
He leaned against the doorframe of his office, just watching me with that smile that still made my heart skip. ""Finally decided to grace New Star Media with your presence?""  
  
I walked over and slipped into his arms. ""Maybe I should visit more often. Your entire staff lights up when I'm here.""  
  
He tweaked my nose playfully. ""They better not light up too much.""  
  
I chose my next words carefully. ""Claire brought me coffee earlier.""  
  
He stilled for a moment before managing a quiet ""Mm.""

I am a chocoholic and I eat at least a quarter of a bar of pure chocolate(milk chocolate) with some almonds everyday. Apart from that I avoid alcohol and coffee, excessive salt , chips ,any carbonated drinks and have been avoiding them for 20 years . So my diet is basically as follows :

**Breakfast : One slice of white bread (plain white bread gobbled with plain water)**

**Lunch : Two slices of chicken sandwich (the ones with a bit of mayo, its called chicken salad in bread)**

**Tea time : A glass of hot chocolate milk**

**Dinner : Brown rice and 2 chicken thighs and vegetables and an apple**

**Post Dinner : Milk chocolate the size of 4 fingers**

My Height is 168 cm and my weight is 84 or 85 kg. My BMI is 29.8 .

I go to the gym 3- 4 times a week and do mostly strength training. My steps on the average per day is around 6000 , as I am working.

For avid gym goers and buff guys , what are your thoughts on my stats above ? What could be the reason I am not getting buff and losing as much weight as I want fast ?",0,1750262098.0,MaleSurvivingSpace,10,0.29,False

1lekitp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveAtFirstSight/comments/1lekitp/a_lady_in_rain/,A Lady in Rain,"It was not a rainy season but Chennai welcoming its surprising guest before the sun set. The chill breeze carries all the memories of my childhood days. After got down from a bus I am still wondering what made me stand on that road under that tree! It might be the fast falling rain drops or her. Yes, it was her that funny looking young lady in blue t-shirt with perfectly fitted jeans, standing there under a big tree which bearing beautiful flowers. I have never seen her before, she wasn’t an extraordinary but exceptional. Her playful eyes twinkling with each drops of rain drop it catches on its gaze. Her dancing gestures moving along with the sound of rain water hitting the ground. It wasn’t just the two of us standing under the tree but some school kids and their parents too sheltered under that tree. What caught my attention towards her was her kind and friendly act of holding her umbrella above a little girl despite of her, being drenched. I know I am getting late to go but something was telling me to go and talk to her. It was not a common thing here that, you can directly approach and talk to any random girl. However, I didn’t want to go at least appreciating her kindness.
I said “hi” and I was shocked to hear my own voice and guts.
She responded with a questioning smile “yes”.
She responded to me my inner-boy dancing and summersaulting, this wasn’t a dream even if so god I didn’t want that to end at any cost. She was looking at my stupid face with enquiry look, her perfectly curved brows was telling me “I bet you, you would never see anything like me before”. It was so hard for me to focus while her face express lots of things on one go. I wanted to run away from there I didn’t want her to take me as some flirt or jerks loitering on the road to hit a beautiful girl on their way to somewhere. So I asked her this, “Ma’am could you guide me towards the nearly IT Park, I have an interview there.” I couldn’t say it was a relief or she saw my idiotic face, she was smiling wide. She told me that I have to go straight then take left, after gave the direction she was looking at me like scanning, then only I noticed that all the way I was drenched like a chick even though I had umbrella in my hand but unopened all the while I was standing under the rain and observing her. I supposed to admit that she must have cast a spell over me that I have never felt like this much mesmerized after seeing someone. Her brow slightly raised above, I confessed the truth that I was observing her from the very moment of we hopped down from a same bus and her gesture of kindness and all. Even that wasn’t my type, out of all the fear I confessed that she was amazing. She listened all my stupid confession patiently, but she started to give away the sign of irritation when I asked her for a coffee. She asked me “aren’t you late to the interview?” I wasn’t just a question but a sign that she caught me red-handed there was no way of keep going with the lie so I told her, “sorry I am not here for an interview but I am an employee of that company, after seeing you I don’t know what happened to me but, I am sure I don’t want to miss you. Coffee, please?” She just turned away from me and started to walk after few steps she turned towards me, a beautiful smile appeared on her face. I walked towards her each step weighed me tons tied on my leg. I was nervous as I was about to hear my board exam result. She said “is this how you always do whenever you come across any female?” I was hurt, it was hurting like a piercing knife but, she was correct I supposed to be straight forward instead of being this much quire. What would be she thinking about me? When I was about to apologies, she smiled at me and said “I’m impressed”.",1,1750261646.0,LoveAtFirstSight,0,1.0,False

It’s already here. People are unplugging from cubicles, plugging into Wi-Fi, and hitting the road with nothing but a laptop and a lust for freedom. But here’s the kicker—just because you can roam, doesn’t mean you’re immune to the rules. Legality? It matters. It’s the difference between living the dream and waking up in a bureaucratic nightmare.

***🚀 Curious about your earning potential on the road? [Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in Under 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Defining the Digital Nomad**

What makes someone a digital nomad? Not just a traveler with a laptop. It’s a mindset. A refusal to be pinned down. Remote work, freelancing, entrepreneurship—these are your weapons. But don’t get it twisted: not all remote workers are nomads, and not all nomads are legal.

Remote work is when your boss lets you clock in from anywhere. Freelancing? You’re your own boss, juggling clients like a circus act. Entrepreneurship? You’re building empires from coffee shops. Each path, its own legal landmines.

***🌎 Ready to break free? [Check your digital nomad income potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**The US Legal Framework: A Labyrinth or a Playground?**

America. Land of the free, home of the paperwork. The legal framework is a labyrinth—twisting, turning, designed to trip up the unwary. Immigration status is your first hurdle. Are you a citizen, a green card holder, or just passing through? The answer changes everything.

Citizens and residents have the golden ticket. Visitors? You’re dancing on the edge. One wrong move, and you’re out.

**Visas: The Gatekeepers**

Tourist visas. The digital nomad’s favorite loophole—or is it? The B-1/B-2 visa is a gray zone. Technically, you’re not supposed to “work.” But what if your clients are overseas? The law shrugs. The ESTA and Visa Waiver Program? Even murkier. It’s legal limbo with a smile.

***💡 Want to know if your skills translate to nomad income? [Find out in 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Working While Traveling: The Legal Tightrope**

What counts as “work”? If you’re earning money, the law cares. If you’re taking a job from an American, the law cares even more. Digital work for foreign clients? Maybe you’re safe. Maybe you’re not. The line is thinner than a Wi-Fi signal in the Mojave.

Digital work is usually tolerated if you’re not dipping into the local job market. But local employment? That’s a fast track to deportation.

***✈️ Dreaming of a borderless income? [Unlock your nomad earning power!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Taxes: Uncle Sam Wants His Cut**

Think you can dodge taxes by hopping state lines? Think again. The IRS doesn’t care where you lay your head. If you’re a US citizen or resident, you owe taxes on worldwide income. State taxes? That’s a game of musical chairs. Self-employed? The paperwork multiplies like rabbits.

Residency rules are a spider’s web. Stay too long in one state, and you’re on the hook. Nomads shuffle states to dodge taxes, but the IRS is always watching.

**Business Registration: To LLC or Not to LLC?**

Running a business on the go? You’ll need to register somewhere. Delaware and Wyoming are digital nomad darlings—low fees, minimal hassle. But don’t forget: your “home” state might want a piece of the action. Your couch could be your headquarters, but the law wants an address.

***🔥 Ready to monetize your wanderlust? [Test your digital nomad income potential!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Health Insurance: The Invisible Safety Net**

The Affordable Care Act lurks in the background. If you’re a citizen, you need coverage—or a good excuse. International health insurance is the nomad’s secret weapon. Don’t get caught without it. One accident, and you’re bankrupt before you hit “send” on your next invoice.

**Banking and Finances: The Modern-Day Outlaw’s Toolkit**

Opening a bank account without a fixed address? Tricky, but not impossible. Fintech companies are your allies. Traditional banks want proof you exist. Digital nomads become financial phantoms, slipping through the cracks.

***🌐 Wondering if your digital skills pay off? [Diagnose your nomad income now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Housing and Mail: The Art of Being Nowhere**

Legal address? Virtual mailboxes are the new frontier. But some states don’t play nice. You need an address for taxes, banking, and voting. The art is to be everywhere and nowhere at once.

**Internet and Privacy: The Surveillance State**

Staying connected is survival. But beware the surveillance state. Public Wi-Fi is a honeypot for hackers. VPNs are your digital cloak. Protect your data like it’s gold.

***💼 Want to know if your side hustle is nomad gold? [Find out instantly!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Zoning and Local Laws: The Hidden Traps**

Short-term rentals? Some cities hate them. Coworking spaces? Usually legal, but check the fine print. Local ordinances are landmines. Step wrong, and you’re out of the game.

**Driving and Transportation: Nomads on the Move**

Driver’s licenses expire. Vehicle registrations need a home base. Rideshares and rentals fill the gaps, but insurance is a minefield. Don’t get stranded by bureaucracy.

**Family and Dependents: Nomadism with Baggage**

Got kids? Schooling laws follow you. Homeschooling is legal—sometimes. Spouses and partners need their own visas. Family nomadism is a high-wire act.

**The Corporate Nomad: Employees on the Loose**

If you’re working for a company, their policies matter. US labor laws still apply. Remote work compliance is a moving target. Don’t assume your boss has your back.

**The Freelancer’s Dilemma: Contracts and Clients**

Contracts are your shield. Make them ironclad. Getting paid across borders is a dance with banks and tax authorities. Don’t let a loophole become a noose.

***🌎 Ready to break free? [Check your digital nomad income potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Risks and Penalties: The Price of Noncompliance**

Overstay your visa? The consequences are brutal. IRS audits? Nightmarish. The price of noncompliance is steep—fines, bans, even jail time.

**The Future of Digital Nomadism in the US**

Digital nomad visas are on the horizon. Lawmakers are waking up. The future? Brighter, but not here yet. Advocacy is your friend.

**Pro Tips for Staying Legal**

Keep records. Every contract, every invoice, every visa stamp. When in doubt, lawyer up. The law is a maze—don’t get lost.

**Conclusion: The Nomad’s Manifesto**

Freedom is intoxicating. But it comes with strings. The nomadic lifestyle in the US is legal—if you play by the rules. Dodge the pitfalls. Embrace the hustle. Blaze your own trail. The world is waiting, and so is your next adventure.",1,1750261472.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

There’s a guy—Isaiah. I’ve known him my whole life, in the way you “know” someone because your parents do. We played soccer as kids, and our families still run into each other at coffee shops or restaurants every now and then. Every time, I’d think he’s even more grounded than I remembered—and feel this quiet, inexplicable ache I couldn’t shake.

We were never close. He always felt just out of reach. And I’ve never been the girl guys naturally gravitate toward—I usually have to make the first move. So I accepted that he’d probably stay in that wistful, just-out-of-reach category.

But a couple years ago, we talked. He came up to me at a casual event—our first real one-on-one moment. He remembered my name, asked about my parents, brought up old mutual friends. He was warm, thoughtful, and so present. I didn’t realize how much it meant until I found myself replaying it weeks later, over and over.

Around that same time, my life was changing. I was healing from toxic friendships, close to finishing college, and quietly craving something more grounded. After prayer and reflection, I decided to start attending a new church. I had no idea—until I saw him again—that it was his church too. I thought that this could finally be my opportunity to effortlessly become apart of his social circle.


Now I see him almost every Sunday. I did go up to him once and talked to him—it was a really kind, easy moment. But since then, I’ve found myself hesitating. If he’s with friends or family I don’t know, I get nervous. I don’t want to come off too strong or make things awkward. It’s not that I’ve been ignored or rejected… more like I’ve quietly stepped back, unsure if it’s okay to step forward again.

The Sundays I see him sitting with his family in the same spot every week feel like breadcrumbs I keep holding onto, not because I’m delusional, but because they keep me tethered to this hope.

Friends have told me he’s shy but intentional. I believe that. And I relate. That’s what makes it so hard: I want to open the door a little wider, but I’m scared of pushing something that isn’t meant to be.

I guess I’m just wondering… what do you do with a longing that hasn’t fully begun—but still takes up so much of your heart?

I used to be obsessed with sugar. Like nonstop cravings, you’d have to surgically remove me from a slice a cheesecake before it was finished, everything.

And like a lot of people here, I decided I could just switch to lower calorie versions of sugary foods. I made myself at least two “desserts” everyday made mainly out of protein powder and stevia.

And yeah stevia/monkfruit/etc are good substitutes for sugar. And I still use them.

But they alone not going to stop you from constantly craving sugar.

You have to detach yourself from it.

I’m at a point now where I’m more likely to crave an egg than a cookie. I never thought that would be possible.

And yeah, if I eat something super sugary I still enjoy it. It just never really occurs to me to. It’s not something I’d choose on my own.

A few days ago a friend said we should get a sweet treat and my instant suggestion was “greek yogurt?” It didn’t even occur to me that that was unusual until everyone around me chuckled. That just happened to be the first sweet treat my mind thought of and craved.

Obviously yeah, you can still fit cake, cookies, ice cream, pop tarts, pie, etc into your calories and make it work. But the more of it you eat, the more you crave.

Eliminating/severely reducing it *until you’re not so addicted* is the best advice I can give. And then consume sugar in moderation.

Now I have a sugary coffee everyday, but I can live without it and don’t crave it. I like knowing that I’m at a point where I naturally crave healthier foods.

(And obviously I’m talking about processed/added sugar.)

Just a piece of advice for anyone who hasn’t tried yet.",26,1750261166.0,loseit,14,0.86,False

1lekahv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1lekahv/i_found_something/,I found something.,"Last night before bed, I found something that I had been looking for, for a long time. 

A missing piece. I can't remember if I had lost it during my pregnancy, during my post partum period, or during the pandemic. All three happened in such close succession, it was almost certainly a combination of the lot. 

But I found the missing piece and put it back where it belongs and now I remember what sort of thing I'm trying to build. 

A week ago in the parking lot of Chipotle, 

I found something 

on the ground 

as I got out of my car. 

It was a small, metallic, crescent moon. 

Much bigger than a quarter. Smaller than the palm of your hand. Well, it would fit neatly into the bottom of this small coffee mug I'm drinking from. 

I am not sure if it was actually intended to be a moon or if it was actually a large, stylized, hoop earring, that had lost the pin and clasp.   
  
The shape was that of the crescent moon. Or maybe the shape of he visible part of the sun, during an eclipse. 

It was badly scratched up by being run over repeatedly on the asphalt. Chips of metal flaked off of it when I picked it up. 

It was beautiful. 

Each scratch glittered in the overbearing summer sun. It was one of the most beautiful things I'd seen. 

And the points were sharp. And I was scared of it. 

That it might be contaminated. With some blood-borne illness. Especially if it was, indeed, a mangled earring. 

Or that it might be contaminat\*ing\* with the flecks of mysterious metal it was shedding. Because of course, in a capitalist hellscape, profit takes precedence over the sourcing of safe materials. 

And thus, there may be little incentive for steel magnates to exclude lead and cadmium from their ores. 

 But it was beautiful. Too beautiful to leave behind. Because the moon is sacred. sacred. 

And I could not leave it behind. 

So I wrapped it up and took it home with me. And washed it. 

And placed it somewhere sacred. Maybe it was an offering. 

Saturday night as I was getting ready for bed, something struck me like a memory. A memory of the future, of the previous iteration of the loop. 

\*Tomorrow, on my outing with my son at the mall, something will happen that changes my brain chemistry forever.\* 

I interrogated the thought. 

How do I know that? I'm not sure how I know but I am just sure of it. Well, it's a good bet, as it's a thing that often happens, isn't it? We go about our lives and encounter little conflicts that give us a story to tell and change the way we look at things? 

But...I am just too exhausted (I thought. Staring into the bathroom mirror in my night clothes). To chock full to the brim with small but significant and life-altering moments, I don't think I can stand to add another one. 

...This life just seems to go on and on and on and the memories just seem to keep building up like a concretion of sediment. Like a film or coating of scum that only builds and clogs and weighs down and ever-increases and is never removed. 

(I went to bed.) 

At the mall, I found something on the floor. It was $120. 

It didn't have a sacred gleam like a potentially toxic metal moon. Not even in florescent the glare of this bustling monument to consumerism.

But it screamed. It screamed in my exhausted hands.

So I divested myself of it.    

You can regret the choices you've made but you can't undo them. You can't reload to an earlier save point.

You need to be resourceful with what the choices you've already made have left you with. 

You need to decide, you need to remember, what sort of person you're trying to be. The kind of person who backpedals? 

You could back pedal \*over\* someone behind you in the path. Do you want to be that sort of person?

Now I remember what to do. Move forward decisively. Dwelling on, trying to backtrack to an already missed opportunity will only make one's position worse.

Maybe I already knew it. Maybe I just needed to experience a concentrated microcosm of it to fully grasp it. 

Maybe it was a gift.

The weakest.

The poorest.

A nobody.

How many of you could live with those titles?

For Gray, he didn't have much of a choice.

He was born with nothing. Raised with even less.

Gray had no talent, no skills, no wealth, no influential parents.

In a world ruled by money and strength, there was no doubt that Gray was at the bottom of the society.

At the age of 20, he spent his whole life, trying to survive.

He had done all he could do. He washed dishes in restaurants, cleaned toilets, carried heavy boxes, and scrubbed the walls.

He had no choice. He could only rely for himself to survive. What's more was that he has a little sister to take care of, his only family, after their parents passed away.

Gray worked three jobs a day just to keep a roof over their heads and a bowl of rice on the table.

And he had once never complained.

But life has a cruel way of testing people like him.

One rainy afternoon, Gray was sitting on the cold floor. He was dead tired after carrying heavy boxes for a few hours.

Gray's shirt clung to his back. It was soaked with sweat and rain. His arms were aching. And his legs felt like they would give up at any moment.

His work was still not done. But fortunately, they were allowed to take a short break before the next batch of deliveries arrived.

Gray was sitting on the ground when he heard footsteps getting near him. When he looked up, he saw his manager, Mr. White.

Mr. White was a balding man in his late fifties. He was a little bit big, maybe not too little, and his sagging face looked as if he had gone through the end of the world.

Mr. White had a mischievous expression on his face. He was playfully grinning as he approached Gray.

Gray slowly stood up to greet his manager.

""Sir?"" he asked, uncertain why the man was approaching him when Mr. White used to just pass by him every day.

Mr. White didn't meet his gaze. Rather, he looked disgusted that he was talking to Gray.

""You're Gray, right?"" he asked, even though they both knew the answer to it.

""Yes, sir."" Gray nodded slowly.

""Tch."" Mr. White scratched the back of his head, then pulled out a crumpled envelope from under his clipboard.

""Well, kid, I've got bad news for you.""

Gray's face paled as he stared at the envelope. He had encountered this situation countless times, and he couldn't be wrong about it.

'No… Don't tell me…'

""We're letting you go.""

The words hit him like a slap across the face.

""What?"" Gray blinked.

""We're cutting down on temporary workers. Company's orders."" Mr. White waved a hand lazily as if it was no big deal. ""It's nothing personal.""

Gray opened his mouth, but nothing came out of it.

""I—I've been working here for the last six months,"" he finally said. ""I never missed a day. I come early. I work overtime when no one else wants to—""

Mr. White sighed as if even listening was a chore for him.

""Look, I'm not your therapist, alright? Go complain to someone who cares. Take your final pay and get out. You're done.""

Mr. White shoved the envelope into Gray's chest as if he was even disgusted to be near him.

""…""

Gray had no choice but to accept the envelope that contained his last payment. It wasn't heavy. There was only a small stack of bills inside, not even enough to pay rent.

Gray's tired eyes looked down at the envelope, rainwater dripping from his sleeves onto the worn paper.

""This… this won't be enough to get us through the week,"" he whispered in the air, feeling as if the world had ended for him.

He had been fired from his two other jobs in the span of a month so he was struggling right now. This job was the only source of income he currently had, and he couldn't afford to lose it too.

But Mr. White had already turned around.

""It's not my problem, kid,"" he said over his shoulder. ""I don't care about you so make sure you're out by the end of the day.""

And just like that, Mr. White was gone.

Gray stood there, lifeless. He clenched his fist, and the envelope crumpled even more in his hands.

He had no backup plans. No savings.

Gray's legs gave out. He fell on the ground, sitting exactly from where he was sitting earlier. His vision blurred, but not from the rain.

He was a failure.

Useless.

How was he supposed to pay rent now?

How would he buy food for his sister?

Fuck life.

""Why?"" he thought. ""Why keep fighting when I'm this useless?""

He had tried. He had done everything he can to survive.

But life kept pushing him down.

His sister's face flashed in his mind. Her innocent smile, and her always cheerful voice.

. How could he face her now, when he couldn't even provide for her?

""God…"" Gray whispered, his voice trembling.

""How much longer do I need to suffer?""

The rain kept falling but he didn't care anymore.

Gray stood up and walked out of the warehouse. He didn't know where he was going, all he knew was that he kept walking and walking.

And a moment after, he found himself at the edge of a bridge.

His sister was probably waiting for him.

But how could he face her when he knew that he was useless now?

A failure?

Gray took a step forward at the end of the bridge, ready to end it all.

However, before he could do anything, an unknown sound pulled him back to reality.

\[Ding!\]

Gray froze, and then a voice filled his mind.

\[Welcome to the Great Tycoon System.\]

His body stiffened.

'What was this?'

\[You have been chosen. All your desires, power, and success can be obtained through wealth. Will you accept?\]

'What the hell is happening?'

\[Accept, and you will rise from nothing.\]

Desperation flooded Gray. He must be hallucinating right now, or crazy even. But what could he possibly lose more?

""I accept,"" he whispered.

\[Great Tycoon System had been Activated.\]

 



...

\[The Great Tycoon System has been activated.\]

\- - -

A translucent screen suddenly appeared in front of Gray. It was floating in midair.

""What the hell…?"" Gray blinked rapidly, his heart pounding loudly.

Was this some sort of joke?

Maybe he was losing his mind from exhaustion and hunger.

\[This is not a hallucination, Host.\]

The voice was calm and robotic, causing Gray to stiffen.

\[You have been chosen, Host. The system will assist you in obtaining wealth and power.\]

Gray shook his head in confusion.

""What's going on? What do you mean by 'chosen'? I don't even have money to survive…""

\[You have been granted a second chance. The system is here to help you rise from nothing.\]

His hands tightened around the crumpled envelope in his grip. His situation was already at its lowest, and now this voice was telling him he had a second chance.

Was he really hearing this?

""Second chance?"" Gray muttered, still trying to make sense of the situation.

\[You can complete missions to gain wealth, influence, and power. Completing missions will reward you with the means to change your life.\]

Gray's mind raced.

A second chance.

A way out of his miserable existence.

'No fucking way…'

Gray stood there in the rain. His lifeless eyes suddenly became filled with life.

""I'll do it. I'll take this second chance. I'll rise. I can't keep living like this."" He was determined.

\[Good choice, Host. The system is now granting you your starting funds.\]

'A starting fund?'

The screen in front of Gray flickered again before it displayed a new message.

\[Starting Funds: $10,000\]

""Wait... What?"" He rubbed his eyes in disbelief.

Was this for real?

Ten thousand dollars?

That was a fortune compared to what he had right now!

\[You have received $10,000.\]

\[Ding!\]

\[You have received your first new mission.\] 

\[Mission: Spend $10,000 within 48 hours.\]

\[Reward: $10,000 for you to save and a 5% rebate for your future purchase.\]

Gray stood frozen, staring at the screen.

'Spend it all?'

He could barely wrap his head around the idea of having that much money. He had never seen that much at once in his life.

Ang damn, he was about to go crazy.

A small and wide smile appeared on Gray's face. He shoved the envelope into his pocket and started walking.

Gray laughed as he walked. It was a deep and almost desperate laugh mixed with happiness and relief. He couldn't contain it.

For the first time in forever, he felt like something had changed.

""Wohhh!""

""Fuck you all!""

Gray was shouting, crying, and laughing at the same time.

""Ten thousand dollars?"" he muttered to himself, his voice was even cracking as he said it out loud.

 ""I can actually do this!""

""10,000? Fuck all of youuuu!""

Gray laughed even louder.

""Mama, mama. Look at that—""

In the distance, a woman and a child inside a car were staring outside.

The woman swiftly pulled her child closer.

""Don't look at him, my dear. He's probably on drugs. Don't involve yourself with men like that in the future, okay?"" she hissed, ushering the kid away.

""Poor guy must've lost it,"" another man murmured to his friend.

""Yes. Yes. I told you not to walk near the park when it's raining. There are too many crazy guys out here.""

Gray, who can't hear any of it was still laughing in happiness. Before he could know, he was already near their apartment. He just walked a few miles and he didn't even notice it!

""Alright,"" Gray muttered, wiping away the remaining tears in his eyes.

""Time to buy dinner for my dear sister!""

Gray walked into the small and familiar restaurant, just a few meters away from their apartment. The scent of sizzling meat and cooked vegetables filled the air.

It was a place he went to almost every day, not because the food was fancy, but because it was cheap, and they never judged him for the few coins he could scrape together when paying.

He goes here all the time that he was already considered a regular, and the owners knew him well by now.

As he walked up to the counter, the older woman behind it, Mrs. Liang, looked up and blinked in surprise.

""Are you okay?"" Mrs. Liang asked when she saw Gray dripping wet.

Gray wiped his face with his sleeve, still laughing under his breath as he stood at the counter. His clothes were soaked and his hair was sticking to his forehead, but there was a different look in his eyes.

Gray looked brighter.

""Yeah, I'm good,"" Gray said with a grin, trying to keep himself from laughing too much.

""Just got some... really good news.""

He leaned forward a little, lowering his voice as if he was about to tell her a secret.

""I want everything on the menu today. Give me everything my sister wants, too!""

Mrs. Liang blinked in surprise.

""Are you sure? Everything?"" She gave him a confused look. ""Did you win the lottery or something?""

Gray laughed softly, shaking his head.

""Lottery? No, nothing like that,"" he said with a shrug. ""But I'll be rich soon enough.""

Mrs. Liang's expression softened as she studied him. She paused for a moment before sighing.

""Gray... I know life's been hard for you, but don't get crazy. You know better than to start spending like that."" She gave him a concerned look, as if trying to make sure he wasn't losing touch with reality.

Gray just grinned, feeling the excitement bubbling inside him.

""Don't worry, Mrs. Liang. Everything's going to be fine."" He was still laughing softly to himself, excitement growing with each passing moment.

 



...

Gray walked up the narrow staircase of their apartment building, his heart was still racing with excitement. He reached the small apartment door and opened it.

""Lily? Are you there?!""

Their apartment was cramped, barely enough for him and his sister. The walls were pale white, and the furniture was old and worn out.

As soon as he opened the door, the small living room greeted him. It had a couch that sagged in the middle, a worn-out coffee table with a chipped surface, and a small kitchen just after it.

The air always smelled a bit musty, and the only window they had in the place was covered by thick curtains.

Gray stood in the doorway for a moment, feeling a strange sense of warmth despite the coldness that his body was feeling.

""Brother?"" a sweet and small voice from the inside echoed.

Gray moved his eyes, and there she was. His little sister, Lily, appeared from around the corner.

Lily was only ten years old. She was small and a little bit chubby. She had big bright eyes. Her hair was messy from playing alone and she wore a pink dress that was a little too big for her.

She was cute, with a round face and a wide smile that could melt anyone's heart.

Lily blinked when she saw Gray holding several bags of food. Her eyes widened in surprise, and she quickly rushed over to him.

""What's all this, brother?"" she asked, looking up at him with confusion.

""Did you win something? Why did you buy so much food? Did you forget that we're poor?""

Gray's heart softened when he heard her scolding. He laughed and placed the bags on the table with a grin.

""It's alright, Lily. Don't worry about it. Just trust your brother, okay?""

Lily stood still for a moment, clearly puzzled by his words.

""But... but we're poor, brother. How did you… oh no! Did you rob someone?""

""Hey! What do you think of me?"" Gray lightly smacked Lily's head, just enough for it to make a small sound.

Lily rubbed her head dramatically before pouting.

""Ouch! You really do have a strong hand, brother!"" She exclaimed out loud before showing a mischievous smile.

""But tell me honestly, brother. Did you rob someone? Oh no!""

Gray laughed in disbelief.

""We're already poor, Lily. I can't be a criminal. I might be crazy, but not that crazy."" He paused for a moment, looking at the bags of food on the table.

Lily tilted her head, still looking puzzled.

""But we never get this much food, brother. It's really a lot. Are you sure everything's okay?""

""Don't ask any more questions,"" Gray interrupted gently, giving her a playful wink. ""Just eat, or else I'll return all of this."" He couldn't help but smile, knowing that she'd take it seriously.

Lily giggled, her earlier confusion melting away.

""Joke, brother! You're so funny!"" She plopped down on the small chair, eagerly reaching for the food.

""Okay, okay. Let's eat then! This is the best meal ever!"" Gray chuckled.

Gray started unpacking the food he had bought, laying it out in front of them. There were all sorts of dishes, steamed rice, fried chicken, vegetables, and even a sweet dessert.

It was all the things Lily loved to eat, and at the same time, things they could rarely afford.

Lily's eyes sparkled as she saw the food.

""Wow, it looks amazing!"" She looked up at Gray with a shy smile. She was really lucky to have such a brother.

""Thank you so much, brother.""

Gray smiled back at her, feeling a warmth spread through him. He sat down at the small table, not even caring if his body was still slightly wet and cold.

Gray and Lily dug into the food immediately. They haven't eaten such a feast for years. Gray couldn't help but laugh as Lily made exaggerated sounds of delight with every bite.

""Mmm! Yummy! This fried chicken is so crispy! Brother, you're really the best!"" she said between mouthfuls, her cheeks puffing up as she chewed.

Gray grinned and shook his head as he watched her enjoy the meal.

""Of course, I am. Who else would feed you like this?"" he teased, poking her playfully.

Lily stuck her tongue out at him.

""You're definitely the best! But don't get too full of yourself, brother. It's bad, okay?""

Gray raised an eyebrow. ""Just keep on eating, Lily. You're hurting me.""

Lily giggled, covering her mouth.

""Okay, okay."" She grabbed another piece of chicken and wiggled it in the air. 

""When I grow up, brother, I'll also buy some food for you. I'll also buy you a chicken like this one!""

Gray chuckled, shaking his head.

""I'm looking forward to that day, then. But for now, just enjoy the food. It's for you.""

""Yes, Sir, Yes!""

The two continued to joke around as they ate. Their laughter filled their small and cozy apartment. The warmth from the food and the joy of being together made everything feel just a little bit better.

For a moment, it felt like they weren't living in poverty at all.

However, as the laughter died down, Lily's gaze also softened.

""Why? What's the problem?"" Gray noticed the shift in her mood.

Lily paused, her fork hovering in mid-air as she looked at him.

""Brother..."" she looked at Gray cautiously, ""Are you sure everything's okay? You've been acting a little... different lately. You looked tired in the past weeks, but now you're suddenly happy."" her voice was small

Gray froze for a moment with what Lily said. His heart sank. He didn't know that Lily noticed his tiredness these past few days.

""Of course, I am."" He quickly forced a smile, brushing it off.

""You're brother is strong.."" He reached across the table and ruffled her hair affectionately.

""Don't worry about me, alright? I'm your big brother. I'm always going to make sure you're okay. You just focus on eating and having fun.""

Lily seemed to hesitate, her lips pressing into a thin line as she studied his face. After a few seconds, she let out a small sigh.

""I trust you, brother. But if anything happens, promise me you'll tell me, okay?""

""I promise, Lily. I'll always tell you."" Gray smiled warmly.

But enough of that for now. You should get some rest tonight, okay? It's been a long day.""

Lily blinked, her eyes wide with curiosity. ""Why? It's not even that late yet.""

""Shush..."" Gray raised a finger and gave her a teasing grin.

""Because tomorrow, we're going to shop. And we'll shop until we drop.""

 



...

The next morning, Gray woke up, feeling as energetic as ever. He stretched his tired muscles and got out of bed.

Today was going to be a good day.

""La\~ La\~ la\~""

Gray was humming a good tone. As he stood up, he went to the other side of their apartment and saw Lily, who was still sleeping peacefully.

Gray chuckled and shook his head. He shouldn't wake her up and make breakfast first instead.

Gray quietly tiptoed to their small kitchen area. He was careful not to disturb Lily's peaceful sleep. He opened the fridge slowly, finding a lot of their leftover from yesterday. He could have reheated it, but he wanted to make it special for the two of them.

As he cracked the eggs into a pan, Gray recalled how happy Lily had been yesterday. Her smile after eating a lot of food was really special.

It was small things like that, that made him keep going in the past.

The eggs sizzled in the pan, and Gray hummed again. He smiled to himself, thinking about all the things he could buy today.

When Gray was done making breakfast, he decided it was time to wake her up.

Gray walked over to her bed, standing by her side for a moment. She was curled up under the blanket and her hair was so messy.

""Hey stupidhead, it's time to wake up,"" Gray gently shook her shoulder.

""Brother!"" Lily groaned and pulled the blanket over her head. ""Five more minutes,"" she mumbled, still half asleep.

""Come on, come on. Breakfast is ready, and it's your favorite."" Gray chuckled and nudged her again. ""

Lily's eyes slowly opened, and she peeked out from under the blanket. The talk of food was enough to drag her out of bed. She yawned, stretched her arms, and smiled at Gray.

""Okay, okay. I'm up!"" she was suddenly energetic.

""Good. Now go and eat already.""

Lily nodded and jumped out of bed, now fully awake. She ran to the kitchen immediately. Her eyes light up as the sight of fried eggs and toast filled her eyes.

""Wow, brother! It smells amazing!""

""I told you it was your favorite."" Gray laughed, glad to see her so excited.

Lily eagerly grabbed a plate and began piling the food on it.

""You're the best, brother!"" she exclaimed, taking a bite of the eggs and then the toast. She chewed happily, making satisfied sounds between bites.

Gray quickly joined her at the table. They ate in comfortable silence for a while, savoring the warmth of the food.

After breakfast, they both started getting ready for the day. Gray pulled on a plain shirt and jeans, trying to look presentable, while Lily wore one of her favorite dresses, a blue puff dress.

The dress was a little bit big for Lily, but still, it was the nicest dress she had. It was also one of the few things that Gray could afford in the past.

""How do I look, brother?"" she asked, spinning around.

""You look perfect, Lily. Are you now ready to go?"" Gray couldn't help but smile.

""I'm ready!"" Lily nodded enthusiastically.

The two of them left their apartment and made their way to the nearby mall. Gray was excited to see Lily's face once she saw the new clothes and toys she'd been dreaming of.

The mall wasn't too far, and soon enough, they were walking through the automatic doors of it.

""Which store should we go to first, Brother?"" Lily asked as she bounced around.

""I don't know, Lily."" Gray scratched the back of his head. He was also unsure, as it his first time to shop around.

Heck, it was his first time to receive $10,000 in one go.

""Go be crazy and I'll just follow you, okay?""

""Okay!""

And just like that, Lily dragged him around. The two of them went to a store that sells all kinds of children's things.

Lily picked out a few items. There was a stuffed bear and some clothes. Gray just let him do what he wanted. He just stayed on the side and watched her with a sense of pride, happy to be giving her this experience.

However…

""Wait a minute,"" he muttered to himself, feeling a bit of panic rising in his chest.

Gray's eyes widened. He quickly went through his pocket and then checked his wallet.

""Don't tell me…"" His wallet was empty.

He forgot to ask the system where's the money!

Lily stopped bouncing and looked up at him.

""What's wrong, brother?""

Gray awkwardly chuckled. He had completely forgotten to check the money before they left.

""There's nothing wrong, just shop there okay? I'll stay on the side.""

""Are you sure?""

""Yes, go on.""

""Alright!""

When Lily went to go around first, Gray faced the wall on one side.

'Okay system, how do I access that money?'

Suddenly, a soft ding echoed in Gray's ears. A small and glowing message also appeared in the corner of his vision.

\[Ding!\]

\[You can access your funds via this card, Host.\]

Before Gray could even react, something cool and smooth appeared in his right hand. He flinched in surprise, looking down at it.

'What the fuck?'

It was a sleek black card. It looked simple at first glance. There were no numbers, no name, just a silver logo at the center.

ABC Universal Bank.

""Whoa…"" His eyes widened. still trying to process what just happened.

Not only did the system give him $10,000 to spend, but also gave him a card from one of the most powerful banks in the world!

""Okay... So I just swipe the card and it works? That simple?"" He mumbled to himself,

\[Yes, Host. The card will work in any store.\]

""Guess it's really working, huh?"" Gray looked up at the bright mall ceiling and let out a little laugh.

Just as Gray turned around, Lily came back with her arms filled with clothes and toys.

""Brother! I'm done!"" she said brightly. ""Look at all this! Can we get it all?""

""Of course. Let's go check out."" Gray smiled and ruffled her hair.

They walked together to the cashier, who blinked in surprise at the pile of items being placed on the counter.

As the register beeped repeatedly with each scan, the total rose quickly. Gray watched calmly, now completely confident because he got the card with him.

The cashier finally looked up. ""That'll be $738.95.""

Gray nodded and pulled out the black card. He handed it over casually.

The cashier took one look at the card, and her eyes widened slightly.

'Woah! They don't look rich. Seems like I judged too early.' Her hands moved more carefully now as she took the card and slid it through the machine.

Beep.

\[Transaction Approved\]

""Thank you for shopping with us,"" the cashier said with a sudden polite tone, smiling as she handed the card back with both hands.

""Please come again.""

\[$738.95 has been deducted from your balance.\]

\[Available Balance: $9,261.05\]

\[Duration left: 30:46:09\]

 



...

""Good, good."" Gray slipped the card back into his pocket. A satisfied smile formed on his face.

""Can we go to the toy store next, Brother? The big one?"" Lily grabbed his hand. She was practically glowing with happiness.

It was her first time to get a lot of things, and it was also the first time that her brother paid without worrying about anything. She thought that she should take this as an opportunity before it stopped.

""Of course, Lily,"" Gray answered with a chuckle. ""I told you that we'll go crazy today. So go and lead the way.""

""Yay!"" Lily jumped out in joy.

And so, their crazy spending began.

\[Ding!\]

\[$312.40 has been deducted from your balance.\]

\[Available Balance: $8,948.65\]

They moved on to a shoe store next. Lily picked out two sparkly sneakers and one pair of pink boots that lit up when she stomped. Gray also got himself a decent pair of running shoes.

\[$418.60 has been deducted from your balance.\]

\[Available Balance: $8,530.05\]

In the next store, they bought some clothes. Most of it was for Lily, since her clothes right now were either too big or too small.

\[$429.99 has been deducted from your balance.\]

\[Available Balance: $8,100.06\]

And, after a few hours, they took a short break at a restaurant. It was a well-known restaurant that they had dreamt of getting inside in the past. And now, who would have thought that they could actually go inside of it already?

The restaurant was fancy. It was probably the fanciest place they had been to. When they stepped inside, the lights were soft and warm, the floor was shiny and gentle music played in the background.

Lily held Gray's hand tightly as a waitress led them to a table near the big windows.

""Right this way, Sir"" The waitress uttered with a smile though on the inside, she was silently judging the two with the way they dressed,

Gray and Lily sat down on a comfortable couch. Lily pressed her face against the glass, looking at the people outside. She was amazed to be sitting in such a fancy place.

Gray, on the other hand, picked up the menu and scanned through it.

""Wow… this stuff is expensive,"" he said under his breath.

'This is such a scam. How come a plate of pasta costs 50 dollars? You can cook a whole meal with that cost!' He was dumbfounded at the prices.

But since they were already here, might as well experience it one time and dip after.

""What do you want to eat, Lily?"" Gray turned to Lily who was giggling as she looked at the people.

""You can decide brother. Anything you buy is good."" Lily answered innocently, her eyes were shining with interest.

""Alright, alright…"" Gray sighed and looked at the menu once again.

The menu was written with words that he couldn't even pronounce.

'I didn't know being rich is this hard…' Gray sighed for another time.

Still, he didn't want to look dumb in front of Lily, or the waitress, who was standing nearby, pretending not to listen but clearly paying attention to them.

So, Gray cleared his throat and pointed at a few random items.

""We'll get this one… and this one with the creamy thing, and this one, and this cake."" he said, handing over the menu.

""And for drinks?"" the waitress asked, raising an eyebrow.

""Uh… strawberry milkshake for her,"" he said quickly. ""And I'll just take water.""

""Of course,"" she said with a polite nod, then walked away.

Gray let out a breath of relief. Lily looked at him, clearly excited.

""Did you order a cake too?""

""Of course,"" he grinned.

They waited for a few minutes, just enjoying the view and the warm feeling of the place. Lily was swinging her legs under the table, humming softly.

When the food arrived, her eyes went wide.

A big plate of creamy pasta, grilled steak with a shiny sauce on it, and a rich chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side filed their table.

""Whoa…"" Lily said, her mouth was almost drooling.

The two started eating, and both of them were amazed at how good the food tasted. The pasta was creamy and cheesy, the steak was soft and juicy, and the cake was warm and gooey inside.

""This is so yummy!"" Lily said with her mouth full.

Gray just smiled as he chewed.

However, just as they were halfway through the meal, a man appeared at the side of their table.

""Well, well… Gray Adams? Is That really you?""

Gray froze for a second when he heard his name being.

That voice…

He slowly looked up.

Standing beside their table was a tall guy in a neat coat. His hair was neatly styled, and he was wearing a silver watch that looked expensive. The guy was also smiling, but it wasn't that kind of smile from a friendly person.

""…Nathan,"" Gray muttered the guy's name.

Nathan was his old classmate. And the one person who made his school days a nightmare.

The guy was always teasing him, pushing him around, calling him names just because he was poor.",1,1750260957.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1lek7xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1lek7xt/bijagua_amazing_experience/,Bijagua - Amazing Experience!,"Just got back from our first trip last night and just wanted to give a quick plug for Bijagua.  What a wonderful, authentic (at least to us!) experience.  Spending 3 nights there was an absolute pleasure.  We...

\- stayed at Casitas Tenorio for 3 nights.  Nana and Jeffry were amazing hosts.  We did the morning farm tour and our kids (7 and 5) got to hold bunnies, get eggs from the chicken coop, feed sheep, and pet Frankie the giant but gentle bull.  The grounds were beautiful, breakfast was great, and we were able to easily get dinner delivered the last evening when we didn't feel like going out again in the rain.  We saw a group of 6-7 howler monkeys every day too very up close. Lovely, lovely place.

\- We used an incredible guide via [Bijagua Rainforest Tours](https://www.bijaguarainforesttours.com/) named Manfred who took us to Rio Celeste and another private garden.  There were 7 of us and we found the price very reasonable, especially considering it included door to door transport, lunch at a great local soda, and coffee, juice, fresh fruit, and freshly made empanadas at the end right out of the skillet.  We saw 2 vipers, a white faced monkey, a blue jeans frog, and a sloth just 5 feet or so above us that we were easily able to observe for 20+ mins.  This was an incredible day.

\- The next day we did both the Heliconias hanging bridges hike and a tour at the Tree Chocolate Farm.  Both were phenomenal.  Heliconias was even better than I expected - the bridges are amazingly high up and long and that part of the rainforest was so thick and wild...absolutely loved it.  Tree was great too and we had a private tour for 7 for like $80 grand total.  The guide, Richard, was awesome and showed so many diff plants and flowers that we could smell and even taste.  GREAT chocolate at the end too.

\- the grocery store in town was well stocked and great to load up in.  There was a really quaint and nice souvenir store attached to the righthand side of the Pizzeria Barrigon restaurant.  We ate at Cafe Semilla (twice), Restaurante La Donta, Hummingbird Cafe at Finca Verde, and Blue River Brewery.  All were great and super well priced.

I've seen many people say to just spend a night here only for going to Rio Celeste and we highly disagree.  This town/area is well worth 3 nights if you can.  AND...it'll save you money too vs other areas.  Restaurants are very reasonable (and good food!) and our casita (which had 3 beds and 1.5 baths) was too.

Also...logistically it's phenomenal.  Easy 90 min drive from the airport that is basically just 2 roads...all were well paved and easy.  And then once in Bijagua, EVERYTHING is super close and easy to get to.  Heliconias was literally 5 mins from Casitas Tenorio as was the private garden where we did the sloth portion of the Rio Celeste tour.  Finca Verde was 10 mins max away too and you can do tours/walks there also.  This meant we could do a lot, see a lot, BUT also not rush constantly and have a couple hours of down time before dinner every day too.  It was great.

i quite literally cannot find any bit of care for myself in me. i refuse food, water, everything because i hate myself so much and feel as if i don’t deserve it. i keep telling myself that ill only deserve it if i have a mom. if she yells at me that day, i wont eat or drink.  

it’s to the point where im using the restroom once a day, and thats me forcing myself to, and its extremely painful when i do. i’m crying about her constantly and no tears are even coming out. i’m also constantly hot and not able to cool down or sweat, and im living in a heat wave currently. i’ll drink like a cup of black coffee in the morning and maybe a few sips of water if she’s being nice to me that day.

""And honestly? The kid's gonna be totally fine with River. You don't need to put yourself through some brutal custody war—especially when we both know how that's gonna end","Chapter 1 The day after we finished dividing up the assets from our divorce, I got into a car accident and lost my memory. Later, my ex-husband River Kane tracked me down. He said if I stopped acting crazy all the time, maybe we could get remarried. I was mid-bite on my ice cream spoon and just froze. After a long pause, I finally managed: ""Uh, no thanks! I mean... I... I'm actually totally fine just keeping the money. I woke up to find my best friend Mackenzie staring at me with this super worried expression plastered all over her face. Hey, don't beat yourself up anymore, okay?"" she said, trying to sound all reassuring. Look, your body is your temple, babe. Even if you're going through this divorce mess, you still gotta live your best life. She sat down on the edge of my bed, fidgeting with her phone. ""And honestly? The kid's gonna be totally fine with River. You don't need to put yourself through some brutal custody war—especially when we both know how that's gonna end. I just stared at her, my brain feeling like it was wrapped in cotton. After what felt like forever, I finally managed to get the words out. ""Um... who the hell is River? Mackenzie froze mid-sentence, looking at me like I'd just spoken in tongues. It took her a hot minute to snap out of it before she bolted to get the doctor. The doctor said I had memory loss from the car accident. Mackenzie immediately jumped in, asking how old I thought I was. I said without any hesitation. ""Eighteen. Didn't I just finish my SATs yesterday? Mackenzie completely lost it. She literally crumpled to the floor, laughing so hard she was clutching her stomach and pounding the side of my hospital bed with her fist. Willa, oh my GOD! This amnesia thing is like... the universe giving you the ultimate do-over! Yes! You're eighteen, baby! Eighteen and free! No River, no kid, no drama... just you and me against the world! Now I was even more confused than before.Mackenzie took me back to her place once the doctors confirmed my memory probably wasn't coming back anytime soon. That's when she finally gave me the rundown on my apparently very messy life. Me—Willa Reynolds—fell head over heels for some broke college guy named River during freshman year. I spent ten whole years with this dude, from eighteen to twenty-eight. Stuck by him while he was building his empire from nothing, lived off ramen and dreams, popped out two kids for him, and basically became his family's live-in caretaker. And this year? He decided to divorce my ass. ""Wait, WHAT?"" I practically shrieked. This sounded like some tragic Lifetime movie bullshit. After I got over the initial shock, I asked in this shaky voice, ""So you're telling me I spent a decade being someone's unpaid servant, and then got kicked to the curb at twenty-eight?"" Mackenzie nodded grimly. ""Yep. And you've got two kids—your son's six, your daughter's four. But since you were a stay-at-home mom with zero income, and the kids chose to stay with daddy, River got full custody."" ""Hold up... so I lost the kids I spent years raising too?"" Even though I couldn't remember any of this, it sounded absolutely terrifying. I was about to start ugly crying. Then Mackenzie's whole vibe shifted, and she actually smiled while patting my shoulder. ""Hey, don't look so miserable. At least you're loaded now."" I blinked back tears and asked cautiously, ""How loaded are we talking?"" Mackenzie sat up straight, looking way too pleased with herself. ""Willa, listen carefully. You walked away with twenty percent of River's assets, ten percent stakes in three publicly traded companies, and two historic townhouses in Manhattan. We're talking about nine hundred million dollars."" Dead silence. I stared at her, then asked slowly, ""Mackenzie... you're not messing with me, right?"" ""If I'm lying, I'm literally a piece of shit."" That day, I spent hours just staring out the window at the sky. I'd lost ten years of memories. I had no clue what my life had been like during that time. But Mackenzie said I was rich as hell, and eighteen-year-old me had always been obsessed with money. So honestly? I guess this isn't too bad. Chapter 2 Mackenzie took time off work to help me sort through endless paperwork and property transfers. I never actually met this River guy—he had his lawyers handle everything in the divorce settlement. After nearly a month of bureaucratic hell, Mackenzie helped me list all my properties as rentals. She did the math and told me I'd be pulling in about one-twenty thousand a month just in rent. That day, staring at my bank account with more zeros than I could count, I looked up at the mirror. The reflection showed a perfectly put-together twenty-eight-year-old version of myself. I scratched my head. Wow. Not bad at all. I had nothing but time on my hands while Mackenzie went back to work, so I basically lived at her place playing video games all day. She'd order food for both of us during lunch breaks. Mackenzie worked insane hours and would come home looking like death warmed over, collapsing on the couch like a zombie. I'd put down my controller and give her shoulder rubs. Apparently muscle memory was still intact because I was surprisingly good at it. Once she'd recovered enough to form sentences, she'd start ranting: ""River is such a piece of shit. Right after you graduated, you were basically his unpaid intern. And when his mom got sick, you'd come home from work just to give her massages and take care of her."" Mackenzie kept going, then suddenly grabbed my head and flicked my forehead. ""Willa, you were such a pushover! The second I wasn't around, you let them walk all over you. That whole family treated you like garbage because they knew you didn't have anyone else."" I rubbed my forehead, feeling genuinely hurt. ""Hey, I don't remember any of that stuff! All I remember is you."" Mackenzie stopped mid-rant, then broke into a huge grin. ""You're right! You don't remember, and that's perfect. Just remember me—I'd never treat you like that."" I believed her completely, because Mackenzie and I grew up together. We were both foster kids. When we were little, I basically followed Mackenzie around everywhere. She'd fight other kids for snacks and help me with laundry. As we got older, she'd help me with homework. She was a year ahead of me, so when I was a senior, she was already in college, calling me every single day to keep me motivated. She wanted us to go to the same university, but Mackenzie was way too smart. Even when I studied my ass off, I couldn't get into Harvard like she did. The day our test scores came out, I just hugged her and cried. Mackenzie flicked my forehead again. ""What are you crying for? You got a 1480 on your SATs—that's amazing!"" She ruffled my hair. ""You did great."" I ended up crying all the way to Boston for college. Chapter 3 Talking about it just made Mackenzie feel guilty all over again. ""I never should've let you go to Boston in the first place. If you hadn't gone to Boston, you never would've met River. If you'd never met River..."" I jumped in with the obvious answer: ""Then I wouldn't have nine hundred million dollars."" Mackenzie put her hands on her hips. ""What's more important—the money or those ten years of your life?"" I tried to guess the right answer: ""The money?"" Mackenzie looked like she wanted to shake some sense into me. ""YOU'RE what's important! If you're miserable, all that money is worthless. Thank God you lost your memory, because if you remembered everything and did something stupid to yourself, what good would any of that money do?"" ""Well... it could buy me a really nice headstone..."" Mackenzie cracked up despite herself. ""Oh my God, shut UP!"" Mackenzie had always been incredible, and she still was. She was now a VP at some multinational corporation, pulling in around forty grand a month. But she was constantly swamped with work and business trips, and she worried about leaving me alone. So she started dragging me along everywhere. Eventually she figured if she had to babysit me anyway, why not put me to work? She got me hired as her assistant at her company. I was so ready for this! I'd spent months reading like fifteen different romance novels about powerful bosses falling for their assistants. On my first day, I strutted in wearing this killer business dress, feeling like I could take on the world. I made her coffee, organized her files, ran around doing errands. I was trying so hard to impress her that she finally started laughing and told me to chill. She handed me a spreadsheet and said, ""Have Ava show you the ropes on this. Take your time learning—no rush."" ""Got it!"" And just like that, I officially entered the workforce. I started following Mackenzie's schedule, but since I didn't have much on my plate, I usually got off work way earlier than her. Mackenzie, on the other hand, was buried in work. I'd hang out in the break room waiting for her to finish up every night. One day, Mackenzie caught me watching online tutorials on my phone and suddenly got serious. ""Willa, do you actually want to learn this stuff for real?"" ""Yeah... I really do."" With the memory loss, I was basically starting from zero at work. I kept screwing things up and it was getting pretty depressing. Mackenzie had always been my role model growing up, and that hadn't changed. I wanted to be as effortlessly competent as she was. She made everything look so easy and cool. So Mackenzie enrolled me in classes. After work every day, I'd drive to night school.

1lek5kn,https://i.redd.it/rcrlfjetfp7f1.jpeg,"Once She Dreamed - 1 by Abbi Glines : I shared a room with my three sisters. Always had. We lived in a house with only five rooms, two of those being for beds. Yawning I wondered if I’d ever get to sleep late. Just one day in my life have a chance to sleep past seven. Oh, what a","Chapter One “Eggs don’t gather themselves,” were the familiar words my momma called out at five a.m. this morning, as she swung open our bedroom door. I shared a room with my three sisters. Always had. We lived in a house with only five rooms, two of those being for beds.  Yawning I wondered if I’d ever get to sleep late. Just one day in my life have a chance to sleep past seven. Oh, what a treat that would be. “Stop daydreaming and go get the eggs. Sammy Jo, did you hear me? Momma will go to hollering in a few minutes if they’re not in the kitchen. Do I got to do everythin’ around here?” Milly was the oldest of the four of us. She just turned nineteen this past September. We thought she might get married to that Garner boy but he ran off to join the Marines. No one expected that. Especially Milly, didn’t see it coming. However, I think momma was more let down than Milly. She was hoping for one less mouth to feed.  “Are you listening?” she yelled at me this time.  Sighing, I covered yet another yawn and glared at Milly above me. She acted bossy, but truth of it is, I’m only eleven months younger than her. I would turn nineteen this August. “I hear you. Jesus, stop with the yapping,” I grumbled and lightly coughed.  Hazel giggled behind me. I turned my head to wink at my sister. At only ten years old Hazel was the youngest and I thought she’d be the baby forever, daddy having passed on from skin cancer, which seemed to freeze her in time. Make Hazel forever the baby. Then three years ago momma hooked up with a man traveling through town and all he left her was a swollen tummy. Now, none of us wish it any different. Henry is adored by the lot of us. “I’m not milking the damn cow again,” Bessy said, stomping her feet, putting both her hands on her hips with all of Bessy’s dramatic flair. “I did it last week. It’s someone else’s turn.” Bessy was fifteen and exhausting. I really hoped she ended up on a stage. She would be a superstar with all that drama that comes so natural to her. “You’re scared of the chickens,” Milly reminded her. “Milk the cow or go feed the hogs. You said they stunk last week. Make up your mind and stop cussing like a man.” I finished gathering the eggs and headed for the house. Those two would bicker over cows for several more minutes at least. When momma yelled I didn’t want trouble. I had plans tonight and I needed her in a mood, the best one currently possible. “Come back and help little Diva with the milking,” Milly called out after me. I ignored her. She wasn’t my boss. Opening the screen door I stepped into the kitchen. Momma’s back was to me as she cut the shortening and butter into the flour for biscuits. “Want me to put the pot roast in the slow cooker?” I asked trying to be helpful. Overly helpful mind you. “I reckon we need to do that. Vilma didn’t say how old it was so I don’t want a roast going bad. Was nice of her to bring it over like that. Something to say for good neighbors.” Maybe so, good neighbors, but this here town was not my idea of a life. I wanted out of Moulton. Out of Alabama. Anywhere but here. There was a big ol’ world waiting to meet me and my dream was to see it all. Or as much as I could in a life. I pulled my pale blonde hair into the rubber band I kept on my wrist as a habit. The morning breeze had tangled my hair. I didn’t care, I was low maintenance, I’d brush the wads out later. I had some sucking up to my momma to do to convince her to let me go with Jamie and Ben to a concert. Tonight in Cullman, Alabama was Rock the South and they had an extra ticket. I’d never been to a concert before. “Momma, what time do you have to go to work?” I asked, pulling out the slow cooker, looking for things to be done, though I’m a worker and she expects this. “Need to be at the bakery by eight. Sara got there at five this morning to start the morning pastries. I’m on cupcakes and cookies today. Thought I’d try a new banana bread too. Those always sell good, no matter.” Momma had been working for Sweethouse Bakery for over twelve years this month. Some weeks she did the morning shift and we were left with Milly to wake us. Those days were not my favorite. “You’re working the front counter from nine to four. Be early Sammy Jo. I left a list of things for Bessy and Hazel to do around the house. Bessy needs to keep an eye on the roast. The list is there on the table.” “Yes ma’am,” I replied, walking over to the table, jotting down Bessy’s chore. While I worked with momma at the bakery, Milly went to cosmetology school. She passed her exams and had a new job at the only hair salon in town, the one and only to ever exist. She didn’t have to go to work until ten every morning but she often worked till seven. Sometimes worked right past it. I had no idea there were so many heads to cut and groom and style. There were barely over three thousand residents in Moulton, Alabama proper. How a hair salon could stay that busy was beyond my imagination. Where were these folks going? The bakery sat close enough to the main road headed from Cullman to Florence. That gave it commuter traffic. But a hair salon in Moulton, Alabama seemed plain silly to me. All folks do is stare at each other, in the street, at church or home. If they were bald, they’d do the same thing. “Momma! Momma! I lost my fwog!” Henry called to her as he burst through the door with dirt smeared on his face already, his bottom lip pooched and trembling. “Go wash up and get ready for breakfast. More frogs where he came from. You can catch one later.” Her response was unconcerned. I made a mental note to help Henry find a frog after breakfast, if not sooner. His bottom lip stayed pooched as he nodded his head then walked back to the bathroom. Momma had never babied him, but he sure got enough from his sisters. “Is Bessy and Hazel watching Henry today or is he going to the bakery with us?” I asked chopping up the celery to add to the roast, taking a nibble now and then. “Bessy can watch him. He hates being there. Says the women pinch at his cheeks. Makes ‘em eat up all the profits.” He ate his weight in cookies and momma hated that. But there was nothing much for Henry to do at the bakery where Henry had actually been born. Momma hadn’t been able to take days off at the end of her pregnancy then. We flat needed the money to eat. Milly and I had been working after school to help but it wasn’t enough. When momma’s water broke there had been no time to get her to Cullman to the hospital. Henry was born on the tile floor with the help of Sara and Vilma. I felt bad for momma. The whole situation. She had a baby with her babies around her, no father there to help. After losing my daddy I didn’t figure a man could live up to his memory. But still…I wondered if momma had been scared. She sure didn’t seem to be. That day I made a promise to myself. I wouldn’t have a baby on the floor of a bakery without its daddy around. I’d marry a man who loved me and could give me the world in pieces. When our baby was born he’d be holding my hand safely nestled somewhere else, likely in a hospital in New York City, Chicago, Boston, or maybe Seattle, anywhere but here. Chapter Two The smell of strawberry cupcakes filled the air of the bakery making my stomach rumble. I longed, but could not taste. Momma would slap my hand. She could tell when I wanted to touch one. Inside the cake were fresh strawberries and the icing was made with cream cheese. Homemade, not from the carton. I’d watched momma make them many times. I always wanted to lick the spoon, but never got the chance. It was after two and I hadn’t got the nerve to ask momma if I could go to the concert. I kept waiting to catch her when she wasn’t so busy, but she’d been working most of the day, sweating and straining in the kitchen, skipping lunch to stay ahead. There hadn’t been a good time to ask her. Momma could not stop. The bell above the doo r chimed, snapping me out of my cupcake gaze. I quickly stood up from my stool and got my smile in the greeting position. My breath caught just a little as I took in the man in front of me. He was tall and also beautiful, and he dressed and smelled expensive. I could smell his expensiveness over the cupcakes and that was saying a lot. Men like him didn’t walk into here, not a bakery in Moulton, Alabama. “Hello,” I said cheerily. “We have fresh strawberry cupcakes that just came out of the oven. There’s also warm apple tarts and blueberry muffins with blueberries that came off the farm, straight outta Mable Richards’ field.” Although I normally told everyone who walked in the bakery what we had available, I felt silly saying it to him. He didn’t seem like the kind to eat any of that stuff. I’d imagined he drank champagne, ate caviar, or something like that. “Oh, and we have banana nut bread. It’s new and I haven’t had any, but my momma never makes anything from scratch that ain’t just perfectly delicious.” I had to add that and sound even sillier. And that was pretty silly. His gaze stopped scanning the small tiny bakery and then it locked on me. His eyes were green. Around them clear white. Not the dark green that almost looks brown, but light green, like light on grass. The kind that makes you want to stare right at them, while they’re staring right at you. For a long long time, or forever and ever, either one was fine. “What do you suggest?” When his deep voice asked it was thick like the whiskey I’d tried with Ben that time. He’d snuck it out of his dad’s private stash. “Huh?” That was all that came out of my mouth. That man’s voice was intoxicating. He even sounded expensive I tell you. I hadn’t known people could sound expensive. Like he had gold in his stomach or something. A grin tugged at his lips and I caught myself smiling back at him. I bet his full smile was something else. “What item do you suggest I try?” He repeated himself and oh, the man was trying to order. I shook my head to clear it then glanced down at the cupcakes waiting there. “The strawberry cupcakes are delicious. I mean, uh, I think they are. They smell so good and have fresh strawberries and I imagine they taste real nice.” “I’ll take three,” he replied. I beamed. He was going to love them. “Okay,” I said, reaching for a box before slipping on the plastic gloves. We had to wear them when touching the food. “Do you serve coffee?” he asked. I nodded. “Oh yes! We have a fresh pot on. I’ll get you a large if you like?” “Thank you,” he responded. I wanted to look back at him, but I kept my attention on my task, tried not to drop anything. “Does your momma own the place?” His voice interrupted my concentration and I almost dropped the cupcakes. “My momma?” I repeated then laughed a little. “No, my momma just works here. Sure wish she could own a place like this. She’d be real good at it.” I placed his box of cupcakes on the counter then put his coffee right beside it. “That’ll be seven dollars and fifty-two cents.” I folded napkins on top of the box and goofily smiled with embarrassment. From a fist-sized wad he pulled a ten-dollar bill and handed it across the counter. “Keep the change,” he said. That was two dollars and forty-eight cents he was leaving behind for a tip. Why in the world would he do that? I started to speak when he opened the box and withdrew a fresh baked cupcake. The smell hit my nose and I inhaled deeply, he taking a napkin and his coffee in hand and he was ready to test my opinion. “If it’s as good as you say it is, I’m sure I’ll be right back.” He then turned to leave kind of slowly. His box with the other two cupcakes sat on the counter as placed. I picked them up and then called out. “You’re forgetting your other cupcakes!” He stopped at the door and turned back to me grinning. A real smile crept across his face. “I bought those for you,” he replied. Then he left. Just like that. Walked away before I could even say thank you. I looked down at the cupcakes and my mouth began to water, but I wouldn’t eat them both. I’d take one home for Henry. Momma may not be thrilled about it, but the man bought the cupcakes for me. I didn’t ask him to and Henry would love it and that’s all I needed to know. Opening the box back up I lifted a cupcake out. Then I took my very first bite. It melted on my tongue like sugar. My toes curled in my shoes. “Sammy Jo what are you doing!” My momma’s voice startled me to shaking. When I opened my eyes to see her, she was glaring at me with that special momma stare, like a naughty child had been caught. “It’s mine,” I replied, my mouth still full of the yummy goodness I was holding. “A man just bought three and left me two.” I finished chewing wishing I could savor the taste left in my mouth. “A man did what?” she asked, her hands on her hips as she huffed. “A man,” I said pointing at the door. “He was just in here, just now. He asked me what I’d buy if it were up to me and I told him the strawberry cupcakes. So he then bought three with a coffee. He took one out, said the others were for me, and walked right out the door.” Momma sighed and shook her head then mumbled something. She wasn’t happy, but I was eating my cupcake, so I was having a hard time caring. “I won’t eat both. I’m taking Henry the other.” I figured mentioning Henry would soften her up. It didn’t soften her any. “You shouldn’t allow strange men to buy you things. Men only buy women gifts, because they’re after sex and the way you look” -she shook her finger at me and frowned- “you can see in a mirror just fine. The Lord decided to give you all them looks and men notice them for what they want. Ain’t got nothing to do with you. And you got to be careful about it.” I had heard this lecture before. About men wanting me and me needing to protect myself from the predators about. Daddy had warned me when I started junior high. He said, “you’re too pretty for your own damn good and I’d hate to have to shoot some boy, for forgettin’ you’re my child.” “He walked out before I could stop him. Momma, he was rich. He even smelled expensive. He won’t be coming back around here. People here don’t look like him.” Momma frowned and stared at the door. “He’ll be back. He got a look at you. That’s all it takes to return.” She then turned and headed back to the kitchen. I wasn’t sure how I felt about my very own momma thinking men all wanted me. I didn’t particularly believe I was really that attractive, especially to a man like that one. Chapter Three I knew after the cupcake incident momma would say no to the concert. But I’d held out hope and asked anyway and yep, she said no. She needed me home for shelling picked peas and canning them after that. In June parts of the garden were ready and each month we had things to put up. We ate from our garden all winter. Next month would be tomatoes and I hated canning them. But I also hated shelling peas. Milly had been asked on a date. Robbie Long was his name and since momma was hoping to marry her off real soon, she let her go hoping he would ask. The rest of us were sitting under the oak shelling peas and chatting amongst us. Even Henry was shelling away. Technically, Ben had been a date. Sure we had been friends forever and we weren’t about to get married, but still, it seemed unfair. I couldn’t date at all. Instead my fingers were getting raw from the hulls and we still had several more steps to go before we could sleep. I had to admit, if telling the truth, that the cupcake was completely worth it. Henry agreed with that. Most of the icing ended up on his face, which made him even cuter. As if that was possible to do. “Tell me about the cupcake man. Again, tell it once more.” Bessy was starry eyed about the whole idea. You might say slightly possessed. “Nothing to tell,” momma replied, with a grumble and a snap of her fingers. Bessy looked disappointed. She knew not to push momma when she sounded like that. I knew the same so I didn’t. “I want annuder cupcate,” Henry said, smiling at the last of his words. “On your birthday,” momma replied. That sent him into singing the happy birthday song and he sang it and sang it and sang it. “When do I get to work at the bakery?” Bessy asked and Bessy knew the answer. She wouldn’t get to work there anytime soon. Momma needed her to watch little Henry during the summer months. I didn’t say that to her. She hadn’t been asking me. “When Sammy Jo marries and moves on,” was momma’s quick reply. Visions of me marrying a man and “moving on” danced in my head and I smiled. That was my favorite daydream. Problem was no one around here was going to sweep me off my feet. Or take me out of this town. They’d all die here in Moulton. Spend their lives barely leaving and their lives would be done. I was headed in that direction. “She’s picky. Lots of guys ask her out but Sammy Jo never goes,” Bessy said, frowning at me. “She’s the prettiest girl in this town but she never dates any boys.” I had heard this before and I was tiring of defending myself on the subject. “No guy in this town can get me away. I want to see the world. I don’t want to set up house in Moulton and spit out babies till I’m old.” Bessy rolled her eyes. “Ain’t nothing wrong with that. Your looks got you all high falutin’. You think you deserve more than me and it ain’t fair you know. If I’d been born with your blonde hair, big boobs and dancer’s legs, I’d have me a man already with a house all to myself.” I wanted Bessy to dream bigger than that, but like Milly that wasn’t possible. “I don’t just want a man. I want an epic romance.” Bessy laughed and tossed an empty shell into the trash with disgust. “You’ve been reading too many books.” “That’s enough,” momma said. “I’m tired of hearing this.” She handed me a gallon sized bucket of peas already shelled. “Go on inside with these. Vilma lent me her fancy pressure canner. Said it’s safer to use than the old one. Go figure it out. Get it going. She left directions beside it.” This was momma’s way to get rid of me. She wanted quiet on the subject of marriage. Not once had she ever corrected me for wanting out of here. She seemed to agree with me. And I think she believed I’d achieve it. I would. Yes, I would. “Me ont to go too,” Henry said, running toward me and smiling. “That’s fine. Stay away from the canning. You could get hurt,” momma told him. I returned little Henry’s grin. “I’ll let you help me fill the jars with peas.” He clapped like that was exciting and I guess to him it was. Funny thing was I hated peas. Every jar we canned meant I’d have to eat them at some point along the way. I’d much rather be canning fruit. Or making strawberry preserves. Then I could appreciate the hard work. When I stepped inside the phone was ringing. I sat the pot of peas on the table and hurried to pick it up. “Hello” “Hey, Sam, Jamie said you couldn’t go tonight. Thought I’d call and see if I could change your mind. I got that ticket for you. Hate to give it to someone else.” Ben was the sweetest guy I knew. He had moved to Moulton to live with his dad when he was in the fourth grade. Jamie and I had been best friends since kindergarten. We saw the shy little boy with glasses and I pulled him into our pack. The three of us had been close ever since. Except sometimes I felt like Ben might want more than that. At least lately I felt that way. He treated me different than Jamie. She had brought it up a few times and I had tried to change the subject. But she wasn’t the only one picking that up. Ben was definitely acting interested. Like he had a spotlight on me. “Momma has us canning peas tonight. You know how much I love that.” I added sarcasm to my voice so he would understand that I had really wanted to go with them. “That sucks. You don’t think I could talk her into letting you go?” he asked with hope in his tone. If I tried to get momma in here to chat she might put me in the pressure canner. “Uh, no. She already has me inside starting the canning process. Milly May is on a date and that’s the only child momma can spare tonight. She needs me here. I really wanted to go. Thank you for the invite.” Maybe it was best that I wasn’t going. I didn’t want Ben to get the wrong idea. He’d always just be my friend. One of my best friends ever and there’s something to say for that. “Yeah, okay. I understand. Jerry’s wanting to go so he can have your ticket. I’ll miss you though, I will.” Not a “we will miss you,” but an “I will miss you.” Yikes…I had to get us back to the way we were. Maybe I could fix Ben up with a girl in town or something like that? “That’s a good idea. Jerry will love it. Y’all have fun,” I told him. “Bye, Sam.” His voice held a touch of sadness. Me not going was that sadness in his voice. That frightened and scared me I tell you. “Bye,” I replied, then quickly hung up. I had to talk to Jamie about this. We needed to fix Ben up with someone else and fast. I didn’t want to lose a friendship because Ben might think there was more to us in the future. He was my buddy. He needed to remember that. Ben was Moulton. He’d never leave. I had dreams. And they weren’t in this town. Chapter Four I hadn’t expected to see Ben and Jamie walking in the door of the bakery the next morning. Although it was almost lunchtime it was still early for them. I was sure their night had been a late one. I wanted to hear what had happened, but not with momma around. “Hey y’all,” I said, happy to see them. Jamie immediately chimed in about the smell: “God it smells like heaven in here. I’d weigh two hundred pounds if I worked here. I struggle enough as it is. How you work in this bakery and don’t get fat is unfair you precious thing.” Jamie always fussed about her weight. She wasn’t fat, Jamie was curvy. She always battled to shed fifteen pounds but I thought she was fine like she was. “If you had my momma you’d not gain weight,” I whispered, cupping my hand over my mouth. Ben frowned and looked at the lemon cupcakes alongside the blueberry muffins. Beside them were the apple tarts. “Shame she won’t let you eat that.” “No it’s not. It’s a gift from God. She’d be fat if she could,” Jamie argued, slapping his arm in a way that seemed less friendly, more “look at me,” which was interesting and intriguing I admit. “Sam doesn’t eat enough to get fat. And she hardly ever sits still.” Ben argued as if he were defending my weight. Then his eyes shot across me really fast. Like a shadow or a beam from the sun, as if to see if I’d really heard him. Jamie rolled her eyes, but she seemed a little hurt, annoyed you might say. Maybe I was reading too much into this though there was something in her gestures. Something Ben was missing… and I had also missed it apparently. “One day I’ll bake my own cupcakes. Eat ‘em until I’m so fat I waddle and then tump over.” I teased, wanting to lighten the mood, because I had to change the tenseness. Jamie laughed: “sure you will. You’ll marry some guy from another state and run off to see the world. You have the looks, just need Mr. Wonderful to discover you hereabouts.” She sighed and looked around the bakery. “Not sure he’ll find you here.” “Why would she move to another state?” Ben asked and seemed annoyed. “Because she’s been talking about it since she was five years old. She doesn’t want to live in a two-story house in the middle of Moulton, Alabama, with five kids and a farmer for a husband. She wants an adventure. Listen to her!” Jamie knew me well. We had stretched ourselves on the steep grassy hill behind my house on many summer days discussing our dreams and wants. We were girls wanting to be women, forgetting that the now was simpler, when later it wouldn’t be. Jamie’s dream was exactly what she’d just said she didn’t want for me. I wondered if Ben knew that.

Let me start by saying that I absolutely adore my NF. They’re great employers, even better human beings, and I really feel lucky to have them. Sometimes, they’re forgetful but that’s expected as parents & people who have jobs. 

I’m with NK2 three days a week for 11-14 hours a day. During those days, we are on long walks, we go to friends’ houses to play, go to the park, etc. 

Well… parents forgot the stroller in their car. 

I literally cannot do anything except stay in the house / be in the yard. No walks, no grabbing coffee, no park, no friends. 

The last time this happened, it was a miserable day trying to keep NK occupied and entertained with no screens. At least when we’re out and about, I point out things, we talk to people, I meet up with other kiddos… 

I’m about to buy my own stroller to keep here on days they forget it in their car. 

Wish me luck today. It’s gonna be a long one. ",5,1750260619.0,Nanny,26,0.73,False

1lek2x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Taurusgang/comments/1lek2x2/what_happened_to_my_relationship_with_taurus_man/,What happened to my relationship with Taurus man and I should not reach out?,"I’m a Cancer, and don’t really believe in star signs, for full disclosure. I met a stranger who blew my mind away with her knowledge..so maybe there’s something to this.

These events are a year old. So this is more curiosity. This guy, we’ll call him Y, and I met at work. We have a 7 year gap and I am 34. He’s a Taurus and I’m not sure what unfolded was a Taurus thing, or he’s just immature.

TLDR below. Sorry writing is therapy for me.

We have a great connection. Could tell he fancied me in not the most serious way, like just interested in talking to me. But he seemed to be getting more interested, so I tell him about my bf.

My relationship though, was falling apart. One day, when both of us were in the office late, I unintentionally trauma dump him when he asks me if I’m ok (basically death of a family member and a crazy boss).

He truly is an amazing listener. He offered a hug, and it felt intimate but sincere. I saw something change in him that day (which was confirmed months later). Like he was hooked on me (despite knowing I’m in  a relationship, which I don’t share is falling apart).

He starts messaging me off work hours, asks me to coffee/drinks. I refuse because I know if I engage in it, I’m going to emotionally cheat on my then bf. Plus don’t want to shit where I eat. Its more frequent but not everyday.

We become closer for sure, but then he goes on year end holidays. We don’t have each others personal contact. He comes back to work and he messages me and asks if we can move to personal number.

I agree, broke up with my bf over the holidays. He says he wants to see me. We meet, my friends saw us and were like, poor guy, he’s really into her, lol. He was also leaving the job in a couple months, and I got a different team, so shit where you eat was not a problem.

It was the most intense chemistry I felt with anyone. I tell him that I’ve broken up. He tells me he’s saw someone for like one date before the holidays. Ok too bad for me! But I genuinely was happy for him. When I like someone, I want them to have the best life, with me or not.

He looked like he was about to kiss me. Seemed offended when I refused to squeeze next to him in a really tight train seat. But again, I’m like, he’s got someone else he’s seeing now, so I’m just imagining that. He makes a point to tell me he’s not seeing her just saw her for one date and is planning another. I’m like cool, here are a bunch of places to go :)

Anyway, months pass, we talk almost everyday. He makes an effort to see me once or twice a week. He doesn’t ask me out on a date, just will pop up in the office (when he can work remotely) and when he left, he still came to events, and will ask to meet me.

But these encounters could be as brief as 10mins or like 5 hours. He seems like a workaholic and I am too, so no judgement from me. I’m not in a rush so I chill. Surprised he hasn’t made a move but confident I’m the only one. He starts calling me and we’ll chat for like 30 mins a week.

Another guy in the office flirts with me, I tell him because I felt I shared way too much with that guy. He just responds with these emojis 🤪🤥 and even kinda mad at me the next day. I had no intention of making him jealous and just told myself don’t tell him these things. I don’t want to upset him.

He was almost always the one to text first, but I also try to return the favour. We were in a good place but he seemed to be freaking out a bit. We banter a lot and I jokingly say he’s a finance bro and he asks me, are you you asking me if I am a brother (with the typo lol). He comes to see me the next day and bumps me goodbye like a bro.

I change my status on whatsapp and within two hours he asks me about it. And it was like 10pm at night. He starts complimenting my physical appearance at an event two days prior, before this, only that I’m a gem of a person and that I’m such a great person bla bla.

Ok things seem to he heating up. I have to move, he offers to help, like 3 times. I take him up on it, but because this was a smaller move (I had stuff in two apartments), I think he thought this was bullshit excuse to sleep with him (it was not).

He tells me the day of the move that he’s been going out on dates, and how girls think he’s a player because he looks lime a jock, but he really is sincere. Women seem to always want him physically but they don’t realize he’s not like that. I’m like okay. Not very bothered but more in acceptance that maybe he just likes my company. I was turned off by some of the things he was saying because this was unusual from him. Its like he’s trying to show off? He also seemed to be breathing heavily the last few times we met. I thought maybe he’s tired.

We reach my apartment. He asks to see my room (culturally I come from a place where people don’t do physical things UNTIL you confirm you like each other). I just think, room tour. He just says this is where the magic happens, and what’s my move. I’m confused because he says he’s on dates with other people.  I just assumed he was joking and I just say nothing and leave the room.

He seemed really upset as we left my room. He asked me if I was lesbian, and when I said no, he’s like what kinda guys you’re into. I just said I don’t care about looks, just the character. Up until that day, he truly was the most amazing person. In a very genuine way. I was kinda not used to him being like this.

I offer to get his uber home (he told me prior to reaching my apartment he couldn’t stay because he had a party. In my head I’m like okay, we’re nearly done anyway, but thought there’s a time crunch and would get him an uber)

I tell him now I know his address (in a joking flirty way, can’t help doing that because that’s our dynamic). He says, I can bang his roommates (yeah, like I don’t know what happened to the sweet guy I knew).

So as he gets home, I text him a thank you. He says I’m so sweet. I tell him I glad I met him, despite the situation we were in at work with said crazy boss. He says he feels the same. I tell him that I’m happy to be friends but I can’t be his bro (in that don’t tell me sordid details of your dates). He asks me what I meant by friends and not bros and what’s the difference?

He ends up calling me before I could text back. I explain to him that I didn’t like a lot of things he said today, without saying anything explicitly. Just don’t treat me like a bro. He even asked me about me using buttplugs. Like one moment he’s telling me about these dates with other women, next moment he asks me that.

We talk for one more day then its silence for 3 weeks. Not even on read. Until my guy friends point out that he wanted to sleep with me. Well that flew over my head. They were all like, he was either trying to make you jealous, or just wanted you to know this is just sex.

I’m upset. I text him saying now I know what his intentions were all along. He finally reads my messages. But I block him. I was so disappointed.

But he emails me the next day. Just apologizes for not responding sooner and offering to call me if I was up to it. I called him cruel and bla bla, a very long email like this post, but in the end I just say I want an explanation via email.

He doesn’t reply. I’m sure he didn’t get past the first line. We bumped into each other at an event. I email him, saying that I know he’s not that person, that I had feelings for him, but what happened was not ok. But I’m sorry things didn’t work out, for my own closure. He emails me back, says sorry for making me feel this way, and we should talk. It didn’t sound good for me but just happy to get closure.

He said he will TRY to call me tomorrow because he’s helping his friends who joined a protest to get out of jail. I got pissed (when I don’t usually react, I just told him the most vulnerable things and while I was ok not having the call that day, but couldn’t accept the “try” part of it). I just said if the call happens it happens, if not we’re good.

He responds 4 days later, we’re good. I reach out to him a bunch of times after, he ghosts me.

Now what happened? I know a communication break down but how could you go from liking someone to ghosting them like that? I know I made plenty of mistakes too, but I could never cut someone off like that. It still feels cruel. Is this a Taurus thing? Am I harassing him if I reach out again? This stranger just came up to me a month ago and said your true love is a Taurus and never to reject him physically without explanation. Like its their form of love. Then I obviously started thinking of him.

I know I shouldn’t reach out because he likely never cared about me, but I do miss our friendship. Hard to accept we were never friends. I’ve moved on now but I think we could still have a friendship.

TLDR: i liked this guy and he seemed to like me back. He ghosts me and I don’t know whether this is a Taurus thing or his immaturity",2,1750260601.0,Taurusgang,4,1.0,False

1lek2pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lek2pu/finding_hope_again/,Finding Hope Again.,"Hi everyone,

I just wanted to share something personal and uplifting because I’ve been reflecting on how far I’ve come.

A few months ago, I was in a really dark place. Life felt heavy, and I didn’t see a way out of the struggles I was facing. I didn’t talk about it much because I thought nobody would understand.

But one day, a friend reached out, not to offer solutions, but just to listen. That simple act reminded me that I didn’t have to carry everything alone. Slowly, I started finding small joys in everyday things: a cup of coffee in the morning, the warmth of the sun on my face, the sound of my favorite song.

Now, life isn’t perfect, but I feel like I’m walking toward the light again. I wanted to post this as a reminder that even in our darkest times, hope exists. Sometimes, it’s in the smallest, simplest things.

If you’re struggling, please know you’re not alone. There’s a whole world of people who care, even strangers on the internet like us. You’re stronger than you think, and better days are ahead.

Thanks for letting me share. Sending love and good vibes to everyone here. ",1,1750260588.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I walk in and there she is, sleeves rolled up, mug tilted under the faucet, and whistling. She even brings dish soap in her purse. The kicker? She always glare at me for using the actual breakroom sink.

I don't know. Maybe the bathroom is her safe space. Or maybe it's just her routine. If it bring her peace, who am I to judge? I just wish my brain didn't immediately imagine a mug collecting bathroom Wi-Fi signals every time I take a sip.",1,1750260566.0,coworkerstories,0,1.0,False

Olivia's POV



""Wake up, Olivia,"" Mom's voice echoed in my sleep.



I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""



""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""



""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.



""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.



I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.



""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""



""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""



I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.



The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.



Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

That was before everything fell apart.



My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.



But everything changed the night of the setup.



I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.



Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.



Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.



What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.



I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.



""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but… we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""



I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.



""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.



""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.



Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.



""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.



I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.



The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.



There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.



I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.



""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.



I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.



She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.



My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.



She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.



She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.



""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.



""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""



My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.



Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.



""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""



Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.



I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?



""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""



Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""



Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.



""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.



I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.



As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.



Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""



I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.



Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""



A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.



When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.



...

Olivia's POV



Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.



The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.



But that was before.



Before everything fell apart.



Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.



""Who cleaned my room yesterday?"" Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.



I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. ""I did.""



Lennox's expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.



""Then tell me, Omega,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, ""where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?""



I froze, my heart racing as Lennox's words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.



""I… I didn't see any necklace,"" I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.



Lennox's eyes narrowed. ""Don't lie to me, Omega,"" he growled, his tone laced with anger. ""The necklace didn't just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.""



""I'm not lying!"" I protested, panic creeping into my voice. ""I cleaned the room, but I didn't take anything. I swear!""



He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. ""You expect me to believe that?"" he snapped. ""You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.""



His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.



""I didn't take it,"" I repeated, my voice steadier this time. ""You can search me if you don't believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.""



Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.



I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers' pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.



Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.



""I can't find it, Olivia. It's gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?"" he asked in anger.



I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. ""I did not take it…""



""Lies!"" he angrily cut me off.





Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. ""This doesn't make sense,"" he muttered. ""You cleaned my room. You were the last one here."" His gaze hardened. ""Don't lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?""



When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.



""You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!"" he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.



Lennox's words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn't matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.



""Only two people came into this room yesterday,"" Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. ""You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?""



I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.



I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior's silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha's Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.



Who would dare enter Lennox's room and steal something so valuable?



No one.



No one except Anita.



But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn't say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I'd only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.



""I didn't take it,"" I said again.



Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. ""You think I'm stupid, don't you?""



I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn't. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn't matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.



""You know what, Olivia?"" Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. ""I'm done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn't turn up by the end of the day, I'll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.""



His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. ""I didn't take it,"" I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.



Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. ""I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,"" he growled.



I didn't need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.



Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn't believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.



""Here you are, Olivia,"" a guard said as he walked over to me. ""Levi is looking for you, and he doesn't seem happy.""



The guard's announcement made my heart sink in fear.



""Why? What happened?"" I asked, terrified.



Joshua, the guard, shook his head. ""I don't know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.""



Shit! What could it be this time?



...

Olivia's POV



""Start talking, Olivia… before I lose my patience,"" Levi demanded, his voice laced with anger.



I stood frozen, unable to form words as I struggled to process the accusation. Again. I was being accused of stealing—again.



""Olivia!"" His voice thundered through the room. ""Don't make me lose my patience! Where is the bundle of dollar notes I kept in my drawer? Speak, you thief!""



My eyes widened in shock. But Before I could respond, the door to Levi's room burst open, and Louis stormed in, seething with rage.



""Olivia, where is the money I kept in my drawer?"" Louis demanded.



I took a step back, my breath hitching as both Levi and Louis glared at me with fiery rage. My heart pounded in my chest—not out of guilt, but out of sheer disbelief. This wasn't happening. Not again.



""I didn't take anything,"" I managed to say, my voice trembling.



Levi scoffed, running a frustrated hand through his hair. ""Really? Then tell us who else could have taken it. Who else enters our room if not you?""



Louis folded his arms, his frown deepening. ""Don't play innocent, Olivia. Just return the money and save us all the drama.""



Tears gathered in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. At least not now.



Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced myself to speak. ""I didn't take your money,"" I repeated, louder this time, my voice shaking with suppressed emotion. ""I would never steal from any of you.""



""Liar!""



I flinched at the new voice and turned to see Lennox standing at the doorway. His eyes, filled with cold hatred, locked onto mine.



""The necklace I bought for Anita is missing too,"" he announced, turning to his brothers.



All three of them—Levi, Louis, and Lennox—looked at me as if I were the worst kind of filth.



Levi was the first to walk toward me, and out of panic, I tried to run away, but it was useless. I was surrounded by the triplets.



Levi pinned me against the wall, lifting my hands above my head while his burning glare was staring right into my eyes.



""This is your last chance to confess and return what you stole, or you'll be dealt with accordingly,"" he threatened.



A tear slid down my cheek as I met his angry gaze. I knew, regardless of what I said, they would never believe that I didn't steal from them. They would never believe that their precious Anita was the one stealing from them.



""One… two…"" Levi began counting, and all I could do was shed more tears.



I sobbed silently, knowing the punishment for stealing in this household was brutal. Some thieves were thrown into the dungeons, like my father. Others had their hands chopped off. Some faced even worse fates.



As Levi counted, my mind raced. Would I end up like my father, rotting in a dungeon? Or worse?



""Ten.""



He released my wrists and took a step back.



""She's just like her father—a stubborn thief,"" Lennox sneered. More tears slipped down my cheeks.



""Guards! Bring some maids!"" Louis ordered sharply.



As we waited for the arrival of the maids, my heart raced in my chest. What were these men going to do to me? Why were they sending for maids?



My gaze met Lennox's, and he glared at me with so much hate, which made me wonder—did he really hate me just because my father was accused of stealing? Was this all about it, or was there something else involved? How could a man who once cherished me now look at me with such disgust?



Three maids walked in and bowed their heads to the triplets.



Levi was the one to usher the punishment. ""Take her to the mansion rooftop. Strip her and apply pepper to her naked body. Make sure she kneels under the sun.""



A tear slid down my cheek, but I didn't say a word. Compared to what was done to anyone accused of stealing, this was a lesser punishment for me.



""Take her away,"" Lennox demanded coldly.



The maids took hold of my arms and led me out of the room. I didn't struggle. There was no point. As we walked through the mansion, I saw my mother. She was sobbing, her entire body trembling, but she didn't dare approach me. If she did, she'd share my punishment.



When we reached the rooftop, the maids let go of me.



""Please undress,"" one of them urged softly.



I hesitated, my entire body trembling, but there was no escape. Swallowing hard, I began removing my clothes, my tears falling freely.



One of the maids picked up a bowl of ground pepper and moved closer. My body tensed.



The moment the first handful of pepper touched my skin, an agonized scream tore from my lips. My body convulsed as the fiery sting spread across my skin. They rubbed it everywhere—every inch of my exposed flesh except for my face. The burning sensation was unbearable. My knees buckled, but I forced myself to stay upright.



""You have to kneel,"" one of the maids said.



I hesitated, but my body was already giving in. Slowly, I sank to my knees, my sobs wracking my entire being. The scorching sun hit down on me, intensifying the torment. My entire body felt like it was on fire.



How could anyone be so cruel?



I wanted to scream, to beg for the pain to stop, but I knew it would only make things worse.



It was as if the sun was against me because it began to heat even more. My whole body was burning with pain, and it felt like I would pass out soon. The pain was unbearable. I had never imagined I would go through such torture.



With tear-filled eyes, I looked at the maids who stood in a corner, staring at me with pity. Painful tears trickled down my cheeks while my entire body burned. As the excruciating pain enveloped me, my vision blurred, and my head spun.



Painful memories flashed through my mind. The triplets used to adore me. They used to fight over who got to spend more time with me. They used to playfully argue about which one of them would marry me when we grew up.



How did everything change so drastically?



How did men who once cherished me suddenly hate me so much?



I wished my father hadn't been framed. I wished he had been proven innocent. Then, maybe… maybe, the triplets wouldn't hate me this much.



The fiery sting of the pepper intensified, searing every inch of my exposed skin. I struggled to remain upright, my knees weakening beneath me. With each agonizing breath, the world seemed to tilt and sway until, finally, I could no longer fight the overwhelming sensation of nausea and torment.



My body gave way, and I crumpled to the ground. Distant voices called my name, but I was already slipping into darkness, into the past. Into the days when the triplets swore they'd protect me. Back when they fought over who would marry me, not who would break me. But those boys were gone. And so was I.



...

Lennox's POV



An uncomfortable silence hung in the air as neither my brothers nor I spoke. The tension was thick, almost suffocating. An uneasy feeling settled in my chest as my thoughts drifted to Olivia—to the pain she might be going through. A part of me wanted to stop the punishment, to let it go. But if I did, it would show weakness, a soft spot for her. And I didn't want that. I couldn't afford that. Not after what she did to me.



""I wonder what she plans to do with all the things she stole,"" Levi spat, his voice sharp with anger, breaking the silence.



I turned to look at him, noticing the anger in his eyes. He was just as pissed as I was.



""Maybe she has a boyfriend she plans to give them to,"" Louis grunted.



The mere thought of that sent a sharp, uncomfortable pain through my chest, but I shoved it down and stood abruptly. ""Tell the guards to search her things. Perhaps they're still in her room.""



Without waiting for a response, I left the room, heading back to mine.



The mess I had created in my earlier frustration still littered in my room—broken glass, overturned furniture, scattered papers. I ignored it and walked straight to the minibar, grabbing a bottle of whiskey. Uncorking it, I took a long swig, feeling the burn slide down my throat.



With a sigh, I sank onto the bed, but no matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept drifting back to Olivia. The punishment she was enduring on the rooftop. I glanced at the window—the sun was scorching.



""If you're so worried about her, then stop the punishment."" My wolf's voice rumbled in my head.



I clenched my jaw. ""Why should I? Did she think about how I felt years ago when she hurt me? When she said those things?""



The door to my room pushed open, and Anita stepped inside. Her brows furrowed as she took in the mess in my room before her gaze landed on the whiskey bottle in my hand.



""Lennox, are you drinking because of the missing necklace?"" she asked, concern lacing her voice.



I swallowed hard. No. The necklace wasn't why I was drowning myself in whiskey. It was Olivia. But I couldn't say that to Anita.



""Yes. It was a gift for you,"" I murmured instead.



Anita sighed and walked closer, kneeling before me. Gently, she took the bottle from my hand and placed it aside before looking directly into my eyes.



""You don't have to do this to yourself over a necklace. You can always get me another one, right?"" she said, her voice soft, comforting.



And she was right. Money wasn't the issue. My brothers and I were the sons of the richest Alpha in the world and soon to be Alphas. A stolen diamond necklace shouldn't be enough to put me in this mood.



""Or…"" Anita tilted her head, her gaze searching mine. ""Is there something else bothering you?"" Anita asked, raising a suspicious brow.



I quickly shook my head.



She studied me for a moment before a slow smirk curled her lips. ""I know exactly what you need.""



Before I could ask what she meant, she reached for the hem of her dress and pulled it over her head, letting the fabric fall to the floor. My gaze traveled over her exposed skin, the smooth curves of her body.



""Come on,"" she whispered, her voice sultry. ""Let me help you take out your frustration.""



I said nothing as she unclasped her bra, letting it slide off her shoulders. Then, she moved closer, pressing her body against mine. Her hands traced down my chest, her fingers slowly unbuttoning my shirt before pushing it off.



""Use me, Lennox,"" she breathed, tilting her head up to meet my gaze. ""Pour all your anger into me. Take what you need.""



A dark hunger stirred inside me—the need to lose myself, to forget everything—even if just for a moment. I grabbed the back of her neck, pulling her into a bruising kiss. She gasped against my lips, but I didn't slow down. I pushed her back onto the bed, climbing over her, my body pressing her into the mattress. I ran hungry and angry kisses all over her body before pulling away and standing before her.



Anita lay back on the bed, her legs spread, her body on full display for me. Her smirk was teasing, her eyes dark with anticipation. She knew what I wanted—what I needed—and she was more than willing to give it to me.



I didn't waste time. My belt hit the floor with a sharp clink, and I shoved my pants down, my cock already hard and aching. I crawled onto the bed, grabbing Anita's ankles and yanking her closer, making her gasp in surprise.



""So rough, so dominant,"" she purred, but I wasn't in the mood for her teasing.



I wrapped my fingers around her throat, squeezing just enough to make her gasp. ""Shut up,"" I growled, watching her eyes widen with excitement.



Her lips parted, her breath hitching as I tightened my grip just a little more. ""Yes, Master,"" she whispered.



That sent a dark thrill through me. I released her throat and grabbed her hips, flipping her onto her stomach in one swift motion. She barely had time to brace herself before I yanked her up onto her knees, positioning her exactly how I wanted.



I ran a hand down her spine, feeling her shiver under my touch. ""You're wet already,"" I noted darkly, dragging my fingers through her slick folds.



She whimpered, pressing back against me, silently begging for more.



But I wasn't feeling generous tonight.



I grabbed a fistful of her hair, yanking her head back as I aligned myself with her entrance. ""Beg for it,"" I commanded.



She moaned, her fingers gripping the sheets. ""Please, Master,"" she gasped. ""I need you.""



That was all I needed.



With one hard thrust, I slammed into her, making her cry out. I didn't give her time to adjust—I didn't want to. I set a brutal pace from the start, pounding into her relentlessly. The bed frame creaked beneath us, the sound of skin slapping against skin filling the room.



Anita moaned loudly, her body rocking forward with every thrust, but I pulled her back against me, keeping her exactly where I wanted. My grip on her hips was bruising, my nails digging into her flesh as I took her hard and rough, just the way I needed.



""Who do you belong to?"" I growled, yanking her head back again.



""You, Lennox,"" she panted, her voice breaking with pleasure. ""Only you.""



I smirked darkly. ""Damn right.""



I released her hair and pressed her chest down onto the mattress, driving deeper into her. My control was slipping, my wolf growling as I fucked her like an animal.



She was screaming now, her body shuddering beneath me, but I didn't stop. I couldn't stop. Not until I had taken everything I wanted from her.



And I wasn't done yet.



Anita's body trembled beneath me, her moans filling the room as I drove into her relentlessly. But no matter how hard I took her, no matter how much she screamed my name, it wasn't enough.



Because it wasn't her.



I clenched my jaw, trying to push the thought away, but it was useless. My mind betrayed me, painting a different picture. It wasn't Anita's dark hair spilling over her shoulders—it was Olivia's. It wasn't Anita's moans filling my ears—it was Olivia's breathless whimpers, the way I knew she'd sound if I ever had her like this.



""Lennox…"" Anita gasped, her voice breaking with pleasure as she arched her back, pressing against me. But for a moment, I didn't hear Anita. I heard Olivia.



A violent need surged through me. I pulled out of her suddenly, making her whimper at the loss. Before she could protest, I flipped onto my back and grabbed her by the waist, pulling her over me.



""Ride me,"" I ordered, my voice rough with need.



Anita grinned, straddling me eagerly. She reached down, positioning herself before sinking onto my cock with a moan. Her head fell back, her nails digging into my chest as she took me deep.



I gritted my teeth, my hands gripping her hips tightly as she began to move. But I wasn't watching Anita anymore.



I was watching Olivia.



In my mind, it was her above me, her red lips parted in breathless pleasure. It was her soft skin beneath my hands, her tight pussy wrapped around me.



""Fuck,"" I growled, my grip tightening. I drove my hips up hard, making Anita cry out. But all I saw was Olivia.



How would she look like this? Would she be shy? Would she try to fight the pleasure, or would she surrender to it completely?



I imagined her whimpering my name, her nails dragging down my chest as she came apart for me.



A low, possessive growl rumbled from my chest. Olivia wasn't supposed to be in my head like this. She wasn't supposed to be the one I craved. I hated her. She had hurt me, but I couldn't stop thinking about her.



And no matter how hard I tried, no matter how many times I fucked Anita or anyone else, no one could take her place.



Anita's pace quickened, her nails scraping against my chest as she rode me harder, chasing her release. My grip on her hips was firm, guiding her movements, but my mind was elsewhere.



Not here. Not with her.



With Olivia.



I could almost see her—imagine the way her body would tremble above me, the way her lips would part in a gasp as she took me deep. My control slipped at the thought, my grip tightening as I thrust up into Anita with brutal force.



""Lennox—"" Anita gasped, her body tensing. She was close.



I was too.



With one last punishing thrust, I sent her over the edge. Her body clenched around me as she cried out, shuddering in pleasure. The sensation pushed me past my limit, and with a low growl, I let go.



Pleasure ripped through me, my release spilling into the condom as I buried myself deep inside her. My breathing was heavy, my chest rising and falling as I rode out the aftershocks.



For a brief moment, silence filled the room, broken only by Anita's soft panting.



Then, without a word, I reached down and pulled out of her. My body was still humming with satisfaction, but the moment was already fading.



Because it wasn't Olivia.



It never was.



Anita stretched beside me, her fingers lazily trailing down my chest. ""Damn, that was hot,"" she breathed.



I didn't respond. Instead, I reached over and pulled her into my arms. For a moment, we didn't say a word until the door opened and Levi and Louis walked in.



""So you two were having fun without us,"" Louis said, and Anita, loving the attention, giggled softly.



""Move away, Lennox,"" Levi grumbled.



I sighed and rolled out of bed as Levi and Louis positioned themselves beside Anita, wasting no time before devouring her like hungry animals.



I moved away from the bed, walking into the bathroom and turning on the shower. As I stood under the cold water, I could still hear the muffled moans coming from my room.



My brothers and I did practically everything together. We shared everything—so sharing Anita, or any other woman, was nothing new. But we also competed against each other.



Who was the best fighter.

The strongest wolf.

The fastest shifter.



Sometimes, it even came down to who fucked better. Who Anita enjoyed more.



And most importantly—who would end up being her mate.



We all knew that on her eighteenth birthday, she would be mated to one of us. And if fate was cruel enough, to all three of us.



And whoever she was mated to would be Dad's favorite. The pack's favored Alpha.



So, in a way, we were all competing for her.



But that didn't mean we didn't love each other.



Sighing heavily, I thought of Olivia, of the good memories I had of her. Of how I fell in love with her even as just a little boy of twelve. How I competed with my brothers, assuming they liked her too.



As we grew older, I thought she liked me too.



But I was wrong. So damn wrong.



Turning off the shower, I tied a towel around my waist and walked back into the room.



Back in my room, I found Levi and Louis fucking Anita dominantly. She was on her knees, Levi's cock in her mouth while Louis fucked her from behind.



Their moans filled the air, but I ignored them, walking over to grab a pair of simple track pants. I needed a run. I needed to clear my head.



I pulled them on and left the room without another word.



But just as I stepped into the hallway, a female servant rushed up to me, looking panicked.



""Young master, Olivia just fainted on the rooftop,"" she announced, her voice trembling.



My breath caught. Panic surged through me, but I forced myself to stay composed.



""Then wake her up and send her back in,"" I said, sounding nonchalant as I hid my worry.



""That's the problem,"" the servant insisted.

""We've tried waking her, but she's not responding.""



I furrowed my brow, my frown deepening. ""What do you mean?""



She swallowed hard, her eyes wide with fear. ""She's not breathing.""",1,1750260566.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

“I’m not interested in him,” you said once, almost dismissively, as if it didn’t matter, as if that cleared the air between us.

Still, you kept talking, and I kept listening, because that’s what I did. I listened when you needed to be heard. I smiled when you smiled. I held your pain gently when you couldn’t.

But inside, something shifted. Not because I stopped loving you, I never did. But because I realized love shouldn’t feel like waiting in a room where only one person notices the silence.

“You deserve someone who loves you the way you want to be loved,” I whispered one day, my voice barely louder than the steam rising from our cups.

You looked up then, startled, maybe even confused. There was something in your eyes, regret, or understanding, or both.

Leaving wasn’t about giving up. It was about choosing myself. Because sometimes love means stepping away, not because you don’t feel it, but because you finally understand that being loved in return shouldn’t come at the cost of being seen.

Even now, I hope you find your peace, your smile, your clarity, even if it was never meant to be with me.",2,1750260477.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

Olivia's POV



""Wake up, Olivia,"" Mom's voice echoed in my sleep.



I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""



""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""



""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.



""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.



I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.



""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""



""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""



I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.



The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.



Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

That was before everything fell apart.



My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.



But everything changed the night of the setup.



I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.



Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.



Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.



What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.



I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.



""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but… we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""



I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.



""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.



""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.



Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.



""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.



I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.



The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.



There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.



I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.



""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.



I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.



She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.



My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.



She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.



She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.



""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.



""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""



My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.



Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.



""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""



Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.



I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?



""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""



Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""



Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.



""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.



I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.



As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.



Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""



I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.



Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""



A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.



When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.



...

Olivia's POV



Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.



The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.



But that was before.



Before everything fell apart.



Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.



""Who cleaned my room yesterday?"" Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.



I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. ""I did.""



Lennox's expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.



""Then tell me, Omega,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, ""where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?""



I froze, my heart racing as Lennox's words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.



""I… I didn't see any necklace,"" I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.



Lennox's eyes narrowed. ""Don't lie to me, Omega,"" he growled, his tone laced with anger. ""The necklace didn't just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.""



""I'm not lying!"" I protested, panic creeping into my voice. ""I cleaned the room, but I didn't take anything. I swear!""



He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. ""You expect me to believe that?"" he snapped. ""You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.""



His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.



""I didn't take it,"" I repeated, my voice steadier this time. ""You can search me if you don't believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.""



Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.



I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers' pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.



Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.



""I can't find it, Olivia. It's gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?"" he asked in anger.



I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. ""I did not take it…""



""Lies!"" he angrily cut me off.





Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. ""This doesn't make sense,"" he muttered. ""You cleaned my room. You were the last one here."" His gaze hardened. ""Don't lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?""



When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.



""You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!"" he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.



Lennox's words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn't matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.



""Only two people came into this room yesterday,"" Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. ""You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?""



I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.



I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior's silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha's Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.



Who would dare enter Lennox's room and steal something so valuable?



No one.



No one except Anita.



But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn't say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I'd only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.



""I didn't take it,"" I said again.



Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. ""You think I'm stupid, don't you?""



I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn't. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn't matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.



""You know what, Olivia?"" Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. ""I'm done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn't turn up by the end of the day, I'll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.""



His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. ""I didn't take it,"" I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.



Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. ""I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,"" he growled.



I didn't need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.



Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn't believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.



""Here you are, Olivia,"" a guard said as he walked over to me. ""Levi is looking for you, and he doesn't seem happy.""



The guard's announcement made my heart sink in fear.



""Why? What happened?"" I asked, terrified.



Joshua, the guard, shook his head. ""I don't know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.""



Shit! What could it be this time?



...

Olivia's POV



""Start talking, Olivia… before I lose my patience,"" Levi demanded, his voice laced with anger.



I stood frozen, unable to form words as I struggled to process the accusation. Again. I was being accused of stealing—again.



""Olivia!"" His voice thundered through the room. ""Don't make me lose my patience! Where is the bundle of dollar notes I kept in my drawer? Speak, you thief!""



My eyes widened in shock. But Before I could respond, the door to Levi's room burst open, and Louis stormed in, seething with rage.



""Olivia, where is the money I kept in my drawer?"" Louis demanded.



I took a step back, my breath hitching as both Levi and Louis glared at me with fiery rage. My heart pounded in my chest—not out of guilt, but out of sheer disbelief. This wasn't happening. Not again.



""I didn't take anything,"" I managed to say, my voice trembling.



Levi scoffed, running a frustrated hand through his hair. ""Really? Then tell us who else could have taken it. Who else enters our room if not you?""



Louis folded his arms, his frown deepening. ""Don't play innocent, Olivia. Just return the money and save us all the drama.""



Tears gathered in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. At least not now.



Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced myself to speak. ""I didn't take your money,"" I repeated, louder this time, my voice shaking with suppressed emotion. ""I would never steal from any of you.""



""Liar!""



I flinched at the new voice and turned to see Lennox standing at the doorway. His eyes, filled with cold hatred, locked onto mine.



""The necklace I bought for Anita is missing too,"" he announced, turning to his brothers.



All three of them—Levi, Louis, and Lennox—looked at me as if I were the worst kind of filth.



Levi was the first to walk toward me, and out of panic, I tried to run away, but it was useless. I was surrounded by the triplets.



Levi pinned me against the wall, lifting my hands above my head while his burning glare was staring right into my eyes.



""This is your last chance to confess and return what you stole, or you'll be dealt with accordingly,"" he threatened.



A tear slid down my cheek as I met his angry gaze. I knew, regardless of what I said, they would never believe that I didn't steal from them. They would never believe that their precious Anita was the one stealing from them.



""One… two…"" Levi began counting, and all I could do was shed more tears.



I sobbed silently, knowing the punishment for stealing in this household was brutal. Some thieves were thrown into the dungeons, like my father. Others had their hands chopped off. Some faced even worse fates.



As Levi counted, my mind raced. Would I end up like my father, rotting in a dungeon? Or worse?



""Ten.""



He released my wrists and took a step back.



""She's just like her father—a stubborn thief,"" Lennox sneered. More tears slipped down my cheeks.



""Guards! Bring some maids!"" Louis ordered sharply.



As we waited for the arrival of the maids, my heart raced in my chest. What were these men going to do to me? Why were they sending for maids?



My gaze met Lennox's, and he glared at me with so much hate, which made me wonder—did he really hate me just because my father was accused of stealing? Was this all about it, or was there something else involved? How could a man who once cherished me now look at me with such disgust?



Three maids walked in and bowed their heads to the triplets.



Levi was the one to usher the punishment. ""Take her to the mansion rooftop. Strip her and apply pepper to her naked body. Make sure she kneels under the sun.""



A tear slid down my cheek, but I didn't say a word. Compared to what was done to anyone accused of stealing, this was a lesser punishment for me.



""Take her away,"" Lennox demanded coldly.



The maids took hold of my arms and led me out of the room. I didn't struggle. There was no point. As we walked through the mansion, I saw my mother. She was sobbing, her entire body trembling, but she didn't dare approach me. If she did, she'd share my punishment.



When we reached the rooftop, the maids let go of me.



""Please undress,"" one of them urged softly.



I hesitated, my entire body trembling, but there was no escape. Swallowing hard, I began removing my clothes, my tears falling freely.



One of the maids picked up a bowl of ground pepper and moved closer. My body tensed.



The moment the first handful of pepper touched my skin, an agonized scream tore from my lips. My body convulsed as the fiery sting spread across my skin. They rubbed it everywhere—every inch of my exposed flesh except for my face. The burning sensation was unbearable. My knees buckled, but I forced myself to stay upright.



""You have to kneel,"" one of the maids said.



I hesitated, but my body was already giving in. Slowly, I sank to my knees, my sobs wracking my entire being. The scorching sun hit down on me, intensifying the torment. My entire body felt like it was on fire.



How could anyone be so cruel?



I wanted to scream, to beg for the pain to stop, but I knew it would only make things worse.



It was as if the sun was against me because it began to heat even more. My whole body was burning with pain, and it felt like I would pass out soon. The pain was unbearable. I had never imagined I would go through such torture.



With tear-filled eyes, I looked at the maids who stood in a corner, staring at me with pity. Painful tears trickled down my cheeks while my entire body burned. As the excruciating pain enveloped me, my vision blurred, and my head spun.



Painful memories flashed through my mind. The triplets used to adore me. They used to fight over who got to spend more time with me. They used to playfully argue about which one of them would marry me when we grew up.



How did everything change so drastically?



How did men who once cherished me suddenly hate me so much?



I wished my father hadn't been framed. I wished he had been proven innocent. Then, maybe… maybe, the triplets wouldn't hate me this much.



The fiery sting of the pepper intensified, searing every inch of my exposed skin. I struggled to remain upright, my knees weakening beneath me. With each agonizing breath, the world seemed to tilt and sway until, finally, I could no longer fight the overwhelming sensation of nausea and torment.



My body gave way, and I crumpled to the ground. Distant voices called my name, but I was already slipping into darkness, into the past. Into the days when the triplets swore they'd protect me. Back when they fought over who would marry me, not who would break me. But those boys were gone. And so was I.



...

Lennox's POV



An uncomfortable silence hung in the air as neither my brothers nor I spoke. The tension was thick, almost suffocating. An uneasy feeling settled in my chest as my thoughts drifted to Olivia—to the pain she might be going through. A part of me wanted to stop the punishment, to let it go. But if I did, it would show weakness, a soft spot for her. And I didn't want that. I couldn't afford that. Not after what she did to me.



""I wonder what she plans to do with all the things she stole,"" Levi spat, his voice sharp with anger, breaking the silence.



I turned to look at him, noticing the anger in his eyes. He was just as pissed as I was.



""Maybe she has a boyfriend she plans to give them to,"" Louis grunted.



The mere thought of that sent a sharp, uncomfortable pain through my chest, but I shoved it down and stood abruptly. ""Tell the guards to search her things. Perhaps they're still in her room.""



Without waiting for a response, I left the room, heading back to mine.



The mess I had created in my earlier frustration still littered in my room—broken glass, overturned furniture, scattered papers. I ignored it and walked straight to the minibar, grabbing a bottle of whiskey. Uncorking it, I took a long swig, feeling the burn slide down my throat.



With a sigh, I sank onto the bed, but no matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept drifting back to Olivia. The punishment she was enduring on the rooftop. I glanced at the window—the sun was scorching.



""If you're so worried about her, then stop the punishment."" My wolf's voice rumbled in my head.



I clenched my jaw. ""Why should I? Did she think about how I felt years ago when she hurt me? When she said those things?""



The door to my room pushed open, and Anita stepped inside. Her brows furrowed as she took in the mess in my room before her gaze landed on the whiskey bottle in my hand.



""Lennox, are you drinking because of the missing necklace?"" she asked, concern lacing her voice.



I swallowed hard. No. The necklace wasn't why I was drowning myself in whiskey. It was Olivia. But I couldn't say that to Anita.



""Yes. It was a gift for you,"" I murmured instead.



Anita sighed and walked closer, kneeling before me. Gently, she took the bottle from my hand and placed it aside before looking directly into my eyes.



""You don't have to do this to yourself over a necklace. You can always get me another one, right?"" she said, her voice soft, comforting.



And she was right. Money wasn't the issue. My brothers and I were the sons of the richest Alpha in the world and soon to be Alphas. A stolen diamond necklace shouldn't be enough to put me in this mood.



""Or…"" Anita tilted her head, her gaze searching mine. ""Is there something else bothering you?"" Anita asked, raising a suspicious brow.



I quickly shook my head.



She studied me for a moment before a slow smirk curled her lips. ""I know exactly what you need.""



Before I could ask what she meant, she reached for the hem of her dress and pulled it over her head, letting the fabric fall to the floor. My gaze traveled over her exposed skin, the smooth curves of her body.



""Come on,"" she whispered, her voice sultry. ""Let me help you take out your frustration.""



I said nothing as she unclasped her bra, letting it slide off her shoulders. Then, she moved closer, pressing her body against mine. Her hands traced down my chest, her fingers slowly unbuttoning my shirt before pushing it off.



""Use me, Lennox,"" she breathed, tilting her head up to meet my gaze. ""Pour all your anger into me. Take what you need.""



A dark hunger stirred inside me—the need to lose myself, to forget everything—even if just for a moment. I grabbed the back of her neck, pulling her into a bruising kiss. She gasped against my lips, but I didn't slow down. I pushed her back onto the bed, climbing over her, my body pressing her into the mattress. I ran hungry and angry kisses all over her body before pulling away and standing before her.



Anita lay back on the bed, her legs spread, her body on full display for me. Her smirk was teasing, her eyes dark with anticipation. She knew what I wanted—what I needed—and she was more than willing to give it to me.



I didn't waste time. My belt hit the floor with a sharp clink, and I shoved my pants down, my cock already hard and aching. I crawled onto the bed, grabbing Anita's ankles and yanking her closer, making her gasp in surprise.



""So rough, so dominant,"" she purred, but I wasn't in the mood for her teasing.



I wrapped my fingers around her throat, squeezing just enough to make her gasp. ""Shut up,"" I growled, watching her eyes widen with excitement.



Her lips parted, her breath hitching as I tightened my grip just a little more. ""Yes, Master,"" she whispered.



That sent a dark thrill through me. I released her throat and grabbed her hips, flipping her onto her stomach in one swift motion. She barely had time to brace herself before I yanked her up onto her knees, positioning her exactly how I wanted.



I ran a hand down her spine, feeling her shiver under my touch. ""You're wet already,"" I noted darkly, dragging my fingers through her slick folds.



She whimpered, pressing back against me, silently begging for more.



But I wasn't feeling generous tonight.



I grabbed a fistful of her hair, yanking her head back as I aligned myself with her entrance. ""Beg for it,"" I commanded.



She moaned, her fingers gripping the sheets. ""Please, Master,"" she gasped. ""I need you.""



That was all I needed.



With one hard thrust, I slammed into her, making her cry out. I didn't give her time to adjust—I didn't want to. I set a brutal pace from the start, pounding into her relentlessly. The bed frame creaked beneath us, the sound of skin slapping against skin filling the room.



Anita moaned loudly, her body rocking forward with every thrust, but I pulled her back against me, keeping her exactly where I wanted. My grip on her hips was bruising, my nails digging into her flesh as I took her hard and rough, just the way I needed.



""Who do you belong to?"" I growled, yanking her head back again.



""You, Lennox,"" she panted, her voice breaking with pleasure. ""Only you.""



I smirked darkly. ""Damn right.""



I released her hair and pressed her chest down onto the mattress, driving deeper into her. My control was slipping, my wolf growling as I fucked her like an animal.



She was screaming now, her body shuddering beneath me, but I didn't stop. I couldn't stop. Not until I had taken everything I wanted from her.



And I wasn't done yet.



Anita's body trembled beneath me, her moans filling the room as I drove into her relentlessly. But no matter how hard I took her, no matter how much she screamed my name, it wasn't enough.



Because it wasn't her.



I clenched my jaw, trying to push the thought away, but it was useless. My mind betrayed me, painting a different picture. It wasn't Anita's dark hair spilling over her shoulders—it was Olivia's. It wasn't Anita's moans filling my ears—it was Olivia's breathless whimpers, the way I knew she'd sound if I ever had her like this.



""Lennox…"" Anita gasped, her voice breaking with pleasure as she arched her back, pressing against me. But for a moment, I didn't hear Anita. I heard Olivia.



A violent need surged through me. I pulled out of her suddenly, making her whimper at the loss. Before she could protest, I flipped onto my back and grabbed her by the waist, pulling her over me.



""Ride me,"" I ordered, my voice rough with need.



Anita grinned, straddling me eagerly. She reached down, positioning herself before sinking onto my cock with a moan. Her head fell back, her nails digging into my chest as she took me deep.



I gritted my teeth, my hands gripping her hips tightly as she began to move. But I wasn't watching Anita anymore.



I was watching Olivia.



In my mind, it was her above me, her red lips parted in breathless pleasure. It was her soft skin beneath my hands, her tight pussy wrapped around me.



""Fuck,"" I growled, my grip tightening. I drove my hips up hard, making Anita cry out. But all I saw was Olivia.



How would she look like this? Would she be shy? Would she try to fight the pleasure, or would she surrender to it completely?



I imagined her whimpering my name, her nails dragging down my chest as she came apart for me.



A low, possessive growl rumbled from my chest. Olivia wasn't supposed to be in my head like this. She wasn't supposed to be the one I craved. I hated her. She had hurt me, but I couldn't stop thinking about her.



And no matter how hard I tried, no matter how many times I fucked Anita or anyone else, no one could take her place.



Anita's pace quickened, her nails scraping against my chest as she rode me harder, chasing her release. My grip on her hips was firm, guiding her movements, but my mind was elsewhere.



Not here. Not with her.



With Olivia.



I could almost see her—imagine the way her body would tremble above me, the way her lips would part in a gasp as she took me deep. My control slipped at the thought, my grip tightening as I thrust up into Anita with brutal force.



""Lennox—"" Anita gasped, her body tensing. She was close.



I was too.



With one last punishing thrust, I sent her over the edge. Her body clenched around me as she cried out, shuddering in pleasure. The sensation pushed me past my limit, and with a low growl, I let go.



Pleasure ripped through me, my release spilling into the condom as I buried myself deep inside her. My breathing was heavy, my chest rising and falling as I rode out the aftershocks.



For a brief moment, silence filled the room, broken only by Anita's soft panting.



Then, without a word, I reached down and pulled out of her. My body was still humming with satisfaction, but the moment was already fading.



Because it wasn't Olivia.



It never was.



Anita stretched beside me, her fingers lazily trailing down my chest. ""Damn, that was hot,"" she breathed.



I didn't respond. Instead, I reached over and pulled her into my arms. For a moment, we didn't say a word until the door opened and Levi and Louis walked in.



""So you two were having fun without us,"" Louis said, and Anita, loving the attention, giggled softly.



""Move away, Lennox,"" Levi grumbled.



I sighed and rolled out of bed as Levi and Louis positioned themselves beside Anita, wasting no time before devouring her like hungry animals.



I moved away from the bed, walking into the bathroom and turning on the shower. As I stood under the cold water, I could still hear the muffled moans coming from my room.



My brothers and I did practically everything together. We shared everything—so sharing Anita, or any other woman, was nothing new. But we also competed against each other.



Who was the best fighter.

The strongest wolf.

The fastest shifter.



Sometimes, it even came down to who fucked better. Who Anita enjoyed more.



And most importantly—who would end up being her mate.



We all knew that on her eighteenth birthday, she would be mated to one of us. And if fate was cruel enough, to all three of us.



And whoever she was mated to would be Dad's favorite. The pack's favored Alpha.



So, in a way, we were all competing for her.



But that didn't mean we didn't love each other.



Sighing heavily, I thought of Olivia, of the good memories I had of her. Of how I fell in love with her even as just a little boy of twelve. How I competed with my brothers, assuming they liked her too.



As we grew older, I thought she liked me too.



But I was wrong. So damn wrong.



Turning off the shower, I tied a towel around my waist and walked back into the room.



Back in my room, I found Levi and Louis fucking Anita dominantly. She was on her knees, Levi's cock in her mouth while Louis fucked her from behind.



Their moans filled the air, but I ignored them, walking over to grab a pair of simple track pants. I needed a run. I needed to clear my head.



I pulled them on and left the room without another word.



But just as I stepped into the hallway, a female servant rushed up to me, looking panicked.



""Young master, Olivia just fainted on the rooftop,"" she announced, her voice trembling.



My breath caught. Panic surged through me, but I forced myself to stay composed.



""Then wake her up and send her back in,"" I said, sounding nonchalant as I hid my worry.



""That's the problem,"" the servant insisted.

""We've tried waking her, but she's not responding.""



I furrowed my brow, my frown deepening. ""What do you mean?""



She swallowed hard, her eyes wide with fear. ""She's not breathing.""",1,1750260475.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

People suggested it was because of lane drifting.

With that in mind, I did some testing.  Indeed, if you drift back and forth in your lane or stray over the lines, you can get the warning to trigger.  So it does appear to be based off lane sensing (and not, say, some internal camera or sensor that measures whether your eyes or closed or your head is nodding).

With that in mind, I now realize that I was getting this warning in an area of construction near my house where drivers are forced to leave the lane in a few different spots.  So that makes more sense.

I just want like one friend. One guy I can hang out with. 

I live a pretty secluded life. I'm the weirdo in my college, the guy who doesn't talk a lot, doesn't fit in the room, only comes to class and then goes home. I have two friends - My girlfriend and my best friend from school. 

And it's my fault, I don't put myself out there and I don't mix with most people. But I can't ever do much about it. 

My girlfriend is great company, but she's not outdoorsy like me. My best friend was outdoorsy and we did a lot of crazy shit together, but he's got other stuff in life to handle and most days I'm the one calling to hangout. 

I just wanted one person I could rely on you know? Like one guy who'd go for hikes with me, who'd step out for a drink or watch a movie with me. I really need that. I keep myself occupied most of the time with my books and games and bikes. But I have no one to share my life with sometimes. I don't want to take my girlfriend on a walk only to hear complaints (when I said not outdoorsy I meant she's the ""It's too hot/wet/exhausting"" for a walk type) or to call up a friend who won't pick up. 

I wonder sometimes if this is how I'll be for the rest of my life. Just someone who either chooses to be alone half the time and suffers loneliness the other half.

Olivia's POV



""Wake up, Olivia,"" Mom's voice echoed in my sleep.



I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""



""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""



""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.



""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.



I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.



""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""



""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""



I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.



The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.



Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

That was before everything fell apart.



My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.



But everything changed the night of the setup.



I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.



Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.



Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.



What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.



I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.



""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but… we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""



I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.



""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.



""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.



Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.



""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.



I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.



The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.



There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.



I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.



""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.



I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.



She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.



My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.



She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.



She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.



""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.



""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""



My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.



Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.



""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""



Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.



I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?



""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""



Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""



Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.



""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.



I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.



As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.



Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""



I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.



Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""



A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.



When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.



...

Olivia's POV



Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.



The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.



But that was before.



Before everything fell apart.



Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.



""Who cleaned my room yesterday?"" Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.



I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. ""I did.""



Lennox's expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.



""Then tell me, Omega,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, ""where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?""



I froze, my heart racing as Lennox's words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.



""I… I didn't see any necklace,"" I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.



Lennox's eyes narrowed. ""Don't lie to me, Omega,"" he growled, his tone laced with anger. ""The necklace didn't just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.""



""I'm not lying!"" I protested, panic creeping into my voice. ""I cleaned the room, but I didn't take anything. I swear!""



He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. ""You expect me to believe that?"" he snapped. ""You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.""



His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.



""I didn't take it,"" I repeated, my voice steadier this time. ""You can search me if you don't believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.""



Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.



I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers' pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.



Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.



""I can't find it, Olivia. It's gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?"" he asked in anger.



I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. ""I did not take it…""



""Lies!"" he angrily cut me off.





Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. ""This doesn't make sense,"" he muttered. ""You cleaned my room. You were the last one here."" His gaze hardened. ""Don't lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?""



When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.



""You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!"" he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.



Lennox's words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn't matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.



""Only two people came into this room yesterday,"" Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. ""You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?""



I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.



I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior's silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha's Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.



Who would dare enter Lennox's room and steal something so valuable?



No one.



No one except Anita.



But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn't say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I'd only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.



""I didn't take it,"" I said again.



Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. ""You think I'm stupid, don't you?""



I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn't. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn't matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.



""You know what, Olivia?"" Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. ""I'm done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn't turn up by the end of the day, I'll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.""



His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. ""I didn't take it,"" I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.



Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. ""I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,"" he growled.



I didn't need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.



Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn't believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.



""Here you are, Olivia,"" a guard said as he walked over to me. ""Levi is looking for you, and he doesn't seem happy.""



The guard's announcement made my heart sink in fear.



""Why? What happened?"" I asked, terrified.



Joshua, the guard, shook his head. ""I don't know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.""



Shit! What could it be this time?



...

Olivia's POV



""Start talking, Olivia… before I lose my patience,"" Levi demanded, his voice laced with anger.



I stood frozen, unable to form words as I struggled to process the accusation. Again. I was being accused of stealing—again.



""Olivia!"" His voice thundered through the room. ""Don't make me lose my patience! Where is the bundle of dollar notes I kept in my drawer? Speak, you thief!""



My eyes widened in shock. But Before I could respond, the door to Levi's room burst open, and Louis stormed in, seething with rage.



""Olivia, where is the money I kept in my drawer?"" Louis demanded.



I took a step back, my breath hitching as both Levi and Louis glared at me with fiery rage. My heart pounded in my chest—not out of guilt, but out of sheer disbelief. This wasn't happening. Not again.



""I didn't take anything,"" I managed to say, my voice trembling.



Levi scoffed, running a frustrated hand through his hair. ""Really? Then tell us who else could have taken it. Who else enters our room if not you?""



Louis folded his arms, his frown deepening. ""Don't play innocent, Olivia. Just return the money and save us all the drama.""



Tears gathered in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. At least not now.



Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced myself to speak. ""I didn't take your money,"" I repeated, louder this time, my voice shaking with suppressed emotion. ""I would never steal from any of you.""



""Liar!""



I flinched at the new voice and turned to see Lennox standing at the doorway. His eyes, filled with cold hatred, locked onto mine.



""The necklace I bought for Anita is missing too,"" he announced, turning to his brothers.



All three of them—Levi, Louis, and Lennox—looked at me as if I were the worst kind of filth.



Levi was the first to walk toward me, and out of panic, I tried to run away, but it was useless. I was surrounded by the triplets.



Levi pinned me against the wall, lifting my hands above my head while his burning glare was staring right into my eyes.



""This is your last chance to confess and return what you stole, or you'll be dealt with accordingly,"" he threatened.



A tear slid down my cheek as I met his angry gaze. I knew, regardless of what I said, they would never believe that I didn't steal from them. They would never believe that their precious Anita was the one stealing from them.



""One… two…"" Levi began counting, and all I could do was shed more tears.



I sobbed silently, knowing the punishment for stealing in this household was brutal. Some thieves were thrown into the dungeons, like my father. Others had their hands chopped off. Some faced even worse fates.



As Levi counted, my mind raced. Would I end up like my father, rotting in a dungeon? Or worse?



""Ten.""



He released my wrists and took a step back.



""She's just like her father—a stubborn thief,"" Lennox sneered. More tears slipped down my cheeks.



""Guards! Bring some maids!"" Louis ordered sharply.



As we waited for the arrival of the maids, my heart raced in my chest. What were these men going to do to me? Why were they sending for maids?



My gaze met Lennox's, and he glared at me with so much hate, which made me wonder—did he really hate me just because my father was accused of stealing? Was this all about it, or was there something else involved? How could a man who once cherished me now look at me with such disgust?



Three maids walked in and bowed their heads to the triplets.



Levi was the one to usher the punishment. ""Take her to the mansion rooftop. Strip her and apply pepper to her naked body. Make sure she kneels under the sun.""



A tear slid down my cheek, but I didn't say a word. Compared to what was done to anyone accused of stealing, this was a lesser punishment for me.



""Take her away,"" Lennox demanded coldly.



The maids took hold of my arms and led me out of the room. I didn't struggle. There was no point. As we walked through the mansion, I saw my mother. She was sobbing, her entire body trembling, but she didn't dare approach me. If she did, she'd share my punishment.



When we reached the rooftop, the maids let go of me.



""Please undress,"" one of them urged softly.



I hesitated, my entire body trembling, but there was no escape. Swallowing hard, I began removing my clothes, my tears falling freely.



One of the maids picked up a bowl of ground pepper and moved closer. My body tensed.



The moment the first handful of pepper touched my skin, an agonized scream tore from my lips. My body convulsed as the fiery sting spread across my skin. They rubbed it everywhere—every inch of my exposed flesh except for my face. The burning sensation was unbearable. My knees buckled, but I forced myself to stay upright.



""You have to kneel,"" one of the maids said.



I hesitated, but my body was already giving in. Slowly, I sank to my knees, my sobs wracking my entire being. The scorching sun hit down on me, intensifying the torment. My entire body felt like it was on fire.



How could anyone be so cruel?



I wanted to scream, to beg for the pain to stop, but I knew it would only make things worse.



It was as if the sun was against me because it began to heat even more. My whole body was burning with pain, and it felt like I would pass out soon. The pain was unbearable. I had never imagined I would go through such torture.



With tear-filled eyes, I looked at the maids who stood in a corner, staring at me with pity. Painful tears trickled down my cheeks while my entire body burned. As the excruciating pain enveloped me, my vision blurred, and my head spun.



Painful memories flashed through my mind. The triplets used to adore me. They used to fight over who got to spend more time with me. They used to playfully argue about which one of them would marry me when we grew up.



How did everything change so drastically?



How did men who once cherished me suddenly hate me so much?



I wished my father hadn't been framed. I wished he had been proven innocent. Then, maybe… maybe, the triplets wouldn't hate me this much.



The fiery sting of the pepper intensified, searing every inch of my exposed skin. I struggled to remain upright, my knees weakening beneath me. With each agonizing breath, the world seemed to tilt and sway until, finally, I could no longer fight the overwhelming sensation of nausea and torment.



My body gave way, and I crumpled to the ground. Distant voices called my name, but I was already slipping into darkness, into the past. Into the days when the triplets swore they'd protect me. Back when they fought over who would marry me, not who would break me. But those boys were gone. And so was I.



...

Lennox's POV



An uncomfortable silence hung in the air as neither my brothers nor I spoke. The tension was thick, almost suffocating. An uneasy feeling settled in my chest as my thoughts drifted to Olivia—to the pain she might be going through. A part of me wanted to stop the punishment, to let it go. But if I did, it would show weakness, a soft spot for her. And I didn't want that. I couldn't afford that. Not after what she did to me.



""I wonder what she plans to do with all the things she stole,"" Levi spat, his voice sharp with anger, breaking the silence.



I turned to look at him, noticing the anger in his eyes. He was just as pissed as I was.



""Maybe she has a boyfriend she plans to give them to,"" Louis grunted.



The mere thought of that sent a sharp, uncomfortable pain through my chest, but I shoved it down and stood abruptly. ""Tell the guards to search her things. Perhaps they're still in her room.""



Without waiting for a response, I left the room, heading back to mine.



The mess I had created in my earlier frustration still littered in my room—broken glass, overturned furniture, scattered papers. I ignored it and walked straight to the minibar, grabbing a bottle of whiskey. Uncorking it, I took a long swig, feeling the burn slide down my throat.



With a sigh, I sank onto the bed, but no matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept drifting back to Olivia. The punishment she was enduring on the rooftop. I glanced at the window—the sun was scorching.



""If you're so worried about her, then stop the punishment."" My wolf's voice rumbled in my head.



I clenched my jaw. ""Why should I? Did she think about how I felt years ago when she hurt me? When she said those things?""



The door to my room pushed open, and Anita stepped inside. Her brows furrowed as she took in the mess in my room before her gaze landed on the whiskey bottle in my hand.



""Lennox, are you drinking because of the missing necklace?"" she asked, concern lacing her voice.



I swallowed hard. No. The necklace wasn't why I was drowning myself in whiskey. It was Olivia. But I couldn't say that to Anita.



""Yes. It was a gift for you,"" I murmured instead.



Anita sighed and walked closer, kneeling before me. Gently, she took the bottle from my hand and placed it aside before looking directly into my eyes.



""You don't have to do this to yourself over a necklace. You can always get me another one, right?"" she said, her voice soft, comforting.



And she was right. Money wasn't the issue. My brothers and I were the sons of the richest Alpha in the world and soon to be Alphas. A stolen diamond necklace shouldn't be enough to put me in this mood.



""Or…"" Anita tilted her head, her gaze searching mine. ""Is there something else bothering you?"" Anita asked, raising a suspicious brow.



I quickly shook my head.



She studied me for a moment before a slow smirk curled her lips. ""I know exactly what you need.""



Before I could ask what she meant, she reached for the hem of her dress and pulled it over her head, letting the fabric fall to the floor. My gaze traveled over her exposed skin, the smooth curves of her body.



""Come on,"" she whispered, her voice sultry. ""Let me help you take out your frustration.""



I said nothing as she unclasped her bra, letting it slide off her shoulders. Then, she moved closer, pressing her body against mine. Her hands traced down my chest, her fingers slowly unbuttoning my shirt before pushing it off.



""Use me, Lennox,"" she breathed, tilting her head up to meet my gaze. ""Pour all your anger into me. Take what you need.""



A dark hunger stirred inside me—the need to lose myself, to forget everything—even if just for a moment. I grabbed the back of her neck, pulling her into a bruising kiss. She gasped against my lips, but I didn't slow down. I pushed her back onto the bed, climbing over her, my body pressing her into the mattress. I ran hungry and angry kisses all over her body before pulling away and standing before her.



Anita lay back on the bed, her legs spread, her body on full display for me. Her smirk was teasing, her eyes dark with anticipation. She knew what I wanted—what I needed—and she was more than willing to give it to me.



I didn't waste time. My belt hit the floor with a sharp clink, and I shoved my pants down, my cock already hard and aching. I crawled onto the bed, grabbing Anita's ankles and yanking her closer, making her gasp in surprise.



""So rough, so dominant,"" she purred, but I wasn't in the mood for her teasing.



I wrapped my fingers around her throat, squeezing just enough to make her gasp. ""Shut up,"" I growled, watching her eyes widen with excitement.



Her lips parted, her breath hitching as I tightened my grip just a little more. ""Yes, Master,"" she whispered.



That sent a dark thrill through me. I released her throat and grabbed her hips, flipping her onto her stomach in one swift motion. She barely had time to brace herself before I yanked her up onto her knees, positioning her exactly how I wanted.



I ran a hand down her spine, feeling her shiver under my touch. ""You're wet already,"" I noted darkly, dragging my fingers through her slick folds.



She whimpered, pressing back against me, silently begging for more.



But I wasn't feeling generous tonight.



I grabbed a fistful of her hair, yanking her head back as I aligned myself with her entrance. ""Beg for it,"" I commanded.



She moaned, her fingers gripping the sheets. ""Please, Master,"" she gasped. ""I need you.""



That was all I needed.



With one hard thrust, I slammed into her, making her cry out. I didn't give her time to adjust—I didn't want to. I set a brutal pace from the start, pounding into her relentlessly. The bed frame creaked beneath us, the sound of skin slapping against skin filling the room.



Anita moaned loudly, her body rocking forward with every thrust, but I pulled her back against me, keeping her exactly where I wanted. My grip on her hips was bruising, my nails digging into her flesh as I took her hard and rough, just the way I needed.



""Who do you belong to?"" I growled, yanking her head back again.



""You, Lennox,"" she panted, her voice breaking with pleasure. ""Only you.""



I smirked darkly. ""Damn right.""



I released her hair and pressed her chest down onto the mattress, driving deeper into her. My control was slipping, my wolf growling as I fucked her like an animal.



She was screaming now, her body shuddering beneath me, but I didn't stop. I couldn't stop. Not until I had taken everything I wanted from her.



And I wasn't done yet.



Anita's body trembled beneath me, her moans filling the room as I drove into her relentlessly. But no matter how hard I took her, no matter how much she screamed my name, it wasn't enough.



Because it wasn't her.



I clenched my jaw, trying to push the thought away, but it was useless. My mind betrayed me, painting a different picture. It wasn't Anita's dark hair spilling over her shoulders—it was Olivia's. It wasn't Anita's moans filling my ears—it was Olivia's breathless whimpers, the way I knew she'd sound if I ever had her like this.



""Lennox…"" Anita gasped, her voice breaking with pleasure as she arched her back, pressing against me. But for a moment, I didn't hear Anita. I heard Olivia.



A violent need surged through me. I pulled out of her suddenly, making her whimper at the loss. Before she could protest, I flipped onto my back and grabbed her by the waist, pulling her over me.



""Ride me,"" I ordered, my voice rough with need.



Anita grinned, straddling me eagerly. She reached down, positioning herself before sinking onto my cock with a moan. Her head fell back, her nails digging into my chest as she took me deep.



I gritted my teeth, my hands gripping her hips tightly as she began to move. But I wasn't watching Anita anymore.



I was watching Olivia.



In my mind, it was her above me, her red lips parted in breathless pleasure. It was her soft skin beneath my hands, her tight pussy wrapped around me.



""Fuck,"" I growled, my grip tightening. I drove my hips up hard, making Anita cry out. But all I saw was Olivia.



How would she look like this? Would she be shy? Would she try to fight the pleasure, or would she surrender to it completely?



I imagined her whimpering my name, her nails dragging down my chest as she came apart for me.



A low, possessive growl rumbled from my chest. Olivia wasn't supposed to be in my head like this. She wasn't supposed to be the one I craved. I hated her. She had hurt me, but I couldn't stop thinking about her.



And no matter how hard I tried, no matter how many times I fucked Anita or anyone else, no one could take her place.



Anita's pace quickened, her nails scraping against my chest as she rode me harder, chasing her release. My grip on her hips was firm, guiding her movements, but my mind was elsewhere.



Not here. Not with her.



With Olivia.



I could almost see her—imagine the way her body would tremble above me, the way her lips would part in a gasp as she took me deep. My control slipped at the thought, my grip tightening as I thrust up into Anita with brutal force.



""Lennox—"" Anita gasped, her body tensing. She was close.



I was too.



With one last punishing thrust, I sent her over the edge. Her body clenched around me as she cried out, shuddering in pleasure. The sensation pushed me past my limit, and with a low growl, I let go.



Pleasure ripped through me, my release spilling into the condom as I buried myself deep inside her. My breathing was heavy, my chest rising and falling as I rode out the aftershocks.



For a brief moment, silence filled the room, broken only by Anita's soft panting.



Then, without a word, I reached down and pulled out of her. My body was still humming with satisfaction, but the moment was already fading.



Because it wasn't Olivia.



It never was.



Anita stretched beside me, her fingers lazily trailing down my chest. ""Damn, that was hot,"" she breathed.



I didn't respond. Instead, I reached over and pulled her into my arms. For a moment, we didn't say a word until the door opened and Levi and Louis walked in.



""So you two were having fun without us,"" Louis said, and Anita, loving the attention, giggled softly.



""Move away, Lennox,"" Levi grumbled.



I sighed and rolled out of bed as Levi and Louis positioned themselves beside Anita, wasting no time before devouring her like hungry animals.



I moved away from the bed, walking into the bathroom and turning on the shower. As I stood under the cold water, I could still hear the muffled moans coming from my room.



My brothers and I did practically everything together. We shared everything—so sharing Anita, or any other woman, was nothing new. But we also competed against each other.

Now, I'm American and Snape's from the UK so I ultimately understand he may prefer tea first and foremost. In which case I believe he'd be a plain black tea kinda guy.

But I just wanted to share my two cents on his coffee. So first of all he DEF makes coffee at home. He probably has is own French press and I can see him preferring a dark roast as it's more robust and bitter flavor. However I'd argue he'd be cheating himself of caffeine since darker roasts have less caffeine the medium or blonde roasts. He also doesn't add cream or sugar.
I'd like to think if he'd want to venture into the muggle world, he'd also order a plain coffee, but if he were to change up his order, he'd opt for something like a flat white or cortado. Still strong and coffee forward, but with a little extra something.  I also head canon he tips well, especially if the barista is female.

I also believe if he were to go to a muggle cafe, and they were to ask his name, he'd have a set alias to give them. Much like celebrities do when they go to places like Starbucks and whatnot.

Hey everyone! 

A few months ago, we set up a coffee club to meet and make new friends over a low-key coffee because hey, this stuff is hard right? It's been a good little success so here's a timely repost for anyone new to Baltimore or interested in joining in to see out the summer! Some FAQs:

**When/Where do we meet?**

Sundays at 11:00 - 13:00 at Kitsch in R House! Come along any time between then.

**What's the demographic?**

All walks of life! All ages are welcome; generally people aged 25-40 attend.

**Do you have a social media page?**

Yep! We're on Instagram at [bmorecoffclub ](http://instagram.com/bmorecoffclub)and there's a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/share/g/1ZDnXydGfS/). We also now have a [Discord page ](https://discord.gg/dZpCs597)if you prefer. I'll admit I kinda suck at keeping up social media so bare with me! 

**How about parking?**

Free parking in their car parks or on the street, bike lock access, public transport. Nice and easy!

**What does it cost?**

It's free, but you might want to factor in the cost of a cup of coffee or alternative.

  
See y'all there!

1lejok8,https://www.reddit.com/r/davidlynch/comments/1lejok8/new_lynch_fan_wanted_to_share_my_experiences/,"New Lynch fan, wanted to share my experiences.","I am a new Lynch fan. I decided to watch Twin Peaks shortly after he moved to the other place. I absolutely loved it, I binged the whole thing, taking breaks to listen to Laura's Secret Diary and to read Cooper's biography. 

Then I watched Fire Walk with Me. I was crying so much at that ending, I felt like I was right there with Laura in the Black Lodge. It was a horrible, beautiful amazing movie experience.

Then The Return. Didn't love it in the moment but after every episode I felt I had a greater understanding. When it was all finished I was left changed and hungry for me.

It was after watching Blue Velvet that I released something. The way Lynch presents his stories and worlds speaks to me deeply. Jeffery in Blue Velvet goes through a lot of similar emotions I've had about sex and relationships in the past. The scene where he cries after hitting Dorothy hit especially hard for me, a girlfriend of mine last year really wanted me to choke her during sex and it made me super uncomfortable whenever I convinced myself to do it. I related to not just the characters but the world the movie created, the music, the hidden underbelly of life.

This feeling of connection to David's work continued in Eraserhead. 
The idea of getting a woman pregnant is terrifying to me. It is one of the scariest things I think about and I often get really nervous when the topic comes up. The worst thing a girlfriend could say to me is ""I'm pregnant""

Eraserhead perfectly represented my fear on screen. I was shaking when it ended. A film has never made me shake before.

Thank you so much David Lynch. Thank you for creating these worlds that will exist in peoples lives for the rest of time ❤️. I feel his work has made me think about and understand how I see the world. 

I've picked up creative writing which is something I've wanted to do for a while. I want to complete a full story by the end of next month. I have been taking more photographs and recognising more when I have a damn fine glass of coke (not a coffee drinker lol) I've also been making my way through Crazy Clown Time and intended to watch Lost Highway or Mullholland Drive soon.

1lejm8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1lejm8l/it_finally_happened_i_brewed_the_best_cup_ive_had/,"It finally happened, I brewed the best cup I’ve had in my life","I’ve been doing pour over for a little over 9 months now and I have only really considered myself getting decent at it in the last 3. 

Today though, I brewed a cup and was blown away by it. 

The only thing I changed from what I was doing previously (with these beans) is the brew temp—it’s Summer Moon’s Sweet Hearth oak-roasted medium roast, and I, like a dumbass, was brewing at 205F with my Govee because the button says coffee on it. 

After a quick google I decided I’d try at a lower temp—I set the DIY button to 199–and lo and behold the cup was leagues better. 

This is why I got into coffee those months ago, for this moment. 

For reference, my equipment:

Govee smart kettle

A really cheap Amazon kitchen scale

Beans already mentioned, Summer Moon’s Sweet Hearth medium roast

Ceramic v60 with Hario white paper filters

Kingrinder K6, 140 clicks I believe 

Distilled water with Third Wave’s medium roast packets

Recipe: 260g water to 16-18g beans depending how Im feeling. (I’ve noticed with the Govee that I lose about 5-10 grams to kettle geometry so I compensate with 260.) 50g bloom, wait around a minute, pour the rest, wait ~30 secs after no standing water in the filter. Slow spiral pour from high, maybe 6-8 inches above the v60. Pouring the last 200g takes around 45 secs. ",12,1750259495.0,pourover,7,0.93,False

**Process:** Backers have just received their official referral codes. When shared (*which is explicitly encouraged by the company*), this code can be applied at checkout to reserve a spot in the very **next available batch** and receive a **$100 USD coffee credit** with one of Meticulous' partner coffee roasters once the full balance for the machine has been paid.

***\*Note:*** The initial checkout is only a $150 refundable deposit. This reserves a spot at the end of the line. The benefits mentioned above only kick in once the remaining balance has been paid.

***\*Note:*** Any non-backers who buy a machine will *not* be pushing out backers in a particular batch. Any machines that get 'bumped up' will be in addition to that batch, increasing the overall batch size.

**Benefits for Backers:** Backers whose referral code is used also get bumped up to the next available batch, and receive $150 USD (first 3 referrals) or $100 USD (referrals 4+) in the form of credit at the Meticulous store.

**Reasoning** **(by my understanding):** Meticulous needs to understand how much demand there is, outside of the people already backing, to then know how quickly to ramp up production (by number of units per batch).

Principia Discordia, page 5.

by Camden Benares, The Count of Five        Headmaster, Camp Meeker Cabal

A serious young man found the conflicts of mid 20th Century America confusing. He went to many people seeking a way of resolving within himself the discords that troubled him, but he remained troubled.

One night in a coffee house, a self-ordained Zen Master said to him, ""go to the dilapidated mansion you will find at this address which I have written down for you. Do not speak to those who live there; you must remain silent until the moon rises tomorrow night. Go to the large room on the right of the main hallway, sit in the lotus position on top of the rubble in the northeast corner, face the corner, and meditate.""

He did just as the Zen Master instructed. His meditation was frequently interrupted by worries. He worried whether or not the rest of the plumbing fixtures would fall from the second floor bathroom to join the pipes and other trash he was sitting on. He worried how would he know when the moon rose on the next night. He worried about what the people who walked through the room said about him.

His worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as if in a test of his faith, ordure (poop) fell from the second floor onto him. At that time two people walked into the room. The first asked the second who the man was sitting there was. The second replied ""Some say he is a holy man. Others say he is a shithead.""

Hearing this, the man was enlightened.",1,1750259245.0,chaosmagick,0,0.6,False

it’s hard to even just stand up and have a 
conversation for the first half of the day. 

for reference, before my injection, i lift heavy weights 3x a week, do calisthenics 3x a week, hit pilates 2x a week and usually do a brisk walk every day. 

SOOOOOO, im used to being very active, having a healthy amount of energy and eating obviously enough calories to sustain that lifestyle. ok slay. great. i know im gonna be in a deficit. that’s not a problem but im just shocked at my body’s reaction. 

im wondering how everyone is dealing with this fatigue from such low calories. 

also - should i just give up my lifestyle in order to lose the weight with this drug? i mean i can’t even possibly imagine going to the gym right now! i felt like i was going to faint in the shower! 

can’t drink coffee anymore or energy drinks apparently. which won’t even help anyway (i know cause i forced myself to drink one before pickle ball yesterday hahahaha) 

anyway. i’m feeling like i want to quit this drug and not continue even though i love how much it’s quieting my food noise and losing weight very fast. 

for anyone who is a macro nerd, here are my macros from the last two days: 

monday
calories 1,349
protein: 130g
carbs: 67 😩
fat: 57g
activity: heavy weight lifting leg day 

tuesday
calories: 1,190
protein: 140g
carbs: 79g
fat: 40g
activity: just pickle ball. didn’t have the mental energy to even try to do my calisthenics workout. 



can anyone be rational with me here? like, is it worth it? i know im going to get probably spit roasted on here because im not obese, but i have some health issues since october that have made it extremely hard for me to lose inflammation and fat no matter what my diet is. hence why i settled on trying sema. my cousin works for hers so i was pretty educated and it seemed like a safe and effective option for me. 

i dont know what to do but i do know that i dont want to feel like actual shit. 

i thought about adding those powdered carb supplements, but i know sema hates carbs. SO WHAT DO I DO?!? 

i take vyvanse every day for me adhd which normally gives me energy. but damn. this is crazy. HELP LOL. :( 

if you read this far i love you so much thank you! hahha.

The last three sessions I’ve been having panic somewhere after the second inhaler or third one. 

I honestly really don’t know why. I don’t have highly trippy sessions and also on paper Spravato shouldn’t be a very activating substance. About the only way to describe it is suddenly I feel like I’m strapped in on top of a rollercoaster about ready to launch. While it’s true I generally don’t like the “in a stupor” way it makes me feel, it’s not a life or death situation, and in fact is the opposite. Having your vitals checked often by health professionals in a dark quiet room while reclined. It should be relaxing.

I did check the archive and a few people have made posts like this but, still, it seems like a not very common side effect. I tend to have an emergency benzo on hand but am very reluctant to take it, and haven’t done so. The last bad session I had to stand up to pace, and obviously they would highly prefer you stay seated lol. The nurse was able to get me to count down with her which may have helped.

I honestly will listen to any advice. The only thing I think I could maybe do differently is cut out caffeine the morning of, which generally is just one cup of coffee at 7, with an appointment time of 11.

Deep breathing/meditation/similar doesn’t tend to work with me because it just gets overwritten by whatever the panic trigger is.

I saw the same issues when I dual booted a live ISO of Ubuntu 24.04 running Wayland.

Is there a plan for Cosmic to somehow address these issues? I really don't want to switch away from PopOS but it seems like I may not have a choice since Cosmic wouldn't run on XOrg and I'm assuming that PopOS 22.04 isn't going to remain supported for long.",1,1750258517.0,pop_os,0,1.0,False

1lej7ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/1lej7ci/curious_how_these_situations_are_handled_legally/,"Curious how these situations are handled legally, socially, and practically","Hi everyone,

I’m asking this because it’s honestly confusing. I see some people being charged for hitting someone who broke into their home, while in other situations, police seem to not care at all. For example, someone once told me that they had just moved into a neighbourhood, and within a week or two, people threw eggs at their house, but the police didn’t take it seriously. On the other hand, I’ve heard of people facing legal trouble over pushing someone during a sports game. So it’s hard to know what the expectations really are.

Below are some fictitious scenarios. I’m not asking for legal advice, just trying to get a sense of how Ontario law and social norms deal with things like this. 

 Scenarios

 **1. Heated Soccer Game**

During a recreational soccer match, a player lightly pushes another after a foul. Nobody is injured, but the other person threatens to call the police.

→ Would this be seen as assault under Ontario law? If someone pressed charges, how likely is it that it would go to court, or be dropped? Would a waiver matter?

**2. Public Verbal Abuse**

In a coffee shop, a person is cut in line and yells, “You immigrants are ruining this country. Go back to where you came from.” It’s loud and offensive, but there are no physical threats.

→ Could this be reported as hate speech or harassment? Would police act, or would most people say it’s just rude and not worth pursuing?

 **3. Garbage Bin Dispute**

Your garbage bin disappears. Later you see your neighbour using a bin that looks exactly like yours, but your address number has been painted over. They deny taking it.

→ Would this be considered theft? Could police get involved, or would you have to go through small claims court? Or is it one of those things people just let go because it’s not worth the legal effort?

**4. Blown Trash Conflict**

A toy or a plastic bag from your yard gets blown into your neighbour’s property during a windstorm. Instead of returning it or throwing it away, they leave it on your porch a week later without saying anything.

→ Would this be seen as a minor nuisance or potential neighbour harassment if it becomes a pattern? Would anyone take legal action over something like this, or is it better to ignore?",2,1750258512.0,legaladviceofftopic,1,1.0,False

1lej2nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAE/comments/1lej2nw/im_a_designer_and_im_stuck/,I’m a designer and im stuck,"This is a rant

I’m a Product designer with over five years of experience, and I’m writing this today because, honestly, I’m at a point where I don’t know what else to do. I’m sharing this in the hope that someone out there might understand, maybe even help—or just listen.

I was born and raised in Dubai. It’s home. After studying and starting my design career in India, I came back here with a dream: to grow, to work with the best, and to build a life doing what I love. But reality hit me hard.

Before I even moved, I was applying to jobs relentlessly. Once I landed, I dove into networking—events, meetups, LinkedIn DMs—you name it. I met people, made connections, even got promises of referrals… but none of it actually led anywhere.

Surprisingly, within the first few weeks, I landed a job at a company in Marina. It felt like everything was finally falling into place. They offered me AED 9,000 with the potential to increase based on performance. I was overjoyed—my family, my girlfriend, everyone was proud. But just two weeks in, things shifted.

Suddenly, the manager who praised my work started rejecting everything. The same work he once approved. Feedback turned erratic. I was made to stay late, endure verbal abuse, and when I asked for some time to consider working another week without pay (yes, without pay), I was told to pack up and leave. That was it. No salary. No notice. Just… out.

I remember walking to the Dubai Mall metro, sitting on a bench, waiting for my girlfriend to come get me so I could cry it out. I hadn’t even received a single paycheck yet.

What followed was months of visa renewals, applying to anything and everything, and even working for my cousin’s startup for AED 2,000/month just to stay afloat. Then came a glimpse of hope—a reputable company loved my work, made me an offer. It required me to be on my own freelance visa, which I was open to. But just as I was about to sign, they sent me an email saying the role was canceled due to internal restructuring. That broke me.

Eventually, a company I admired from India, offered me a role in Dubai. The salary was lower—AED 6,000—but the role was versatile: leading the design school, running operations, and helping build the agency. It wasn’t ideal, but I needed stability.

Fast forward to now—10 months in—and I’m mentally and professionally drained. I work long hours, run classes, manage business ops, and pitch to clients… but I barely get to design. Despite being hired as a designer, I’m doing everything but actual product design. I’ve fought hard to get projects, but I’ve only worked on six, most rushed with unrealistic timelines. My skills are stagnating, and every conversation about growth is met with silence. They wont provide me my deserving salary, health insurance, reimbursements or any basic benefits at all.

And here’s what’s really confusing: I see people with portfolios far weaker than mine working at some of the biggest names in Dubai. I’m not saying this out of jealousy—it’s just baffling. I’ve seen their work, I’ve been in design long enough to know the standard. And yet here I am, struggling to land interviews while others land Emirates NBD, Dubai Holdings, Emaar, and more.

I’ve had my CV reviewed by senior designers. They say it’s great. My portfolio has gotten praise. My LinkedIn is active. I’ve hosted ADPList events, mentored over 90 students, even had RTA Dubai reach out after seeing my case study.

Still, nothing.

I’m at a point where I feel stuck, invisible, and burned out. I don’t know if it’s the market, my luck, or something I just don’t see. I’m sharing this here as a call out to anyone who’s been through something similar—or might be able to help. A lead, a referral, a coffee chat—anything.

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. And if you’re someone who’s hiring or knows someone who is, I’d be grateful to connect. Even a kind message helps more than you know.

At 2 weeks it melted my taste buds.  Lol.

Brewed At 95C, it becomes a complimentary floral note to the fruit-driven flavor profile that has a light acidity on the finish - much like you get when eating actual fruit.  With a touch of sweetness to bring all the flavors together.

An hour or so ago, I spilled about 3/4ths of a cup of coffee on the front of my desktop computer, most of it ran down the front but a good deal of it ran along a section on the top. I immediately shut the power off, dried it off as best I could, unplugged the peripheries and turned it upside down to air dry, and intend to let it sit for about 5 days. From what I can tell, that's what you're supposed to do at first, and after that I'll just have to cross my fingers. I'm wondering what I should or can do in the meantime to improve my odds of not having to trash the entire machine, if anything.

Some details,

My case- the Asus Prime AP201- has holes all along it for ventilation, and therefore a good deal of the coffee dripped down onto the components themselves. The PSU is mounted on the top front, and received the brunt of the damage, I consider it a lost cause, and will be replacing it. The case itself will also have to go, as I'm afraid the coffee got into the USB ports in the front.

As far as I cant tell, the liquid did not come into contact with any other components,- mostly the PSU and the connected wires, though I can't be sure until I take it apart.

1leiuat,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1leiuat/the_gate_part_one/,"""The Gate"" Part One","I have always been a fan of the paranormal, or rather, I have always loved being scared. I remember being a little kid when Netflix first came out, and they would mail you an envelope with a DVD inside. My parents would always come to get me and my little sister to watch whatever they got for us. But once it got late enough, they would kick us out so that they and my older brothers could watch whatever scary movie they had picked for the week. I always *hated* being kicked out, and treated like a child, so one time I put my little-kid foot down, and told my mom that I was old enough, and brave enough, to watch their movie too.

 The movie that they ended up watching was *The* *Descent*. The one about those women that go spelunking into an unmarked cave, in search of the unknown, and are subsequently lost and then tormented by what lived inside.

 Fast forward to the middle of the night, and my at-the-time extremely religious parents were letting me watch a show on Adult Swim about a character that was a literal crime fighting ass. I didn’t find out until years later that it had also taken my mother giving me half a Xanax to knock me out. They had to do so because closing my eyes genuinely sent me into a state of abject terror. 

Even at that age though, I realized I *loved* something about that feeling. That adrenaline rush. The way it makes your heart beat faster, and your breathing labored. The way it somehow makes you acutely aware of everything happening around you, while also tunnel visioning in on what's directly in front of you. Even then I loved that it made me feel *alive*. 

Within a couple years I was watching Poltergeist and the Shining alone upstairs, while my father, the only other person in the house at the time, was asleep on another floor. By high school I had watched every scary movie that Netflix offered at the time. I had grown addicted to that rush. I loved being scared, but when scary movies no longer did the trick I naturally graduated to trespassing. From walking around cemeteries at night to rummaging through abandoned houses in the woods. Anything to get that same feeling. 

A few years later and I had moved out and joined the Navy. I got stationed in Connecticut and made a hobby of touring some of the abandoned asylums that still litter that part of the country. And yet still, eventually, I stopped getting that rush. I had once again grown desensitized to the feeling. As I got older and I shed my childhood beliefs about the supernatural or religion, I realized that the only things you really had to be scared of when walking around asylums in the middle of the night were either being arrested for trespassing or being harassed by the vagabonds that had made the place their home. 

Now, I know that it sounds like I’m just rambling, but I promise that I’m writing this for a reason. If I sound like I’m not making any sense or like I’m just tying random threads together it’s probably because I am. I haven’t slept in a while, but I need to get this all out. I’m also back home for the moment and it’s got me feeling nostalgic for the past.

Anyway, after I moved home from the Navy, I took up the hobby of collecting oddities. Anything that seemed like it could be haunted, or like it just didn’t belong in this world. Things from estate sales or antique shops that were said to have some sort of bad juju, “real” voodoo dolls, shrunken heads, you know the vibe. I’d buy them and take them home, and I’d hope that something would happen. Of course, it never did. And that was fine. They looked neat, I loved the thrill of the hunt for them, and they all made excellent conversation pieces. 

My best friend growing up was a guy I’ll call Danny. Danny shared the same love of being scared that I did, and he was my go-to scary movie partner. And when I moved back home, Danny decided he wanted to get into the business of collecting knick knacks too. From then on, anytime one of us would go out looking for something new to add to our collections, we’d take the other. We did this every few weeks until last year when I moved a couple states away for a job. I was enmeshed in the process of moving and starting a life in an unknown city and unfortunately just hadn’t had the time to keep up with the hobby, or Danny for that matter. At least that’s what I’ve been telling myself. Starting life anew far from home is a daunting and arduous endeavor, *and* I had to work the night shift. It’s hard to keep up with someone when you’re on different schedules, but I’m getting ahead of myself.

My move away from home did not stop Danny from doing what he loved, and every so often Danny would call or text me about whatever new piece he was proud of.

A few weeks ago Danny started hitting me up about a new item that he was really excited about. Calling me every couple of nights telling me that I absolutely had to check it out. He seemed to think that he might have got his hands on something that really could be legit. The real deal. And he wanted me to enjoy it with him. From the couple of pictures I had the time to look at, it just looked like a wooden box to me. But the tone of his messages started to shift, and when they did they shifted rapidly. After the first week of having his new piece, which he took to calling “the gate”, for some reason, his texts grew more erratic. He would send me pictures and videos of him in his house, rambling about this box. About how it made him feel. How looking through the gate was better than any drug he had ever done. And he had done a lot, that much is certain. Whatever “looking through the gate” means? I have no fucking clue. I haven’t yet caught up with all of his messages. I’m hoping that whenever I do it gives me some sort of clue as to what he could have possibly meant.

Now, when I said that Danny liked to participate in the use of illicit substances, I meant it. Of course he liked to smoke and drink a lot, but I’m no prude, and that’s not the kind of stuff I’m talking about. Danny liked to trip. And he would trip often. Whether it was psilocybin, LSD, or DMT, Danny *loved* to escape from this reality into another. I knew how much he loved that kind of thing because we got into it together. I started to get too anxious about doing anymore after my first bad trip, but one bad trip wouldn’t stop someone like Danny. Nor would ten, and maybe not even a hundred. Danny wasn’t good at turning down an opportunity for a good time. 

The point being, however, was that Danny would frequently blow up my phone while he was tripping on a little too much of whatever tickled his fancy for the night talking about how he was “one thousand percent sure” that the “totally real” unicorn head he bought from a guy on Craig’s List had winked at him. Invariably he would get back to me the next day at some point apologizing for his behavior. Embarrassed for making an ass of himself, but not so embarrassed that he wouldn’t do it again in a couple of weeks. I guess that’s probably when I should’ve noticed that something was wrong. He had at least sent me two texts every single day for two weeks about this thing. That should have started ringing the alarm bells for me. 

Danny’s mom, Irene, called me a couple of days ago. Danny’s house burnt down. Absolutely nothing left, nothing but a wooden box among the rubble. Seemingly untouched by a single flame. As if it had been placed there after the fire had been put out, but sitting below too much of what had previously been Danny’s house to have not been there when it all came down. She called me the day after it happened. After she had spoken with the local authorities I was the first person she got in touch with. There was no sign of a body anywhere amongst the ashes and detritus, not yet at least, but they knew that something had been left in the oven that led to the fire. Wherever Danny had gone, whatever it had been that was so important, there were no signs that he had returned.

When Irene called me, half to tell me what had happened and half in hopes that I knew anything at all about what had happened to her child, she was hysterical, and I felt my stomach hit the floor beneath me, and I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. I immediately felt like I was going to puke and pass out all at the same time. A tidal wave of different emotions washed over me, not the least of which was guilt. Danny told me that something was different this time, he *told* me that something was wrong, and I had been too consumed with myself to even watch all of the videos he sent me, or look at any of the pictures. I had barely even read through all of the messages. In a frantic search to see if he had said anything that might be helpful in determining where Danny may have gone, I scrolled down to whatever he had sent me last. It was nothing but a picture. When I saw the timestamp it felt like time froze around me, and the thoughts racing through my mind were the only things that existed. It had been sent mere minutes before the fire would have started. By the time I could wrap my head around what I was looking at, it was too late to regain my composure. I could feel the darkness encroaching upon my vision from all sides the way a swarm of black ants swallow up a sugar cube, and I hit the ground like a bag of wet dirt. 

When I woke up I was in the emergency room. I had flashes of memories of EMS arriving on the scene, then flash to the ride in the ambulance, then flash to now. I was fine, just a couple of stitches and a soon-to-be scar that would surely be visible on my already barren head. At least I didn’t have to worry about a bald spot. I awoke to several missed calls from Irene, and I was still a little bit hazy about how I had ended up in the hospital. Just as I was scrolling through my notifications a new message came in. It was from Irene, and it was an image of a wooden box that split down the middle, with a symbol on the surface of the top, right on either side of where it would open. Two hands reaching out to one another, just about to touch fingertips. Almost exactly like the famous Michelangelo painting of God and Adam. The only difference was that one hand had been carved into the wood, giving it a lighter appearance than what surrounded it, and the other had been burned onto the surface, and had long sharpened fingernails that stretched out past the fingertips. When I saw the picture I snapped back to where I had been and what I had been doing when I passed out. I went back to Danny’s messages to make sure I hadn’t dreamed it while I was out. 

The image showed nothing but a wooden box, no bigger than the size of a suitcase, but maybe 3 feet deep, sitting on the floor of Danny’s room where his bed should be. A circle stretching about 4 feet in every direction, with the box in the center. The rest of the space that stretched out from the box was entirely bare. As if everything and anything within the radius of that circle simply disappeared, and ceased to exist. “God Danny, please tell me you weren’t in that circle”, I thought to myself.

I could feel my breath start to quicken. I felt my heartbeat pick up. I felt the same panic that I felt just a few hours ago before I passed out the first time. Once again thoughts raced inside my head. “What the fuck is even going on. None of this can be happening right now. None of this shit is even real, it’s all just supposed to be some stupid hobby that we picked up to hopefully get a cheap thrill.” 

Blissfully unaware of the irony that I was getting exactly what I had asked for. I wanted something to scare me again, the way things did when I was younger. 

The last thought that went through my head was “please God, please God tell me that Danny wasn’t anywhere near that box whenever… whenever *whatever* the fuck happened to it, happened to it.” And just as that same shadow began to creep its way across my eyes the way it had earlier, everything stopped. I felt as if I’d been hit by a ton of bricks, made of equal parts overwhelming curiosity, and raw abject horror. *Who sent me that picture?*

The thought sent me into action. I checked myself out of the hospital (in accordance with standard hospital practices and procedures. I didn’t do that movie bullshit where they just yank tubes out of their arms and take off. Plus, I was really waiting on them to prescribe me something for the pain. After coming down from the second adrenaline rush my head was throbbing, and it fucking hurt.) and resolved myself to find Danny, and if I couldn’t find Danny the least I could do was give Irene the closure of knowing what had really happened. As if she’d fucking believe me. I know I needed to really watch through all of the dozen or so videos that Danny had sent me, but that could wait until I got back home. I *really* wanted to get my hands on that box.

I went back to my apartment and packed a quick bag and then drove the twelve hours or so back home through the night. I didn’t stop and get anywhere to stay first, I went straight to Irene’s. When I knocked on Irene’s door it was almost a quarter past 9. When she opened up and saw who it was she barreled through the door and wrapped me up in the type of hug that only a mother can give. I hadn’t told her I was coming, but I grew up with Danny so she might as well have been just as much my mother as she was his. She invited me in and offered me a coffee, and I embarrassingly tried to direct the conversation away from her concern about the stitches on my head. She didn’t need to know that it was her phone call that had led to me getting hurt. As soon as our conversation got to a point where it seemed appropriate, I asked if she had been able to keep the box.

“Ahh, I should’ve known why you *really* rushed over here through the night” she joked through a pained smile that almost did enough to brighten her face that I might not have even noticed the black circles that lie under her red and swollen eyes. “I almost forgot that you were the one that had gotten Danny into wasting all of his money on this useless junk.”

I was struck by a pang of guilt at what she said, moreso by what she might’ve been implying. I shook it off. She is much too kind of a lady to hold me responsible for what may or may not have happened to her son, and much too direct to not just say it if that’s how she really felt. I was almost certainly projecting. I hardly believed that anything we ever bought could have been even remotely more than exactly what they appeared to be, mementos of the past that just happened to belong to people that had usually been involved in some form of tragedy; yet, guilty I remained. I couldn’t shake the idea that maybe if I had just read his fucking text messages, or answered his fucking calls that maybe, just maybe, he wouldn’t be missing right now.

“Listen, Irene, I don’t really know what I’m doing here, but I want to find Danny just as badly as you do. And I feel like I need to start at that box.” 

She looked back at me in shock. “Surely you can’t be serious Ian. Surely you don’t believe that that–” she paused briefly, almost as if she was being careful of what to say next. “Surely you don’t really believe that that *box* has anything to do with what happened to my son”

“Just look at how you found it Irene! Look at where it was!” I whisper-shouted at her. A little bit more excitedly than I should have. “I– I don’t know what I believe to be honest” I said in a calmer tone, more fitting for someone who may have just lost her only son. “I don’t know. But the fact that a *wooden box* was found among the still-smoldering remains of a house fire is just– just fucking weird, at the very least. I want to know what happened to him and this just feels like the right place to start”

Irene sighed and began standing up. “Okay well I had em’ put it in the basement, so you’ll have to come with me if you wanna see it. It’s much too heavy, and I’m much too old to be carrying that thing up and down the stairs.” She said to me while looking back with a shit-eating grin. 

I fucking *hate* that basement. I know that despite everything I have said so far, the fact that I’m still freaked out about some random room underneath some random house in the suburbs of North Carolina is absolutely absurd, but some things from your youth you just can’t shake.

“Oh grow up Irene, I’m not twelve anymore. I’m not afraid of some basement” I lied straight through my teeth. 

Now, maybe I’ve watched way too many movies throughout my life, but when I got to the basement and put my hands on that box it just looked and felt like… like a box. A piece of wood. A piece of wood with an admittedly creepy design on the top, but still just a box. I reckon that I thought I’d *feel* something whenever I saw it, but I got nothing. I touched it, and I opened it up, hell I even licked the damn thing and… still nothing.

“See? It’s just a box” Irene said smuggly. “I know that the circumstances around how we found it are weird and all, but it’s just a piece of wood Ian. 

I’ll confess that I really hoped that something would stand out to me about what Danny had given such an ominous and cliche name like “The Gate”, or that I’d get this weird sort of feeling that there was something more sinister going on here, like I was Rust Cohle from *True Detective.* And I started to feel dejected. I was embarrassed at the fact that I really thought that this box might’ve had something to do with Danny’s disappearance, and even more embarrassed that I thought *I* was going to be the one to prove it. I was almost ready to walk out with my tail between my legs when I remembered Danny’s text messages. I hadn’t read all of them yet, just the little bits and pieces that I saw when I scrolled through, and he seemed genuinely terrified by something. And then there was the last picture. The picture that Danny– or whoever– sent me mere moments before his house caught fire. I felt a resolve come over me that all of this simply could not just be one big coincidence.

I asked Irene if I could take the box with me. I lied to her and told her that I didn’t really think it had anything to do with Danny going missing anymore, but that you could never be too safe. She looked at me like I was going crazy, but she acquiesced. 

“Thank you so much for the coffee Irene. It was so nice to see you again”. I hugged Irene a final time as I walked out. I drove through the night and hadn’t slept in well over a day so it was time for me to find a bed for the night. “I love you Irene and I’m so incredibly sorry for what you’re going through right now, but we're going to find out what happened to Danny. I promise. Please call me if you hear anything else from the police. I’ll keep in touch while I’m in town. You’ll see me again.”

And with that, I left. I checked into a shitty -but cheap- motel outside of town to try and grab a couple hours of sleep. Both of my parents had passed away a couple of years ago so once I left my old apartment there was nowhere else for me to come back to. I’m writing this up before I go to bed, so please forgive me if it's riddled with typos and grammatical errors, I am running off of no sleep. I don’t know what I’m hoping to achieve by writing all of this down and posting it on the internet, I just figured that the more people that could get their eyes on this story, the better my chances are of finding Danny. This is a small town buried deep in the middle of the Appalachian mountains where drug dens go up in flames and addicts go missing all the time. Danny likely won’t even make the local newspaper. 

So if what I described about that box means *anything* to *anybody* at all please let me know. Even if writing this down does nothing other than help me to order my thoughts and keep me sane during all of this, then it’ll have been worth it. 

The box is on the ground at the foot of my bed, and I’m desperate to continue playing with it. It almost feels like it’s beckoning me, but I know that I need to sleep. Bad. I’ll look at it again after I wake up. And besides that, I know that I really need to read through all of Danny’s messages and watch his videos, I just really don’t want to. Partly because I’m scared of what I might see, but mostly because I’m scared that if I *do* see something, then the blame will fall on me for ignoring him. I’ve been ignoring his messages the way you ignore your kitchen when you’ve let the dishes pile up for far too long, and you’re scared of what will be there when you finally work up the courage to clean them.

Either way, I can’t do anything to clear my conscience, or find my best friend if I die from over exhaustion. I’m going to post this anywhere that I think it might connect me with people who might know what’s going on. And I’ll keep everyone updated with anything I find out after I wake up. To anyone that has read this far, thank you. Even if you know nothing about what I’ve written, thank you for listening to the ramblings of a grieving friend. 

\-Ian

I just dont feel sexy at all.  I used to dominate a room. I used to have really amazing style.  I dont live in a life anymore that these things matter. I was always a size 6.  Im now pushing a 14.

1leita6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1leita6/i_keep_unintentionally_chasing_guys_awayhelp_lol/,I keep unintentionally chasing guys away...help lol,"I keep reading through reddit threads to find common ground with others and just advice in general to try and tackle my problem. Leaving myself open to scrutiny, so please tell me what you think. I'm nearing my mid thirties and have been back in the online dating pool for some time now after about a 2 year relationship that ended and left me pretty heartbroken. I had been out of the relationship for at least 6 months before I put myself back out there again. I have gone out with a couple handfuls of men over the last 2 years and some of them were really nice, some of them ended up being not so much. Out of all of the dates I've been on I've only found a couple of guys that I felt like I clicked with early on and was attracted to. I keep finding myself in the situation where when I am interested and attracted to the guy, I become excited and want to see them and set up dates. Now I'll admit that when this happens, I can come off a bit strong and persistent try to set up followup dates. When I try to do this, it seems that things fizzle out fairly soon after. My most recent experience with this was a guy who I was talking to via text/voice notes for at least a week before we went on a first date. I was on vacation when we first started chatting and the pace of the conversation was very consistent, plus he would tell me stories about his childhood and other things I wouldn't expect to hear so early on. When we finally went out, the date was very normal- did trivia together then went to a nearby bar and played pool and had a few drinks. We kissed a bit, nothing over the top and we went home separately. He told me about halfway through the date that he was also talking to at least two other ladies, which is not shocking of course but did make me feel a little weird. After the date, I texted him that I had a good time and that I wanted to see him again, and he responded enthusiastically saying something similar. Afterwards, I tried to make small talk via chat, sent him some memes that I thought were funny, but ultimately hoped he would soon ask me out on another date. After a few days, that didn't happen so I asked him when he could get together next and he said he was going out of town the following weekend for a wedding. I just told him to have a good time and left it at that for a few days. I am definitely an anxious person, so after not hearing anything from him by the end of the weekend I sent him another quick text telling him that I hope he had fun and he sent me back a bunch of pictures. All seemed to be fine, except still no plans to meet up again. Well...anyway, the next day I had gone out and met up with some girlfriends, shared a few too many glasses of wine and then started to text the guy again. I was pretty wine wasted I suppose, so some of the texts didn't make any sense but I didn't say anything mean or accusatory...at one point I told him I was ""out petting dogs"" 🤦‍♀️. Anyway, he didn't take this well, and told me that he was going to block me for the night and we would talk in the morning. The following morning I read through my texts and was really embarrassed, so I sent him a message apologizing and not excusing my bad behavior. He responded and seemed understanding, although the tone of the conversation seemed to change. After that, I backed off a little more and waited to see if he would try and make plans. Still nothing. A couple more days went by and I tried to ask what his plans were for the following weekend, and asked him out to a movie that I would pay for. He told me he had friends in town and couldn't, so I just said I understood. A day or two later I asked him what he had planned for the next Friday or Saturday which was a several days away, since those were my only free days due to my work schedule. He told me that he was going out of town again for the weekend but could do coffee on Friday. I told him that I could do evening coffee because I worked until 6pm or dinner if possible. He told me that he would be gone by then, so I responded with ""bummer, well I'm stumped."" After saying this, he started getting a little snippy with me saying that he wasn't sure what I was stumped about and then said that his evenings were busy that week but he could go for afternoon coffee. I responded that he never told me that his evenings were free or that he was only available in the afternoons. He then told me that the weekend means Friday to Sunday and that he would be gone but that afternoon coffee could work. My point was that he never told me a time frame that would work for him to get coffee and I told him that I thought we were miscommunicating. After this, he told me ""I can't with this"" and told me again how he was talking to others ""that's so common"" and that he's seen this kind of talk that is too severe this early on. He then ended the conversation with this isn't going to work and that we are approaching each other completely differently. I tried to call him because I thought that there was a miscommunication, and found out that he had blocked me. I take full responsibility for the night where I drunk texted him and can accept that could be grounds for someone to not want to continue on, but we seemed to get past that. What I'm having a hard time with is that I tried to show some initiative and set up another date because he wasn't doing it and it seemed to really backfire on me. Maybe I was being too pushy? I get that people are busy, I have things going on as well, but I was just trying to make time to squeeze in another date that was already almost 2 weeks after the first. I know this one is scorched earth already, but I'm feeling pretty down about it. Was I being unreasonable? Anyone have a similar story to share.

The minute I met him it is weird, my gut told me something is not right. I want to highlight all the red flags I am about to show and if anyone can give me advice, I'd appreciate it hugely. In addition, when I've brought these up, he's stated the reason I am so worried about the relationship and unsure is because ""I'm mentally unwell.""

1) On the second time meeting him, he took me to a ring shop to get my ring size which I found very unusual and it made me very uncomfortable.
2) The first date he was already suggesting we must date and got upset when I mentioned about me being single as I didn't know him yet and we just started to know eachother on this first day.
3) When I talk to his friends, more than him, he got jealous. I remember sitting for lunch talking to his friend and he was upset that I didn't ask him more questions or speak to him more. 
4) He stated girls cannot be friends with guys and every guy friend I've had, he's questioned, believes I'm seeing them, doesn't like them, doesn't get why I'd get a coffee with them or talk at work. 
5) Commented on what I have worn. Asked if I'm wearing a skirt to show off to someone as it isn't for him or why I'm going with particular gym gear as it shows skin.
6) Got upset if we didn't call every night despite telling him some nights I want to be alone and have me time. I feel he got upset even when I spent time with family...
7) I went travelling which he was very against and upset about. Believed I'd go meet someone. The 3 days I didn't have signal, he goes to a bar, gets very drunk and flirts with girls and gets their Instagrams. 
8) Called me a slut, evil etc when I have expressed I want to split from him or I've told him he's impacting my mental health.

I am a chocoholic and I eat at least a quarter of a bar of pure chocolate(milk chocolate) with some almonds everyday. Apart from that I avoid alcohol and coffee, excessive salt , chips ,any carbonated drinks and have been avoiding them for 20 years . So my diet is basically as follows :

**Breakfast : One slice of white bread (plain white bread gobbled with plain water)**

**Lunch : Two slices of chicken sandwich (the ones with a bit of mayo, its called chicken salad in bread)**

**Tea time : A glass of hot chocolate milk**

**Dinner : Brown rice and 2 chicken thighs and vegetables and an apple**

**Post Dinner : Milk chocolate the size of 4 fingers**

I go to the gym 3- 4 times a week and do mostly strength training. My steps on the average per day is around 6000 , as I am working.

1leilmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/1leilmq/unemployed_six_months_now_and_at_my_wits_end/,Unemployed six months now and at my wits end,"I lost my job at the end of January this year. I also got engaged and got a puppy, which was pretty insane timing. As my personal life has stabilized and calmed, I've started seriously applying in the last two months or so. Prior to that I would apply here and there casually.

The last two months have been very intense with applying. I reworked my applications (even got people to kindly review my docs), I've updated my Linkedin, I've reached out to recruiters and job posters, I've tried networking with virtual coffee meetups, joined a “women in product” group, etc. I have been ghosted several times. Whenever I get a rejection, I go to their email to see if I can maybe request feedback, but it is ALWAYS ""no reply"". I had friends at my past company refer me to their current company and couldn't even secure a courtesy interview. I got rejected on a Saturday two days after applying and a full week before the application date closed. I am applying for roles significantly lower to what I should be doing (junior roles, associate roles, etc) and for roles that are even contract (a last resort for me).

When I do manage to secure an interview, which has happened a few times, it goes well. I get a couple rounds deep, and then ghosted. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.  

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm a product manager with five years experience under my belt. I keep trying and just running headfirst into brick walls of rejection over and over and over and over and over and over again.

I feel so ashamed. I can't even look my fiancé's parents in the eye and I can feel myself spiraling into a depression. I feel I have tried so many different tactics and I'm beginning to lose hope and internalize every rejection as a failing about me as a person and never being good enough.

So far this month, 1,590 participants have shown up at Cooper’s Landing to learn about and connect with the environment there. Last year, the total number for June was 1,346. In 2022, the number was 867.

And when the program started five years ago, “I just prayed that people would come,” said Kristen Schulte, the education director for Missouri River Relief, which hosts the program in partnership with First Chance for Children.

Mornings at the River is for families with children through age 5. “We’re growing the next generation, the next stewards of the river,” Schulte said.

She likens the program to “a good Disney movie”: Children like it, and the more familiar they get with it, they want to see it again and again.

On their first visit to the Big Muddy, children might stick close and hug their parent’s leg, Schulte said. But on each visit, as the children return to the same learning stations with something new to explore at each one, their confidence and excitement flourishes.

Themes vary from session to session at the learning stations overlooking the river. For this final week, the focus was fish.

In the pretend play area, children acted as doctors and listened to the heartbeats of fish-shaped stuffed animals with a stethoscope.

At another station, children stood in the shade of camping tents and pretended to cook on a toy camp stove. “Mom, do you want lemon in your coffee?” said 3-year-old Nora Tassone, handing her mother, Megan Tassone, a coffee mug and a plastic lemon slice.

“I like your style,” her mother responded, laughing and accepting the mug. “Can I have coffee without lemon, too?”

At a nature craft spot, children rolled paint onto a stone fish then pressed the wet fish onto paper to make a print.

Each week, Mornings on the River welcomes a different special guest. This week, it was the Missouri Department of Conservation, whose employees brought tadpoles and crayfish for the children to investigate.

Augie Thall, 4, looked through a magnifying glass at an adult crayfish held by Tyler Steinkoetter, a science assistant for the Conservation Department. The crayfish waved its pincers in Augie’s direction, and Augie waved back.

A nature sounds scavenger hunt was set up on a short stretch of the Katy Trail. Cora Boyd, 3, listened for the sound of running water and the tweet of birds. She tried to make a whistle sound by blowing on a hollow horsetail plant. Cora, her 4-year-old brother, Kurt, and her mother, Michele Cosper, all matched in T-shirts they tie-dyed at Art in the Park this month.

Closer to the river, Ashley Rippentrop sat with her 2½-year-old son, William, in a canoe resting on the grass under the trees. William reeled in the line on his toy fishing pole.

This is William’s first year participating in Mornings at the River, his mother said.

“This is right up his alley, he loves nature,” Rippentrop said before turning to him. “Want to cast the line again?”

Schulte said the program had to close registration three weeks before the event began, because it had reached its capacity for families signing up.

She said the program’s growth was more than she could’ve ever hoped for.

“It’s not just kids growing with the river — the families are growing, too,” Schulte said. “The program is building tradition within the family.”

1leifia,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1leifia/a_huge_poly_drama_7m_of_my_life_and_loosing_fate/,A huge poly drama (7m of my life) and loosing fate on myself as a poly person.,"I (25F) am on a relationship with my partner (26M) for 2 years and a month now. 
At the begging of the relationship I stated that I would like it to be open, since I had been in 3 more poly relationships before and it was working out fine with me. He had his worries on if he can support this but he agreed, saying though that he believes for himself that he's only able to love one person at the time, but he wants to try and make it work out. 
During the first 1.5y of the relationship some romantic interests for other people occurred to me, but since when I was communicating it with my partner he was getting anxious or cautious, I decided not to pursue any of them and I was mostly fine with it, because I really valued my relationship.

We had quite frequent talks about how we will communicate if any of us hooks up with another person, and we had said that if/when that happens we both prefer to be told immediately (like the morning after) even from the phone or a message.

~ THE DRAMA ~

(NOVEMBER) Two weeks after one of those conversations, he tells me that he slept with my best friend (30F), 4 days ago. It was a shock. First, because it was my best friend and I had told to both of them that if they have feelings for each other I would like to know it and discuss it, second because he didn't told me at the agreed time. It really hurt. But I decided that because they were both people that I valued, I'm not going to completely stop these relationships.

(DECEMBER) A month later though we broke up because we were just discussing the last situation over and over again, I was being sad, he was feeling guilty, etc. He asked me not to talk for the first month so he can get used to the new situation, because ""what am I going to do without you, I had imagined my life with you"".

(JANUARY) Three weeks passed during which he texted me something small every 3-4 days, that I didn't know how to answer. 
I was very bad and emotionally unstable at the period, so when he asked me if I want to go out with him again I said yes and we slept together. 
On that day he told me that he had arranged a coffee date with another girl (26F) in two days, I said that I don't feel good about it, and he's said that he's feeling bad to cancel.
On next week and while we had started talking and going out as usual they went on a second date and during this I just couldn't stop having bad thoughts and being anxious, almost had a panic attack. 
That had never happened to me before, in all my previous relationships I was fine handling my jealousy, but that day I was going crazy. 
So the next day I have a conversation with him stating that if he wants to be together with me again, at this moment I am feeling so bad with myself that I can't support that other relationship that he's starting to form. His answer was that ""I don't want to stop the other relationship even though I want to be with you"". (that conversation happened again two weeks later and he told me ""take it or leave it"", but I was so so mentally drawn already) 

(FEBRUARY) For the next month we kept dating, and he was going out with the other girl once per week. That day was always difficult for me. 
Then the girl said to him that for him trying to fix his primary relationship (with me) takes time and effort, so she can't be in the picture. And she asked to stay friends. My partner though started going to ceramics workshops with her from the next week on (which I had asked not to), so they ended up sleeping together again (6 days after the staying friends conversation). 
To get over the situation, that had become a huge burden on me, because first of all *I was fighting myself on why now all of a sudden I can't support a poly relationship*, I started dating other people too. And it really helped me, though, freaked out my partner that I'm going to dump him.

(MARCH) Extreeeemely tragic and funny add up to the whole drama is that the one new person (27NB) that I am still 3 months later, dating, had been to two dates with the same girl that my partner is dating, but after that they decided to keep it friendly.

(APRIL) For a month in between, I think we were all pretty much happy and calm about our relationships. Then, the other girl discussed with my partner that she needs more attention and time and that she had started feeling jealous and weird on the days that she knows that we are together. My partner though rejected it politely. So, after the Easter vacations that me and my partner took some more time together and they didn't, she asked him to split up, stop talking and go to ceramics on different days.

(MAY) My partner was sad and I tryed being there for him. Though, on the next month our relationship started to look like last year again, which comforted me. In a conversation that we had about what is the form of our relationship now and our new boundaries, he told me that he's thinking of texting the other girl again, after she finishes uni for the summer. I said that I still don't feel fine with it, because my stomach hurts everytime that we talk about her still but to ask me again when the time comes.

(JUNE) Last week he texted her about the ceramics workshops and on Wednesday the class had an exhibition, so I went there with my partner and met the other girl too. It felt like a relief at first, though, I couldn't stop my mind from comparing the two of us (that has never happened in that degree ever again). When at home my partner asked me how I felt, I said the truth: a relief and then a stomach ache. We ended up fighting, because as he says he can't talk to me about it since he knows that it will make me feel bad, even though, I know for myself that I can change that emotion after the conversation and mostly, I don't control it, I don't feel intentionally bad.

(NOW) Yesterday I heard from the other person that I'm dating that the girl finished her uni for the year and she's more chill now. An hour later my partner texted me after his ceramics that she was there, asked him to go home together and told him that she wants to talk. So he asked me to talk with HIM about it when we meet again. 
Honestly, I broke down. 
I don't think that I have anything new to say. 
I don't like veto power and mostly I don't like not being eble to cop with that specific girl. 
I saw that my partner was sad during the month that they were off and that hurt, because I want him to be happy.
But during the whole year I feel like I'm being paranoid and going insane with the whole situation, because there are just things adding up, they are breaking up and then they are not, etc. I passed 2 months having nightmares about it and waking up with stomach aches and I don't want it to happen again.

My mind starts screaming to me to leave but on the other hand poisons me that if I leave I'll just let them to their happy (monogamous) relationship.

The biggest problem is that every time I try to set up a boundary on that relationship I see that he's not respecting it and even things that I asked to make the situation feel better for me -like a letter from him stating his feelings, to calm me down when I'm having anxiety attacks because they are out together- never happened.

1leiawb,https://www.reddit.com/r/terf_trans_fight/comments/1leiawb/the_emulate_versus_live_paradox/,"The ""Emulate"" Versus ""Live"" Paradox","I'm taking the title of this post from this comment, which is a really common comment by *Gender Criticalists*:

>This doesn't make any sense to me. I don't live ""as a woman."" What does that even mean? No one I know would describe their existence like this.

>If one isn't a woman but is ""living like a woman,"" where are they getting their assumptions from? Who are they emulating?

I think there's a big disconnect in *Gender Criticalist* discourses over what someone like me says when I say I live ""as a woman"".

On Trans Twitter, it was easier for me to list all the things in my daily life and say ""Is this living as a woman"", and then we'd go from there. Because I get the impression a lot of them think we mean ""I put on my hip pads, fake breasts, some lippy, draw on my eyebrows, and trowel on makeup.""

When *Gender Criticalists* describe our lives they seem to include a lot of that sort of language.

My day starts fairly early with a bit of minor housekeeping, making coffee, figuring out breakfast, planning my work day, then gathering up my things for work and driving to the office. When I say I live ""as a woman"", what I mean is that once I leave the house people just seem to think I'm a woman.

Nowhere in what I wrote above is any mention of hip pads, fake breasts, a splash of lippy, or any other their other misconceptions.

I'm not ""emulating"" anyone. I'm an engineer and a home owner and I have cats. My life revolves around being an engineer, a home owner, and having cats. My personality is what it is, and there are people I admire for common traits or aspirations. Some of them are men, some of them are women, and I don't emulate them. There are social and political goals I care deeply about, and people who've been involved with those things. Some of them are men, some of them are women, and I don't emulate them.

One of my bigger fights on *Trans Twitter* was over sexist stereotypes - that assertion we are ""emulating"" their own personal private sexist stereotypes. Ignoring for a moment that I'm not emulating anything, there is a very real danger to ""emulating our sexist stereotypes"". And that is, if ""sexist stereotypes"" are a thing which belongs to a sex, and that ""emulating our sexist stereotypes"" is a bad thing, when do men get to start critiquing women who are ""emulating \[male\] stereotypes""?

It is either okay for trans people to emulate opposite sex behavior, because that's just an okay thing, or it's not okay for cis people to perform opposite sex behavior, because logical consistency demands that. Is it wrong if men do things associated with women and vice versa? The answer had better be ""no"".

The more accurate issue is the one *Gender Criticalists* also often get wrong. I don't think I'm a woman because I ""do"" a bunch of sexist stereotypes. I'm an engineer, a home owner, and I have some cats. I do engineering, I maintain a house, I feed my cats. I don't think I'm a woman because women are particularly well known for engaging in the kinds of forestry things I've been engaging in lately. I don't think I'm a woman because I need to clean a bunch of litter boxes before putting the trash out this evening. They often have the mindset backwards, and then insist what they think we do is what we are really doing.

I live ""as a woman"" because that is what society sees while I do engineering, tend my yard and talk about my cats.",2,1750256313.0,terf_trans_fight,1,1.0,False

It’s silent. Victoria lays on the floor, still grinning in death. Amanda lays beside her, eyes vacant and staring. I think about Nicky. She had the same look in her eyes too. Karla doesn’t say a word but she’s staring at the bodies. Clover is still sobbing, and I move a little closer to check on her.

   “Are you alright?” I ask softly. She’s shaken but clearly not hurt.

I glance over at Adrian last. She’s remained rooted to the spot, although her breathing is heavy and panicked. The impassive armor she’s always donned is fractured. She’s scared. She’s trying so hard to hide it but she can’t. Just like the rest of us, she knows how this ends.

Her eyes dart around. First to Karla, then to Clover and I. She opens her mouth finally but no sound comes out. The panic has caught in her throat. It takes her a few moments to articulate whatever it is she’s trying to say.

   “Are you just going to sit there?” She finally asks and I wonder if she actually expects someone to respond to her. 

   “It was one of you… it had to be…” She continues. She looks at Karla again. *“She’s going to fucking kill us! Are you really just going to sit there and watch?”*

   “We’re all dead anyway,” I say softly. 

   “N-no… that’s not what Mama said… she said it only has to be the one who talked… just them. Not the rest of us. *Just them! Just YOU!”*

I sigh.

   “You really believe that?” I ask. 

   “What’s the point in killing all of us?! We’re the ones bringing money in! I-it’s more trouble just to kill us…”

   “For Kim, maybe…” I say. “Not for Patrice.”

That name gives Adrian pause. 

   “All of us went out with Vagas at one point,” I say. “Even if Mama figures out who talked, he’s going to wonder if whoever Mama hands him was the only rat… and once he starts wondering that, he’s going to get paranoid.”

   “No…” Adrian says under her breath, but I can see her doing the math in her head. We all know what Patrice is capable of. She looks up at me again. I look back at her… and I can see the click behind her eyes. 

   “You fucking coward…” She finally says, although it’s quiet. My body tenses up a little. I glance at Karla behind her, but Karla isn’t paying any attention to us. Good.

   “We’re all going to die here anyway,” I say before I quietly go back to focusing on Clover. I’ve been rubbing her back, trying to help her relax and calm down. It’s not working.

Adrian opens her mouth to speak again, but I can hear Mama Kim’s phone ringing in the next room. I can hear Mama growling in frustration. Then a moment later she storms back in. Has it been fifteen minutes already? It doesn’t feel like it… but I don’t exactly have a watch. 

I watch as Mama walks past us, toward the kitchen. She takes out a spoon, a knife, a lighter and a baggie full of syringes. She smooths down her hair again before looking back at us. I half expect Adrian to call out to her, but she doesn’t. Like the rest of us, she just watches. 

   “Alright…” Mama says. “Let’s get back into it, yeah?”

She returns to us again, and drags a glass topped coffee table over before putting most of the things she got from the kitchen on it. The knife, I see her pocket.

   “New tactic, alright?” From her pocket, she produces a small baggie. I know what’s inside of it. Dope. She waves it back and forth, and all eyes in the room follow it.

   “Whoever talks… gets this.”

We watch as she fills the spoon with water from the drowning bucket, and adds a bit of the dope. Her eyes repeatedly dart back to us. 

   “This right here… this is Mama’s private stash…” She promises, as she flicks the lighter. We watch as she dissolves the dope, then draws it up into a sterile needle. She holds it delicately between her fingers, and stares expectantly at us.

   “So who’s gonna talk?” She asks.

Karla looks like she’s gearing up to say something. She’s staring at that needle like a hungry dog, but Adrian breaks first.

   “I-it’s Faith, Mama… she was talking while you were gone, it has to be her!”

I knew this was coming. I’ve known it since before this night began. But my heart still stops dead in my chest as the reality of my coming death washes over me once again and I know I’m not ready for it. Oh God, I’m not ready.

Mama Kim is staring at me now. Finally she moves, setting the syringe down on the glass surface of the coffee table and stalking toward me. 

   “That true, Faith?” She asks. 

   “N-no Mama Kim… I wouldn’t… I’d never, I-”

Her hand closes around my neck. My heart rate spikes. She grabs me, dragging me over toward the bucket. She’s so much stronger than she looks and even though I struggle, I can’t fight her off. I hear Clover let out a whimper. I see her reaching for me, begging me not to go. Adrian is glaring at me although I see a flicker of remorse in her eyes, as if there’s a part of her that’s all too aware of what she’s just sentenced me to. Karla is grinning. 

   *‘No… no, I’m not ready…’*

My head is pushed under the water. I scream as I’m submerged under its tepid surface. I can see Adrian’s glasses sitting at the bottom from when Mama went after her earlier. She holds me down there until I can’t take it anymore, until my lungs burn, until I can’t scream anymore… then I feel her fingers sink into my hair and pull me back up. 

   *“You got something to fucking tell me, Faith?”* I hear her snarl. *“You got something to say?!”*

I don’t speak… although I do consider it. For a moment I consider spilling my guts right then and there. Logically, I know it won’t save me. At best it will only delay the inevitable by an hour or so… but I was never going to be saved, was I? 

I’ve known for a long time that I’m meant to die here and I made my peace with that already… at least, I thought I did. But now that it was my head in the bucket, fear overwrote reason. I know I can’t talk. I know it won’t change anything, but I’m still so scared to die.

Somewhere in the room, I can hear Clover begging for my life. 

   *“If she’s the rat, let her fucking drown!”* Karla snaps. Her voice sounds so far away. I can see my reflection in the water of the bucket… my own sunken eyes, wide, puffy and crying, my matted black hair. I look like a corpse already. It would be so much easier to just die but I’m scared, I’m so fucking scared…

Mama pushes my head under the water again, she barely even gave me a moment to catch my breath. Even if I wanted to break, I don’t think I would have had the time. Darkness creeps in at the edge of my vision. Mama Kim pulls me back again. Adrian looks away. She’s shaking. Clover is screaming.

   *“MAMA, MAMA PLEASE! MAMA, STOP! PLEASE, SHE’S DYING!”*

   “Oh, she’s gonna die if she doesn’t fucking talk…” Mama growls.

I notice the dead girls out of the corner of my eye as I gasp for air.

   *“What happened with you and Vagas!”* Mama demands.

   *“D-drinks…”* I manage to rasp. It’s not a complete lie.

   “Drinks? And what else? Tell me!” 

   *“J-just drinks…”*

   *“BULLSHIT!”* 

   *“I-it wasn’t me, Mama… it wasn’t… I wasn’t talking, Mama… it’s the dope… Adrian just… just wants the fucking dope!”*

Her name just slips out… I don’t even think about it. It’s a panic response as I thoughtlessly blurt out whatever might keep me alive for just a moment longer, even if I know that there’s no point to it. I know it’s better to die like this! If I die like this, then Mama will have nothing and when Patrice comes, he’ll kill her. I have to die here. I have to die right now.

But I can’t… I don’t want to die, I’m too scared! I don’t want to die… not here… not like this… and so I make a mistake. I say Adrian’s name and cast the finger of suspicion back on her. 

   “That’s not true!” Adrian protests. “She was talking before you came in! Karla and Clover heard it too!”

She looks over at Karla, who seems to freeze up for a moment as if she doesn’t know exactly what to say, before finally nodding.

   “Y-yeah… I heard it!” She lies.

Clover on the other hand isn’t so complicit.

   “She was only talking because you were!” She stammers. “You’re the one who started pointing fingers!”

   “Because I don’t want to fucking die here!” Adrian says. 

   “So it’s okay to just watch her drown?!”

   “Like she did to Victoria and Amanda?”

   “We don’t know if it was her!” 

   “She was just talking about how we were all going to die!”

   “That doesn’t mean she’s the one who talked to Vagas! How do we know you’re not just trying to cover your own arse!”

   “Jesus fucking Christ, GIRLS!” Mama Kim finally snaps. *“Will you cut it the fuck out!”*

   “No! Adrian’s just after the dope!” Clover argues. 

   “And you aren’t?” Karla asks, her tone sardonic and smug. “I’m sorry sweetie, did you get lost on your way to fucking Bible study?” 

   “Fuck off!” Clover snaps back.

Karla spits at her. 

   “You fuck off!” 

The spit hits Adrian, who can only look at Karla and ask: 

   *“What the fuck is wrong with you?!”*

   *“ENOUGH!”* Mama Kim tries to say again, but by this point, Adrian, Karla and Clover are right in each other's faces. Clover grabs at Karla first, and moments later the two are on the floor. I watch as Karla squirms out of Clover’s grasp and pushes her into Adrian, who pushes her back to the ground before lunging at Karla.

Mama Kim pushes me aside to break them up. In her hasty attempt to reach them, she gracelessly knocks the bucket over, spilling the water everywhere. She grabs Adrian and pulls her off of Clover. I watch Adrian kick and thrash, screaming all the while.

   *“NO! NO, YOU FUCKING BITCH! IT’S THEM! IT’S ONE OF THEM! THEM!”*

Mama hits her hard and sends her back to the ground, leaving her lying in that puddle of water. 

   “Fuck you…” Adrian pants, *“FUCK YOU!”*

Mama grabs her by the hair. 

   “You wanna fucking say that again?” She demands. 

   “FUCK YOU!” Adrian’s eyes burn into Mama Kim’s. There’s no stoicism. Not anymore. Only pure, raw hatred. Mama slaps her once again, then pins her to the ground.

   “Getting sick of this fucking shit…” She pants as she grabs one of Adrian’s hands and pins it to the ground. She squirms beneath her as Mama takes out the knife she pocketed earlier. Karla cackles at the sight of it.

   *“Yeah, Mama!”* She cheers. *“Make her sing!”*

   *“ONE OF YOU TALKED.”* She says, voice quaking with rage. “I’m tired of this fucking runaround. I’M SICK AND I’M FUCKING TIRED, so we’re going to put this shit to bed right fucking now. TELL ME WHO IT WAS, *NOW*, or so help me God I’ll skin every single last one of you worthless sacks of shit, *DO YOU FUCKING HEAR ME!*” 

I hear her… just maybe not in the way she wants me to. All I hear is desperation. Panic from a woman with only two tools, violence and dope. I just stare at her and as she began to cut into Adrian’s left pinkie finger, like she did for me, I look away.

I still hear the screams though. Raw. Ragged. Agonized. Even Karla seems to flinch at the sound of them and her smile falters for a moment. Adrian shrieks in both pain and horror as Mama pushes the knife through her finger and severs it cleanly from her hand. I can see it rolling away from her, and I can see the way her eyes widen as a part of her body is just… detached. 

   *“No…”* The word comes out as a  half sob, half scream. She tries to pull her trembling, bloody hand out of Mama Kim’s grasp but Mama keeps her grip tight.

   “Any takers?” Mama demands, looking between me, Karla and Clover. 

   *“PLEASE!”* Adrian sobs. *“PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE…”*

Her words trail off into another howl of pain as Mama begins to cut into her ring finger. Clover is watching with wide eyes and finally she breaks.

   *“IT WAS ME, ALRIGHT!”*

No… no, what are you doing?

Mama Kim looks up at her, eyes wide.

   *“It was me…”* Clover sobs. “Just stop it, please… please just fucking stop it…”

Mama glares at her, then finally she stands. Her hands are covered in blood. Her pants are soaked from the water on the floor. She’s still holding the knife.

   “You little fucking cunt…” She growls before she advances on Clover. I can see the panic in Clover’s eyes. She tries to scramble backwards, tries to escape but Mama is on top of her in a matter of seconds, pinning her to the ground by the throat.

   *“FUCKING LITTLE RAT, CUNT! WHAT ELSE DID YOU TELL HIM!”*

   *“O-ONLY WHAT HE ASKED!”* Clover stammers.

   *“WHAT ELSE DID YOU FUCKING TELL HIM.”* 

Her phone is ringing again. *Heaven Is A Place On Earth.* Mama doesn’t even seem to notice. Her hand is around Clover’s throat, squeezing the life out of her. Amanda’s corpse is staring at me. Hollow eyes burning into my soul… just like Nicky’s. 

I need to say something. I can’t let her die.

   “M-Mama…” I stammer. I drag myself closer, try to put a hand on her shoulder. Try to stop her from killing Clover. I need to confess. I can’t let her die. But before I can get another word out, Mama beats me me back down to the ground.

   *“SHUT UP!”* She roars, before returning her attention to Clover. *“Did you tell him about the fucking drugs?”*

   “Y-yes Mama… the drugs we use… I told him…”

   “Not *THOSE* fucking drugs you stupid pig!” She hits Clover again and she whimpers in pain. “The ones at the fucking chop shop!”

   “Y-yeah at the butcher shop…” Clover babbles. “At the butcher shop!”

   “CHOP SHOP, STUPID CUNT!”

   “T-that’s what I said…? T-they come in with t-the meat… in the animal carcasses…?”

Mama pauses.

   “What?” She asks, her tone a lot more even now.

   “T-the drugs…” Clover stammers. “In the animal c-carcasses…”

Mama just keeps staring down at her.

   “In animal carcasses…” She repeats.

Everything is silent for a moment and I watch as Mama Kim slides off of Clover and sinks against the wall, still holding the knife. She looks exhausted, all of a sudden and I know that she’s just figured out what the one smart thing she did tonight was. 

She never told any of us exactly what Detective Vagas had done or what information had been leaked. The only people in that room who knew, were the ones who’d already known it when they first came in. 

   “M-Mama…?” Clover rasps. 

Mama Kim looks up at her, then back toward Adrian, who by now has crawled over toward her severed finger and is curled into a fetal position. 

   “Kill her, Mama…” Karla says. “Just kill her already! Finish it off! Do it, Mama!”

Clover glances over at her, wide eyed and afraid but Mama Kim doesn’t move. 

   “What are you waiting for, Mama! She’s the rat, isn’t she? Mama?”

   *“Shut the fuck up, Karla…”* Mama snaps before the exhaustion sets back in. Her attention returns to Clover now, who is looking at her like a deer in the headlights.

   “You’re all heart…” She finally says. “You’re full of shit, but you’re all heart. Animal carcasses in a butcher shop… gotta say, it’s a good one.”

Clover looks confused.

   “I don’t… isn’t that what…?”

   “A chop shop isn’t the same thing as a butcher shop you fucking moron,” Mama says. “But for what it’s worth, I appreciate the fucking balls it takes to own up to something you didn’t even do… and for her, no less.” She nods over at Adrian. 

   “Y’know I personally never fucking liked her. Always had such a fucking stick up her ass. Not the kind of person I’d stick my neck out for but, hey, you do you.” 

   “N-no, it was really me, Mama… it was really.”

   “Shut up, Clover.” Mama’s voice is calm, cold. She grunts as she stands up again, and starts toward Adrian again. She pauses for a moment, before looking around at us. 

   “Anyone else feel like confessing?” She asks, her tone still unsettlingly calm. 

   “Alright then… well let’s get right bac-”

Almost on cue, her phone rings. The ringtone is different this time. It’s not *Heaven Is A Place On Earth*. It’s a french song. ‘*Laisse tomber les filles*’. Mama freezes. She rips her phone out of her pocket. The confusion in her eyes is evident, although it quickly turns into rage.

   *“What the fuck?”*

She rips the phone out of her pocket and storms away from us to answer it.

   *“Whoever the fuck this is, this isn’t fucking funny! Stop calling this fucking number or I’ll hunt you the fuck down fucking MAKE you stop, do you fucking hear me?! DON’T YOU FUCK WITH ME, ASSHOLE!* ***DON’T YOU FUCKING FUCK WITH ME!”***

I can hear only silence on the other end of the line… the same silence I’ve heard every other time I’ve seen her answer the phone tonight. Only this time, something breaks it. Laughter. The quiet chuckle of someone else. Then the line goes dead. The call disconnects. Mama screams.

   ***“GODFUCKINGDAMNIT!”***

In one swift motion she hurls her phone across the apartment. It leaves a dent in the drywall and sends cracks across the screen. Mama is panting heavily. She looks back over towards us, her face is red. She smooths down her hair but doesn’t take a step toward us.

   “Stop looking at me…” She says and when we don’t look away, she screams it.

   *“STOP FUCKING LOOKING AT ME!”* Her hands shake as she reaches into her pocket for her cigarettes. Then without another look she turns, going out toward the balcony of the apartment… and all is silent once again.
