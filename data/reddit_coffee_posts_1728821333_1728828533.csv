Hi everyone! 

This is my first time posting here so I apologize if this goes against any of the sub rules somehow! I'm looking for some MF dark romance recommendations.

I am currently reading Beautiful Villain by Rebecca F. Kenney and I'm definitely enjoying the vampire aspect - more than I expected. So I'm okay with light fantasy but I'm newer to those books. 

I am not interesting in any MMC cheating/OW plots! This is an automatic no for me. I would honestly prefer a book without a third act breakup/more external conflict than internal if possible. I also don't like pregnancy plots (unless it's in the epilogue). 

As for the MMC..I like a morally grey character. I want an MMC that is obsessed with the FMC from the start. Specifically though, I'm looking for an MMC that is soft with the FMC, but hard with everyone else. Very much an 'i'll do anything for you, you're mine' kind of vibe. I don't want an MMC that is a player or a party boy. So not any books that revolve around nightlife/partying heavily. 

I would love if the FMC was a baker/worked at a bakery or coffee shop but that is a minor detail! I would like an FMC that is artsy/quieter. I have no problems with a 'not like other girls' FMC. I don't necessarily want an FMC who's overly worried about 'doing the right thing', but she also doesn't have to be as 'dark' as the MMC. More of an 'that's not really my business/keep me out of it' sort of vibe. 

I want the relationship between the two MC's to be protective. I would love if there were scenes where the FMC needs the MMC's protection or where the MMC needs comforting from the FMC. 

I think I would like arraigned marriage books/they could fit this vibe without being overly dark. I'm not interested in anything that revolves around the underworld, I would rather a book that is slightly realistic but also dark (more so mafia/criminal than supernatural/demons if that makes sense). I like age gap books and I don't really have any limits otherwise. I'm a sucker for workplace romances but I don't know how well that fits into dark romance. 

Thanks so much for your help! I haven't read many books in this genre so I am open to anything y'all recommend! I tried to post this in the romance books subreddit but I didn't have enough karma so I'm really hoping y'all can help me! ",1,1728828403.0,SpicyRomanceBooks,0,1.0,False

1g2qd98,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenGems/comments/1g2qd98/casabrews_espresso_machine_20_bar_review_worth/,CASABREWS Espresso Machine 20 Bar Review: Worth the price?,"I recently tried the CASABREWS Espresso Machine and found it to be a great option for home baristas. It’s compact and stylish, fitting seamlessly into my kitchen setup without taking up too much space. The 20-bar pressure system really stood out, delivering rich, aromatic espresso with a satisfying crema. The built-in pressure gauge helped fine-tune the brew for my taste.

The steam wand was effective at creating creamy microfoam for lattes and cappuccinos, although it did take some practice to get the technique right. One downside is that the portafilter feels a bit flimsy, and the machine requires a cooling period after frothing before you can brew another shot, which can be inconvenient if you're in a rush. Despite this, it consistently delivers café-quality drinks at home.

For anyone looking to upgrade their coffee experience without breaking the bank, this machine offers solid performance, especially for single or double espresso shots. It’s user-friendly, heats up quickly, and the 34oz removable water tank is easy to refill and clean. Some users have noted minor durability issues with the portafilter, but overall, the machine provides good value for its price.

Pro tip: After frothing, give the machine a minute or two to cool down, or run a bit of water through the system to quickly lower the temperature and speed up the brewing process. Overall, for the price, it’s a great entry-level machine

Then, you can go into the larger daily view, where you can list your must-do tasks for the day—things that absolutely need to be completed, like an important phone call or a report you need to send.

You can dive even deeper into the daily schedule, which integrates with Google, allowing you to plan out every hour. I don’t understand the need for any template; I think Supernote has provided everything you need with this device.

Not saying anyone is wrong for wanting or looking for a template, I just want to make sure everyone knows that the essentials are all there. Keep things simple and use that brain power for something that matters more.

The stainless steel design looks sleek on the counter, and the gooseneck spout really helps with precise pouring, which is a game-changer for pour-over coffee. The temperature control is highly accurate, with the app letting me choose specific settings down to a degree, making it great for different types of teas too.

It heats up fast (around 3-5 minutes for 0.8L of water) and the keep-warm feature is super handy, keeping the water at the right temp for up to two hours. However, a couple of things could be better. For one, the kettle doesn’t have a display to show the temperature, so you always need the app to check. Also, if you fill it past 0.65L, you might get a bit of water spitting out of the spout when it boils, which is something to watch out for​

The flow rate is a bit fast, so I have to be careful while pouring, especially with tea leaves or finer grind coffee​. There’s also no visible water level indicator, which makes filling it a little awkward​.

Me and my best friend Marie (both F, 16y) have been friends since 2nd grade. She has been like a sister to me ever since we have met each other and has always been by each others side all the time. One problem was that when we grew closer and got used to each other Marie starts getting more and more protective of me.

For example she would turn down everyone that I talked with and would always make a big fit about it saying that I don't hang out with her often and would cry about it in hopes she gets my attention. She would also compare me to other beautiful people and start body shaming me saying I eat too much or I am trying to outshine her by being skinny so I have to eat more.

Another problem was there was no way I could talk to other people because she was in all of my classes.

When 10th grade was over, Marie went on a vacation with her family to Florida to visit her grandparents. I never felt so happy in my life. All the weight of pain and depression lifted from my shoulders.

One day while driving to my local coffee shop I saw this guy Jay (M,17y) who was at my school going to the coffee shop I was going to too. We had talked to each other several times but always get interrupted by Marie because of her protective behavior so we never talked that much.

I decided to invite him over to my table because the table was empty and I was in a good mood that day. He immediately came over to my table and we had a good time and a good laugh, we also exchanged numbers considering the fact that my contacts are only my mom, dad, and ofc, Marie, so I was really happy I have someone to talk to over the summer while Marie was gone.

After that day, me and Jay would constantly talk to each other and have dates constantly, to the point he asked to be his girlfriend forever. I ofc said yes.

Summer break was over and 11th grade started and unfortunately Marie was back to school happy to see me and for reason, that day was also a good day for me so I told her how me and Jay are officially dating. After I said those words, she immediately starts crying saying she never agreed to make me go on a date and get a boyfriend. I told her to suck it up because she needs to learn to let me live my life and let her understand that she needs to be kind to others too.

She immediately calls me a fat ass and a bitch while also crying and screaming while also hitting me hard to the point where at some parts I start bleeding or bruising. All the teachers were dragging her away.

After that I never heard a word of Marie ever again and eventually changed my entire schedule so I wouldn't have any classes with her anymore. But for some reason everyone kept telling me Marie is stalking me outside of school and in the school.

I confronted Marie about it and she said many uncanny things that I don't want to say, but I can tell you they were life threatening and disturbing. I told her if she doesn't stop I will call the cops on her and she will be taken away for good. She said that she was going to take me somewhere dark and scary while I was sleeping.

I felt so creeped out that I confronted my parents about the situation and that they were going to call the principal and the cops on her. I felt so bad and ended crying for hours, potentially begging my parents to not call them. They didn't call the cops but they told the principal which immediately expelled her from the district and the school.

I‘m still in touch with Marie‘s parents and they told me shitty stuff saying that I was the reason that she’s now expelled and in a mental hospital. I eventually blocked them because they kept sending me death threats and shitty stuff. So AITA?",1,1728827660.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

A whipped cream dispenser might just be the game-changing tool your kitchen needs. Not only does it let you top off your treats with fresh, fluffy cream in seconds, but it also opens up a world of culinary creativity—from infused creams to decorative garnishes.

I stumbled upon a fantastic video that explores the top whipped cream dispensers available today. It provides in-depth insights into what makes each one stand out, covering aspects like build quality, ease of use, and unique features that cater to both beginners and seasoned chefs. The video does a great job of breaking down the pros and cons, helping you figure out which dispenser aligns best with your cooking style and needs.

What's really interesting is how the video highlights the versatility of these dispensers. They're not just for whipped cream—you can experiment with mousses, flavored foams, and even cocktails. If you've been looking to elevate your culinary game or simply want to make your desserts look like they came from a high-end restaurant, this is definitely worth a watch.

My name is Mikael, but most call me Mickey(27M) I am moving to the Netherlands in about a year, I'm learning Dutch right now but it's not very good yet. 😅

I understand that a lot of people kinda dislike expats, but I assure you integration is my main goal. I'm leaving my home country mainly bc of cultural differences...The majority of the suffering I experience here is solely bc people are not able to understand how direct, authentic and genuinely compassionate I am. So I did a lot of research to see if there was anywhere in the world I wouldn't feel so foreign. I found the Netherlands. 

Here's a bit about me
- I am studying cyber security and working on a start up rn.
- I love hard style, techno trance, post punk and tons more music. The weirder, moodier or heavier the better. I used to be a metal head but where I live the scene is flooded w racist sexist animals.
-i start everyday w a balanced breakfast of coffee, 2 joints, and a stroopwaffle (even prior to realizing I wanted to de-emmigrate back to my ancestors homeland)
-i have had such a crazy life, I guarantee I'll have a story for any occasion, and there's not a lot of trauma that will scare me away. I learned boundaries and self respect through my journey, I seek to help others find it in theirs.
-i have 2 black cats and one of them is missing an eye (they are super cute)
-i used to work in a medical drug safety testing lab 🧪 
-i used to sword fight in live combat for educational events and renfairs (I have certifications for Germanic longsword)
-i love gaming but I have no friends, 😭 plz game w me 
-i m really short so you can always have an armrest 
-im balanced. Like really balanced. I'm heavily spiritual, but I also love science and biology. I'm ok w staying in and chilling w a few beers or going out and dancing all night. I love learning about computers tech and coding, but I also love hiking and visiting gardens and mycology 
-im a light weight so it's your personal responsibility to fix that w a few beers right? XD nah but I really wanna hang out at a pub w you all! 
-i actually don't mind the tiki thing. A lot of ppl complain, but I'm happy to not owe you anything. Money is just a resource, let me show my gratitude. 
-i am LGBT friendly and I hope you are too. I'm open minded, I assure it it's the least interesting thing about me. Just anticipate this when we eventually meet for the first time when I move. I don't want to mislead anyone, but I hope my content of character means more than how I was born.
-im not easy to offend! Wow! Please tell me exactly how you feel, please for the love of all that is good. Direct and honest communication is seen as confrontational where I live and I'm not an aggressive person. I'm so happy to have someone be honest with me. Pls let me know I look ridiculous, it shows you care. 😂
-i used to play bass in a punk garage band. Nothing serious but if you play, I'd love to jam w you! 

I am so excited to learn more about Dutch culture, practice the language, and I'm already a huge fan of a lot of the music. I recently had to leave behind a lot of old friends in my life bc I realized they weren't on my frequency, so I am looking for folks who I can connect with better. People who will actually respect our friendship.
I have not had a lot of friends growing up bc of the people in my life. It was recently revealed my ""best friend"" was spreading harmful rumors about me to control me...I'm not sure why... But it's not important. 
I'm opening my heart again after losing every connection I had in this country. I'm hoping to start fresh in another country. I'm starting a business, I'm moving w my fiance, life is going to be so good.
I just want you to be apart of it too. I need a best friend again. Someone who actually can handle being around authentic energy. I'm not self absorbed, but my self awareness is spooky to pple w low emotional intelligence... I need stable intelligent compassionate people in my life. If you get it you get it if you don't...well.

I just want to share a little bit about my life over the past year. Maybe some of you can relate or have done something similar to get through tough times, when you felt the need to disappear, to distance yourself from everything familiar. Please share your experiences.



I’m a 29F, and she is 34F. Like many of us, I felt she was ""the one,"" that I could share my life with her. But guess what? No! From my perspective, everything seemed fine in the relationship. We had problems, sure, but nothing that couldn’t be worked out. But again, this was only from my point of view. One day, she broke up with me. It wasn’t a surprise because I already felt her distant. I tried my best to prevent the breakup, but in the end, it was inevitable.

The first five months after that were really difficult. I started feeling rejection to my own house and routine because everything was filled with memories. Simple things like a sofa or a dish would remind me of the home I had tried to build with her. I started feeling the need to disappear, to distance myself from everyone and everything I knew. It felt like no one was helping me, like no one cared. And that’s what I wanted, no one to know anything about me.

I shut down my social media, which had started to overwhelm me too. I didn’t want to keep seeking external validation. I wanted to be off the radar, in every sense.

So I made a decision. I always haved this idea of travelling a lot, but it wasn’t possible with her. She never had the time, the money, or even the desire. And it didn’t feel right to leave my partner behind and travel alone. I felt tied down I felt chained.

So, I decided it was time to finally do all the things I had wanted to do but couldn’t. I decided to take a trip on my own for 8 months. I bought a one-way ticket withoud return. At the beginning, I was really scared. I had never done anything like that before.

My journey began with fear, sadness, and no idea what I was doing. I was leaving behind my family, my friends, and my best friend my dog.

What scared me the most was that I didn’t know how to spend time alone, just with myself. It was really hard at the beginning because I had so many intrusive thoughts about my relationship, questioning what I had done wrong, and the anger and resentment that just wouldn’t go away.

I was never completely alone since I stayed with family members who had emigrated, like my siblings and cousins. But they had their own lives, so while I wasn’t completely alone, I wasn’t always with them either.

I went through many different thoughts, but I always felt a strong rejection toward returning home because I felt like I no longer had a home to return to. What I remembered no longer existed. But, little by little, that began to change.

In the end, I needed to be far away to see things from a different perspective. I needed to prove to myself that I could be alone, that I am independent, self-sufficient, that I don’t need much to live just what fits in a carry-on and a backpack. I learned that there is always someone willing to help, even if it’s just to keep you company, have a cup of coffee, or share their own experiences. I realized that I have all the tools I need to change my mindset, and most importantly, that I can forgive. I learned that other countries aren’t always what they seem. They all have their good and bad sides. Migration is not all roses.

I started to appreciate my family, my friends, the food from my country, and the little things we often take for granted. And I miss my dog so much. Now, as I think about returning, I feel excited and happy.

As for my ex, since the breakup we’ve had no contac, tjust once when I reached out for closure. Now, I no longer feel anger or resentment. This has changed over the last two months. I feel something completely different now. I have a different kind of love for her. I don’t feel the need to interfere in her life. I can send her my best wishes and positive energy from afar and I believe that’s the most authentic way to love someone, without interfering in their life, without seeking any reaction from them.

 Last week was her birthday, but I didn’t text her. I just stayed quiet. Instead, I did something different. I like taking photos, so that day, I went outside to find something meaningful that could represent everything I feel for her. I took the photo and uploaded it to my portfolio, just for me and the people who like my photos. It’s dedicated to her, and it’s my present for her, even if she never gets to see it.

 I’m writing this because the 8 months are almost up. Next week, I’m returning to my country, to my home, and I feel so happy and proud of myself!",4,1728827210.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

If you look to the east in Osaka, you’ll see a small mountain range known as the Ikoma-san-chi. It’s the home of several huge broadcast antennae and the radar tower that gives us the live rain radar maps. Also at the top of Mt. Ikoma is a small theme park. From the city you can see the route of the entire hike which runs from the amusement park along the top ridge of the mountain range toward the south, about 9-10 kilometers. The route is overall down-hill with a 200 meter difference between the trailhead and the trail end, but there are enough ups and downs that there is a total elevation gain (just counting the parts that go up) of 250 meters. So, a hike of low-moderate difficulty, (★★☆☆☆). (Easier than the South Nara hills, but more difficult than the Fukuchiyama Tunnel Hike, if you were there for those.)

We’ll take cable cars to get up and down the mountain. There will be some excellent views of the city. At some points, when the air is clear, you can see Osaka, Kobe, Awajishima, and the Awajishima bridge all at the same time. There is lots of green, mushrooms, some local fauna, but an extra cool thing is to have hiked the ridgeline of the Ikoma mountain range, and pointing it out to your friends when it’s in view from the city. It’s like an omiyage that’s always  there if you look to the east. Maybe that’s just me. 

The 9:30am start will guarantee that even at a mild pace, we’ll be back (I’m guessing 3:30pm) in plenty of time before sundown, just after 5:00pm. 



[This fork in the trail looks like it's from a storybook. We'll be taking the path into the light.  ](https://preview.redd.it/m2i69yb76jud1.jpg?width=2957&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=634ea4c3f969fa936010e76c906745cc4d95108a)

**Where we’ll meet**

This is a station-to-station hike. We’ll finish a long way from the trailhead, so it does not make sense to bring a car or motorcycle. We’ll begin gathering at the [Tori-mae Station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tori-Mae+Station/@34.692398,135.6936193,950m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x600123b8149e1d81:0xb7d4e3438d37080b!8m2!3d34.692398!4d135.6961942!16s%2Fg%2F121vxp1s?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) in Ikoma at 9:00. From there we’ll take the cable car up the mountain. That will cost 500 yen. There is a stop up the mountain at a shrine where we’ll change cable cars to go the final way to the top. Be sure to get the ticket to the Theme park (one way) and not just the Shrine. We should be flashing our ThisIsOsaka! sign, but it’s not a big station and if you see a bunch of foreigners, some holding hiking poles, gathering at the station, that’s probably us. 

We’ll finish up at [Shigi-san-guchi Station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shigisanguchi+Station/@34.6200498,135.6395278,950m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x600126e15d649ebd:0xd48d634bae5b7dff!8m2!3d34.6200498!4d135.6421027!16s%2Fm%2F03cm403?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), a quaint little station where you can take a train back into town. It is definitely a Japan countryside experience. The cable cars are well maintained, but definitely stand out as a part of history. 

**Cost**

We collect no money, as always. There is a fee for the cable car up, and then down the mountain. The cable car up is 500 yen and the cable car down is just a bit more than that. 

**Clothes and Gear**

There are a few places where the trail is a bit overgrown and we’ll be wading through knee-deep grass, so I suggest long pants. Long-sleeve shirts are also probably a good idea. Hiking boots 🥾 are a good idea, but running shoes and court shoes will do. A hat is always good. I saw people on the trail with and without poles. I am a devoted quadruped and I’ll bring poles for people who want them (first come first serve). Send me a note to reserve a pair in advance. Judge the weather on the day, but it is usually a good idea to have a windbreaker and fleece you can add or remove. Expect it to be a few degrees cooler than what it is in the city. 

Water is a must. One to two liters is recommended. I am not aware of a water source after we leave the amusement park. 

I didn’t run into bugs when I did a trail run of the hike, but bug spray is always smart. 

**Food**

You should be able to find something at a convenience store in the neighborhood of Tori-mae Station, but it is usually a good idea to bring something from downtown if you can. As mentioned, we’ll stop for a while and eat lunch. Be prepared to pack out whatever trash you pack in. There is nowhere to dispose of trash. 

**Who we tend to be**

Expect a group of people from all over the world of all ages, but most people who join tend to be in their twenties and thirties. Everyone is welcome. Kids are welcome, but be sure they are old enough and sturdy enough to handle a nearly 10k hike with some incline. Among the crew, we have those who stay back with anyone who moves at a slower pace, so don’t let that be a concern. 

**Weather**

We’ll give weather reports as we get closer to the hiking day. If we need to cancel because of rain, we will post that as soon as we can and inform everyone of any alternate rainy day activities that we might think of. I never hope for a hike being rained out, but we have some cool next-generation board games I’d love to have an excuse to break out. 

At the moment the 20th is expected to be coolish with a high between 16°C and 20°C, partly sunny with a low chance of rain. The day before may have rain in the morning so keep that in mind for footwear. These things change, so check back.

**After the hike**

Last time, I had so much fun talking and chilling out over coffee and deserts with everyone, so I’m now looking for a place to do that again. The neighborhood where we end is rather devoid of places that seem appropriate, but we’ll see.

--------

It was around 9pm when I heard the front door click open. I couldn’t recall what was happening on the TV screen, though I didn’t dare divert my eyes from it.  

Dodge’s heavy boots sounded down the hallway accompanied by the jingle of his keys; a sound I had come accustomed to. His large, broad frame finally appeared in the doorway, and I snuggled into my position a bit more. Just seeing him brought a wave of calm over me. The constant anxiety that usually hums through me settling in a way that felt foreign. His large frame moved through the room in the effortless way he does, steady and reassuring. Why is it that just his presence can turn the noise in my head to silence? I thought about my life before I came to Riversend. With Aaron there was a constant tension that didn’t seem to fade. I’d lay in bed at night just waiting to hear him come home, bracing myself for the familiar shift of him settling into bed beside me. 

“Hey,” he interrupted. Putting his keys onto the counter, he made his way towards the kitchen. 

“Hey,” I replied, voice softer than intended. The scent of his cologne wafted past me. My body unconsciously relaxed knowing he was home, and I felt my attention drifting between the movie and the sounds emitting from the kitchen.  

“What are you watching?” his voice came from behind the couch. He stood spooning up big mouthfuls of the pasta I had made earlier. I tried to hold back my smile; happy he was enjoying the food I made.  

“The Notebook. Have you seen it before?” glancing back, I half expected to see a look of disdain on his face. 

His eyebrows shot up. Right. Of course, he hadn’t seen it, Dodge was a 38-year-old ex-Navy SEAL, not the type to lose himself in a rom-com. 

Surprisingly, he moved around the side of the couch and plopped down beside me, his frame engulfing most of it. I could feel the warmth radiating between us only a hairs breath separating our bodies. 

“So, he wants to go out with her and she’s too good for him?” he asks as Ryan goslings character hangs off the Ferris wheel. 

“Uh huh,” I nod my head. His cologne mixed with his own scent was stronger now, a blend that sent my thoughts spiraling. We were so close I couldn’t help feeling the urge to scoot over and inhale further. But before I let my inner voice win, I had a rational thought. I realized how creepy that would be. I stayed put. 

He finished his meal, placing the dish on the coffee table and sinking back further into the couch. I turned my head to look at him. He was enjoying the movie, I smiled at that. The big gruff man who acts all tough likes romance movies.  

“What?” I’d been caught. He turned to me, his face blank, but I still grinned.  

“You like it?”  

“It’s okay.” he stated.  

“Good.” knowing he would only subject himself to sitting here if he was enjoying the movie.  

“Popcorn?” pulling the bowl from my side of the couch and holding it out in offer.  

“Thanks,” he surprised me by taking the bowl scooting closer and placing it into his lap, throwing some pieces into his mouth.  

The heat between our bodies permeated. I was suddenly aware of my short pajamas. The bare skin of my thigh rested lightly against his own in my cross-legged position and I fought the urge to move closer. I scolded myself. Relax Ly, this is Dodge, he’s not even remotely interested, don’t get yourself worked up over nothing. Grabbing a handful popcorn, I shoved a bunch in my mouth, in an attempt to pacify my thoughts. Taking a breath, I turned my attention back to the movie. 

Minutes passed. The heat from his body gently warmed me, and I felt my eyes go heavy with sleep. 

I felt Dodge shuffle reclining further into the couch, so that my head rested on his shoulder, comforting, and yet alarming all at once. When I felt his arm slip around me drawing nearer, his warmth enveloped me like a cocoon. 

The warmth surrounding me was like a soft blanket, and for the first time in what felt like a long time, I allowed myself to sink into that comfort. Nestled next to dodge I felt safe, a haven from the shadows of the past, like nothing could touch me here, next to him. I knew that I could trust him in that moment, and I decided I would, even if just for a short while. 

Eyes half open, I trained my attention towards the TV, remaining still, worried one movement might scare him away, like he didn’t know what was happening and if either of us moved or spoke, the spell would be broken. So, I stayed still as long as I could, enveloped in his warmth. ",1,1728826461.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

End of May i met a guy when i was on vacation through tinder. I was on vacation he swiped me, and then i returned to my country and i matched him. We started talking and, he realised i was living in another country but we kept talking. Every day. After 20 or something days we decided to meet somewhere in between. We already had a bunch of deep conversations and we really connected. ( I live in German, he lives in Netherlands.) Our first date, was the best date of my life. His also. We stayed together in a hotel. Came back the next day. It had romance, great laghs, we ate, talked a lot and in the end also great sex. Next morning, we went for a ride, then for coffee and then we returned home. The connection we had in every area, i think not many people meet that in their lifes. I was always 100% myself, and he was also. We kept talking everyday and we met around once a week for almost 3 months. Then i went on vacation to my homeland and we didn't meet for 3 weeks. I understood there that i was really missing him. I was falling for him so hard and fast. I came back, we met. Even when I couldn't have sex, we met. He started something personal stuff with his apartment and got busy. Still, he always included me to his decisions and we never stopped talking. After a while I started freaking out because of the distance. One day we met, had a great date and the next morning i told him everything. That i was in love, i miss him everyday and that we should stop meeting before it gets ugly. He told me he doesn't want, but its realistic and if that's what's best for me, okay! I couldn't go through with it though. 5 days later i told him that i would like to give it a try no matter how it turns out! He agreed. 2 weeks after, we met. All these days, he also started a process on buying a house. So he was pretty broke. Me also. But we were managing. On our last date, we started talking about me freaking out, us generally dating other people. He told me that this is going to get ugly and we're going to freak out with the distance! Head back to the hotel. He almost had a panick attack that night. We went out for a smoke to calm down. At some point he turned and told me we should stop meeting indeed. We're already developing feelings, we need more of eachother in the day. That's not enough. It was like we were in a relationship, but we were not, but we wanted!! And one of us must change completely his life for this to work and we're not there. Neither of us. We're in a weird place in our lives. We talked a lot, said all the truths, expressed our feelings. We are lucky we had something like that. We went back to the hotel, he was holding me all night. We slept, woke up around 5. He kept holding me tight until it was time to leave. We were planning before that to spend Christmas together, go on trips and do many things.Its been almost 2 weeks now. I feel a bit liberated, leaving a situation that would possibly drive me crazy but i miss him so much. It's like something is missing from my life. I feel empty. I don't want to date another guy, not even meet one and i don't want to forget him. I don't think I'll even have that kind of a connection again. It's also the same for him! 
And I'm asking now... He also told me I've had a great impact in his life and affected him in many ways. And made him love himself even more.  Are we too stupid for leaving something like that so we won't hate eachother in the end or too realistic??  ",1,1728826335.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False

I'm nowhere near the level of sophistication of most on this sub, but what I do get now is consistent, and generally consistently good, coffee - whether with a flavor & cold froth, or black. (The flavor & cold froth is with my daily drive of whatever small lot light to medium roast Trader Joe's has. My other coffees are for special cups.)

Near as I can tell, in the doc Zampa uses a Hario scale, Commandante grinder and a V60.

We're a couple of old(er) blue belts who started at 33 and 36 (not a real couple, although we cuddle on a regular, weekly basis) and fell hopelessly in love with this sport and everything around it.

We had the early midlife idea to do more in BJJ since, besides competition, the community aspect is so wholesome (violins in the background).

In our enthusiasm, we started a webshop, which obviously is way more work then our impulsive asses imagined.

We wanted to start with rashguards (like everyone does), but then saw a fitness mug on the podcast of our BJJ friend Lex Fridman, got even more enthusiastic, and decided to pivot to a giftshop

Yes, there already a lot of gifts out there on the web. What we're missing, and what we're looking forward to do, is the mentioned community aspect. This should be made central.

Our idea right now is in twofold:

1. Besides our own designs, we want to make community sourced designs. Ie. your design on everybody's sweaty chest or coffee mug
2. We want to donate minimally 5% of our net profits to a yearly BJJ related charity, chosen together by us and the community. For this year we have one in mind, but we're open to suggestions

A lot of big dreams to expand on this, but for now we're trying to reign in our impulsiveness and try to kick it off first. We want to launch end of this month, Christmas is coming.

What do you guys think? Feel free to roast!

If you like it, and you know a charity, feel free to share. Design ideas? All ears.

Gluten: I have a level of gluten sensitivity based on IgE testing but not gluten intolerance, allergy or celiac disease. I don't think all sources of gluten are equally bad. For instance wholegrain bread and spinash wraps don't make me feel as bad as white bread, pitas, pizza or pasta.

Nightshades (tomatoes, eggplant, potatoes and peppers). Not sure what everyone have to say about those? Seems like mixed results for people.

I absolutely love music - whether it's playing guitar, spinning vinyl (I love collecting and listening to records), or going to concerts. It'd be great to find a more concert friends! Let me know what upcoming concerts you're going to!
I also love spending time outside with my dog. He's got a cute outdoorsy name but you'll have to message me to find out what it is haha. We go on all sorts of adventures running, hiking, camping, paddle boarding, and hammocking.
Recently I've been getting more into coffee and I think it'd be super fun to have someone to share a virtual coffee/tea with almost daily if time allows and the interest is there. I don't have to work until 9:00 AM most days and I get up early and usually just listen to one side of a record before heading to work. But it'd be fun to spend that time having a nice morning chat with someone while we sip on our drinks.
I know that physical attraction is important and I'm happy to exchange photos early-on to determine if there's mutual physical attraction.

Judo is the one that I teach professionally, and coincidentally it’s one of the worst activities that someone with AS could do. A high level coach is running a clinic a couple of hours away today and I bought a ticket months ago, but within a few moments of getting up I knew that I shouldn’t go. We had a visiting instructor at our dojo yesterday and I participated. During the warmups I noticed an increase and a different quality of pain in my left hip (which has been a growing problem area), but went ahead and participated anyway. So today I know that going to the clinic will almost certainly result in missing a couple days of work and being laid up in a bathtub all day. 

The temptation is to take some pain meds and go, but I just have no interest in any of the likely outcomes- sitting on the floor and watching for 4 hours after being in a car 2 hours both ways; constantly trying to explain to partners who don’t know me that I’m broken and to be cautious; working with lower level people but being frustrated the whole time at what I *could be* doing; being preoccupied that people think I’m loaded on drugs (which is correct but not how they’d think); being preoccupied that people think I’m one of those guys who didn’t really earn his black belt and just sits around and avoids the training, etc. I had some of the latter at yesterday’s class; I was taking things as easy as possible and just didn’t want to have to explain my situation to the guest instructor. Even so I ended up taking a bunch of falls for my students and I’m paying for it today. I used to be able to take abuse like a honey badger and shrug it off.  Now I’m acutely aware that I just recently lost nearly a week of work from medication issues, am on the verge of a flare, and can’t afford to lose more time from pushing things over the edge today.

This morning I find myself disappointed but not giving much of a f**k otherwise, which is new for me. I expected to be irritated or mad about it but I’m not. Is it resignation? Maturity finally kicking in? Acceptance and letting go of aspects of the old life?

But what pisses me off is that popular culture is adapting and co-opting anime culture and concepts without giving it it's due credit. 
Case in my point- the term ""Slice of Life"". 
Everyone has started using this term and have taken it out of context from the actual genre/storytelling tool it was. From reviewers to influencers to marketing people who want to sell merch or big mefia houses. People have associates this term with either media that depicted mundane life of characters in a story or like a low stakes personal story at best or cosy comforting, ""girlie"" aesthetics with fucking coffee and cafes and day-in-my-life vlogs with no substance. It's a disgrace to all anime and manga lovers of all genders. Infantalising women who love anime culture is really disrespectful. Identities are limited to certain labels only.
Even more infuriating is that okay, now that you've used this term and bastardised its meaning labeling everything ""girlie, cutesie"" as slice of life, the least you could do is give the anime lovers some credit. We have been watching and appreciating this genre with it's unique storytelling ideas for decades and suddenly post 2020 this term for widely popular and for the wrong reasons. Ofc much of that was attributed to anime that released in 2020 and after. But it was the short form content that followed on social media during the lockdowns that popularized it. Things that were depicted in slice of life anime are mostly centred around a house and daily living tasks, so the reels doing the same started to fill our feed. People making bread and asmr of food and laundry and all that nonsense. It got worse when the meaning of the term slice of life was stretched and ofc the marketing assholes jumped on the bandwagon and now everything that was remotely calming is now a slice of life ""aesthetic"". The aestheticization of simple fucking things and making it into a style is the worst thing this generation is accused of. Beyond this, the term got adopted into mainstream literature. In book and movie reviews and video essays and stuff. But the real meaning was never explored. Even people who make youtube vids and reels explainers about this are also so fucking dumb, no reading no history nothing. Hours of videos and not once they credit the popularity of the term to anime viewers and early 2000s anime which featured the actual slice of life method of storytelling. It is not limited to just cute girls doing cute things as some asshole writer on quora wrote, that the term is an american invention. IT IS NOT.  Its origins in media are credited to french. Those slice of life anime were different to what ever bullshit is being called slice of life today, esp in India. Mindless hoardes of people just pissing me off. 
So yeah sorry for this rant but if you feel the same how some ideas, concepts, styles and straight up plot points were lifted from anime without giving them their due credit and still continued ostracisation of anime lovers please tell me more of these things in comments.

He and my mother divorced when I was 11. It birth a lot, but he was still involved. He would come for his weekends and spend time with my brother and I. When I was a teenager he met his now ex-wife and basically fell off the face of the earth to his children for his new young play thing. Well she left him in May of ‘23 and who did he rely heavily on? His dutiful daughter.

Then he started rekindling a relationship with my mother. 

And then he hurt me again. And well my mom. He went and started dating a woman and has made that his priority. This after talking about reuniting our family and us all living together again. My mom and I own a house together and he wanted to move back to our home state and move in with us. He just forgot to tell me when he changed his mind.


Between September and October he has been in my state twice and not so much as a phone call to say hi and see if I wanted to meet up for a coffee. I’ve checked with my Aunt and it’s the same issue there. The thing is he did this for twenty years with his ex-wife. He hasn’t called me back since the beginning of September, even though I’ve called him. And even the phone calls were rushed before then. You would think for a man who has already buried one child he would want to keep up with his remaining child. Why do they do this? I know my father can’t be alone. It’s a flaw he has. But he has once again abandoned me. And I know it shouldn’t sure so much since I am an adult, but he is very fond of reminding me how small our family is and how little time we really have together.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

Yonder is a lifestyle credit card which provides points to spend on ‘experiences’ such as restaurant meals, flights, coffee, flowers, delivery food services, trips away (such as log cabins and Wellness retreats) and much more - **it changes every month**!

If you sign up via my referral link (here: [https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx](https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx)) you will get 10,000 points (worth approximately **£50 in credit** towards various experiences, dependent on experience chosen, in cities of London, Manchester, Birmingham Bristol and Bath, or towards the **online experiences** such as flights - therefore can be used in any city, no matter where you live!).

On top of this, some other perks of the card and referral include:

* you will be able to claim 3 months *premium* membership for **free** which provides **worldwide family travel insurance** when booking travel on the card and also 5 points per £1 spent.
* From my rough calculations, this correlates to somewhere in the region of 2 to 3% cash back dependent on the experience
* You’ll also be able to get Mastercard foreign exchange fees (i.e essentially the best fees you can get when abroad, akin to cards like Chase/Monzo/Revolut) and purchase protection.

To sign up, you can go through the referral link (or any referral link!) and follow the steps. They will run a soft credit check to determine if you’re eligible and then if so will run a hard check as with all credit cards to determine your credit allowance (but only after running the soft check to tell you if you meet their eligibility requirements).

You can also cancel before the 3 months premium ends to avoid the subscription renewing and once you’ve spent all the points on experiences, and switch to a free card or just cancel the card.

On the whole I’m really enjoying Yonder and hope you will too! I’m enjoying so much so that I’m I've continued using the subscription after my first 3 months premium free (and I also use it on top of my AMEX). The nice thing is it tends to be **accepted everywhere** that AMEX is not (because it's Mastercard) and you can spend abroad without a transaction fee.

I woke up at 5:30 am and started the morning off with a coffee. It's pretty tough for most to wake up this early just to commute, but I have to endure it and build up tolerance to this. Due to the nature of waking up early, I found myself struggling to keep my eyes peeled/open at work sometimes.

Around 12 pm, I was outside the company's building; fulfilling my duty at the ground floor. All of a sudden, my phone rang, and I answered. Turns out It was my gf calling me saying "" hey did you see me at all?I'm staring at you from a distance, observating you!""

Dude, she passed by the building intentionally just to check me out holyshit. I had to turn around to see her located at the opposite of the street. I winded up having a phone call from far away with her for 10 mins since she doesn't want my coworker to notice her at all. It was really sweet and cute. 

She even waited me to have lunch afterward, reading books at the store for a hour, and i was like sorry to keep you waiting lol. The end",1,1728824161.0,WriteStreakEN,2,1.0,False

All week, before the anticipated event, Hana fretted over what gift she should get for his parents, especially one that would win the mother’s approval. Though Jeong-wook insisted it wasn’t necessary, she felt compelled to do it. She wanted the first meeting to go off without a hitch, and she believed that presenting a gift to her future in-laws would set the right tone and make a positive impression.

But what could she possibly give to a wealthy family? How could she win over people who already had everything? These questions burned in Hana’s mind, keeping her awake from midnight until morning as she tirelessly searched through online lists of gift ideas. Yet, nothing seemed to be good enough. The few rare items that caught her attention were simply unaffordable for her.

“Fruits!” her mother suggested on the eve of the event.

They were strolling through the open-air market passing by several vendors selling assorted fruits. Hana, on the brink of tears, continued to search through items on her phone with a sense of desperation, hoping to find something that could be delivered first thing in the morning.

Hana raised a brow. “Fruits?” she repeated, incredulously.

Her mother nodded.

“B-but just fruits?” Hana sputtered. “Unless they were sprinkled with gold flakes, I don’t think Jeong-wook’s parents would be too impressed.” Then the tarot reader’s Judgment card came to mind, suddenly twisting her insides.

“A gift shouldn’t be about the price. It’s the intention behind it that matters. Fruits are a gift all could enjoy.”

Sighing, Hana scanned the fruit stands, feeling unsatisfied with the choices. Then, her eyes laid on a stack of gift boxes of Asian pears. She plucked one up. It was as round and large as a baby’s head. Its golden skin shone in the sunlight.

“You could never go wrong with fruit,” her mother said.

After purchasing a dozen pears, Hana began to pack for the weekend, picking out the best outfits she had in the closet. Her family was high on excitement and pride. Every now and then, they told her how thrilled they were that she had found “The One.”

But Yoo-jin, her best friend since childhood, was less than enthusiastic. “Eonni, you need to be careful,” Yoo-jin warned her over the phone.

Hana laughed. “I’m sure his family isn’t that bad. Look at how they had raised Jeong-wook! He’s the kindest and most thoughtful man I’ve ever been with.”

“Is he? Do you really know him?”

“Well, of course! We’ve been together for six months.”

“People from that class, like him, they’re…”

“They’re what?” Hana felt a rush of irritation as she listened to her friend’s judgment.

“They’re not like us.”

“What do you mean?”

“What I mean is that they live in a far different plane of reality than we do,” Yoo-jin’s voice was cautious, even frightened. “We see how things are, but they see how they want things to be, and they won’t stop until they get what they want.”

“I think that’s how they became successful. If anything, it’s admirable, even inspiring!”

“Eonni! Listen to what I’m saying.” Yoo-jin then paused for a moment, taking in a sharp breath, and said in a much calmer voice, “It could be dangerous to involve yourself with them, especially with this family.”

“Dangerous?”

“I’ve met people like Jeong-wook and their families here in this city. I’ve seen what they’re really like, and what they really look like. They’re not...people.”

“Oh, Yoo-jin, you’re being ridiculous now!”

“I’m telling you that you’re walking into a trap!”

Hana scoffed. She couldn’t believe what she was hearing. With a firm readiness to end the call, she gawked at her phone in disbelief as if it were Yoo-jin in front of her.

“Eonni?”

“Can’t you just be happy for me?” Hana spat. “You get to live your dream in Seoul, while I’m stuck here! This is the one good thing that’s happened to my life in years! And everyone’s happy for me except for the one person I thought would be the happiest! I thought it would be you!”

“I—I…” Yoo-jin stammered.

Then, without hesitation, Hana ended the call. But as she sat in silence, a queasy feeling lingered in the pit of her stomach. She couldn’t help but wonder: do I really know him?

XXXXX 

A loud knock at the front door abruptly awakened the Gwak household. The sun had barely risen, and Hana couldn’t help but wonder who could be so inconsiderate as to disturb them at such an early hour. In a drowsy state, she joined her parents and grandmother as they made their way to the front door. When her father opened it, they were warmly greeted by a man dressed in a chauffeur’s uniform, wearing a cheerful expression.

“Annyeonghaseyo!” the man said, lifting his hat and bowing his head. “I’m here to drive the young Miss to the Roh family’s estate.”

Hana’s heart sank in disappointment. She had been looking forward to seeing her boyfriend all week. “But Jeong-wook told me—” she started to say.

“Yes,” the chauffeur cut her off, “he was going to come get you himself. However, another matter came up, and so his mother sent me instead.”

He checked his pocket watch and frantically urged her to get her bags and hurry. 

“We need to go now; it’s important that we’re not late!”

Hana hurriedly dressed and gathered her belongings, feeling rushed and unable to even say goodbye to her family with a kiss. Within five minutes, she was out the door, following the chauffeur to the waiting SUV in the parking lot. The chauffeur, although friendly and courteous, spoke very little, focusing on opening and closing the door for her and even offering a peppermint candy. Lost in her own thoughts and fantasies, Hana didn’t mind the prolonged silence.

Hana gazed out the window, envisioning every detail of her arrival at the Roh family’s house. First, she would bow deeply, showing utmost respect, rather than simply nodding her head. Then, she would present Jeong-wook’s parents with the gift box of Asian pears, carefully chosen as her offering.

Her stomach fluttered with nervous anticipation as she imagined their reaction. Hana held onto the hope that her mother was right—that fruits would be a gift that everyone could enjoy. But she thought that once his parents saw the kindness of her heart and the depth of her love for their only son, they’d embrace her as a part of their family.

The chauffeur pulled into a rest stop, announcing a quick smoke break. His demeanor seemed tense and nervous. He tried to placate with a cigarette. Hana didn’t find this behavior unusual; many people she knew who worked under pressure often sought solace in smoking. It was a common sight to witness them pacing restlessly in office building parking lots, surrounded by wispy clouds of smoke.

She’d see them from the third-floor window of her math academy. Sometimes she had to shut the window because the smell made her light-headed. She couldn’t completely blame them for the nasty habit of smoking; it was one of the few things that soothed them, even if only for just five minutes.

As the chauffeur continued to smoke and mutter to himself, Hana decided to step out of the car. She perused the various food stands and coffee shops and the clothing stores that mostly offered popular hiking gear and hats. Then, someone caught her eye. A woman sitting by the window in a coffee shop seemed oddly familiar. As Hana approached closer, the woman’s face came into clearer view, and then it struck her. It was the tarot reader.

The woman, sensing Hana’s gaze, looked up and their eyes met. Her eyebrows raised in surprise, and Hana felt a tinge of embarrassment at being caught staring. She quickly composed herself, offering a polite smile and bowing her head. Before she knew it, Hana found herself seated across from the tarot reader, feeling slightly embarrassed that she couldn’t recall the woman’s name. Seeing that the tarot reader appeared to be around the same age as her mother, Hana addressed her as “ajumeoni” out of respect.
“Well, it’s a pleasant surprise to see you here!” The tarot reader smiled, spreading a sense of motherly warmth that Hana found comforting, quietly easing Hana’s anxiety about meeting Jeong-wook’s family.

Hana nodded. “Likewise! Ajumeoni, I want to apologize for how I was in our first meeting. I was a bit rude and sour. My grandmother and mother were always pushing me about marriage, and I was upset that they dragged me to do the tarot reading without letting me know their intention.”

The reader waved her hand dismissively and chuckled. “Oh, don’t worry about it. You wouldn’t be the first one. So many mothers and grandmothers come to me asking about their son’s or daughter’s future—always about marriage, babies, and careers.”

“I also want to say thank you, too.”

“What for?”

“I remember that the Lovers card came up in the reading. You were right. I met someone, and I wasn’t even looking… it just happened. Perhaps, it was fate. I honestly feel that he’s the one.”

“Ah, yes, now I do recall that card! Well, I’m happy for you that things seem to be working out.”

“It is! I’m on my way to meet his family for the first time, and I’ve been feeling nervous about it too.

“Just remember what I told you…Whatever they say or do, don’t let it get to you, don’t lose your sense of self-worth. You may need to firmly put your foot down with them.”

She placed a tender hand over Hana’s hands as they unconsciously crumpled and tore away at the small pieces of a napkin. “I’m sure your meeting with his family will go well,” she added. “I don’t mean to make you even more anxious, but I say this to most of my clients because people tend to overly romanticize their partners, and when the truth finally reveals itself, they’re crushed. It’s difficult to see someone so heartbroken.”

Hana straightened up in her seat and forced a smile, quietly telling herself that the reader was wrong and that the cards were a silly thing. “You’re right on that too. I’ll be careful as I can be.”

The reader reached into her purse and pulled out the deck of cards. “How about a reading for your journey?” she asked, shuffling the cards like an expert casino dealer. “Free of charge. Just something to ease your mind.”

Before Hana could respond, a loud bang on the window startled both of them, causing some of the tarot cards to slip from the reader’s hands and fall to the floor. Looking outside, they saw the chauffeur with a frantic expression on his face, pressing it against the window. He pointed at his watch and gestured for Hana to hurry.

As they made their way back to the vehicle, Hana struggled to keep up with the chauffeur, who walked with hurried, large strides and was muttering to himself about their lateness, and that the Mother was going to have his head for supper.

“You must be getting hungry,” the chauffeur said, suddenly breaking his long silence, and glancing over at her through the rearview mirror. “It’s going to be a long trip to the Roh house. You might want to eat the candy to stave off your hunger.”

“Oh, well, I’m okay. I can hold out. The drive to Seoul isn’t too long for me.”

“Seoul? Oh, the Roh estate isn’t in Seoul. It’s much farther than that.”

“But Jeong-wook told me—” she stopped herself as she just remembered that her boyfriend had never mentioned where his family lived. She had always assumed it was in Seoul. That was where everything was, and anybody who was anybody lived in Korea’s largest bustling capital city.

“If we’re not heading to the city, then where are you taking me?” she asked.

“I’m not allowed to say. But you should have something to eat. It’s a long drive. Do you not like peppermint? I’ve got other flavors.”

Keeping one hand on the steering wheel, the chauffeur reached over to the glove compartment with the other hand. Inside, the compartment was filled with an assortment of hard candies, each of them a different color and flavor. He extended his hand, offering a handful of them to Hana.

“There’s orange, grapefruit, blueberry,” he listed off the flavors and urged her to take one.

Hana tensed up, unsure of how to respond. Seeing that she wasn’t going to take any candies, the chauffeur let out a sigh of frustration. He tossed them back into the glove compartment and slammed it shut.

1g2oyrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1g2oyrv/book_review_monstrous_regiment_discworld_31_by/,Book Review: Monstrous Regiment (Discworld #31) by Terry Pratchett,"Borogravia is a minor but bellicose country, with a long history of invading its neighbours under the pretext of religious commands given by the deity Nuggan. With Nuggan's commands becoming more unhinged (banning ginger hair, garlic, cats, jigsaw puzzles and the colour blue), the reasons for war become increasingly random as well. Its neighbours, finally fed up by its constant aggression, have joined with the regional superpower of Ankh-Morpork to finally end the threat once and for all.

With war raging - or shambolically bumbling around - bar worker Polly Perks decides to go searching for her missing brother. She poses as a man to join the army and is assigned to a new regiment, only to find out almost the entire company has had the same idea. With women doing men's work also deemed an Abomination Unto Nuggan, the regiment has to keep their heads down, infiltrate an enemy keep, and work out how to rescue/escape their assorted family members, and, if possible, end the war before it causes any more damage.

Throughout his prolific career, Sir Terry Pratchett had a knack for using his witty dialogue, sharp prose and keen knowledge of history and culture to explore many different concepts. In most cases, he produced a brilliant **Discworld** book exploring a certain idea, like the press or the dangers of fundamentalist religion. But, when he turned his attention to the idea of war, he uncharacteristically dropped the ball. *Jingo* was perfectly okay, but lacked his trademark intelligence and depth.

Ten books later, he decided to give it another go, and this time nailed it. If *Jingo* was about the superficialities of going to war for absolutely no sane reason, *Monstrous Regiment* is about war as a much more complex force. Here we have burned-out homesteads, villages standing amidst salted fields and people's homes being invaded for reasons they don't really understand. Borogravia is fighting a defensive war against invaders, but it's also been a bellicose lunatic in the past, and is being flattened under the weight of the abuse heaped upon it by its own rulers. This creates a complex stew of ideas and themes, which is where Pratchett is at his best.

Polly and her fellow soldiers have little interest in the greater geopolitical complexities of the war, instead just trying to rescue individual people from the maelstrom. But, thanks to a chance encounter with newspaper reporter William de Worde (cameoing from *The Truth*), their mission inadvertently becomes famous across half the continent, and takes on a grander importance. It's also symbolic of the losses Borogravia has suffered, where an entire regiment is made up of women because there's increasingly few men left able to fight.

As in his best, most cutting books, Pratchett remembers to keep the funny: the regiment consists of an assortment of funny characters, the most memorable being Maladict, a suave, reformed vampire who has sworn off blood but developed an equally crippling addiction to coffee. But there's an undercurrent of seriousness here that is powerful: more than a few of the recruits have been victimised, and how they deal with trauma is a subtle but constant theme of the book. Sergeant Jackrum also emerges as one of Pratchett's most fascinating characters, a counterpoint of his more familiar Commander Vimes (who has a few brief appearances in the novel as an Ankh-Morpork liaison) who went down a decidedly more disturbing path (with more than a whiff of Life on Mars' Gene Hunt to them as well, for good and ill).

The book unfolds with a very deliberate pace: at just under 500 pages this is one of the longest **Discworld** novels but it earns its length by dividing the narrative into several distinct sections as the mission unfolds, as well as the larger-than-normal cast giving Pratchett a lot of characters to develop. But this also gives the book the feel of holding a stick of dynamite that's about to go off. Pratchett is known for being funny but he is absolutely at his best when he is angry, and I get the distinct impression as he wrote the book and continued researching things like the treatment of people in war, especially women and ""non-conformists,"" he got progressively angrier. By the time the book concludes, the humour is so laced with white-hot rage that it is positively acidic. But Pratchett also never loses control. He doesn't go into some lecturing rant (a weakness some of his other books suffer from) and he never dissipates the focus on the story or characters.

*Monstrous Regiment* (\*\*\*\*\*) is Pratchett's take on war - actual, messy, horribly murky war - and gender and politics. It's a long book, by his standards, but he maintains the pacing and tension to deliver one of his finest and most thought-provoking novels.",12,1728823920.0,Fantasy,2,0.93,False

1g2os4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1g2os4z/apartment_for_rent_enquire_within/,Apartment for rent. Enquire within!,"I always liked having my own space. I’d had my fair share of experience with cramped dorms and messy, inconsiderate roommates. It wasn’t for me. So when I found a small, ground-floor apartment near campus, I didn’t hesitate. It wasn’t fancy, but it had everything I needed. Quiet, private, and fairly cheap—perfect for my last year of university.



Everything was good—until the neighbors started complaining.



It began with Mrs. Reed from next door, catching me in the hallway one morning. She looked tired, her eyes heavy with bags.



“Elizabeth, are you having late-night parties?” she asked, her voice sharper than usual.



I blinked, confused. “*No?* I go to bed at 10.”



She shook her head, a deep frown settling into her jowls. “I hear music. Laughing, banging on the walls. You should be more considerate.”



I hadn’t heard a thing. “I’m sorry, but it’s not me. I promise.”



She squinted at me like she didn’t believe a word I said. *“Just keep it down.”*



Nights were quiet on my end. I didn’t throw parties or invite friends over, I’m a bit of a recluse, honestly. I barely left the apartment, aside from classes or library runs. Still, the complaints didn’t stop. More neighbors started approaching me in the hallways, their faces drawn and annoyed, asking about the noise. To keep it down. 



The thing is though, every night I slept like a rock. **Nothing** woke me up. **Nothing** ever stirred. I tried staying up one night to catch the sound, but I was too exhausted. I wasn’t going to sacrifice my sleep for something I *knew* I wasn’t contributing to, so I passed out around 11p.m. with no disturbances. 



One evening, after a long day of studying at the library, I came home to find a note slipped under the door. It was crumpled and hastily written: “Noise complaints. Handle it.” Next to it, bizarrely enough, was a chocolate bar wrapper. A small amount of slick, melted chocolate still inside. The letter itself smeared in it. 



I was pissed tbh. *What the hell?* It wasn’t even me making the noise, and *why?* Why stuff your own trash along with the letter?  Frustrated and tired, I tossed the note on the counter and the wrapper in the trash. Then, I collapsed into bed and fell into a study-induced coma.



That was the night things started going missing.



At first, it was small stuff—pens, keys, a sock here or there. The usual, nothing suspicious. They always turned up, but never where I left them. I figured it was stress; finals were around the corner, and I was so drowsy all the time. I chalked it up to forgetfulness.



Then one morning, I found my toothbrush sitting on the coffee table. It was damp, *tinged brown.* The odd thing? I hadn’t brushed my teeth yet. I knew I hadn’t. I still had morning breath. 



I started to wonder if I was sleepwalking. Could I have been getting up in the middle of the night, moving things without realizing it? Making loud noises? I considered having a friend stay over to keep an eye on me, but that felt… extreme? 



I finally got my answer a week later, at a point where I was being threatened with eviction due to these unexplained noise complaints. I noticed a panel in the base of my closet was... ajar? I froze. The base always looked solid before, nothing loose. Curiosity got the better of me, sliding it open some more and being met with a stale, cool breeze rising up from below. Stupid I know, but I peaked my head in, discovering a crawlspace. 



It couldn’t be more than three feet high, dank and covered in thick dusty cobwebs. Scattered throughout the space were chocolate bar wrappers. It smelt like mould and *sickly sweetness.*



I guess I was naive. I assumed I’d find some wily raccoons, a stray cat. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and peered further in. There were several cushions steeped in mould, discarded soda cans, more chocolate bar wrappers. It smelt of sugar and rank air. No scratching, no animal sounds.



But deeper into the darkness, *I saw them.* Four pairs of eyes, squinting from the light I brought in with me. As my eyes settled. I realised what was staring back at me. 



Two children sat cross-legged on the floor. They were pale, gaunt, with dark circles under their eyes. But their knees rocked with giddy excitement, their smiles smeared with chocolate. The boy let out a small giggle as his eyes met mine. 



Slumped against the left side was a woman. Her face was blank, her eyes unfocused. Staring at everything; and nothing, in particular. 



And in the far corner, drenched in darkness, was a man. Hunched on all fours, watching me intently with a calm expression. 



*“You’re finally here,”* his voice was soft, with a hint of malice. 



He gestured toward the children, who were still giggling.  *“The kids love playing at night. Apologies, they can get a little loud.”*



He smirked. A small, controlled smile. From his pocket he revealed a tiny glass bottle. *“I’ve been helping you though. You’re a sound sleeper when you’re… properly dosed.”*



My blood ran cold as the cramped, rank space I peaked my head into began to spin. “...You’ve been drugging me?” 



He shrugged, nonchalant, then gestured toward the woman slumped in the corner. “My wife doesn’t talk much these days, but she enjoys the company.”



The woman didn’t react to being addressed. 



Something cold brushed against my hand. The little girl was crouched next to me, her fingers icy as she tugged at my fingers. Her eyes were wide as she stared up at me, her smile never fading. “Wanna play?”



I scrambled backwards, out of the crawlspace, before slumping back in a daze. My limbs felt like lead, my vision blurry. I heard the children let out disappointed cries as the man’s face peaked out of the crawlspace, half hidden in shadow. 



*“Don’t worry,”* he whispered, his voice dripping with menace. *“You’ll love it here. We all do. Don’t we, kids?”*



High-pitched cheers echoed out. 



That’s the last thing I remember. The sound of happy children and the man’s toothy grin rearing up from underneath. 


________________________________________




And do you know what? He wasn’t wrong. 


A difficult transition, as all things are. Didn’t sleep the first week, and now I sleep all day. Probably sugar crashing tbh. 



Now, I love it here. I’ve grown fond of the kids and their games. I’ve come to learn that the “wife” is called Margaret, and she isn’t officially his wife. Sometimes, her eyes follow me, and she’ll mumble something incoherent. Like she has something to tell me, but it comes out twisted. Generally she’s quiet, but I enjoy her company.



Mrs. Reed doesn’t complain anymore. In fact, I haven’t seen her in days. 



I’m sure she’ll understand eventually. Just like I did.



Anyway, the apartment’s finally prepped for a new tenant. $550pm, a really **great bargain** in this area! Especially with such... quiet neighbors. Enquire Below!

1g2orrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1g2orrl/a_review_of_iceland_with_kids/,A Review of Iceland With Kids,"We just got back from a trip with our five year-old and I wanted to post a review for anyone who may be thinking of doing the same. This subreddit was incredibly helpful in planning our trip, but I struggled a little bit planning for kids, so I hope this helps.

  
TL;DR - Iceland is unlike anywhere else in the world. The nature and people are incredible. Yes, it is jaw-droppingly expensive, but if you have the means to go you will not regret it.

**General Tips:**

1. Don't over-plan. Iceland is a huge place and you can't see and do it all in just a few days. Even the golden circle is a full day for little people. Trying to do too much is just going to result in over-tired, cranky kids and adults.

2. Leave time for spontaneous moments. These were the favorite parts of the trip for me. If you see something that interests you or your kid(s) go off your planned route and check it out. 

3. Iceland takes the European approach to safety, meaning that YOU are responsible for you and your kid(s) safety. You won't find huge signs and high fences warning you not to do things. You might find a small rope marking off a path, but not much more. The paths are safe, but stepping off them could mean stepping into a pool of boiling geothermal water or a fall off a high cliff. We saw countless adults struggling with this and making very foolish decisions. If you keep your kid(s) close and talk about the risks beforehand you will be absolutely fine.

  
On to the review. We had three and a half-days in Iceland. What follows is a list of what we did and my thoughts for kids and adults. 

**Logistics:**

Icelandair is absolutely great, especially for kids. On each leg of our flight they included a meal for kids, an activity book with crayons and headphones for  

Reykjavik Residence Apartment Hotel - A really great place to stay. The rooms are very clean and the shower pressure is top-notch.  Our room included a separate bed for our son, a  small kitchen with everything you need.

Car Rental - If you can, rent from a company that is located INSIDE the airport. This may be the only place I think we may have made a mistake. We rented from a company that was off-site. Although they offered a shuttle, we had to wait at the airport for more than a half-hour to get picked up and drop-off was even longer than that.

**Day 1** - We arrived in the late afternoon so this was really only a partial day for us. We spent the evening getting settled in, grabbing a bit to eat (The Posthus food hall has something for everybody) and exploring a bit of Reykjavik. 

**Day 2 - Golden Circle**

Thingvellir National Park - Kids rating 2/5, Adults rating 4/5

This is where two tectonic plates meet. The scenery is beautiful and we walked out to Oxarfoss waterfall and back. It's not a long walk for adults, but it was for our little guy, and there wasn't too much to keep his attention. In my opinion there are so many more fascinating things to see on the Golden Circle that you may want to skip this stop if you don't want to over-pack your day.

Fontana Geothermal Bakery - Kids rating 3/5, Adults rating 4/5

We stopped here for a snack and a break. We chose not to pay for the tour and I think that was the right call. In the 30 minutes we were there we saw two tours start and come in to try the bread.  You can walk down to the beach and see where the bread is buried and some boiling hot-springs. They have a small cafe where you can buy the bread on its own, or a sandwich with butter, smoked trout and boiled egg. The sandwich is really, really good. The bread on its own is very sweet.

Bruarfoss Waterfall - Kids 4/5, Adults 5/5

A very short hike and a really cool waterfall. You likely won't stay for very long, but it's worth the stop.

Efstidalur Dairy Farm - Kids 5/5, Adults 5/5

You MUST stop here if you have kids. We probably spent an hour and a half here. They have a really good restaurant upstairs and some of the best ice cream we've ever had downstairs. The restaurant is connected to the barn and they have glass windows between the two so that you can see the cows in their stalls. They also have horses, two very friendly dogs, a playground and best of all, one of those huge bouncy mats.

Geysir - Kids 5/5, Adults 5/5

Another must stop. We spent a really long time here watching they geyser erupt. They have a great gift shop too if you're going be buying any souvenirs. 

Gulfoss Waterfall - Kid 5/5, Adults 5/5

Another one I would highly recommend. Much larger and very different from Bruarfoss.

Bru Horse Farm - Kids 5/5, Adults 5/5

This was amongst the highlights of our trip. By this time our son was really wearing down and the trip was becoming not so fun for everyone. This wasn't on the itinerary, but it is literally right off the main road and we decided to stop here to try to make things better. It was FANTASTIC. You get really up close to some Icelandic horses and see just how different they are. For a few dollars you can buy food to feed the horses which brought all of the smiles back. The owner came down while we were here and I got to have a long, friendly chat with him. He also took our son and let him sit and then stand on a horse. Very cool!

Kerid Volcanic Crater - Kid slept through it, Adults 5/5

I know my son would have loved this. It is absolutely incredible to see. If we were here a little earlier in the day we could have walked all the way around the top or walked down to the lake at the bottom. We stopped just for a quick look, but I really wish we could have stayed longer.

This marked the end of the day for us. The drive back to the hotel was about an hour. You get to see some really amazing scenery along the way.

**Day 3 - Reykjavik Day**

We did a lot of walking on this day. The buildings around Reyk are so interesting this was an adventure all on its own.

Lava Show - Kids 5/5, Adults 5/5

This is something my son really wanted to do, but that I didn't really think I would enjoy. It was actually a lot of fun and educational. Its short, only about 50 minutes, but I think it was well worth it. We made an adventure of walking down there, seeing the show, going to the OmNom chocolate shop and then the food hall across the street. 

Elding Whale Watching - Kids 5/5, Adults 5/5

What an incredible adventure! This was worth every penny for us. The tour is three hours (which is a long time for kids). They have adult and kid sized snow suits to keep warm. The ship has many levels to explore. We spent a long time following two hump back whales that were really putting on a show and towards the end a third hump back joined them

 The seas can be very choppy. If they offer you a seasickness pill, I suggest you take it. We did and felt great. Some others on the tour didn't and spent the three hours curled up in a ball on the floor.

After this we walked back to the hotel, did some shopping and had dinner. The skies were clear and I downloaded the Aurora App, so we knew in advance we had a really good chance of seeing the Northern lights. 

Northern Lights at Grotta Lighthouse - Kids 3/5, Adults 5/5

I didn't know that the lights can be pretty hard to see with the naked eye. As a result, there wasn't that much to see for our son. If you do some research in advance you can learn which camera settings to use on your phone to get some really amazing pictures. The quickest way is to just make sure that you have live photos on. They won't be the best pictures, but it will work.

**Day 4 - Reykjavik and Blue Lagoon**

This was just about a last walk around and some last minute shopping before heading to the Blue Lagoon. 

Hallgrimskirkja Cathedral - Kids 5/5, Adults 5/5

This was definitely worth the stop. The architecture inside and out is just so fascinating. My don wanted to take the elevator to the top, which we did. We got some really great views of the city. 

Bouncy Mat - Kids 5/5, Adults 5/5

My don wasn't done with these yet and we had to find another one. These are just plain fun. You can use this website to find one close to you: [https://aerslabelgir.is/kort-af-aerslabelgjum/](https://aerslabelgir.is/kort-af-aerslabelgjum/)

Blue Lagoon - Kids 5/5, Adults 5/5

The Blue Lagoon is just so famous that you have to stop if you can. It's pricey, but worth it. We spent about two hours here. If you go when it's cold you can walk into a shallow indoor pool, open a door and walk out to the lagoon. We paid to rent bath robes, but you really don't need to.

Lava fields - Kids 5/5, Adults 5/5

Earlier this year a volcanic eruption went right over the main road to the Blue Lagoon. They've built a new road and right at the intersection there is a small parking area where cars were stopped. This was jaw-dropping and worth the stop. Should you take a few lava rocks home? Probably not. Will you? That's up to you,

After this we went to the airport for our flight home. It was another action packed day for our son and he had a good long sleep on the flight home.

**A final note on food:** 

Just a few quick notes on restaurants - Overall the food is very expensive, but we found the quality was better than what you get in North America. 

Braud and Co is great, we had breakfast here every day. The cinnamon buns are renowned, but my controversial take is they were not the best thing there. They have lots of other flavors of buns every day including vanilla, pecan and caramel, raspberry, etc. The coffee is terrible.

Te & Kaffi - It's on the main street and very much like a Starbucks. We got pretty decent coffee here.

Hotdogs - The dog itself is great. They do put a lot of sauces on them, which I think took away from it a little bit.

Rosso Pomodor - An Italian place on the main street. Very good food and kid friendly.

Posthus Food Hall - Very good, but pricey. 

Bonus - One of the local grocery stores. Much, much cheaper than eating in restaurants, and seeing the different things they have it an adventure in itself.

  
**The End!** This turned out to be a very long post, but I hope it helps someone planning their trip. This was an unforgettable experience and I would recommend it to anyone.

If you have any questions don't be afraid to ask!

1g2ooxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1g2ooxn/manger_being_unreasonably_harsh_on_me/,Manger being unreasonably harsh on me,"I work in a fairly fancy hospitality service as a waiter, and a few months ago - about the same time as when I joined - we got a new manager. They don’t have experience in management, and only has tangential experience with hospitality.  
Things were ok at first, but it’s become obvious They is quite incompetent. They cannot fulfil the roll the rest of the waiters perform, leading to her actively avoiding duties that They should excel at. For example, they never take tables, they never take food from the kitchen, all they do is patrol the floor and pour drinks, point out 'problems' or seat/talk to guests.  
More recently though, they have only given me late starting shifts and being extra particular with how I work. They frequently point out frivolous details and asks me to clean things during a very busy service when I am trying to provide guests their food. A few weeks ago, they told me about how I should check a tables water level and top them off whenever I deliver food. Fair enough, I missed a table during the busy period, that's on me. They catch this and confronts me in the kitchen while I am holding the docket to collect the food for my table. Later during service, it happens again, but I am too busy working in my own section to fill up the water in this other waiter's section. At this point I finally speak up and start saying how unfair it is that They always criticizes me, and only me and did not criticize the sections waiter (who was also just at the table) for filling up their water.  
They takes me aside and we have a brief chat about things. I mention how I feel it is unfair how They nitpicks me etc, and They says They is trying to teach me to build me up. They also say my generation is sensitive and didn't mean to personally offend me. They then insinuate that if I don't improve over time then eventually I could no longer be working there.  
Just very recently we had a very busy day. I was working feverishly to get my tables their food promptly, and as a part of this certain tasks like cleaning and clearing tables need to be prioritized lower than carrying and setting.  
They catches me just after delivering coffee to my table, when I return to grab cutlery for my next table who has been waiting a reasonable time to have their next course. They say, ""can I have service on that table"" (referring to clearing their previous courses plates) and I respond ""in just a moment, I need to do this first"" or something along those lines, as I want to set them and call their food so it can start cooking now before I begin cleaning other tables. They then pull me aside, even further away from the busy service and says ""this is your final warning, you need to control your temper otherwise I will have to send you home early. It is unacceptable that service is slipping like that, and if you're too busy you need to get me or get help."" (actually, my first warning about anything, and my temper was completely regular) They finally lets me return to the busy service. Issue is during a service like that there is nowhere near enough time to find my manager who is usually yakking away at a table rather than helping, and my fellow co-workers are also working at full capacity. I believe I was making a reasonable decision with my priorities.  
Later They tells me They spilt water on my table, I tell her alright, get a cloth to clean it, but end up being called into the kitchen to carry (hot) food away. They then walk into the kitchen and asks if I cleaned it. I then state, ""I've just got to take this first, but I just put a cloth out there"", They then says ""No. No no no, I can't do that"" and leaves the kitchen. Is They too good to kneel and clean their mess on the floor or something?  
Later that same day, I am leaving the kitchen when I see them look at a table’s food, look at the docket, and then whisper to themself I'll come back later and walk out of the kitchen. I beg your pardon what? Why? Take it, it is RIGHT there. Then come 3PM They sends me home early because we are overstaffed. Fair enough, but this is the fourth time in a row I have been sent home first, combined with getting the late start shifts I have to take the long drive to work, just to be used for the busy service period, to get sent home and skip the chill cleaning period and have my wages almost cut in half.  
Anyway, I apologize if this is poorly constructed or ranty, I kind of needed to get it off my chest. I also obfuscated their gender after writing it which has definitely broken some grammar. My question is what do I do from here - do I;  
-Confront my manager, complain about being sent home early, starting late, being picked on, having shit like my temper just made up  
-Look for a different job  
-Escalate to other managers in my company  
-Or some other thing I can’t think of.

I would also like to say, I believe I am a pretty good employee. I try very hard and will honestly admit when I make mistakes, its just... the mistakes They points out are always the non-mistakes.  
Thank you guys!

1g2om5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1g2om5i/well_that_happened/,Well that happened…,"I got married. 

My wedding was beautiful. I now have a new last name that I cherish. It’s so nice to be wanted and loved and embraced and brought into a new family. Even if it is basically just me and my partner. We’re us now. 

But that’s not what I’m writing about. 

My dad decided my wedding day was the place to say how bad I looked this last year.

I’ve lost a good amount of weight (for myself not the wedding) in the last year, the most noticeable difference happening in the months I didn’t see my dad until the wedding day. 

“You look- you look great. You really do, you know- last year you looked bad, just- just bad. You know, you weren’t looking your best, I know, but you’ve-“ on and on even as I said “I don’t want to talk about this” about four times before he then decided to remind me of how bullied I was as a child and he never thought I’d be happy, that the first dance was a lovely song but we could have done with some dancing lessons, and that anyone could have written my vows since everyone can see how much me and my husband love each other. 

It was upsetting. 

And it followed me for a couple of days until I cried about it to my husband and he said I’ve never looked bad a day in my life (❤️). We went on our honeymoon. We came home. I went to work for a few days, told my therapist about it and then my dad asked me if I was in for coffee. 

I’d already decided the day before with my therapist that I had to say something. I wasn’t going to keep protecting my dad from the consequences of his actions. I wasn’t going to keep feeling frustrated and twisted in myself because I was bottling it up. 

My heart was racing as we chatted about nothing. And he was nearly due to leave and I said it. 

“Do you remember much of the wedding party? You’d had a few (to drink)”

“Yeah, yeah I remember it all.”

“Do you remember telling me how bad I’ve looked?”

Deer in headlights. He had no excuse. He then said it was the drink. Then jealousy (he’s very very thin). Then that he hurts people before they hurt him (“then you’re becoming what you’re afraid of” I said). He apologised, said he’d never say anything to hurt me, that he loves me. I said that it came from the opposite place of love, that he’s not just hurt me but that I can’t think about my wedding day for long without thinking about that moment. 

We talked for a while. I’m so proud of myself. I didn’t cry. I didn’t let his apologies go with an “it’s okay” as I would have. I didn’t let his near-tears move me. 

I told him he needs therapy. 

He’s booked in but honestly that’s not my business. I did it to fix me not him. 

He did put his foot in his mouth again, he said one good thing to come of this is him getting therapy. He then said there I go again, I shouldn’t say that. I said no, you shouldn’t, this is never going to disappear for me. 

I was my own hero. I saved myself. It felt amazing. I was the parent to my inner child and I was the protector I needed. ",4,1728822754.0,emotionalneglect,0,1.0,False

Favorite song tattooed on her leg

I wonder if she noticed me

Walking past her on the street

Short of breath, composure lacking

Mind is racing, too much coffee

Let the words fall from my mouth

Side by side and way too loud



Excuse me while I overthink it now

I pray to no one I don’t let me down



Imitate her favorite bands

But I can’t sing the way they can

I’m feeling useless

And she’s so perfect

Play the songs I think she’ll like

Well rehearsed when I go to strike

But I’m nervous

And she’s so perfect



And I’m scared of what’s to come

I don’t know if I’ve been doing it right or wrong

I’m trying to figure her out

But she scares me

And I know that I will fuck this up

Before I find out if it’s truly love

So I don’t know why I’ve been putting myself through all of this

Preview:

Aziraphale stared at the empty room, completely unsure of what had just happened. He had clearly done something wrong but he had no idea what it was. With a heavy heart, he turned out all the lights in the shop, locked up and went home.

He ate his dinner alone at the tiny kitchen table in his apartment. He hadn’t even bothered to turn on the lights in the living room; he ate in the overbright fluorescent light of his kitchen which somehow made the experience even more unpleasant. He only managed a few bites before pushing the food away. He couldn’t name the feeling that had curled up heavy in his belly, he only knew it was awful. The whole business with Crowley that evening had been so strange. Nothing was done or said that was upsetting and yet it seemed both of them had left the encounter in bad temper. He hoped the ill feeling wouldn’t bleed over into Saturday night. Aziraphale was actually looking forward to the symphony.

Three o’clock in the morning came and went with Aziraphale staring at the ceiling in his bedroom, replaying the evening with Crowley again in his mind. He tried to take stock of the situation. Even though dating was a young man’s game and he’d given it up many years prior, out of the blue, he’d developed a crush on a man he’d known for only five days. There was absolutely no indication that the attraction was reciprocated.

Recently I got prescribed a valerian-based pill (in addition to Sertraline, which I've been taking for a while). I'm a very anxious person and my family setting is a mess. My mother has Borderline Personality Disorder and that often gets in the way of us getting along, as we have very different reactions and opinions on mundane things.

That's just to say that, whenever I noticed this was happening, I immediately thought to myself ""Maybe I'm just stressed, maybe I can somehow hear her moving around the house"". But here's another piece of context.

My bedroom is the only room on the second floor. It's a strange house. You have to walk across the backyard (which isn't that large, really) and up the stairs to find my door and a tiny balcony. So my bedroom is practically out in the open and higher than the rest of the house, but it's all the same building. I can barely hear anything from downstairs when I'm in my room, and vice versa. If neither I or my mother feel like going up/down the stairs to communicate, we'll just call each other's phones instead. That's how isolated we are from each other, sound wise.

It's been a week since I've started taking the valerian-based medicine, which is around the time I noticed this was happening. I'm on a gap year and have no real need to wake up early (save for medical appointments, vet visits, you get it). Sometimes I'll sleep the day off, sometimes I'll be awake by 6am, it really depends.

Despite the lack of routine, if I wake up, say, at 8 in the morning, my mother is surely going to call me at around 8:20. If I wake up at 3pm, even if I try to go back to sleep, I'll startle myself awake with the ringtone roughly half an hour later. I'm not a light sleeper by any means and, as mentioned previously, I can't hear anything from downstairs. If she moves around, uses the restroom, whips up some coffee, I can't hear it because of how distant my bedroom is.

Thanks to her medication, my mother also has a very irregular sleep routine, sometimes sleeping the entire day. So, no, I have no means of predicting at which time she'll wake up and call me. Even when she does wake up early, she'll certainly spend HOURS browsing social media before actually getting out of bed.

So how come I always startle myself awake every single day, like clockwork, 5~40 minutes before my mother calls me, if neither of us have a steady routine? I've considered that this might be a trauma response, but the irregular routine just makes it unlikely that my brain will just guess ""oh, she might wake us up in X minutes"".

1g2oa53,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g2oa53/apartment_for_rent_enquire_within/,Apartment for rent. Enquire within!,"I always liked having my own space. I’d had my fair share of experience with cramped dorms and messy, inconsiderate roommates. It wasn’t for me. So when I found a small, ground-floor apartment near campus, I didn’t hesitate. It wasn’t fancy, but it had everything I needed. Quiet, private, and fairly cheap—perfect for my last year of university.



Everything was good—until the neighbors started complaining.



It began with Mrs. Reed from next door, catching me in the hallway one morning. She looked tired, her eyes heavy with bags.



“Elizabeth, are you having late-night parties?” she asked, her voice sharper than usual.



I blinked, confused. “*No?* I go to bed at 10.”



She shook her head, a deep frown settling into her jowls. “I hear music. Laughing, banging on the walls. You should be more considerate.”



I hadn’t heard a thing. “I’m sorry, but it’s not me. I promise.”



She squinted at me like she didn’t believe a word I said. *“Just keep it down.”*



Nights were quiet on my end. I didn’t throw parties or invite friends over, I’m a bit of a recluse, honestly. I barely left the apartment, aside from classes or library runs. Still, the complaints didn’t stop. More neighbors started approaching me in the hallways, their faces drawn and annoyed, asking about the noise. To keep it down. 



The thing is though, every night I slept like a rock. **Nothing** woke me up. **Nothing** ever stirred. I tried staying up one night to catch the sound, but I was too exhausted. I wasn’t going to sacrifice my sleep for something I *knew* I wasn’t contributing to, so I passed out around 11p.m. with no disturbances. 



One evening, after a long day of studying at the library, I came home to find a note slipped under the door. It was crumpled and hastily written: “Noise complaints. Handle it.” Next to it, bizarrely enough, was a chocolate bar wrapper. A small amount of slick, melted chocolate still inside. The letter itself smeared in it. 



I was pissed tbh. *What the hell?* It wasn’t even me making the noise, and *why?* Why stuff your own trash along with the letter?  Frustrated and tired, I tossed the note on the counter and the wrapper in the trash. Then, I collapsed into bed and fell into a study-induced coma.



That was the night things started going missing.



At first, it was small stuff—pens, keys, a sock here or there. The usual, nothing suspicious. They always turned up, but never where I left them. I figured it was stress; finals were around the corner, and I was so drowsy all the time. I chalked it up to forgetfulness.



Then one morning, I found my toothbrush sitting on the coffee table. It was damp, *tinged brown.* The odd thing? I hadn’t brushed my teeth yet. I knew I hadn’t. I still had morning breath. 



I started to wonder if I was sleepwalking. Could I have been getting up in the middle of the night, moving things without realizing it? Making loud noises? I considered having a friend stay over to keep an eye on me, but that felt… extreme? 



I finally got my answer a week later, at a point where I was being threatened with eviction due to these unexplained noise complaints. I noticed a panel in the base of my closet was... ajar? I froze. The base always looked solid before, nothing loose. Curiosity got the better of me, sliding it open some more and being met with a stale, cool breeze rising up from below. Stupid I know, but I peaked my head in, discovering a crawlspace. 



It couldn’t be more than three feet high, dank and covered in thick dusty cobwebs. Scattered throughout the space were chocolate bar wrappers. It smelt like mould and *sickly sweetness.*



I guess I was naive. I assumed I’d find some wily raccoons, a stray cat. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and peered further in. There were several cushions steeped in mould, discarded soda cans, more chocolate bar wrappers. It smelt of sugar and rank air. No scratching, no animal sounds.



But deeper into the darkness, *I saw them.* Four pairs of eyes, squinting from the light I brought in with me. As my eyes settled. I realised what was staring back at me. 



Two children sat cross-legged on the floor. They were pale, gaunt, with dark circles under their eyes. But their knees rocked with giddy excitement, their smiles smeared with chocolate. The boy let out a small giggle as his eyes met mine. 



Slumped against the left side was a woman. Her face was blank, her eyes unfocused. Staring at everything; and nothing, in particular. 



And in the far corner, drenched in darkness, was a man. Hunched on all fours, watching me intently with a calm expression. 



*“You’re finally here,”* his voice was soft, with a hint of malice. 



He gestured toward the children, who were still giggling.  *“The kids love playing at night. Apologies, they can get a little loud.”*



He smirked. A small, controlled smile. From his pocket he revealed a tiny glass bottle. *“I’ve been helping you though. You’re a sound sleeper when you’re… properly dosed.”*



My blood ran cold as the cramped, rank space I peaked my head into began to spin. “...You’ve been drugging me?” 



He shrugged, nonchalant, then gestured toward the woman slumped in the corner. “My wife doesn’t talk much these days, but she enjoys the company.”



The woman didn’t react to being addressed. 



Something cold brushed against my hand. The little girl was crouched next to me, her fingers icy as she tugged at my fingers. Her eyes were wide as she stared up at me, her smile never fading. “Wanna play?”



I scrambled backwards, out of the crawlspace, before slumping back in a daze. My limbs felt like lead, my vision blurry. I heard the children let out disappointed cries as the man’s face peaked out of the crawlspace, half hidden in shadow. 



*“Don’t worry,”* he whispered, his voice dripping with menace. *“You’ll love it here. We all do. Don’t we, kids?”*



High-pitched cheers echoed out. 



That’s the last thing I remember. The sound of happy children and the man’s toothy grin rearing up from underneath. 


________________________________________




And do you know what? He wasn’t wrong. 


A difficult transition, as all things are. Didn’t sleep the first week, and now I sleep all day. Probably sugar crashing tbh. 



Now, I love it here. I’ve grown fond of the kids and their games. I’ve come to learn that the “wife” is called Margaret, and she isn’t officially his wife. Sometimes, her eyes follow me, and she’ll mumble something incoherent. Like she has something to tell me, but it comes out twisted. Generally she’s quiet, but I enjoy her company.



Mrs. Reed doesn’t complain anymore. In fact, I haven’t seen her in days. 



I’m sure she’ll understand eventually. Just like I did.



Anyway, the apartment’s finally prepped for a new tenant. $550pm, a really **great bargain** in this area! Especially with such... quiet neighbors. Enquire Below!

1g2o9jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g2o9jk/aitah_for_refusing_to_help_my_sister_financially/,AITAH for refusing to help my sister financially after she cut me off for years?,"I (32F) grew up with a close-knit family, especially with my older sister Anna (36F). We were inseparable throughout our childhood and teenage years. Anna was always my protector, my confidante, and my best friend. When our parents divorced when I was 15, it was Anna who helped me through it. She was my rock, and I thought nothing could ever come between us. We shared everything, and I looked up to her in so many ways.

However, things started to change when Anna met Mike (37M). Mike seemed nice at first, but over time, I noticed a shift. He was always a bit controlling, and he didn’t seem to like me very much. At family gatherings, he’d make passive-aggressive comments about my lifestyle or career choices. When I was in college, studying art and design, he’d always mock my “useless degree,” saying I’d never make a living off it. Anna would laugh along or say nothing, and I figured she just didn’t want to get involved.

After they got married about 10 years ago, it became clear that Mike wanted to separate Anna from her family. He didn’t outright say it, but little things piled up. Suddenly, they were too busy to meet up, and Anna stopped answering my texts and calls as frequently. At first, I thought maybe they were just adjusting to married life. But over the years, it became more and more evident that Anna was drifting away. I’d invite her to coffee, to family dinners, to anything, and she’d always have an excuse—“I’m busy,” “Mike and I are working through some things,” “Maybe next time.”

About five years ago, Anna just stopped communicating altogether. No explanation. No fight. Just silence. I was devastated. I tried reaching out several times, leaving voicemails and sending messages, but nothing. It was like she vanished from my life. I eventually stopped trying because it was too painful. I’d hear updates about her through our mom, but even my parents had minimal contact with her.

During this time, I worked hard to build my career. Despite Mike’s dismissive attitude toward my degree, I actually did really well in the design field. I started my own business, which grew quickly, and I’m now financially stable. I’m not rich, but I’m comfortable, and I’ve been proud of the life I’ve built for myself.

Then, about two months ago, out of the blue, Anna called me. I was shocked but happy to hear from her. For a brief moment, I thought maybe she wanted to reconnect, to apologize, or at least explain why she cut me off for all those years. But the conversation quickly turned into something else. Anna and Mike were having serious financial problems. Mike had lost his job, and they were struggling to pay their mortgage and bills. She said they’d tried getting help from other family members, but no one could afford to help them out.

Anna asked me for a loan, not a small one either—she was talking thousands of dollars. She said they were desperate, and if they didn’t get help soon, they could lose their house. I told her I needed time to think about it and hung up.

Honestly, I felt conflicted. On one hand, she’s my sister, and I know she’s in a tough spot. On the other hand, I can’t ignore the fact that she abandoned me when I needed her the most. For years, she acted like I didn’t exist, and now the only reason she’s talking to me is because she needs money? I couldn't help but feel used. It hurt that there was no apology or acknowledgment of what she’d done. It was all about her problems and what I could do for her.

I talked to some friends about it, and opinions were mixed. Some said, ""She’s family, you should help her, even if she was distant before."" Others told me that I shouldn’t feel obligated to bail her out, especially considering how she treated me for all those years. One of my close friends pointed out that helping her financially might not even fix the problem if Mike is still in control of their decisions.

After thinking it over for a few days, I called Anna back and told her that I wasn’t comfortable lending her the money, especially since we hadn’t been in contact for so long. I told her that I was hurt by the way she cut me out of her life, and it didn’t feel right for me to just jump in now and help when she hadn’t shown any interest in maintaining our relationship.

Anna didn’t take it well. She said I was being petty and vindictive. She accused me of punishing her for something that happened years ago and said I was letting her family suffer just to “prove a point.” She even said that I was lucky to be in a good financial position and that I didn’t understand what it was like to struggle. That hurt the most, because I’ve had my fair share of struggles, too, but I’ve worked hard to get where I am.

Now, my parents are involved. They think I should help Anna, even if it’s just a loan. They say she’s still my sister and that family should come first. But I can’t shake the feeling that if I give her the money, I’m just enabling the same behavior that led her to cut me off in the first place. I don’t know if I’ll ever see that money again, and part of me feels like she’ll go back to ignoring me once they’re financially stable again.",87,1728821543.0,AITAH,72,0.99,False

My starting weight was 117kg, and have been loosing an average 0.5kg loss per week. 

Former couch potato, I never thought I’d say I am enjoying going to the gym, and I have to say a lot of it is down to my PT. I am currently going to the gym twice per week for PT led sessions (learning how to exercise correctly with weights/machines), and trying to consistently hit 8-10k steps (which can be challenging when I work a desk job 50/60h per week, and mainly from home) so over the last week I started adding treadmill walks in the morning/evening to get that step count higher.

Diet-wise, whilst I am not on a specific/restrictive diet, I am more mindful of what I eat - no more snacking in front of the screen/tv or going through a bar of chocolate in one sitting. 

Majority of my meals are home cooked - I cook and bake a lot, with maybe a takeaway once per week. I was hoping there is an app or calculator that could estimate calories and maybe macros for home cooked meals, so I can keep an accurate log (more than coffee for breakfast, omelet for lunch, and roast beef for supper). 

I am happy with the progress, and whilst I know that steady pace wins the race and accept that I can’t undo years of indulgence and no exercise in a short timeframe, I am wondering if there is something I am missing/I could do better to ensure success and a sustainable change?

Any app recommendations or thoughts on how I can improve would be greatly appreciated!",2,1728821396.0,loseit,7,1.0,False
