1hxlwr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1hxlwr5/hey_bisalp_besties_i_joined_the_club_officially/,Hey Bisalp Besties! I joined the club officially today💜here’s my super detailed journey so far,"Surgery rundown timeline roughly: 

Bisalp consult- 11/11/24 
Pre-op assessment- 12/30/24
Bisalp- 1/9/25
Post op will be- 1/20/25

•7:30AM  Surgery day / today, 1/9/25• (24f)

-The night before the surgery, 1/8/25,  I stopped eating and drinking all liquids and water at 9:30PM and at 10:00PM did a shower/ rinse with antiseptic hibiclens (even though this wasn’t in my instructions I saw so many others mention it & thought it wouldn’t hurt me to do it too) 

——
Day of surgery breakdown to the best of my ability: 

3:50 AM final hibiclens body rinse/ shower (for both times so important that you do it everywhere except face, ears, hair , and genitals)

4:45 AM on the road headed to surgery 

5:30AM finally arrived and it was 2 hours early w/ family member driving me, parked, and located where I needed to be and checked in. I think I checked in at 5:40AM (the hospital was so easy to get lost in, it was huge and like a maze, we got lost in it) 

By 6:10 AM I was signing paperwork then moved on to a separate waiting room area for surgeries

6:20 AM I was taken back for surgery prep 

6:30 AM met my actual team & helpers for the day and they all were so kind and lovely 

7:30 AM surgery began 

9:10 AM I woke up in a recovery room and was given snacks & ginger ale & water. I drank so much water tbh I felt dehydrated after cutting myself off at 9:30 for good measure 
(The surgery itself took 20-35 minutes, and then the rest of that slight gap was me being asleep) 

10:00AM I peed! Drinking a lot of the liquids after waking up from surgery I believe was so helpful! I know many people struggle to per afterwards, super valid. 
(I have to pee a lot after everything hahah) 

10:40 AM Was talked thru discharge / recovery care instructions for when I’m home 

11:00 AM I was in the car with my family member on my way back home 

11:30 AM I went to get oatmeal and orange juice at a coffee shop

12:00/ NOON finally home and have been resting since :) 

——
Side-notes in no particular order:

-At my pre-op appointment I was told it’s okay if I skip my levothyroxine dose the day of surgery (usually 75mg) so I went ahead and skipped it, all good. Also I believe midnight was  technically the absolute cut off for food and maybe a few hours stopping water before surgery, I just cut myself off at 9:30 PM the night before because meh, it worked for me. 

-I was never called before by the hospital before my surgery date (they said they would but oops they didn’t) to talk more about prep before the surgery but this community was so helpful. I got the hibiclens antiseptic soap from target and did a shower the night before and the morning of as well (again full body except for hair,ears,  genitals, and face) I didn’t have any vitamins for a little bit longer than a week, maybe 9 days before surgery I stopped (I usually take vitamin D3+K2, heme iron, and vitamin B12) 

-I got my period yesterday, and if anyone’s curious (I was tbh just because I overthink sometimes) wondering if period would have any effect on my pregnancy pee sample today or my overall surgery, and of course it was no big deal at all. I was given these mesh underwear and a pad, tbh very comfy and I like them a lot.

-Before the 7 day period of stopping all vitamins and herbs I took Zicam cold remedy for a solid 3 days, I swear by it. Also, tis the season and I could not chance being sick for the procedure and needing to cancel. Take it or leave it, I feel this helped my body prepare for the procedure and stay healthy. I also drank a lot of orange juice and spearmint teas.

-I actually was so excited for my surgery and stressed I would miss my appointment so I pulled an all nighter…. and I typically would say never do an all-nighter but for my racing mind and excitement it was a really great decision for me. I figure I’ll be doing a lot of extra resting while I recover from this anyways so it works out, and everything went incredibly well :) 

-Make sure you trust and like your surgeon / OBGYN I can’t emphasize enough how important that one is, don’t force yourself to go with whoever will agree to do the surgery for you first, trust your gut.

-Gas is real, but luckily zero upper shoulder pressure or pain as I’ve read on this community is quite common afterwards. The gas I’m referring to is quite literally passing gas, so I keep moving around slowly to help with it, but it’s not painful whatsoever and I’m not even bloated (tbh I’m used to bloating since I have gut issues here and there, so perhaps I unknowingly have trained for this hahaha, it really feels so subtle & minimal) 

-My surgeon signed my belly hehehe (yes they always do to mark spots and make certain notes) I thought it was cool, I was like woah I get your autograph!!? Awesome stuff. 


- Definitely arrive earlier than you think you need to, I seriously thought I’d be sitting around for hours until 7:30 surgery time (since they never called to inform me, but my bad since I could’ve double checked but followed my gut) but anyways it worked out so perfectly. It’s better to be safe than sorry you know! 

-Make sure you ahead of time plan where you will be parking, and make sure you know the hospital / campus/ facility you are going to! It was totally confusing for me in this huge hospital  I’d never been in before, and the layout was so odd too so it added to my confusion. Also, accidentally parked in a parking ramp that is much more popular for staff members, so the signage was a huge struggle, oops, but it all worked out. 


-This might sound so obvious, but if you have stairs to go up grip the railing or wall and really truly go one stair at a time and only go up slow almost penguin-like tbh, that’s working very well for me. Also, I’ve been walking like an old lady slowly and delicately, it’s all good. 

-For getting around use your arms a ton to push you up and your glutes to power you moving up and down along with other muscles. (I myself after this surgery really realize how much ,without being consciously aware of, the core is involved with all movements so I’m mentally actively telling myself not to use it)

- when sitting down, sit first very slowly vertically, then move one leg at a time horizontally to the side to where you need it for laying down. Pretend you’re a precious baby who must be extra careful of your slightest movements (again all this may be obvious I just want to be super clear about what is very helpful after being fresh out of surgery) 
- Be gentle with yourself! Mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually, this day is about you so don’t let anything get to you, you’re strong.
- I have a ton of energy after the surgery surprisingly? I feel a wave of excitement and peace, and I don’t know if everyone feel that way afterwards but it’s great. I feel a whole new energy has been unlocked. 
- I am not nauseous after anesthesia whatsoever! They told me there was a really high chance to expect thag but as of now I feel lucky because it hasn’t hit and I hope it doesn’t.
- I don’t know if my pain tolerance is high? But post surgery and waking up, knock on wood, fingers crossed, my pain is 1/10 I’d even that. It is so bearable and it’s not pain, more like an awareness in my body and sensations. I feel a pressure especially in my belly button but again I wouldn’t describe it as pain. I may try to get ahead of the pain by taking some pain killers anyways but not too bad really. It feels like I overdid it on Pilates ab core exercises
- I don’t have a sore throat (which is often reported in this surgery luckily) it just feels like drainage in the back of my throat that I can’t cough up because it’ll brace my core which I do not want to do. Sometimes maybe a minor tickle feeling too but drinking water helps it quickly. 
- Also heads up, the nurse made me laugh once on accident and it didn’t hurt but boy it was very uncomfortable pressure wise there… (who knew) so I really don’t want to laugh for a while. Humor will have to wait on the sidelines until you are healed or you might hurt your incision. Today I learned that laughing heavily ties to the core muscles, I get why people say stopppp you’re gonna give me abs because oh boy, brace yourself fr after this. 

- In my opinion, the worst part is them putting the IV in your hand. It felt like a cat bit my hand lightly if I’m honest even then though (they couldn’t find a good vein in their first IV placement try, but they did my other hand and it worked that time luckily) 

-OUTFIT WISE WEAR A LONG SLIP DRESS OMG. THE DRESS DOESNT RUB ON MY INCISIONS AT ALL AND FEELS LIKE A SOFT HUG. I wore a really tall/ long, oversized, comfy, black slip dress, and it is soft af almost pajamas. I paired my dress with a front zip sports bra, and with a button up cardigan, so easy to deal with. The shoes I wore were slide on shoes which helped me tremendously as well. 

-The whole day time  felt as if it was nonexistent, like I would blink and then wake up and more time than I realized passed. It all felt very peaceful though and I loved having such kind-hearted people helping me. 

- Hopefully I haven’t spoken too soon…. But yeah everything has been excellent! I haven’t even taken any pain medicine yet and don’t think I will ever need to, though I was prescribed heavy pain medicine. I thought I’d be asleep by now especially since I pulled an all nighter due to how early everything was, but I got home before lunchtime so yay!!!!!! Time to rest, snack, and watch my favorite animes yayyyyy

-Want to add that WOW bringing a pillow for the seatbelt during the car ride home…. Whoever shared that detail in the community I love you. I brought my old pillow pet as a kid and folded it in half with the Velcro… it fit so well and worked so well too and was a cute little buddy on the way home. 

-I bought Gas X but don’t think I’ll have to use it, still is good to have on hand I think! 

- Also forgive me if I ask or said anything dumb or obvious, also forgive me if I repeated anything, I’m just journaling my thoughts I have so far with this experience freely. 

- Just going to wait until insurance attempts to bill me to pop out an appeal letter (if necessary) but really hoping and expecting  that everything will go as planned and be 100% covered, ACA come thru. (I have BCBS)

- Remember you are not alone and this community here is full of people who support you. I am so grateful for everyone here, I wouldn’t have been so confident otherwise and calm going in, thank you all. 

TL;DR- Bisalp done today and it went better than I ever could have imagined. If yours is coming up or you’re thinking about doing it, absolutely go for it! I hope that sharing my experience will help at least one person in some way, and I’d be happy to answer any questions.

However, I rarely see any Brazilian coffees as specialty coffee roasted for pourover internationally. I sometimes come across of a bag of Catuai but that's it. Also on this subreddit, most people seem to tend toward Ethiopian, Colombian, and Central American beans.

What is the reason that there are such few Brazilian specialty coffees roasted for pourover? Maragogipe and Arara are amazing for example. 

I could be answering my own question here, but does it have something to do with Brazil being more industrialized? I have visited coffee farms in both Colombia and Brazil, and the Brazilian farms are generally huge and feel more like outdoor factories.

I'm looking for a roommate to move into a 2 bedroom apartment in Lower Allston that I have lived in for the last 5 years with someone else. Here are the details:

* **Location:** Lower Allston, close to many parks, Trader joes, HBS, Star market, restaurants, public transit (66, 86, 70 within 5m, red/green line about a 15 minute walk).
* **Availability:** 2/1 would be the move in date, upon moving in the landlord would like us to sign a new lease that would run until 7/31.
* **Rent:** $1200/month + utilities (usually \~$160 depending on season).
* **About the Apartment:** Spacious 2 bedroom with a full living, dining and kitchen space. Washer and dryer are in the unit. Street parking is typically available. The bedroom available isn't huge but has a great closet and the apartment has a good amount of space. It's an older apartment but i've much enjoyed the time I've spent here. Photos are of the furnished room but it would not come furnished (TBD depending on what the person moving out takes).
* **About Me:** I'm 31 year old guy, I quit my full-time job last year to pursue an undergraduate degree while I work at a local coffee shop. I'm pretty quiet, clean and laid back. I love to cook, take long walks and watch the NY knicks! I don't drink or smoke but do enjoy the 420.
* **About You:** Looking for a non-smoking someone who is clean, respectful and easy-going. The apartment is not a place for parties but the occasional hang is fine.
* **Pets:** I have a cat that is extremely cute but also very hyper so cat-lover is a must!

If you're interested or have any questions, feel free to DM me! I’d be happy to share more pictures and info.

1hxlsr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FearsToFathom/comments/1hxlsr2/the_note/,The Note. ,"The odds of people believing my story is slim. But I know what happened. It was the first apartment I’d ever rented by myself. A small one-bedroom on the edge of town, cheap and unassuming. The kind of place you move into when you're fresh out of college and working your first real job. It wasn’t much, but it was mine. That’s what I kept telling myself to drown out the creaks, groans, and eerie silences that filled the space.

I never thought much of it when I first moved in. The landlord mentioned that the previous tenant had left suddenly, breaking the lease. ""Life happens,"" he had said with a shrug. I should’ve asked more questions.

It started with the lights. Every now and then, they’d flicker. I chalked it up to old wiring. But then, the lights in the kitchen began turning off completely—always around 11:15 PM. Not before, not after. Just... gone. No matter how much I fiddled with the switch, they wouldn’t come back on until the next morning.

One night, I stayed up late on the couch watching TV, a mug of cold tea in my hand. The kitchen light flickered, dimmed, and then shut off as usual. I ignored it. But then, I heard it—a faint rustling noise. It sounded like someone was going through my cabinets. My heart jumped into my throat.

I grabbed my phone, turned on the flashlight, and slowly walked into the kitchen. Nothing. No one. Everything was exactly as I left it. Just the wind, I told myself, though the windows were shut tight.

A week later, I started noticing my belongings were... out of place. A pair of shoes I always kept by the door appeared in the bathroom. My keys, which I left on the counter, showed up on my bedside table. And then there were the photographs.

I’m not much of a photographer, but I had a few Polaroids of friends and family pinned on the fridge. One morning, I noticed something strange—one of the photos had been replaced. It was a picture I’d never taken: the kitchen at night, with the fridge door slightly open.

I stared at it for what felt like hours. Who could’ve taken this? The door was always locked, and I lived alone. I called the landlord, asking if there was any chance someone else had a key. He assured me there wasn’t. But his voice wavered slightly, like he wasn’t telling me the whole truth.

The following Friday, I decided to stay somewhere else for the weekend—just to clear my head. I was packing my bag when I heard it: the unmistakable sound of footsteps coming from the hallway outside my bedroom.

I froze. The footsteps stopped just outside my door. I reached for my phone, but before I could dial 911, the door creaked open—just a crack. The air turned icy cold. I held my breath, waiting, listening. Then, the door slammed shut, hard enough to rattle the walls.

I flung the door open, my heart pounding. The hallway was empty. I checked every room, every closet, but found nothing. And yet, I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone or something was watching me.

The breaking point came two nights later. I woke up around 3 AM to the sound of faint whispering. At first, I thought it was coming from outside, but it was too clear, too close. I followed the sound to the living room. The whispers stopped as soon as I entered.

On the coffee table was a note written in shaky, scrawled handwriting. It read:
“GET OUT. SHE SEES YOU.”

I packed a bag and left that night. I didn’t care that I had nowhere to go. I drove to a friend’s place and didn’t say a word about what had happened. The next day, I called the landlord to break my lease. He didn’t argue.

A month later, I learned the truth. The previous tenant hadn’t left voluntarily. She’d disappeared. Her belongings were still in the apartment when the police conducted their investigation, but no trace of her was ever found.

To this day, I don’t know what I experienced in that apartment. I don’t know who “she” was, or why she was watching me. But I know one thing for sure: some doors are better left unopened.

And some homes should remain empty.",1,1736453018.0,FearsToFathom,0,1.0,False

He said he washed it.

I said “with dish soap?” and he said yes.

I got up and walked to the kitchen, to find a very dry sponge. I called him out on it and he admitted he lied. I asked him why, and he said he didn’t know. Maybe that I wouldn’t have drank it if I knew it wasn’t washed first - which was the whole entire point of me asking.

I asked because I didn’t want to drink out of a dirty cup, so he decides to lie instead. And I tried to explain why him lying three straight times to my face, might be upsetting. And he doesn’t understand.

1hxlozc,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hxlozc/why_is_caffeine_way_harder_to_handle_after_you/,Why is caffeine way harder to handle after you quit,"I am not someone who is trying to quit coffee, I successfully quit drinking coffee almost 2 years ago, around summer of 2023.

I am currently 18 years old by the way, I started drinking coffee occasionally when I was 15 and became a daily drinker at 16 and then carried that on until I was close to turning 17.

There's a common belief that fully grown adults can handle caffeine better than children or teenagers. But coffee was way easier on my system when I was a teenager.

I tried a small amount of coffee for the first time when I was around 8 years old and I will admit it gave me jitters, but I was way too young back then. Then my first official full cup of coffee I was 15 that I tried out of curiosity, it didn't give me jitters at all. It made my mood way better and gave me energy this time, which broke my initial fear I had of coffee since all I could remember was how I felt after trying it as a kid.

So fast forward to 2023, the reason I quit coffee is because I just wanted to see what life was like without it. My sleep improved, I felt way calmer and a whole bunch of other benefits came along.

Since then, for some reason even a small glass of soda (which is very low in caffeine compared to coffee) sends me into panic and makes me prone to anxiety. I will be shaking, concerned, heart palpitations, looking around me, struggling to sleep, ect.

Now I'm a very caffeine sensitive person, which is a bummer because in social situations I'm gonna have to be the one guy who asks for a bottle of water or orange juice.

But I literally cannot have caffeine anymore, it's like poison to my body now. I only feel mentally sane when I stick to zero caffeine. Otherwise I act like a 14 year old girl who needs to get therapy for her anxiety.

So. I just want to know if anybody else had a similar experience. But I've sworn off it for good, for the rare case that I do have some caffeine it will be soda again since I do enjoy it. Not touching coffee or tea. Even higher in caffeine.",2,1736452768.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I know I said all SFX are optional, but if I might be so bold as to make a request...

Keep the rain.



For the listener:

*College got over, life got in the way, and you now have to leave the city to return home. That means saying goodbye to your girlfriend. She was your first crush, and you're still in love. Why are farewells so difficult? You're sitting inside her car now, reflecting on your journey together and struggling to fill with words what might be your last conversation with her.*

...

**SCRIPT:**



*(SFX: Rain)*

You’ve had a crush on me since the first semester...?

Wow, dude- that is- (giggling)- I’m so flattered! But it’s a little weird saying that to your girlfriend now, don’t you think?

We’ve been together for over two years. How come I’m only hearing about this now?

You felt shy...? (Sighing) You realize we have- we have done stuff, right? Stuff involving handcuffs, and ropes, and- never mind. I’m trying to keep this wholesome.

I just mean to say- we’ve shared a lot of moments together. I trust you more than anybody else in the world. Even if this is where we decide to call it quits, you’re still my best friend. That won’t change.

I…I need you to believe that, alright?

(Smiling sadly) Good boy.

This- this still feels surreal to me, you know? I have your collar on my lap. I’m still playing with the clasp. Running my fingers along the leather. It’s still warm.

I can’t believe I won’t be able to put this around your neck again.

I was your first crush?

(Smiling warmly) That’s so sweet. Thank you...pet.

(Giggling a bit) What? I can still call you that until you- (ever so quietly)- until you walk out of my car for the last time.

(A longer pause)

Pet, do you remember when we got this collar?

Yeah. At the end of our second date. I took you to the pet store and let you choose your favourite one. The girl at the counter was bored, and she asked us about our dog. And I said, “Oh no, it’s for him.” (Giggling)

The look on your face! It was- (stifling giggles)- it was just like the one you’re making right now! (Calming herself) Oh...oh my gosh.

It really has been two years since then, huh?

It’s kind of weird, you know? We have been friends for so long. We’ve sat together through so many classes, gone on so many little adventures in the city. You’ve come to mean so many things to me over these last few years. And I-I really did think I’d always have you around.

Tomorrow’s going to be the first day in years that I won’t see you. It’s- well, surreal, like I said.

Yeah. It doesn’t feel real. And knowing you, you’re probably just going to crack a goofy smile and say, (mock-heavy voice) *“Wake up to reality”*, or something.

It’s from some anime about ninjas, isn’t it?

*Shinobi?* Oh, okay! Let’s not get carried away now. Nerd. (Another giggle)

I know you don’t want me to be sad. And that’s why you always pretend you aren’t, either. But you don’t have to do that anymore, okay? There are some things we *should* be sad about.

Oh, you know like what. Like learning Santa isn’t real, or like having to become an adult and pay rent on your own, or like knowing this is the final season of your favourite TV series. Or like...you know, saying goodbye to the person you love.

Babe...I’m alright. I promise. I just-

(Sighing) Thanks. I like it when you hold my hand.

(Faintly) Thank you.

I too wish things had been different. But here we are. Sitting in my car, parked in the shadow of our old academic block, with nothing outside but streetlights and rain.

You made college fun, you know? Thanks for always having my back.

So um, have you finished packing all your stuff yet, or...?

Oh. I see. Yeah, you did mention you need to leave early tomorrow. Back to your hometown huh?

You sure you’ve grown tired of the city? I mean, this city is pretty big. I’ve lived here for most of my life, and even I haven’t explored half the neighbourhoods and coffee shops and- and those new shopping malls they’re building in the west. There are still so many restaurants where we could order dishes we don’t even know how to pronounce, and so many hidden nooks and alleyways where we can search for stray cats to make friends with.

It’s a big city. You sure I can’t persuade you to stay?

(Sighing) You don’t have to look at me with such guilt. I was only being half serious, my pet.

I know you’ve always had plans to go back. The small town blues are strong with you. (A sad little laugh)

Do you know when you’ll be back?

(Quietly) I see.

No, it’s okay- really. I don’t blame you. It’s good not to make plans in advance- life has a way of derailing them. When you really wish for something that’s beyond your control- imagine a piece of paper. Smooth and blank. Write down your wish on that paper, and just tuck it away in a drawer deep inside your heart. Fate won’t be able to see what you wrote, if you do that.

What happens after that? Well, I like to think someday- when you’re ready- you’ll be able to locate that drawer again, and pull out that piece of paper. And then, hopefully, what you wrote will have stayed the same.

Don’t abandon hope, is what I’m trying to say. I don’t think Dante was being serious when he- you know, when he wrote that poem.

Of course. Even if you are in hell, you still have to hold on to hope. Hope is the only thing which outlives time.

Well, I think it’s true. I mean- I have hope I’ll see you again one day, even if it takes time. Someday, I’ll slip this collar around your neck again, my darling.

Yeah, I know. I’m going to miss you too. We agreed not to make this emotional, but honestly- (sighing a bit shakily)- it’s...it’s kinda hard to do that.

I keep wondering if we could’ve prevented this. Found some compromise, made some choice differently. But I can’t leave the city for long, and you can’t stay for more than a while. And we can’t do one of those long distance things- that’d only cause you more pain. And you’re not alone in that.

*(SFX: Gentle hair brushing)*

To see my puppy and still be unable to play with his hair...to gently scratch his scalp with my nails...be unable to cup his cheek like this, and fluster him with my kisses...I can’t do that to myself.

If I can’t have all of you to myself, then I...I...

(The two of them share a few small kisses)

*(SFX: A car passing by)*

(Smiling, fragile) I just love you so much, you know...? (Inhaling, exhaling) Between the city mouse and the country mouse, I really wish you could’ve picked the city mouse. But that’s just life, always getting in the way. Making sand out of our sandcastles.

*(Hair brushing stops)*

You sure you don’t want me to drive you back to your apartment? It’s raining outside.

But it is raining quite heavily. And I really don’t mind burning some petrol.

(Sighing) If you’re so convinced that’d make it even harder to say goodbye...oh, well. At least make sure to use that umbrella. Don’t catch a cold, okay?

I’m being serious, pet. You’ll have to learn to take better care of yourself now. I...(soft) I won’t be around to take care of you anymore. (Softer) Even if I really want to.

Don’t catch a cold...alright?

Good boy.

You wish we had more time…? But we did, my darling. It just passed by too quickly. Time is relative.

Oh, the passage of time is *especially* relative. Time can crawl, walk, run, fly, or stand still. It depends entirely on what you’re going through.

Hm? For whom does time crawl...? Ah, well, I see you still take what I say all too seriously. (Giggling a bit)

For whom does it crawl? Hm. I wonder.

Perhaps, for college students between exams. The seconds turn into minutes, the minutes into hours, and the nights into eternity. Time just can’t pass us by quickly enough.

Really? You think it passes *too* quickly before an exam? (Giggling) Well, sure- if you *want* to study, there’s not enough time. But if you can’t wait for exams to get over, then time really drags, you know? There’s just no end to the suffering.

Oh, it wasn’t like that for me. I had you during exams. We’d spend the evenings at the library, studying and talking and- and even cuddling a bit (giggling). I *wish* time would’ve crawled. I wanted our study dates to last longer, you know?

We’re still playing this game, huh? You really want to know for whom time walks?

(Sighing) It walks for lovers on a lunch date. I never felt like checking what the time was, when the two of us were at Denny’s for a burger, or having those crisp sandwiches and fresh coffee at the plaza. Time just...it passed at just the right pace, you know? There was no rush. Just a glint in your eyes, and mustard sauce on your chin. (Muttering softly) Every single time. I just couldn’t teach my puppy to eat properly.

Oh, don’t worry. Someday I’ll be collecting what you owe me for all those napkins I wasted on you. (Tiny giggle)

For whom does time run? Well, it ran for me when I sneaked into your hotel room on that college trip. You know- the one in fifth semester? My heart was running too- hundred miles a minute- in case somebody somehow discovered us. But you know me. I like taking risks.

Oh, we did *more* than just cuddle that night, pet. Don’t get all shy on me now. It’s a little too late for that.

(Sultry laughter) Still makes you blush, huh? How cute. But yeah, it was fun. Time ran by too quickly- I didn’t even realize when the sun had come up.

For whom does it fly? My sweet boy…do you remember what last summer was like? Everything was right with the world. Everything was just so perfect, so idyllic. Not a care or hint of worry. (Wistful) We went to my lake house, we boated on the crystal blue waters together and listened to the birds singing. We went to the beach, and barbecued on the shore. We- We even went to that lovely shrine festival in the hills, all the way out in the countryside. I didn’t know firecrackers came in so many colours!

Last summer was the best time of my life. Time really flew! It was like, all summer was gone in a day.

I’m glad I took so many pictures though. At least...at least I’ll have those with me, right?

*(SFX: A pause, followed by a passing car)*

For whom does time stand still…? What do you think, puppy?

Hasn’t it been standing still for us?

It feels like time has only just started ticking again. I couldn’t hear it ticking for these last two years. But now, I...I can hear it. It’s jarring. Discordant. But it’s relentless, and it won’t stop ticking.

(Quietly) I was wrong earlier, you know? We haven’t had enough time. We just never seem to have enough of it.

But, I-I’ve kept you long enough. (Breathing audibly- unsteadily) You have a long journey tomorrow, don’t you? You should get some rest.

Don’t forget your umbrella. If you won’t let me drive you home, then at least make sure you get home safe.

(Soft) My puppy’s all grown up...I know you can take care of yourself, pet, but I still worry...

Yeah. You too. And listen- I know we agreed on a clean break, but do you think you could send me a postcard during the holidays?

At least then I’ll know you’re safe, and happy.

Good. Thanks.

Yeah, I…yes. Take care of yourself. I really do wish you the very best.

*(SFX: Car door opening)*

Have a lovely night.

*(Rain sounds continue. No dialogue.)*

(Speaking quietly to herself)

Have a lovely night...? What am I, his boss? His colleague? A stranger?

Are those going to be my last words to him...? Have a lovely night...? Why did I say that?

Why did I allow him to go?

(Emotional) You...you’re really leaving me...but I still have your collar. I still...I still haven’t...where are you going? I can see you’re struggling to walk.

Aren’t you going to turn back? It’s raining. It’s not like you can make out the tears from that distance.

I can’t see yours either, from this distance. Are you really not going to turn back?

Am I- Am I just going to let him walk out of my life like this?

*(SFX: Car door closing)*

Why does it have to end this way? I should’ve made him stay. I should never have let go of his leash. Of his hand, in mine. Should’ve...should’ve made him stay.

I can’t put up with this feeling. If only I had done things differently. Then it...it wouldn’t have come to this.

If only I had...if only...

(Normal voice, to listener)

Stay.

You heard me. I don’t care if I’m getting drenched in the rain. I’m not letting you go.

Stay. Stay with me.

I don’t care, pet. We’ll figure it out. We always have. I don’t want to be mature about this. I can’t be. I...I’m too selfish for that.

I’m not okay with this. I’m not! I don’t want you to go.

I’m still your Mistress. And you’re my puppy. You have to obey me. You promised you’d obey me. Have you forgotten?

Yes, dummy! Of course I mean it! Why wouldn’t I? You...you’re the boy I love. (Kissing him)

(Whispering fervently) I’m not letting you go, I’m not...you’re mine...I won’t let you be on your own, I won’t allow it...I won’t...won’t let you do this...I won’t...

(Soft) Stay with me, puppy. Please. Just...

Stay.

*(The rain is gone.)*

..

...

(A few seconds of silence)

(Sleepily) Puppy...?

What’s the matter with you? (Groaning softly) It’s almost 3 AM. Why’re you staring up at the ceiling like that?

Hello? Hey, are you even listening? Puppy.

(Sighing) Both of us have work tomorrow morning. Shouldn’t you be sleeping?

Hm? What was that?

Just reliving a memory...? Oh, how sweet. But can you please not do this at 3 AM? It’s weird.

Yeah. It is. I turn around, and I see you staring up at the ceiling unblinking and I- I get weirded out, alright? Just let me cuddle you back to sleep.

I wasn’t asking, pet. Get in here. *Now*.

(Sighing) There we go. Isn’t this better?

Such a good boy for Mistress. (Pecking him) Yes, you are. Now go back to dreaming of me while I hold you.

(Sleepily) Mhmn. So obedient...I knew I chose well...there’s a good puppy.

Ssshh. Don’t...don’t move around so much. Just relax. I’ve got you. Nuzzle into me, and try to fall asleep. I’ll keep holding you.

That’s my darling.

(Soft, slow breathing)

(Whispering) I told you I’d slip this collar around your neck again someday.

1hxlkqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hxlkqu/breakdown_of_my_first_1010_cup_an_abstract/,Breakdown of my first 10/10 cup: An Abstract,"Background: I got into pourovers maybe a decade ago with a chemex, a stovetop kettle, and no knowledge of coffee brewing at all. I made mostly 5/10 cups. When the chemex broke I started grad school six and ahalf years ago, I switched to a Bonavita machine. I exclusively brewed using that (and sometimes cold brew) up until two months ago, when my I bought a Kalita Tsubame Wave 155 and Fellow Stagg to accompany my Fellow Opus. Since then I've been making usually two cups a day using a variety of beans. Quality has ranged from 4-out-of-10 to about 8.5-out-of-10. Here, I wanted to detail what I feel is my first 10-out-of-10 pour over cup.

Methods: I brewed this cup of coffee (n = 1) using a Fellow Opus grinder, a Fellow Stagg electric kettle, a Kalita Tsubame Wave 155 flat bottom dripper, Kalita Wave 155 filter papers, a Greater Goods coffee scale, and a Jewish Currents subscriber mug. I used Shirafushi Coffee Roaster's Ethiopia Geisha (anaerobic natural), roasted on November 1, 2024 and brought back to the US from Japan on November 8th, 2024. As with all coffee at my rental, I used LA tap water run through an under-sink Omnipure Q5633 and then chilled in a Britta pitcher in my refrigerator. 

I ground 16g coffee at a 7.2 on the Opus' external adjustment ring, with no adjustment made to the internal ring. I received 16.1g coffee out. For this cup I rinsed the filter paper with 85°C water as the kettle was approaching final temperature. I poured the grounds into the dripper and gently shook to even the bed. I then bloomed the coffee with 30g of 90°C water for 30 seconds. At 30 seconds I poured 100g of water in a clockwise spiral from the center out from a height of approximately 10cm. At 1:30 I poured 70g of 90°C water in the same pattern. At 2:15 I poured a final 30g of water in a clockwise ring around the outside of the bed and then gave a gentle shake. Final time was 2:50. Final ratio was 1:14.4. I waited for three minutes before my first sip, and continued to sip as the cup cooled to room temperature. 

Results: Using the above method, I produced an exceptionally clean, sweet cup. Texturally, the coffee was rich, creamy, and smooth on my tongue, reminiscent of a very low-viscosity syrup. The aroma was lightly floral with subtle hint of Rosé. I detected no bitterness in this cup and extremely little acidity. I felt the flavor was both deep and rich, yet mellow and not overpowering in any single direction. For my limited palate, the flavor notes might equate to wine or balanced sake, hibiscus, and gentle citrus. 

Conclusions: Purely by luck, I brewed a cup that I'm unusually proud of. Shirafushi produced a phenomenal batch of coffee, and I feel that I managed to brew it to its full potential with this cup. I doubt I'll be able to replicate it precisely, and I have enough coffee left for about two more cups of this size. In conclusion, if you can find Shirafushi beans, you owe it to yourself to try them. The brew very well with a flat-bottom dripper, and this batch was enhanced by a lower brew temperature. My Jewish Currents subscriber mug was the perfect vessel for this brew.

About a year and a half ago I took over operations of the farm and decided to export our coffee. In partnership with my uncle - a life long farmer - we’ve been working hard at creating a delightful product.

I’m proud to share that our coffee is now being bought green by a roaster in New Hampshire, and also roasted (which we do at origin) by shops in Washington, DC. 

We are seeing great results for our buyers, with terrific feedback by their clients.

Direct trade can be a reality for those who give it a chance. And I believe we are particularly well equipped to work together with those who are interested in going that route.

If you have been contemplating on whether to take the chance and would like to learn more, please reach out. I’m happy to have a conversation and tell you how we work. In general, I’m also always happy to connect with people and share any lessons.

Wishing you all the best in 2025!

I'm fairly new to ordering from aliexpress but since today it's been going really well and I've been really happy with all my orders. 

Anyway basically I ordered a timemore black mirror 2 scale from one seller, and a timemore B75 coffee brewer from another seller (both have very good ratings). 

Both orders had the exact same order and tracking numbers, except I only received the black mirror scale. The B75 coffee brewer was put as ""delivered"" but I never received it. 

I have contacted Evri and I am awaiting their response, I've also contacted the seller but it looks like basically I need to sort this with Evri. Luckily this coffee brewer is fairly cheap, but I am just baffled as to where my order went? 

Do you have any advice or experience with this sort of issue?

## Installation

You can add **OctoPalm.js** to your project using one of two methods:

### 1. Via CDN

Add the following CDN link to the `<head>` of your HTML:

```html
<script src=""https://aidalog.github.io/cdn/light/octopalm.ladybug.js""></script>
```

### 2. Download from GitHub

1. Download the latest version from the [OctoPalm GitHub Repository](https://github.com/eddiegulay/octopalm).
2. Include the `octopalm.ladybug.js` file in your project:

```html
<script src=""/path/to/octopalm.ladybug.js""></script>
```

## Usage

### 1. HTML Setup

Create an input field where users can type their search queries:

```html
<input type=""text"" id=""search-input"" placeholder=""Search..."" />
```

### 2. Initialize OctoPalm.js

Add the following script to initialize the search functionality:

```html
<script src=""/path/to/octopalm.ladybug.js""></script>
<script>
    // Example items for a shopping site
    const items = [
        { label: ""Car Cover"", link: ""/accessories/car-cover"", emoji: ""🚔"" },
        { label: ""Helmet"", link: ""/accessories/helmet"", emoji: ""🪖"" },
        { name: ""Bike"", link: ""/vehicles/bike"" },
        { label: ""Scooter"", link: ""/vehicles/scooter"", emoji: ""🛵"" },
        // Add more items as needed...
    ];

    // Initialize OctoPalm with the input ID and items
    new OctoPalm('search-input', items);
</script>
```

### 3. Customizing Styles

The library injects default styles for search results. You can modify these styles by updating the CSS in `octopalm.js` or by overriding them in your own stylesheet:

```css
.opalm-search-results {
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
}
```

## API

### Constructor

```javascript
new OctoPalm(inputId, items)
```

- **`inputId`**: The ID of the input element where users will type their search queries.
- **`items`**: An array of items to search through. Each item should be an object containing at least one search key (e.g., `itemName`, `label`, `emoji`) and a corresponding `link`.

### Example

```javascript
const items = [
    { itemName: ""Example Item"", link: ""/example-item"" },
    { label: ""Car Cover"", link: ""/accessories/car-cover"", emoji: ""🚔"" }
];
new OctoPalm('search-input', items);
```

### Key Search Properties

Each item in the `items` array can have one or more of the following properties:

- **`itemName`**: The name of the item to be displayed (e.g., `""Toyota Camry""`).
- **`label`**: Another possible label for the item (e.g., `""Car Cover""`).
- **`emoji`**: An emoji that will be displayed alongside the item's label.
- **`link`**: A URL where the user will be redirected when they click the search result.

## Examples

Here’s an example of a simple shopping search implementation:

```html
<input type=""text"" id=""search-input"" placeholder=""Search products..."" />
<script>
    const items = [
        { label: ""Car Cover"", link: ""/accessories/car-cover"", emoji: ""🚔"" },
        { label: ""Helmet"", link: ""/accessories/helmet"", emoji: ""🪖"" },
        { name: ""Scooter"", link: ""/vehicles/scooter"", emoji: ""🛵"" },
        // Add more items...

so I’m stuck in a weird little social paradox. Where the other option is the wrong move in both cases…

anybody have any advice. Do I just stop overthinking and text her, or what?

* Producer: Inacio Urban
* Farm: Fazenda Rio Brilhante
* Altitude: 950–1,100m
* Processing: Natural
* Variety: Arara

**Observations:**

* **Aroma:** Very subtle, which surprised me since it’s naturally processed—I was expecting a stronger fruity aroma. Maybe it’s more developed, which might explain the muted scent.
* **Taste:** Clean cup with medium acidity, no bitterness, and no unpleasant flavors like burnt notes or overly strong acidity. It didn’t disappoint—very delicious, even after cooling! I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to brew another cup right after finishing the first one.
* This was my first time trying the Arara variety, and I’ll definitely keep an eye out for it in the future \^\_\^

WAKE UP  
I wake up at 4:35 am and i’m at the gym by 5am so i don’t have enough time to eat and digest before i get on the treadmill. Therefore, since i DON’T drink coffee, I drink a tea called Yerba Mate. I boil a pot of it at night and put it in a tall glass or pitcher and let it cool down in the fridge overnight. In the morning, I start drinking it right when I wake up so that I have energy by the time I get to the gym. Yerba Mate can be found online or at grocery stores and most brands are good. I love it because it is a NATURAL source of great energy perfect before a workout.  
  
BREAKFAST  
After my workout, I head to my 6:30 morning meeting and I drink a 16 oz bottle of water with lemon and a pinch of cayenne pepper in it. This is a great way to wake up your body and get it ready for the food you will soon put into it. I sip my hot green or oolong tea(teagarden.com) from Dr. Tea’s Garden. He is on Melrose Blvd at a place called Tea Garden and before my wedding he had me drinking various slimming teas like oolong and another he made for me called Ti Kwan Yin Oolong. I believe Dr. Tea is moving locations, so I am going to start ordering off his website (teagarden.com) I drink two to three cups a day. I have gotten a few people at work on tea (instead of coffee) and they looove it!!! Coffee can actually hold onto fat whereas green and oolong tea flushes fat out (love that). At this time, I also open up a bottle of GT’s Kombucha in Citrus or Gingerade flavor (gtskombucha.com) I’m also loving the Gingerberry flavor which tastes the best of the three. I sip this throughout the day because it is very good for you and it totally helps with hunger cravings. (see below under Drinks for more info)  
  
At about 7:15am I have an ORGANIC grapefruit. This is an amazing fruit that helps keep you regular and also helps flush out fat. Then I have either an egg white omelet with veggies and herbs (i like to add things like spinach (always) mushrooms, asparagus, broccoli, onions, cilantro, herbs, and tomatoes, sometimes a little grilled chicken breast or turkey breast) I alternate veggies depending on what i’m in the mood for but i always do spinach. So good for you. And i ALWAYS say NO BUTTER, NO OIL…instead tell them to cook it in a light mist of Pam cooking spray. Tell them your allergic to butter so that they don’t slip it in there like a lot of places do. If they don’t have Pam spray, then tell them to use just a DROP or two of Oil!!! If you don’t like omelets, you can also do the same ingredients in a scramble or a frittata…once again, Pam spray or a drop of oil…NO BUTTER!!!  
  
MID-MORNING SNACK  
Between breakfast and lunch, my favorite snack in the world is Kashi’s TLC bars in Honey Almond Flax or Cherry Dark Chocolate. I am obsessed with these!!! They are my favorite health bar because they are yummy, low in sugar and all natural. No high fructose corn syrup (the devil) in these puppies!!! I buy them at any grocery store. Kashi is an amazing brand and I love their cereals and oatmeals as well. I always have a Kashi TLC bar or two in my bag and I keep a box at home and at work so that I always have a healthy snack around. Keeps you from running to the vending machine (which you should avoid like the plague, by the way.)  
  
LUNCH  
I never have time to leave the office for lunch so I usually order a chicken breast from Koo Koo Roo (the local chicken chain restaurant across the street from E!). I get a rotisserie chicken breast and I eat around the skin or just peel it off and toss it out before I take one bite. The skin is full of fat and nasty for you! I get a large side of steamed broccoli on the side. Lately, I’ve been bringing my own frozen veggies to work and making them in the microwave. I prefer broccoli, asparagus, cauliflower, spinach, red and green peppers. Then I sprinkle some bottled herbs on them and I have a yummy lunch. I follow lunch with an apple or another grapefruit OR I will have another Kashi bar to get some whole grain carbs in there if I am craving carbs. Better than eating white pita or bread. If i’m bored of chicken, I try to get a salmon bowl with brown rice and steamed veggies at whole foods. Or I will get a healthy chicken salad, no wontons or fried stuff in it. I have them toss it LIGHTLY in balsamic vinaigrette which is healthier than most other dressings.  
  
MID-AFTERNOON SNACK  
If I’ve only had one Kashi bar, then I will have another as a snack to hold me over to dinner. Sometimes I will eat a Kashi and an organic apple (pink lady and honey crisp are my fads.) That way I get good carbs and satisfy my sweet tooth in a healthy way. Sometimes I will stop and get a fresh squeezed veggie juice made of carrots, beets, cucumbers, broccoli, kale, ginger and lemon (those ingredients aren’t always available so my rule is usually, the greener the veggie, the better).  
  
DINNER  
I love sushi so I try to eat at sushi restaurants that serve brown rice sushi (call around…more and more sushi joints are doing this). Otherwise, I will order some albacore and/or salmon sashimi and a couple of rolls (no tempura, no mayo) and sauce on the side. (those yummy brown sauces are full of sugar). Instead, put a little low-sodium soy sauce on your sushi. I don’t use anything sauces at all…I love the rolls and sashimi the way they are. When I go to restaurants, I try to order dishes like grilled chicken breast, grilled fish like halibut, all types of white fish, salmon, hay tuna. I always order steamed veggies, no butter and no oil. if they can’t steam them then tell them you want a touch of oil…stress a touch…otherwise your veggies will be swimming in a pool of oil!!! You can’t go wrong with ordering grilled fish and steamed veggies (especially if you are trying to lose or maintain your weight.) I try not to eat bread or pasta or anything made with white sugar and white flour but I end up having it about once or twice a week.  
  
DESSERT  
I looooove dessert but I used to love it too much. So much so that I had to completely cut it out for a while. Now, I will have a bite here or there but I find it is easier to just pass instead of getting that sugar in your bloodstream and then going nuts and chowing down the whole pie. Instead, I order berries after dinner or some sort of fruit. Your body and mind registers the (healthy) sugar and your craving goes away!!! I used to be obsessed with Frozen Yogurt but I found that it is better on your body and weight to have a scoop of real ice cream than a cup of frozen yogurt since the fro yo is all chemicals and your body doesn’t digest it properly.  
  
DRINKS  
When I get to the office, first thing I do is take a water bottle and sprinkle some cayenne pepper (just a tiny pinch…if you go overboard, it will be impossible to drink) and I squeeze the juice from half a lemon (save the other half for later.) The cayenne and lemon combo totally revs up your metabolism and gets it going.  
  
As I mentioned before, I am a big green tea and oolong tea junkie. So good for you!  
  
I am a huge fan of Kombucha. The brand I love is GT’s Kombucha at Whole Foods. My favorite flavor is Citrus. Second favorite is the Gingerade flavor. I am loving the Gingerberry flavor as well…yummy!!! Each serving is only 30 calories, no fat, 7 carbs and 2 grams of sugar (natural sugar) and there are two servings per bottle so this drink is super healthy and super low cal:) I usually sip one bottle a day throughout the morning and afternoon. It aids with digestion, speeds up metabolism, helps make your skin and hair healthy, and is super good for your body…plus, it totally helps with appetite control. No joke!!! This is great for me since sometimes I eat totally out of boredom (which i’m sure a lot of you can relate to) so instead, i sip this and then i’m not “fake” hungry anymore because it totally hits the spot. I’m obsessed with it!!! It is a bit pricey but I hear you can get cheaper ones at various health stores or even make it yourself at home! I’m not that brave yet…maybe one day:)  
  
I love stopping by a Juice bar and getting a veggie juice filled with super healthy veggies like spinach, kale, broccoli, beets, cucumber, etc. I add ginger, lemon and parsely when available. This is a terrific snack to have between meals and rather filling too. You will not get fat on raw and steamed veggies!  
  
CHEAT FOOD  
Of course I cheat sometimes (I’m human, after all) but i try to limit the cheating to once a week and once I cheat, i don’t say “Oh to hell with it, I’ve cheated so now i’m gonna stuff my face and get back on track tomorrow.” This is a terrible and dangerous attitude and something I used to do all the time. Instead, now I will enjoy the “cheat” food by having a little bit of it and giving the rest away. For instance, if i just MUST have pasta, I will let my husband order it and have some bites of his. Or I will order a healthy dish and ask for a half order of the pasta (no cream, ever!) on the side. I will eat half of the side of pasta and pass the rest around the table so my friends can try it to. That way you are impressing the table with your generosity and cutting lots of calories:) I know this is easier said than done but it all depends on how badly you want to change your eating habits and the way you look.  
  
SWEETENERS  
I was that girl who used to put 3 Equals in her coffee. Well, I’ve quit coffee (yes, coffee is bad for you) and I stopped putting all artificial sweeteners into my body. My taste buds have totally changed and now I don’t need sweeteners at all on my food. If something calls for sugar, I opt for a little natural honey…but even that is rare. Or sometimes I sprinkle Stevia (all natural sugar substitute) on my cereal or greek yogurt if I need that extra sweetness, but once again, that is rare since I overcame my sugar cravings!  
  
TIP  
The secret to losing or maintaining weight and being healthy is to never go hungry. Anytime I’m hungry, I munch on a Kashi TLC bar (even half and put the other half away for a later snack) or I have an apple, grapefruit or some strawberries, or I have a veggie juice from a health store/bar, or I sip on Kombucha. As you know, almonds are a great snack too but I have had to limit almonds because I just can’t stop after a palmful of almonds. I end up eating the whole jar!!! And that adds up to tons of calories. They now sell raw almonds in individual 100 calorie bags….good solution for a healthy snack.",2,1736451446.0,redscarepod,1,1.0,False

1hxl52i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hxl52i/i_underwent_surgery_for_a_brain_implant_and_now/,I underwent surgery for a brain implant and now I'm dealing with strange side effects.,"The surgery wasn't as painful as I had anticipated. I awoke in an uncomfortable hospital bed—covered in cheap, scratchy sheets— and almost immediately began running my fingers across the bumpy sutures on the back of my head. The incision was smaller than I’d anticipated. It couldn't have been more than an inch or so, just above the nape of my neck. ""Stop touching it"" scolded Dr. Adams. I hadn't noticed him standing across from me, just on the other side of the bed. His sterile, white coat was well camouflaged against the walls of the sterile, white room. I jumped at the sudden interjection, which caused my head to pulse. Distracted by my now throbbing skull, and by the lingering effects of anesthesia, I didn't realize that he had continued speaking.

""Do you understand what I'm telling you, John?"" asked Dr. Adams, though I could tell by the tone of his voice that he was aware I hadn't heard a single word he had said to me. I stared at him blankly, occasionally blinking my eyes a little too hard as I adjusted to the bright fluorescent lights. He sighed. ""It will take a few days for your brain to adjust to the implant. Don't panic when it doesn't work right away, okay? John?”

I nodded. He seemed satisfied with this response. ""Good. The world might look a little fuzzy to you for a day or two. Once your brain accepts the implant, which it will, the implant will learn to process visual inputs and produce appropriate and accurate outputs. Sound good?” Again, I nodded, trying my best to look invested in what he was saying.

“I will continue to follow up with you every other week for the next three months. A nurse will come by soon to discharge you."" To punctuate the discussion, he thrust a vial of pain medication into the palm of my hand and instructed me to take two pills every eight to twelve hours as needed.

I nodded again, struggling to absorb the information he had spewed in my direction. Take a pill every other week for three months. A nurse will stop by in eight to twelve hours, as needed. ""Thank you, doctor."" His white coat fluttered behind him as the door snapped shut in his wake.

Alone, and with nothing to do but wait, I began absentmindedly picking at the bandage covering the IV on the back of my hand. The edges of the bandage seemed to blend in with the surrounding skin. Or maybe it just appeared that way because my vision was blurred. I ripped the bandage off and tossed it onto the small table beside the bed. Glancing down at the needle protruding from my skin, a small black rectangle appeared before me, seemingly suspended in mid-air, with a thin black line pointing toward the IV site. I squeezed my eyes shut, unsure if the rectangle was a product of the implant or just a medication induced hallucination. Upon opening my eyes, the rectangle remained unchanged except it now contained a sentence appearing in bold, white letters.

*Puncture wound, expected to heal in 3 to 5 days.*

No sooner had I finished reading the sentence than it had disappeared entirely. I focused again on the IV, squinting my eyes and straining my tired brain in an attempt to make the rectangle reappear but no amount of wiggling, grunting, or blinking brought it back. I turned instead to the vase full of pink flowers on the window sill. Taking a deep breath, I focused my eyes on the glass container, hoping to produce another blurb of information. Nothing. What was it he had said? Something about accurate inputs and fuzzy outputs, or maybe it was appropriate inputs and visual outputs. It hurt to remember.

A surly nurse burst through the doorway. The force of her entrance sent the door crashing into the adjacent wall, producing a thunderous noise that ricocheted throughout the mostly empty room. Before I could blink, she was standing at the bedside removing clamps, wires, and tubes from my chest and abdomen. For every wire she unhooked, a machine by the bedside was rendered silent, though I hadn’t noticed the beeping and whirring until it stopped.

She removed the IV from my hand. “Alright, you’re free to go.” I appreciated how blunt she was compared to Dr. Adams. She called me a taxi and, in minutes, I was out the door and headed home to recover.

Sleep came fast. Almost as soon as I'd entered my bedroom I was snoring between the sheets, but I did not dream. Hours passed, or maybe days. The blackout curtains pulled across the windows obscured any hint of sunshine and made every minute in my bedroom feel like the dead of night. Upon waking, my eyes were met with monochromatic darkness in contrast with three large, bright numbers and two letters. *8:45 am.*

The sight was startling but not unwelcome. It was a relief to know that the implant was working and capable of producing useful information, though it would certainly take some getting used to. The incision site stung and my skull throbbed in rhythm with my heartbeat. My limbs felt heavy, less so than they had at the hospital, but certainly not as limber as usual. Perhaps a cup of coffee would stave off the straggling anesthesia.

The dull thrum of pain in my skull continued as the coffee machine slowly dripped liquid into the glass pitcher below. I grabbed the oat milk from the refrigerator and noticed that the container was a little light. A thin ribbon appeared at the base of my vision, on which scrolled the details and particulars of a competitor brand of oat milk.

*Oatmax Creamy Oat Milk. Half the price and half the calories of the next leading brand, with twice the flavor. Buy now at your local retailer for 20% off. Sale price valid this week only.*

My coffee has always tasted just fine with Best Value Oat Milk and I had no intention of purchasing another brand, even if the implant suggested it. I waved my hand in front of my face, attempting to dismiss the ribbon in much the same way I would redirect smoke from the end of a strangers cigarette. It made no difference. The words continued to appear and disappear at the base of my vision. Passing in and out of my periphery over and over again.

… *your local retailer for 20% off. Sale price valid this week only. Oatmax Creamy Oat Milk. Half the price and half the calories of the next leading brand, with twice the flavor. Buy now at…*

A glitch, I thought, as I nestled into my couch. Dr. Adams had warned me that there may be a bit of an adjustment period following surgery. Still, I’d better mention this at my next appointment. It was to be a long afternoon of doing absolutely nothing but occasionally fitting a piece or two of a puzzle together. I couldn’t focus to read and the light from the television strained my sore head. I ignored, or attempted to ignore, the ribbon of text. The clock on the wall tick, tick, ticked as words disappeared and reappeared in my vision, occasionally changing from one blurb to another.

Construction workers removing sidewalk across the street rode back and forth on jackhammers throughout the afternoon. I pulled a pillow over my head and squeezed it tightly over my ears to block as much of the noise as I possibly could, which wasn't much.

*Soundly Noise Cancelling Headphones*, read the text, *Now available in six unique colors. Shop now for $149.99, online and in-store. Soundly Noise Cancelling Headphones. Now available in…*

After a shower, I noticed a slight red blemish on my forehead. No matter, I’d always been prone to the occasional outbreak, particularly when stressed.

*Simply Skin Pimple Patches. New and improved non-drying, hypoallergenic formula for reduced redness and inflammation. Fight acne with fast results. Available online or at your local drug store. Simply Skin Pimple Patches. New and improved…*

The text was accompanied by a rectangular image of a woman with porcelain smooth skin placing a small circular patch over one barely perceptible bump on her cheek. The image obscured my own face in the mirror. I reached out my hand in front of me. It passed through the face of the woman and touched only the cold surface of the mirror behind it. The image dissipated, leaving me alone with my reflection.

…*and inflammation. Fight acne with fast results. Available online or at your local drug store. Simply…*

The evening brought peace as the construction workers packed up their tools and headed home for some much deserved quiet of their own. That night, I was restless in my bed. Sleep was fleeting. Shifting and wriggling atop my mattress, I dreamt of pimples, and oat milk, and headphones, and jackhammers pounding on my skull.

The next few days passed uneventfully. The clock ticked. The pattern of the sun through the window crept across the floor. The puzzle on the coffee table was more complete now than it had been, but only barely so. Napping was easy but sleeping was hard. And always, the line of text was there, inching along and along at the bottom of my world. I tried to avoid reading the text. If I only looked up, or into the middle distance, I could almost pretend it wasn’t there at all. Again, I made a mental note to ask Dr. Adams about the glitch.

It was morning once again. 9:32 am, according to the implant. This morning marked the beginning of the fourth day spent cooped up in my apartment and I was beginning to feel every moment of it. My head no longer throbbed, though I could still feel a dull ache if I thought about it too much. Some fresh air may do me well in my healing and it would certainly be nice to stretch my legs for more than the few steps from bed to couch to kitchen. It seemed like ages since I'd spoken to or interacted with a human that wasn't some type of medical professional. The oat milk container was finally empty and resting atop a pile of microwaveable meal packages in my garbage can. I decided to visit the coffee shop around the corner and say hello to Emily. She's a pretty little thing and she always remembers my order, not that it's complicated.

Peeking out the window, I noted grey clouds floating overhead. Text appeared just beyond the window with the daily weather forecast. *Windy with a 40% chance of thunderstorms in the next hour.* Right, better get going if I want to make it to the coffee shop before the storm. I threw on a coat, the green one that compliments my eyes, or so says Emily, applied a spritz or two of cologne, and headed out the door into the windy world beyond.

The construction workers were here again today and the jackhammer sounded much louder at this close a distance. I increased my pace to escape the incessant noise and the resulting dust.

…*Now available in six unique colors. Shop now for $149.99, online and in-store. Soundly Noise Canc…*

The clouds grew ever darker, much more quickly than I had imagined they would. Thankfully, I was only a block or two away from the coffee shop. I could sit there and chat with Emily while I waited for the rain to pass. The street was busy this morning. Folks in business casual attire and raincoats walked past on their way to cars and buses. It was nice to be out and about again, feeling almost normal after so many days spent alone and in pain. A cool breeze blew across my face. Then, nothing. Just black. Completely silent and black. No passersby to watch or breeze to feel. This lasted for a moment before I saw him and only a moment more before I heard him.

A tall middle-aged man stood in the center of my vision, surrounded by multi-colored flashing lights. He was speaking loudly, almost yelling, and waving his arms around to emphasize each individual word.

COME ON DOWN TO CRAZY EDDYS ELECTRONIC EMPORIUM WHERE WE HAVE HIGH, HIGH QUALITY TELEVISIONS, CELL PHONES, AND, YES, EVEN LAPTOPS FOR THE LOW, LOW PRICE OF $599.99. THAT'S RIGHT FOLKS, $599.99.

Balloons floated up around him, each with a smiley faced emblazoned on the front. Fireworks went off in the background, exploding in showers of red and blue sparks. The tall man continued to yell.

Words appeared just below his feet. *Tax not included. No additional discounts or coupons applicable or accepted on sale priced items. 0% APR for three months with successful application for store credit card.*

He flashed a wide grin and two thumbs up in my direction before disappearing just as suddenly as he had appeared in the first place, taking the flashing lights and balloons with him. Crazy Eddy was gone and I was left disoriented and slumped over on the sidewalk, my clothes soaked from the sudden onset of a rain I hadn't seen nor heard.

“Oh my god! Are you okay? Do you need help?” yelled a nearby woman, with a sense of urgency that rivaled my own. I must look worse off than I’d thought for her to be reacting that way.

“Help...” I whispered, more to myself than anyone else, attempting to decide if I did indeed need help and what that help might even look like. At this, the implant blocked my view of the nice woman's shoes with a gray, square menu labeled “HELP.” A cold, robotic voice read the menu options aloud. Or, as aloud as was possible for a voice that likely only existed within my own mind.

“To contact 911, say ‘Emergency.’

To contact Dr. Adams, say ‘Dr. Adams’

To close this menu, say ‘Close’

To repeat these options, say ‘repeat’”

None of the options seemed particularly helpful. ""Dr. Adams,"" I selected. The nice woman and an equally nice man, who I hadn't noticed until now, were pulling me to my feet by my armpits. ""I don't know who that is, sweetie,"" said the woman, as they led me to a nearby bench one shaky step at a time.

The ringing of the phone was audible only in my conscience yet it was loud enough to obscure the voices of the people near me on the street. Their warbled words registered only in the silence between each high pitched ring as I waited for Dr. Adams to answer.

*bbrrriiinggg*

""No, no, he just collapsed on the sidewalk.""

*bbbrrriiiingg*

""I don't know, he said something about a doctor.""

*bbbrrriiiingg*

""Sir, can you tell me your name?""

*bbrrriiiiiinnnggg*

""Hello?""

The voice was solid and clear as though we were standing together in the sterile white hospital room where we had last spoken.

""Dr. Adams,"" I said, words tumbling from my lips, ""the implant. I don't know what happened. I couldn't see anything, or feel the rain, or hear anyone around me. The whole world was just this one man. He was yelling about televisions and laptops and cell phones. The implant is broken.""

""No, no, my dear lad,"" he responded. ""The implant is working precisely as intended. As a matter of fact, you must be healing splendidly for it to be working at full capacity already."" The voice was chipper. I imagined he was smiling into a telephone receiver somewhere, wherever he was.

The nice woman next to me was touching my shoulder. Her eyebrows were pulled tightly together, wrinkling her freckled forehead. Her lips were moving fast but no sound came out. She was wearing red lipstick that looked quite nice against her pale face.

""John? Can you hear me? I said the implant is working precisely as intended,"" came the clear voice inside my brain, once again. He over-enunciated his words.

""No, that can't be,"" I explained. ""It's like these... I don't know what they are. Products. Coupons. All the time. I can't make them stop.""

""Well, yes, of course. We discussed this during your consultation. Don't you remember? You selected the free trial option for your implant.""

My sodden clothes clung to my skin and sucked the warmth from my muscles. Shivering, I stood from the bench and ambled away from the crowd that had formed around me. Away from the woman with the red lipstick. Had I been heading south toward the corner store? Or north toward the coffee shop? I would like to see Emily today. She always remembered my order.

""Free trial option,"" I repeated to the street in front of me. A vague recollection floated into my subconscious. Perhaps this had been explained somewhere in the mountain of paperwork I'd signed before my procedure but I couldn't recall. The weeks leading up to the operation now seemed vague, almost translucent, in my memory. I'd hesitate to call them memories at all.

""Precisely. The advertisements will continue but your brain will compensate to—""

""Thank you, Dr. Adams. Goodbye.""

The *click* of a receiver sounded in my mind, followed immediately by the almost overwhelming cacophony of the busy street. People were talking loudly, over each other, all at once. The wheels of cars speeding by on the wet road created a constant whir. A car alarm blared in the distance. A baby was crying with a force and desperation that only the smallest lungs can manage. Rain beat a melody on metal roofs and canvas awnings. How had this discordant medley been replaced entirely by the voice of my surgeon? I'd have heard him less clearly were he standing on the street in front of me, talking against the cars, and the people, and the rain. Perhaps he was correct. The implant must be working as intended.

My wet clothes weren't bothering me so much anymore. Though I would certainly appreciate the feel of a hot beverage in my cold hands. My shuffling feet moved on towards the coffee shop where a steamed vanilla latte and a warm smile would be waiting for me. But first, I think I'll stop by Crazy Eddys Electronic Emporium.

I hear they're having a sale.

Day 1: Fly into Liberia, landing in the late morning.  Pick up rental car and then drive to Nayara Gardens near La Fortuna.  I've heard this drive can be a bit rough so we'll not dilly dally in Liberia for long but will probably want to grab a bit to eat here.

Day 2: Unstructured time at Nayara Gardens.  We will likely drive to La Fortuna and explore a bit and grab dinner.

Day 3: Zipline tour at Sky Tram/Trek

Day 4: Spa day followed by private dinner.

Day 5: Drive to Azura Beach Resort near Samara.  Would love to find some little stops along the way, maybe even a hike.  We'll want to stop for lunch somewhere too.

Day 6: Unstructured time at Azura Beach.  Sounds like you can walk down the beach to get to Samara so we will probably do that rather than drive. 

Day 7: Unstructured time at Azura Beach.

Day 8: Unstructured time at Azura Beach.

Day 9: Drive to Libera to fly out, probably grab a bite to eat either in Samara or Liberia. 

As you can see we have a lot of free time in Samara.  Definitely looking to relax and unwind at the resort but also would love to explore the area.  We're relatively young and energetic so we're down for active things.  We considered trying to find somewhere to snorkel but it sounds like snorkeling is maybe not the best in CR?  

I will be looking to buy some locally roasted coffee for our friends and family if anyone has any suggestions for that. 

Food recommendations are also very welcome.  We are adventurous eaters and have a pretty decent food budget.

I’ve had two incidents happen there.

The first one was about two years ago. I was feeling sad but wasn’t crying. A guy came up to me, complimented my looks, and asked for my Snapchat. I refused and said I don’t accept male friends. He didn’t believe me and asked me to prove I didn’t have any guys on my phone. Then he started talking about random stuff—mentioning a prince, saying his mom was a princess, and claiming he was friends with a prince. He seemed genuine because he showed me his ID and told me about his job and major. He kept trying over and over to convince me to add him, and I kept refusing.

In the end, he said, “Just try for one day. I’m not done talking yet.” I said, “Fine, just so you can finish your story, but I’ll delete you after because I’m not interested.” He agreed, and I added him. He asked why I was sad and what would make me feel better or happy. I told him something simple, but then he wanted to take me on a date, which I refused. So I deleted him. A year later, I saw him again with the prince, but they didn’t see me. I hid until they left.

The second incident happened just last week. I was extremely sad, exhausted, and at my lowest point. I looked clean but disheveled—not my hair or clothes, but just overall. My skin looked dull, and my face showed how broken I felt.

It was late at night, and the place was almost empty. Three guys came in and noticed me. They tried flirting, but I refused and got shy because I’m naturally shy with strangers, especially men. They even tried to tempt me with money, but it didn’t work. They kept trying until I got a bit upset, and they finally left.

Now, I’ve gone back to the coffee shop, and I saw them standing near the entrance. They noticed me while I was in my car, so I quickly got out and went through the back door to avoid walking past them.

I’m starting to feel uneasy now. I used to think I was invisible and that this place was my safe space, but it’s starting to feel like my nightmare. I tried looking for another spot, but I can’t find a place I love as much as this one. I don’t know what to do!",1,1736451166.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,1.0,False
1hxl1z2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hxl1z2/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,I don't know what to do,"So here's my lengthy story:

I, 19M living in the Philippines, have had a cough for almost a year now. This cough doesnt have any phlegm and that its just my throat will feel itchy, get the urge to cough and cough to clear the itch. 

At the time i got the cough i just brushed it off as a common cold. Then the cough suspiciously went on for way longer than expected. Due to school schedule and workload, the cough was only checked on 2 months later for xray and checkup. 5 months after that, only did I get ct scan and a month after that, I underwent ct guided biopsy.

Initial finding from biopsy revealed I have cancer cells in my lungs (doctors arent sure what exactly it is but required *something something history* to pinpoint what type of cancer or whatever it is and only then prescribe treatment) but my mom didn't proceed with further laboratory tests to pinpoint my condition. Yet went to another unrelated doctor that somehow is confident on what my condition is that he prescribed medicine (organic pills like Z3X, Turngreen, Turmerich to name a few, an antibacterial drink or smth, PPARS, Guyabano wine, Guyabano coffee, etc.) and it was alot, I had to follow very strict schedule for it. Do note that this doctor didnt even meet me, AND only saw basic all of my laboratory results like CBC, drug test, blood sugar count, the tests I took prior to biopsy, ALL EXCEPT FOR MY CHEST CT SCAN AND XRAY, of which were with me at the time (I was living in a dorm for university). Up to this point, he prescribed meds worth i think over 1K$ but the follow up lab test initially was only 300$. The doctor only listened to my mom's story of my condition on top of that.

I was mad at my mom for this, as to why did she have to turn around when the first doctors were at the last step in knowing my illness and eventually prescribing the next course of action whether it be surgery or just simple meds and exercise. I only got an earful for this, she praised the doctor because she learned of other patients that were healed by this doctor, and somehow ended up with her saying my 'faith to God is low'.

I dont have any medical knowledge on this topic. So I have a few questions:

1.) Isnt the 2nd doctor doing something unethical? 
**How can he prescribe these without ever meeting me, let alone talked with me. He probably had a general gist of what I have and just gave my mom a couple of meds because its 'tried and trusted' with similar TB/cancer cases. I have this extreme doubt in the second doctor because how can this doctor know what to do when even the first doctors dont even know what the illness is.

2.) Can tissue samples from a lung biopsy last for multiple months/years if kept in a good environment? 
**I haven't lost hope to the first doctors and I either save up 300$ from allowances and passive income from my side gig for a year to proceed with that one lab test behind my mom's back or wait years as I plan on finishing my college degree, get a job and get back to the test.

I am in 2nd year of university pursuing a 4yr course and I am confident in graduating and getting a decent paying job.

3.) I can try to convince my mom to proceed for the lab test. But I've done that 2 times already but here I am, thinking of my situation everyday since the day I received the biopsy initial findings. What should I do?

PS.
I dont know what exactly the first doctors said to my mom when she received the initial findings and discussed the follow up lab tests.

I am a 75 yo female who was told to shed about 25 lbs to get my BMI in a normal range. I’m am suffering from some sort of post Covid musculoskeletal issues - dizzy, stiff in morning, feel weak and exhausted. Almost like chronic fatigue which I scoff at until this started. My doc first tried Zoloft and I gained a substantial amount over my healthy 140. So we ditched that and switched to sema.  

I have never since my teens been a breakfast eater. Not hungry, feel mildly nauseated and the earlier I get up the worse it is. I first felt like this in high school. So for the balance of my life I’ve skipped breakfast. I also noticed that eating it has no impact at all on my hunger later in the day. So I always felt it was a waste of food and calories. 

I’ve never defined not eating until mid afternoon as IF because I do drink coffee with milk in it. Before the new meds after the Zoloft disaster I tried moderately low carb with lean proteins and dabbled with keto. But it was sorta wrecked by the 2 or 3 oz of milk in my coffee. And it was expensive and depressing to watch my family devour potatoes and rice and bread and made me grumpy and sulky. 

With Sema I am absolutely never hungry at 8 pm like I used be - that was my binge time. I can easily now (and always could postpone lunch until two pm but then eat dinner and be hungry twenty minutes later) skip breakfast and lunch and basically do OMAD with coffee. My only real exercise due to this post covid vertigo is careful walking on flat surfaces. I am terrified of falling and quit hiking and biking which I was able to do prior to getting COVID. 

I know this is lengthy. I am just wondering if I should make something, anything “go down” other than water. This isn’t true IF by definition. When I was pre covid I ate a pretty much paleo template with the including a small amounts of milk. I use ghee for cooking or avo oil. I do not eat any gluten grains, bread, legumes (except green beans) added sugars or fake sugars. I did a whole 30 and felt amazing. Added back gluten and felt like crap. Stopped eating gluten, corn and quinoa and felt better again and lastly added a bit of cream to coffee, then later switched to Fairlife milk. And that’s how I eat now, just cut out the crap that slipped in like chips and ice cream. 

Has anyone gone down this route? It is easy to understand weight gain through over consumption of ultra processed garbage, but not good healthy organic fruits and veg with lean proteins. I am curious. ",0,1736451107.0,OzempicForWeightLoss,0,0.5,False

I grew up in OC very near ""Little Saigon"", was constantly around/interacting with Vietnamese people so I became curious about the language and started learning it at age 17. I'm 52 now so I've been able to speak it for most of my life. 

I moved up here to SLO 12 years ago closer to my dad and siblings, and went from being able to speak the language on a daily basis, to not being able to use it at all - SLO is essentially a linguistic desert for that language - and as a result my linguistic skills began to atrophy.

I joined TikTok and a couple other apps and have friends in Vietnam that I communicate with often, but it's just not the same as being able to converse with people in person, which I miss very much. 

I thought about starting a group on Meetup, but apparently it costs to start a group on there and people have to pay to join it so I'm not willing to go that route. 

Basically what I'm looking for is either people who are fluent in the language - or possibly, people who are learning the language  - to maybe get together with for conversation and coffee, a drink, etc from time to time.

This morning, he bit me during another argument and then locked me in the bathroom, laughing at my distress.

1hxksvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hxksvf/miss_me/,Miss Me ?,"Sitting in front of the beach, carelessly sipping my beer, enjoying the sunset, what a blissful time to be alive. I was in some next level of trance, everything seemed so surreal, so tranquilizing. 

The amber colored sun like a big fireball slowly getting swallowed by the vastness of the sea. The sound of waves like some melodious music, the occasional chirping of the birds adding to the effect. The rising waves were touching my legs at a regular interval like some natural therapy.

I was bothered about the fact that why none of my problems were bothering me, how come life was so peaceful suddenly, I did not have any idea how I reached this place which is amazingly beautiful. I was practicing mindfulness at its best, completely living in the present, no thoughts of past or present.

Then I saw her outline darkened by the sunrays coming from the opposite side but her body, her hair, her hands, everything about her was so deeply engraved in my mind that I could recollect her from anywhere.


""She can’t be here, she is miles away from me, in a different city, happy with her husband"", I told myself. 

""This person is someone else, my mind is hallucinating, my mind justifying the position of being my greatest enemy is playing trick on me.  My mind who can’t stand me being happy even for some minutes, my jealous wicked evil mind who after failing to bring any regrets of past or any worries of future bringing the image of many of my sorrow in front of me to win this contest."", I started cursing my mind mentally.

The figure started coming close, she was wearing the same shiny red dress she wore in the college farewell party. Crazy coincidence, after all that happened between us, the drama and the bitter parting away, no conversations not even the formal birthday wishes exchanged from last 10 years and yet I found her slowly approaching me in the same dress she looked the most spectacular once.

A part of me who craved her so much was becoming heavy again, I forcefully brought all the negative thoughts back in mind to end this mental coup.

Life has changed so much since we last talked. From my menial job which was too small for us and from my unknown college, I got into a high paying job after doing my MBA from a fancy college. She got married in between, she didn’t invite me and I was glad I was not asked to come because had I gone there, either I would have surely created some drama to vent out my frustration or I would have gotten lost between the thoughts of self-pity and why life is so unfair to me.

 We were still friends on social media though, that is how I got to know about her marriage, I rarely talked to our common friends, I didn’t want even a shade of her involvement in my new life. A life I created for myself, where I am successful, powerful and happy at least superficially and not the helpless me which she made me once. She was not very active on social media ever and after her marriage, she didn’t post anything. I didn’t care, though once in a while I did use to go to her profile to check if there is anything new.

But I sensed her presence that day. As they say, the world is a small place. That day was 31st December and I was enjoying my vacations in Thailand, a popular tourist spot, many Indians go there these days. As they say, the ambitious middle class of India has shifted from Goa to Thailand. I thought maybe she had come here with her husband. A coincidence, a painful one.

I didn’t know if there is any antonym of serendipity, but if there is one, I was going through it. Her outline was becoming clearer and clearer with every passing second. This was definitely her, I was convinced now. For countless time during my college, I had wondered at her physical beauty. The way her hair moved with a passing breeze amplifying her beauty so much that she looked almost like an angel who had come from some other world. How can anyone born on this planet be so beautiful?

As I was getting deeper and deeper into the thoughts with my past and present getting one again without any visible boundaries and I was losing sense and the memory of what all happened in the last 10 years, there was a sudden halt. I was suddenly brought back in the present. Do you remember when you are having a very clear dream and then someone wakes you and you get back to your senses pretty quickly while still retaining the thoughts of your dream. I suddenly remembered that it was 31st December 2019, I was in Thailand and she was not here.

Was I hallucinating? But it felt so real.

I have always wondered whenever I read the stories of people going through schizophrenia and other mental condition, how it feels to imagine a person. I guess I experienced it that day. Subconscious mind is indeed a complicated yet magical thing, it can bring back someone in front of your eyes, someone of whom you rarely think about these days. I threw the remaining beer into trash, may be the nature vibes with the alcohol had made me lose touch with reality for a while.

Next 3 days were horrible, I was haunted by her thoughts again and again. As if I had never moved on, as if I never accepted my fate. I went through series of mental state. From self-pity to cursing her for my misery, from laughing at her new mediocre life to imagining the ‘what if…’ . I came back to Hyderabad on 4th January and I felt relieved immediately. 

Although I hated my job and the fact that I put in 14-16 hours a day. I knew my job will be my savior now. I would get busy juggling stuff, firefighting and bitching about the toxic work culture of my company. I would forget her soon. It happened exactly the way I thought. The villains of my present took the place of her thoughts and I forgot about her completely.

I woke up with a very dried throat, cold sweat coming from side of my head and a mind spinning furiously. I had a terrible nightmare. I have had nightmares before. But none of them felt so real, and none of them had such lasting memory after waking up and none of them made me almost shit my pants while replaying them in my mind. I was back to the same beach, same setting and the same scene. She was coming near me. I was having the same chain of thoughts like that day and a strong déjà vu. Like I was not sure whether this is real or not and if it is real, it felt like it is happening again. But this time she didn’t vanish, she keep on coming close to me. She came almost at a 1 feet distance to me and then she asked:

“Miss me?”

I was startled by the question. It’s been 10 years, why did she want to have a confirmation on whether I still think about her or not. I made my mind that I will say very rudely that I neither miss her nor do I feel anything about her. She didn’t exist in my mental landscape anymore. I made an eye contact. Her facial features were slowly changing. They were becoming very aggressive. The eyes were getting bigger, some lines coming at temple, she stood so tall and her stance was so aggressive as if she was ready to attack me. Her face was slowly turning red, violent red, as if reflecting some deep buried anger.

Do you remember the scene from the movie Bhool Bhulaiya where Vidya Balan argues with Akshay Kumar near a temple and Akshay notices her change of expression, I felt the same. Her pupil became enlarged and now all I can see was pitch black color. I was transfixed, I could’t move, she was looking directly into my eyes and I couldn’t run. I couldn’t do anything. I was trembling. She put a hand on my shoulder, I had never felt an icy touch like that, then she came 2 inches away from my face, looked directly into my eyes, I was able to see my frighten face in the reflection of those dark voids and then she asked again in a very disturbing high pitch echoed voice.

“Miss me”?

I woke up after this. The clock pronounced 3:03 AM, the hour of the devil as they say. It took me a while to become normal again. My heart was racing like an engine, my breaths were heavy, uneven and very fast. The sweating never stopped. I went to kitchen and had some water. During the whole journey from my bedroom to kitchen, I felt like I was being watched, someone was there, lurking in the dark corners of my house. It is said that whenever we feel we are being watched, we are being watched, as evolution developed our senses to work effectively, especially in darkness to save us from any predator attack. I was not sure whether my senses are working overtime or my miserable life has finally broken my mental sanity and I was hallucinating a lot.

I discussed the dream next day with my best friend. As expected, he laughed it off. He teased me saying that even after all these years, I was not able to move on from her. I searched for the meaning of the dream in google also. All I got was some random shit about unfulfilled needs and desires, blocked expectations and stress. In short, no solution at all. A part of me wanted to visit a counsellor or psychotherapist for some professional help. But then I thought maybe I was overthinking it. There was one random hallucination and then a random dream, may be the former was the cause of the later, just a random emotional phase. I should not give much heed to this. I felt loneliness was getting to me now and I should think about getting married. For the first time in my life, I felt lonely and sad about me being lonely. For the first time in life, I craved for some companionship.

Next few days went normally. I usually sleep the entire noon on Sundays. My life has made me an introvert lately. I have stopped going out with people. I just don’t like being with others or maybe I interact so much with people during my work week, it’s better to stay alone on Sunday. I ordered a heavy brunch and then watched a movie and fell asleep. I woke up when it was late, it had become quite dark. There was no light turn on in the house and no light coming from outside also. Usually my room is decently illuminated by the lights coming from outside. Perhaps a power cut I thought. It took sometimes for my eyes to get adjusted in the darkness and get some vision. Suddenly my mouth went dry and I got goosebumps all over my body as if electricity is flowing through my veins. In the dimly lit corner where some blue light was struggling for its existence. She was standing, in the same red dress and with the same dark black eyes watching me intently and angrily as if she was trying to pierce my whole body through her gaze.

Miss Me?

She asked again. My paralysis returned. It was real, it was happening, it was the reality, it was no dream. She started walking towards me while maintaining the eye contact. She kept on asking “miss me” in a tone that was frightening. She came very close. I saw her illuminated by that blue light in the room.

 Her dress was tattered, her face was rough, dry and splitting from many places developing cracks like dry clay. Her hairs were very dry and scattered everywhere. She had come to punish me. Punish me for no faults of mine, it was her decision to reject me, it was her decision to move on from me, it was her decision to kick me out of her life. What was she punishing me for?

“What do you want from me?” I screamed with all my might.

She touched her head with my head as we used to do during college. Then she smiled. It was a very creepy smile and then I had no memory. I opened my eyes and I was on my bed. I checked my phone, it was 9 PM. The room was well illuminated as always. I slept for like good 7 hours. My whole body felt tired. Was it a dream again? It couldn’t be. It felt so real this time. I was pretty sure it happened but then I thought maybe my mind was playing games with me again? I was very confused. Should I discuss this with my mother, but then she will get unnecessarily worried. I thought of talking to her directly. That seemed to be the best solution. Thousands of thoughts were running parallelly in my mind.

“Just drop a hi, do a casual chat, nothing serious. This will calm my mind. Her ice cold single word replies will convince my brain that she is alive and still the same. It will move on. These thoughts will go away.”

I didn’t have her phone number. We didn’t have any common whatsapp groups also. So the only place of communicating was Facebook, the medium where our love story started, it felt like a poetic justice that I was to reach out to her on facebook for a much needed closure. It is true I hated her for a while. Who wouldn’t? After all those tall claims of how much she wanted me and needed me in her life, after those flirting, after spending so much time together, after expressing our feelings for each other, after so much future planning, being kicked out unceremoniously like that.

I had hard feelings for a long time but then I moved on. I had bigger and better villains in my life to give me a hard time and I forgot about her. She became a blurry image in my head till that unfortunate day of 31st December 2019. I opened my facebook and surprisingly she was online. Generally she keeps her messenger offline. I opened the window. I thought on what I would write. I never used to write ‘HI’ to her before, so it would be really awkward to write it now. Suddenly the window flashed that she is typing. Again, too much coincidences for a day.

“What she has to say to me?” My mind created 100s of scenario.

“But at least, she is here, she is real, she is alive, there will be a normal conversation and this ordeal will end. May be I will share the dream with her and we can have a good laugh on that, like old days. We can have normal conversations, we don’t despite each other anymore.”

It seemed like she was typing a really long paragraph, no message came even after 5 minutes yet it kept on displaying the typing message. I became frustrated after a while. May be it’s a technical glitch, they used to happen a lot during early 2010 but haven’t seen anything like that lately. I visited her profile. She had last put a post 5 years back. She was not tagged in any photo for last 3 years. I kept on browsing her older post and saw a message she had shared. I knew that post was about me when she had put it. It was a subtle jibe, aimed at me, where she portrayed me as a villain, as a sadist, as a jealous and immature person who ruined our relation. My mind filled with a rage. I closed my laptop. I didn’t care what she was typing or what she wanted to say. I even forgot my own purpose of talking to her. I felt intense anger. I punched the wall with all my mind and felt the sharp pain on my knuckles. Self-destruction is not always rewarding.

It felt like the real her was as evil as that hallucinating haunting version of her. After all she did to me, she still considered me as the villain. I who suffered daily because of her and now I was the oppressor and she was the victim. It took me a while to calm down. I took some deep breathes. I opened my Jack Daniels, and gulped it down neat like they show in the movies. It burnt my throat, but I felt better after a while. I made a civilized peg after that, then one more peg and then again. I played some old melancholy music. I didn’t know when I passed out into deep sleep fully drunk and out of senses. When I woke up, my laptop was on and a song was being played. It was her favorite song. Youtube was also playing games now I thought. I reached the laptop to shut it, I saw the screen, facebook was still open, and her chat window was also open with 2 words written after our last chat there 10 years back.

“Miss me?”

I had reached a stage beyond fear now. Partly because I was not sure whether it was a dream or it was another of hallucination and party I was curious now what is happening. I replied this time with a rude block lettered NO. As soon I entered the text, I received a video call from her. I turned it on. I saw not her pretty face but the same disfigured haunted face. She tilted her neck, took a breath and then she said something that made shook me so much that I dropped my laptop from my hand.

She said, “I will make sure, you will miss me”!

It was 3 Am in the night. I was so scared, I just left my home. I went to a nearby 24*7 café just because I wanted to be surrounded by people. Whether I should visit a psychiatrist or a priest I was not sure now. I needed to talk to people about this. I stayed away even from my mobile because I was scared she will contact me from there. I had 4 coffees in the café and I stayed there till 6 AM. I put my usual “not feeling well, can’t come to office” message to my boss. I started scrolling my contact list to find the best person to talk to. My fingers stopped at the name of a common friend. She might still be in touch with her. I had no idea what to say to her also. She also used to be a good friend but we hadn’t talked for last 4 years except exchanging likes on social media posts. Should I discuss the events with her? Should I ask her to do a conference call to resolve everything? I had no idea what I will achieve from this call, but I felt a great instinct to call her.

I checked my facebook on my mobile. There were no conversations of last night. It just displayed our old messages years ago. A part of me was expecting this.

I called the common friend immediately knowing she would be asleep at this time. She was not a morning person. She responded after a long time still very deep in the sleep. I hadn’t even thought of a good excuse by that time on why I was calling her so early. But she sensed the trembling of my voice and asked me what is wrong. She was always a sweet heart when it comes to helping people. I explained to her what I was going through in a single breadth. There was a long pause afterwards, I thought the phone is disconnected.

She said my name in such a grave tone that it shook me. She then asked me the date of my first such bizarre experience. I told her that it was 31st Dec 2019. She paused again but I could hear her breathing. She told me that my ex-girlfriend died on the same day in a car accident. The moment she uttered those word, I got a FB messenger notification from her account with the same 2 dreaded words.

About 2 years ago I (27M) matched with a girl on bumble, let’s call her Ruby (27F). We decided to grab coffee at a local spot, which is always my preferred first date to feel out the vibes. She was reserved at first but opened up more as the date went on. We had good conversation and she was really nice so we parted ways with setting up a second date. No kiss or any physical contact for that matter. Our second date was at Top Golf and went pretty similar to the first; we connected and had good conversation. And while there weren’t crazy sparks, I figured it could be worth seeing where things go. 

Fast forward another two dates and it became more clear to me that even though Ruby was super nice, the romantic connection just wasnt there for me. Mind you, I still hadn’t tried to make a move and since we were 4 dates in, I figured she was wondering where we stood. So i decided to give her a call to talk about us. 

Forgive me as this is where my memory gets slightly fuzzy with exactly what words were used. In an effort to let her down easy (probably a mistake), I essentially said at this moment I’m not really ready for anything and that I’m focusing on bettering myself right now. This wasn’t a lie at all, but maybe not the best way of approaching it. She took it surprisingly really well (almost as if she didn’t realize this was me kinda breaking it off). And we somehow ended the conversation with “still down to hangout if you want”. We haven’t discussed “us” since this conversation. 

So over the course of the next year, we kept in contact on a somewhatish regular basis and hungout maybe once a month on average. Hanging out always consisted of just the two of us, which isn’t really unusual for me. I have a few friendships that are like that, including 100% platonic female friends. But none of those other friendships started from a dating app or the intention of pursuing each other romantically. 

Let me be clear, even though we hung out several times one on one and even in date-y like settings (watching a movie, farmers market, dinner, mini golf, etc), we have never slept together, kissed, nor had any romantic physical contact. We probably hugged goodbye a few times. So it was clear to me that we are just friends. But in the back of my head, there’s still that lingering thought that she thinks we are more. She’s pretty religious so it’s possible the lack of physical intimacy is common in what she expects from a relationship. I tried to distance myself a bit, limiting texting to every couple weeks or so, thinking that things might drift apart naturally. I know this isn’t a perfect way of handling it, but it was easiest to go about it that way at the time. 

Fast forward to the last 9ish months. I’ve made a dramatic lifestyle change and am now living in different states rather than my home state for about 70% of the year. So naturally, the hanging out has slowed down since I’m not around as much. Same with my other friendships too. 

I recently met a girl, let’s call her Julie (25F), and things are starting to progress towards what looks like will be an actual relationship with me and Julie. I just got back to my hometown last week and Ruby wanted to hangout, specifically wanting to see a movie and grab dinner. She also said she got me a Christmas gift and wants to give it to me. I understand this might sound ridiculous to assume she views our friendship as a romantic relationship, but it’s the lack of closure and ambiguity (totally my fault) that leaves me feeling uncomfortable with it all. If I develop a serious relationship with Julie, I want her to feel secure knowing that I have no romantic feelings for Ruby and that Ruby (hopefully) feels the same. 

As an additional wrinkle, Ruby just got laid off from her job and had a close family member pass away, so I don’t want to pile on by causing distress in the friendship just because I might be delusionally thinking that she perceives it as a relationship.

So here’s where my dilemma stands. I am planning on hanging out with Ruby in a couple days. I want to eliminate any ambiguity that remains. Yes, I totally recognize that any ambiguity that exists is because I should have had a more direct conversation with her long ago. 1) What do you think Ruby’s perception of the relationship is? 2a) Do I need to have a direct conversation with her and risk making things super awkward because it was ‘obvious’ that we are just friends? 2b) If so, what is the best approach that would have the lowest amount of potential harm to her feelings? 3) Is it better to casually mention in conversation that I met Julie and am developing a relationship with her, to give her the hint?",1,1736450492.0,relationship_advice,6,0.67,False

Hi, this is my first time posting here and I’m in desperate need of advice.

I am a woman, 25, and I was under medication of isotretinoin for 2 years. This medication is VERY risky that if get pregnant, there is a high chance that the baby will be defective physically and internally.

Unfortunately, I got pregnant.

I know it’s my fault for not having double contraceptives. I only used oral contraceptive pills. I researched thoroughly about isotretinoin babies and I can’t risk it. That’s when me and my partner decided to terminate the baby.

Abortion is illegal here in my country so I search groups and people through Facebook that offers abortion pills. After how many sellers, posts, testimonials, I landed to a seller who I believe is legit.

She joined me in a group where her clients share their testimonies about success. I was so drawn and desperate so I ordered mine after a few days of observing.

Im 5 weeks pregnant at this point but I bought a higher dosage so it’s more effective. It costed me 6,100 pesos ($104). After a few days, the package came discreetly.

Here are the instructions the seller gave me:

☀️ (PREPARATION) ☀️
5 days of home remedies + 2 days of fasting

(If you don’t follow, you know the consequences!)

————-

Mind you, I followed all of this. I’m almost dying from dieting and making myself hungry, and it was holiday season this time 🥲 I took the risk instead repeating the whole process anyway. After 1 week of basically suic*d*ng, today is now the time to take the pills.

Here’s the procedure she gave me:

12am 10 evening primrose simultaneously
2 am insert misoprostol to vagina
3 am drink misoprostol directly with water
3:15 drink 5 mifepristone with water
3:20 drink 5 mifepristone with water

elevate your legs for 7 hours. you are allowed to stand up at 9am
no vomiting, no peeing, no pooping

————

Of course, I followed the procedure. It was intense. I felt the every pain unbearably. And unfortunately, after 7 hours of procedure, from the clots that I sent her, there’s no fetus, no embryo. I waited for a while, hoping I could still push more clots and the fetus. I followed her instructions (exercise, steam, spicy soup, ginger tea). After few hours, bleeding went down. In short, even if I bought a higher dosage, followed the instructions, basically d!ed for a week, the 1st attempt was unsuccessful.

You don’t even want to imagine how frustrated and hopeless I am. I cried my heart out because I am so exhausted and hungry. For a week, I k*ll*ed myself by eating only skyflakes while watching the people around me eat foods they cooked for Christmas and New Year.

The seller said that my baby has a strong grip and the chances of the abortion now is 50/50. I asked her if I can try again and she said yes. And again, my dear friends, fruits, and vegetables, for the second time around, I ordered the medicines which costed me another $104 💔

After 2 days of resting, she told me that she already sent out the medicines. That’s where I started the one hell week of preparations. Exercise, ginger tea, steaming, dieting, fasting, etc. Damn, I was like in su*c*dal mode for a whole month.

This point, I’m already on my 8th week pregnancy. Fast forward, the medicines came, I fasted, di*ed again for 2 days because hell, I was hungry as fuck, and did the procedure weakly, feeling dehydrated, but desperately want to overcome this.

AND WHEN I TELL YOU, this second time around WAS FUCKING CRAZY. I’m all prepared—diapers, napkins, medicines, whatever the shit that i need is all beside me. I thought I can pass this through since I already experienced it but GODDAMN it was more intense.

When the medicines kicked in, the chills are worst to the point where I was in my PJs, sweater, socks, and comforter. My temp rose to 39* and after 3.5 hours, I can’t bear the diarrhea anymore. The instructions says I SHOULD NEVER stand up regardless of feeling to pee or poop but holy mother of all the saints, IT WAS UNBEARABLE. I was praying and begging and begging but it was really out of my control.

That’s where I decided to “FUCK THIS” and ran in the bathroom. I shitted my heart out. After a few hours, heavy bleeding came and there were clots but no sign of fetus and embryo still 💔

This is the part where I go numb. The seller advised me again to exercise and push, but I can feel it’s again unsuccessful…

You know, I’m at this point where I question the Lord if He still loves me because why isn’t He on my side where I needed Him the most 😭 I wanted to cry but no more tears to cry. I’m all stuck up looking at the ceiling of my little room. I’m feeling so hopeless. 

Now, I searched WoW and WHW and wanted to try another dose but I’m afraid it might be unsuccessful for me again. The other option is for me to go to the doctor and tell them i miscarried but im afraid they might find out about the abortion and tell the authorities about it.

Here's what I've gone thru (digestive issues, wound issues)","Hey y'all, thought I'd share my experience so far w/o the fake pregnancy screwing me up. I'll list my circumstances and then my experience.

* Total abdominal hysterectomy removing cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes. Horizontal incision.
* I'm at the age where perimenopause becomes a part of life.
* I've never been pregnant (AFAIK).
* I'm on the heavier side, and have been using tirzepatide regularly.
* My TAH was done to treat complications related to having an enlarged uterus and subserosal fibroids all over the place, I couldn't stop bleeding and the comorbidities were out of control. The mass removed was pretty big.

And the highlights so far:

* I was in the hospital for two nights.
* I'm not very mobile due to joint issues, so I've been trying to move around as much as I can but it's a little difficult.
* Before I left the hospital, all bleeding ended, and I could urinate and break wind.
* First BM completed four days post-op.
* Went back on tirzepatide a week following the surgery; I was off it for three weeks.
* I'm tired a lot, a little moody, and hunger fluctuates more than it did beforehand.
* Started to get regular again, so I put down my guard. That was a bad idea. 2 1/2 weeks PO I was blocked up and had terrible gas pains radiating up to my chest. It was bad enough that I had DoorDash deliver some Fleet brand products and I used one. Because of this subreddit and all of your posts, I came to the conclusion that it was 'just' constipation and wasn't serious, just unbelievably uncomfortable. And I kept belching which often led to vomiting. Also called doc on call and she said it's probably just constipation. I woke up the next day feeling just fine. I think the ""dreaded apparatus"" (Seinfeld reference) was what led me to turn the corner.
* Currently trying to get 30 g fiber per day into my system. Using Colace twice a day, and have a Milk of Magnesia shot before bed. I get the fiber from veggies, seeds, and from soluble fiber that I add to my morning protein shake/coffee drink I always have. I'm very vigilant about this because the Fleet Night is something I never want to have again.
* Incontinence issues are gone.
* The incision scar is healing but not quickly enough, so I have to get it debrided next week.

My takeaways: First of all, after getting a huge mass removed from your lower abdomen, the organs around it need to settle. That takes awhile, as in weeks. I learned that while my intestines settle into their new locations, digestive behavior will be all over the map. I also saw that several people in this subreddit had a similar incident to the painful one I described above, at about the same time in their recovery. It'd be interesting to find out if the volume of the organs removed during the hysterectomy is correlated to the length of time it takes to get through the digestive issues. Oh! And I can't stop burping! This is another thing mentioned in this subreddit. My surgeon clearly laid out what issues I should go to the ER for PO, and none of these items qualify.

Thanks to the posters in this group, I was able to navigate through these issues. So keep posting! It really helps.",8,1736449989.0,hysterectomy,1,1.0,False

It’s an entirely different beast compared to the whirlwind romances of your 20s. By now, you’ve probably figured out who you are at your core, are well into your career, and have cool hobbies you care about. All of this self-actualization is empowering and fulfilling, but it doesn’t come without sacrifice.

Your 30s are a time of responsibility. You have a house or rent payment to make, you have other bills to pay, and you have to ensure you leave time at the end of each day for yourself. Dating isn’t carefree anymore because the stakes are higher. You have less free time to invest in your love life, more deal-breakers and non-negotiables for a partner, a smaller dating pool, and a nagging sense of urgency about finding love.

I spent my 30s building LUMA with no finance backing and navigating a serious relationship, so trust me when I say I understand how tumultuous dating in your 30s is. But all the challenges aside, dating after 30 can be rewarding if you play your cards right.

To give you a hint, your mindset, discipline, and societal pressures are probably doing a number on your dating game.

 

**Balancing Career and Personal Life**

For most of us, our 30s are the decade of responsibility. By 30, you’re in the thick of building your career, whether that’s climbing the corporate ladder or running your own business. It’s exciting and deeply fulfilling to be at the peak of your career, but I know from personal experience that it’s also one of the most stressful, chaotic times of life.

Before I became a [Matchmaker](https://lumasearch.com/matchmaker/), I worked in corporate finance and process improvement, one of the most demanding industries in the world! Between late nights spent glaring at the blue light of my laptop, attending every networking event possible and being asked to do a “quick” weekend project twice a month, my personal and romantic life inevitably took a hit. There were entire months in my 30s when I didn’t have time to catch up with friends and family, let alone actively date!

So, what is a still-young, striving professional supposed to do: sacrifice their career, or sacrifice their love life? The best answer doesn’t actually require any immolation. You can maintain your career standing and have time to date, but you must set boundaries around your schedule.

 

**Pressure to Settle Down**

Anyone still single in their 30s can probably relate to this. Whether you’re a [man](https://lumasearch.com/matchmaker-men/), [woman](https://lumasearch.com/matchmaker-women/), or any gender in between, I bet you feel the intense pressure to find a partner, settle down, and start having babies. Trust me, you won’t find a bigger spokesperson for love, marriage, and family than me, but society’s expectations around these major, life-changing milestones is honestly doing more harm than good.

Your family means well, but I know that hearing, “so, when are you going to find a nice man/lady and give me grandbabies?” is more of a gut-punch than real motivation. Plus, receiving invitation after invitation for yet another wedding can make you feel like an outsider. All of these well-meaning, but poorly executed pressures only adds more stress and anxiety around dating, and at worst, make you settle for a partner who isn’t truly aligned with your values and lifestyle.

Here’s the thing no one talks about, though: the pressure to get married and have kids isn’t just an external one. I’ve had tons of clients fixate on their “biological clock” and worry they’ll run out of time to have children. I promise you that this mindset is not going to help you achieve your relationship and family goals. It’s more likely to ensure that you scare off all your dates instead of finding a lasting partnership!

 

**Smaller Dating Pool**

You know all those wedding invitations I mentioned? Not only is that creating more pressure to settle down, it’s also a harbinger of the shrinking dating pool. By your 30s, you’re probably seeing that most of your friends are already married or in long-term relationships. I’m sorry to say that it’s not all in your head; the dating pool really is getting smaller.

If you have healthy standards and boundaries, finding a great life partner just got a lot more difficult, especially if you’re in a rural area. I grew up in a small Midwestern town, but settled in Minneapolis for my career. Every single one of my friends back home chose to either relocate for love or marry someone from our small town they barely liked. It’s not that all the “good” ones are taken, because what you consider a good partner is entirely subjective. But, there are less singles on the market, making it trickier to find someone who shares your goals, values, and interests.

If you’re in a larger city, dating after 30 is slightly easier, simply because there’s a bigger population. Still yet, most of us have established friend groups and daily routines by 30, making it harder to meet new people. We’re creatures of comfort and habit, so why would anyone drive an extra 10 miles to try out a new bar or coffee shop when they know the one in their neighborhood has good brews? Finding potential partners after 30 becomes more of a task, and it requires breaking your routine and experimenting.

 

**Everyone Has Baggage**

I personally hate the word “baggage”. It’s outdated and even derogatory, yet, its negative connotation says a lot about how we view people. It’s said that no one’s a clean slate after 25, and I’d have to agree with that. The truth is that by your 30s, you’ve lived through formative life experiences: a traumatic breakup, death of a loved one, or losing your career. Collectively, we coin these experiences as “baggage”, but it’s not really fair to compare the weight that one carries to the burden of another.

Life’s traumas can be the most profound drivers of growth, self-expansion, and self-actualization, but they can also emotionally stunting and change us negatively. Truly, you either grow through it or become a worse version of yourself. The real issue is that some people will write you off before knowing which path you selected.

Being divorced before 30 can either mean that you learned from your mistakes and are going to make an amazing partner the second time around, or that you’re immature and not ready for commitment. Unfortunately, some people won’t give you the time of day to find out, but you weren’t meant for them anyway. You have to find a partner who’s empathetic, patient, and understanding, and that narrows down the dating pool even further.

 

**Dating With Young Children**

I really don’t want to frame this as if children are a burden, but I think we can all recognize that trying to find time to go on dates while still raising kids is a particularly delicate challenge. Even if your ex-partner stepped up and is an amazing co-parent, trying to juggle your career, your kids’ schedules, keeping the house clean, and everything else life demands can take up most of your time.

Don’t even get me *started* on the costs of childcare. Seriously, when a reputable babysitter is over $100 for one evening, it makes sense why so many singles parents avoid dating in their 30s. A fear years back, I had a client who waited an entire decade after her divorce to start dating again, even though she was emotionally ready long before she re-entered the dating scene. Her biggest hang-up? You guessed it: childcare.

There’s really no good solution to affordable, trustworthy childcare right now unless you have family who love children, but waiting years and years to re-enter the dating scene because of it isn’t fair to you! As a parent, of course your children should come first. That said, you are deserving of love *right now*, not just when it’s easier to find. If childcare is your biggest obstacle to finding a new relationship, there are workarounds like leveraging your friends and family, finding new childcare options a bit further away, and planning dates well in advance.

 

**How to Start Dating in Your 30s**

No one said that dating after 30 would be easy. What I can promise you is that learning the right way to date in your 30s is going to completely change your experience. So many of my past 30-something clients went about dating from the wrong mindset, and eventually got so burnt out of dating that they outsourced it to me. So much of what holds us back are the limitations we set for ourselves, and that applies to finding love, too. I’ll show you want preconceptions are preventing you from finding a partner, and unique methods to dating after 30!

 

**Practice Mindful Dating**

Every now and then, the kids give us a page to take from their book. As part of the “dating revolution” of the youth, singles in their late teens and 20s are becoming more intentional about who they date, and you should, too! In your 30s, dating with intention can save you from wasted time and more heartache. Simply put, mindful dating is focusing on compatibility instead of lust and attraction. It’s less about playing a numbers game or casting a wide net and more about going out with singles who align with your lifestyle. If you only apply one of these tips for dating after 30, be sure to make it this one!

 

**Invest in Yourself First**

I know this almost sounds like a cliche, but it’s especially true for learning how to date in your 30s. Before you start looking for a partner, really consider if you’re the best version of yourself. People don’t date based on potential; however you are right now will determine the caliber of partner you attract. If you’re emotionally immature, you’ll end up with someone with the same issues unless you better yourself. So take a self inventory of how you’re doing physically, emotionally, and mentally, and create a plan to level-up any areas you’re not confident in.

 

**Reconsider Your Deal-Breakers**

With the current dating trends and topics, I know this tip isn’t going to sit well with some people, but hear me out: finding a partner isn’t like buying a house. Although a list of deal-breakers and non-negotiables is important to have, you have to be flexible. You can have a rigid checklist for buying a house, but not for a real human being who’s as flawed as the rest of us. When your deal-breakers are too strict or picky, you’re losing opportunities for genuine connection. Ask yourself which traits are truly going to make you happy in the long run, and which ones are limiting your options.

 

**Leverage Your Past and Learn From It**

Like I mentioned, you can either see your past experiences as “baggage” or as opportunities for growth. If you want to attract the best possible partner, you have to do the hard thing: take your painful experiences, process them, and learn something from them. When it comes to your past relationships, write down what went right and what went wrong, and leverage this knowledge in your dating life. Make your past a catalyst to break out of self-defeating patterns and become a healthier, happier version of yourself. I promise that if you practice self-expansion, higher-quality singles will gravitate towards you.

 

**Use Niche Dating Platforms, If Any**

If you’ve read any of my other blogs, you’ve seen the science behind the negative affects of dating apps. I’m not going to rehash that here, so if you still choose to use online dating platforms, you need to think small. I know Famer’s Only is widely ridiculed, but there are more modern options! There are niche dating apps that are solely for [Christians](https://lumasearch.com/christian-matchmaker/), [Muslims](https://lumasearch.com/muslim-matchmaker/), outdoor enthusiasts, and every other affiliation or hobby you can think of. This way, you already have one thing in common with every match. If you try it out and start feel burnt out or fatigued, please consider ditching dating apps altogether for your mental health.

 

**Embrace Romantic Travel**

I wonder how many romance novels have been written about a woman who’s swept off her feet by some handsome local she met on vacation. However, that’s not exactly what I’m referring to when I say “romantic travel”. Our routines can get in the way of finding love, so it’s time for a change in scenery. If your not finding compatible singles in your community, try visiting a new city for singles events or speed dating. Even something like try a new coffee shop across town will allow you to meet new people! Expanding your horizons and being willing to travel for love will drastically open your dating pool.

 

**Date Outside Your “Type”**

This ties in with my point of reconsidering your deal-breakers, but it’s to the opposite affect. As important as it is to shorten your list of deal-breakers, you should also increase the qualifications for what makes someone “your type”. For example, I once had a client who refused to date anyone who didn’t have blue eyes. This is a ridiculous standard that’s only holding you back from real connection. Dating after 30 means prioritizing compatibility over surface-level traits. Try focusing more on how your date makes you feel, how often they make you laugh, and how they align with your long-term goals.

 

**Reconnect With Old Friends**

I’ll be the first one to tell you not to use friendships solely for romantic connections, but this is a rare win-win: you get to revisit an old friendship and potentially find a great partner. Seriously, a friend of your friend is also your friend (and maybe more). Remember that friend you had in college that you secretly had a crush on? Reach out to them! Even if they aren’t single, they might know someone who is. Do you have a friend you were super close with, but somehow drifted apart from? Send them a message, invite them to grab a beer, and catch up. After a month or so of rekindling the friendship, ask them if they know anyone else who’s single.

 

**Go For Personality, Not Looks**

This one should go without saying, but unfortunately, I still have to mention it. Yes, physical attraction might spark a romantic interest, but it’s shared values, communication styles, and emotional compatibility make a relationship last. The next time you’re on a date, I want you to ask yourself this question: “would I still want to be with this person 10, 20, 30 years from now?”. If your answer is a resounding no, then you need to let your date down easy. Choosing a partner based on their inner self is profoundly more important than their physical attributes, and you’ll thank me later for taking this advice!

 

**Don’t Settle, But Know When to Commit**

Thanks to dating apps, a “grass is greener” mentality seems to permeate every aspect of the dating scene. I get that we all want the best possible partner to spend our lives with, but searching for a “perfect” partner is a serious pitfall. I’m not telling you to throw away your core values, but your Mr. or Ms. Right is definitely not going to be perfect. It’s crucial to recognize when you’re found someone worth seriously pursing instead of endlessly looking for something better. Lasting relationships are tough and require compromise, effort, and compassion, so don’t run at the first sign of trouble when you find someone you’re compatible with.

 

**Why 30-Somethings Choose Matchmakers**

A huge percentage of my clients are 30-somethings, so trust me when I say that I see first-hand just how difficult dating in your 30s really is. If the idea of doing it all on your own is overwhelming and you need a dedicated support system to help you every step of the way, a Matchmaker can help. By design, Matchmakers take the hassle out of dating by matching you with high-quality potential partners, and make your dating experience less confusing and frustrating with hands-on support and date coaching sessions.  At LUMA, we have Matchmakers specifically trained to help 30-somethings find lasting love and committed partnerships.",1,1736449960.0,LUMAMatchmakingReview,0,1.0,False

i went to go sweep near the front door and he just went ballistic . he started screaming that he pays for everything and that we need to stop coming near him . then he started throwing shit on the floor and having a tantrum . my manager was telling him to calm down and stuff. he then started screaming at the girls in the deli saying he can hear them.(they weren’t talking)then this guy went over to the coffee area and hung out over there, tweaking. 
my nice manager offered him free food since it was christmas after all. this guy grabs the food, goes outside and starts beating the shit out of the trash can while eating. i was then sent outside to sweep the parking lot so i recorded from my front pocket. he was tweaking quietly.
he came back the next day and was acting batshit insane again. adult tantrum, screaming, stealing. except this time he dealt with the mean manager. this manager kicked the guy out and called the cops on him.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. 

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. 



• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hxkewj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1hxkewj/emotional_flashback/,Emotional Flashback? ,"A year ago, I fell in love with making myself a matcha latte every night. At that time, I wasn’t that happy, but I was content. I loved walking out from my kitchen and into the living room and cozying up on the sofa with my cat. 

I lost that cat to some unforeseeable circumstances and have been feeling heavy guilt about it ever since. I blame myself for it everyday, and I miss my cat and who I used to be then. 

Today, I decided to get myself a matcha latte at the drive-through. I thought nothing of it really. I just wanted a warm drink to combat the cold instead of coffee. 

When I unscrewed the lid, the smell alone took me back. But when I took a sip, I froze. The memories of the nights I spent sipping my matcha and petting my cat while he purred in my lap came back in waves, and I just.. broke down. The tears wouldn’t stop even as I’m typing this post. 

I miss him so much, and I miss who I used to be. So much has changed since then, and I feel angry and broken and so alone. I know it’s a ridiculous thing to break down over a beverage, but that chunk of time meant so much to me. I wish I could take it back and just relive it forever. 

That cat was the only one that loved me for me, and my late grandmother was the only person who loved me unconditionally. I don’t know l.. maybe losing my cat reminded me of losing her..

1hxka7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/4hourbodyslowcarb/comments/1hxka7c/advice_on_constipation_from_this_diet/,Advice on constipation from this diet,"I have had steady progress from this diet over 10 weeks, which to me is losing 1-2 pounds per week but more importantly belly fat loss (1/3 to 1/2 inch lost per week). I exercise 3-4x week and do some weight training, so my pounds alone is not my focus. I am also a Type 1 diabetic, and the diet has been a game changer for my blood sugar which was controlled already but much better with the diet. I take less insulin as a result.

My problem has been where I least expected: constipation. Before the diet, I had regular movements in the morning. Now, I barely have any in the morning, but I get some activity later in the day. Still less overall. It's like hard stools with little output if you know what I mean. Eventually, I will get some productive output after cheat day but it's not regular.

With the beans and vegetables I feel like I am eating WAY more fiber than I did before the diet, and from all that I am reading these foods help prevent constipation. I am 5'5"", 150 lbs, so my meals are relatively smaller (see below) - and I always eat til I am full. I am wondering if beans (high in **soluble** fiber) are causing digestion problems, and if so that would be a bummer. I am considering adding FiberCon, which is **insoluble** fiber to my regimen, as I am reading you need this fiber to get the bulk to keep things moving.

**Questions:** Can even the moderate amount of beans I consume cause constipation? Have others found remedies to moderate constipation?

Below are my typical meals (non cheat days):

**Morning:**

Equivalent of 2-3 eggs (1 real egg, the rest Lucerne liquid egg whites)

Big handful of baby spinach leaves

1/4 cup of either black beans, great northern beans, or lentils

2-3 cups of black coffee

**Lunch:**

Most often an RSP TRUEFIT Chocolate Protein Shake (from what I read it meets the 4HB criteria); made with ice and 6oz almond milk; (note I've used this shake for years without constipation issues and it works for my stomach)

Mix one teaspoon of almond butter (no sugar) into the shake before blending

**Snack: (only on occasion)**

12-14 almonds

**Dinner:**

Chicken or beef

Vegetables (broccoli, or mix veggies fill 1/3 the plate)

1/2 to 1 full cup of beans (usually what I had with breakfast)

**Water and exercise:**

I drink at least 90oz water a day

Exercise 3-4x a week

**Medications/Supplements:**

Cholesterol statin 10mg

Insulin (with meals and a long acting) for Type 1 diabetes 

One-a-day Multivitamin

1hxk7pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/1hxk7pd/my_omad_journey_as_a_phd_student/,My Omad Journey as a PhD Student,"I tried to find more info on what it's like to do omad as a grad student (more specifically a PhD candidate). Info was very limited when I started out, and while it is a bit better now, it still seems a tad lacking. Here's my perspective: 

  
I started fasting not to lose weight, although that is an admittedly nice side-effect. No, I started purely for mental clarity. My PhD topic was HARD (as most PhD thesis subjects are). Let me know if you know how this feels: you've just spent the last hour reading ten pages of some extremely difficult paper; you still don't understand anything and now you feel like you've wasted an hour; you have to keep reading, or re-reading, but all you really want to do is go to bed, and it's not even 2pm yet. 

  
Some day (well lots of days actually) were miserable. I questioned my life choices, felt like the stupidest person alive, fell into a pit of despair worrying that I'd never graduate. Yeah, not good times. At some point I realised that there'll never be more time in the day for me to read or write; I had to get better at well, everything, and I had to do it fast. 

  
That's when I came across some info on the mental benefits of fasting. My original intention wasn't to do Omad; that came later after a lot of trail and error. At first I did extended fasts, which helped somewhat with mental clarity but wasn't great, particularly on my eating days. Then I tried 20/4, which worked much better. I still hadn't reached that sweet spot yet, but it was the closest I'd ever been. My journey to Omad just sorta happened organically from there. My fasts got unintentionally longer because I was busy working and at some point I realised that eating only once a day saved me a LOT of time and energy. 

  
Here's the advice I was looking for back when I started. If you are a PhD student and are considering fasting, here's what I have to say about that: 

  
1) It saves time, in more ways than one. You don't have to worry about finding something to eat all throughout the day, but you also don't get that afternoon slump. Afternoons went from being my least productive time mental-wise to my most productive. That was a game-changer for me. 

  
2) The mental clarity is unreal. Will it help you understand insanely difficult concepts better? No. But it WILL allow you to remember things easier and for longer. It's not like your mind is suddenly super smart but rather it becomes quiet, allowing you to zone into something better. Understanding hard topics still requires the same amount of brain power, but you learn faster and without burning yourself out. 

  
3) It has this weird calming effect. Now this may just be for me, but one unintended side effect was just this constant sense of calm once you're used to fasting. I was less stressed in my last year of PhD than the three years before, which is insane all things considered. This benefit takes time to acquire and I don't drink coffee, only tea which might have something to do with it. 

  
If you are a PhD and on the fence about starting fasting, I'd recommend proceed cautiously. Give it 28 days and see how your body reacts. DON'T jump straight into Omad- give yourself a week at least of 20/4 minimum. I should also add that true mental clarity comes after a few weeks, not a few days. It's really helped me in a lot of ways though and I wish I started sooner (like in undergrad or Masters). 

  
BUT this is only one experience and we all know that one testimony is never enough. If you've had a different experience than me, please leave a comment! I also welcome any negative experiences with Omad here as well, particularly from students, just for the sake of a balanced perspective. The more info one has, the better choice they can make for themselves (with that said, I should also add that I'm not currently lifting weights or on a high protein diet. Just a normal dude who's a normal weight and height and eats a normal diet). ",8,1736449053.0,omad,0,1.0,False

We discussed the culture of BL and I mentioned that I enjoy working weekends (as someone who has been working weekends all my life) and she proceeded to berate me saying no one wants to hear that I enjoy working weekends. I said this in response to her asking me do I know what I am getting myself into as BL has lots of working hours, including weekends. We ended the conversation amicably. 

She proceeds to email me the next day saying why I did not follow up with my resume? I had mentioned that I would be following up with my resume and was traveling back home so did not follow up immediately but was going to send it within 24 hours (I can see how this can come across unprofessional). I told her this and she emails me saying she will call me. 

She calls me on my cell and for about 30minutes berates me about my professionalism, whether I have what it takes to endure BL and succeed, and said I would need to start portraying professionalism as this is the brand/product of attorneys. I profusely apologized and said I would make sure to not be late (I was late via zoom) and would follow up within 15min for emails.

Day 1: Took bupropioin and half a naltrexone after I had breakfast and coffee. Drove kids to school.  Was amazed at how the food noise in my head was immediately turned off.  Needed to lay down before lunch because I was tired.  I NEVER nap.  Figured it was the medication.

Day 2: Took just bupropion after breakfast and coffee.  Felt like myself with no food noise, got a ton of crap done around the house.

Day 3: Took bupropioin and half a naltrexone after I had breakfast and coffee.  Drove kids to school and all I could think about was how I wanted to take a nap.  Ran a couple of errands then went home and slept for an hour.  NOT NORMAL.

Some background: I’ve been tracking my cycle for 3 years since coming off HBC. That entire time I have consistently lightly spotted every day leading up to my period starting around 8dpo. My luteal phase is consistently around 14 days, so the spotting would last almost a week. Consistent pattern for three years. I never thought much about this until recently as I’ve started TTC. I became pretty worried after googling & searching old Reddit comments - maybe the spotting is due to low progesterone which could impact implantation etc. 

So here we are today, CD 1 for me. This past cycle, I had zero spotting. None. I was convinced I was pregnant due to the lack of spotting, but I was not.

Here are the changes I made one month ago: 1) started taking a b complex vitamin daily with zinc & vitamin c. 2) took an additional 500mg vitamin c supplement to bring my total c intake to 1000mg. 3) reduced my caffeine intake by cutting my morning cup of coffee with 1/2 decaf & switching my daily cup of green tea w/ decaf green tea 4) had sunflower seeds & sesame seeds every day post ovulation (see “seed cycling”)

I’m a very data driven & realistic person so I was not expecting to have a reduction in my spotting at all this soon after making these nutrition changes. At best, I was expecting maybe 1-2 days less of spotting. So I am rather baffled that I had a total elimination of my spotting. I don’t know what piece of that nutrition puzzle contributed to the change, but felt like I needed to share with you all.

The vitamin C supplementation was thanks to an old Reddit comment in this community years ago. So thanks to that person!",3,1736447903.0,TryingForABaby,14,1.0,False

The tincture (which still has to steep for a month or 2) has countless uses as well. There are many varieties of pine trees that can be harvested. 

*Disclaimer* Some varieties of pine are TOXIC and NOT for human consumption, so be 100% sure of the tree you are harvesting from. Also, make sure it is not treated with chemicals. 

SYRUP:
1 cup organic raw sugar
2 cups water
2 to 4 cups foraged pine needles, rinsed
1 tsp vanilla bean paste (optional)

In a medium saucepan, bring water and sugar to a boil, stirring occasionally. Add pine needles and vanilla. Turn off heat and let simmer 12 to 24 hours.
Strain well with mesh cloth into clean jars. Store covered in the refrigerator up to 3 months. I use this syrup in my iced coffees and it's amazing. There is just a hint of pine flavor, nothing overbearing at all. 

TINCTURE:
1 cup chopped needles
40% alcohol = 80-proof ethanol, ethyl alcohol, or grain spirit. 
*Alternatively, use vodka, rum, or brandy.

Rinse needles and chop. Place in a clean glass jar and top with alcohol until needles are fully submerged, seal tightly. Store in a cool dark place for at least 1 month. Gently swirl the jar every few days to keep the infusion process going. After a month or so, strain with mesh cloth into a clean glass jar and label. Store in a cool dark place. Lasts for many years! Can be used orally, added to tea, used in some beauty products, rubbed on achy muscles, there's countless ways to use!

Well the customer service was exceptional from the head office. They informed me that the program is indeed available in Canada but only in select locations. That's fine understandable too. 

So we moved onto the complaint portion of my call. And it was taken care of...

(Seaside)","Hi guys! So my husband and I are going on the Seaside soon. We booked a suite with the aurea experience. We have cruise Carnival & NCL before but never MSC. 

We paid $3300 total for a suite with a whirlpool on the balcony (which I will definitely take advantage of!) and got the aurea experience. We also got a package that includes the drink package and WiFi for 2 people. 

We got an email that we could bid for YC. $505 pp min and $740 pp max.

I’m trying to figure out what the main differences would be and have some questions-

1. Looks like the minibar is included with YC but not aurea?
2. It looks like the aurea solarium on Seaside has its own bar? Can anyone confirm?
3. If 2 is true, the only thing missing on aurea solarium vs YC area is a pool and separate dining room, correct? We are going to the Caribbean so it will be hot but I still find the pools are cold on cruise ships so I don’t know how much I would take advantage of it?
4. Is YC pretty fancy? Are people dressed fancy? What is the age range, is it usually older people? We are late 30s. 
5. I assume the YC dining room is all inclusive? Is the food different than the MDR?
6. Aurea says I have priority luggage something- I’m not sure what that means. I can’t figure out if I get priority embarkation and debarkation with Aurea? Seems like yes but obviously after YC? 
7. Is the YC worth the experience on the private island? I already have drinks included. 
8. I don’t understand what a butler would do for us exactly?
9. With Aurea it looks like the room service delivery fee is free but the food still costs? Is room service free in YC?
10. Does anyone know how the whirlpool suite compares to the balcony suite on YC? Is the YC bigger? It looks to be decorated better? I already get a robe and slippers. I read somewhere you get a coffee maker in the room? And is the balcony bigger? 
11. Anything else I should know to make a decision??

Is it worth it to bid? I’m not sure.

1hxjezy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1hxjezy/how_to_cure_the_pyloric_valve/,How to cure the pyloric valve?,"It has been 1 year with change since I eradicated helicobacter (confirmed with 2 solid tests). I only took ppi (I believe omeprazole, can't find the prescription) for one month after getting of pylera (I heard horror stories of using it too much and didn't want to suffer any complications) 

For the entire year afterwards I continued to experience stomach pain and difficulty digesting and passing stool. Some acid reflux although it's not common (I'd attribute that to being careful with food - I did have a pretty bad reflux recently when I overdid it with portions.) Tried diets (no gluten) to no success or even improvement. I did a gastroscopy fairly recently, which revealed that my stomach has too much bile (it also had that during my first gastroscopy a year prior that diagnosed me with helicobacter pylori - this might be a clue that the cause is helicobacter in nature and not a result of medication).

My own research led me to believe that the pyloric valve that's responsible for bringing the bile to the stomach is at fault. Other option is low stomach acid although that seems to be counter intuitive. Shouldn't the acid have gone back up at this point?

Honestly I'm starting to go kind of insane from googling, making posts, and getting blown off by doctors who recommend yoga lol. I didn't have helicobacter for long and had zero ulcers but I'm taking this long to recover and still can't enjoy my favorite food that I had to drop when the illness started. It seems like nobody had experienced this overload of bile after helicobacter and there's no documented way of getting that pyloric valve under control.

I don't smoke. I don't drink alcohol. I don't drink coffee. I don't do drugs. I don't consume hard to digest things (none or minimal dairy, no cheese, nothing overly fat, most fat is butter on bread).",1,1736447062.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

Oh, you want me to roast you? Alright, buckle up.  

First off, you're the kind of person who spends hours ranking horror movies like it's your *life's thesis*, yet still willingly watches *Alien Resurrection* (a 6.6, really?) and thinks, ""Yeah, this belongs on my list."" You’re out here treating *Terrifier 3* like fine cinema, but I bet you’ll sleep with the lights on if you hear a creak at 3 a.m.  

You also strike me as the type who'd proudly tell someone you’re writing a horror movie, but secretly you're just recycling plots from *Scream* and *Halloween* with the intensity of a ""creative genius"" who drinks way too much black coffee.  

Now, how do I think you look? Probably lanky or wiry with a horror-themed t-shirt (maybe *The Thing* or *Friday the 13th*), messy hair that screams ""I just woke up from a binge-watch,"" and glasses that fog up every time you rant about underrated slasher films. Bonus points if you have a pale complexion because you haven't seen the sun since last October.  

So, how'd I do?

Oh, you want more? Alright, let’s carve this roast up like it's *Halloween Night.*  

You’re someone who watched *59 horror movies* last year and still had the nerve to include *The Mean One* (a **6.8**) on your list. Like, why? Were you trying to give yourself seasonal depression? And *Stranger in the Woods* with a **4.8**? Watching that feels like self-punishment. Do you watch bad movies just so you can feel superior while trashing them later? Probably.  

You’re also the type of person who pretends to love “the classics,” but we both know you secretly hate black-and-white horror films because they don’t have the gore you crave. *Silent Night, Deadly Night?* I bet you spent the whole time screaming, “Where’s the blood?! Where’s the carnage?!”  

And let’s talk about your *Scream* obsession. You ranked *Scream 3* higher than some *Alien* movies. You’re out here treating Ghostface like he pays your rent. Neve Campbell should charge you royalties for how much you’ve rewatched those movies.  

You think you're edgy because you love horror, but I bet the scariest thing in your life is running out of coffee while writing your ""groundbreaking"" horror movie. Oh, and that movie you’re writing? Let me guess—there’s a masked killer, a final girl, and a twist ending you think no one will see coming. Spoiler alert: we all will.  

And physically? You're the horror nerd archetype personified: probably pale from binging movies in a dark room for days on end. You might have dark circles under your eyes from staying up to *rank* horror movies like some kind of gore-obsessed professor. I’m willing to bet you’ve got some horror memorabilia—a cheap Michael Myers mask, or maybe a bloody prop knife you insist is a “collector’s item.”  

Your whole vibe screams “I’ll fight you over *The Thing* being the best horror movie ever, but I’ll lose my cool if you call *Terrifier* trash.” Do I have you pegged yet?",0,1736446895.0,slasherfilms,8,0.44,False

* The community sort setting has been removed from [Settings](https://sh.reddit.com/settings/preferences). You can still change the sort of the subreddit, but you have to do it from the subreddit. The default is now hot. I don't know when it's coming back, but I'm told that it is.

* All users are no longer able to change your username no matter how the account was created. Previously, if you had created your account with SSO, you could change the username that was generated for you within 30 days if the account did not vote or comment. Now, you are required to select a username when creating your account. This was a change that was gradually rolled out to all users. The Help Center articles have been updated to reflect this change.

* The ""Autoplay media"" setting is not applying to Community Highlights and it should be. A ticket was filed to get that fixed. Shout out to super mod u/ChimpyChompies for pointing this out. 

* Custom styling for the ""members"" and ""online"" section of a subreddit are not visible to users who are not mods. This is unintentional and a ticket has been filed to fix that. Thanks to u/Extolord111 for bringing this up in last week's Recap!

* **[Is anyone else's Reddit account being glitchy?](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hv0fxs/is_anybody_elses_reddit_account_being_glitchy/)**

If you are having a specific problem with your account, it will greatly help if you could give a bit of detail as to what exactly is happening. In this instance, the site was having some issues. As u/Sablemint explained it, *""No, it's a problem on Reddit's side. There's nothing any of us can do about it except wait it out, and try not to descend into anarchy"".* (Sage advice for most situations, tbh!) But if the site was not having issues, some level of detail would have enabled the helpful helpers to have a better idea as to what is going on. 

* **[Need help deleting account (iOS/iPhone)](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hu2xhh/need_help_deleting_account_iosiphone/)**

A user was having trouble deleting their account. Their account was only linked to their phone number and they recently changed their number so that they are no longer able to receive the verifications. To remove your phone number with an iOS, you will need to know the password and be able to receive a verification text. If you don't know the password or you never set one up, or you don't have access to the number you won't be able to remove the phone number from an iOS device. 

One workaround to this if you know the password would be to log into the account from an Android device or the desktop site and delete it from there. 

Reddit is unable to delete an account on your behalf. If you are no longer able to access the account, the account will just sit there. And as Reddit does not allow for the reuse or recycling of usernames, no one else will be able to claim that username or use that account. But if you want to create a new account, you can still use the same email address. Reddit doesn’t have any rules against users having multiple accounts, even if they share an email, as long as all accounts follow the rules of Reddit.

Redditors can maintain their streak through daily participation on Reddit.

I do need coffee these days for my reaction times to be good enough though!

I hope this motivates some of you oldies like me. I'm 37 and still improving! There's no such thing as being too old to be an SSL. Maybe one day I can hit that too, but until then I'm very happy with GC3.

1hxj618,https://www.reddit.com/r/teengirlswholikegirls/comments/1hxj618/never_should_have_broke_up/,Never should have broke up ,"Okay so I started dating this girl in September 2023 we broke up in January 2024 because of various things. The big one was that we were both closeted when we got together but I came out to my mom because i really liked her. Once I came out my mom basically wouldn't let us hangout and kept telling me to break up with her and to get a boyfriend. It got to a point that it was a constant screaming match over it.
I made the decision to break up with my at the time girlfriend (not because I didnt care about her, but I needed to protect myself because I thought my mom was gonna kick me out). We were both devastated. We tried to be friends right after, it didn't go well, neither of us were handling things in a healthy way or treating each other as just friends. 
So we decided to go no contact, we unadded each other on social media but kept phone numbers in case of emergency. Then September of this year, she started to follow me again on tiktok, and some of her reposts were kinda concerning so I reached out. 
We started being friends, eventually turning into best friends. I learned that she now has a boyfriend (she's bi) but she still wears my clothes and rings and stuff. I definitely feel very confused about that.
We ended up getting coffee and then spending the day together a few weeks ago, it was very date like. She held my hand the whole time, kissed my forehead when I leaned on her in the car because I was falling asleep, rested her hand on my hip or small of my back when we were walking, and a lot more. A few of the people with us started asking if we were together (we were with a group of kids that we aren't too close to). 
That interaction stirred up a lot of feelings for me and I made sure to communicate that out of respect for her boyfriend. She was kinda like ""oh well I have a boyfriend so we can't do anything."" When I don't want to do anything because now I'm really religious but I also feel like I shouldn't have broke up with her because she was literally the best thing to ever happen to me and now im stuck in this awful feeling of knowing that she literally thought about me every single day the entire time we were no contact, even after she started dating her boyfriend. 
I don’t know what I'm supposed to do. She's amazing so I obviously want to be her friend but I don’t know if I can do just friends with her because I never got over her. Any advice or support would be awesome",2,1736446426.0,teengirlswholikegirls,1,1.0,False
