And we think that they are the ones who have been through real struggles of life and that's why they are there. They are the real heroes. But I think each one of us is also going through a lot these days. 

We don't tell anyone but we're all sobbing late at night. Trust me I am, So I thought of why not creating a space for us Mango people too. We are also important and we have a lot of amazing stories too. 

Anyone out there, who wants to share something with this world. And it's not for them, it's for us. Its always about us, isn't it?

He was glistening with some kind of feeling i couldn‚Äôt feel the feeling but I could feel the calm, I could feel the storm, I could feel the warm. I did not go close to him, I just stood beside him was his mother, feeding him, it was kinda red. The day was sinking the dark was rising and there he sat with his mother gently, enjoying his food like after a long day of work. I could experience his feel, his thoughts fading - taking mine with him while I did delve into newer ones and he delves into his kin. It made me glad and opened the gates of empty hole inside of me at the same time. To be really honest, I can never feel what he really felt but yet it made me dream about it, It made me go back, It made me relive some moments, It made me open up my mind and find some things which I think I had closed off a long time ago. It broke me and the more I dwelled on it. The more the reality hit me. The more it made me realize what I am, but still the fact that I had to submit an assignment by tomorrow didn‚Äôt leave my mind. I couldn‚Äôt deny what I was feeling but I also could‚Äôt determine what I was feeling. Things come and go so swiftly that I can‚Äôt even observe, digest. I think life had stopped a long time before but I thought it was moving forward so I kept on chasing. I have lost my path now. But, still the moment from yesterday hit me so hard that it made me write with shaking hands. The song ‚ÄòOde to the Mets‚Äô just keeps playing in my head and all I think is that I hope it doesn‚Äôt lose its kick, that it doesn‚Äôt break me like the moment. I feel like I am drinking a coffee but with my nose. The sheer bitterness of it kind of resonates with something that I think is inside me. While I want to write more, I have a class in 10 minutes and I will attend it while I won‚Äôt be mentally, I will be sitting in library listening to ‚Äòode to the Mets‚Äô reflecting on something not real.

1nfpuhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1nfpuhc/my_friend_just_ambushed_me_with_a_quite_hurtful/,my friend just ambushed me with a quite hurtful message,"I'd like to begin by saying I have a hard time maintaining friendships. I do have a good amount of friends and acquaintances, at the same time many of my friendships fell apart. 

The friend I am talking about in this post, let's call her Emily, is currently one of my best friends. Emily and I met at work earlier this year, and since then we've been spending a lot of time together outside of work. We have a lot in common, and I genuinely tried to put extra effort in nurturing our friendship. Every time we had a full day off (we both work two jobs), I would take us somewhere. Shopping, hiking, coffee shops. We went out drinking several times, she met my partner and my friends. Overall, it was going great. And since Emily and I are both bilingual in the same languages and have similar cultural background, I felt like I finally found a person who I can relate to in terms of my culture. 

Today, I replied to her voice messages. She was just talking about the drama at work. She got back to me saying ""no problem, you don't have to text me back if you don't want to"", ""I am being ignored"", ""I have a feeling that you and I have a different perspective of what a friendship should be like"". 

I don't think you can imagine how confused I was. What did I say? She did bring up a specific time I mentioned that whenever I sent a long voice message, I empty my thoughts into the void. I was talking about myself, and in no way I was comparing my friend to the void. It was a joke too. Still I tried to figure it out, I apologized, and she ended our conversation with ""let's move on"". 

At first I was confused, but then I got really angry. Literally, I always reply to her, I tried to introduce her to all of my friends, I made a website for her at no cost, I picked her up every time and drove us to different places, I bought breakfast for us many times when Emily and I had a shift on the same day. We never had a fight or an argument before. When did her anger towards me come from? 

I am so sad and hurt. I don't know how we are going to work together tomorrow. I am so tired of making new friendships only to go through this three months later. I don't feel appreciated anymore. And I don't know what to do. I don't want to apologize again in person. I already apologized four times over text. I don't want to bring this up, and hopefully she won't either. But I do feel like our friendship is forever different now. ",1,1757743275.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I drank it not really thinking but then I woke up the next day and got invited to Dunkin so I went and got the Sabrina Refresher being told by someone (not a worker) there was no caffeine in it (googled it and apparently there is?) and splurged on a medium because someone had a free drink reward, I also had a soda before I left, not thinking again I drank it all pretty fast, next day I feel like the world is ending.

Then my phone buzzes.

**Bank notification: -$347.83**

My heart drops. Did someone steal my card? Hack my account?

Nope. Worse.

It was subscription renewal day. All at once. Like some cruel monthly lottery I never signed up to play.

# A week of coding later...

I built something. Nothing fancy - just a clean app where you can:

**Track every subscription** ( add manually)  
**Get renewal reminders** before your card gets hit  
**See spending patterns** (spoiler: it's always worse than you think)

**Budget forecasting** so you know what's coming  
**Calendar view** because visualizing pain helps somehow

# Where we're at now üìä

**The numbers:**

* 4 paying customers (my first revenue ever!)
* $17 MRR (it ain't much, but it's honest work)
* 283 active users

# Why this matters for entrepreneurs & AI startups

Look, we're all subscription addicts. Whether you're:

 **Running an AI startup** \- You're probably paying for OpenAI, Claude, Midjourney, 5 different no-code tools, analytics platforms...

 **Building a SaaS** \- Marketing tools, development platforms, customer service software, the list never ends...

 **Bootstrapping anything** \- Every dollar matters, but subscription creep is real and it's expensive.

  
How do you handle your own subscription chaos? And seriously, what's a fair price for saving someone $100+ per month?

## What is Shift Kantrex?

Shift Kantrex is an **automated trading platform** that uses algorithms to analyze the market and execute trades on your behalf. Think of it like a robot assistant that buys low and sells high‚Äîexcept it doesn‚Äôt sleep, doesn‚Äôt panic, and doesn‚Äôt need coffee.

The platform supports multiple asset types, including **cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, and CFDs**, so you can diversify your trades. It claims to offer **smart trading technology** that spots opportunities faster than a human can, which is the core appeal.

For folks who don‚Äôt want to sit in front of a screen all day chart-watching, Shift Kantrex offers a sort of ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù option. But it‚Äôs not completely hands-free‚Äîyou still have to set parameters and monitor your account occasionally.

## Who Created Shift Kantrex?

Honestly, this is where things get a bit fuzzy.

Shift Kantrex doesn‚Äôt publicly list its developers or founding team, which is pretty standard for these types of platforms. It‚Äôs likely powered by a group of fintech experts or white-label software providers who‚Äôve also built platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**.

While the lack of transparency might set off some alarms, it‚Äôs not uncommon in this space. Many similar platforms keep things vague to avoid legal complications or regulatory scrutiny. Still, it'd be nice to know who‚Äôs behind the curtain.

### [üî• Start Trading with Shift Kantrex Today](https://tinyurl.com/2a2yzzsa)
## How Does Shift Kantrex Work?

At its core, Shift Kantrex uses **automated trading bots** powered by AI and machine learning algorithms. These bots analyze massive amounts of market data in real time, looking for patterns and trends that could indicate a good buy or sell moment.

Here's a simplified breakdown of how trading works on Shift Kantrex:

- You sign up and fund your account with a **minimum deposit of $250**.
- You customize your trading settings (risk level, asset type, trade size, etc.).
- The bot scans the market, makes trades, and hopes to profit from market movements.
- You monitor your account, withdraw profits, or reinvest.

It‚Äôs not magic, but it can be effective‚Äîespecially in volatile markets where quick reactions matter.

## Shift Kantrex Pros and Cons

Let‚Äôs keep it real‚Äîno platform is perfect. Here‚Äôs what I liked and what could be better:

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Automated Trading** ‚Äì No need to constantly monitor charts or news.
- ‚úÖ **Beginner-Friendly Interface** ‚Äì Easy to use, even if you‚Äôre new to trading.
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Asset Support** ‚Äì Trade crypto, forex, and commodities in one place.
- ‚úÖ **Demo Account Available** ‚Äì Practice with fake money before going live.
- ‚úÖ **Customizable Settings** ‚Äì Set your own risk levels and trading preferences.

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **No Clear Info on Founders** ‚Äì Always a little sketchy.
- ‚ùå **Not Regulated** ‚Äì Like many similar platforms, it lacks formal regulation.
- ‚ùå **Risk of Loss** ‚Äì Automated doesn‚Äôt mean guaranteed profit.
- ‚ùå **Aggressive Marketing** ‚Äì Some partner sites make it sound like easy money.

### [üëâ Open Your Shift Kantrex Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/2a2yzzsa)

## Shift Kantrex ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Shift Kantrex uses real-time data streams to **analyze the market** and detect trends. This means the bots can react quickly‚Äîsometimes within milliseconds‚Äîto changing conditions. Definitely a win if you're trading volatile assets like crypto.

### User-Friendly Interface

Shift Kantrex supports trading in:
- **Cryptocurrencies** (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.)
- **Forex Pairs** (USD/EUR, GBP/JPY, etc.)
- **Commodities** (Gold, Oil, etc.)
- **CFDs** ‚Äì Contracts for Difference

This lets you **spread your risk** and try out different markets.

## Is Shift Kantrex a Scam?

Short answer? It doesn‚Äôt look like one, but it‚Äôs not 100% transparent either.

There‚Äôs no clear info about the team behind it, and it‚Äôs not officially regulated. But based on **user reviews**, test accounts, and how it operates‚Äîit appears to be a **legit trading platform** that actually works.

That said, always invest what you can afford to lose. Automated trading is still risky, and no bot is perfect.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Shift Kantrex?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for platforms like this. You can deposit using:

- Credit/Debit Card
- Bank Transfer
- Some eWallets (depending on your country)

No crypto-only deposit requirements, which is nice if you‚Äôre just starting out.

### Shift Kantrex Customer Support

Support is available **24/7**, and you can reach them via:
- Live Chat (pretty responsive)
- Email (slower but helpful)

They also offer an FAQ section and onboarding support when you register. I found the reps polite and decently informed‚Äînot bad for a platform in this category.

## How do you start trading on Shift Kantrex?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head over to their site and fill out the registration form. Just your **name, email, and phone number**. Takes 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

## How to Delete a Shift Kantrex Account?

If you want out, just contact customer support and request account deletion. They‚Äôll ask you to verify your identity, and you‚Äôre good to go. If you have funds left, make sure to **withdraw before deleting**.

### [üî• Start Trading with Shift Kantrex Today](https://tinyurl.com/2a2yzzsa)
## The Verdict

So, is Shift Kantrex worth checking out? **Yes‚Äîif you know what to expect.**

It‚Äôs a solid choice for people looking to dip their toes into automated trading without diving deep into technical analysis. The platform is **easy to use, supports multiple assets**, and comes with a demo mode to test things out.

That said, it‚Äôs not regulated and the creators are anonymous, which is common in this space but worth noting. Don‚Äôt expect guaranteed profits‚Äîand definitely don‚Äôt bet the rent money.

If you‚Äôre curious and have $250 to try it out, Shift Kantrex could be a cool way to explore automated trading without getting overwhelmed.

Arjun nodded: **""Yeah, the school art competition**. But what if mine looks really silly? Everyone else is better?

I set my coffee down and told him a secret: when I was his age, I entered an art competition too. Mt drawing of a dog looked more like a potato with legs. I didn't win, but I told him, I wish someone had told me back then;

Art isn't about being the best. It's about showing the people how you see the world . Nobody else has your imagination. That's your superpower.""

When it was time, Arjun turned in his piece, a drawing of an old tree in our backyard where we always sit together. It wasn't flashy, but it was him.

***The winners were announced. His name wasn't called. I saw his eyes drop, shoulders sink. My heart broke for him.***

But hear what I did: I clapped louder than anyone in the room because what he did took courage. Here put his heart on paper and shared it with the world. That's something medals and ribbons can't measure.

On the way home, he asked quietly So...did I do good?

## What is Gain Mode AI?

**Gain Mode AI** is an automated trading platform that uses algorithms and artificial intelligence to analyze market trends and execute trades. Think of it like your personal trading assistant that doesn‚Äôt sleep, doesn‚Äôt panic, and reacts to market shifts faster than you can blink.

It‚Äôs designed to make trading accessible, especially for people who don‚Äôt have time to dive deep into market charts or learn technical analysis. The idea is that the AI does all the heavy lifting‚Äîspotting opportunities and placing trades for you, either automatically or with your approval.

The big pitch? It claims to help users make smarter trades with less effort. Not magic, but definitely smarter.

## Who Created Gain Mode AI?

There‚Äôs not a ton of public info about the developers behind Gain Mode AI. It's a little vague, which I know might raise eyebrows. But this is actually not uncommon with these kinds of platforms. What I could dig up suggests that it's built by a group of fintech professionals and AI engineers who‚Äôve previously worked on similar trading systems.

While some might see this as a red flag, it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù situation. The platform feels polished and functional, which tells me the dev team knows what they‚Äôre doing‚Äîeven if they‚Äôre staying behind the curtain.

## How Does Gain Mode AI Work?

Gain Mode AI connects you with third-party brokers and uses advanced algorithms to scan the market in real time. It identifies patterns, reacts to market signals, and can either suggest trades or execute them automatically if you enable auto-trading.

Here‚Äôs a simplified version of what happens under the hood:

- AI scans thousands of trades and market signals per second
- It identifies high-probability trading opportunities
- Depending on your settings, it either trades for you or alerts you
- You monitor, tweak, and withdraw profits (hopefully)

Basically, it removes a lot of the guesswork and emotional decision-making from the trading process‚Äîwhich is a huge win for beginners.

## Gain Mode AI Pros and Cons

Let‚Äôs keep it real‚Äîno platform is perfect. Here‚Äôs the good and the not-so-good I found while testing Gain Mode AI:

### Pros:
- **Super beginner-friendly** interface
- **AI-powered analysis** is impressively fast
- **Demo mode** lets you practice before risking money
- **Mobile support**, so you can trade on the go
- Trades across **multiple asset classes**
- **24/7 customer support** actually responds

### Cons:
- **$250 minimum deposit** might be steep for casual users
- **No clear info about the dev team**
- Some features are **broker-dependent**, which can vary

It‚Äôs not flawless, but for a platform like this, it‚Äôs honestly better than I expected.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Gain Mode AI?

Gain Mode AI works on pretty much any modern device. I tested it on my laptop, tablet, and phone‚Äîit‚Äôs fully web-based, so you don‚Äôt need to download anything.

- **Desktop/Laptop**: Full access, best for digging into charts and settings
- **Smartphones**: Works well on both Android and iOS browsers
- **Tablets**: A solid middle-ground option, great UI

There‚Äôs no native mobile app (yet), but the mobile site is responsive and smooth enough.

## Gain Mode AI ‚Äì Supported Countries

Gain Mode AI is available in most countries, including the **U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia**, and much of **Europe**. However, it‚Äôs **not available** in regions with strict trading regulations like **North Korea, Iran**, or some parts of **Asia and Africa**.

When you sign up, it automatically checks if your country is supported. If not, you‚Äôll get an error message.

## Gain Mode AI ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The AI doesn't just guess‚Äîit scans and analyzes market trends in real-time. This means you‚Äôre getting **up-to-the-second updates**, which can be a game changer when markets are moving fast.

### User-Friendly Interface

Everything is laid out in a way that‚Äôs super clean. Even if you have zero trading experience, you won‚Äôt feel overwhelmed. I appreciated how the dashboard avoids jargon and just gives you what you need.

### Mobile Accessibility

You can stay on top of your trades while chilling at a coffee shop or commuting. The mobile version is responsive, smooth, and doesn‚Äôt sacrifice any core features.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up custom alerts based on price movements, trade opportunities, or news events. This is great if you prefer to keep control without going fully auto.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You‚Äôre not limited to just crypto. Gain Mode AI supports trading in **Forex, stocks, commodities**, and more. It‚Äôs like having a multi-tool instead of a one-trick pony.

## Is Gain Mode AI a Scam?

From what I‚Äôve seen and tested, **Gain Mode AI doesn‚Äôt come off as a scam**. It works with registered brokers, offers a demo account, and doesn‚Äôt make wild ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù claims (a good sign). That said, always be cautious‚Äîespecially with third-party brokers.

A few tips:
- Start with the demo mode
- Don‚Äôt invest more than you can afford to lose
- Withdraw profits regularly

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Gain Mode AI?

You‚Äôll need to deposit **$250** to start trading on Gain Mode AI. This is pretty standard for platforms in this space. The money goes directly into your trading account with the connected broker, not to Gain Mode AI itself.

### Gain Mode AI Customer Support

I tested their 24/7 live chat and email support. Surprisingly, they responded within 5 minutes, and the answers were *actually helpful*. They also follow up via email, which shows they‚Äôre trying to keep users happy.

## How do you start trading on Gain Mode AI?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the official Gain Mode AI site and fill in your name, email, and phone number. You don‚Äôt need to add payment info right away.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You‚Äôll be matched with a broker. Once verified, you can make the **$250 deposit** via credit card, bank transfer, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can use **demo mode** first (highly recommended), or jump straight into live trading. You can tweak risk settings and enable or disable auto-trading any time.

## How to Delete a Gain Mode AI Account?

If you ever want to delete your account, just contact support via live chat or email. They‚Äôll walk you through the process, and it only takes a day or two. Make sure to **withdraw your funds first.**

## The Verdict

So‚Ä¶ is Gain Mode AI worth it?

If you‚Äôre new to trading or just don‚Äôt have time to babysit charts all day, **Gain Mode AI is honestly one of the better AI trading platforms** I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs simple to use, surprisingly responsive, and offers enough customization to feel in control.

That said, it‚Äôs not a magic ATM. There are risks, and you still need to use basic money management. But if you‚Äôre smart about it, the potential is there.

Would I recommend it? **Yeah, cautiously‚Äîbut yes.**

I was told the whole story by someone who used to be close to my mother and then I made my own research with other people that were present at the time. My father was a Russian immigrant here. He came with his siblings and their mother. No father. My mother is wealthy and he used to work for her family. Its a common practice in this neighbourhood even now - to have teenagers who work during the summer in people's yards - cleaning the pool, taking care of the garden and so on. That was what my dad was doing.  His English was broken, elementary, I was told and he was working in my mother's yard. He and some of his siblings, I believe 2 sisters.

I was born a few days before he turned 18 and when he turned 18 he got married to my mother and she was very abusive. Controlling, possessive, made him limit and then cut contact with his family. He stayed married to her for 5 or 6 years. She caught him cheating with the woman his age that was babysitting me.

I reached out at 15 and he hesitantly agreed to meet but I had to take an adult with me and it was my mother. She didn't get inside the coffee shop with me but looked at the interraction from the street and he kept looking at her. Wasn't comfortable at all. I look just like him. Blue eyes, light brown hair, thin and and tall. I couldn't believe how similar we are. He is married to someone. I was 15. I knew he has his reasons to avoid Mom but I felt so rejected. I brought him something  I painted and wanted to get to know him while he was cold and distant and he made me feel like trash. We met again because I wanted it and he was warmer this time and asked me questions about me but didn't really want to tell me anything about his life. 

In the end, even at 15, I felt he doesn't want me and I felt rejected so I wrote him a text on IG that I don't want to be a burden for him nor do I want him to keep in contact when he clearly doesn't want me. My text was so long and his reply was: You don't understand but I can't do this.

Now I am 19 and he reached out. Why? Should I give him a chance? he hurt me so much at 15. I was just a kid. Just wanted to know my Dad.

Mother told me he cheated on her a lot and once hit her head against the table. I asked him about this and he admitted he did it. Because she didn't tell him and make sure he doesn't know that his mother died. And also that ex friend of her told me that Dad once was drunk and angry and crying and he ra...ped my Mom.

A bakery is a place that produces and sells flour-based baked goods like bread, cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, and pies, often serving coffee or tea for on-premise enjoyment in some formats. In some markets, bakeries lean toward breads while p√¢tisseries focus on sweet, refined pastries as a distinct category.[wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakery)

# Core bakery categories

* Bread and rolls: from baguettes and sourdough to multigrain and brioche, bread remains the daily staple anchoring the category worldwide. Key buying drivers include freshness and natural ingredients across age groups and markets.
* Cakes and pastries: layer cakes, cupcakes, croissants, danishes, and √©clairs offer indulgence and celebration value, increasingly shaped by seasonal launches and social media aesthetics.
* Cookies and biscuits: shortbread, chocolate chip, and tea biscuits span snack and gifting use-cases, with packaging and shelf life central to quality perception and convenience.

# How bakeries make products

Bakers measure and combine ingredients, knead to develop gluten, proof dough to rise, then shape and bake to golden finishes, creating textures from open-crumb sourdough to flaky laminated pastries. Daily routines start early and rely on precise control of fermentation, oven temperature, and timing for consistent results.  
Common ingredients like wheat flour, sugar, fats, leavening, and water provide structure, tenderness, and lift, with multifunctional add-ins like fiber-rich by-products gaining traction for nutrition and sustainability.

# Quality, freshness, and safety

Freshness and perceived quality drive purchase decisions, with many consumers equating quality to health benefits, naturalness, and clean labels, while private labels gain share for value. Food safety systems guide processing, storage, and distribution practices to minimize hazards in breads, biscuits, and cakes.  
Packaging influences shelf life by controlling moisture and oxygen, helping prevent staling and spoilage while maintaining sensory quality within acceptable thresholds.

# Bakery trends in 2025

* Better-for-you bakes: launches with digestive and gut-health benefits are rising, including fiber-rich, fermented, and sourdough-forward items that align with ‚Äúflourish from within.‚Äù Consumers across generations weigh freshness, healthfulness, and safety differently when assessing quality.
* Bold flavor innovation: ‚Äúswicy‚Äù and ‚Äúswalty‚Äù profiles, citrus-forward notes, and fusion-inspired creations are expanding, as bakers balance authenticity with modern twists to captivate social-first audiences. Visual appeal on Instagram and TikTok accelerates trend adoption and product discovery.
* Sustainability and automation: from energy-efficient ovens and eco-packaging to AI-assisted production planning, bakeries pursue efficiency and lower footprints without sacrificing craft.

# Starting or marketing a bakery

Effective marketing blends brand storytelling, visual assets, and product showcases, supported by analytics to track what converts footfall and online orders. Content ideas include behind-the-scenes workflows, seasonal specialties, and practical baking tips to establish authority and nurture loyalty.  
Social content that spotlights ‚Äúday in the life,‚Äù trend-led bakes, and community features earns engagement; encouraging user-generated content via hashtags and tutorials amplifies reach and trust.

As style becomes more about timeless quality than fleeting trends, men are beginning to rethink their basics. One item leading this quiet revolution? The **luxury t-shirt for men**.

No longer just a throw-on piece for the weekend, today‚Äôs **men luxury t shirt** combines premium materials, tailored fits, and understated sophistication. It's the ideal fusion of comfort and elegance‚Äîproving that true style starts with what you wear every day.

Whether you're a minimalist dresser or someone who values refined fashion, a well-made t-shirt can do more than you might think. In this article, we‚Äôll explore why **premium t shirts**, **designer t shirts for men**, and [**luxury polo t shirts**](https://luxuryatless.store) are reshaping men‚Äôs wardrobes‚Äîand how you can get **Luxury at Less** without compromising quality.

# What Defines a Luxury T-Shirt for Men?

So what exactly makes a t-shirt ""luxury""? Is it the price? The brand? Not necessarily. A **luxury t-shirt for men** is defined by three key pillars: fabric, fit, and finish.

# 1. Fabric: The Foundation of Luxury

The best garments begin with superior materials. **Men's premium t-shirts** are typically made from long-staple cottons such as Pima or Supima. These cottons have longer fibers, which make the fabric softer, smoother, and more durable.

Other luxury options might include bamboo blends, which offer natural breathability, or modal, known for its silky texture and moisture-wicking properties. These fabrics are gentle on the skin and maintain their quality wash after wash‚Äîsomething cheaper shirts can't promise.

# 2. Fit: Tailored to Perfection

Luxury isn‚Äôt about being flashy‚Äîit‚Äôs about looking effortlessly polished. A well-made **men luxury t shirt** fits close to the body without being too tight. It should contour the shoulders, fall neatly at the hem, and offer a flattering silhouette.

Brands specializing in **premium t shirts** often offer various fits‚Äîslim, classic, and relaxed‚Äîso you can choose the one that suits your body type and style preference.

# 3. Finish: Every Detail Counts

From reinforced stitching to pre-shrunk fabric, luxury tees are crafted with long-term wear in mind. Double-needle hems, tagless labels, and smooth collar taping all contribute to a refined wearing experience. When it comes to **best quality t shirt** options, craftsmanship is key.

# Why Premium T-Shirts Are Gaining Popularity

There‚Äôs a reason why **men's premium t-shirts** are more than just a passing trend‚Äîthey offer real value. Here‚Äôs why more men are making the switch:

* **Longevity**: They last longer, resisting shape distortion and color fading.
* **Comfort**: Better fabrics = more comfortable wear, all day long.
* **Style**: A luxury tee is versatile enough for nearly every setting‚Äîfrom coffee runs to casual workdays.
* **Sustainability**: Many high-end brands focus on ethical sourcing and responsible production.

Today‚Äôs fashion-savvy man isn‚Äôt just buying clothes‚Äîhe‚Äôs investing in wardrobe essentials that look good, feel great, and perform well.

# Designer T-Shirts for Men: Understated Sophistication

If you think designer clothes are only about loud logos and flashy branding, think again. The modern **designer t shirt for men** is all about minimalist style and luxurious comfort.

High-end designers now create tees that feature subtle detailing, refined cuts, and high-performance fabrics. They‚Äôre perfect for layering under a blazer, pairing with denim, or even dressing up with tailored pants.

The beauty of a **designer t shirt for men** is its simplicity‚Äîit makes a quiet statement of confidence and style.

# Luxury Polo T-Shirts: A Smarter Alternative

For those who prefer a collar without the formality of a dress shirt, the **luxury polo t shirt** is the ultimate choice. It strikes the perfect balance between casual and smart, making it ideal for events, date nights, or even business-casual settings.

Crafted from soft, breathable materials like pique cotton or jersey knit, today‚Äôs **luxury polo t shirts** are far from the stiff, outdated styles of the past. They offer the same attention to detail and fabric quality as top-tier tees, with the added polish of a structured collar.

# Luxury at Less: Quality Without the Price Tag

Luxury doesn‚Äôt have to mean overpriced. The concept of **Luxury at Less** has changed the game by offering **men luxury t shirts** and **premium t shirts** at a fraction of the traditional cost.

Thanks to direct-to-consumer brands, streamlined supply chains, and sustainable practices, you can now access the **best quality t shirt** without breaking the bank. These brands focus on core wardrobe staples, offering limited but high-performing pieces that rival big-name designers‚Äîwithout the markup.

Look out for companies that are transparent about where their fabrics come from, how their products are made, and how they price them. That's real luxury.

# How to Style Men‚Äôs Premium T-Shirts

Want to make the most of your luxury t-shirt? Here are a few easy outfit ideas to upgrade your look:

# 1. Casual & Clean

Pair a white **men luxury t shirt** with slim-fit jeans and leather sneakers. Add a bomber jacket for cool-weather versatility.

# 2. Elevated Office Casual

Tuck a charcoal **premium t shirt** into tailored trousers. Finish with suede loafers and a blazer for a comfortable yet polished look.

# 3. Weekend Sophistication

Try a navy **luxury polo t shirt** with chino shorts and loafers for relaxed summer style.

# 4. Monochrome Mood

Match a black **designer t shirt for men** with black jeans and minimalist sneakers for a sleek, modern vibe.

# What to Look for When Buying the Best Quality T-Shirt

If you‚Äôre shopping for a **luxury t-shirt for men**, keep these criteria in mind:

* **Fabric:** Opt for long-staple cotton or eco-conscious blends.
* **GSM (Grams per Square Meter):** Look for 160‚Äì220 GSM for durability and comfort.
* **Fit:** Choose based on your style‚Äîclassic for versatility, slim for modern polish.
* **Seams & Finish:** Clean stitching, smooth collars, and reinforced hems.
* **Brand Values:** Support companies that prioritize ethical production and sustainability.

1nfphe7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nfphe7/blackstar_chapter_one/,*Blackstar* Chapter One,"Doug entered the small coffee shop, the door slid aside with a soft hiss. He was tall, 6'2"", slim in build. He had dark, black, uncombable hair, which was now slightly damp from the mist outside. He wore a leather jacket and faded jeans.  His boots were damp from walking on the wet pavement outside.



His contact, Lena, was already sitting at a booth. She was nearly as tall as Doug. She stood at 5'11"", with short sandy brown hair. Her eyes are hazel in color. She was wearing a navy blue pullover and faded jeans. 



Doug slid into the booth next to her. ""Took you long enough. What happened? Was there an alien attack, or did the bus break down again?"" She gave him an impish grin. 



""Neither,"" he replied. He didn't elaborate. His face was flushed, and there was what looked like blood on his forehead. Lena saw the blood and frowned.



She searched his face, seeking answers. ""Give,"" she growled. ""What happened? Is it something to do with \*Blackstar\*?"" He nodded. ""Yeah, at the old warehouse on Beacon Street.""



Doug began his tale. ""I had trailed a \*Blackstar\* op to the old warehouse. I was following close, but not close enough to be seen. The op had opened the warehouse door and left it ajar. I made my way to the door and peered in."" He paused a moment as if remembering what he had seen.



He resumed his tale. ""Several people were standing around the shipment we are tracking. The shipment was not what we thought it was. It was not counterfeited goods, but high-tech. I've never seen anything like it.""



Lena considered this info, then asked, ""What do you do then?""



""I used my cellphone to take pictures. Somebody must have spotted me. Next thing I knew, a bullet grazed my forehead. I ran. Zig-zaged till I got here.""



""Show me the pictures, "" she commanded. Doug handed Lena the cellphone. Lena studied the pictures, trying to process what she was seeing. 



Sudden instinct made Lena look up and out the window. A man in a dark suit stood casually by the corner street lamp. It looked as if he was waiting for something or someone. 



""Don't look now, but I think someone is watching us,"" she whispered.  Just then, the waitress came over and asked if they needed anything else. She also told them the coffee shop would be closing in 20 minutes. Lena shook her head, and the waitress went away.



""We need to leave. Act casual."" Doug nodded and put a bill on the table. They left the cafe and turned west on Lenora Street. The man in the business suit didn't follow; instead, he used his cellphone - ""They are heading west on Lenora Street."" The reply came back, ""Do not follow.""



Doug and Lena walked like lovers, holding hands. There was an alleyway that both Doug and Lena knew well. When they got to the alleyway, they turned in and started running. They could hear cars in the distance coming their way.



They paused by a hidden door, which looked like the alley wall. Doug pushed on the hidden panel, and the door swung inward, creaking as it did so. They rushed inside and closed the door.



Inside was a dimly lit staircase heading down. When they reached the bottom, there were three archways. They took the left one. The hallway continued for a hundred meters, where another door waited.



This door required a card pass. Lena took out her card pass and swiped the door lock. The door slid open with a whoosh. They entered the room, and the door slid shut with another whoosh.



The room looked like a modern hotel suite. There was a couch, two comfy chairs, a dining table/with chairs, a small bar, and a large wall-mounted TV. Plush carpeting, polished oak wooden walls, a small, well-equipped kitchen, and two other doors could be seen. One door led to a master sized bedroom, the other to a large, lavish bathroom.



""Well,"" remarked Doug, ""all the comforts of home."" Lena nodded, ""Courtesy of OS."" 



""Let's see what's in the refrigerator. I'm hungry,"" said Doug. While he looked in the refrigerator, Lena poured them each a drink. Doug prepared two dishes and set them down on the dining table. Lena brought over the drinks, and they both sat down. 



They didn't talk, just nibbled and sipped their drinks. They were waiting for their nerves to wind down. Then Lena took out the cellphone and looked at it more intensely. She studied the pictures, trying to figure out what the hi-tech equipment was for. Doug had no idea, either.



The TV blared to life. Both Lena and Doug were startled. Neither had turned on the TV. A face appeared on the screen, one Lena knew well. It was Marcus, the head of security at OS.



""Lena, Doug. Did you get the info on the shipment for \*Blackstar\*?"" inquired Marcus. 



Lena looked at the image of Marcus and asked, ""How did you find us?""



""Simple,"" replied Marcus, ""I homed in on your trackers."" Trackers, plural. Marcus was lying. Doug was freelance, not OS. He had no tracker. Lena cursed in her mind. Marcus was a double agent, more than likely working for \*Blackstar\*. 



Doug knew that Marcus was lying. He gave Lena a slight nod to Lena that he knew. Marcus didn't notice the nod or simply did not care. He wanted what was on that cellphone.



""A car is waiting outside to take both of you to a helipad. I will be waiting for you."" Marcus cut the transmission, and the screen went dark. Doug pulled out a notepad, wrote - bugs. Lena understood the meaning. The room was being watched, and their conversation was being listened to.



Out loud, Doug said, ""You heard the man. Let's not keep him waiting."" ""Right.""



Both stood up, ready to leave. Doug went over to the bar. He grabbed two small flasks filled with whiskey. Then grabbed some snacks. He put the snacks and the flasks in his pockets. He had a feeling they were going to need them later.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Chicago Cubs vs. Tampa Bay Rays: A Low-Scoring Laugher with a Parlay Twist**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

The Chicago Cubs (83-63) and Tampa Bay Rays (72-74) collide at Wrigley Field on September 13, 2025, in a matchup that‚Äôs less ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù and more ‚Äúcontrolled nap.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break down why this game is a goldmine for same-game parlays, sprinkled with the kind of humor that won‚Äôt cost you an extra run.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: The Math Doesn‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)

The Cubs are -185 favorites on the moneyline, implying a 65% chance to win. The Rays (+160) are the scrappy underdogs, but their 4.94 ERA and 3.3 walks per 9 innings from starter Shane Baz make them more ‚Äúscrappy‚Äù than ‚Äúthreatening.‚Äù

**Pitching Matchup:**

* **Matthew Boyd (Cubs):** A 2.92 ERA and 1.06 WHIP? That‚Äôs like a librarian in a library of chaos‚Äîorderly, reliable, and unbothered by the Rays‚Äô .403 slugging percentage.
* **Shane Baz (Rays):** His 4.94 ERA and 9.5 K/9 are impressive‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre into ‚Äúhigh strikeout, high drama‚Äù acts. But with 3.3 walks per game? He‚Äôs the guy who spills coffee on his date three times but still gets a second chance.

**Offense:**  
The Cubs slug .425 (8th in MLB), while the Rays‚Äô .403 (13th) is about as explosive as a wet firework. Their combined total of 8.5 runs? A generous estimate if both teams forget how to swing a bat.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Updates, and Absurdity

No major injuries here, but let‚Äôs lean into the absurd:

* **Shane Baz‚Äôs Walks:** Baz‚Äôs 3.3 BB/9 is enough to make you question if he‚Äôs secretly a yoga instructor who forgot to breathe during his last session.
* **Cubs‚Äô Power Hitters:** Pete Crow-Armstrong‚Äôs 28 HRs are like a jackhammer in a library‚Äîimpressive, but out o

I broke up with him because of his narcissistic tendencies, emotional blackmail, and his refusal to see or acknowledge the pressure he was putting on me and his lack of desire, ability, or willingness to change. This is not even mentioning the behavioral problems, verbal abuse, and lack of intimacy and attraction on my end.

I gave him two opportunities to talk and ask questions. The first when the actual split happen and several weeks later we met for coffee and I let him say his piece and again let him ask me any questions.

However, he is still saying I gave him no closure and he cannot move on without it.

But to be honest I do not know what he wants. I don't want to be cruel and point out all of the ways in which he let me down and hurt me and damaged me.

1nfpf56,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenOver40/comments/1nfpf56/how_do_you_actually_make_and_keep_friends/,How do you actually make - and keep! - friends??,"Sorry its long.

42F married with school age kids. There have been loads of posts about making friends at this age (or any age), and everyone always replies with the same thing - suggestions of where to \*meet\* people. Join hobby groups, volunteer, take classes etc etc.

I don't have an issue with meeting people. In fact, by now I've probably met a good portion of 'eligible' women my age in my town that had the potential to be friends - moms at school, kids activities, various womens groups etc.

That said, in over ten years of living here I'm still pretty much down to like, one actual good friend. And maybe three others who are slightly closer acquaintances at best.

The rest, I call it being 'acquaintance zoned'. We might meet and chat a few times at first, and then it becomes obvious they're not interested in further friendship (and sometimes I'm not interested, but as I've gotten to a 'beggars cant be choosers' level of being desperate for some more company, I'm much more tolerant to most anything; it's much more often that it's the other person). And we end up relegated to the smile hi and wave, how are you how was your summer type of convo when we run into each other at the grocery store, and that's it.

I don't understand why and I don't know how to break past it. I've always had issues making friends, since literal daycare, and I'm possibly neurodivergent, maybe high functioning on the spectrum. That said, I mask \*hard\*. I am. a people pleaser, I'm into psychology, I've studied other women all my life like another species and tried to adapt things I admired. I don't think I do anything that's wildly anti social. I'm not a blunt or 'no filter' person, in fact the opposite- I probably have \*too\* much filter and I end up overthinking everything I say. I watch for social cues like a hawk and try to mirror and match the other person's energy, i try to ask questions, I am average looking but very put together and dress appropriately etc etc, like there's nothing blatant about me, i don't think, that would immediately put people off.

The only real thing I notice is that I do frequently go into slight blank brain mode and have trouble keeping up conversation. I can usually easily do a first hour or two of small talk, finding out basic info about each other and such; but past that, I often falter on what to talk or ask about and often end up with awkward silences. So I don't know - maybe I'm just boring people to death? I also tend to be, i don't know, I guess less expressive than most women. My tone is a bit low/ flat, even when I try to add more emotion into it it sounds fake, whether as most women just do all these exclamations, giggles, squeals all these things that dont feel natural to me. I have trouble emoting with my face too, I even see it in selfies - I'll have these sort of sad deer in the headlights eyes in most photos even though I dont feel sad, and when I smile I feel its what people describe as 'smile that doesn't reach the eyes' - I don't know why. I've been asked why am I so sad since preschool (I wasn't). It's just my face/ expression and I can't control it, so I dont know if thats what's putting people off.

I find most meetings, even with women who made posts claiming they are looking for friends, fizzle out after one or two meetings. And often people I just meet and try to make conversation with and hope maybe it'll lead to a bit of closer interaction, they just seem so entirely disinterested, like their eyes just glaze over. I've tried initiating closer contact so many times - with my kids friends moms, I've hosted or suggested playdates so many times and never been reciprocated, I would ask them questions about themselves and they answered but didnt seem to care to ask me anything back. I've invited couples for dinner and never got a return invite. Recently I've joined a dance class and the women seemed nice, we chatted as a group after class, there's a coffee shop across the street so one day I said I'm going to grab a coffee after class if anyone wants to join me, and they all politely said they need to leave etc. Which, fine, it could've been true. But, now I feel I've used up my 'chance' and i can't do it again without looking weirdly desperate. I've experienced the same before with trying to initiate anything, usually I can only suggest once or twice at most and then if they say they can't or whatever, the ball should be in their court but they never do it and I don't want to keep pestering them if they're obviously not interested.

I'm just lost at this point and have more or less given up on putting myself out there and facing repeated rejection and ghosting and embarrassment because everyone already seems to have their circle of girlfriends to do brunch and girl trips with and doesn't seem to need more, or at least me in it. I pretty much only have my husband, kids, mom and sister for a social network and it's sad. I am pretty comfortable with just my own company to be fair and I'm almost never bored, I'm happy staying home or doing things on my own - but every once in a while, especially seeing other pictures etc, it does get to me and I wish I had more fun female interactions, someone to do these outings or girl trips with, be invited to parties etc. My youngest's social life also suffers because of it, he has friends at school but nailing them down for playdates like he wants is almost impossible because they spend all their time with kids whose moms are friends with their moms..and when I do offer to host, they never reciprocate and he gets sad about it. My husband is not social at all and doesn't care to be, so it all falls on me and couple/ family friends are even more impossible; so we dont get to have the fun experiences like others of summer cookouts, going camping together with other families, halloween parties and all these things that everyone else seems to have so effortlessly.

I've even tried looking for a social skills coach for adults who could assess and tell me what it is I'm doing wrong in my interactions, but wasn't able to find anyone.

I just got some new clothes so I absolutely want to feel like a baddie inside and out.

First of all, do sock curls work on thick hair with layers? I have thick just below shoulder straightish wavy hair. I also have bangs, what should I do with those?

I am also showering tonight. What do you guys think of the Monday repair shampoo and conditioner? I currently don't have any hair masks unfortunately. 

For skincare, I have the mighty patch pimple patches, the ordinary face wash, one kind of turns into an oil and the other turns into a watery one. One comes in the clear set (or clean set? Something like that) and the other comes in the set that has a bunch of serums (hyloronic, and niacinamide are included). I also have hyloronic acid, niacinamide + zinc, the one with coffee in it to brighten dark circles, and moisturizers. 
I also have the glycolic acid exfoliator.

As for makeup, I don't think I need any help on that. Tips are welcome though!

Like, real question: am I IN A SIMULATION? Because today, I spent half an hour clicking captchas and ‚Äì wait for it ‚Äì **GETTING PAID**. Before you lol and move on, let me hit you with a question:

How many captchas have you clicked today that paid you... absolutely NOTHING?

But here I am, following a TikTok rabbit hole, and suddenly there‚Äôs this whole subculture of ""app testing gateways"" where people claim you can just‚Ä¶ test apps, click some captchas, and walk away with actual cash, not just internet points. I mean, what?

So I had to try it, because--honestly--if someone can pay me for what I already do 20 times a day, SIGN ME UP. Here‚Äôs the wild part: it does exist, and a bunch of testers seem obsessed with **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**. 

Here's the breakdown of the typical ‚Äúget paid to click captchas‚Äù pitch:

- Find a portal (everyone‚Äôs talking about **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**)
- Sign up and get matched with ‚Äúapp test‚Äù tasks (we‚Äôre not talking full-on user research, but weirdly basic stuff)
- Click captchas as part of the anti-bot flow, then submit ‚Äúproof‚Äù that you‚Äôre not a robot (lol, because maybe‚Ä¶?)
- They log your clicks and, apparently, pay micro-amounts per task

Okay - sounds chill, but here‚Äôs my **SHOCKING FINDINGS** after digging in:

- Some people are reporting a steady trickle of small payments. As in, if you‚Äôre bored for 30 min with nothing but a phone, it legit adds up.
- Others? Total skepticism. They call it ‚Äúclickfarms with an extra skincare step.‚Äù 
- The legit ones (and YES - **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** ranks here) always let you cash out with *something* (PayPal, gift cards, cryptocoins, you name it).
- These microtasks CAN involve more than captchas‚Äîthink, ‚ÄúIs this app button broken?‚Äù tests, or even accidental beta access to unreleased features.
 
Just typing this, I can‚Äôt help thinking‚Ä¶ If testing gateways can throw money at you for these tasks, WHO is on the other side needing *millions* of real humans to click ‚ÄúI am not a robot‚Äù? Like, is there a secret global race to outsmart AI by hiring actual people to prove their own humanity?

Want my two-cents? Do your research, but if you‚Äôre gonna click captchas regardless, better to do it for cash than nada. But PLEASE be smart: don‚Äôt throw your private info around and NEVER pay to ‚Äúprove your identity.‚Äù The real ones (again, testing example: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**) will never demand up-front payments.

Real talk: has anyone here gotten more than a few dollars for this? Did you get a huge payout‚Äîtell me, am I being secretly hustled out of my next coffee money or did you unlock some magical app-test infinity stone? Drop your wild stories, giant fails, or secret tips below. I‚Äôm absolutely gobsmacked at the idea that in 2024, people are paying you to be human.

So‚Ä¶ are you?

Or am I dreaming with my eyes open, courtesy of **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** and its crazy captcha side hustles?",1,1757741340.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False

1nfp41x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nfp41x/why_does_making_her_your_entire_world_often_lead/,Why does making her your entire world often lead to her leaving?,"Hey everyone, throwaway for obvious reasons. I (50M) just got broken up with by my girlfriend (48F) of two years, and I'm completely heartbroken and confused. I'm trying to make sense of it and would appreciate some outside perspective, especially from women.

I loved this woman with everything I had. She was my absolute priority. My world literally started to revolve around making her happy. I'd:

¬∑ Remember her favorite coffee order and surprise her with it.
¬∑ Always plan dates I knew she'd love.
¬∑ Drop what I was doing if she had a bad day to go comfort her.
¬∑ Constantly text her good morning, throughout the day, and good night.
¬∑ Prioritize her needs and wants over my friends' and even my own hobbies.

I thought I was being the perfect, attentive boyfriend. I wasn't controlling or jealous; I just adored her and wanted to show it every single day.

When she broke up with me, she said she felt ""suffocated."" She called me ""clingy"" and said she felt like she couldn't breathe. She said she lost attraction because it felt like I had ""no life of my own"" and that my constant need to please her was exhausting.

I'm devastated. How can effort and love be seen as a negative? How did being a dedicated partner backfire so badly?

I'm not a perfect guy, but my intention was only to love and support her. Has anyone else experienced this? For the women here, can you help me understand this perspective? Why is intense, focused love sometimes perceived as a turn-off instead of something cherished?

PS : I was deeply in love and showed it by making my girlfriend the center of my world. She broke up with me for being ""clingy"" and ""suffocating."" Why does this happen?

1nfp3gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nfp3gm/i_work_alone_in_a_mall/,I Work Alone In a Mall,"The first thing everyone needs to know is that my therapist is the only reason I'm doing this. Having a diagnosis for clinical depression means you get a therapist. Wasn't like I could afford it, I'd just gotten laid off. So when I found a job listing on LinkedIn for a night guard position at a mall, I took it. Totally not like I was forced to, *thanks Dr. Carter.* I needed a reason to get out of bed every day anyway, and I was a night owl as well. 

I got hired without an interview, which told me that they were desperate, and pulled up at around noon. Strangely, there was no one in the parking lot. It was fairly out in the sticks too, twenty or so miles out of the city. Nothing else was around. No buildings, just trees, and a road. What was even stranger was the guy who was to be my boss. An old man he was, heavy bags under his eyes, which were bug like and dark, his shoulders were slumped down, like he had held the weight of the world, and crumbled. 

He was holding a belt and clear plastic bag with a uniform. Looked to be around my size, like a Paul Blart lite. His voice was also strange, like a stone dragging against steel. ""Hey there, you Anderson?"" His eyes bored into mine as he asked the question, like he was trying to stare right into my soul, it felt like he was succeeding. 

""Yeah, you Brandon?"" He nodded in response and grunted as he turned toward the towering building. Now that I was really looking at the mall itself, it looked strange, like a mix of different architectural styles. I recognized a few of them. Gothic, a few Athenian pillars were arranged out front. The fourth floor was a weird Roman style. There was a kind of Persian dome on the top. I assumed from the look of it it was made of stained glass.

Brandon groped for a ring of keys on his belt, arthritic fingers bulging slightly, and unlocked the front door. Why was the main door of a mall locked at noon on a Tuesday? ""So, are there any other guards?"" Brandon peered over his ice slope of a shoulder, his eyes fixed on mine as he answered bluntly.

""No."" That was... somehow not as strange as I thought it would be. ""Why not?"" He pushed the door open and held it for me, before bustling ahead like a stickbug. **""**Only need one."" I didn't mind the short answers, I wasn't in the mood to talk much anyway. I kept masking. Something Dr. Carter told me to stop doing. The guard office was on the second floor, it was a small room. There was a mini fridge, coffee brewer, a leather sofa, desk with many monitors on it, complete with a chair that swivels, and a sun bleached poster of a cat that said *""hang in there!""*

Brandon tossed the uniform at me, along with a belt and key ring. ""Stay here till I get back, until then, do not turn on the monitors. Just change into the uniform."" I raised my eyebrow at him and he shrugged me off, walking out of he office. After checking the room for cameras all around the room, to the point of sticking my fingers in the slits of the vent in the room. I changed as quickly as possible. I still felt like something was right behind me, watching me. didn't have a radio, and there wasn't any kind of pepper spray, but there was a small cross embroidered on the inside of the collar. I pulled my wallet, phone, and small baggie of pills from my pockets.

Downside of it not being socially acceptable to have a purse, and too lazy to deal with a bag anyway, I usually kept my antidepressants in a baggie. Felt a bit rebellious to keep it in a way that felt nefarious. One of the few things that wasn't drowned in the sea of depression. 

Right as I popped a pill, Brandon came back in, carrying another key ring. He stared as the bag disappeared into my pocket. ""Those illicit?"" His voice sounded both apprehensive and slightly hopeful. ""Nope, antidepressants."" He grunted again before tossing me the key ring he had. I looked down at it, there were tags attached to the keys, *B4*, *B5*, *B6*, all the way till *B9*. and a couple that said *maintenance, bathrooms,* and *emergency.* The emergency tag was bright red with yellow lettering. 

""The key ring I just gave you has keys to the elevators, employee bathrooms, and the five maintenance rooms across the buildings, all the maintenance rooms have breaker boxes that control the section's lights and appliances. As well as valves to the fire sprinkler system and the ventilation system. All the systems are closed off in case of failure. The emergency key goes into a lock at the end of the hallway on the ninth subfloor. Only use it for *emergencies,* life or death situations. The key ring I gave you at the entrance to the building has keys to all the other doors around the building.""

He showed me around the building, the three food courts, departments, empty slots that were filled with couches and tables, where the vending machine with the best snacks is, all with the exception of the subfloors. Gave him the heeby Jeebies, he said. Strange coming from such a gruff man.

When we were walking through the last food court, there was a sudden screeching coming from the sandwich place, it was sharp and piercing, like the wail of a woman pitched upward until it was a continuous needle in my ears. There were crashes and additional screams coming from the kitchen behind it. When it stopped, I realized that Brandon was walking toward me from the little place. There was peanut butter on his sleeve.

On our way out he showed me one of the maintenance rooms. ""Remember, in case something happens, or something fails, you'll have four other sectors where there's power and running water. Sometimes things make their way into the air vents, and you'll have to clear them. So you'll just hit these two buttons here and twist this knob..."" 

He showed me how to clear the vents, when he did it, there was a thunderous thumping coming from the inside, which slowly got quieter. He also showed me how to read the gauges to tell how close the breakers were from failing. 

""There are some things you'll want to see, so keep the lights on, but there are also things you might not wanna see, in that case, turn as many light off as you can, in the event the breakers in the section you're in flip, and the lights go out, be careful. The things you don't wanna see won't get at ya, but the things you'd wanna see. Those can and will.""

I did *not* like that warning. He was an old man, so it was possible that he was just being senile. But the fact that he appeared completely serious and present in the moment... unnerved me. 

On the way to the elevator that went to the subfloors, there was a faint pattering. All of a sudden Brandon covered my eyes with his swollen fingers, reaching for a nearby switch that plunged us into absolute darkness.

""What the he-!"" I started out before it was bit off by Brandon clamping his hand tighter over my mouth, his raspy voice found it's whispered way to my ear, ""Don't move, don't acknowledge."" The moment the words left his lips, I felt *something* behind me. I could hear the meaty slap of bare flesh against the smooth concrete. I felt warm breath on my neck, but as i made to turn, I felt Brandon grip my arms tight.

Relenting, I stayed in place for what felt like an agonizingly long time, when we heard the scuttling fade away, the lights snapped back on, blinding me. ""When you hear something like that running at you, you turn off the light if you can, if you can't, cover your eyes, curl up, and don't move. Understand?"" I reluctantly nodded, letting the questions and accusations die in my dry throat.

We walked from the hallway to the front doors. The elevator forgotten. ""See you Thursday, right? That's when my first shift is?"" He stared at me, ""Yep, it'll be a kind of evaluation, When your shift is over, I'll come to check it out, and if you pass. You'll start seeing more shifts. Lucky for you, since you're the only other employee, you'll be getting around fifty an hour. and with seven P.M to four A.M shifts every day of the work week, you'll be raking in the money.""

I'm a 33 year old guy who's going through some relationship turmoil right now. It'd be cool to have someone to talk to about it, but it absolutely doesn't have to be the primary focus. I'm local to the Seattle area and need some reasons to get out of the house besides work. I'm a little awkward in person, but once I feel comfortable, I'm an open book. I'm trying to work on getting in better shape, so a gym or hiking or walking buddy would be great. For full disclosure - I identify as a transgender man and would love to meet some fellow queer folks.

Interests of mine are exploring the pacific northwest and seeing new places, food, drinks, coffee, arcades, video games, music, dogs, mythology and lots more, very open minded and into learning about and trying new things.

I don't care about gender, I'm only looking for friends right now. Online is fine with me, but local folks are preferred.

‚∏ª

Name: Patrick Bateman
Occupation: Vice President, Mergers and Acquisitions, Pierce & Pierce
Location: Manhattan, Upper West Side
Age: 27
Annual Salary: ~$250,000
Relationship Status: Engaged. Technically.
Mortgage: $5230 + 1,250 HOA
Investments: ~$960,000 across index funds, biotech, art-backed lending platforms, and something called ‚Äúcarbon-neutral wine futures.‚Äù Don‚Äôt ask. I won‚Äôt explain.


Let‚Äôs talk about money: 


What‚Äôs a formative experience you had with money as a child?
When I was seven, I told my father I wanted to buy a jet. He said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not ambitious. Owning the company that builds them is.‚Äù
Later that year, I traded my cousin‚Äôs Rolex for a pocketknife and never regretted it. That was the first time I understood that value is perception. And that perception can be manipulated.


Did your parents expect you to go to college?
It wasn‚Äôt an expectation. It was a requirement‚Äîlike table manners or hiding your contempt for the help.
I went to Phillips Exeter, then Harvard, then Harvard Business. At no point was ‚Äúchoice‚Äù discussed. It was simply the sequence.


Do you feel financially secure?
Yes. And if I didn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd just remove whoever made me feel that way.

‚∏ª

DAY ONE ‚Äì MONDAY

7:00 AM ‚Äì Wake. 1,000 crunches. Deep pore cleansing lotion. A mint facial mask, then a dermal rehydrating toner. I apply it in smooth, upward strokes. If you don‚Äôt take care of your skin, you might as well be dead. Or worse‚Äîmiddle class.
Breakfast: Egg whites. No toast. Cold-brewed coffee in a Baccarat glass.
Commute: Town car. No subway. Never. $48.

12:30 PM ‚Äì Lunch at Le Bernardin with Luis Carruthers. He smells like desperation and Brut cologne. I order monkfish and pretend to listen. $214.

6:00 PM ‚Äì Dinner alone at Pastis. A waitress compliments my tie. I make a note to never return. $146.

Total: $408

‚∏ª

DAY TWO ‚Äì TUESDAY

6:15 AM ‚Äì Morning jog. Central Park. Someone coughs too close to me. I run faster.

9:00 AM ‚Äì I arrive at the office. The receptionist says good morning. I don‚Äôt respond.

12:45 PM ‚Äì Paul Owen brags about his reservations at Dorsia. I fantasize about removing his face with a letter opener. Instead, I order a Cobb salad. $19.

3:00 PM ‚Äì Purchase a limited-run Issey Miyake fragrance. It smells like sterile wealth and powdered ego. $300.

8:00 PM ‚Äì Drinks with McDermott and Van Patten. I nod as they speak. Inside, I‚Äôm thinking about the hollow geometry of their skulls. $220.

Total: $539

‚∏ª

DAY THREE ‚Äì WEDNESDAY (THE MURDER)

7:30 AM ‚Äì Routine: Exfoliate. Mask. Tone. Moisturize. Deodorant without alcohol, because alcohol dries your skin and makes you look like you feel.

11:00 AM ‚Äì Lunch with Paul Owen. I compliment his business card. It‚Äôs off-white with a tasteful watermark. Revolting.

2:00 PM ‚Äì He thinks we‚Äôre going to Dorsia. We are not.

7:00 PM ‚Äì His apartment. Music: Huey Lewis and the News. I go into an impromptu monologue about ‚ÄúHip to Be Square.‚Äù He laughs. Then screams.

7:09 PM ‚Äì I kill Paul Owen with a chrome axe from Restoration Hardware. It takes three swings. He dies dumb and rich. He dies believing he had reservations.

7:15 PM ‚Äì I shower. Change clothes. Wipe down the scene.

7:30 PM ‚Äì I sit on his couch. Take a breath. Open my wallet.
From it, I remove a single square of 86% dark chocolate, wrapped in black foil.
I let it melt in my mouth. The bitterness is perfect.
It is the first thing I‚Äôve tasted all day.
$3

9:00 PM ‚Äì Dry-cleaning drop. Cash only. No receipt. $280.

Total: $283

‚∏ª

DAY FOUR ‚Äì THURSDAY

6:00 AM ‚Äì Wake. Dreamed of blood on marble. Smile reflexively.

10:00 AM ‚Äì Morning meeting. Pretend to care. Cross my legs. My socks are Gucci.

12:30 PM ‚Äì Lunch: Pan-seared halibut and a fennel salad. I tip 12% just to test myself. $92.

2:00 PM ‚Äì Buy a magazine I won‚Äôt read. Artforum. It‚Äôs all ads anyway. $18.

6:00 PM ‚Äì Dinner at Cipriani with Evelyn. She tells me she‚Äôs thinking of becoming vegan. I consider ending the relationship with a fork. $260.

Total: $370

‚∏ª

DAY FIVE ‚Äì FRIDAY

7:15 AM ‚Äì Crunches. Cucumber toner. No thoughts. Just definition.

9:30 AM ‚Äì Office. I draw the same square over and over on a legal pad. It has to be perfect.

12:00 PM ‚Äì Martini lunch. One oyster. Two olives. $128.

3:00 PM ‚Äì Walk into Prada, buy shoes I already own. $780.

9:00 PM ‚Äì Club. Loud. Flashing. Everyone‚Äôs sweating, screaming, pretending. It‚Äôs hell with better lighting. $540.

Total: $1,448

‚∏ª

DAY SIX ‚Äì SATURDAY

10:00 AM ‚Äì I wake up on thousand-thread-count sheets I don‚Äôt remember falling asleep in. That‚Äôs how you know you‚Äôre rich.

11:00 AM ‚Äì Brunch at Balthazar. I pretend the croissant is made from the soul of someone I hate. $73.

2:00 PM ‚Äì Art gallery. Buy a piece described as ‚Äúpost-human nihilism in mixed media.‚Äù It‚Äôs just an empty frame. $9,000.

8:00 PM ‚Äì Dinner alone. Kobe beef. Aged sake. I tip in exact change. $210.

Total: $9,283

‚∏ª

DAY SEVEN ‚Äì SUNDAY

10:30 AM ‚Äì I sit on my balcony. It‚Äôs quiet. Manhattan tries to rest. I don‚Äôt.

11:00 AM ‚Äì Protein shake. No chocolate. That was Wednesday. That was‚Ä¶ ritual.

3:00 PM ‚Äì I polish my knives. Not out of necessity. Out of reverence.

6:30 PM ‚Äì Sushi delivery. I order the exact same thing Paul Owen used to get.
A tribute. Or a joke. I‚Äôm not sure. $68.

Total: $68

‚∏ª

WEEKLY TOTAL: $12,399

‚∏ª

Final Thoughts:
I only ate one square of dark chocolate this week.
I ate it after I killed a man.
It was the best thing I tasted.
Not because of the chocolate.
Because there was nothing left to prove.

- Is it the fleeting nature that makes it precious, or the impact it leaves behind?
- We often race through life, chasing after the next milestone, but do we stop to appreciate the moments in between?
- Moments can be like grains of sand slipping through the hourglass of time, each one unique and irreplaceable.
- Think back to a moment that holds special meaning to you‚Äîwas it the grand gestures or the quiet whispers that made it unforgettable?

In a world fixated on productivity and progress, we can easily overlook the significance of small, seemingly insignificant moments.

-  What if we started valuing the moments where nothing seems to be happening?
- The quiet morning coffee, the stolen glance with a loved one, the sound of rain tapping gently on the window.
- These are the moments that enrich our lives in ways we might not immediately recognize.
-  Perhaps the essence of a fulfilled life lies not in the grand achievements but in the sum of these precious, seemingly unremarkable moments.

We often hear people say, ""Life is made up of moments,"" but how often do we pause and truly let that sink in?

- A moment can be a spark of inspiration, a touch of kindness, a shared laugh.
- It can also be a dagger of pain, a wave of sadness, a bitter taste of regret.
- No matter its form, a moment has the power to shape our experiences and perceptions.
- What if we learned to embrace each moment, without judgment or expectation, simply as it is?

As we navigate the chaotic waters of life, let us not forget the profound impact of the tiniest moments.

- Each moment is a piece of the mosaic that is our existence, contributing to the masterpiece of our collective experience.
- The next time you find yourself rushing through life's motions, take a moment to pause, breathe, and truly be present.
- The value of a moment is not measured by",1,1757739913.0,magicalignment,0,1.0,False

This whole damn thing with Charlie kirk is sending me over the edge fr. The man had hardly hit the pavement when the right wing nutjobs were already screaming for the heads of all trans people. Not an ounce of professionalism from any single rightist official. One even openly slinging transphobia slurs as casually as ordering a coffee. News outlets already calling for our heads, feeding off unsubstantiated reports from unreliable sources. The entire right calling for vengeance against us. And then the whiplash happens. Officially the murderer in custody. And what a fucking shock, it's a young white, cis man from an all christan republican magat family. And suddenly it's prayers for his soul, pray he finds rhe light, more and more hypocritical dribble. No I'm not surprised, not in the slightest. But I'm reaching my breaking point watching this exact scenario play out over and over and over again. I'm sickened. I'm tired of my existence being a political propaganda pawn. I'm tired of my existence being politicized. Maybe it's because I'm autistic but there's a few things I hate more than anything, I hate being blamed for something I didn't do, I hate hypocrisy, and I despise willful ignorance. The mass incident statistics are widely known, widely available. They're not a secret. And the whole right is entirely ignoring it. Trans people are statistically basically the least likely demographic to perform acts of violence. And yest the heads of this party have whipped every brain dead cultist sheep into blaming us which is going to incite more and more violence towards us. Like.... All I fucking want, all I've ever wanted, was to live a quiet, peaceful, comfortable life. I don't have it in me to hurt someone much less kill them. Even in a self defense situation I'd be more likely to run than fight if I'm being honest with myself. I'm just..... I'm tired. I'm scared for myself and my family. If I had the means I'd already be long gone from this dystopian ass country. I never before had the intentions of being stealth, I'm proud of my trans identity. It took a long time to learn and accept myself, and just when I find that inner peace the world turns against me again. But now I have a full blown panic attack if I even consider leaving the house when not binding. I'm tired. I'm fucking exhausted. I'm so over being hyperventilate. I hate that I see people and public and fearing they'd try to hurt me if they knew I was trans. I can't even afford to get my name and gender marker changed rn and I panic whenever I have to provide my ID. AND I LIVE IN A BLUE CITY. I just. I'm screaming into the void before I fully self destruct. I stg. I don't ask for much, I just want this to be over. Now I'm gonna go have myself a cry and gorge myself on Icecream.

1nfofkb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nfofkb,AIO for labeling my ex gf ‚Äúavoidant‚Äù after she has been leading me on our whole relationship?,"

I (m24) started dating this girl (f20) around january of this year after we met in the beginning of 2024 and prior to actually getting together, she was fairly flirty and friendly until I actually asked her out. The first few weeks was probably the happiest I had been but after those few weeks, she did become distant and although I could still feel that she liked me, I didn‚Äôt feel like she was interested in me and to truly put it into perspective, we literally dated for 7 months and had sex maybe twice. We did hang out plenty but it felt like we were only friends which saddened me. Imo she didn‚Äôt put in as much effort as I did to see her but it‚Äôs not like she ever refused me, she happily agreed to seeing me whenever I asked (we go to the same uni but she dorms while I don‚Äôt so it wasn‚Äôt like it was a burden to come and meet me anyway since it was so easy to). There was a time where I‚Äôm 70% sure a girl had liked me so I told her about it and to my surprise, she was not jealous, and it KIND OF felt like she wanted me to respond to the girl which of course I didn‚Äôt.

For 2 months, she had been painfully inconsistent and we texted less and hung out less, I even confronted her about it and she apologized then picked her act back up briefly before doing it again a few weeks later. She gives me TONS of excuses and I cannot tell whether she‚Äôs lying or not because she is one of the kindest people I‚Äôve ever met, she‚Äôs super pretty, very smart, very goal oriented and extremely likable that it‚Äôs a bit overwhelming how surrounded she is by others. The type of person she is makes it hard for me to judge her and assume she has some type of ulterior motive or intention to hurt me. We broke up about 2ish months ago because I was getting exhausted from the one sided relationship and she ended up crying so we talked for a few hours over coffee then she asked if we could still be friends and I agreed because I had no reason not to and the relationship felt like we were only friends anyway. Since then, she now feels like an actual girlfriend way more than when we were ACTUALLY dating which is really confusing to me. I regretted breaking up with her, so naturally I got close with her again but whenever I bring up anything related to dating at all or our relationship, she doesn‚Äôt engage at all so I was getting the hint that maybe she didn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship. But nearly a month ago there was this girl I started to talk to who apparently was a friend of a friend of hers and someone told her about me and that girl. She asked me if I was talking to her and I said yes. This week on wednesday she asked to get back together. I told one of my friends about this and he suggested maybe she had avoidant personality disorder and regretfully, I asked her if she did and she did not react the brightest to it. I don‚Äôt know if this was the wrong thing to do and if I reacted appropriately. I‚Äôm thinking of apologizing, not sure how but I could also be blind by love so please tell me AIO",3,1757738326.0,AmIOverreacting,7,1.0,False

Hey, fellow content creators and cash stackers! üôå I hope everyone is vibing with those creative juices flowing because today, we‚Äôre diving into something *juicy* ‚Äì faceless growth strategies that are crushing it right now! 

Let‚Äôs be real: not everyone wants to be the face of their brand, and that's *totally* okay. Whether you're camera-shy, an introvert, or just prefer to let your work do the talking, there are PLENTY of ways to grow your income without stepping into the spotlight. üåü

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs *working* this month when it comes to faceless growth:

1. **Content Automation**: 
   - Work smarter, not harder, am I right? Use tools like **DS24** (shout-out to the helpful guide ‚Äì check it out [here](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/)) to automate your content creation. Set it, forget it, and watch the cash flow in while you binge-watch that show you've been meaning to catch up on. No face required!

2. **Niche Down**: 
   - Picking a specific niche can feel scary but think of it as *harnessing your superpower*. Focus on what you love, but also what people are searching for (hello, keyword research!). This helps you become the *go-to* source without ever having to show your dazzling smile. 

3. **Affiliate Marketing Magic**: 
   - Encourage others to showcase your products without showcasing yourself! Partner with influencers or mood board creators who align with your values. You get exposure, they get your stuff, and you both get a slice of that sweet commission pie. üç∞

4. **Engagement Through AI and Chatbots**: 
   - Who needs face-to-face contact when you can have helpful chatbots? Automate your social interactions and keep that conversation flowing 24/7. Your audience will feel heard without you losing your sanity!

5. **Leverage User-Generated Content**: 
   - Encourage your customers to share their experience with your product ‚Äì their faces can be the stars of the show! Structure campaigns or contests that highlight their work, and boom, you‚Äôve got yourself a marketing strategy without ever having to step near a camera.

And for those of you still doubting your faceless potential, remember this: Being behind the scenes doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt shine. It‚Äôs all about how you package your expertise and let your content sing. üé§ 

Oh! And let‚Äôs not forget the biggest perk of faceless growth ‚Äì **more time and energy for the things you love**. You have room to explore new ventures, pick up hobbies, or just enjoy some much-needed relaxation. Because, let‚Äôs face it ‚Äì who doesn‚Äôt want to chill out with a good book and a warm cup of coffee? ‚òï

So, what strategies are you trying this month? Are you team faceless, or are you dabbling in the limelight a bit? Let‚Äôs share our wins and thoughts ‚Äì because together, we stack that cash better! üí™üíµ",1,1757738023.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1nfoa32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmyBradleyIsMissing/comments/1nfoa32/david_carmichaels_sighting/,David Carmichael's Sighting,"David approached the Bradley family in May 1999 after watching America's Most Wanted and Unsolved Mysteries, telling them he had seen Amy in August 1998.

He claims he called the AMW tip line but was never connected to the FBI. So basically we've got this witness who was interviewed by the Bradleys before the FBI had a chance to interview him. He'd already seen two shows - and the AMW show had info about the tattoos.

Assuming he's telling the truth (mostly - we'll get to the watch later), here's what I think happened on the beach in August 1998.

He shouted to his friend. This woman thought he was catcalling her. She stopped to glare at him. Her boyfriend also stopped to glare at him, then he took her arm protectively and they continued to make their way to the cafe. Then they sat in the cafe, that's it.

Maybe she looked over at him from time to time, thinking about nothing or thinking that he's the jerk who catcalled her. But she wasn't Amy. She was just a woman who was sick of being catcalled.

The watch stuff? I'm convinced that no such watch ever existed. In their interviews, neither David nor Ivy mention ""he described her watch"" or even ""he described her jewelry."" Only ""he described her tattoos."" 

I think they needed something more to convince either the public or the FBI that his sighting was real, so they made up the watch. It wasn't until years later they started making their claim that he had seen her Dos Equis watch. In fact, has he ever directly made that claim himself? 

Around 2004-2005 (before David or Iva mentioned that David had identified it) info about her jewelry and watch started appearing on NAMU and the FBI poster. The watch is described as ""silver with a blue face"" and on her right wrist. They said she had a silver bracelet on her left wrist.

Something silver is on her left wrist in the videos of her dancing in the lounge. Nothing is on her right wrist. 

So either they were wrong about either the watch or bracelet, or she went home from the lounge and put on her watch. She doesn't bother to slip on her shoes, but she needs her watch. Okay, maybe this fits with the theory that she planned to meet Alister at 6 am. She sat outside, not falling asleep, waiting until her watch said it was time to go. Maybe it even had a little beep alarm. Then she goes to meet him. But why in the world would she not wear shoes? 

I know that now the Bradleys say that maybe she did wear shoes but that's not what they said at first. Also, who goes to dig out other shoes while sneaking out of the cabin, trying not to wake anybody up? Her sandals were right there. The only possible explanation is that, in case her dad woke up, she wanted to look like she was going to the bathroom. But even that's flimsy because she could've just told him she was going for coffee! (Unless there had been some fight and he didn't want her to leave the room.)

Anyway. There are no photos of her wearing the watch on the cruise. There are no photos of her wearing the watch EVER. Although there are some photos from before the cruise of her wearing a watch with a black leather strap. 

One commenter said maybe that's the watch, and the ""silver"" just applies to the frame around the face. But I think it would be strange to describe the watch as silver with a blue face instead of ""with a black leather strap."" It certainly wouldn't be helpful as a way for people to identify her, since they would be looking for a silver band.

Plus the website shows a photoshopped example with a silver band, and I think the family approves of the website, right? Or at least they would correct it if it were wrong? Who knows?

There's no boyfriend to say ""yes, I gave her the watch."" A commenter pointed out that he worked at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, which is not a place that would sell a lot of Mexican beer, so it's a little odd that he was given a Dos Equis watch. I don't find that so strange, but Dos Equis never made a branded watch. Maybe they made one just for swag and not for sale? But there aren't any on the internet except one that looks very different from the Bradleys' description.

It just seems really weird that there are no photos of her wearing it, especially on the night she went missing when she was supposed to be wearing it. There are other discrepancies with the jewelry, too. She wasn't wearing her class ring and they say she was. The silver bracelet isn't thin (if it's what's on her wrist while she's dancing or it's the same one that appears in other photos of her.) She's wearing a necklace they don't mention.

If you had to identify Amy by the Bradleys' description of her jewelry, you'd never get it right. So it's weird that David did get it right. 

Even if the silver thing she's wearing in the disco is a watch, it's on the wrong wrist. I mean, there's the whole issue with how he could see the watch in that much detail, anyway, but he would've said that it was on the wrong wrist.

This watch isn't real. Maybe David saw someone he actually believes was Amy, but it's a bit sus that the tip line didn't transfer him to the FBI or that, failing that, he didn't just call back until it did. Maybe he never called the tip line? It's also sus that he contacted the Bradleys instead of the FBI. He just seems like yet another scammer. The Bradleys seem like they'll fall for anything and they'll do anything to keep this case alive. The FBI isn't convinced? Invent a Dos Equis watch no one has ever seen. The public lost interest? Invent a Dos Equis watch and see the donations pour in.

Maybe David saw somebody. But that's as far as it goes.

We were together for 1.5 years, living together before he got arrested for probation warrant and was sentenced to a year ‚Äî original offense was non violent and minor but he stopped showing up to his check-in 3 months before the end. 

I was there for him the whole time he was locked up. I stayed loyal. I found myself begging for scraps of attention, for a goodnight phone call. Looking back I realize he was struggling with his own shit but was so focused on me and what I wanted. He broke up with me 2 months before he was released. And it hurt. Bring broken up with by someone locked up made me question my worth. I sent him quite a bit of money for his commissary and phone calls while he was incarcerated. He offered to pay me back but I declined. I never sent it with the expectation of being paid back. 

Before he got locked up he was so attentive. I worked the night shift so he made sure I came home to dinner; he would pack me lunch and would make sure I ate breakfast. I worked more hours so he took care of all the household chores. We would talk for hours. We would slow dance in the living room. It felt like a fantasy. He‚Äôs not a bad person but he has always struggled with emotions. He‚Äôs more of an actions person. And I‚Äôm the opposite. I‚Äôm very emotional. The differences between us were easier to navigate when we were in person. The long distance/ only being able to talk over the phone really fucked things up. 

Now he‚Äôs out. It was almost easier dealing with the breakup while he was locked up. I find myself thinking about him multiple times a day, wondering what he is doing, wanting to talk to him. And not in the sense that I want to get back together‚Äî I know it wouldn‚Äôt be good for either of us. I just want closure. I have questions I want answered. I want the chance to let him know that I don‚Äôt blame him and take accountability for my actions that led to the end of our relationship.

I don‚Äôt have any thyroid issue. I‚Äôm now on Ozempic as my doctor decided to officially diagnose me as type 2 (see my previous post). I‚Äôm also on Sertraline and Ozempic but I don‚Äôt want to be on more medications if I don‚Äôt have to. Especially pills. I hate them and always forget to take them. I‚Äôve tried supplements in the past that work by adding it to my coffee but my hair loss lately has been horrible. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs from being off the glp1 for a couple months that made the shedding extra but this has been slowly happening a few years now. Would you all recommend I go the Nutrfol route or try another medication like  minoxidil or spironolactone? It‚Äôs frustrating having to take all these meds but I also hate going bald and dealing with these PCOS symptoms. There also this one cheaper than Nutrfol but has great ingredients that help with PCOS symptoms:

I also hear sertraline might not mix well with Spironolactone . Anyone else on sertraline and taking Spironolactone? ",1,1757737545.0,PCOS,1,1.0,False

It's a cute rom-com spoof, but I think it goes a bit overboard in how it spoofs some pretty great rom-coms, like When Harry Met Sally and You've Got Mail, which I really like! However, it does have a few classic scenes, like when Amy Poehler orders #3 at the coffee shop, and when they end up trashing her entire living room the first time they have sex.

I don‚Äôt often step outside my comfort zone so when I do it‚Äôs a big deal for me. I see this girl a few times a week at her job. At first our conversations were kind of casual but they‚Äôve been getting more personal over the past few months. We‚Äôve connected over quite a bit and I genuinely thought there might be something there. She recommended a book to me and I asked if she wanted to get coffee and talk about it sometime and she said yes. The last time I was there I gave her my number so we could set something up as she was busy and I was in a rush. It‚Äôs been a few days now and I haven‚Äôt heard from her. I‚Äôm really worried that I went out on a limb and made her uncomfortable which was definitely not my intention. I would take it all back if I could and just go back to the way things were. ,17,1757737291.0,self,19,0.95,False
