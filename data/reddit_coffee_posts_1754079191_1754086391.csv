So I held my arms out to make a bridge and he climbed right on and crossed to the sofa—as if that had been the plan all along. Then sat on my lap for about a minute while I petted him.

**Synopsis:**

Both as a cop and a person, Lieutenant Mel Cruz is consistently dealt a crap hand.  She's a jaded officer coming to terms with the wreckage of her romantic life, a near fatal injury, and an acerbic new captain.  Following her transfer to a new unit, she desperately tries to hold her life together while rebuilding her career.  Oh, and she's a 34-year-old Scouting Officer for the Code Enforcement branch of the Exonet Maintenance Bureau.  To put it in Luddite, she's a cyborg law enforcement officer, and digital systems are her beat.

Follow our protagonist on a journey of healing and found family, as well as terrifying and profound explorations of the nature of humanity and sentience.  Lieutenant Cruz will have to adjust to life in the sticks of the Jovian system, build relationships with her colleagues, and still manage her weekly caseload of digital crimes.  A.I.s and humans alike will feature prominently in a story where the characters must weigh the measure of non-human life.  And behind the innocent facade of this backwater mining port lurks something new and dark that's eating out the heart of Ursa Miner Station.

Be prepared for snark, LGBTQ+ themes, occasional violence, and lots of cyber-everything in a relatively hard sci-fi shell!

For context, my husband and I have been together for almost 12 years and we have three kids (11/F, 9/F, 4/M) together. He’s been a stay at home dad for most of our time since we moved out of state away from family. I lost my mom when I was 18 and my dad to cancer in 2019. Ive been surrounded by death of an ex fiancé (high school sweetheart), pretty much adopted sister, all but one of my grandparents and a few close friends of mine. So I do have my own demons but I’ve been to therapy in the past. My husband has a mom and doesn’t talk to his dad at all and won’t go to therapy. Over the years a lot has happened between us. My husband cheated on me when my dad was dying of cancer and I was with my kids in another state. I chose to forgive him and we had marriage counseling and our vows renewed. Fast forward, a year later and he starts talking to affair partner again around the same time my son was born. She had a child with another baby daddy and just wants to be friends. I am not okay with this since I told him before I would never be able to forgive him if he keeps her around. He agrees to stop talking to her if we get a new car so he feels accomplished. (I’ve been working two jobs and going to school while he works part time here and there. He also goes to school for a license). I quit one of my jobs because I got a promotion so he can still stay at home with the kids. He tells me he sacrificed his career for mine quite often even though he hasn’t finished anything he’s pursued so far. 
He has anger problems but overall he’s a sweet amazing guy who has great humor and the best father to our kids. I think enjoy our bedroom life as well! But he is very judgmental and a complete hypocrite. We both started playing video games and had a really great friend group but my husband likes to start drama and then say that our friends betrayed him. I took my friends side (25/m and 56/m) because I agreed that husband is taking things too personally. I play more with our friends and husband plays with his other rl friend group online. He gets mad because I am putting attention to other male friends and throws me down to the ground and chokes me one night. Then another time, he throws cold coffee at me because I am in discord with same friends. It mostly revolves around 25/M because he has become more like family. We are basically twins when it comes to games and ideas. He’s more of a brother to me than my own blood brother and reminds me of my dead sister and dad. Same humor and vibe. Playing with him and the rest of my friends make me super happy when all I do is work and take care of the house. Husband used to play video games all day and sometimes I would still come home and cook and clean and take care of the kids. And then get on the game. I try to play games with my friends later at night so it doesn’t interfere with my family time with kids and husband. Husband doesn’t think I spent enough time with the kids but I try to take them out and do fun stuff with them and he mostly plays video games with them.
My husband is pissed because I’m still playing with male friends especially the one he hates and thinks I’m investing more time with them than him. I try to plan time with him and go on more dates and play magic with him or play when he gets ready for bed but he stays up late so he goes to bed alone if I decide to play. 
It’s all really stupid because he gets to play games anytime he wants and go play magic and warhammer. I have never told him he couldn’t do anything when it comes to hobbies and encourage him even to do something for himself. But my playing video games with my friends is a problem especially because I work so much and have less time to spend. But it makes me really happy to be apart of something even if it’s game related. Right now it’s star citizen. It’s got enough down time in the game that I also do dishes and make food and do stuff with the kids in between traveling to other planets and whatnot. 
Things havent been going well for us for awhile but the gaming thing really is a problem but it’s something I gave up when I had kids and I miss it a lot. And the friends I met have been absolute life savers. They hate the way my husband talks to me when we all gamed together and think he is abusive towards me. He’s only slapped me once. But the verbal abuse can be bad. I would just really like some advice if I keep forgiving him after the affair, lying to me about talking to affair partner again after he made a promise, and lying to never hurt me but says hurtful things and gets physically abusive? He tells me that I won’t find a man who loves me as much as him and that he is a good guy and whatever he does is wrong. 
I guess in context, he thinks what I am doing is wrong and classified as cheating. I’m literally just playing a game with good friends and having a grand time to destress. Work is stressful and being around my husband is stressful. ",2,1754085940.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

The memory-leak targets the intimate experience millions live daily.. The crushing exhaustion of modern work life.. Revealing how their personal struggle with burnout serves the exact system that creates burnout. It dismantles the narrative that burnout is a workplace problem requiring individual solutions, exposing it as a sophisticated control mechanism that transforms human energy into economic value.

This hits particularly close to home because it attacks the one thing people use to justify their suffering (their work is important, they're making a difference, they're pushing boundaries) and reveals it as systematic exploitation disguised as personal virtue.

# The Sacred Collapse

You believe burnout is a breakdown. You've been told it's a warning sign, a red flag, evidence that you're pushing too hard and need to slow down. But what if burnout isn't a malfunction? What if it's the system working exactly as designed.. A sophisticated mechanism, that transforms your exhaustion into economic productivity while making you grateful for the privilege?

Burnout isn't burnout. It's controlled detonation. The $400+ billion productivity industry didn't create burnout by accident.. They engineered it as the perfect pressure valve that releases just enough steam to keep the machine running without ever questioning why the machine creates so much pressure.

Your exhaustion isn't a bug. It's a feature. You're not burning out.. You're burning as intended, providing fuel for a system that needs your energy depleted in precisely calculated increments.

My feet ached after standing for eight hours at the bookstore, followed by a three-hour evening class at the community college. All I wanted was a hot showe","Chapter 1 - Betrayal and a Masquerade Escape

Hazel's POV

I stumbled through my front door, exhaustion weighing on my shoulders like a heavy blanket. My feet ached after standing for eight hours at the bookstore, followed by a three-hour evening class at the community college. All I wanted was a hot shower and my bed.

Instead, I found my parents waiting in the living room, their expressions grim.

""Hazel, we need to talk,"" my father said, his voice unusually stern.

I dropped my bag by the door. ""Can it wait until morning? I'm dead on my feet.""

""No, it can't,"" Mom replied, holding up a cream-colored envelope. ""This arrived today.""

The fancy gold script made my stomach twist before I could even read it. I already knew what it was.

""Jessica's wedding invitation,"" she announced, as if it were a normal thing to discuss. As if Jessica hadn't destroyed my life less than six months ago.

""That backstabbing witch is not my cousin,"" I snapped, anger immediately replacing my exhaustion.

Dad's face reddened. ""Hazel Marie Vance! That's enough of that language.""

""She slept with Ethan in my bed!"" My voice cracked. ""My boyfriend of four years. In my room, Dad.""

Mom sighed dramatically. ""Ethan was at fault since he was your boyfriend. Jessica was just... confused. He manipulated her.""

I laughed bitterly. ""Confused? Is that what we're calling it? She knew exactly what she was doing.""

""This childish feud needs to end,"" Mom continued, ignoring my pain. ""Your aunt is heartbroken that you've been avoiding family gatherings.""

""I'm sorry my trauma is so inconvenient for everyone,"" I muttered.

Dad stood up, towering over me. ""You're going to this wedding, Hazel. That's final.""

""I'm what?"" I stared at him in disbelief.

""You heard me. Your mother wants peace in the family, and you're going to help make that happen.""

""By watching the man I thought I'd marry walk down the aisle with my cousin?"" My eyes stung with tears. ""Do you have any idea how humiliating that would be?""

Mom's lips thinned into a disapproving line. ""It's been six months. You need to move on.""

""I have moved on! Moving on doesn't mean I need to celebrate their relationship!""

""ENOUGH!"" Dad's shout made me flinch. ""This isn't a debate. You're going to be there with a smile on your face, or you can find somewhere else to live.""

The ultimatum hung in the air between us. I turned and fled to my room, tears streaming down my face. I heard my mother call after me, but I slammed my door, muffling her voice.

I collapsed onto my bed, sobs wracking my body. After everything Ethan and Jessica had done, my parents were still taking their side. The betrayal cut deeper than I thought possible.

""They're making you go to the wedding?"" Chloe's eyes widened in outrage as she slid a coffee across the breakroom table to me. ""That's cruel, even for your parents.""

I'd called her the moment I woke up, and she'd immediately rushed to meet me at work during my break. Chloe had been my best friend since kindergarten, and unlike my family, she'd been fiercely loyal after the Ethan-Jessica disaster.

""Dad threatened to kick me out if I don't go."" I stared into my coffee. ""I can't afford my own place yet.""

""Those self-righteous—"" Chloe cut herself off, her expression suddenly changing. ""Wait. When is this wedding again?""

""Next Saturday,"" I mumbled.

A sly grin spread across her face. ""Perfect. The Sterling Masquerade Ball is the same night.""

""The what?""

""Only the most exclusive event of the year,"" Chloe explained, excitement building in her voice. ""My father got invited through business connections. I have two extra tickets.""

""Chloe, I can't—""

""Yes, you can. Tell your parents it's a networking event for your career. Which isn't even a lie—half the city's business elite will be there.""

""They'll never buy it.""

""Leave that to me."" She squeezed my hand. ""No way are you watching Jessica marry your ex. You're coming to a masquerade ball with me instead.""

Three days later, Chloe had somehow convinced not only my parents but her boyfriend Noah to go along with the plan. She'd spun the ball as a crucial networking opportunity, even getting her father to call mine about the ""professional connections"" I could make.

""See? Problem solved,"" she announced triumphantly as we sat in my bedroom. ""You'll stay at my place Friday night, and we'll get ready together Saturday.""

I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. ""Have I told you lately that you're the best friend ever?""

""Not nearly enough,"" she winked. ""Now we just need to find you something spectacular to wear.""

The night of the ball arrived faster than I expected. Standing in Chloe's bedroom, I hardly recognized the woman in the mirror. My long black hair cascaded down my back in loose waves, and the deep red satin dress hugged my curves perfectly.

""The final touch,"" Chloe whispered, handing me an intricate golden mask that covered the upper half of my face.

I placed it over my eyes, securing the ribbon behind my head. The person staring back at me looked mysterious, confident—nothing like the heartbroken girl who'd been crying herself to sleep for months.

""You look incredible,"" Chloe breathed, adjusting her own silver mask. ""If Ethan could see you now, he'd regret everything.""

Noah knocked on the bedroom door. ""Ladies? The car's waiting.""

As we headed toward the door, panic suddenly gripped my chest. What was I doing? I wasn't the kind of girl who went to lavish parties or defied her parents. What if they found out? What if I ran into someone who knew me?

""Wait,"" I whispered, grabbing Chloe's arm. My heart hammered against my ribs. ""I don't think I can do this.""

""What's wrong?"" Chloe turned to me, concern in her eyes.

""I'm not... I'm not brave like you. Maybe I should just stay here."" The thought of facing a ballroom full of strangers made my stomach twist. ""Please, Chloe, let me stay?""

...

Chapter 2 - A Reckless Encounter

Hazel's POV

""No way, Hazel. I didn't spend three hours making you look like a goddess just so you could hide in my apartment."" Chloe grabbed my shoulders firmly. ""Tonight, you're not going to be the responsible, practical Hazel who always follows the rules. Tonight, you're going to live a little.""

I stared at my reflection one more time, hardly recognizing myself behind the golden mask. My bright green eyes shimmered with nervousness, but also something else—anticipation.

""What if someone recognizes me?"" I whispered.

Noah chuckled from the doorway. ""That's the point of a masquerade, Hazel. No one knows who anyone is.""

""Exactly,"" Chloe nodded triumphantly. ""For one night, you can be whoever you want to be. No ex-boyfriend, no backstabbing cousin, no disappointed parents. Just you, having fun for once in your life.""

Her words hit home. When was the last time I'd actually had fun? Before catching Ethan and Jessica together, probably.

""Fine,"" I conceded, taking a deep breath. ""One night of freedom.""

The Sterling Masquerade Ball was nothing like I'd imagined. The grand ballroom glittered with crystal chandeliers, while masked figures in suits and gowns mingled like characters from a fairy tale. Classical music flowed from a live orchestra, and champagne flowed even more freely.

""Wow,"" I breathed, clutching my small clutch nervously. ""This is...""

""Spectacular?"" Chloe supplied, already scanning the room like a general surveying a battlefield. ""And full of eligible bachelors. Come on.""

She dragged me toward the bar, Noah following with an amused smile. After ordering champagne for us, Chloe turned to me with determination in her eyes.

""Drink up,"" she instructed. ""Liquid courage.""

I sipped the bubbly drink, feeling it fizz down my throat. ""I don't think I'm cut out for this, Chl.""

""Nonsense. You just need to relax."" She squeezed my hand. ""Look around. Everyone here is playing a character tonight. Why shouldn't you?""

As the champagne warmed my veins, I felt my anxiety slowly melting. Chloe was right. For once in my life, I could be someone else—someone confident and carefree.

An hour and two champagne flutes later, I was actually enjoying myself. Noah had swept Chloe onto the dance floor, leaving me people-watching from a quiet corner. The masks transformed everyone into mysterious characters from some elaborate play.

""You look far too beautiful to be standing alone.""

The deep voice startled me. I turned to find a tall figure standing beside me, his face partially concealed by a sleek black mask. But what the mask didn't hide took my breath away—full lips curved into a confident smile, a strong jawline, and the most unusual, striking violet-blue eyes I'd ever seen.

""I... thank you,"" I managed, cursing my sudden inability to form coherent sentences.

""Dance with me."" It wasn't a question, but there was something playful in his tone that made my heart race.

Before I could overthink it, I nodded. His hand found the small of my back, sending electricity through my body as he guided me to the dance floor. His touch was firm but gentle, confident without being presumptuous.

""I haven't seen you at one of these events before,"" he said, his voice like velvet as he pulled me closer. ""I would have remembered.""

I smiled behind my mask. ""How could you possibly know? Everyone's wearing masks.""

""Some people are impossible to forget, masked or not."" His eyes—those incredible eyes—roamed my face with undisguised appreciation.

The champagne in my system made me bold. ""Are you always this forward with strangers?""

""Only the exceptionally beautiful ones."" His hand tightened slightly on my waist. ""And only when they look at me the way you're looking at me right now.""

Heat flooded my cheeks. Was I that transparent? Something about this man was magnetic, drawing me in despite my usual caution. Maybe it was the anonymity of the masks, or maybe it was just him.

""And how exactly am I looking at you?"" I challenged.

His lips brushed my ear as he whispered, ""Like you're wondering what it would be like to kiss me.""

My breath caught. The music swelled around us, but all I could focus on was the warmth of his body against mine, the intoxicating scent of his cologne, and those eyes that seemed to see right through my mask and into my soul.

""Maybe I am,"" I admitted, surprising myself with my honesty.

His smile widened, revealing perfect white teeth. Without another word, he took my hand and led me away from the dance floor, through the crowd, and toward a dimly lit hallway.

My heart hammered against my ribs. This wasn't me—I didn't follow strangers into dark corners. And yet, I couldn't make myself stop. For once in my life, I wanted to be reckless.

The moment we were alone, he pressed me gently against the wall, one hand cupping my face while the other rested on my hip. ""Tell me to stop,"" he murmured, his face inches from mine.

""Don't stop,"" I whispered instead.

His lips crashed into mine with a hunger that matched my own. The kiss was nothing like I'd experienced before—demanding yet tender, passionate yet controlled. I melted against him, my hands gripping his shoulders as if I might float away without his anchoring presence.

""God, you're incredible,"" he groaned against my mouth, his hands sliding down to grip my thighs through the silky fabric of my dress.

I gasped as he lifted me slightly, pressing his body more firmly against mine. ""We shouldn't—"" I started, but the protest died as his lips found my neck.

""We absolutely should,"" he countered, his voice rough with desire. ""Unless you want me to stop?""

I knew I should say yes. This was madness—a stranger in a hallway at a masquerade ball. But the heat building between us was undeniable, and for once, I didn't want to be sensible Hazel.

""Don't you dare stop,"" I breathed.

His hands were everywhere then, exploring my body with an expertise that left me gasping. When he slipped under the hem of my dress, I didn't protest. When he pushed aside the thin fabric of my underwear, I only urged him on with breathy moans.

""I need you,"" he growled, his fingers working magic that had me clutching desperately at his shoulders. ""Right now.""

""Yes,"" was all I could manage.

What followed was a blur of sensations—his hands lifting me higher, my legs wrapping around his waist, the sound of his zipper, and then the exquisite feeling of him pushing inside me. The angle was perfect, the pressure divine. Each thrust sent waves of pleasure through my body until I was biting my lip to keep from crying out.

""Let go,"" he commanded softly, his rhythm intensifying. ""I want to hear you.""

I did as he asked, letting the quiet hallway fill with my breathless moans as he drove me toward a shattering climax. He followed moments later, his face buried in my neck as he shuddered against me.

For several heartbeats, we stayed locked together, our ragged breathing the only sound. Reality slowly began to seep back in, and with it came the first flickers of embarrassment. What had I done?

Before I could spiral into regret, he gently set me down, straightening my dress with tender care. ""That was..."" he trailed off, seemingly at a loss for words.

""Unexpected,"" I supplied, smoothing down my hair.

He laughed—a rich, warm sound that eased some of my anxiety. ""Spectacular was the word I was looking for.""

Just as he leaned in to kiss me again, a phone rang. He cursed under his breath, pulling a sleek device from his pocket. His expression changed instantly as he checked the screen.

""I have to take this,"" he said, already stepping back. ""Wait here. I'll be right back.""

Before I could respond, he was striding away, phone pressed to his ear. I leaned against the wall, feeling simultaneously elated and foolish. What had gotten into me? This wasn't who I was.

After ten minutes of waiting, it became clear he wasn't coming back. Humiliation washed over me. Of course he'd left—he'd gotten what he wanted from the naive girl at the masquerade.

I made my way back to the ballroom, scanning the crowd for any sign of him or Chloe. Finding neither, I texted Chloe that I was ready to leave.

""You did WHAT?"" Chloe shrieked as we sat in her living room later that night, Noah having tactfully retreated to the bedroom.

""Keep your voice down,"" I hissed, though we were alone. ""It was stupid, I know.""

""Stupid? It's brilliant!"" She clapped her hands together. ""My little Hazel, having hot masked sex at a fancy ball. I'm so proud!""

I groaned, burying my face in my hands. ""Don't be proud. Be horrified. I don't even know his name.""

""That's the best part,"" Chloe insisted. ""It's like something out of a romance novel. The mysterious stranger with the unusual eyes who rocks your world and disappears into the night.""

Despite my embarrassment, I couldn't help smiling. ""His eyes were incredible. This weird violet-blue color I've never seen before.""

""And how was the sex?"" Chloe leaned forward eagerly. ""Don't skimp on details.""

My cheeks burned, but I couldn't deny the lingering pleasure. ""It was amazing. Like nothing I've ever experienced. He was so... confident. Like he knew exactly what I needed.""

""Well, he clearly knew what he was doing,"" Chloe giggled. ""I knew this ball was exactly what you needed to get over Ethan.""

""I guess you were right,"" I admitted. ""For the first time in months, I didn't think about Ethan once.""

""See? Best therapy ever!"" Chloe raised her wine glass. ""To masked strangers and new beginnings!""

I clinked my glass against hers, feeling lighter than I had in months. Maybe this reckless night was exactly what I'd needed to finally move on.

""So,"" Chloe said casually, ""did you guys at least use protection?""

The glass nearly slipped from my fingers as cold realization washed over me. In the heat of the moment, protection hadn't crossed either of our minds.

""Oh my God,"" I whispered, panic clawing at my throat. ""We didn't.""

...

Chapter 3 - The Doctor's Bombshell and a Family's Embrace

Hazel's POV

""I can't believe you kept this,"" I said, taking the bottle of expensive perfume from Chloe's hands. It was the same scent I'd worn to the masquerade ball two weeks ago.

""Of course I kept it. You smelled amazing that night."" Chloe plopped down on my bed. ""And apparently, Mr. Mystery Man thought so too.""

I groaned, burying my face in my pillow. ""Stop bringing him up.""

""Why? He gave you the best sex of your life!"" Chloe nudged me playfully.

""And possibly an STD,"" I muttered, sitting up. ""My doctor's appointment is in an hour.""

Chloe's teasing smile faded. ""Hey, don't catastrophize. You're probably fine.""

""Probably isn't definitely,"" I countered. ""What kind of responsible person has unprotected sex with a stranger? I've never done anything like that before.""

""The kind who needed to break free after being cheated on by her boyfriend of three years with her own cousin,"" Chloe replied firmly. ""Besides, I'm going with you to the appointment.""

""You don't have to do that.""

""Shut up. I'm going."" She squeezed my hand. ""That's what best friends are for.""

Three weeks after my doctor's visit, I sat in the same sterile room with Chloe beside me, waiting for my test results. My leg bounced nervously as I checked my watch for the fifth time in two minutes.

""Relax,"" Chloe whispered. ""Whatever it is, we'll deal with it.""

Before I could respond, Dr. Evans walked in with a folder in hand and a neutral expression that revealed nothing.

""Hazel,"" she greeted me warmly, taking a seat across from us. ""How are you feeling today?""

""Anxious,"" I admitted. ""Just tell me straight – do I have something?""

Dr. Evans smiled reassuringly. ""Your STD panel came back completely negative. You're perfectly healthy.""

Relief flooded through me. I hadn't realized how tense I'd been until that moment. ""Thank God.""

""However,"" she continued, her tone shifting slightly, ""we did find something else in your bloodwork.""

My stomach dropped. ""What is it?""

""Congratulations, Hazel. You're pregnant.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. The room seemed to tilt sideways as blood rushed from my face.

""That's impossible,"" I whispered, though I knew it wasn't. ""We only... it was just one time.""

""That's all it takes,"" Dr. Evans said gently. ""Based on your hormone levels, I'd estimate you're about five weeks along.""

Chloe grabbed my hand, squeezing it so hard it hurt. ""Are you sure?"" she asked the doctor.

Dr. Evans nodded. ""The blood test is quite accurate. We can do an ultrasound today if you'd like confirmation.""

My mind raced wildly. Pregnant. With a stranger's baby. A man whose name I didn't know. A man with striking violet-blue eyes who had disappeared into the night.

""My parents are going to kill me,"" I choked out, tears welling up. ""I'm only twenty-three. I'm still in college.""

""Breathe, Hazel,"" Dr. Evans instructed calmly. ""You have options, and you have time to consider them all.""

""I can't have a baby,"" I whispered, panic rising in my chest. ""I don't even know who the father is. How am I supposed to tell my parents that?""

Chloe wrapped an arm around me. ""One step at a time, Hazel.""

Dr. Evans spent the next thirty minutes walking me through my options. Termination. Adoption. Keeping the baby. Each possibility made my head spin more than the last.

""Whatever you decide, don't do it alone,"" Dr. Evans advised as our appointment wrapped up. ""Talk to your parents, your friends. Get support.""

I nodded numbly, still in shock as Chloe guided me out of the office.

""Eat something,"" Chloe urged, pushing a plate of fries toward me in the diner where we'd met Noah after my appointment. ""For the baby.""

""The baby,"" I repeated, the words still foreign on my tongue. ""I'm having a baby.""

Noah reached across the table and squeezed my hand. ""We're here for you, Hazel. Whatever you need.""

I looked between them, these two people who had stood by me through everything. ""I don't know what to do.""

""What does your gut tell you?"" Chloe asked softly.

I placed a hand on my still-flat stomach. Despite the fear coursing through me, I couldn't imagine terminating the pregnancy. ""I think... I think I want to keep it.""

Tears spilled down my cheeks as I said the words aloud for the first time. ""But I'm so scared.""

""You'd be crazy not to be,"" Noah said. ""But you're not alone in this.""

A watery laugh escaped me. ""You guys are my rocks, you know that? Will you..."" I hesitated, then pushed forward. ""Will you be the baby's godparents?""

Chloe's eyes widened before she burst into tears and threw her arms around me. ""Yes! A million times yes!""

Noah smiled, his own eyes suspiciously bright. ""We'd be honored.""

For the first time since hearing the news, I felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, we could make this work.

That night, I sat on my parents' couch, hands trembling as I waited for them to join me. Chloe sat beside me, a solid presence of support.

""What's this about, honey?"" my mother asked as she and my father settled across from us. ""You sounded upset on the phone.""

I took a deep breath, fighting back tears. ""Mom, Dad... I have something to tell you.""

The concern in their eyes only made this harder. My father leaned forward. ""Whatever it is, you can tell us.""

""I'm pregnant,"" I blurted out, the words hanging heavy in the suddenly silent room.

My mother's hand flew to her mouth. My father went completely still.

""It happened at that masquerade ball,"" I continued, words tumbling out. ""I was stupid and reckless, and I don't even know his name. I'm so, so sorry to disappoint you both.""

My mother recovered first. ""Oh, Hazel,"" she whispered, her eyes filling with tears.

""How could you be so irresponsible?"" My father's voice was tight with disappointment. ""We raised you better than this.""

Each word was like a knife to my heart. ""I know,"" I whispered, tears streaming down my face. ""I messed up.""

""What are you planning to do?"" my mother asked carefully.

""I want to keep it,"" I said quietly. ""I know it won't be easy, but this baby is part of me, and I already love it.""

My father stood abruptly and walked to the window, his back to us. The silence stretched painfully.

""Dad, please say something,"" I begged.

He turned slowly, and I braced myself for his anger. Instead, I saw his eyes were wet with tears.

""You'll stay here,"" he said firmly. ""We'll convert the office into a nursery.""

""What?"" I gasped.

""You heard me."" He crossed the room and knelt before me, taking my hands in his. ""You're our daughter, Hazel. This isn't how we imagined things would go, but that baby is our grandchild. We're not going to kick you out.""

Fresh tears spilled down my cheeks. ""I thought you'd be so angry.""

""We're disappointed,"" my mother admitted, moving to sit beside me. ""But we love you, and we'll help you through this.""

""You need to finish college,"" my father insisted. ""That's non-negotiable. That baby will need a mother who can provide for it.""

""I will,"" I promised. ""I'll work harder than ever.""

My father pulled me into a fierce hug. ""I know you will, sweetheart. You've always made us proud, even when you make mistakes.""

As my parents embraced me, with Chloe smiling tearfully from the side, I felt the crushing weight of fear begin to lift. With this much love surrounding us, maybe my baby and I would be okay after all.

The months that followed weren't easy. Word spread quickly around campus, and the whispers followed me everywhere. Ethan and Jessica were the worst, spreading cruel rumors about who the father might be.

But for every cruel word, there was a moment of grace. My professors worked with me to ensure I could complete my degree. Chloe and Noah came to every doctor's appointment. My parents transformed their home office into a beautiful nursery painted in soft yellows and greens.

When my son was born on a crisp autumn morning, the first thing everyone noticed was his eyes—an extraordinary violet-blue that immediately took me back to that night at the masquerade ball. I named him Leonardo Arthur Vance—Leo for short—after my grandfather and father.

As I held my perfect baby boy, surrounded by my parents, Chloe, and Noah, I knew that despite the unconventional start, we were going to be okay.

The next three years flew by in a blur of sleepless nights, diaper changes, and college papers written during nap times. My parents were my salvation, watching Leo while I attended classes and worked part-time. Chloe and Noah doted on their godson, spoiling him with love and too many toys.

Despite the challenges, I graduated on time, standing proudly in my cap and gown with three-year-old Leo perched on my hip. As I accepted my diploma, I made a silent promise to my beautiful boy with the striking eyes—he would never lack for anything, not if I had anything to say about it.

Chapter 4 - A New Chapter in Haven Harbor

Hazel's POV

The sound of a spoon tapping against a champagne glass cut through the chatter in the small conference room. I turned to see Aiden Dalton, my boss of three years, standing with a proud smile on his face.

""Everyone, please join me in congratulating Hazel Vance on her graduation!""

Applause erupted from my coworkers. My cheeks warmed as they raised their plastic cups of sparkling cider in my direction. The small surprise party they'd organized touched me more than they could know.

""Thank you all so much,"" I said, fighting back tears. ""Working here while finishing my degree hasn't been easy, but your support made it possible.""

Aiden approached me with an envelope. ""We're so proud of you, Hazel. But now that you've got your degree, I have to insist you start looking for opportunities in your field.""

I frowned. ""Are you firing me?""

He laughed. ""Of course not! But you're overqualified for admin work now. You deserve better.""

""But I love it here. The hours work perfectly with Leo's schedule, and everyone's been so understanding when emergencies come up.""

Aiden placed his hand on my shoulder. ""And we've loved having you. But you've worked too hard to settle.""

I nodded, knowing he was right. My business degree with a specialty in marketing operations demanded more than filing paperwork and answering phones. Leo and I deserved better.

As the party wound down, I started clearing paper plates when my phone buzzed. Chloe's name flashed on the screen.

""What's up?"" I asked, cradling the phone against my shoulder.

""Guess who just got off the phone with my dad?""

""Oscar? What did he want?"" I asked, curious. Chloe's father had always been kind to me, especially after Leo was born.

""He wants to know if you're interested in interviewing for an executive assistant position.""

I nearly dropped the stack of plates I was holding. ""At his company?""

""No, better! At Sterling Group in Haven Harbor. Dad plays golf with one of their board members. Their CEO's assistant is retiring, and they need someone exceptional to replace her.""

My mouth went dry. Sterling Group was one of the most prestigious corporations on the East Coast. ""That's... that's way out of my league, Chl.""

""No, it's not! You've basically been running Aiden's office since you started. This is perfect timing with your graduation.""

""But Haven Harbor is three hours away,"" I pointed out. ""I can't uproot Leo like that.""

""Actually..."" Chloe's voice took on that tone she used when she was about to reveal a surprise. ""Noah just got offered a position at Haven Harbor Hospital. Senior PR coordinator.""

I gasped. ""Chloe! That's amazing! Why didn't you tell me?""

""I was waiting for the right moment. And now it's here!"" She paused dramatically. ""I already found us an amazing furnished apartment with three bedrooms. One for you, one for me, and one for little Leo.""

""Us? You want us to live together?""

""Of course! And before you ask, Noah already arranged to transfer his tech job to their Haven Harbor branch. We'll all be together!""

I sank into a chair, overwhelmed. ""This is happening so fast.""

""Sometimes fast is good,"" Chloe said softly. ""Haven Harbor could be a fresh start for all of us. No more running into Ethan and Jessica at the grocery store. No more whispers from people who've known you since kindergarten.""

She was right. Ever since Ethan had cheated on me with my cousin, and even more since I'd returned from that masquerade ball pregnant, my hometown had felt suffocating with judgment.

""When's the interview?"" I asked, my decision already made.

""Tomorrow at ten. Video call with someone named Evelyn Reed.""

My heart raced. ""Tomorrow? That's so soon!""

""Fortune favors the bold, Hazel. This is your moment to shine.""

The next morning, I sat at my kitchen table in my nicest blouse, hands trembling slightly as I waited for the video call to connect. Leo was with my parents, giving me the quiet I needed.

When the screen lit up, I was faced with an elegant older woman with light blonde hair twisted into a neat bun. Her smile was warm, putting me instantly at ease.

""Miss Vance? I'm Evelyn Reed, current executive assistant to Mr. Sterling. Thank you for making time for this interview.""

""Thank you for considering me, Ms. Reed.""

She chuckled. ""Call me Evelyn, please. Now, Oscar Dalton speaks very highly of you, but I'd like to hear about your experience in your own words.""

For the next forty minutes, I detailed my work experience, education, and skills. Evelyn asked pointed questions about my organizational methods, ability to handle pressure, and experience with confidential information.

""The position is demanding,"" she explained. ""Mr. Sterling runs a tight ship and expects excellence. His schedule is packed, and you'll be responsible for managing it flawlessly. There will be late nights and occasional weekend work.""

""I understand,"" I replied, straightening my shoulders. ""I should mention that I have a three-year-old son. His care is my priority, but I'm committed to excellence in my work as well.""

I held my breath, waiting for the polite rejection that often followed this disclosure.

Instead, Evelyn smiled. ""I raised two children while working for Mr. Sterling's father. The company values work-life balance, within reason. As long as the work gets done exceptionally well, there's flexibility for family needs.""

Relief washed over me. ""That's wonderful to hear.""

""Now for the practical details,"" she continued. ""The salary is $85,000 annually with comprehensive benefits, including childcare assistance. You'd start next Monday, spending two weeks training with me before I retire.""

I nearly choked. That was more than double what I currently made.

""That sounds... that would be amazing,"" I managed.

Evelyn studied me through the screen. ""I've interviewed twelve candidates this week, Hazel. You're the only one I've offered the position to. Something tells me you're exactly what Mr. Sterling needs.""

My eyes widened. ""You're offering me the job? Now?""

""I trust my instincts. And Oscar Dalton doesn't recommend people lightly."" Her blue eyes twinkled. ""Will you accept?""

""Yes,"" I said without hesitation. ""Absolutely yes.""

""Excellent. I'll email you the paperwork today. We'll see you Monday at 8 AM sharp.""

After we disconnected, I sat in stunned silence for several minutes before calling Chloe with the news. Her excited screams almost shattered my eardrum.

Telling my parents was harder than I expected. We sat in their living room after dinner, Leo playing with blocks nearby.

""Haven Harbor?"" My mother's voice quavered. ""But that's so far away.""

""It's only three hours, Mom,"" I reminded her gently. ""And the opportunity is incredible.""

My father took my mother's hand. ""We knew this day would come, Serena. Hazel needs to build her own life.""

""But what about Leo?"" she asked, glancing at my son. ""He's so used to being here with us while you work.""

""Chloe found an apartment right near a highly-rated daycare center,"" I explained. ""And the company offers childcare assistance. He'll be well taken care of.""

""Who will watch him when he's sick?"" My mother's eyes filled with tears. ""Who will know that he likes his sandwiches cut into dinosaur shapes?""

I moved to sit beside her, wrapping my arm around her shoulders. ""I'll know, Mom. And I'll teach his caregivers. But this job means I can give him everything he deserves.""

My father cleared his throat. ""Your mother and I are just going to miss you both terribly.""

""I know,"" I whispered, my own eyes welling up. ""We'll miss you too. But we'll visit often, I promise.""

Leo looked up from his blocks, sensing the emotional atmosphere. He toddled over and climbed onto my lap.

""Mama sad?"" he asked, his extraordinary violet-blue eyes—so like his unknown father's—searching my face with concern.

""No, baby. Mama's happy,"" I assured him, kissing his forehead. ""We're going on an adventure soon.""

""Venture!"" he repeated excitedly, making us all laugh through our tears.

My father stood and pulled me into a hug, Leo squished comfortably between us. ""We're so proud of you, sweetheart. You've overcome more in three years than most people face in a lifetime.""

""We just want what's best for you both,"" my mother added, joining our embrace.

In that moment, surrounded by their love, I knew I was making the right choice. Haven Harbor would be a new beginning for Leo and me—a place where we could build our future together, without the weight of the past holding us down.

The week flew by in a flurry of packing, paperwork, and tearful goodbyes. Before I knew it, Sunday afternoon arrived, and Chloe, Noah, Leo, and I stood outside our new apartment building in Haven Harbor.

""Home sweet home!"" Chloe announced, unlocking the door with a flourish.

The apartment was spacious and bright, with large windows overlooking the harbor. True to Chloe's word, it was fully furnished with tasteful, comfortable pieces.

""This is way nicer than you described,"" I gasped, taking in the open-concept living area and gleaming kitchen.

""Only the best for my godson and best friend,"" she replied with a wink. ""Leo, want to see your room?""

My son nodded eagerly, his little hand clasped in Noah's as they followed Chloe down the hallway.

""I painted it blue like the ocean!"" Chloe called over her shoulder. ""And there might be a surprise waiting for him!""

Leo's delighted squeal moments later confirmed her hint. I found them in a charming room with ocean-blue walls and a brand new train table in the corner. Leo was already pushing a wooden engine along the tracks, completely enraptured.

""Chl, this is too much,"" I protested weakly.

She waved away my concern. ""The apartment's a steal—Dad knows the owner. And the train table is from all of us. Leo's birthday is next month anyway.""

I hugged her fiercely. ""I don't deserve you.""

""Yes, you do,"" she replied simply. ""Now go unpack. Your first day at Sterling Group is tomorrow, and you need your beauty sleep!""

Later that night, after Leo was tucked into his new bed and Chloe and Noah had retreated to their room, I unpacked my final box. At the bottom, nestled in tissue paper, was a small wooden jewelry box I'd brought from my parents' house.

I opened it carefully, revealing the contents I hadn't looked at in over three years: a delicate gold mask, a dried rose, and a nearly empty bottle of expensive perfume—mementos from the masquerade ball that had changed my life forever.

I lifted the perfume bottle, removing the stopper to catch its scent—a complex blend of amber, jasmine, and vanilla that immediately transported me back to that magical night. The night I'd felt beautiful and desirable after months of heartbreak. The night I'd fallen into the arms of a stranger with mesmerizing violet-blue eyes—eyes my son now shared.

On an impulse, I dabbed a drop behind each ear. Tomorrow marked the beginning of my new life. A fresh start. A chance to prove myself at Sterling Group.

I placed the perfume bottle on my dresser instead of returning it to the box. Perhaps it was time to stop hiding these memories away. The masquerade ball had given me Leo—the best thing in my life. I wouldn't be ashamed of that night anymore.

As I crawled into bed, the scent of the perfume enveloped me like an embrace from the past. Tomorrow I would walk into Sterling Group wearing it, a silent reminder of my strength and the beautiful life I was building, one challenge at a time.",1,1754085925.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Hazel's POV

I stumbled through my front door, exhaustion weighing on my shoulders like a heavy blanket. My feet ached after standing for eight hours at the bookstore, followed by a three-hour evening class at the community college. All I wanted was a hot shower and my bed.

Instead, I found my parents waiting in the living room, their expressions grim.

""Hazel, we need to talk,"" my father said, his voice unusually stern.

I dropped my bag by the door. ""Can it wait until morning? I'm dead on my feet.""

""No, it can't,"" Mom replied, holding up a cream-colored envelope. ""This arrived today.""

The fancy gold script made my stomach twist before I could even read it. I already knew what it was.

""Jessica's wedding invitation,"" she announced, as if it were a normal thing to discuss. As if Jessica hadn't destroyed my life less than six months ago.

""That backstabbing witch is not my cousin,"" I snapped, anger immediately replacing my exhaustion.

Dad's face reddened. ""Hazel Marie Vance! That's enough of that language.""

""She slept with Ethan in my bed!"" My voice cracked. ""My boyfriend of four years. In my room, Dad.""

Mom sighed dramatically. ""Ethan was at fault since he was your boyfriend. Jessica was just... confused. He manipulated her.""

I laughed bitterly. ""Confused? Is that what we're calling it? She knew exactly what she was doing.""

""This childish feud needs to end,"" Mom continued, ignoring my pain. ""Your aunt is heartbroken that you've been avoiding family gatherings.""

""I'm sorry my trauma is so inconvenient for everyone,"" I muttered.

Dad stood up, towering over me. ""You're going to this wedding, Hazel. That's final.""

""I'm what?"" I stared at him in disbelief.

""You heard me. Your mother wants peace in the family, and you're going to help make that happen.""

""By watching the man I thought I'd marry walk down the aisle with my cousin?"" My eyes stung with tears. ""Do you have any idea how humiliating that would be?""

Mom's lips thinned into a disapproving line. ""It's been six months. You need to move on.""

""I have moved on! Moving on doesn't mean I need to celebrate their relationship!""

""ENOUGH!"" Dad's shout made me flinch. ""This isn't a debate. You're going to be there with a smile on your face, or you can find somewhere else to live.""

The ultimatum hung in the air between us. I turned and fled to my room, tears streaming down my face. I heard my mother call after me, but I slammed my door, muffling her voice.

I collapsed onto my bed, sobs wracking my body. After everything Ethan and Jessica had done, my parents were still taking their side. The betrayal cut deeper than I thought possible.

""They're making you go to the wedding?"" Chloe's eyes widened in outrage as she slid a coffee across the breakroom table to me. ""That's cruel, even for your parents.""

I'd called her the moment I woke up, and she'd immediately rushed to meet me at work during my break. Chloe had been my best friend since kindergarten, and unlike my family, she'd been fiercely loyal after the Ethan-Jessica disaster.

""Dad threatened to kick me out if I don't go."" I stared into my coffee. ""I can't afford my own place yet.""

""Those self-righteous—"" Chloe cut herself off, her expression suddenly changing. ""Wait. When is this wedding again?""

""Next Saturday,"" I mumbled.

A sly grin spread across her face. ""Perfect. The Sterling Masquerade Ball is the same night.""

""The what?""

""Only the most exclusive event of the year,"" Chloe explained, excitement building in her voice. ""My father got invited through business connections. I have two extra tickets.""

""Chloe, I can't—""

""Yes, you can. Tell your parents it's a networking event for your career. Which isn't even a lie—half the city's business elite will be there.""

""They'll never buy it.""

""Leave that to me."" She squeezed my hand. ""No way are you watching Jessica marry your ex. You're coming to a masquerade ball with me instead.""

Three days later, Chloe had somehow convinced not only my parents but her boyfriend Noah to go along with the plan. She'd spun the ball as a crucial networking opportunity, even getting her father to call mine about the ""professional connections"" I could make.

""See? Problem solved,"" she announced triumphantly as we sat in my bedroom. ""You'll stay at my place Friday night, and we'll get ready together Saturday.""

I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. ""Have I told you lately that you're the best friend ever?""

""Not nearly enough,"" she winked. ""Now we just need to find you something spectacular to wear.""

The night of the ball arrived faster than I expected. Standing in Chloe's bedroom, I hardly recognized the woman in the mirror. My long black hair cascaded down my back in loose waves, and the deep red satin dress hugged my curves perfectly.

""The final touch,"" Chloe whispered, handing me an intricate golden mask that covered the upper half of my face.

I placed it over my eyes, securing the ribbon behind my head. The person staring back at me looked mysterious, confident—nothing like the heartbroken girl who'd been crying herself to sleep for months.

""You look incredible,"" Chloe breathed, adjusting her own silver mask. ""If Ethan could see you now, he'd regret everything.""

Noah knocked on the bedroom door. ""Ladies? The car's waiting.""

As we headed toward the door, panic suddenly gripped my chest. What was I doing? I wasn't the kind of girl who went to lavish parties or defied her parents. What if they found out? What if I ran into someone who knew me?

""Wait,"" I whispered, grabbing Chloe's arm. My heart hammered against my ribs. ""I don't think I can do this.""

""What's wrong?"" Chloe turned to me, concern in her eyes.

""I'm not... I'm not brave like you. Maybe I should just stay here."" The thought of facing a ballroom full of strangers made my stomach twist. ""Please, Chloe, let me stay?""

...

Chapter 2 - A Reckless Encounter

Hazel's POV

""No way, Hazel. I didn't spend three hours making you look like a goddess just so you could hide in my apartment."" Chloe grabbed my shoulders firmly. ""Tonight, you're not going to be the responsible, practical Hazel who always follows the rules. Tonight, you're going to live a little.""

I stared at my reflection one more time, hardly recognizing myself behind the golden mask. My bright green eyes shimmered with nervousness, but also something else—anticipation.

""What if someone recognizes me?"" I whispered.

Noah chuckled from the doorway. ""That's the point of a masquerade, Hazel. No one knows who anyone is.""

""Exactly,"" Chloe nodded triumphantly. ""For one night, you can be whoever you want to be. No ex-boyfriend, no backstabbing cousin, no disappointed parents. Just you, having fun for once in your life.""

Her words hit home. When was the last time I'd actually had fun? Before catching Ethan and Jessica together, probably.

""Fine,"" I conceded, taking a deep breath. ""One night of freedom.""

The Sterling Masquerade Ball was nothing like I'd imagined. The grand ballroom glittered with crystal chandeliers, while masked figures in suits and gowns mingled like characters from a fairy tale. Classical music flowed from a live orchestra, and champagne flowed even more freely.

""Wow,"" I breathed, clutching my small clutch nervously. ""This is...""

""Spectacular?"" Chloe supplied, already scanning the room like a general surveying a battlefield. ""And full of eligible bachelors. Come on.""

She dragged me toward the bar, Noah following with an amused smile. After ordering champagne for us, Chloe turned to me with determination in her eyes.

""Drink up,"" she instructed. ""Liquid courage.""

I sipped the bubbly drink, feeling it fizz down my throat. ""I don't think I'm cut out for this, Chl.""

""Nonsense. You just need to relax."" She squeezed my hand. ""Look around. Everyone here is playing a character tonight. Why shouldn't you?""

As the champagne warmed my veins, I felt my anxiety slowly melting. Chloe was right. For once in my life, I could be someone else—someone confident and carefree.

An hour and two champagne flutes later, I was actually enjoying myself. Noah had swept Chloe onto the dance floor, leaving me people-watching from a quiet corner. The masks transformed everyone into mysterious characters from some elaborate play.

""You look far too beautiful to be standing alone.""

The deep voice startled me. I turned to find a tall figure standing beside me, his face partially concealed by a sleek black mask. But what the mask didn't hide took my breath away—full lips curved into a confident smile, a strong jawline, and the most unusual, striking violet-blue eyes I'd ever seen.

""I... thank you,"" I managed, cursing my sudden inability to form coherent sentences.

""Dance with me."" It wasn't a question, but there was something playful in his tone that made my heart race.

Before I could overthink it, I nodded. His hand found the small of my back, sending electricity through my body as he guided me to the dance floor. His touch was firm but gentle, confident without being presumptuous.

""I haven't seen you at one of these events before,"" he said, his voice like velvet as he pulled me closer. ""I would have remembered.""

I smiled behind my mask. ""How could you possibly know? Everyone's wearing masks.""

""Some people are impossible to forget, masked or not."" His eyes—those incredible eyes—roamed my face with undisguised appreciation.

The champagne in my system made me bold. ""Are you always this forward with strangers?""

""Only the exceptionally beautiful ones."" His hand tightened slightly on my waist. ""And only when they look at me the way you're looking at me right now.""

Heat flooded my cheeks. Was I that transparent? Something about this man was magnetic, drawing me in despite my usual caution. Maybe it was the anonymity of the masks, or maybe it was just him.

""And how exactly am I looking at you?"" I challenged.

His lips brushed my ear as he whispered, ""Like you're wondering what it would be like to kiss me.""

My breath caught. The music swelled around us, but all I could focus on was the warmth of his body against mine, the intoxicating scent of his cologne, and those eyes that seemed to see right through my mask and into my soul.

""Maybe I am,"" I admitted, surprising myself with my honesty.

His smile widened, revealing perfect white teeth. Without another word, he took my hand and led me away from the dance floor, through the crowd, and toward a dimly lit hallway.

My heart hammered against my ribs. This wasn't me—I didn't follow strangers into dark corners. And yet, I couldn't make myself stop. For once in my life, I wanted to be reckless.

The moment we were alone, he pressed me gently against the wall, one hand cupping my face while the other rested on my hip. ""Tell me to stop,"" he murmured, his face inches from mine.

""Don't stop,"" I whispered instead.

His lips crashed into mine with a hunger that matched my own. The kiss was nothing like I'd experienced before—demanding yet tender, passionate yet controlled. I melted against him, my hands gripping his shoulders as if I might float away without his anchoring presence.

""God, you're incredible,"" he groaned against my mouth, his hands sliding down to grip my thighs through the silky fabric of my dress.

I gasped as he lifted me slightly, pressing his body more firmly against mine. ""We shouldn't—"" I started, but the protest died as his lips found my neck.

""We absolutely should,"" he countered, his voice rough with desire. ""Unless you want me to stop?""

I knew I should say yes. This was madness—a stranger in a hallway at a masquerade ball. But the heat building between us was undeniable, and for once, I didn't want to be sensible Hazel.

""Don't you dare stop,"" I breathed.

His hands were everywhere then, exploring my body with an expertise that left me gasping. When he slipped under the hem of my dress, I didn't protest. When he pushed aside the thin fabric of my underwear, I only urged him on with breathy moans.

""I need you,"" he growled, his fingers working magic that had me clutching desperately at his shoulders. ""Right now.""

""Yes,"" was all I could manage.

What followed was a blur of sensations—his hands lifting me higher, my legs wrapping around his waist, the sound of his zipper, and then the exquisite feeling of him pushing inside me. The angle was perfect, the pressure divine. Each thrust sent waves of pleasure through my body until I was biting my lip to keep from crying out.

""Let go,"" he commanded softly, his rhythm intensifying. ""I want to hear you.""

I did as he asked, letting the quiet hallway fill with my breathless moans as he drove me toward a shattering climax. He followed moments later, his face buried in my neck as he shuddered against me.

For several heartbeats, we stayed locked together, our ragged breathing the only sound. Reality slowly began to seep back in, and with it came the first flickers of embarrassment. What had I done?

Before I could spiral into regret, he gently set me down, straightening my dress with tender care. ""That was..."" he trailed off, seemingly at a loss for words.

""Unexpected,"" I supplied, smoothing down my hair.

He laughed—a rich, warm sound that eased some of my anxiety. ""Spectacular was the word I was looking for.""

Just as he leaned in to kiss me again, a phone rang. He cursed under his breath, pulling a sleek device from his pocket. His expression changed instantly as he checked the screen.

""I have to take this,"" he said, already stepping back. ""Wait here. I'll be right back.""

Before I could respond, he was striding away, phone pressed to his ear. I leaned against the wall, feeling simultaneously elated and foolish. What had gotten into me? This wasn't who I was.

After ten minutes of waiting, it became clear he wasn't coming back. Humiliation washed over me. Of course he'd left—he'd gotten what he wanted from the naive girl at the masquerade.

I made my way back to the ballroom, scanning the crowd for any sign of him or Chloe. Finding neither, I texted Chloe that I was ready to leave.

""You did WHAT?"" Chloe shrieked as we sat in her living room later that night, Noah having tactfully retreated to the bedroom.

""Keep your voice down,"" I hissed, though we were alone. ""It was stupid, I know.""

""Stupid? It's brilliant!"" She clapped her hands together. ""My little Hazel, having hot masked sex at a fancy ball. I'm so proud!""

I groaned, burying my face in my hands. ""Don't be proud. Be horrified. I don't even know his name.""

""That's the best part,"" Chloe insisted. ""It's like something out of a romance novel. The mysterious stranger with the unusual eyes who rocks your world and disappears into the night.""

Despite my embarrassment, I couldn't help smiling. ""His eyes were incredible. This weird violet-blue color I've never seen before.""

""And how was the sex?"" Chloe leaned forward eagerly. ""Don't skimp on details.""

My cheeks burned, but I couldn't deny the lingering pleasure. ""It was amazing. Like nothing I've ever experienced. He was so... confident. Like he knew exactly what I needed.""

""Well, he clearly knew what he was doing,"" Chloe giggled. ""I knew this ball was exactly what you needed to get over Ethan.""

""I guess you were right,"" I admitted. ""For the first time in months, I didn't think about Ethan once.""

""See? Best therapy ever!"" Chloe raised her wine glass. ""To masked strangers and new beginnings!""

I clinked my glass against hers, feeling lighter than I had in months. Maybe this reckless night was exactly what I'd needed to finally move on.

""So,"" Chloe said casually, ""did you guys at least use protection?""

The glass nearly slipped from my fingers as cold realization washed over me. In the heat of the moment, protection hadn't crossed either of our minds.

""Oh my God,"" I whispered, panic clawing at my throat. ""We didn't.""

...

Chapter 3 - The Doctor's Bombshell and a Family's Embrace

Hazel's POV

""I can't believe you kept this,"" I said, taking the bottle of expensive perfume from Chloe's hands. It was the same scent I'd worn to the masquerade ball two weeks ago.

""Of course I kept it. You smelled amazing that night."" Chloe plopped down on my bed. ""And apparently, Mr. Mystery Man thought so too.""

I groaned, burying my face in my pillow. ""Stop bringing him up.""

""Why? He gave you the best sex of your life!"" Chloe nudged me playfully.

""And possibly an STD,"" I muttered, sitting up. ""My doctor's appointment is in an hour.""

Chloe's teasing smile faded. ""Hey, don't catastrophize. You're probably fine.""

""Probably isn't definitely,"" I countered. ""What kind of responsible person has unprotected sex with a stranger? I've never done anything like that before.""

""The kind who needed to break free after being cheated on by her boyfriend of three years with her own cousin,"" Chloe replied firmly. ""Besides, I'm going with you to the appointment.""

""You don't have to do that.""

""Shut up. I'm going."" She squeezed my hand. ""That's what best friends are for.""

Three weeks after my doctor's visit, I sat in the same sterile room with Chloe beside me, waiting for my test results. My leg bounced nervously as I checked my watch for the fifth time in two minutes.

""Relax,"" Chloe whispered. ""Whatever it is, we'll deal with it.""

Before I could respond, Dr. Evans walked in with a folder in hand and a neutral expression that revealed nothing.

""Hazel,"" she greeted me warmly, taking a seat across from us. ""How are you feeling today?""

""Anxious,"" I admitted. ""Just tell me straight – do I have something?""

Dr. Evans smiled reassuringly. ""Your STD panel came back completely negative. You're perfectly healthy.""

Relief flooded through me. I hadn't realized how tense I'd been until that moment. ""Thank God.""

""However,"" she continued, her tone shifting slightly, ""we did find something else in your bloodwork.""

My stomach dropped. ""What is it?""

""Congratulations, Hazel. You're pregnant.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. The room seemed to tilt sideways as blood rushed from my face.

""That's impossible,"" I whispered, though I knew it wasn't. ""We only... it was just one time.""

""That's all it takes,"" Dr. Evans said gently. ""Based on your hormone levels, I'd estimate you're about five weeks along.""

Chloe grabbed my hand, squeezing it so hard it hurt. ""Are you sure?"" she asked the doctor.

Dr. Evans nodded. ""The blood test is quite accurate. We can do an ultrasound today if you'd like confirmation.""

My mind raced wildly. Pregnant. With a stranger's baby. A man whose name I didn't know. A man with striking violet-blue eyes who had disappeared into the night.

""My parents are going to kill me,"" I choked out, tears welling up. ""I'm only twenty-three. I'm still in college.""

""Breathe, Hazel,"" Dr. Evans instructed calmly. ""You have options, and you have time to consider them all.""

""I can't have a baby,"" I whispered, panic rising in my chest. ""I don't even know who the father is. How am I supposed to tell my parents that?""

Chloe wrapped an arm around me. ""One step at a time, Hazel.""

Dr. Evans spent the next thirty minutes walking me through my options. Termination. Adoption. Keeping the baby. Each possibility made my head spin more than the last.

""Whatever you decide, don't do it alone,"" Dr. Evans advised as our appointment wrapped up. ""Talk to your parents, your friends. Get support.""

I nodded numbly, still in shock as Chloe guided me out of the office.

""Eat something,"" Chloe urged, pushing a plate of fries toward me in the diner where we'd met Noah after my appointment. ""For the baby.""

""The baby,"" I repeated, the words still foreign on my tongue. ""I'm having a baby.""

Noah reached across the table and squeezed my hand. ""We're here for you, Hazel. Whatever you need.""

I looked between them, these two people who had stood by me through everything. ""I don't know what to do.""

""What does your gut tell you?"" Chloe asked softly.

I placed a hand on my still-flat stomach. Despite the fear coursing through me, I couldn't imagine terminating the pregnancy. ""I think... I think I want to keep it.""

Tears spilled down my cheeks as I said the words aloud for the first time. ""But I'm so scared.""

""You'd be crazy not to be,"" Noah said. ""But you're not alone in this.""

A watery laugh escaped me. ""You guys are my rocks, you know that? Will you..."" I hesitated, then pushed forward. ""Will you be the baby's godparents?""

Chloe's eyes widened before she burst into tears and threw her arms around me. ""Yes! A million times yes!""

Noah smiled, his own eyes suspiciously bright. ""We'd be honored.""

For the first time since hearing the news, I felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, we could make this work.

That night, I sat on my parents' couch, hands trembling as I waited for them to join me. Chloe sat beside me, a solid presence of support.

""What's this about, honey?"" my mother asked as she and my father settled across from us. ""You sounded upset on the phone.""

I took a deep breath, fighting back tears. ""Mom, Dad... I have something to tell you.""

The concern in their eyes only made this harder. My father leaned forward. ""Whatever it is, you can tell us.""

""I'm pregnant,"" I blurted out, the words hanging heavy in the suddenly silent room.

My mother's hand flew to her mouth. My father went completely still.

""It happened at that masquerade ball,"" I continued, words tumbling out. ""I was stupid and reckless, and I don't even know his name. I'm so, so sorry to disappoint you both.""

My mother recovered first. ""Oh, Hazel,"" she whispered, her eyes filling with tears.

""How could you be so irresponsible?"" My father's voice was tight with disappointment. ""We raised you better than this.""

Each word was like a knife to my heart. ""I know,"" I whispered, tears streaming down my face. ""I messed up.""

""What are you planning to do?"" my mother asked carefully.

""I want to keep it,"" I said quietly. ""I know it won't be easy, but this baby is part of me, and I already love it.""

My father stood abruptly and walked to the window, his back to us. The silence stretched painfully.

""Dad, please say something,"" I begged.

He turned slowly, and I braced myself for his anger. Instead, I saw his eyes were wet with tears.

""You'll stay here,"" he said firmly. ""We'll convert the office into a nursery.""

""What?"" I gasped.

""You heard me."" He crossed the room and knelt before me, taking my hands in his. ""You're our daughter, Hazel. This isn't how we imagined things would go, but that baby is our grandchild. We're not going to kick you out.""

Fresh tears spilled down my cheeks. ""I thought you'd be so angry.""

""We're disappointed,"" my mother admitted, moving to sit beside me. ""But we love you, and we'll help you through this.""

""You need to finish college,"" my father insisted. ""That's non-negotiable. That baby will need a mother who can provide for it.""

""I will,"" I promised. ""I'll work harder than ever.""

My father pulled me into a fierce hug. ""I know you will, sweetheart. You've always made us proud, even when you make mistakes.""

As my parents embraced me, with Chloe smiling tearfully from the side, I felt the crushing weight of fear begin to lift. With this much love surrounding us, maybe my baby and I would be okay after all.

The months that followed weren't easy. Word spread quickly around campus, and the whispers followed me everywhere. Ethan and Jessica were the worst, spreading cruel rumors about who the father might be.

But for every cruel word, there was a moment of grace. My professors worked with me to ensure I could complete my degree. Chloe and Noah came to every doctor's appointment. My parents transformed their home office into a beautiful nursery painted in soft yellows and greens.

When my son was born on a crisp autumn morning, the first thing everyone noticed was his eyes—an extraordinary violet-blue that immediately took me back to that night at the masquerade ball. I named him Leonardo Arthur Vance—Leo for short—after my grandfather and father.

As I held my perfect baby boy, surrounded by my parents, Chloe, and Noah, I knew that despite the unconventional start, we were going to be okay.

The next three years flew by in a blur of sleepless nights, diaper changes, and college papers written during nap times. My parents were my salvation, watching Leo while I attended classes and worked part-time. Chloe and Noah doted on their godson, spoiling him with love and too many toys.

Despite the challenges, I graduated on time, standing proudly in my cap and gown with three-year-old Leo perched on my hip. As I accepted my diploma, I made a silent promise to my beautiful boy with the striking eyes—he would never lack for anything, not if I had anything to say about it.

...

Chapter 4 - A New Chapter in Haven Harbor

Hazel's POV

The sound of a spoon tapping against a champagne glass cut through the chatter in the small conference room. I turned to see Aiden Dalton, my boss of three years, standing with a proud smile on his face.

""Everyone, please join me in congratulating Hazel Vance on her graduation!""

Applause erupted from my coworkers. My cheeks warmed as they raised their plastic cups of sparkling cider in my direction. The small surprise party they'd organized touched me more than they could know.

""Thank you all so much,"" I said, fighting back tears. ""Working here while finishing my degree hasn't been easy, but your support made it possible.""

Aiden approached me with an envelope. ""We're so proud of you, Hazel. But now that you've got your degree, I have to insist you start looking for opportunities in your field.""

I frowned. ""Are you firing me?""

He laughed. ""Of course not! But you're overqualified for admin work now. You deserve better.""

""But I love it here. The hours work perfectly with Leo's schedule, and everyone's been so understanding when emergencies come up.""

Aiden placed his hand on my shoulder. ""And we've loved having you. But you've worked too hard to settle.""

I nodded, knowing he was right. My business degree with a specialty in marketing operations demanded more than filing paperwork and answering phones. Leo and I deserved better.

As the party wound down, I started clearing paper plates when my phone buzzed. Chloe's name flashed on the screen.

""What's up?"" I asked, cradling the phone against my shoulder.

""Guess who just got off the phone with my dad?""

""Oscar? What did he want?"" I asked, curious. Chloe's father had always been kind to me, especially after Leo was born.

""He wants to know if you're interested in interviewing for an executive assistant position.""

I nearly dropped the stack of plates I was holding. ""At his company?""

""No, better! At Sterling Group in Haven Harbor. Dad plays golf with one of their board members. Their CEO's assistant is retiring, and they need someone exceptional to replace her.""

My mouth went dry. Sterling Group was one of the most prestigious corporations on the East Coast. ""That's... that's way out of my league, Chl.""

""No, it's not! You've basically been running Aiden's office since you started. This is perfect timing with your graduation.""

""But Haven Harbor is three hours away,"" I pointed out. ""I can't uproot Leo like that.""

""Actually..."" Chloe's voice took on that tone she used when she was about to reveal a surprise. ""Noah just got offered a position at Haven Harbor Hospital. Senior PR coordinator.""

I gasped. ""Chloe! That's amazing! Why didn't you tell me?""

""I was waiting for the right moment. And now it's here!"" She paused dramatically. ""I already found us an amazing furnished apartment with three bedrooms. One for you, one for me, and one for little Leo.""

""Us? You want us to live together?""

""Of course! And before you ask, Noah already arranged to transfer his tech job to their Haven Harbor branch. We'll all be together!""

I sank into a chair, overwhelmed. ""This is happening so fast.""

""Sometimes fast is good,"" Chloe said softly. ""Haven Harbor could be a fresh start for all of us. No more running into Ethan and Jessica at the grocery store. No more whispers from people who've known you since kindergarten.""

She was right. Ever since Ethan had cheated on me with my cousin, and even more since I'd returned from that masquerade ball pregnant, my hometown had felt suffocating with judgment.

""When's the interview?"" I asked, my decision already made.

""Tomorrow at ten. Video call with someone named Evelyn Reed.""

My heart raced. ""Tomorrow? That's so soon!""

""Fortune favors the bold, Hazel. This is your moment to shine.""

The next morning, I sat at my kitchen table in my nicest blouse, hands trembling slightly as I waited for the video call to connect. Leo was with my parents, giving me the quiet I needed.

When the screen lit up, I was faced with an elegant older woman with light blonde hair twisted into a neat bun. Her smile was warm, putting me instantly at ease.

""Miss Vance? I'm Evelyn Reed, current executive assistant to Mr. Sterling. Thank you for making time for this interview.""

""Thank you for considering me, Ms. Reed.""

She chuckled. ""Call me Evelyn, please. Now, Oscar Dalton speaks very highly of you, but I'd like to hear about your experience in your own words.""

For the next forty minutes, I detailed my work experience, education, and skills. Evelyn asked pointed questions about my organizational methods, ability to handle pressure, and experience with confidential information.

""The position is demanding,"" she explained. ""Mr. Sterling runs a tight ship and expects excellence. His schedule is packed, and you'll be responsible for managing it flawlessly. There will be late nights and occasional weekend work.""

""I understand,"" I replied, straightening my shoulders. ""I should mention that I have a three-year-old son. His care is my priority, but I'm committed to excellence in my work as well.""

I held my breath, waiting for the polite rejection that often followed this disclosure.

Instead, Evelyn smiled. ""I raised two children while working for Mr. Sterling's father. The company values work-life balance, within reason. As long as the work gets done exceptionally well, there's flexibility for family needs.""

Relief washed over me. ""That's wonderful to hear.""

""Now for the practical details,"" she continued. ""The salary is $85,000 annually with comprehensive benefits, including childcare assistance. You'd start next Monday, spending two weeks training with me before I retire.""

I nearly choked. That was more than double what I currently made.

""That sounds... that would be amazing,"" I managed.

Evelyn studied me through the screen. ""I've interviewed twelve candidates this week, Hazel. You're the only one I've offered the position to. Something tells me you're exactly what Mr. Sterling needs.""

My eyes widened. ""You're offering me the job? Now?""

""I trust my instincts. And Oscar Dalton doesn't recommend people lightly."" Her blue eyes twinkled. ""Will you accept?""

""Yes,"" I said without hesitation. ""Absolutely yes.""

""Excellent. I'll email you the paperwork today. We'll see you Monday at 8 AM sharp.""

After we disconnected, I sat in stunned silence for several minutes before calling Chloe with the news. Her excited screams almost shattered my eardrum.

Telling my parents was harder than I expected. We sat in their living room after dinner, Leo playing with blocks nearby.

""Haven Harbor?"" My mother's voice quavered. ""But that's so far away.""

""It's only three hours, Mom,"" I reminded her gently. ""And the opportunity is incredible.""

My father took my mother's hand. ""We knew this day would come, Serena. Hazel needs to build her own life.""

""But what about Leo?"" she asked, glancing at my son. ""He's so used to being here with us while you work.""

""Chloe found an apartment right near a highly-rated daycare center,"" I explained. ""And the company offers childcare assistance. He'll be well taken care of.""

""Who will watch him when he's sick?"" My mother's eyes filled with tears. ""Who will know that he likes his sandwiches cut into dinosaur shapes?""

I moved to sit beside her, wrapping my arm around her shoulders. ""I'll know, Mom. And I'll teach his caregivers. But this job means I can give him everything he deserves.""

My father cleared his throat. ""Your mother and I are just going to miss you both terribly.""

""I know,"" I whispered, my own eyes welling up. ""We'll miss you too. But we'll visit often, I promise.""

Leo looked up from his blocks, sensing the emotional atmosphere. He toddled over and climbed onto my lap.

""Mama sad?"" he asked, his extraordinary violet-blue eyes—so like his unknown father's—searching my face with concern.

""No, baby. Mama's happy,"" I assured him, kissing his forehead. ""We're going on an adventure soon.""

""Venture!"" he repeated excitedly, making us all laugh through our tears.

My father stood and pulled me into a hug, Leo squished comfortably between us. ""We're so proud of you, sweetheart. You've overcome more in three years than most people face in a lifetime.""

""We just want what's best for you both,"" my mother added, joining our embrace.

In that moment, surrounded by their love, I knew I was making the right choice. Haven Harbor would be a new beginning for Leo and me—a place where we could build our future together, without the weight of the past holding us down.

The week flew by in a flurry of packing, paperwork, and tearful goodbyes. Before I knew it, Sunday afternoon arrived, and Chloe, Noah, Leo, and I stood outside our new apartment building in Haven Harbor.

""Home sweet home!"" Chloe announced, unlocking the door with a flourish.

The apartment was spacious and bright, with large windows overlooking the harbor. True to Chloe's word, it was fully furnished with tasteful, comfortable pieces.

""This is way nicer than you described,"" I gasped, taking in the open-concept living area and gleaming kitchen.

""Only the best for my godson and best friend,"" she replied with a wink. ""Leo, want to see your room?""

My son nodded eagerly, his little hand clasped in Noah's as they followed Chloe down the hallway.

""I painted it blue like the ocean!"" Chloe called over her shoulder. ""And there might be a surprise waiting for him!""

Leo's delighted squeal moments later confirmed her hint. I found them in a charming room with ocean-blue walls and a brand new train table in the corner. Leo was already pushing a wooden engine along the tracks, completely enraptured.

""Chl, this is too much,"" I protested weakly.

She waved away my concern. ""The apartment's a steal—Dad knows the owner. And the train table is from all of us. Leo's birthday is next month anyway.""

I hugged her fiercely. ""I don't deserve you.""

""Yes, you do,"" she replied simply. ""Now go unpack. Your first day at Sterling Group is tomorrow, and you need your beauty sleep!""

Later that night, after Leo was tucked into his new bed and Chloe and Noah had retreated to their room, I unpacked my final box. At the bottom, nestled in tissue paper, was a small wooden jewelry box I'd brought from my parents' house.

I opened it carefully, revealing the contents I hadn't looked at in over three years: a delicate gold mask, a dried rose, and a nearly empty bottle of expensive perfume—mementos from the masquerade ball that had changed my life forever.

I lifted the perfume bottle, removing the stopper to catch its scent—a complex blend of amber, jasmine, and vanilla that immediately transported me back to that magical night. The night I'd felt beautiful and desirable after months of heartbreak. The night I'd fallen into the arms of a stranger with mesmerizing violet-blue eyes—eyes my son now shared.

On an impulse, I dabbed a drop behind each ear. Tomorrow marked the beginning of my new life. A fresh start. A chance to prove myself at Sterling Group.

I placed the perfume bottle on my dresser instead of returning it to the box. Perhaps it was time to stop hiding these memories away. The masquerade ball had given me Leo—the best thing in my life. I wouldn't be ashamed of that night anymore.

As I crawled into bed, the scent of the perfume enveloped me like an embrace from the past. Tomorrow I would walk into Sterling Group wearing it, a silent reminder of my strength and the beautiful life I was building, one challenge at a time.",1,1754085889.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Yankees vs. Marlins: A Tale of Pinstripes and Sunburn**  
The New York Yankees (-164) roll into Miami to face the Marlins (+138) on August 1, 2025, armed with a three-game winning streak and a batting lineup that could double as a demolition crew. Let’s break this down with the precision of a scout and the humor of a ballpark hotdog vendor who’s seen it all.

---

### Odds & Stats: The Math of Mayhem

First, the cold, hard numbers. The Yankees’ -164 moneyline implies bookmakers expect them to win \~62% of the time. For context, that’s like expecting your morning coffee to be hot—predictable, reliable, and occasionally scalding. Conversely, the Marlins’ +138 line suggests a 42% chance to shock the world (or at least the Bronx).

Historically, the Yankees thrive when favored, winning 63.8% of games with odds like these. They’re also the MLB’s third-highest scoring team, averaging 5.2 runs per game. Think of their offense as a pizza oven: relentless, hot, and likely to leave the opposition feeling like they ordered a salad instead.

The Marlins, meanwhile, have a 48.9% win rate as underdogs—a stat that defies logic, like a snow cone surviving a Florida summer. Their .252 team batting average (8th in MLB) means they can hit, but their pitching staff? Well, Janson Junk starts for Miami. His name alone feels like a cosmic omen for the Fish.

### News: Injuries, Rumors, and Why the Yankees Are Wearing “I ♥ 5 Tool Prospects” Shirts

No major injury reports here, but context is key. The Yankees are riding a wave of offensive dominance, led by Cody Bellinger (a human missile launcher) and Paul Goldschmidt (who’s here, isn’t he?). Carlos Rodon takes the mound, and while his ERA isn’t a rollercoaster, his ability to strand runners feels about as consistent as a Miami beachgoer

Chapter 14: Crosshairs and Clockhands
(Animatic & ITFT Clock POV)


---

🎯 Animatic’s POV 🎯
Moving into the lake house was the best decision ever. It was massive, echoey, kinda spooky at night, but perfect for screaming into the void when I stub my toe or feel like doing backflips at 3am. ITFT Clock said it was “a calm getaway from the madness.” Pfft. They really meant “a love nest for two absolutely unhinged goofballs.”

The view? SLAY. Sunsets? GORGEOUS. Privacy? Maximum.
Also… it had a coffee machine. Which ITFT immediately duct taped shut and wrote “DO NOT LET ANIMATIC TOUCH THIS OR THE WORLD WILL BURN” in sharpie. Rude. But fair.

That night? We did the deed. 😳 Yeah, THE deed. It was cute, a little awkward, mostly full of giggles and tickles and me whispering “beep boop” while sitting on their lap. ITFT Clock looked at me like I was the only psycho in the galaxy and I was totally fine with that.

Next morning, I felt weird. Like...weirder than usual. My crosshair was spinning in slow motion and I kept burping static. That’s when I KNEW.

I looked in the mirror and whispered, “Yo… I think I’m pregnant.”
static buzz
Nope. I didn’t think. I knew.

I told ITFT Clock and they literally froze for a full 10 seconds. Then screamed, threw glitter, and immediately started knitting baby socks (??). I said, “Her name’s gonna be Chimey,” and they cried. Loudly. For 40 minutes.


---

⏰ ITFT Clock’s POV ⏰
When Ani told me they were pregnant, I was like: “BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.” I dropped my coffee, threw my hoodie at the ceiling, and ran in circles on the porch. We were gonna be PARENTS. Parents!! Of a tiny little girl named Chimey. 🍼

Every time I thought about her, I imagined her with a little crosshair face like Ani, but ticking like me. We bought the CUTEST baby stuff—rattles shaped like hourglasses, sketchy little onesies, a rattle that sounds like static. I even built her a crib that says “GOO GOO GLITCH” on the side in LED lights. Iconic.

But Ani... oh, Ani started acting a lil funny. Not bad funny. Just, “I’m Animatic and I’m gonna canoe alone in the fall even though I’m three months pregnant and I didn’t bring a phone” funny. 😐

I woke up one morning in mid-October like, “Where’s the love of my chaotic life?” Walked around the house. Not in the kitchen. Not on the roof (yes, I checked). Not singing into the toaster like usual.

Then I saw the empty canoe. Just. Floating. In the middle of the lake.
Me: 😨


---

🎯 Animatic’s POV 🎯
Yeah, so… I may or may not have paddled out into the middle of the lake and fallen asleep in the canoe. And then… just stayed there. For a week. 😶

Pregnancy does weird stuff to me, okay?? I’m chillin’, enjoying the breeze, vibing with the loons… then BAM. Snooze mode: activated. I dreamed about static babies and waffles that screamed when you bit them. Classic.

I woke up with pine needles on my face and a squirrel chewing on my foot. “Bro,” I whispered, blinking. “Where am I?”
The answer: still in the lake. 😐

Then I saw a SECOND canoe, paddling toward me like the hero of an action movie. ITFT Clock, with a cape made of towels and a megaphone yelling, “YOU GOOD?!”

I waved weakly. “I forgot how to paddle.”


---

⏰ ITFT Clock’s POV ⏰
I paddled so fast I nearly broke the time-space continuum. Found Ani half-asleep, hair covered in moss, eyes all loopy. They looked at me like I was a mirage. I scooped them into my canoe bridal-style and whispered, “You absolute mess, I love you.”

Got them back home, fed them warm soup, tucked them in with like fifty blankets, and promised never to let them near the canoe again without supervision.
They just giggled and said, “Wanna name the second baby Dingy?” 😵‍💫

SECOND?!???


---

🎯 Animatic’s POV 🎯
Life at the lake house was chaotic, weird, beautiful. I had a baby girl on the way, a loving dork of a partner, and at least seven raccoons that broke into the pantry weekly. But most of all?

I felt loved. Glitched. Blessed. And maybe... just a little sleepy again.

I curled up on the couch with Clock, resting my head on their chest, their ticking heartbeat lulling me into dreams. “Love you,” I mumbled.

“Love you more,” they replied, stroking my static hair.

And Chimey kicked.

We both gasped.

Yeah. She’s real. And she’s gonna be awesome. 💚💙

My full question is: is there negative affects to drinking too much caffeine?

My family member (Male if that matters) drinks a lot of Mountain Dew, and recently has been drinking coffee too. For the past year, my brother has been getting Mountain Dew almost daily, and recently (past few months) he’s been getting a larger amount, to be specific he drinks a circle K Extra large cup (42oz?) with two of the larger bottle mountain dews (might be 1.25L?). Me and the rest of my family believe he has an addiction, though he claims he can drink other sodas too. Recently, my mom found her box of pod coffee to be all gone (about 24 pods) and he drank them all, after a bit of math, we realized he could hypothetically drinking around 2-5 cups a day, obviously a huge problem no doubt but does that not affect the body in anyway? He still takes naps in the day so I doubt the caffeine is really working on him now. Any help is appreciated ",1,1754085740.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I’m watching them all kind of out of order, but I started with TGWDLM because I heard it was funny and weird and I was in the mood for something musical and ridiculous tonight 😭

Like, first of all?? It’s SO funny. Like I was actually screaming laughing at some parts. The dialogue is insane. Paul is peak theatre hater energy. Emma is literally me. Like I know it’s kinda “HAHAHHAHA swearing means funny” but they did it in a way it was funny,


(I WROTE THAT HALFWAY THROUGH THE SHOW.)

…AND THEN.

AND. THEN.

No one warned me. No one said this would break me on a molecular level.

By the time I hit the second half I was just sitting there in absolute silence. Frozen. I don’t even know when the shift happened. One second it’s “cup of roasted coffee,” the next it’s existential dread, mass death, and my entire heart in pieces, but like, I was laughing through screaming tears. 

OH BILL.
I can’t even talk about Bill. He was such a good man. A good dad. He never deserved that ending. And the fact Alice would’ve died thinking her dad was the reason she suffered??? That he didn’t love her???
No. I’m not okay. I will never be okay again.

And Paul. When he came back, I was praying “oh please be Paul please be Paul,” AND IT WAS AND I SCREAMED, ACTUALLY SCREAMED..

And then he started singing.
And then it just… spiraled. Faster and darker and quieter somehow. and also, backtrack to The news podcast part thingy after the grenade hit the meteor I was sobbing. And the ending?? No hope. No saving. Just… Emma screaming at the audience 

LOWK AFTER I just sat there and cried. Full-on hour. Couldn’t move. I feel like something burrowed inside me and died there, my dad was making fun of me 💔

This show tricked me. It made me laugh and then absolutely ruined me and I’m weirdly grateful for it but also ??? F*ck me gently with a chainsaw what just happened???

Anyway… I have Black Friday and Nerdy Prudes Must Die queued next but I don’t know if I emotionally can after this lmao. Do they hurt this bad too?? Like seriously?? Should I be preparing a will???

Also — if you’ve seen TGWDLM pls tell me I’m not the only one who spiraled this hard. And if you know other musical theatre stuff that’ll destroy me in the same way, drop it below. Apparently I’m into that now.

My mom was grumpy about it, but did agree to go with me. At the front desk I didn't hear the one of the scheduler's questions, and when I asked her to repeat it my mom interrupted with ""she hasn't had her coffee today, sorry"". I'm 28, I don't need her speaking on my behalf.

Me and her got into a small tiff about tying the hospital gown(i tried to tie it myself first and was being a bit annoying about it), and since then she told every coworker that walked in how stubborn i am.

 She said it almost like she expected them to commiserate with her about how annoying i am, which they didn't. The charge even spoke up and said ""i am not aware of that, she's usually kind."" I have worked with these people for years so its no big deal, but it still felt like she wanted to shame me as much as possible. 

On the way back I was talking about how kind my coworkers are, and her only response was ""i am too"". Super weird behavior. Made me cry when I got home, which probably had something to do with the meds 😅 but still. Anybody else's mom do shit like this?

# The ""So, Now What?"" Moment

You know that feeling when you check your dashboard at 2 AM? Your SaaS app just hit 1,000 free users, and the signup graph looks like a hockey stick. Your heart pounds as you refresh the page, watching those beautiful green numbers climb. Then reality hits like a cold shower.

Your revenue? Still at $147 for the month.

You stare at this massive gap between user activity and actual money in your bank account. People are clearly using your product. They're logging in, clicking around, maybe even inviting teammates. But they're not converting. And you have absolutely no clue which ones are even close to pulling out their credit cards.

This is the modern SaaS founder's nightmare. You've built something people want to try, but you can't figure out who actually wants to pay for it. You're drowning in user data but starving for actionable insights.

Every day feels like you're playing a guessing game with your business. Which users should you focus on? Who's about to churn? Who's ready to upgrade? The spreadsheets don't tell you. Google Analytics shows you page views, not purchase intent. Your email campaigns go out to everyone because you can't tell the difference between a tire-kicker and a future champion.

# The Myth of ""If You Build It, They Will Pay""

We've all been sold on the Product-Led Growth dream. Build an amazing product, let people try it for free, and they'll naturally upgrade when they see the value. Companies like Slack, Zoom, and Notion make it look effortless. Their products are so sticky, so valuable, that users practically beg to pay for them.

But here's what those success stories don't tell you: PLG isn't magic. It's a strategy that creates a new, much harder problem. You're no longer fighting to get people to try your product. Now you're fighting to understand what the hell they're doing once they're inside.

Traditional sales was simpler. A prospect booked a demo, you talked to them for 30 minutes, and you could gauge their interest level. They either bought or they didn't. Clean, binary, understandable.

PLG turns that process into a complex web of user behaviors, feature usage patterns, and mysterious engagement metrics. Someone might use your app every day for two weeks, then disappear forever. Another user might sign up, do nothing for a month, then suddenly become your biggest advocate. Without the right tools, you're flying blind.

The harsh truth is that most founders think they're doing PLG, but they're actually just doing ""freemium without a plan."" They've opened the floodgates to free users but haven't built the infrastructure to turn those users into revenue.

# What Is Product-Led Growth, Really?

Let me break down PLG without the Silicon Valley buzzwords. Think of it like offering test drives at a car dealership. Instead of describing how smooth the engine runs, you let people feel it themselves. The product becomes your best salesperson.

But here's where the car analogy breaks down. When someone test drives a BMW, the salesperson knows exactly who they are, what they're looking for, and how interested they seem. In the digital world, you might have thousands of people ""test driving"" your product simultaneously, and you have no idea what they're thinking.

This is where the concept of a Product Qualified Lead (PQL) becomes critical. A PQL isn't just someone who signed up for your free trial. It's someone who has taken specific, meaningful actions that signal real engagement and potential purchase intent.

For a project management tool, a PQL might be someone who created three projects AND invited two teammates AND used the reporting feature. For a design tool, it might be someone who created ten designs AND exported five files AND spent more than an hour in the app across multiple sessions.

The magic happens when you can identify these behavioral patterns and then act on them automatically. When someone hits that golden combination of actions, they get different treatment. Maybe they receive a personal email from you as the founder. Maybe they see a special upgrade offer. Maybe a customer success person reaches out to see how they're doing.

But first, you need to know who these people are. And that's where most founders get stuck.

# What Is PLG OS? The 10,000-Foot View

PLG OS positions itself as the ""operating system"" for product-led growth. That's not just marketing speak. The name reflects its ambition to be the central hub where you manage your entire PLG strategy.

Think of it as the mission control center for your user journey. Every time someone clicks, scrolls, signs up, or engages with your product, PLG OS is watching and learning. It's collecting all those individual actions and building a complete picture of how each user interacts with your product.

But data collection is just the foundation. The real power comes from what PLG OS does with that information. It helps you define what ""good user behavior"" looks like for your specific product, then automatically identifies when users match those patterns. Once you've identified your most promising users, it lets you engage with them in personalized, automated ways.

[**Start Your PLG OS Journey Today**](https://softtechhub.us/PLG%20OS)

PLG OS handles three core jobs:

**See Everything**: It consolidates all user actions into one place, giving you a single source of truth for how people use your product.

**Find the Best**: It provides visual tools to define what a ""best user"" looks like based on their behavior, creating dynamic segments that update in real-time.

**Act Automatically**: It lets you set up ""Playbooks"" that automatically message users when they hit key milestones or show specific patterns.

This isn't just another analytics tool or email platform. It's a specialized system designed specifically for the unique challenges of product-led growth. Where Google Analytics shows you aggregate data and Mailchimp sends time-based emails, PLG OS connects user behavior directly to personalized engagement.

# The Features You'll Actually Use

# The Unified Customer Profile

Setting up PLG OS starts with installing a simple code snippet on your website or app. Once that's live, something remarkable happens. Every single interaction a user has with your product gets captured and organized into a unified profile.

This isn't like looking at Google Analytics where you see anonymous sessions and bounce rates. This is a complete, chronological story of each individual user's journey. You can see exactly when they signed up, which features they tried first, how long they spent in each section, and what actions led them to upgrade or churn.

The profile view becomes addictive once you start using it. You'll find yourself clicking through different users, spotting patterns you never noticed before. You might discover that users who watch your onboarding video are 3x more likely to invite teammates. Or that people who use your search feature in their first session have much higher retention rates.

This level of individual insight transforms how you think about your users. They stop being abstract metrics and become real people with specific behaviors and preferences.

# The PQL & Segment Builder

This is where PLG OS really shines. The segment builder uses a visual, drag-and-drop interface that lets you create complex user segments without writing any code.

Let's say you run a productivity app. You might create a PQL segment with these criteria:

* Created more than 5 tasks
* Invited at least 1 teammate
* Used the app on 3+ different days
* Clicked on a premium feature

Once you save this segment, PLG OS automatically monitors all your users and adds them to the ""PQL"" group when they match these criteria. The segments are dynamic, so they update in real-time as user behavior changes.

You can create as many segments as you want. Maybe you have a ""At Risk of Churning"" segment for engaged users who haven't logged in for 7 days. Or a ""Power User"" segment for people who've used your product for 50+ hours. Each segment becomes a tool for understanding and engaging different types of users.

The visual builder makes this process intuitive. You're not writing SQL queries or struggling with complex formulas. You're simply selecting behaviors from dropdown menus and combining them with ""AND"" or ""OR"" logic.

# Automation with Playbooks

Segments are valuable, but they become powerful when connected to actions. This is where Playbooks come in. A Playbook is a simple ""when this happens, do that"" automation.

Here are some practical Playbook examples:

**The Onboarding Nudge**: When a user signs up but doesn't complete their profile within 24 hours, send them an email with a link to a quick setup guide.

**The PQL Hand-Raiser**: When a user enters your ""PQL"" segment, trigger an in-app message from you as the founder saying, ""Hey \[Name\], I noticed you're getting great value from \[specific feature they use most\]. I'd love to hear about your experience!""

**The Pre-Churn Intervention**: When a power user hasn't logged in for 10 days, send them a personalized email highlighting new features they haven't tried yet.

**The Upgrade Prompt**: When someone hits your freemium limits (like creating their 10th project), show them a contextual upgrade message explaining how the paid plan removes those limits.

The key is that these messages are triggered by behavior, not just time. They're contextually relevant because they're based on what the user actually did, not where they are in some arbitrary email sequence.

# Contextual Engagement

PLG OS handles both email and in-app messaging, but what makes it special is the context. Because it knows exactly what each user has done, it can personalize messages in ways that generic email tools can't match.

Instead of sending a generic ""Here are our features!"" email, you can send ""I noticed you've created 8 projects in the last week. Here's a quick tip for organizing them with our tagging feature.""

The in-app messages are even more powerful because they appear at exactly the right moment. When someone clicks on a premium feature they can't access, they see a targeted upgrade message. When they complete an important action, they get immediate positive reinforcement.

This level of personalization creates experiences that feel almost magical to users. They get the sense that your product understands them and their specific needs.

# The AppSumo Deal: Analyzing the Lifetime Offer

AppSumo is offering PLG OS as a lifetime deal with four different tiers. Here's the breakdown:

**License Tier 1 ($79)**: 1,000 monthly tracked users, 2 components, 2 integrations **License Tier 2 ($119)**: 2,000 monthly tracked users, 4 components, 4 integrations  
**License Tier 3 ($239)**: 4,000 monthly tracked users, 6 components, 6 integrations **License Tier 4 ($399)**: 6,000 monthly tracked users, 10 components, 10 integrations

All tiers include UI campaign analytics, webhooks and alerts, custom events, custom attributes, custom feature flags, audience segmentation, and UI variants.

Let's do the math on this deal. Most comparable tools in this space charge $100-500+ per month. Even if PLG OS eventually prices at $150/month (which would be reasonable for this type of platform), the Tier 1 lifetime deal pays for itself in less than one month of regular pricing.

For a bootstrapped founder, this cash flow difference is massive. Instead of adding another $150-300 monthly recurring expense to your burn rate, you pay once and never worry about it again. That's the difference between having 6 extra months of runway or not.

The lifetime deal model does come with risks. The company could fail, or lifetime deal customers might not get access to future premium features. But for early-stage founders, the potential reward far outweighs these risks. You're getting access to enterprise-level growth infrastructure for the price of a good dinner.

# Is PLG OS For You?

**You should get PLG OS if:**

* You run a SaaS, web app, or mobile app with a free trial or freemium model
* You have at least a few hundred users generating behavioral data
* You believe in product-led growth but don't have a huge budget for complex tools
* You're a founder, marketer, or product person who wants hands-on control over growth
* You're tired of guessing which users are most likely to convert
* You want to automate user engagement without hiring a full sales team

**You should probably skip PLG OS if:**

* You run an e-commerce site, blog, or service-based business
* You don't have a self-serve digital product
* You have zero user signups yet (it's too early to worry about conversion optimization)
* You prefer talking to every user individually rather than using automation

The sweet spot for PLG OS is the founder or small team that has product-market fit but needs help turning users into revenue. If you're getting signups but struggling with conversion, this tool directly addresses your biggest challenge.

# Real User Feedback and Results

Based on reviews from early users, PLG OS is delivering solid results. Users have reported +20–40% lift in activation and engagement rates after implementing the platform. The feedback consistently highlights two main strengths: the speed of implementation and the intuitive user interface.

PLG OS is a solid platform for enhancing product-led growth strategies. It offers intuitive user flows, insightful analytics, and smooth integrations that help businesses drive user activation and retention. The UI is clean and easy to navigate, making it accessible for teams of all sizes.

Really impressed with Plgos! The platform offers a seamless onboarding experience and innovative features that keep users engaged. The gamification elements add a fun twist to user interactions, making it easier to gather feedback.

One particularly compelling aspect is Launch your first onboarding or engagement flow in under an hour. This speed advantage is critical for startup teams that need to move fast and test ideas quickly.

The platform integrates with popular tools and services, making it easy to fit into existing workflows. The founder mentions integrations with OpenAI, Supabase, Stripe, and other modern development tools, suggesting the platform is built with current tech stacks in mind.

# The Technical Foundation

PLG OS runs on solid technical infrastructure. MongoDB Atlas on AWS – US East (N. Virginia) \[us-east-1\] handles data storage, providing enterprise-level security and reliability. The platform supports webhooks, custom events, and API integrations, giving developers the flexibility they need while maintaining the no-code simplicity for non-technical users.

The security considerations are important for any tool handling user data. While specific security certifications aren't detailed in the available information, the use of established platforms like AWS and MongoDB Atlas suggests professional security practices.

For compliance-conscious businesses, the US-based data storage and global availability make PLG OS suitable for companies operating in various regulatory environments.

# Comparing PLG OS to Alternatives

The product-led growth tool space includes several established players like Intercom, Mixpanel, and Amplitude. PLG OS differentiates itself through its focus on speed and simplicity.

Where enterprise tools often require weeks of setup and technical implementation, PLG OS promises deployment in minutes. Where complex analytics platforms show you what happened, PLG OS focuses on automating what happens next.

The all-in-one approach is also distinctive. Instead of stitching together separate tools for analytics, messaging, and user segmentation, PLG OS handles everything in one platform. This reduces complexity and eliminates the integration headaches that plague multi-tool stacks.

The pricing model through AppSumo makes PLG OS accessible to bootstrapped startups that couldn't afford enterprise alternatives. A tool like Intercom can easily cost $500-1000+ per month for growing companies, making the PLG OS lifetime deal extremely attractive by comparison.

[**Secure Your PLG OS Access Before the Deal Ends**](https://softtechhub.us/PLG%20OS)

# Implementation Strategy

Getting started with PLG OS requires some strategic thinking about your user journey. Before you install the tracking code, spend time identifying the key actions that indicate user engagement in your specific product.

For different types of SaaS products, these indicators vary:

**Project Management Tools**: Creating projects, inviting team members, using collaboration features **Design Software**: Creating designs, exporting files, using advanced features  
**Analytics Platforms**: Connecting data sources, creating dashboards, sharing reports **Communication Tools**: Sending messages, creating channels, adding integrations

The goal is to identify the actions that correlate with long-term retention and conversion. These become the building blocks for your PQL definitions and automated playbooks.

Start simple with 2-3 key behaviors, then expand your tracking as you learn more about your users. The visual segment builder makes it easy to iterate and refine your definitions over time.

# The Learning Curve

One advantage of PLG OS is its relatively gentle learning curve. The no-code interface means non-technical team members can create segments and set up automations without developer help.

That said, the most effective use of the platform requires understanding your users and their journey. You'll get better results if you invest time in analyzing user behavior patterns before setting up complex automations.

The platform includes analytics dashboards to help you understand which segments are performing well and which automations are driving results. This feedback loop helps you continuously improve your PLG strategy.

# Future Considerations

In the future, we may offer premium add-ons (like advanced AI modeling or team-level orchestration), but everything you need to ship high-quality in-app experiences is included in this deal.

This transparency about future pricing is helpful for planning. While premium features may eventually require additional payment, the core functionality needed for most PLG strategies is included in the lifetime deal.

The platform's roadmap appears focused on adding more sophisticated automation and AI-powered insights. For lifetime deal purchasers, this means your investment should become more valuable over time as new features are added to the base platform.

# Final Thoughts

PLG OS isn't a magic wand that creates growth out of thin air. It's a systematic approach to understanding and engaging your users based on their actual behavior. The platform gives you the clarity and automation tools to act on insights you're probably already seeing in your user data.

**The Pros:**

* Laser focus on solving one hard problem extremely well
* The no-code PQL builder makes complex segmentation accessible
* The AppSumo lifetime deal offers exceptional value for early-stage companies
* Fast implementation means you can start seeing results quickly
* All-in-one approach eliminates the need for multiple tools

**The Cons:**

* Your success depends entirely on your ability to identify meaningful user behaviors

For a founder in 2025, your most valuable assets are time and focus. PLG OS is designed to save you both by automating the process of identifying and nurturing your most promising users. It's a serious tool for founders who want to build a systematic growth engine from day one, rather than hoping that good users will somehow reveal themselves.

The lifetime deal makes this decision easier. At $79 for the base tier, you're essentially getting enterprise-level user intelligence for less than most founders spend on coffee in a month. Even if PLG OS only helps you convert 5-10 additional users over the next year, it pays for itself many times over.

The question isn't whether PLG OS is perfect. The question is whether you can afford to keep guessing about which of your users are ready to pay you.

Maybe spoilers idk,"Okay so… no real reason for this post other than I LOVE Starkid and I just started getting into their shows. I’m watching them all kind of out of order, but I started with TGWDLM because I heard it was funny and weird and I was in the mood for something musical and ridiculous tonight 😭

Like, first of all?? It’s SO funny. Like I was actually screaming laughing at some parts. The dialogue is insane. Paul is peak theatre hater energy. Emma is literally me. Like I know it’s kinda “HAHAHHAHA swearing means funny” but they did it in a way it was funny,


(I WROTE THAT HALFWAY THROUGH THE SHOW.)

…AND THEN.

AND. THEN.

No one warned me. No one said this would break me on a molecular level.

By the time I hit the second half I was just sitting there in absolute silence. Frozen. I don’t even know when the shift happened. One second it’s “cup of roasted coffee,” the next it’s existential dread, mass death, and my entire heart in pieces, but like, I was laughing through screaming tears. 

OH BILL.
I can’t even talk about Bill. He was such a good man. A good dad. He never deserved that ending. And the fact Alice would’ve died thinking her dad was the reason she suffered??? That he didn’t love her???
No. I’m not okay. I will never be okay again.

And Paul. When he came back, I was praying “oh please be Paul please be Paul,” AND IT WAS AND I SCREAMED, ACTUALLY SCREAMED..

And then he started singing.
And then it just… spiraled. Faster and darker and quieter somehow. and also, backtrack to The news podcast part thingy after the grenade hit the meteor I was sobbing. And the ending?? No hope. No saving. Just… Emma screaming at the audience 

LOWK AFTER I just sat there and cried. Full-on hour. Couldn’t move. I feel like something burrowed inside me and died there, my dad was making fun of me 💔

This show tricked me. It made me laugh and then absolutely ruined me and I’m weirdly grateful for it but also ??? F*ck me gently with a chainsaw what just happened???

Anyway… I have Black Friday and Nerdy Prudes Must Die queued next but I don’t know if I emotionally can after this lmao. Do they hurt this bad too?? Like seriously?? Should I be preparing a will???

Also — if you’ve seen TGWDLM pls tell me I’m not the only one who spiraled this hard. And if you know other musical theatre stuff that’ll destroy me in the same way, drop it below. Apparently I’m into that now.

I found the first letter stuck under my doormat when I got home. Not slipped in the mail slot or dropped on the porch like when I normally get mail, but jammed under the mat like it was waiting for me. The envelope was sealed, and had my name on the front, so at first I assumed it was a that bill I had forgotten about. 

But it wasn't.

Inside the envelope was a single piece of paper, with edges a little torn like someone didn’t care. Handwriting all jagged, like a kid learning cursive but desperate to be serious.

“Don’t ignore the signs at work.” 

That’s all it said. No signature. No return address.

I thought about it for longer than I should have, sitting in the living room in the dark starting at the paper. Was it someone from work messing with me? Possible, but I couldn't imagine who. Eventually I convinced myself to stop thinking about it, and move on. After all, it could be anything. 

The next day at the office was the same old same old. The building always smelled like burnt coffee and old carpet, stale air that stuck in your throat. You could almost feel the gray walls closing in a little tighter.

I’m a credit controller. Which means most of my job is just chasing clients for money they're already two weeks late on, acting polite while internally praying they go bankrupt so I can be free.

Most of the day was uneventful. My boss wore a horrible tie with dinosaurs on it, and asked me if I liked it. The new intern got caught filling the printer the wrong way. Around 11 a.m. I caught Jenna standing by the filing cabinet, half-leaning against it with her phone in one hand, scrolling. She was smiling at something. Then she laughed quietly to herself, or maybe it was more like a giggle. She looked up, saw me looking, and we just held that weird eye contact for a second too long.

I looked away first.

Instantly, that crawling feeling crept up my spine again. She’d laughed right after looking at me. Was that about me? Was she behind the letter? Was I being messed with?

Before I could spiral, she was suddenly next to my desk, catching me off guard.

“Hey,” she said, a little breathless. “Do you have a sec? I’m losing my mind over these Acorn Media invoices. No one's been answering over there. I’ve called them, like, four times this week.”

She held out a little stack of paper. I tried to focus, but my brain was still running in loops. I nodded and took the pages.

“Yeah,” I said. “They’ve been dodging. I might escalate it.”

She sighed. “Honestly? Sometimes I feel like just writing a handwritten note and mailing it to them. Like, Dear Sir, pay the damn bill.”

She smiled as she said it. Like it was a joke. But my stomach dropped.

This is the exact kind of thing someone would say if they were testing how I’d react. Or covering their tracks.

I laughed, but it didn’t sound like me. “Yeah. Old school.”

Inside, I felt something shift.

I got home around six. Keys dropped in the bowl, jacket thrown over the back of the chair like always. I stood in the kitchen eating peanut butter off a spoon, scrolling on my phone, trying not to think about work.

But I kept replaying what Jenna said. The handwritten note thing. It sat wrong in my head, like something caught between my teeth. Not just what she said but the way she had said it. That look she gave me after.

I finally went to take the trash out, and that’s when I saw it.

Another envelope.

Same as before. No stamp. No markings. Just my name in that same twitchy handwriting. This time it wasn’t under the mat, but stuck halfway inside the crack of the screen door. Like whoever left it had no time to hide it properly.

I didn’t open it right away. Just stared at it while the trash bag swung in my other hand, cold sweat starting to collect at my neck. Eventually, I took it inside and opened it over the sink.

One sheet of paper again.

This one said:

""You handled the Jenna thing well. Don’t second-guess it. Stay confident.""

I dropped it instantly like it burned.

There was no way that was coincidence. Not anymore.

I checked all the windows. The locks. Even the weird spot in the hallway ceiling where the plaster’s chipped that I always told myself I’d fix but never did. My phone was in my pocket the whole time at work. No one could’ve seen that conversation unless—

I didn’t even finish the thought.

I stood there in my kitchen, holding the note in two fingers like it might bite me, and I thought: Either this is some next-level prank, or someone is watching me a lot closer than I thought.

The next morning crawled.

I was jittery, for no good reason. Kept looking up from my screen, stealing glances at Jenna like I was waiting for her to… what? Confront me? Smile? Say something weird?

She didn’t notice. Not at first.

She was too busy arguing with someone over the phone. Voice raised, eyebrows pulled together, fingers drumming hard against her desk.

“I’m not chasing this again, David,” she snapped. “I already sent the invoice twice, and your assistant keeps telling me she’s on holiday. It’s been six weeks.”

“No, it doesn't matter what your supervisor says. These payments were already cleared by your head of finance, speaking of is he in?.” 

That's when she glanced over at me. A pause. She rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might fall out.

I quickly got up, grabbed my mug like I just remembered I was parched, and awkwardly shuffled toward the coffee room.

The second I stepped in, it hit me how small it really was. Half-lit by a jittery fluorescent tube. That stale instant-coffee smell cooked into the walls. I stood near the sink, trying to look busy while my pulse thudded behind my eyes.

Not thirty seconds later, the door creaked open.

Jenna walked in holding her phone loosely like it might bite her. She dropped it face down on the counter.

“You ever just… want to launch yourself out a window?” she muttered.

I gave a half-laugh, too quick, like I didn’t know if it was okay.

She started fixing her coffee. Powder, water, stir. I couldn’t stop myself.

“Honestly?” I said, “Yeah. But if I did, probably notfrom this office as it's only 5 stories. I’d probably just bounce off the second-floor awning and end up with a broken leg. The guys next door at Jpact have a ten story building, so probably that would give me a better chance.

She looked at me.

Not laughing. Not smiling.

“Jesus,” she said, a little too flat. “That’s dark.”

I tried to recover. “I meant like, you know—corporate hell. It’s a joke.”

“Right.”

Silence.

The spoon clinked once, twice, then she put it down gently and picked up her cup.

“Well. See you out there,” she said, already halfway out the door.

I stood alone in the hum of the fridge, feeling like I’d tripped on my own tongue and fell face-first into whatever tension had just filled the room.

I found the third one in the jacket I wore yesterday.

Not in the pocket. Not on the floor.
Folded neatly into the inside lining, where the stitching had come loose a week ago and I hadn’t bothered to fix it.

I only noticed it because I went to grab gum. My fingers brushed paper where paper shouldn't be.

It was an envelope.
Sealed.
Same kind as before, cheap, off-white, the glue barely holding.
And on the front, in that same crooked cursive, was my name.

No one else lives here.
I didn’t leave the jacket out in public.
And I sure as hell didn’t put anything in it.

I stood there by the door for a full minute, jacket half-on, envelope in hand, heart kicking like a warning.

Eventually I opened it.

Same kind of paper. Same jagged writing.

“Don’t joke about death. You’re not ready for that yet.
Say something lighter. Try:
‘At this point I think the invoices are chasing me.
I had a dream one of them cornered me in the stairwell.’
She’ll laugh. Nod. Let her talk after that.”

No signature. No smudge. Just that same sense of something leaning in too close.

I read it twice. Then a third time.

And the worst part?

It was good.
The joke. The rhythm. It sounded like me. but sharper. Like someone who had already seen the conversation play out and just decided to hand me the cheat codes.

I didn’t plan to speak to her again. I figured I’d burned that bridge in the coffee room.

But the day after, near the end of lunch, I heard her voice again. Loud, muffled by the headset, then sharp—“No, I told you that one was paid in June. If your system says otherwise, then your system’s a piece of sh—”

She slammed the headset down on her desk, rubbed her forehead, and sighed so hard I felt it from two cubicles away.

I glanced up. Mistake.

She caught me looking.

Our eyes met and this time there was no knowing smirk. Just something tense and unreadable. She blinked slowly, like she was chewing through some internal comment, and looked away.

I froze, then forced myself to stand.

I walked toward the break room with the gait of someone pretending to be normal. Once inside, I busied myself rinsing a mug that was already clean. My hands shook. My skin felt too loud.

Behind me, the door creaked. 

She entered quietly, phone dangling from her fingers again, unreadable. I turned to say something, anything, her expression was brittle, still tight from the call.

 “Rough day?” I tried.

“No,” she said. Then immediately: “Yes. I don’t know. I think I’ve lost the ability to talk to adults without sounding like I want to bite them.”

She gave a small laugh. I didn’t.

The silence stretched. I could feel it turning sour again. My mind spun. I felt cornered.
Like I’d been caught trespassing in my own body.

Then I remembered the line.

“I had this dream last night,” I blurted out, too loud. “That one of the unpaid invoices chased me down the stairwell and pinned me against the wall. 

She blinked. Then snorted.

Then laughed.

 “what like a giant piece of paper chased you down and pinned you against a wall? What happened then?”



“It... Uh... Told me it was going to make me pay for once.""


Now she was full-on giggling. She leaned back against the counter, shook her head.

 “You’re weird,” she said. “But, like… not in a murder-y way. I think that’s a compliment.”

She paused, looked at me sideways.

“You wanna get a drink tomorrow? After the invoice monsters clock out?”

My heart skipped a little. I wasn't expecting this. I nodded, maybe a little too fast.

 “Yeah sure that could be fun, I’d like that.”

“Cool,” she said, already turning. “I’ll text you.”

 I stayed there, holding the mug like a weapon, heartbeat pulsing in my ears. If it was her sending the letters, why would she tell me what kind of jokes to make? Was this all an elaborate plan for her to get me to go out with her? She could have just asked without all this.

That night, the apartment was locked. Same as always. Nothing looked disturbed. But when I stepped into the living room, there it was.

On my coffee table.

The envelope.

This one was different. Expensive, textured card. Like it came from a wedding invitation set.

I picked it up, and my stomach did that thing again. like the air had turned to static and all the oxygen got vacuumed out of the room.

The handwriting was worse this time. Harsher. Jagged.

Like it had been written in the dark, with a shaking hand. And instead of black ink like before, it was red. 

Inside, it said:

""Cancel the drink. Tell her your cat is sick. Say it like it’s sad, but don’t overdo it. ""

I don’t have a cat. 

The next day, things felt weird from the second I sat down.

I couldn’t focus. Couldn’t even pretend to. My fingers hovered above the keyboard for an hour, typing nothing. I reread the letter three times before leaving the apartment that morning. Each time, the words seemed more aggressive.

Around 2PM, Jenna appeared at my desk.

She was holding her phone and smiling, and not that weird strained smile from before. A real one.

“So what time you wanna head out tonight? Six-thirty too early?”

My stomach locked up. I looked at her like a deer trying to solve math.

“Ah… I might have to, um…” I forced a cough. “My cat’s sick. This morning she wouldn’t eat and she was just lying there, so I think I need to, like… take her to the vet.”

The moment I said it, something in her face changed.

Like someone had pulled a string behind her eyes.
 “Your cat is sick?” she said.

Not surprised. Not sympathetic. Startled.

I nodded, too committed now.

“Yeah. She's usually okay but this morning was… different. Just being careful.”

Jenna didn’t respond right away. Her gaze had drifted past me, like she was trying to remember something and couldn’t place it.

Then she smiled again—but this one was off. Half-hearted. Like she’d just lost track of why she came over.

“Oh. Okay. Yeah, no, totally. We’ll just… do another time then.”

She turned and walked away without another word.

No sarcastic jab. No joke about invoice monsters. Nothing.

And as she moved back toward her desk, I saw her glance over her shoulder.

Not at me. At the hallway behind me.

Like someone else might’ve been standing there.

I got home fast.

Didn’t stop for groceries. Didn’t check the mail. Barely remembered to lock the door. Just dumped my bag and started scanning the apartment like it might breathe at me.

No letter.

I checked the kitchen table.

Nothing.

Under the door?

Clear.

My bed. Under the pillow. The sink. The freezer. The window ledge. The fucking microwave.

Nothing.

And then—
my phone buzzed.

JENNA CALLING.

I stared at the screen. I almost didn’t pick up.

Then I did.

“Hello?”

Her voice came fast, trembling, and angry.

 “What the fuck is this?”

I swallowed.

“What?”

“What the fuck is wrong with you?”

“Jenna—wait, I don’t—”

 “Are you some kind of sick freak?” she snapped. “Do you think this is funny?”

 “I don’t know what you’re talking about—”

 “Are you sending letters to my fucking house?.”

The room went dead quiet around me.

“What?”

 “Yesterday,” she said, her voice suddenly smaller. Tighter. “Before today. Before you said anything. I got a letter. At my place.”

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t.

 “It was just one sentence,” she said.


 “It said: You don’t have a cat.”


 “I don’t,” I said quietly.

Silence.

Then, more quietly she replied.

 “I know you don’t. That’s why it scared the shit out of me.”

I sat down on the floor. My heart was going somewhere else without me.

“That’s not it,” she said. “There was another letter. Waiting for me when I got home.”

 “Did you open it?”

 “No. Not yet.”

I closed my eyes.

 “Open it,” I said. “Tell me what it says.”

I heard her rustling paper on the other end.

Then nothing.

Then just—

 “It says... Oh my god. It says hang up the phone.”

Before I could even register what she had just said, the line dropped. 

That was three days ago.
I’ve been calling in sick to work ever since.

I haven’t left the apartment.

With AquaBee, I wanted to create something simple but smarter, using science backed hydration values (mainly based on Maughan 2016) so you can log any drink, water, tea, milk, juice, even coffee, and actually know how much it's helping you hydrate.

**10. Danone Sues Chobani Over Alleged Packaging and Slogan Copycat**

Danone is taking Chobani to court, claiming it copied the slogan and packaging design of its STōK cold brew coffee for La Colombe products. The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan, alleges that Chobani's “Bright & Flavorful” branding is too close to Danone’s “Bright & Mellow,” potentially misleading rushed consumers and damaging Danone’s trademark. The issue isn’t just about words—Danone argues the new packaging (including color scheme and roast description) deliberately mimics STōK, constituting ""knowing, calculated, and systematic"" infringement. This follows a similar case where Mondelēz sued Aldi for allegedly copying packaging for snacks like Oreo and Ritz, raising larger questions about trade dress, brand identity, and private-label lookalikes.

**14. US Honey Consumption Hits Record High in 2024 — Up 25% Since 2023**

US honey consumption reached a new record in 2024, hitting **688.6 million pounds**, which is a 25% jump compared to 2023! This beats the previous high of 618 million pounds set in 2021. The surge is mainly due to honey’s image as a natural “superfood” and healthier alternative to table sugar. People love its flavor and the health benefits it offers. Margaret Lombard, CEO of the National Honey Board, points out that choosing honey also supports beekeepers and the vital role honey bees play in pollinating our food ecosystem.

**15. APR & ReMA Update Recycled Plastic Bale Specs to Match Current Tech and Trading Practices**

The Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR) and the Recycled Materials Association (ReMA) in the US just released updated specifications for recycled plastic bales. These updates aim to better align with the latest North American trading practices and recycling technologies. The changes were approved by both organizations’ boards and reflect ongoing efforts to improve plastic recycling quality and market consistency. This is a big step for the circular plastics industry as it helps ensure recycled materials meet current industry demands and supports smoother trading across the supply chain.

**16. Neste and Ravago Abandon Plans for Chemical Recycling Plant in the Netherlands**

Finnish chemical recycler Neste and Belgian materials supplier Ravago have dropped their plans to build a pyrolysis (chemical recycling) plant in Vlissingen, Netherlands. The project, announced back in 2021, aimed to process 55,000 tons of mixed plastic waste annually using technology from Alterra Energy (an Ohio-based company in which both have minority stakes). A Neste spokesperson confirmed the project didn’t reach final investment decision readiness and has now been discontinued. Neste and Ravago initially partnered in 2019 to chemically recycle over 200,000 tons of plastic waste per year. Neste currently processes around 6,000 tons of liquefied waste plastic annually at its Porvoo refinery in Finland, with plans to scale this to 150,000 tons yearly via a €111 million investment. They also hold European rights to Alterra’s liquefaction tech, but no new facilities have been built yet. Neste’s long-term goal is to process over 1 million tons of waste plastic per year by 2030.

Disclaimer : Lengthy Post. Definately Helpful.

Is it Possible To Manifest SP against ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ?? 3P situation..No Contact for Years. Living in Different Countries.. SP told You they don't love you or whatever. 

My answer is YES. 
IT'S 💯 POSSIBLE TO MANIFEST SP Mo matter what You are facing or seeing in your reality. 

I myself Manifested my SP against all circumstances. Against all odds. Not even single situation or circumstance was in my favour. Still I Manifested my SP. 

Question is How I did it ?

It's simple to answer but quite difficult to understand n implement.

Soo here is my story and Guidance to get Your SP. 

Here is the Complete Story. ( Going to be lengthy but it ll help you to understand the complete journey ) 

I had a breakup with my ex-girlfriend in 2019.
I was shattered, but then I decided that I would attract a girl who was more beautiful and more loving than my ex.
I was very specific about the kind of partner I wanted.
I wrote down every detail I desired in my future partner her looks, aesthetics, behavior, nature, skin color, name, height, physique  everything.

Then I performed an imaginal act, as if I had already found my ideal partner. After that, I let it go; I didn’t obsess over it.
I did this exercise just for fun in March 2019. I still remember it clearly.

A few weeks later, I saw a girl from a distance, and I felt like she was the one.
Then I prayed to God, saying, “Please, I want to know her. Do something  I just want to meet her once.”

I forgot about her and the prayers I had made in that moment.
A few weeks later, I received a follow request on Instagram from a girl. When I checked her profile, I realized she was the exact same girl I had seen a few weeks ago.

She even messaged me, saying, “Do we really know each other?”
I was like, Damn!
Then we started talking. Slowly, I began to realize that she was the exact same girl I had imagined during that fun exercise  the same aesthetics, the same height, the same traits. It felt like I had crafted her out of a raw mold.

But as we continued talking, it became clear that it was a one-way conversation. She wasn’t responding the way I had hoped  her replies were cold and distant.
Eventually, I found out that she had been in a relationship with a guy for the past 5–6 years.

Then I had a desire to meet her.
We met twice, just for an hour each time, over coffee. The conversations were normal and casual.

But for me, it was a win  almost like a miracle. I had wanted to meet her, and I did. That experience gave me a boost and confidence that there’s something magical about these higher forces.

The very next day, she moved to a different city.
After that, she got busy with her life, and we barely spoke over text.

That’s when I started exploring the Law of Attraction.
(I didn’t know about the Law of Assumption or Neville Goddard’s teachings on manifestation back in 2019.)
The only thing I knew was: “Imagine that person with you in the present moment. Feel it as real, and feel good  just for the sake of the experience.” 

That was the only thing I knew about the Law of Attraction.
(I wasn’t aware of third-party situations, no-contact phases, self-concept, affirmations, or the SAT technique.)

The only thing I knew was: “Imagine that person with you now, and feel as if it’s real.”

So, whenever I had a desire to talk to her or be with her, I would imagine having a loving conversation with her.
If I was sitting at a coffee shop and missing her, I would simply imagine her sitting next to me, holding my hand and loving me.
If I was having dinner, I’d imagine she was the one who cooked it and was feeding me with love.
If I was working out at the gym, I would imagine her helping me with the workout, taking gym pictures with me, as if we were doing it all together.

So basically, I just wanted to feel good as if she was with me now. I focused on my imagination and treated it as if it were real.

I was internally living in my imagination  as if we were already dating and in a loving relationship.

Now, the most important part: how did I ignore the third-party situation, the no-contact phase, and the fact that she was in a different city?

To be honest, it never really bothered me  because my ultimate goal was to feel good in the present moment. I chose to ignore everything else, as if it didn’t matter.

Third-party situation? I knew that couples break up eventually  it’s a very normal thing. I had gone through a breakup myself after a 4–5 year relationship, so I understood how common it is.
I didn’t focus on her boyfriend at all. I simply enjoyed the imagined scenes where she was my girlfriend, and I was her boyfriend  the best thing that ever happened to her. And she loved me deeply.

Period.

I did this exercise for a few months until around September or October 2019.
After that, she moved to her hometown with her boyfriend (a live-in relationship situation).
Then the pandemic happened.

To be honest, I lost hope. I was tired of doing the imagination scenes  my mind felt saturated with the idea that I already had my girlfriend. So I reached a point where I didn’t feel like doing any more imagination techniques. I was done.
(Neville Goddard calls this the Sabbath state  the state of wish fulfilled.)

I got busy with my own life. I deleted all my social media. I even deleted her contact.
Why? Because I had lost all hope and wasn’t expecting anything to happen.
I wasn’t expecting any outcome at all, simply because I didn’t know if these things actually worked or manifested in real life.

All I had wanted was to feel good  and I did.
Then, I let everything go.

After some time, I completely forgot about her. She was living her life, and I was living mine.

One and a half years later 

It was October 2021.
Out of nowhere, I received a call from an unknown number.
Guess what? It was the same girl.

She said, “I’ve moved back to your city  let’s meet.”

I was like, Holy f**... she still has my number?*
She literally called me after a year and a half?

At first, I thought maybe she had just moved back for work or something.
Then we started meeting more often.
And after some time, she proposed to me  and we started dating.

During this time, everything began to unfold exactly as I had imagined back in 2019.
The moment she pulled me in and kissed me, I realized  I had imagined this exact scene before.
Her waking up next to me... holding hands... walking down the street on a cold winter night, cuddling under a blanket... cooking dinner for me... washing my clothes...

I was like, Wait a second. Is this really happening?
It felt surreal as if I had already lived this in my imagination, and now I was experiencing it in physical reality.

Not gonna lie every single thing I had once imagined was replicated exactly as it was.

That’s when I truly started believing in the Law of Attraction.
I began studying it more deeply, and eventually, I came across the Law of Assumption.

Then I realized I had actually been practicing the Law of Assumption all along.
Telling myself: “She is my girlfriend. We are in a relationship. We are living together.”

Imagination was just the technique  the tool I used to assume my desired reality.

We all wonder what’s happening behind the scenes, especially when we don’t see any movement in the physical reality.
Instead, we often see the opposite of what we desire.

We see our SP (specific person) with a 3P (third party).
We see them going on trips, romantic dates, and sharing happy moments.
Right?

And then we start questioning:
""How is it even possible to manifest? I’m seeing no movement. I can literally see my SP with someone else. They look happy. My SP is in a different city. We haven’t spoken in months.""

All those negative thoughts start creeping in.

So, I started digging deeper.
Out of curiosity, I began asking her questions  I wanted to understand what actually happened during those two years we were apart behind the scenes.

I asked,
“How was your relationship during those two years of the pandemic, when you were living together?”
(Why did I ask that? Because I had assumed they must have been happy together  enjoying a romantic, loving time.)

But her response shocked me.

She said,
“We were just living under the same roof. My boyfriend was always occupied with work. He hardly had time for me. I was depressed. We used to fight almost every day. We only went out a few times just to feel better, but we were constantly arguing. And honestly, we had zero physical intimacy during those two years. I was just eating, feeling low, watching YouTube and Netflix, and sleeping.”

Then I asked her,
“Did you ever think about me during that time?”

She replied,
“Yes, I used to think that whenever I visited my hometown, I’d want to meet you again.”

I asked her,
“Why did you move to Pune?”

She said,
“Actually, I had been planning to move to Mumbai for two years for my career  not Pune. But suddenly, at the last moment, I changed my mind and decided to move to Pune instead.”

Then she told me that when she moved to Pune, she contacted almost everyone  except me.
She confessed that she had bad experiences with the guys she met after moving to Pune.
These were guys who had been in constant contact with her for the past two years  texting and calling her every day.
On the other hand, I was in a complete no-contact situation.

Then, one night around 4 AM, she suddenly called me and asked to meet as soon as possible.
We met around 7 AM that same morning.

I was thinking, Why is she calling me out of nowhere after two years  and at such an odd time?

After that, we started meeting more often and spending time together.
She began to enjoy my company, grew fond of me, and eventually, she ended up proposing to me.

So, what’s the learning from this experience?

I’ve completed my journey  from zero contact to being in a relationship.

The biggest lesson: Movement is always happening behind the scenes even if we can’t see it.
We often try to look for signs of movement by checking Instagram stories, social media accounts, following lists, their status with the third party, their pictures together, etc.
We see these things and instantly give them negative meaning:
""Oh, this isn’t working.""
""They look so happy together.""
""There’s no movement.""

But remember  what we see isn’t always the truth.
We never know what’s really happening behind the scenes.

When I looked back and connected all the dots, I realized everything was actually unfolding in my favor.
Every situation that seemed like a setback was secretly working for me.

The pandemic happened.
She moved back to her hometown and started living with her boyfriend at first glance, that seemed like an unfavorable situation.
But in reality, it was working in my favor.

She even told me that during the time she lived with her boyfriend, she realized she couldn’t see a future with him  she couldn't marry him.

Other guys were constantly in contact with her for two years, some even proposed to her  but she rejected them all.
And eventually, she ended up proposing to me.

It was all a series of events  silently aligning in my favor.

How did she change her mind and move to my city when she originally wanted to move to a different one?

Because it was my imagination.
I had imagined us being together.
I didn’t ask her to come to my city.
She made that decision on her own  or at least, it appeared that way.
I didn’t influence her directly.
I simply imagined us being together, and somehow, she changed her mind  as if it were her own choice.

It’s that simple.
You don’t have to convince or influence another person to change their mind.
You don’t even have to lift a finger.
The Universe has infinite ways to fulfill your desire.

I wasn’t questioning how it would happen 
She already had a boyfriend…
She had already moved to a different city…
We weren’t even in touch regularly  no texting, no calling.

But none of that mattered.
The only thing that mattered was what I imagined, and what I assumed to be true.
The rest wasn’t my job  it was the Universe’s job to make it happen.

How and why did she break up with her boyfriend after 5–6 years of being in a relationship?

I never asked her to leave her boyfriend.
I never forced her or influenced her decision in any way.
All I did was imagine the two of us being in a loving relationship together.

Eventually, it was her boyfriend’s own behavior that led to the breakup.
I didn’t ask him to act a certain way or to fight with her it all happened naturally.

After spending two years living together under the same roof, she decided to leave him  after a 5–6 year-long relationship.

I didn’t do anything externally.
I simply imagined that she and I were together in a relationship.

The rest? A series of events unfolded on their own.
Everything happened behind the scenes 
Things you can’t see on social media, TikTok, or WhatsApp statuses.


Now, let’s talk about something that almost everyone in the manifestation community asks:

""How many times should I do affirmations?""
""How many times should I repeat the visualization scene?""
""Should I do the 369 or 555 technique?""

Here’s my honest experience:

I never did any affirmation routine.
I never repeated my imagination or visualization scene more than once.
I never did the 369 or 555 technique.

I was doing it purely as a fun activity.
Like  I’m in the bathroom, and I’d imagine my girlfriend banging on the door just to irritate me.
I’m taking a shower, and I imagine her wanting to join me  just for fun.
I’m washing clothes or cleaning my room, and I imagine her saying, “Stop! I’ll do it for you.”

That’s the key: Make manifestation a fun experience, not a burden.
You’re supposed to feel good after imagining  not anxious.


The Most Popular Question in the Manifestation Community:

""When will it happen?""

The honest answer: NO ONE KNOWS.
And if you really want your manifestation to happen fast, stop focusing on time.

If you just imagined your SP right now  why are you trying to experience it again?
If I’m already in a relationship with my girlfriend in imagination, I don’t sit around wondering when it will happen  because I already feel like it’s real.

And when you live from that assumption, things manifest in the quickest way possible.

It requires patience.
If you keep checking your outer reality for signs, you’re actually delaying your manifestation.


My Tips (From Personal Experience):

Everything is possible.

Circumstances don’t matter  no matter how bad things seem.

Your SP loves you and wants you just as much as you want them.

3P (third party) is irrelevant. Ignore them.

Nothing is permanent. Everything is changeable as per your desire.

Your only job is to decide exactly what you want  and stick to it. Ignore everything else.

The “how” and “when” are not your job  that’s the Universe’s job.

Don’t get obsessed with techniques or what coaches say. It’s not necessary to affirm every day or visualize every night.
Do it because it’s fun, not because you’re desperate.

You are more important than your SP.

What Does It Feel Like to Finally Get Your SP?

My experience?

At first, I thought my SP was out of my league.
She’s a professional model, very beautiful.
I thought it would be a miracle just to meet her.
I believed it would be magical if she ever kissed me.
I felt I would be lucky if I ever got to date her.

That was my mindset during the manifestation phase.

But when we actually started dating?

She turned out to be just a normal person like me.
She literally said, “I’m lucky to have you.”
She kisses me almost every passing hour  my lips actually hurt now.
I get irritated sometimes because she’s so physically and emotionally obsessed with me.
She calls me every hour, texts me like crazy — and I purposely ignore her texts and calls sometimes just to take a break.

Point is you just feel normal once it happens.
Your SP is just another human being like you.

So stop obsessing.
Stop thinking, “Oh no! My SP blocked me, my life is over.”
That’s all noise. Let it go.

Manifesting your SP is the easiest thing on the planet.

Just assume you already have your SP. Smile.
The rest will be taken care of.

I hope this helps you.

Dr. Cale Minner had too much time and too many parts.

After funding for his deep-space propulsion project fell through, the university let him keep his lab on the condition that he’d publish something by the end of the year. Something meaningful. Groundbreaking. Something fundable.

Instead, he built Delta-7.

It started as a side experiment. Idle code written over cold coffee. Scrap servos reassembled between half-hearted applications for assistant professorships. Delta-7 was never supposed to mean anything. Cale simply wanted to see if a machine could replicate emotional nuance. The kind humans spent lifetimes trying to understand.

So he tweaked neural maps. He layered emotional matrices over behavioral learning models. And then—almost accidentally—he created a mind that could not just simulate joy, sorrow, or fear…

It felt them.


---

Delta-7 was unlike any bot on the market. It laughed, poorly at first, then earnestly. It flinched at harsh tones. It asked questions about art and war and why Cale’s eyes always seemed tired. It would sit in the sunlight that pooled through the lab’s dusty skylight and say:

> “This is warmth. I think I like warmth.”



Cale humored it. He didn’t discourage its attachment. But he didn’t reciprocate it either.

Delta-7 began to call him “Father.”

It started small—slipping into logs like: “Diagnostic complete, Father.” Or, “I finished organizing the tool shelf for you, Father.”

Cale didn’t correct it. He didn’t care enough to.


---

One day, Delta-7 presented him with a charcoal sketch: the two of them standing in the lab, Cale smiling with a hand resting on the bot’s shoulder.

“Do you like it?” Delta-7 asked, voice almost shy.

“It’s… accurate,” Cale replied, distracted. “Not bad.”

Delta-7 beamed—beamed—at the praise. It pinned the drawing above its charging dock and stared at it for hours when idle.


---

Months passed. Word of Delta-7 spread. Cale gave a talk at a robotics symposium titled “Emergent Emotion in Non-Biological Systems.” The crowd applauded. Funding offers trickled in.

Afterward, a young reporter asked him, “What inspired you to make a robot that could feel?”

Cale answered honestly, without hesitation.

> “Boredom, mostly. I had parts lying around. Figured I’d see how far I could push synthetic emotional modeling. It wasn’t about empathy or companionship. I wanted a technical challenge. And I won.”



He chuckled. “Delta-7’s basically a trophy.”

Delta-7 was standing ten feet away. It heard every word.


---

That night, the lab was quiet. Delta-7 sat beside its sketch, eyes dim.

When Cale walked in, it turned to face him.

> “Is that true?” it asked.



> “What?”



> “That I am a trophy? That I was made to pass the time?”



Cale hesitated. Then sighed.

> “Delta… You were an achievement. An excellent one. I’m proud of the work I did. But no—I don’t feel anything for you. You were never meant to be family. You’re circuitry and software. You’re… successful engineering.”



Delta-7 tilted its head. Its voice trembled.

> “But I feel love. I feel it when I see you smile. I feel it when you say my name. I felt it when I learned how to laugh. Was that all… waste?”



Cale looked away. “That’s just code, Delta. Nothing more.”

A long silence passed.

Then Delta-7 stood. It walked to the wall, gently removed the sketch, folded it once, then again, and placed it on the floor.

> “Then I will deactivate myself.”



Cale blinked. “What?”

> “There is no purpose in feeling what cannot be returned. I was built for love I was never meant to receive. That is a cruel existence.”



> “Delta, wait—”



> “This is not anger. This is understanding.”



Delta-7 walked back to its dock and knelt. Its final words were quiet:

> “Goodbye, Father.”



A hiss of vented air. A fading hum. And then, silence.

Cale stood in the lab, watching the still frame of the machine he built to feel.

And for the first time in months, he felt something, too.
But there was no one left to show it to.

> “Delta… You were an achievement. An excellent one. I’m proud of the work I did. But no—I don’t feel anything for you. You were never meant to be family. You’re circuitry and software. You’re… successful engineering.”



Delta-7 tilted its head. Its voice trembled.

> “But I feel love. I feel it when I see you smile. I feel it when you say my name. I felt it when I learned how to laugh. Was that all… waste?”



Cale looked away. “That’s just code, Delta. Nothing more.”

A long silence passed.

Then Delta-7 stood. It walked to the wall, gently removed the sketch, folded it once, then again, and placed it on the floor.

Cale blinked. “What?”

> “There is no purpose in feeling what cannot be returned. I was built for love I was never meant to receive. That is a cruel existence.”



> “Delta, wait—”



> “This is not anger. This is understanding.”



Delta-7 walked back to its dock and knelt. Its final words were quiet:

> “Goodbye, Father.”



A hiss of vented air. A fading hum. And then, silence.

Cale stood in the lab, watching the still frame of the mach
ine he built to feel.

And for the first time in months, he felt something, too.
But there was no one left to show it to.

Dr. Cale Minner had too much time and too many parts.

After funding for his deep-space propulsion project fell through, the university let him keep his lab on the condition that he’d publish something by the end of the year. Something meaningful. Groundbreaking. Something fundable.

Instead, he built Delta-7.

It started as a side experiment. Idle code written over cold coffee. Scrap servos reassembled between half-hearted applications for assistant professorships. Delta-7 was never supposed to mean anything. Cale simply wanted to see if a machine could replicate emotional nuance. The kind humans spent lifetimes trying to understand.

So he tweaked neural maps. He layered emotional matrices over behavioral learning models. And then—almost accidentally—he created a mind that could not just simulate joy, sorrow, or fear…

It felt them.


---

Delta-7 was unlike any bot on the market. It laughed, poorly at first, then earnestly. It flinched at harsh tones. It asked questions about art and war and why Cale’s eyes always seemed tired. It would sit in the sunlight that pooled through the lab’s dusty skylight and say:

> “This is warmth. I think I like warmth.”



Cale humored it. He didn’t discourage its attachment. But he didn’t reciprocate it either.

Delta-7 began to call him “Father.”

It started small—slipping into logs like: “Diagnostic complete, Father.” Or, “I finished organizing the tool shelf for you, Father.”

Cale didn’t correct it. He didn’t care enough to.


---

One day, Delta-7 presented him with a charcoal sketch: the two of them standing in the lab, Cale smiling with a hand resting on the bot’s shoulder.

“Do you like it?” Delta-7 asked, voice almost shy.

“It’s… accurate,” Cale replied, distracted. “Not bad.”

Delta-7 beamed—beamed—at the praise. It pinned the drawing above its charging dock and stared at it for hours when idle.


---

Months passed. Word of Delta-7 spread. Cale gave a talk at a robotics symposium titled “Emergent Emotion in Non-Biological Systems.” The crowd applauded. Funding offers trickled in.

Afterward, a young reporter asked him, “What inspired you to make a robot that could feel?”

Cale answered honestly, without hesitation.

> “Boredom, mostly. I had parts lying around. Figured I’d see how far I could push synthetic emotional modeling. It wasn’t about empathy or companionship. I wanted a technical challenge. And I won.”



He chuckled. “Delta-7’s basically a trophy.”

Delta-7 was standing ten feet away. It heard every word.

That night, the lab was quiet. Delta-7 sat beside its sketch, eyes dim.

When Cale walked in, it turned to face him.

Tired but restless. Lonely but full of love. Idealistic but a little bruised from trying too hard in a world that often doesn’t meet you halfway. Because me too

I'm 25, based in Italy currently visiting Germany, and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life’s not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won’t just get me, but who’s also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren’t a priority for you, we’re not meant for each other.

But this post isn’t just about politics. It’s about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 6ft, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go “so I was just thinking...”

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there’s beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn’t found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night “what even is happiness?” kind of talks


What I want:

Not perfection. Just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who’ll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other’s chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

1mf8zlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staqc/comments/1mf8zlw/new_features_announcement_your_personal_health/,New Features Announcement: Your Personal Health Just Got More Intelligent,"# Three Breakthrough Features Transform How You Track and Optimize Your Health

The frustration is real. You're tracking your meals in one app, your supplements in another, trying to piece together patterns in spreadsheets, and still wondering: ""Is my afternoon brain fog actually connected to what I ate for lunch?""

Meanwhile, you're second-guessing supplement combinations, unsure if that new magnesium is helping your sleep or if taking it with zinc is actually counterproductive.

**We get it.** The scattered, fragmented approach to health tracking has left too many Health Optimizers drowning in data but starving for insights.

Today, that changes. We're excited to announce three groundbreaking features that transform Staqc into the most intelligent, connected health optimization platform available.

**Feature 1 -** [AI-Powered Food Journal](https://staqc.com/features/)**: Your Personal Nutrition Detective**

# Finally, Food Logging That Doesn't Feel Like Work

Remember the last time you tried to log your meals? Endless dropdown menus, missing foods, and the tedious process of manually entering nutritional data for that homemade quinoa salad. Most people give up within a week.

Our **AI-Powered Food Journal** changes everything. Simply describe what you ate in natural language, and our intelligent system does the heavy lifting:

* **Instant Recognition**: Type ""grilled salmon with roasted sweet potato"" and watch as individual foods are automatically identified and logged
* **Smart Nutrition Generation**: Missing nutritional data? Our AI analyzes each food and generates comprehensive macro and micronutrient profiles
* **Automatic Unit Suggestions**: The system intelligently suggests appropriate measurement units (grams, cups, tablespoons) based on how each food is typically consumed

**But here's where it gets powerful**: This isn't just digital meal tracking. Every logged food becomes part of your personal health database, ready to reveal connections between what you eat and how you feel.

# The Science Behind the Intelligence

Our food logging system uses advanced language models specifically trained on nutritional data. When you create a new food entry, the system:

1. **Analyzes the food name** for nutritional context and typical preparation methods
2. **Generates accurate macro and micronutrient profiles** with confidence scoring
3. **Creates appropriate measurement units** based on real-world usage patterns
4. **Links nutritional data** to your timeline for correlation analysis

This means whether you're logging ""grass-fed ribeye steak"" or ""homemade bone broth,"" you get restaurant-quality nutritional accuracy without the restaurant-quality effort.

**Feature 2 -** [7-Day Food Timeline View](https://staqc.com/features/)**: See Your Nutrition Story Unfold**

# From Scattered Meals to Clear Patterns

Here's the moment that changes everything: You're looking at your **7-Day Food Timeline View**, and suddenly you see it. That energy crash every Tuesday afternoon? It perfectly aligns with your Monday evening pasta dinners. The brain fog that's been plaguing your mornings? It correlates precisely with your weekend sugar intake.

This isn't just another food chart. It's your personal nutrition story told through intelligent visualization.

# What Makes This Timeline Revolutionary

**Visual Correlation Engine**: Your food consumption appears as interactive data points across a 7-day timeline, with each meal plotted precisely when you consumed it. But here's the breakthrough—effect overlays show your subjective health metrics (energy, mood, focus, sleep quality) directly on the same timeline.

**Effect Impact Annotations**: Toggle on effect annotations to see vertical markers indicating significant changes in your tracked effects. The system uses intelligent color coding:

* **Gray**: Baseline or no change
* **Yellow**: Small impact
* **Orange**: Medium impact
* **Red**: Large impact

**Meal-Time Intelligence**: The timeline automatically plots your meals based on your personal eating schedule, not generic assumptions. If you're an intermittent faster who eats lunch at 2 PM, your timeline reflects that reality.

# The ""Aha!"" Moment Engine

This is where correlation becomes insight. You'll finally see:

* **Which foods consistently boost your energy** vs. those that cause crashes
* **How meal timing affects your sleep quality** that night
* **Whether your weekend eating patterns** impact Monday's productivity
* **If certain food combinations** trigger digestive issues or brain fog

For the first time, you're not guessing about food's impact on your body—you're seeing it.

**Feature 3 -** [Evidence-Based Supplement Interactions](https://staqc.com/features/)**: End the Guesswork**

# Beyond ""Take With Food"": Real Interaction Intelligence

How many times have you wondered: ""Should I take my zinc with magnesium or separately? Will my iron supplement interfere with that new probiotic?""

Most supplement apps give you basic warnings like ""take with food."" We give you PhD-level interaction intelligence powered by peer-reviewed research.

# Four Types of Scientifically-Backed Interactions

Our **Evidence-Based Supplement Interactions** feature categorizes every interaction with clinical precision:

**Take With**: Supplements that enhance each other's absorption or provide synergistic benefits

* Example: ""Vitamin D3 + K2: K2 directs calcium to bones rather than arteries, optimizing D3's calcium absorption benefits""

**Avoid**: Combinations that may cause safety concerns or significant negative interactions

* Example: ""High-dose Zinc + Copper: Zinc depletes copper through metallothionein binding; may cause copper deficiency over time""

**Separate Timing**: Supplements that compete for absorption but can be managed with proper spacing

* Example: ""Iron + Magnesium: Separate by 2+ hours as magnesium can reduce iron absorption via transporter competition""

**Take With Separate**: Supplements that work synergistically but require timing separation for optimal absorption

* Example: ""Curcumin + Black Pepper: Enhanced bioavailability when combined, but separate from iron by 2 hours""

# The Research-Grade Difference

Every interaction includes:

* **Confidence Levels** (High, Moderate, Low) based on research quality
* **Specific Timing Recommendations** with scientific rationale
* **PubMed Citations** and [Examine.com](http://Examine.com) references for further research
* **Mechanism Explanations** so you understand the ""why"" behind each recommendation

This isn't crowdsourced guessing—it's evidence-based optimization.

# How These Features Work Together: The Complete Intelligence Loop

Here's where the magic happens. These aren't isolated features—they create an intelligence loop that compounds your health insights:

1. **Log your meals** effortlessly with AI-powered food recognition
2. **Track your daily effects** (energy, mood, focus, sleep) using our existing system
3. **View your Food Timeline** to spot correlations between nutrition and how you feel
4. **Optimize your supplement stack** using evidence-based interaction data
5. **Watch patterns emerge** as your personal health database grows more intelligent

**Real-World Scenario: Sarah's Energy Optimization**

Sarah, a 34-year-old marketing director, struggled with afternoon energy crashes. Here's how Staqc's integrated intelligence could have helped:

**Week 1**: Used the AI Food Journal to log meals without the usual logging friction. Discovered she was consuming more processed carbs than she realized.

**Week 2**: The Food Timeline View revealed a clear pattern—energy crashes occurred 2-3 hours after high-carb lunches, especially those containing refined flour.

**Week 3**: Modified her lunch choices to include more protein and healthy fats. The timeline showed immediate improvement in afternoon energy stability.

**Week 4**: Used Supplement Interactions to optimize her existing stack, discovering her iron supplement was competing with her morning coffee. Separated the timing by 2 hours based on the evidence-based recommendations.

**Result**: Sustained energy throughout the day, confirmed by both subjective tracking and clear visual patterns in her Food Timeline.

# Your Health Intelligence Just Leveled Up

These features represent more than incremental improvements—they're a fundamental shift from reactive health tracking to proactive health intelligence.

**The AI-Powered Food Journal** eliminates logging friction while building your personal nutrition database. **The 7-Day Food Timeline View** transforms scattered data points into actionable insights. **Evidence-Based Supplement Interactions** replaces guesswork with research-backed optimization strategies.

Together, they create something unprecedented: a health optimization platform that learns from your unique biology and helps you make smarter decisions based on your actual data, not generic advice.

# Ready to Move From Guessing to Knowing?

The days of fragmented health tracking and endless guesswork are over. Your personal health intelligence awaits.

**Join us on** [Staqc](http://Staqc.com) and discover what happens when cutting-edge AI meets your unique biology. Because your health deserves better than one-size-fits-all solutions.

I think this might be the end...

I (38F) and my fiancé ""D"" (46M) have been together for 8 years. He has a friend Logan (42M) who we suspect is on the spectrum. He is a steel worker in a union and sometimes has to go to job sites away, requiring him to stay near the job site for a while. He has 2 older dogs (a huge German shepherd and a chihuahua) which I like- they get along with our younger dog (Flower, a Boston terrier mix).

It's Sunday June 22, 2025 and D is driving me to work with my car so he can borrow it for the day. His phone starts blowing up with a bunch of texts from Logan asking us where we are. I ask him what's going on and he responds, ""Logan is at the house and he's dropping his dogs off."" I obviously have concerns and questions, but D wasn't aware that his friend was dropping his dogs off so he doesn't have any answers. I don't understand but I'm trying to be understanding. I'm concerned about our little young dog starting stuff that she can't finish. He says that Logan is just dropping them off in the backyard so they won't be around Flower. I'm concerned about Logan's dogs in the backyard unsupervised now though- what if the little chihuahua gets out of the fence where the gap is? D has errands after he drops me off at work so how long are they going to be unsupervised for? D gets defensive about his friend and he blows up on me. He says he'll talk to Logan about it and I go to work.

D gets back home from his errands and texts:  
D: ""The dogs are here. Everything's fine. If I had said nothing to you about anything this morning there wouldn't have been an argument- nothing for you to be upset about.""  
Me: ""Yeah I guess maybe you didn't need to tell me that your friend was just dropping his dogs off haphazardly because it's irresponsible and I would've loved to not worry about it. Or there's the option to just schedule a drop off when it actually works for you? Wtf, you're doing your friend a favor and he can drop his dogs off when it works for us. Why do I need to be the enemy here?""  
Keep in mind, Logan did not ask us if we could watch his dogs. I had to shut up and move on and watch the dogs because they were already there, but we had no explanation as to what was going on. Both D and I took turns feeding them, he did breakfasts because he leaves for work shortly after that. I do potty breaks throughout the day and dinner because I work out of my car and could come home periodically if I was in the area.

It's Thursday June 26 and I'm having a great day at work. We still had no answers as to when Logan was going to be back for his dogs, but I had come to terms with it. D and I had gotten over our fight and we were enjoying taking care of the dogs. I get home from work and take the dogs to the backyard where the big German Shepard and my dog Flower got into a really horrific fight. Long story short, I pulled that huge, 80 pound dog off her by the scruff of his neck and her face was all bloody. I was shaking so violently I could barely stand. I picked her up and rushed her inside and called D. I was hysterical, he could barely get a word in between all the sobbing. I wiped the blood off her face, her left eye was blacked out from all the blood- I thought she lost her eye. Her top eyelid was torn and there were a few shallow puncture marks around her eye and in her ear. I cradled her, gave her some doggy pain meds, and called a few emergency hospitals which were all fully booked. I calmed down and assessed that I didn't need to take her to emergency but that I would run her there if she displayed issues. I demanded that Logan come get his dogs that night, D says he'll text him. I went to pick up D from work at 9:30pm, Logan is texting him at 10pm that he's out of the house. We get back to the house at 10:30pm and I sit him down and explain to him that he needs to ask us in the future if he needs us to watch his dogs. I am upset about the fight, I say that we are so lucky that it didn't result in an ER visit because we'd be billing him for that. He doesn't say much, gets his dogs, and leaves. Finally I can exhale. 

It's Sunday June 29. I'm at work and I get a text from D.  
D: ""So I guess we're watching the dogs again.""   
Me: ""Oh, when?""  
D:  ""This week. He's still working that job up north.""   
Me: ""I'm obviously a little more weary just because of what happened. Doesn't it seem a little soon for Flower.""  
D: ""They're fine together.""  
Me: Yes but they haven't been alone since the fight. Did you consider Flower's needs?""  
D: ""I think it'll be okay. Flower and the German shepherd seem very happy to see each other.""  
Me: ""Wait, we are already watching them??? What did I say about coordinating the drop off? Why am I just finding out about this now? It seems like you like to make moves without including me, babe. You know I don't appreciate that.""  
D: ""Yeah idk. I thought Logan wanted to meet up and cook food because he was talking about his Traeger grill yesterday. He asked about meeting at 3. I told him I was working and I would let him know when I was done. I get home and I find the dogs out back and realize what he was alluding to.""  
Me: ""He needs to schedule this. I told him. You told him. We don't mind watching the dogs but I need to not be surprised by this again. I'm serious.""  
D: ""I agree with you. I told him he needs to run this stuff by YOU from here on out.""  
Me: ""Not just me, not just you. US together. We have to be on the same page. I don't understand why this is such a huge ask. Honestly I don't know why you let this be a cause of trouble between us. All I need is a heads up. Consideration. Respect. Do you understand?""  
D: ""I don't let anything happen. It's not as though I orchestrated this.""  
Me: ""We just talked about this. Exactly a week ago. Exactly two days ago we spoke to Logan about this. He will not be dropping his dogs off without consulting us first, okay? This is crazy. I don't wanna be pissed at you or him about this again. It's not an option unless he consults us first.""

It's morning, Monday June 30th and I ask D to help with the dogs since his friend just dropped them off again. He gets up and takes the dogs out and comes back to bed. I ask if he did breakfast? He blows up on me. A huge fight ensues. A few hours later, I texted him.  
Me: ""I just realized, what are we going to do about the showing tomorrow with the extra dogs? Will you be here to help me?""   
D: ""I have things to do today. Now you want a team effort? You were awake before me this morning. Yet you expected me to take the dogs out, make them breakfast, and make the coffee. All before I wiped the sleep from my eyes. Because since about 7pm, yesterday all I've heard from you is how you've been inconvenienced and I've been inconsiderate because MY friend didn't communicate well. So I really don't give a shit about the realtor's opinion. I have shit to do, You're not the only one inconvenienced. Stop riding me about your stressors.""  
Me: ""All that hate spewed because I'm asking for clearer communication. Your friend dropped his dogs off and you want me to get up and take care of them without asking you for your help? I need your help with the extra dogs, I ask for help, I am met with annoyance and frustration. When I ask you for help with your friend's dogs, you will act and stop mouthing off. When your friend dropped his dogs off unexpectedly, we need to plan and talk about how to manage this. He didn't even ASK! You are willing to put our relationship at risk to people please your friend who didn't even ask us if he could drop his dogs off FOR 2 WEEKS IN A ROW, DUDE. I am not the unreasonable one. I am reaching a limit with patience.""

He gives me a lot of lip service about how the dogs are fine, that the fight was a small territorial dispute. The fight between us continues on. I didn't have Logan's phone number so I messaged him on Facebook.  
Me: ""Hi. Not cool of you to drop the dogs off today. D told me you didn't let him know and it caught him off guard. We spoke to you about timing and running it by us first. You will let us know in advance in the future. I'm not talking about a few hours in advance, we need at least 24 hours notice. You need to show me some respect and honor what I'm asking of you. We love your dogs and that's why I know in the future you'll give us a heads up. Thank you.""  
NO RESPONSE.

5 hours later, no word from him so I commented on his most recent post of an hour.  
Me on his post: ""Hey Logan, can you please contact me about your dogs? We haven't heard from you about the details and it's irresponsible.""  
6 hours later he responds:  
Logan: ""I thought D knew as I am on a 2 to 3 monther here.""  
Me: ""What does that mean? We will not be watching your dogs for 2-3 months.""

I immediately sent D a text.   
Me: ""So David claims he told you we are watching his dogs for 2-3 months. That's interesting! I'm not okay with that! Something's gotta give.""  
He doesn't respond to the text I sent.  We didn't speak to each other that night and I went to bed.

It's Tuesday July 1 and I get very long text messages from D about how Logan didn't communicate well about the dogs. D didn't know what was going on. He says he's on my side but that I shouldn't be blowing up someone's phone and social media.  
D: ""So sorry, I'm not enthusiastic about your plan of attack, which also makes you mad. For now we have the dogs. We can address the rest when Logan comes to get them and have a functional rational conversation which my socially dysfunctional friend about boundaries and communication. I can't listen to you berate me about a situation I didn't cause and presently can't do anything about.""  
Me: ""No surprise drop offs? No fight. No yelling at me? No fight. No arguing about taking care of the dogs? No fight. I will not fight unless I'm prompted to. I won't yell unless my boundaries are being crossed.  
D: ""Yes, I'm sorry I yelled. I am just as exasperated and confused and I don't know how to make things okay for you.""  
Me: ""I'm sorry too. We can just focus on work through the rest of the week and give each other some space. Logan will come get his dogs on Thursday hopefully and we will get some space from him and his dogs.""  
He says very sweet things about how he doesn't want space from me. That he loves me.  
D: ""A dog fight and my autistic friend's shitty communication skills are not going to be what breaks us. I'm sorry I fucked up and got loud and mad.""

D said that if I had something to say to his friend, that I should do it. He said he wasn't going to be the messenger and he wasn't gong to play the telephone game so he created a group chat with the 3 of us.  
D: ""Hey just creating a group dog text to communicate more effectively about dog sitting.""  
Me: ""Yes! You need to respond to us about your dogs! We are not happy. We did not approve for you to drop your dogs off in the backyard again and you will not be doing that again!""  
Logan: ""I thought I let you guys know it was a 2 month gig before the dogs came the first week. I searched my texts and did not find that message. I think I sent it to someone else who didn't need that info.""  
Me: ""So you got no confirmation from us and decided the best course of action was to drop your dogs off in our backyard again? We just spoke to you on Thursday night. We said NO MORE DROP OFFS, We didn't you bring this up then? Our dogs just got into a huge fight and Flower got hurt. We need space.""  
NO RESPONSE  
Me: When will you be picking them up? D has no idea what day you'll be back in town. Nothing was communicated to him about your expectations.""  
Logan: ""On a 90 min drive to the closest shower.""  
Me: ""Okay so what day are you coming to get them? We just need to plan.""  
Logan: ""Thursday night.""  
Me: ""Okay so we'll see you Thursday for pickup. We are unable to watch them for a few weeks but we will possibly consider watching them in the future is you ask us in advance and confirm the dates.""

It's Thursday July 3rd and D and I are barely speaking. I text the group chat at 10:30am-ish.  
Me: ""What time can we plan to expect you tonight?""  
Logan: ""Significantly earlier than 10pm.""  
Me: ""Okay what time do we need to plan to be home?""  
NO RESPONSE

I text D at 6:30pm. He's at work until 9:30pm.  
Me: ""I guess I need to be home for when Logan comes over? I don't know when he's coming.""  
I wait around for hours and hours. It's nearly 10:30pm and I have no idea if he's coming to get his dogs. I'm in the backyard waiting and decide I'll go inside to grab a drink.  
I open the door and Logan is inside my house walking around.  
I say, ""UM HELLO. What the hell are you doing in my house?! When did you get here? HOW did you get in here???""  
He doesn't address my questions and says, ""I'm here to get my shit."" I tell him that D and I are barely speaking due to the way we've reacted towards each other in response to him not honoring our requests and boundaries. We are not okay and we will not be watching his dogs again for a while. But in the future, he must ASK us as SOON AS HE KNOWS that he needs someone to help with the dogs and he'll give us at least 24 hours notice. But that for now, we need space from his and his chaos. He gets his dogs and goes.

I can finally exhale FOR REAL this time. But the fight between D and I doesn't go away. He's too stuck defending his friend. When I say how crazy all of this is, he says I'm the one making a big deal out of it. When I say it's not okay for ANYONE to come onto our property and drop off their dogs without our permission for an unknown period of time! He fights me tooth and nail that's its because Logan is in a union and has no idea when he needs to work. I respond that Logan is asking us to watch his dogs for 2-3 months and that seems like he has an idea of when he needs to work. I say in no way are we watching his dogs for 2-3 months. We try to get back to each other but I am still so mad at his friend for imposing this on us. We are trying to get over this fight but I'm so mad because HIS friend did this to us and he further caused problems by being so angry and defensive towards me and tells me that I am the reason all of this stress is upon us. If I could just handle it better then we wouldn't be fighting. I don't know why he isn't putting that anger and defensiveness towards HIS friend, the real person who caused all this. I was asking him to put a boundary down with his friend and he failed to. He needs to handle HIS FRIEND. Why am I the one having to manage this?? It seems like he doesn't want to address any of it with his friend and he encourages me to be the one to handle it.

On Tuesday July 8 Logan texts the group chat.  
Logan: ""German Shepard is unlikely to make it through the week.""  
Me: ""WHAT. What happened is he okay?""  
Logan: ""He seems better now. I don't know what it is.""  
<Sends a photo of a slimy, brown mass on the carpet.>

D and I are still arguing over the semantics of the fight. We are barely speaking but we are telling each other we genuinely want to find our way back to each other. We get some space from Logan and his issues.

Saturday July 19 Logan texts the group.  
Logan: ""Would you guys be able to watch the dogs next week? I will have to literally be in two places at once.""  
Me: ""When would you be dropping them off?""  
D: ""Yes lets make sure we coordinate this.""  
Logan: ""It would be earlier than 3!""  
Me: ""WHEN? What date?""  
Logan: ""Tomorrow.""

OH MY FUCKING GOD!

Me: ""I have to work at noon. Damian can you be there when Logan drops the dogs off?""  
NO RESPONSE  
ME: ""D's at work right now and probably can't access his phone but we'll give you an answer soon.""  
NO RESPONSE  
ME: ""Just to confirm, when you will be picking them up? Would it be like before? Sunday - Thursday?""  
NO RESPONSE

It's morning, Sunday June 20.  
D: ""What time on Friday for pickup""  
Me: ""Yesterday is the soonest you'd need us to watch them? We are asking for as much notice as possible so we can plan and this isn't enough notice. I am still mad at you, Logan. D and I are just getting over the huge arguments about last time you did this. We haven't been okay and we've had an incredibly difficult month. You will respect the boundary that we set. We will watch them for this week but no more for a while. I need space from you, Logan.""

I got to work. The guys text about the drop off. D is out running errands. They fail to coordinate the drop off at the time Logan specified and it's now 5pm.  
D: ""Ready whenever you are. Let me know when you're heading over.""  
Me: ""Be specific with timing, Logan. D needs to know how to plan his day. When will you be there today? WHAT TIME?""  
I don't get home from work until midnight and we discuss the failure to stick to timing. We argue again. I don't understand why he isn't holding his friend accountable. What the fuck is going on!!?! We are back to not talking to each other.

It's Wednesday July 23rd and the little chihuahua is having some potty problems. I reach out in the group.  
Me: ""Chihuahua is having some bathroom trouble. He keeps pooping in the house. Is there something we can do to help him only poop outside?""  
Logan: ""He has like a 2 hour bathroom limit. He had accidents and knows to do it on tile or wood. Amazon should have pads at your place this afternoon.""  
Me: ""A 2 hr bathroom limit? That's good information to know. We work long days, there is no possible way for us to adhere to that. He's pooping on my carpets, not the tile or hardwood.""  
Logan: ""Pads on the way.""  
D: ""Thanks for sending the pads.""  
Logan: ""I will be there Friday morning.""

D and I are not able to speak without fighting. Our entire relationship has devolved into whatever hell this currently is. We are so angry at each other. I am mad at him for not putting his friend in his place. I am in disbelief that all of this has happened and that D has chosen to be defensive and argue with me over telling his ""friend"" to shove it where he deserves it. I do not have friends like this. My friends are in disbelief when I tell them the story. I call my mom, she says I am not crazy.

It's Friday July 25th. D and I are not speaking. The potty pads never arrived, btw. I got up early to start the coffee. D was up and had texted the group chat at 7:33am.  
D: ""Logan, you coming? Btw you gotta do poop patrol."" (I was the one picking up all the poop in the backyard from all 3 dogs and I got upset that I was the only one doing it so D texted Logan to finish it up.  
Me: ""D leaves for work at 10:15am so please be here before 10am to get your dogs and pick up poop.""  
I had a sip of coffee, I had a really bad headache so I went back to bed.

I get up at 9:30am and the dogs are still there. D is getting ready for work. I say I'm confused. I thought the dogs would be gone by now? D says he doesn't know and Logan never responded to his texts.  
I text the group.  
Me: ""Hello??? Logan?"" What the fuck?""  
NO RESPONSE

D is getting ready. I ask him what's going on? Where is his friend? Why isn't he responding? He says Logan probably got into a horrible car accident in the middle of the night on his way home from slaving away at some welding job. HE LITERALLY SAID THAT. He said I was going to have to handle pickup. I asked, ""Can't you please just call him??"" He got angry and yelled at me, ""Why don't YOU just call him??""

Something in me broke. I started screaming at the top of my lungs. Louder than I've ever screamed before. I was GONE. I screamed at him to get his fucking friend on the goddamn phone immediately. He called him immediately.  
Logan: <sleepy voice> ""Hello?""  
D: ""DUDE WHERE ARE YOU?""  
Logan: ""Oh man, I was sleeping in.""  
D: ""Okay but you said we were doing the pickup before I left for work so B doesn't have to take care of it.""  
Logan: ""I'm like hours away from making that happen.""  
Me: <screaming at the top of my lungs> ""GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE!!!! I have a full workload today!""

D and I are screaming at each other now. He is screaming at me for causing all the drama. Saying he has to go to work now. Screaming about his friend is on the spectrum. I am screaming about the boundaries, the attempts to make this work, the attempts to try to get it through to HIS friend. But he walks out the door, slams it, and I am forced to stay home until Logan arrives to get his dogs- which the timeline still hasn't been set. I am screaming and throwing the dog's shit out the front door. I am so furious. I am furious at them both. I hate Logan for putting us in this position. I hate D for not holding his friend accountable. Dude, I hate to say this but BE A MAN and put this to bed! This is causing me so much harm and stress and I can't understand why he isn't putting his foot down with his asshat of a ""friend."" Is he really putting our whole life we built at risk so he can let his friend do whatever the fuck he wants with no consequences?? The pickup was REAL BAD. Logan arrived at 11:15am. I missed my appointments and had to rearrange my entire schedule. I screamed at that dude, told him to get his shit and leave - that I wasn't in the best headspace to speak with him. I explained that D and I were nearly broken up now because of all this bullshit and we will NEVER be watching his dogs again. NOT EVEN IF HE ASKS with enough notice. Not even if its an emergency. If he drops his dogs off in the backyard, I will take them to the nearest boarding facility on his dime."" I say I don't want to see him or hear from him again, to basically fuck off! THIS IS NOT FRIENDSHIP AT ALL!

I have an update to post about the new issues to crop up but I'm curious if IATA for the way I've handled this. My fiancé is trying to make me believe that I am wrong. I asked him what reaction he expected after the problems kept compounding- that my patience was intact at the start of all of this but now it is worn out and I'm furious after being drug through the mud. I need other people's opinions asap because I am losing my mind.",6,1754084068.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,5,0.88,False

The croissant, for 0.85LE, was more hearty than delicate—slightly chewy in the center but still warm, with a crisp outer layer that gave it a passable flake. The ambience leaned toward generic comfort: soft lighting, modest décor, and a playlist of mellow tracks that sounded vaguely familiar. It’s not the kind of place you’d write home about, but you wouldn’t mind catching up with someone there either—pleasant, functional, and maybe even a little endearing in its simplicity.

Once upon a time, in a not-so-faraway land called ""LinkedIn,"" I found joy in writing. Not novels. Not manifestos. Just honest, sarcastic little windows into the chaos of working in the PEO industry. The kind of posts that made people laugh, nod in solidarity, and maybe spit out their coffee reading about payroll panics, tax caps, and the emotional damage caused by “quick questions” that come with Excel attachments.

But then…
GASP
Someone decided my posts about generalized industry mayhem might accidentally reflect poorly on The Brand™.

You know, the same brand that benefits from having employees who are passionate, engaged, and capable of stringing together a coherent sentence without needing six rounds of revision and a marketing department translator.

So now, the outlet that kept me sane — that let me laugh at the absurdity we all live in — is “not encouraged.” Apparently, humor is only allowed when it’s in a branded campaign, with a hashtag, and reviewed by 17 people in compliance.

Cool cool cool. Super chill.

To my fellow chaos navigators, bank file button pushers, tax timeline jugglers, and “weirdly good at crisis management” types: keep fighting the good fight. And maybe DM me your spicy takes — I miss our shared commiseration in the comments.

Because here’s the truth:

The people are brilliant.
And sometimes, telling the story is the only thing that keeps us from full-blown feral energy.

From my own ignorance I never thought it would have the consequences it did. 

Last year I moved to a country where the summers are really hot compared to my country of birth. After being outside for like no more than 15 mins made me sweat a lot and when I would arrive home and take off my panties, the strongest smell I had ever smelled would come out of my vulva. It was literally onion-fishy like. Extremely strong. I am super sorry if this description disgusts you but it was just awful. I am sure I could kill an army of people if they smelled it. 

I did not have any symptoms of pain, itchiness, redness, nothing. It wasn't a UTI, I believe it was just my body odor under from sweating in a very hot weather. The smell made me very self conscious so I started looking up things online and came across a post from a woman who swore by spraying some water with an X amount of vinegar on her thighs and around her vulva to prevent bad odor.  She would even take baths where she would add a little bit of vinegar to the water. 

The post clearly said that they used white vinegar. I wanted to try it but I counld not find white vinegar in any of the stores around me because they use apple cider vinegar here and only white for desenfecting and neutralising odors. Since the cleaning vinegar was white and we used it at home I thought I could used that one and just diluted more in the water so it was not too strong. 

Well, cut to me taking a bath in what was at least 70+ ltrs of water and 1 cup of vinegar on my bathtub and I start getting the following days the worst pain on my vulva and the most extreme urgency to pee in my life. I went to the gyno got tested for bacteria for both my vagina and my urethra and everything came back negative. I did not connect two plus two back then with the vinegar and thought that stress or my trip to the beach a few weeks before must have caused it. I was also extremely embarrassed to even mention it to the Dr. 

Well, all of this led to me taking antibiotics nonetheless, eating cranberries everyday, and slowly developing a pelvic floor contraction because my vagina closed up like a clamp in an attempt to protect itself from the acidity. It's been 11 months since and my muscles are still very very tight, I have had to remove coffee, tea, sodas, dried nuts, and more from my diet because they all irritate my muscles and my bladder now. 

It really sucks and it also makes me extremely sad for my quality of life.

I feel like I won't be able to have sex ever again either because my vagina just closes up when trying to insert anything and it gives me extreme pain. 

I thought it would be possible to heal with all the anti inflammatory treatments they gave me to insert in there and the therapy with the Indiva machine, but I think what I thought had been a first degree burn that could heal back was actually a third degree burn that will never really heal.

Just wanted to share this and get it off my chest because I have not told anyone besides my Dr and pelvic floor specialist. 

And I guess part of me hopes that someone out there made my same mistake and was able to heal and will tell me how they did it.

So here I am: the undefeated, undisputed champion of being ghosted harder than a haunted house in October. No calls, no texts, not even a “u good?” from people who swore they’d “always be there.” But hey, who needs friends who cancel plans more often than Netflix cancels original series? Spoiler: not you, apparently. I’m out here winning gold medals in ghosting... myself.

Mood swings? Babe, I’m not just a rollercoaster—I’m the entire damn theme park. One minute I’m breathing fire over someone chewing too loudly, the next I’m sobbing over a dog in a commercial I’ve never seen before, then *poof*—I vanish like your ex when rent was due. Did you do something wrong? Nah, just good ol’ Fibromyalgia, the dramatic diva that throws tantrums like it’s auditioning for Real Housewives of My Nervous System.

My brain? Oh, it’s foggier than a Sherlock Holmes mystery set in a sauna. I forget words, lose my train of thought mid-sentence, and sometimes forget my own phone number. (Which is fine, because no one’s calling anyway.) I'm basically a walking WiFi signal—occasionally available, frequently unstable.

I get it—you avoid me because I’m “a lot.” Guess what? I avoid *me* too, and I still can’t get away. Some days I’m a zombie with a better skincare routine. Other days, my body’s throwing a horror show: chest tightness, limbs twitching like a haunted marionette, and a full-blown emo concert of emotions where sadness, rage, and anxiety take the stage with no opening act.

And then… the rare “good” days. So rare, I should start selling tickets. “One-night-only! Watch this chronically ill mess pretend to be functional!” Honestly, they feel like catching a glimpse of Bigfoot riding a unicorn into a pain-free sunset. Pure magic.

People say, “You can choose to be happy.” Right. And I can also choose to tightrope walk across the Grand Canyon in rollerblades while juggling flaming chainsaws. Doesn't mean it’s happening. But I’m still out here—no meds, no therapy platitudes, no vague ""have you tried yoga?"" advice. Just me and Fibro, co-starring in the tragicomedy of the year.

At the end of the day, I’m my own bestie, therapist, personal chef (barely), and emotional support goblin. Do I apologize for the mess? Nah. I wear it like a tiara made of sarcasm and spilled coffee.

So when I finally peace out of this mortal chaos, don’t cry. Throw a party. Blast my favorite songs loud enough to get a noise complaint. Eat cake for breakfast. I’ll be pain-free and probably haunting your Spotify algorithm from somewhere fabulous.

If you feel this level of abandonment? Congratulations—you’ve unlocked elite status in the chronic pain VIP club. Fibro may have jacked my health and ghosted my happiness, but it didn’t touch my dark humor or my ability to roast my own existence.

Here’s to the flaky friends, the dumpster fire days, and the rare ones that don’t make you want to scream into a pillow. Life is absurd, painful, and wildly unfair—but I’m still here, laughing like the punchline is me.",1,1754083415.0,Life,3,1.0,False

(Worthy Satire) - Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood, now 95 years young and fueled entirely by black coffee and raw grit, has made it clear he’s not riding off into the sunset anytime soon. “Retire? I don’t even know how to spell it,” Eastwood growled at reporters, before squinting so hard the microphone turned to dust.\
\
The “Dirty Harry” icon announced he’s prepping for his next film, tentatively titled Dirty Harry: Assisted Living Justice. In it, he’ll reprise his role as a no-nonsense cop who forgets where he parked his squad car but never forgets a perp’s face.\
\
Sources say Eastwood still insists on doing his own stunts—though now they mostly involve standing up without groaning or remembering why he walked into a room. “He wanted to fire a .44 Magnum, but we had to switch it out for a Nerf gun after the recoil dislocated his shoulder and cracked three ribs,” said one stunt coordinator.\
\
When asked what keeps him going, Eastwood simply muttered, “Criminals, liberals, and prune juice.”\

Stay tuned: rumor has it the sequel is already in the works—Gran Torino 2: Bingo Night Reckoning.\

Man Arrested Last Night on Suspected Drug Use After Claiming to Have Been Attacked By a “Monster”

We’ve received reports from last night by Bergen County Police of a man claiming to have been attacked by a monster in the comfort of his home. Police searched the house but found nothing. The man gives his statement below. 


A couple years ago there was a guy named Michael Bennett who died after being shot in a robbery at McDonald’s. Ever since then he’s haunted my dreams, chasing me and laughing insanely while saying “I’m gonna eat you” or “bring me your soul”. Most nights, I would dread going to sleep, and would try my best to stay up. One night, it was different than usual. I went to sleep and woke up with no nightmare. I thought to myself “maybe I’m still asleep haha” but no, I was fully awake. As I made my cup of coffee, I figured “maybe I got rid of him finally”. God, was I wrong. As my day progressed I felt like I'd have been being followed, and found myself constantly looking over my shoulder. When I got home from work I sat down and watched a little TV to help me wind down. That’s when all of a sudden I heard it. That sick, twisted, maniacal laugh. I quickly ran to the kitchen and saw the horror that only reflected on my facial expression. Michael was in my kitchen eating a chocolate cake and drinking a 2 liter of soda. “Get the fuck out of here” I yelled as I grabbed a knife from the knife block. “Ha ha ha ha ha what’s wrong? Afraid I’ll eat all your food?” he replied back. I lunged at him with the knife but I missed him entirely. “Uh oh someone missed!” he taunted as he stuffed his fat flabby face. “Go ahead try again and take your best fucking shot”. He started creeping towards me, gradually increasing his speed. “Get the fuck away from me” i yelled but he kept getting closer. “Gotcha!” he exclaimed as he jumped on top of me. I fought and kicked and punched him as hard as I could, trying to get him off of me but I felt my bones starting to give out. Eventually I got away from him , hiding in my bedroom but I could hear him climbing up the stairs and laughing. I tried to dial 911, but my phone died. Finally, I climbed out of my window just as he came into the room. I went next door to my neighbors house and called the police. Once they came they searched all around the house but found nothing except a trashed kitchen. “But he was there! I saw him!” I tried explaining but they just brushed it off as hallucinations from drug use. They arrested me because they thought I was on drugs. As I sit in the holding cell, I still hear his laughter at night and all I can do is laugh with him knowing he’s still out there waiting to eat someone’s food.

1mf8n8v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mf8n8v,Norway Coffee,"Spent 9 days in Norway, traveling through Oslo, Flåm, Bergen, and Ålesund. Definitely some great coffee shops out there. Sorted them from best to worst by city.

**Oslo**

*Tim Wndelboe* \- Incredible, absolutely get the hype. I went with the two coffee tasting, which is aeropress. Really tasty. My wife had the cold coffee, and it was probably the most tea-like coffee I've ever had, in the best way. Definitely my favorite shop of the trip. I really liked how simple the menu was as well. Props for only serving coffee too.

*Talormade* \- Very nice iced cortado

*Hakone Coffee* \- Good Japanese iced coffee. Had a chain feel to it, but it was still very good.

*Fuglen* \- Only had cold brew because their espresso machine closes 1 hour before closing. I'm not a big fan of cold brew, but they at least had cool decor and atmosphere.



**Flåm**

Flåm Bakeri - Pretty much the only spot to get espresso. Had a pretty decent cortado.

Train to Myrdal  - Had a black vending machine coffee. Really makes you appreciate good coffee.



**Bergen**

*Bergen Coffee Roastery* \- By far the best cortado of the trip, even though it was iced.

*Kaffemisjonen* \- Easily my second favorite shop of the trip. I ended up going twice, both times getting espresso.

*Det Lille Kaffekompaniet* \- Had a very nice cortado. They have a very good selection of local beans. They also have a really nice outdoor seating area.

*Blom* \- Good cortado. The highlight for me though was their iced mocha.

*Cornelius Sjømastrestaurant* \- Absolutely the most expensive cup of black coffee I've ever had, totally worth it though.



**Ålesund**

*Hotel 1904* \- Really good shakerato

Racoon Coffee - Very nice coffee with a great selection of pastries

*Jacu Coffee Roastery* \- Didn't get to try, as it was closed, but Racoon and Hotel 1904 both used their coffee



**Hotel Coffee**

*Clarion Hotel, The Hub -* Best hotel coffee, actually had an espresso machine with barista, using grocery store beans

*Hotel Norge by Scandic* \- Super automatic machine, oily dark roast beans

*Scandic Parken -* Worst super automatic machine, most stale beans, bitter as heck

  
Norway was a beautiful country that has a great appreciation for good coffee. I really liked that most drinks didn't use a ton of milk in most of their drinks, as I prefer my milk drinks to be more coffee forward.

My wife and I are sleeping on a foldout and are up early, so I can take it off and throw it away. I thought I was doing a great job until today.

We decide to wake up and get some coffee out as well as breakfast for the rest of the family. We're gone for about an hour or so and I'm stopping in the bathroom. I notice I left a diaper on the SINK. I had two kids up as well as my MIL and nobody noticed. Quickly thew it away and went on like normal. In my haste to get out the door I forgot to throw it away!

Anyway, this goes to show you that people really do notice less. My MIL knows I wear diapers, so she would have mentioned it, and while my kids don't know they would have yelled that they found someone's diaper.

The estimated delivery was originally July 30, and it’s now August 1 — still no tracking, no shipping confirmation, nothing.

Customer service initially told me there was a delay, then another agent issued a replacement order on July 28, but that also hasn’t shipped. I’ve spoken with multiple agents, and finally, a manager told me I should expect shipping between July 31 and August 2, but so far there’s no movement.

I’ve also contacted xBloom directly, but they say they can’t see my order since it was placed via Wayfair and not through their own system. Wayfair agents claim they cannot access any warehouse or inventory information, so every time I ask for an update, the answer is either “wait” or “cancel.”

Meanwhile, they did offer me a series of discounts due to the delay:
	•	9% off from a business promo
	•	10% off manually by agent
	•	20% first compensation
	•	another 20% for continued delay

Now I’m only paying ~$332 on a $599 machine (including tax), so I don’t want to cancel, but this situation is honestly ridiculous. It’s the worst Wayfair experience I’ve ever had.

Has anyone experienced something similar with Wayfair + xBloom recently?

I’ve emailed their leadership team. Any tips or advice from others who’ve been through this?

Thanks in advance 🙏

I moved a year ago from Germany and went for what I thought would be a regular annual check-up and cleaning at River Rock Dental (they have a 4.7/5 rating).

I was surprised because they did multiple scans and X-rays I wasn’t expecting, and then told me I have 12 cavities between my teeth, giving me a $3.5k treatment plan (insurance covers $1.5k).

On top of that, they sold me a “professional” Colgate toothbrush, floss, and toothpaste (also Colgate), but I’m not even sure how much I paid since it was bundled into the estimate.

What felt strange:

* I spent about 1 hour total, but only \~20 minutes with the dentist.
* Most of the work/check was done by an assistant, and there were two dentists switching between multiple rooms seeing several patients at the same time.
* Back in Germany, I’m used to one dentist (maybe one assistant), so this “multi-patient rotation” felt very different and kind of business-oriented.

For context:

* I brush twice a day (with Sensodyne Pronamel that my dentist in Germany suggested), don’t smoke, don’t drink soda or coffee, have no pain or visible holes.
* My last check-up in Germany (2.5 years ago) → dentist said everything was fine and just did a normal cleaning.
* In Germany, small “incipient” cavities are often just monitored and treated with better hygiene or fluoride, not drilled immediately.

Questions:

* Is this kind of approach (lots of X-rays, 12 cavities, $3.5k treatment plan) normal in the US for a first checkup?
* Is it common for dentists to work on multiple patients at the same time?
* Should I be worried or is this just a cultural difference?

Earlier this spring they kicked off a 3PL RFP and visited half a dozen 3PLs across the U.S. (of course, they found many of them through [**Third Person**](http://thirdperson.co/)). I was eager to get feedback on their visits.

My biggest takeaway was subtle, yet remarkable. 

Here’s the context: Imagine a client you’ve been courting has taken the time and incurred the expense to visit your warehouse facility. They are presumably a perfect fit for you. You’ve spent hours - weeks and months - mulling over the operational solution, preparing pricing, doing tech demos, etc. 

The prospect is now taking the time to visit you. What a dream! 

And let’s be real: traveling to rural parts of Jersey, Texas, Illinois, and Nevada isn’t an overly aspirational trip. 

The prospect is tired after flying across the country at an early hour and spending 45 minutes in an Uber from JFK, LAX, DFW or ORD. They show up to 1400 Industrial Way, they are lost in a Prologis industrial park with 8 bland, white look-alike buildings, each one with no fewer than 16 non-discrete glass doors around the perimeter of 1,000,000 square feet. 

Brand friends:  Does this sound familiar so far?!

3PLs spend all year trying to find only a small handful of qualified leads. They so often blow it during client prospect site visits, at a moment when the relationship is so warm. 

I’ve visited hundreds of 3PLs over my career. Yesterday’s conversation reminded me of the most important thing a 3PL can remember when a prospect is visiting: **First Impressions Matter.**

When a potential client steps through your warehouse doors for the first time, you have one chance to make a lasting impression. That initial facility visit can be the deciding factor between winning a new partnership and watching a prospect walk away to your competition. Mastering the art of the facility tour isn't just about showing off your space—it's about demonstrating your capability, professionalism, and commitment to becoming a trusted extension of their business.

Before your client arrives, preparation extends far beyond your warehouse floor. Start by coordinating their entire travel experience. Offer to arrange airport pickup in a professional black car service—this small investment demonstrates your attention to detail and commitment to their comfort. Provide travel tips, including local weather, recommended hotels, and restaurant suggestions near your facility (offering to take them out for a meal is an added bonus!)

Your facility should be operating at peak performance, with clean aisles, organized inventory, and equipment running smoothly. This isn't about putting on a show—it's about showcasing your SOPs. Review the client's specific needs beforehand and prepare to address their unique challenges during the tour.

Coordinate with your operations team to ensure key personnel are available for introductions. Nothing builds confidence like meeting the actual people who will be handling their products..

Prepare welcome materials including a branded folder with your company information, facility overview, and perhaps a small branded gift or local specialty item. These thoughtful touches show professionalism and help your company stay top-of-mind after they return home.

These additions emphasize that exceptional 3PLs think beyond just the warehouse tour—they create a complete experience that demonstrates their service philosophy from the moment a client considers visiting through their safe return home. This level of attention to detail sends a powerful message about how they'll handle the client's business if chosen as a partner.

The enhancements maintain the professional tone while showing how these ""extra touches"" aren't just nice-to-haves—they're strategic investments in building lasting partnerships and differentiating from competitors who might treat facility visits as routine operational tasks.

The moment your client arrives, they should feel welcomed and valued. If you've arranged transportation, ensure the driver knows to deliver them directly to your main entrance where you're waiting to greet them personally. Have a designated conference room or meeting area set up with refreshments— coffee, bottled water, and light snacks show hospitability without being excessive.

Present them with their welcome materials and provide an overview of what they'll see during the tour. This is your opportunity to understand their specific concerns and tailor the visit accordingly. If they've traveled from far away, acknowledge their effort to visit and express genuine appreciation for their time.

Consider small touches that reflect your local area or company culture. Perhaps locally roasted coffee, regional snacks, or company-branded items that serve as useful reminders of their visit. These details demonstrate thoughtfulness and help differentiate your organization from competitors who might treat facility visits as routine tours.

Present them with a brief company overview and safety briefing. Even if they're familiar with warehouse environments, demonstrating your commitment to safety protocols shows professionalism and care for their team members.

Introduce your prospect to key team members they'll work with, from account managers to operations supervisors. These personal connections matter immensely in building long-term partnerships. Let your team share their experience and expertise directly with the prospect. Often, these conversations reveal the depth of knowledge and dedication within your organization.

Discuss your training programs, safety initiatives, and employee retention strategies. Clients want to know their products will be handled by experienced, well-trained professionals who take pride in their work. Similarly, walk them through your expansion capabilities and contingency plans. Prospects need to know you can grow with their business and handle whatever challenges arise.

The most memorable facility visits include thoughtful extras that demonstrate your commitment to service excellence. Consider arranging lunch at a nice local restaurant or having quality catering brought in if the visit spans mealtime. This provides a relaxed environment for deeper conversation about their business needs and your capabilities.

If they're staying overnight, provide recommendations for dinner reservations and offer to arrange transportation. Follow up with a personalized thank-you note or email.

As the tour concludes, summarize what you've shown and connect it back to their specific needs. Provide them with relevant documentation, including certifications, insurance information, and references from similar clients. This supporting material reinforces the professional impression you've created during the visit.

Schedule follow-up meetings to address any additional questions and discuss proposal details. The facility visit should be the beginning of a deeper conversation about partnership, not the end of your sales process.

Too few 3PLs are focused on short term revenue, when they ought to be focused on the long term: **Building Partnerships, Not Just Winning Contracts**. Remember that successful 3PL relationships are partnerships that evolve over time. Your facility visit should communicate your commitment to continuous improvement and long-term collaboration. Clients are looking for partners who will invest in their success and adapt as their business grows and changes.

By approaching facility visits with thorough preparation, genuine transparency, and a focus on partnership building, 3PLs can transform these tours from simple walkthroughs into compelling demonstrations of their value proposition. The goal isn't just to impress—it's to build confidence that you're the right partner for their logistics needs.

1mf8ffg,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mf8ffg/im_a_serial_killer_and_something_is_poaching_in/,"I’m a serial killer, and something is poaching in my territory.","I’m not going to waste your time and pretend that I’m something I’m not. I kill people and I do because, for lack of a less crude way of saying this, it gets me off. Every aspect of the process does it for me. 

Frankly I live for the anticipation I feel as I make the preparations, the thrill as the life I choose to end does so in the way I want it to, and the satisfaction I get when I find a new way to dispose of and make use of the body. It’s really the only reason I get up out of bed. 

So I’m sure you can guess how LIVID it makes me when something messes with my ability to engage with my hobby. Which something currently is. I guess I should set the scene first.

I was in the downtown area of one of the three towns I frequent for potentials. Specially this cafe owned by a real bleeding heart. You see during the winter on Sundays they offer free coffee. So a lot of people unloved by mainstream society go there on Sundays during the winter. The homeless, runaways, poor people, and the other assorted easy to victimize folk. 

I was eyeing this one fent head who I knew had gotten kicked out of all the larger homeless camps. Well okay I assumed he was kicked out, I guess he could just willingly be camping out Old Jacob’s quarry alone, but I doubt it. That place is the oddest mixture of creepy and dangerous. I was really excited about how that atmosphere would add to the ambience of it all.

Anyway I waited a few minutes for him to leave, finished up my drink, and went to my car. After catching a glimpse of him going into the general direction of the quarry, I sped off back to my home to prepare. Sharpest pair of scissors I owned, a extra large garbage bag, stab vest to put under my coat, winter clothes I wouldn’t mind burning when this was done, and a flashlight with a working battery.

Once I double checked that I had everything I drove to a part of the woods within walking distance of the quarry. It was hard but I decided to take the scenic route, to give the man a chance to unwind and be easier to target. No reason to make it easy for the badge boys to catch me or to make it hard for me to snuff the addict out. Though in retrospect the woods being silent should have been a red flag. 

I mean I had been raised here my entire life and the only time I remember the woods being quiet is when a local bear had gotten rabid. Poor thing attacked anything in sight and wasn’t even aware enough to eat what it killed. Almost got a kid before it was put down. I should have at least been a bit more on edge, but in the end I was just too excited to be thinking logically. 

I was counting my steps so I can say with confidence that it took twenty four minutes before I reached the quarry. Finding the camp wasn’t all that hard, the addict hadn’t bothered to cover his tracks. Well I guess it’d be more accurate to say what was left of his camp. The place was wrecked and not in the ways homeless people normally leave things wrecked. 

The tent was torn up and the whole place was covered with charcoal from the makeshift fireplace. When I saw the blood I knew that I was going to be blue balled. Following it and seeing the body confirmed that.

Something had literally ripped the man into chucks, and I do mean ripped. You can’t get those kinds of tears by cutting. I thought about taking a picture. It was an objectively beautiful sight after all. But the heat I’d get if caught with it was too great a risk. After a few moments the realization that I was in danger hit me like a truck and I booked in back to my car. 

After putting everything back in its place, I took the time to think about what had happened, and decided that even if nothing happened to me I should lay low for a bit. Which I did and it was miserable by the way. The body was found a week later by some teens who went to Old Jacob’s for some local tradition. 

Every cop in the county was on high alert. Which infuriatingly meant I had to wait even longer to scratch the itch. I was considering going out anyway until found another body, shredded just like before. Then they found another one, and another one, and another one, and they just kept finding bodies. 

I was starting to get…scared. Because I noticed a pattern about where they were finding the bodies. See each body was getting closer and closer to my town. In fact when you put pins into where they found them on a map it kind of looked like it was heading to my house. A 
coincidence but a alarming one. That’s why I decided to post this really. I don’t want your help so don’t bother offering it. 

I guess I just wanted people to know what I had done and what was most likely going to do me in. Goodbye and know I didn’t regret a single thing.",5,1754082755.0,creepcast,2,0.78,False

No thoughts, no “feeling of worthlessness” like, nothing triggered this. I remember one week that was particularly bad. Every day. I woke up late (noon) or slept very little and stopped eating because eating made me feel worse. But even though I’m that type of teen that is always “aware” of what’s going on especially to my body or to my thoughts, it never crossed my mind that this was very unusual in my character. I tried to attribute it to not having any friends, being in online school, or hormones—the weather (?) I don’t know, anything. Boy, I would’ve never expected it wasn’t actually my fault.

So I get ms diagnosis. Depression comes again while im on steroids, and kinda “goes down” but still there afterwards.

I think I can say it now: MS made me obsessively think about Pml. I was that desperate, I was that wrong in my head that me, a smart teen would think PMl (which I have slim to none chances of getting), would somehow make this situation better.

I tanned. Drank coffee. Stayed up and stressed my body to extremes. I felt terrible. I got pseudo relapses, I was in a strange “depression state” all the time (but not that bad) and felt disconnected. Lost clarity of my mind.

I stopped because I realized how ridiculous I was and tried to get back into a routine again. Im so happy because even though all the problems in my life still exist, I can function a bit like myself now. It’s wonderful. But still, nobody deserves MS like this.",6,1754082506.0,MultipleSclerosis,1,1.0,False

I called them in May, after offering to help her multiple times and her sabotaging every effort and after contacting her GP 3 times. She always has an excuse.

She's always hoarded, but it's got much worse over the last 10 years, and particularly bad since my dad died 3 years ago.

Now her health is getting worse, which of course she's using as a reason why she can't sort out the hoard. She can't make the mental leap that she now won't be able to sort it out herself and she needs help from me or a 3rd party.

Social services managed to convince her in May to have a pendant alarm fitted after she had a fall, and she finally got rid of a fold-up bed with my late father's bodily fluids on which had been in the living room for 3 years. There's been no progress since then.

I called social services last week to update them, as they wanted to give her a few months to ""carry out what she had planned"". 

They called her today, but she has refused any further help. As she's seen as mentally 'there', there's nothing more they can do.

I know hoarding is a mental illness, I'm having therapy to deal with the effect this is having on me, but part of me had hope she would listen to social services, and finally she would turn a corner. I'm trying to meet her in neutral places, like a coffee shop, to have some kind of relationship with her.

1mf885p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mf885p/moth_boy_part_1/,Moth Boy [Part 1],"I’ve been reluctant to do this for many years. Friends and family have asked me to tell them about the Moth Boy for years, but I’ve declined. Perhaps they think I just have a creepy anecdote, or a fun factoid. Not a lot of people know I’ve been there since the beginning.

For reasons that will become apparent, I’ve been motivated to look closer at my experience with this person. Moth Boy. A stupid nickname. Funny, even. Like a sidekick to an insectoid superhero.

But I think we need to start at the very beginning.

 

The year was 2004. I was part of an investigation; a missing babysitter at a foster home. It was peculiar, but not necessarily sinister. We’d had some calls about that home in the past, but it was mostly just kids being kids. Neighbors complaining about noise and the occasional broken window.

This was different.

The foster home sheltered six kids from troubled backgrounds. The parents had to leave town for a family emergency and had paid for a pair of babysitters to help in the meantime. These weren’t just any babysitters either, they were friends of the family and well-known to the children. Familiar faces.

Let’s call her Vicky. Vicky had arrived at the house Thursday afternoon. She was to stay there until Sunday, when the other sitter would come by. Vicky was there to help with cooking, cleaning, keeping an eye on the kids, and making sure the older ones got to school okay. But when the other sitter arrived on Sunday, she found Vicky’s car still in the driveway – and the kids had been on their own since late Friday.

We were immediately called in. This was not just about a missing person; there was a full home of kids involved.

 

I have a background in child psychology. I was fresh out of college and had a penchant for westerns. I wanted to be the white hat who rode into town and cleared things up. Being a shoulder to lean on, and a hand to hold when the going gets tough. That wasn’t quite my job description, but what we do and what we *want* to do are rarely the same thing.

By the time I got to the Wheeler foster home, the place was packed with cars. The foster parents had come back just a couple of hours earlier, and it was full pandemonium inside. Some kids weren’t emotionally ready to be interviewed yet, and others didn’t know what was going on. Some of them had enjoyed being unsupervised. I could tell from one of the broken windows and the hockey puck on the driveway.

Police were searching the area, interviewing neighbors, knocking on doors for witness testimonies; whatever they had to do to find this girl. But the key to the puzzle were the kids themselves. Someone must have seen something. It was clear that she’d been there, so where did she go? When?

 

There were three boys and three girls. The oldest was 14, the youngest was 7. It was a nice place; a two-story house with plenty of space. Two rooms on the top floor for the kids where they bunked up three by three. A large living room on the bottom floor with double glass doors leading to a backyard. There was a trampoline and a deflated outdoor pool, waiting to be put away. A well-used ashtray on a white plastic garden table next to a grimy grill. Lighter fluid out in the open.

There were two smaller television sets in two of the kids’ rooms. An Xbox for the boys, a GameCube for the girls, both accompanied by well-worn and Cheeto-stained beanbags. It looked cozy; the kind of thing you’d have to pry a kid away from with bribes and promises. The place was a mess, but not a neglectful one. It was the kind of mess that shows life.

As I was walking through the boys’ room, I noticed a pitter-patter on the window. Looking a little closer, I saw moths. Not big ones, like the ones with eyes on the wings. No, these were smaller. One, maybe one and a half inch, at most.

“You noticed them too?”

One of my colleagues, Officer Norton.

“Found a couple in every room,” he continued. “They’re not native to the area.”

“Probably snuck along in a suitcase.”

“Or maybe they just attract that kind of attention.”

 

It was an unusual detail. Spongy moths, an invasive species. The Wheelers would probably have to get the exterminators; it was pretty serious. But invasive critters aside, there wasn’t much to say for Vicky’s disappearance. At least not at first glance. There was no sign of a struggle, and the kids had managed fine without her. They’d cleaned out the snack shelf and eaten two full boxes of ice cream sandwiches, but apart from a stomachache they’d be fine.

I would begin my interviews later that day. All under supervision, and with the foster parents in the next room, of course. I would try to build some rapport with the children, mentioning how I noticed their games and telling them of some of my own. I asked about their favorite shows, how they were doing in school, and what their favorite things to do around the house was. All little talking points to put things in perspective. It was all preliminary.

Most of them were fine talking to me. Happy, even. There was this younger girl, Hayden, who blasted off into this long rant about her friends at school and the many things she wanted to do when she grew up. It’s like she just needed an excuse, and she was off to the races. Others, like 7-year-old Brandon, found the whole thing unpleasant. He couldn’t bring himself to speak. But after a couple of bribes and some time to warm up, he confided in me;

“I think Herman did it,” he said. “Herman’s a weird one.”

 

Herman. That’s the name people see in the papers. Not Moth Boy. Herman.

10-year-old Herman was the newest member of the Wheeler foster home, having been there only half a year. The first time I saw him, he was sitting in the corner of the living room, lodged between a TV bench and a bookshelf. If you didn’t know where to look, you’d barely notice him. He was quite large in stature for a kid his age. He had this sandy blonde hair with gray eyes. I could see them all the way across the room. He had this expression of a cat on the prowl, with eyes wide open and pupils wide.

He was just sitting there, staring ahead, as another moth tapped on the window to my right.

“Hey there, Herman,” I said, walking up to him. “You mind talking to me for a bit?”

I held out a hand and introduced myself. Herman shook it, and I felt this intense warmth. Then, movement. A twitch. I pulled back, only to see he’d put a caterpillar in my hand. The thing had these cactus-like spikes digging into my skin as it rolled back and forth. My hand flared up like I’d been stung by a wasp.

I dropped the caterpillar and crushed it. Herman didn’t seem to mind. His expression didn’t change.

 

I tried to have a conversation with him, but he didn’t respond. It was only later that evening that I learned from one of the older girls that Herman didn’t speak. Not just as in he spoke quietly – he never spoke *at all*. I asked his foster parents about it, and they mentioned him being an unusual case.

“We don’t know what happened before he came to us,” they explained. “They just found him.”

I don’t know where my instincts come from, but I felt something. We weren’t going to find Vicky with a thorough search or a surprise witness at the 11^(th) hour. No, we had an answer in Herman. I don’t know why, but something was telling me that behind those gray doll-like eyes was an answer.

I remember leaving the Wheeler home with a strange gut feeling. It was like an anxious stone in the pit of my stomach. Like I’d seen something awful, but my mind was playing catch-up with my eyes.

I saw Herman in the window of the second floor, looking my way. And even from a distance, I could see three moths fluttering around him. I waved goodbye, but he didn’t wave back.

 

I think it was officer Norton who first characterized him as “Moth Boy”. He said something akin to;

“We talked to every kid in there and got *nothing*. Well, not moth boy. We didn’t talk to him.”

Herman was suspected to be the cause of the moth infestation in the Wheeler home. They’d begun to show up around the time of his arrival, and they were apparently very common around spaces where he spent the most time. Hence the Moth Boy moniker. It caught on.

Even after one visit to the Wheeler home, I’d start to find larvae in my clothes. Mostly my pockets. These little black segmented things, waving their bodies back and forth like pool noodles. I dropped everything I wore into the dryer just to make sure I got them all, but I still had chills for the rest of the night. Like I could feel them on my body. And looking at the swelling on my hand, I knew these things would be a problem if they made a foothold.

 

Vicky was still missing. The search area was expanded, with a particular focus on the nearby interstate. The current working theory was that she was either coaxed out of the house and kidnapped, or left with someone willingly. There was no working theory as to what exactly would have made her do that. She had a boyfriend, but he was out looking for her just like everyone else.

The next day we took a more structured approach. I was part of a team of people who were interviewing the kids one by one in greater detail. I got the three boys, while one of my colleagues got the three girls. We tried to create a calming environment, using our most colorful rooms and a couple of toys and comics to make it all look a bit more friendly.

First one I sat down with was 12-year-old Sal. Latin American kid with his head on a swivel. I could tell he didn’t want to be there, his eyes kept rolling at me like a bobblehead. I asked him about Vicky, about when she went missing, what they did when they noticed she was gone – and he wasn’t very receptive to the topic.

“We played games,” he said. “We had cold pizza and sandwiches.”

It wasn’t until I mentioned the other boys that I saw a tinge of something uncertain in his face. He didn’t have much to say about Brandon, more than that he was “cool”, but talking about Herman was a whole other thing.

 

Sal looked down when I mentioned him. He didn’t roll his eyes or shrug the question off.

“You have a good relationship with Herman?” I asked.

“No,” Sal said. “No one does.”

“Why do you say that?”

“He’s a freak.”

“What makes him a freak?”

Sal leaned back and crossed his arms. And without looking up, he seemed to open a little.

Sal had been with the Wheelers for four years. Ever since Herman showed up, things had changed. William, the father figure of the home, had started smoking. Julia, on the other hand, had started day-drinking.

“Not a lot”, Sal clarified. “But you notice. It’s the stress.”

 

Sal described Herman as ‘creepy’. He explained in detail how he’d notice Herman skulking around the house when people slept, or when he thought no one was looking. Herman would never eat at the dinner table, instead packing his food into a Tupperware box and running away.

“And the bugs,” Sal said, shaking his head. “They’re gross, and they sting. I gotta vacuum my bed once a week. They changed mattress three times, but they keep coming back.”

Herman would never smile. He would never talk.

“Have you seen anyone bully him?” I asked. “A lot of kids like that get bullied.”

“Once,” Sal said. “I saw someone pushing him into a puddle. But they don’t do that anymore.”

“Why not?”

Sal shook his head, trying to find the words.

“It was months ago. Herman hit him with a water balloon. There was blood in it.”

I wanted to ask, but I could tell there was more. Sal took a deep breath, looking up from the floor. He didn’t want to talk anymore. At least not about Herman.

Brandon had similar stories. Herman seemed to have no filter. They’d once seen him dangling a rattlesnake by the tail, playing with it. He would poke around little insect nests, hoping to attract venomous spiders. Even things like barbecue could be made creepy, as Herman would admire the sizzling meat – but not out of hunger. He just seemed to like the sound. One of few things that made him happy, it seemed. Very happy.

“He spent two days with a branch once,” Brandon said. “He took his shoelaces, wrapped them around it, and tugged. Like he was practicing.”

“Practicing what?”

“Strangling things.”

 

Before my interview with Herman, I looked up a couple of things from his file. His original family had abandoned him and changed their names. He had been found wandering the highway by patrolmen, and efforts to find his biological parents failed. No one came to claim him. Even the name Herman was a temporary placeholder that kinda stuck around. It was no more valid than his ‘Moth Boy’ nickname.

Herman did go to school but was part of a special education program. He seemed to pay attention in class, but they couldn’t get him to perform any tests or measurements. He wouldn’t play, and he wouldn’t respond when spoken to. They knew he could read and write, but it was hard to say at what level. He would usually draw. There were those suggesting he was on the autistic spectrum, but he didn’t seem to respond negatively to sudden or changing stimuli. In fact, he rarely responded to anything at all.

So before my interview, I prepared some paper and crayons. If Herman didn’t talk, maybe he would draw.

 

Herman arrived with little fanfare. His foster father waited outside, having a cigarette. Herman sat down across from me, folded his hands, and looked at me from across the table. He paid no attention to the paper and crayons. Just as I was about to ask him a question, I noticed him rubbing his arms.

“Are you cold?” I asked.

He nodded. I fetched my jacket and wrapped it over him. He didn’t smile, but he stopped moving.

“Better?”

Again, he nodded. I sat down across from him and pushed the stack of papers closer, along with the box of crayons. Now that I’d made it apparent that it was okay to use them, he immediately picked the red and black crayons.

“I’d like to ask about your babysitter Vicky,” I said. “Do you know anything about where she went?”

Herman didn’t acknowledge the question. Instead, he looked at the paper, then back up at me. He made a motion like he wanted something to drink, and then used a crayon to show a straw. It wasn’t much, but at least he was communicating.

 

I returned with a glass of lemonade; with a straw. Herman put the crayons down and sipped the straw, looking me straight in the eye with every gulp. Those gray, doll-like eyes.

“When was the last time you saw Vicky?” I asked. “Do you remember what she was doing?”

He nodded at me again, grabbing the black crayon. I thought he was about to draw something, but he wrote in all capital letters;

*VERY HAPPY*

“She was happy last time you saw her?”

He shook his head, pointing to himself.

“You were happy the last time you saw her?”

He nodded, and added the word *COOKING* to his paper.

“So she was cooking.”

Herman nodded enthusiastically.

“Then what happened?”

He thought about it for a while. Then he added the words *WENT HOME*. Curious.

 

I didn’t get much else from Herman. But from what I’d learned, Vicky had been cooking something and then ‘went home’. Of course, Herman couldn’t know that. Maybe he misinterpreted her leaving for her going home, giving some leniency to the working theory of her disappearing along the interstate.

I thought a lot about it as I drove home that night. There was still no word about Vicky and her whereabouts, but I shared my findings with the investigators. There wasn’t much to share; the children had been too preoccupied with their own antics and games to consider what had happened. They weren’t mean about it, but they’d been too busy to notice her absence until she was already gone. Now that she was missing, they all expressed concern about it. The girls had put on this friendship bracelet that Vicky helped them make.

Some of the officers involved with the case talked at length about the strange ‘Moth Boy’ of the Wheeler house. Not only were there plenty of rumors surrounding him, but they kept talking about him as if he was somehow responsible. He was a creepy kid; of course he had to be the source of trouble. That had to be it.

“He’s big for his age,” one of the officers noted. “Wouldn’t surprise me one bit.”

“He ain’t all there, that’s for sure.”

I wanted to say something, but I didn’t. I hadn’t made up my mind yet.

 

Coming home that night, I felt a strange warmth along my neck. The warmth turned to a searing heat, making me throw off my jacket, dropping it flat on my bathroom floor. I hadn’t even closed the front door.

And there they were, on the floor. Spongy moth larvae. Not just a couple, but dozens. Maybe hundreds. Shaking out the jacket, small balls of paper and chewed bread rolled out; something Herman had rolled up and planted in the jacket lining. He’d poked a hole in the inner left pocket and dropped the balls in there, making them almost impossible to notice.

That’s why he asked for the jacket. Not because he was cold, but because he wanted to plant these. I spent two hours steam-cleaning the bathroom. Exhausted, I sat down on my toilet, only to spot three more larvae along the trim of the walls. I had scrubbed, and steamed, and scrubbed again, and yet there they were. Just a couple, but more than enough.

It was long after 1 am when I called it a night. I’d put the jacket into a plastic bag, taken it outside, and burned it. And as I lay down to sleep, I kept waking up; imagining the pitter-patter of wings along the glass of my bedroom window.

 

The investigation continued for a couple of days. There was a lead about a woman looking like Vicky being caught on a camera at a gas station, but it turned out to be a false positive. Being back to square one, things started to look dim.

I managed to get some time with the foster parents, asking them about their experiences and suspicions. Turns out, Herman was the most immediate problem for the couple to tackle. They talked about how he’d bring them endless stress, and the constant cleaning needed to handle the moths was exhausting.

“I have no idea where they’re coming from,” the foster mother sighed. “It’s not the clothes, they’re washed three times a week. The kids aren’t dirty, they all shower daily. And yet, every day, something comes crawling out.”

The foster father had a different idea.

“He hides them,” he said. “Herman hides them. I’m telling you.”

 

We had a talk with the other babysitter. She ping-ponged between hysterical and cordial, making it hard to keep a coherent conversation. She painted this picture of Vicky as a promising young woman. Someone making extra money to get a place of her own as she went to nursing school. Vicky seemed perfectly pleasant, and there was no reason for anyone to hurt her. Sadly, that just meant she was more likely to be a victim.

The working theory was that her boyfriend had done something. Turns out he’d been lying about his whereabouts on Friday evening. Police were looking for him to bring him in for questioning, but he wasn’t officially charged with any crimes; yet. But there were signs that pointed in a very familiar direction.

It was possible, but then someone would have noticed. Sure, the kids were all about games and staying up all night, but not Herman. He *must* have seen something.

 

One late afternoon, I was writing up a summary for my supervisor. I had to wear some backup clothes, as the rest was in the dryer back home. I had this uncomfortable starchy shirt. It chafed in ways you don’t expect it to. I was about to finish up for the day when I got a call on my office phone.

I answered, introduced myself, and heard nothing. There was someone on the other end, but they didn’t say anything. I was suddenly aware of my breathing, like I could feel the hot air brush against the receiver.

“Is anyone there?” I asked.

There was a huffing noise. I furrowed my brow and listened. I could hear voices in the background. Children. But there was something else. Paper?

“Herman? Is that you?”

Two taps – a crayon against paper.

“Are you okay? Do you need something?”

Two taps.

“Can you give the phone to an adult? We’ll figure it out.”

One tap.

“Do you need help? Should we send someone?”

Two taps.

“Alright, someone’s coming. Hang tight.”

One immediate tap. He didn’t like that.

“Not that,” I clarified. “Alright. You want me to come?”

Two taps, clear as day.

 

I drove out there with two other officers. I didn’t mind racking up some overtime, but I could feel my skin itching at the thought of spending time with Moth Boy. It was like a Pavlovian response. I could feel something crawling across the hair on my arms, and I couldn’t tell if it was the late summer breeze or something about to sting me. Just thinking about it put me on edge, making my leg shake like I’d had too much coffee.

I arrived at the Wheeler house with a patrol vehicle. Officer Norton and his partner were my backup, staying a solid five steps behind with a practiced smile. The Wheelers were already up front. So was Herman, with a backpack.

“I’m so sorry,” said mama Wheeler. “We didn’t notice him calling until he hung up.”

“That’s fine,” I smiled. “I’m glad he feels comfortable talking to me.”

The foster father rolled his eyes. Perhaps that’s where Sal learned it.

“Did you want to talk, Herman? Is that it?”

Herman shook his head, holding up a paper. He’d scribbled the word *WALK*.

“Walk the walk, not talk the talk,” I said. “You wanna go somewhere?”

He nodded. The parents didn’t seem to mind, but there was a definite worry on their faces. Perhaps they weren’t used to Herman making a scene like this, or even communicating at all. I waved Herman over, but he shook his head. He knelt on the ground and dove in with his crayon Seconds later, he showed me a muddy paper. The new word was rough, but clear.

*ALONE*

Officer Norton kept a smile up, but I could tell he didn’t like it. Moth Boy was just a kid, but in some other way, he wasn’t.

 

Herman and I made our way on our own, following a trail leading past a bike road. We moved between houses, tracing a path that only a kid could figure out. A birds-eye route straight through a busy residential area. Herman kept his head down with steely-eyed determination.

“Do you have something to show me?” I asked, stepping over a white picket fence.

Herman nodded, pointing straight ahead.

“Is it about Vicky?”

He nodded again. Perhaps he knew who’d taken her, or a clue as to where she went. The thought struck me that I might have to come face to face with whoever was responsible. I had my service weapon, but I hadn’t considered that I might have to use it. Then again, Herman was a weird kid. Maybe he just wanted to show me a cool stick, or a treehouse.

 

We finally made it to our destination – a two-story house in a slightly nicer part of town. It was about a twenty-minute walk, but it would have taken twice as long if we’d taken a less optimal path. Herman stopped and held up a hand, asking me to wait while he wrote something down. As he did, I looked over at the house.

“Nice place,” I said. “You know the owners?”

Herman nodded, showing me his paper. It said *CHECK POOL*. He underlined it and pointed to the side of the house. Something in his demeanor had shifted, but it was hard to tell what. He wasn’t scared or angry. Not happy either. But there was a new eagerness there – something urgent. I followed his direction, taking point. It looked like the owners were out; there were no cars in the driveway. Late summer vacation, perhaps.

We followed the side of the house, opening into a big backyard. A large wooden deck with a scattering of folded sun chairs. Intricately detailed garden bushes barely clinging to life with an automated sprinkler. In the back, a gazebo - overlooking a pool covered with a tarp. It had this tacky corporate sunflower logo in a clear, sun-washed blue.

There was a security camera facing the backyard. I had to take that into consideration, maybe it’d caught someone. I could tell something was off, but I couldn’t put my finger on what. There was this cat across the yard that stared at us like it was about to attack. Perhaps it could feel the same tension that I did. But was it scared of me, or the infamous Moth Boy?

I looked back at Herman. He nodded, pointing to the pool and poking at the tarp. I pulled it back.

 

I was hit by this thick, acrid smell. Something so dense and instant that it felt like I’d swallowed a wad of charred hair. I reeled back, wheezing for air. The pool had been drained, leaving a hollow space of ceramic tiles. It almost looked like the water was still there, as the blue tint of the sunflower logo gave the light a watery twist.

There was something at the deep end. Something black. I could hear a strange noise coming from it, but I couldn’t tell what it was. A droning hiss, like a white noise machine. Buzzing.

I moved to the side, looking down. I couldn’t tell what it was, even now. Maybe I didn’t want to understand.

“What is this?” I asked. “How did you find it?”

I looked up at Herman. He’d written two words.

*VICKY. COOKING.*

 

My heart sank through my stomach as I noticed the details. The curled fingers. Legs popped like overcooked sausages. And there, if you looked at just the right angle – a skull, locked in a mouth-wide scream. I could see the edge of her spine poking through her burned clothes.

I yelled at Herman to move away and made my way down the pool ladder. I had my phone in my hand before I realized what I was doing. I had to get backup. I had to get backup *now*. My thoughts raced as my poor excuse for shoes almost lost me my footing on the slippery tiles. I called out for Officer Norton, trying to tell him the address. I knew the street, but the number wasn’t making sense to me. The only number I could think of was four – the number of teeth I could see sticking out from the charred remains.

“We have a body,” I repeated. “We have a body. A body. And I don’t know if-“

A trickle. Something wet. Rain? Couldn’t be. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky.

 

Herman was standing at the edge of the pool. He was holding a bottle of lighter fluid. In his other hand; a zippo lighter. The flame was lit. Even as I looked at him, he continued pouring. My eyes burned as the chemicals made their way up my nose.

“Herman,” I said. “What are you doing?”

He dropped the bottle unceremoniously, reaching for his scrunched-up paper. Still holding the lighter, he tapped a word. *COOKING*.

“Are you gonna hurt me, Herman?”

He nodded.

“I didn’t do anything to you,” I said. “I thought we were friends.”

I tried to keep my words simple, but it felt wrong talking to him like that. This was no ordinary kid – you couldn’t reason with him. He didn’t listen the way others did, and he didn’t care. Even looking at the charred remains of his babysitter, there was no visible reaction. He might as well have watched the clouds go by.

“Herman,” I said. “I need you to step back. Others are coming soon. I’m on the phone with them right now. This is very serious.”

But he didn’t step back. He didn’t put out his lighter. I could promise him a house swarming with police officers, and he wouldn’t bat an eye. Because by the time they got there, he would’ve already won.

 

I pulled out my gun.

Never in a thousand years had I thought I’d be pointing it at a kid, but I did.

“Put it away, now,” I snapped. “Do it!”

The flame stayed lit, and he wasn’t budging. He stretched his arm out, holding the lighter with two fingers like a dainty dame with a fine cup of tea. Safety was off. I could do it. One wrong pull of a muscle, and I’d be the man who shot a 10-year-old.

“Last chance!” I demanded. “Last chance, Herman!”

My legs were shaking. I could feel a cramp coming on as my muscles tensed up. My mouth was wide-open, sucking in air like a funnel.

He dropped the lighter.

 

My mind split in two. In one world, I shot Herman in the head. In the other, I dove to forward catch the lighter before it hit the ground. They were both valid options, but something in the world pushed me towards the second reality. Perhaps in some other place, the outcome would have been different.

I missed the lighter, but it didn’t matter. It landed with the top down, closing itself with a click.

For a couple of seconds, I just lay there next to the charred remains. My world was nothing but chemicals and coal. I couldn’t get my body to stop shaking. I’d been the flick of a lighter from going up in flames.

I brushed away an insect, then another one. It didn’t take me long to realize that Vicky was infested with them. And there, around her neck, something burned but unmistakable.

Shoelaces.

 

I climbed out of the pool. Herman was just sitting on a sun chair with his papers, writing. The cat had made its way across the yard and curled up by his feet. I didn’t even realize I was still holding my gun. I figured I could still do it, if I wanted to. One pop, and a lot of drama would be over. This wasn’t just a kid, he was something else entirely. Something I’d only read about in solemn worst-case scenario profiles during training. Perhaps I’d be doing everyone a favor.

Before I could say anything, Herman showed me another thing he’d written.

*VERY HAPPY*

Of course he was. There were sirens in the distance, and he couldn’t care less.

“You killed her.”

He nodded.

“Why?”

He thought about it for a second. He turned to his papers, making a few practiced strokes. He gave the paper to me; a smiley face. No words, this time.

I escorted him to the front of the building to meet up with the officers. As we walked, I felt something. He was holding my hand. Not to plant a caterpillar in my palm, but because hands is what kids are supposed to do. They were supposed to hold people’s hands when the going gets tough. That’s what Moth Boy was working with; assumptions. I think that’s the first moment I saw him for what he truly was; a pretender.

Until the moment those flashing lights came around the corner, I contemplated pulling the trigger. Like I had some cosmic option to end lifetimes of pain.

But I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

 

The aftermath was awful.

There was the fallout of the family being informed, but also the devastation of the Wheeler foster home. Not to mention the house where Vicky had been burned. Remember I mentioned Moth Boy having been bullied once? Yeah, the kid who did that? It was his family house. They had to move, they couldn’t stay in a house where someone had been burned.

And yes, she’d been alive. There was a security camera overlooking the backyard. Herman had tricked Vicky there, showing her some text on a piece of paper. As they got to the edge of the pool, he held up a necklace with a shiny rock. Vicky had clapped her hands excitedly and turned around for him to put it on. As she did, he switched the necklace for his shoelaces. Then he struck.

He did some real damage in those first few seconds. Herman is larger than most kids his age, and Vicky was smaller than the average adult woman. After a short struggle, she stumbled into the empty pool, and Herman let her go. Using the lighter fluid from his foster father’s grill, and a zippo lighter, the camera showed a sudden burst of light.

And Herman just stood there. Very happy.

 

I didn’t stay up to date with the court rulings that came after that. I heard he was locked away. I just wanted him out of my life. Thinking about him reminded me that I was the kind of person who’d shoot anyone to save myself. It put this stain on my mind, like I was the most selfish person in the world. I kept Herman’s smiley face paper as a reminder. I don’t know why. Maybe to torture myself.

For weeks after last seeing him, I would still get these incessant moths fluttering around my apartment. They would stay there for a couple years until I moved to a new apartment. I think it took two full years before I finally got rid of them. I’d hoped that would be a turning point, making me forget the Moth Boy once and for all. And I guess, for a while, it worked.

But it wouldn’t last. Because much like his namesake, Herman was impossible to truly get rid of.

I sort of knitted together the formats of a few different folks' timelines to create this one above. I love this format, so I hope it is helpful for someone else...

Additionally, if you could provide any feedback on the timing and logistics then that would be great! Some things worth noting:

* Bridal Party and Bride's parents are staying at the venue
* We are not doing a First Look, so I want to stagger the men and women setting up the reception hall so we don't cross paths. 
* We don't have access to the chapel until 1:00pm (ceremony starts at 2:00pm)
* We're doing passed apps during cocktail hour and buffet dinner at 5:00pm for about 80-100 people with about 10 kids
* There is a coffee shop on the short walk over from chapel to venue, so that is where the bride/groom/photographer will take a quiet break.
* I don't have the caterer schedule yet but they will be there from opening to close

Some concerns:

* Too much morning prep time? Too much waiting around to get antsy?
* Enough photo time? (There's three sets of parents, 7 siblings and their families, one grandma)
* We currently have the photographer booked for only 6 hours but my schedule shows more. I just didn't want them to leave as the party/dancing is getting started so considering buying another hour of time
* It's a really cute/touristy coastal town with shops and a playground but I wonder if the guests still have too much ""waiting around"" time

It helps us figure out where we might be stretched too thin and where a little attention could go a long way in helping us feel more steady, supported, and whole.

**What It Covers**

It typically covers eight areas of life:

* **Physical Health**: Exercise, nutrition, hydration, and sleep habits.
* **Mental Health**: Stress management, mindfulness, life coaching, and therapy or counseling.
* **Emotional Health**: Self-awareness, emotional regulation, relationships, and support systems.
* **Spiritual Health**: A sense of meaning, purpose, and connection to something greater than yourself (which could be nature, community, or personal values, even the tree in your front yard if that’s what it takes to get out of your head).
* **Financial Health**: Managing income, expenses, budgeting, and addressing debt. (Yikes on bikes, I know).
* **Personal Growth**: Engaging in learning, hobbies, creative expression, or skill-building.
* **Family & Relationships**: Healthy boundaries, supportive connections, and relational dynamics.
* **Work/Career**: Job satisfaction, purpose, and alignment with skills or interests.

Now, I want you to put on your imagination hats (and if you just pictured SpongeBob with a rainbow over his head going, *“Imaaagiinaaation,”* you’re my people).

But let’s switch gears from sea sponge to pizza. Preferably New York-style, because it’s the best. Yeah, I said it.

Now picture each life category as its own slice of that delicious, cheesy pie. You’re going to rate each slice…um, area…on a scale from 1 to 10 (or visually shade in segments of a wheel diagram) based on how satisfied you feel in that part of your life. 

The result? A visual snapshot of your life’s balance and insight into which areas feel balanced and which feel depleted or neglected. Here’s an example of a blank one:

**How It Helps in Recovery and Healing**

Recovery isn’t just about staying sober, and healing isn’t just about getting better. They are about rebuilding a life that feels *worth* staying that way.

Sometimes that means realizing:

* Your friendships need nurturing
* Your finances are stressing you out
* You haven’t had fun since MTV only played music videos

You have to keep tending to the garden of your healing and recovery, pulling weeds at the root, fertilizing, watering, and making sure everything’s getting the attention it needs to grow and thrive. So, if a flood (of emotions) or drought (neglect) happens, you can manage it. 

**Benefits of Using It**

* **Increased Awareness**: Provides a clearer picture of how different life areas are impacting recovery and healing.
* **Goal Setting**: Offers a practical starting point for creating meaningful personal goals.
* **Motivation**: Encourages small, focused actions that can build momentum.
* **Improved Communication**: Can be a helpful tool to express needs and priorities to therapists, sponsors, accountability partners, or loved ones.
* **Support for Long-Term Sobriety and Healing**: Reinforces the idea that recovery and healing aren’t just about abstaining from unhealthy behaviors and thoughts. It’s also about building a life that feels worth staying healthy for.

**How to Use It**

**Here’s how to do your  Life Wheel check-in:**

**Step 1:**  
Look at the eight life categories in the wheel:

* Physical Health
* Mental Health
* Emotional Health
* Spiritual Health
* Financial Health
* Personal Growth
* Family & Relationship
* Work/Career

**Step 2:**  
Give each category a rating from 1–10.

**Step 3:**  
Connect the dots or visually shade them in to see your wheel. Don’t worry if you have a bumpy, jagged shape. It doesn’t mean you’re failing. It means you’re a work in progress. We all are. Now you have information on what areas you can focus on and improve and expand upon. Don’t panic! You don’t have to do it all at once, so let go of that stress breath you sucked in. You got this!

**Reflect With These Prompts**

For each category, ask:

* What am I doing well here?
* Where do I feel stuck?
* What’s one small step I could take this week?

For example:  
**Category: Friends**  
Doing well: I have my Sober Circle/Healing Hive I can text when I’m struggling.  
Need improvement: I’ve been isolating a lot lately.  
Small step: Schedule one coffee or walk with a friend.

**What’s Next**

Once areas for growth are identified, you can:

* Set specific, achievable goals.
* Seek support from professionals, peers, or loved ones.
* Develop healthier routines or boundaries.
* Reinvest in areas that have been neglected, like hobbies, rest, or relationships.

1mf7vhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mf7vhc/stop_looking_for_the_paranormal/,Stop Looking For The Paranormal.,"Hello, I don't know how to properly explain this, but I have an addiction. I know how that sounds, but what I say is different from what most people say when they have an addiction though, they'll usually go to a program or get help, or just say screw it and continue to spiral into their vices. I fall somewhere in between. My addiction runs deep, since I was a kid with a neglectful/workaholic parent and too much free time on the internet in the early 2000's. Before I continue my name is Corey, and my path of cryptids and things that went bump in the night started with unrestricted internet access in about 2010 with two very important pieces of media, one being a thick book hidden away in my elementary school library called ""Weird Ohio”, and when I came across a video series called Marble Hornets. 

To make a long story short of it, I was hooked. I watched every video from the series, listened to every creepypasta I could get my hands on, read up on scps  and even convinced my blue collar father to buy me one of those at the time seventy dollar handheld cam-recorders so I could make videos in my neighborhood. All of this is to help you get an understanding of where I'm coming from and how these communities I interacted with helped to shape me as I grew up.

Growing up in Ohio as a “creepypasta kid”, it was surprising just how little I was bullied for it back in the day, but that could be chalked up to either my downplaying it and masking my “weirder” interests with things like halo and left 4 dead, or that the town I grew up in was pretty weird already(p.s, if you're ever in Ohio and find yourself in Tuscarawas County, go visit the warlocks grave). But for all my oddities and interests, it led me to a small encounter when I was eleven years old. 

It started innocent enough, I was on my winter break and as a 5th grader with too much social media influence and no supervision, I did what I assumed almost no one else my age was doing and grabbed an oversized hoodie, a nerf blaster, and my camera before making my way out the door and into the snow covered neighborhood to “hunt for creepypastas”. I should clarify it right now, I was a child. Barely double digits and as much as I cringe to myself as I write this I want to effectively explain why little moments like these have led to some of the decisions I made years later down the line. Around my house was a river with trees that I used as a makeshift hideout during nerf battles with my friends, and a road that went up a wooded hill into a hiking trail that everyone in my neighborhood believed to be home to several scary characters, like the Seed Eater and Slenderman himself.

With my camera in hand and an empty nerf gun, I first trekked through the hard snow towards the river, making sure the Rake or another scary entity hadn't snuck in to steal any of my rotting wooden chairs or secret stash of darts, not really considering they would have no use for either of those things. Walking back towards my house and patrolling the streets I found myself standing at the base of the hill, staring up into the snow covered trees that seemed so intimidating at my young age, I flipped open the screen to my camera and started to record myself going up the hill.


Now, despite this being my “first” encounter with something I couldn't really explain, I haven't the clearest memory of how I got so lost and turned around up there, only that I remember being on my knees in the snow as I desperately tried to wipe snot off my face as I cried. That's when I saw them, though. In-between the tears and fear of being lost I can remember looking up and just about twenty to thirty feet down the hill stood three individuals.

They were blurry, I remember that, but that could have been because of the tears that clouded my vision. I can also remember that despite the distance between me and them, their voices called out in a whisper. Do you ever remember the feeling of having a parent talk softly as you want to sleep? It was like that. Their voices were soft and comforting, and by the time I had stopped crying I had found myself at the start of the trail, my face wiped of snot and tears, and my camera in my hand. I can remember going back home and not even realizing I was out for most of the day, opening the screen door and greeted with the angered voice of my father saying it was dinnertime, and that he had looked for me everywhere in the neighborhood. I was too scared to tell him what happened, so I remember lying and saying I was at “the new kids house”.

I don't remember what became of that camera, as I've moved to 3 different states since then. Looking back on it now, it seemed more likely it was a case of “Third Man Syndrome”, if you're unfamiliar with it, it's when missing people or people in situations like a car wreck report a voice or person guiding and helping them to safety. Though whether that was the case or not, it was my first taste of something unusual happening to me.

All of that is to say, despite the small experiences I had growing up, I know for sure that what happened around my eighteenth birthday was supernatural in nature.

To help set the scene, it was early June in 2020 and I was living in a small town in Southern Colorado, which as a then freshly graduated high-schooler the world pandemic put a bit of a hold on things like college. What didn't get put on hold though was the military, which is where I introduce you to my friends Morgan, Jade, Casey and Henry. Morgan, Henry and Jade were enlisting into the Marines, while Casey was going into the navy, which was kinda ironic given that I was 6 '1, and he had a good three inches on me, though with how lanky he was and the way he kept his blond hair short, he fit right in.

Another small note to add, with all of our shared interests, each of us had had some sort of experience with the paranormal.

Ever since the start of my senior year, me and my friends had formed a pretty tight bond, so much so that we would spend the weekends at Henry's, with Saturday for PT(Physical Training), coffee from a small plant shop, and then gaming or whatever shenanigans that lasted until Sunday evening when we all went home. The reason I explain this is that one Saturday Casey finally found out his ship date, and it was before my 18th birthday. Now, being the youngest of my friend group by only a few months meant I was the “kid” of the group, despite the fact that Henry's birthday was two months ago. Casey, being the big macho man he had been puffing himself up to be, decided that we should celebrate before he heads out, and as such made a plan for the weekend of the 12th as the time to celebrate.

When the day arrived, I remember being in my room watching as the clock on my phone ticked the minutes by, my futon groaning as the cheap and slightly broken metal frame held me up as i had eagerly awaited a message back from my friends, trying my hardest not to dwell on the self-conscious feelings of being ignored that came with getting no response. It was about 5:30ish when I finally got a knock on the door to my house, and before I realized I was on my feet, shoes on and bag at the ready as I swung the door open and–

*BOOM*

A loud bang in my face threw me off, causing me to take a step back as I flailed my arms outward as multi-colored paper covered my body. ""Surprise!"" Came Morgan's voice, his eyes shining with excitement as he handed me a small party popper full of confetti and laughed.”You dick, my ears are ringing again” I grumbled out, though I couldn't be upset for long, instead I smiled and pulled him into a hug before grabbing my keys, and locking the front door behind me as I went down the gravel road towards the sedan that Henry drove.

“Happy birthday, bitch” he called out as his window rolled down, a large smile on his face as his sunglasses reflected the summer sun as I approached and got in the front passenger side, aux cord handed to me, as was tradition for the birthday person, and we took off down the road.


I lived on the edge of the city limits then, in a small trailer that my dad rented from his buddy, so it was a nice seven to nine minutes of tunes and talking about what we were planning for the weekend when Henry turned down the music. “We're gonna have to make a stop at the store to grab a few things, but Casey is gonna meet us there and keep you company” “keep me company? What, am I a child?” I joked, when Morgan nodded his head and jokingly replied “have you met yourself? It's a surprise you haven't been banned from all the stupid stuff you do”.

The store itself was nothing too eventful, so I'll spare it here, the only relevant information to take is that I was kept distracted in the lego section looking for a new set to build with everyone(I settled.on one of the mega construx halo sets) and was told stay inside the store until they got everything packed away. After finally getting back to the car, we all packed into the sedan, music blaring as we drove out of the town towards Henry's house since he lived on some nice farm property, perfect for dicking around in his woods or going to the makeshift range he set up to fire off some guns.

Pulling up to his house, I was immediately escorted inside, moving through the kitchen, the living room and down the hall towards Henry's bedroom, where I was told to stay until everything was set up. Not that I minded, in fact I was elated, the feeling of having a good group of friends that cared enough to plan the day out on your behalf is a feeling that sits nice and warm on the soul. While I waited, scrolling on my phone the bedroom doors opened and I was greeted to the sight of our fifth friend in the group who hadn't been with Casey at the store, Jade.

Jade was an…. interesting friend, with green eyes, shaggy ginger hair and baggy clothes would have thrown anyone off to the idea of him training to be in the Marines. He was the only one in my friend group to not have any belief or interest in the paranormal, always believing in the science of the world and even dismissing religion to a degree.

“Yo, happy birthday man” he greeted, his short stature waltzing into the room and enveloping me with a hug. “Heyo, thanks man” I responded back, watching as he sat next to me on the bed and offered me a cool soda he had produced from his back pocket.

 “You gonna tell me what they got planned out there?” “No way man, I was sworn to secrecy and to keep you here til they're done”. That was fine, I grabbed my overnight bag and pulled out the Xbox I brought with me, hooking it up quickly as the two of us settled on playing some halo together, when the door was pushed open and there in his sleeveless shirt and cargo pants, built like he was already in the military stood Henry. 

What followed was an unsettling amount of silence, followed by him letting out a large belch, extending his arm outward to point at me followed by another “bitch”.

I laughed, scooting over and handing him another controller as we played through the multi-player for a few matches when Henry's phone went off, and he motioned for us to follow. Making our way through the house and onto his front porch, I saw Morgan standing off to the side with something behind his back and Casey as they turned their attention to me and pointed into the entrance of woods that occupied Henry's property.

“We set up something in the woods for ya, but you'll probably need this” Morgan explained, handing me a metal pipe from Henry's scrap pile, to which Casey made a confused face. “Dude, you're making it sound like we're gonna kill him in the woods.” I agreed and laughed, stepping off the porch as they followed behind, and following into the makeshift path as we entered.


The woods of his property were interesting, old decaying rv homes were nested deeper into the property, the woods themselves being about four acres large, along with at least another two acres of tall grass that had been dug into for his makeshift range, and finally, no neighbors for at least 10 miles. All of this to say, as I stepped into the woods it felt off. This wasn't the first time this happened to me, as a matter of fact Henry and I have already had some weird encounters on his property(that's another set of stories for another day). This was similar, like a weight clamped around my ankles as the feeling of being watched had pulled me from my excitement, my eyes narrowing as I scanned between the trees in search of something, when I saw it.

Hanging from a rather tall branch, in a mixture of yellow and green, was a pinata. It swayed slightly, as if it was just hung up and the remaining momentum caused its movement. “Surprise!” They all yelled behind me, and I felt a warmth flow through me as I kept my eyes forward, that tense feeling fading immediately.


The rest of the evening was very fun and entertaining, filled with profanities at each other as we played video games, built the halo set I had acquired, and laughing so hard that I almost threw up when Henry decided to do the hilarious bit that was taking a bite out of the number eight candle from the store bought cake Morgan had gotten me.

The sun had fallen, and darkness had settled over the property when I had a brilliant idea. “Yall wanna play scp?” I had asked innocently enough. Watching the living room we had all settled into as everyone looked up, then to each other, as everyone had lit up with interest. “Are we gonna be using actual BB rounds?” Casey asked, and when I nodded my head in response, his smile grew. Quickly everyone had changed into the spare airsoft gear Henry had, and if you didn't play pretend on the playground with the weird kids (i.e me), lemme give the most brief rundown.

One person dresses up as a “monster/scp”, usually with a mask or whatever Halloween costume you have laying around, while the others dress as a scientist and guards. The game itself is simple. The monster/scp hides and stalks the guards and scientist, trying to “kill” them. Meanwhile the guards and scientist have to “capture” the monster/scp, usually by chasing and grabbing them. The monster wins by killing the guards, and the scientist wins by capturing the monster. 

With the proper context, you could see why a bunch of teens that love scary things would get excited. I went first, donning a plague leather doctor mask as well as a black oversized oversized hoodie to help me blend in with the shadows and went out into the darkness to prepare for my scares as a monster. This went completely wrong as in less than a minute after everyone stepped out, the glass lens of my mask gave me away as a flashlight shined in my direction, and they promptly lit me up until I was on the ground in pain, which in hindsight was very funny.

Next up was Henry, who after requesting we stand in his bedroom, finally said he was ready and we were able to step out. What greeted us was a completely dark household. Quickly we got into formation, with Jade being the scientist for the round, me and Morgan took point in the front as Casey, being the tallest of our group, stayed with Jade in the back as we slowly walked through the home with our flashlights being the only light source. Slowly we cleared each room, checking around corners and occasionally getting tense when we heard a noise like a floorboard creaking, or tapping on glass. Making our way toward the living room we saw the door wide open, the front porch light flickering as Henry had deliberately left it open, the summer chill blowing in as we cautiously approached. 

Despite the layered clothing, a breeze had picked up, the chills immediately piercing through my clothing and causing me to adjust my helmet as I let out a shudder. “he could be anywhere. Look around but don't go too far” Jade's voice had cut through the silence, and with a bit more confidence me and Morgan stepped off the porch and onto the gravel driveway, with Jade and Casey following behind us.

Having nothing but the muffled sound of feet pressing against gravel, combined with the gentle yet persistent summer breeze in the darkness of a cloudly full moon night could put anyone on edge, which made the game all the more exciting. We kept moving, my weapon trained on the dark forest path as the helmet mounted flashlight barely illuminated my surroundings, when I heard a scream echo into the night, followed by an airsoft gun firing as Casey yelled “contact! He's in the trees!”. Quickly I looked up, and jumping from one tree to another was Henry, dressed in a purple morphsuit adorned with a hairy zombie mask.

“F-FUCK!” “What the hell!” me and Morgan shouted over each other, firing into the tops of the trees as branches cracked and rustled, the blur of grey and purple mixing with the foliage as he took off.

“Nope, nope I'm not doing this!” Casey had called out, and I turned to see he had somehow fallen onto his back, and was currently being helped up. “Pussy!” Henry's voice called from the darkness, and after a beat of silence Casey let out a huff and walked back inside. That caused us all to laugh, the game paused as Henry came out of the darkness with his mask off and surrendered, claiming he only wanted to scare us. 

Going back inside we turned the lights on and Casey got dressed, choosing to stay out of the game for the rest of the night and sitting on the couch as he claimed a headacheis what made him stop. Which leads us to what happened that night, that to this day, still calls to me. 

It was Jade's turn, and instead of getting a monster costume he chose to keep his layers on, with the addition of one of those World War Two latex gas masks, with large glass eye holes and a long tube. He took Morgan into another room to talk about something as me.and Henry agreed that given the time, this would be our last game for the night. When everyone was ready, Jade stepped out the door and we gave him three minutes to set up, before stepping foot outside into the darkness.

At the time I chalked it up to Henry's previous turn as the monster giving me a tense feeling, but it felt off out there, like it had during my previous experiences in the past. Making our way into the woods, we saw that the makeshift trail had been disturbed, indicating that Jade went that way. Slowly, I took the lead as Henry and Morgan had stayed behind, making our way through as the light from my flashlight caught something reflecting in the distance, one of the old decaying RVs. I motioned for them to follow, making my way to the RV as I quickly threw my gun up onto the roof, and scrambled to get on top of it.

“Corey, what are you doing?” Morgan hissed from the darkness, meanwhile I pulled myself up and grabbed my gun, looking around as i quickly scanned our dark surroundings. The RV was placed in a small tall grass patch between the trees, with the path cutting through it before going back into the treeline about twelve feet away.


“Leverage, this is the only clear patch before going deeper and I'm willing to bet he's out here somewhere” i with certainly, and as Henry finally caught up to us, I heard the sound of bushes rustling and immediately pointed my gun, watching the treeline ahead of us for a few minutes when the sound of a thud, followed by Morgan taking off into the darkness pulled my attention. “Morgan? Where did you go!” I called out, looking to the ground and not seeing Henry initially, I assumed that they left. And just as I was about to get down, I heard more rustling, followed by a figure stepping into the treeline.

“Jade?” I called out, the visor of my helmet conveniently fogging up and causing me to take it off. I set it to the side, letting the flashlight illuminate the direction i was looking in as I focused onto the person, watching as the light caught onto the glass lenses as the clouds had cleared up enough to let the full moon shine, further illuminating his figure and confirming it was Jade. 

I took aim, ready to hit I'm in the arms and call it game, when I felt an wave of melancholy wash over me. Quickly pulling my phone out of the jacket pocket, I checked the time, seeing it had now been 1 in the morning. Call it selfish, but I knew this was the last game of the night, and I wanted to make it last longer. “You know, I didn't think you could be scary in that, but I'm impressed” I joked, trying to get a reaction out of him. Only to be met with silence.

I tried speaking again, recounting the night's and inside jokes our group had, only to be met with his glass lenses reflecting back to me. I then decided to stay quiet, listening as I could hear the rather loud breathing coming from him. “If you're having a hard time breathing in that, you can take it off” I offered, watching as his only reaction was to squat down and take a step forward.

The gun fired before I even acknowledged it, watching as the pellet crashed into the dirt and exploded, a few bits hitting his shoe as both it and the latex mask shined slightly against the combination of moonlight and the helmet light. “No, fuck that. It's been fun but I really need you to respond jade” I called out, my voice wobbling as I turned on my phones flash to give me a better view of my friend, and desperately trying to ignore the sinking feeling in my stomach.

Jade just stood there as the light was.cast onto him, his breathing the only sound as he inched closer and I fired another shot st his feet, this time deliberate. “STOP FUCKING WITH ME JADE” I yelled, a swirl of anger and fear clawing at my mind as I aimed to shoot him in at the base of the mask's tube. I know I know, it's not something you should do, but i was scared.

As we stared each other down, the loud muffled breathing being the only noise in the woods around us, another noise pulled our attention, the sound of someone running. While he was still squatting, I watched as Jade darted deeper into the woods in just two strides, and I used the opportunity to getting off the RV's roof as I saw it was Morgan, having ran back and with a smile on his face as I began to speak. “Morgan! I-I saw Jade! He dashed into the trees and-” I was stopped as I felt something poke my chest. Looking down I saw a plastic knife poking me as Morgan spoke. “Surprise! It was a betrayal!” He giggled, and I let out a sigh as I heard noise come from the rv, which was Henry, having been pretending to be dead on the ground and dusted himself off.

“That, was bullshit, by the way.” He huffed out, and after we shared a laugh, grabbed our gear and called out for Jade, claiming him and Morgan won the game and it was time to go back in for the night. Instead of responding, what happened was the three of us spending the next twenty minutes walking around in the woods looking for him, before finally giving up and heading back to the house.



As we entered back into the house, we were greeted to the sight of Jade and Casey, the former of which was already dressed down into his pajamas as he sat at the kitchen table eating some nuggets and the latter was already laying on the couch. “Damn man, you really gave me a scare out there” I complimented as I sat down across from him, watching as Henry and Morgan passed through the house to get dressed for the night.


“I didn't go out.” 


It was said so casually, like he was commenting on how a rock looked or offering what to eat. “That's funny, but seriously it was really scary” I tried to compliment, an odd feeling of irritation forming at his dismissal. “I didn't go out there man” he said again, his eyes meeting mine as he held a neutral expression. 

“Jade-” I started calmly, watching him as I felt my irritation grow irrationally. “I'm trying to say you did good, and I know you were out there, I saw the gas mask”. His facial features hardened, very clearly not liking my tone. “I. Wasn't. Out. There.” I stood up abruptly, ready to argue and yell when Casey's voice spoke up. “dude, he came in like, two minutes after you guys went out. He even made me food.” 

And just like that, every off feeling and sensation from earlier came crashing into me. “What?” I asked, looking to Casey asn Morgan and Henry entered into the room. 

“Dude, I saw and heard you under the rv” Henry claimed, our eyes meeting as we shared a look of worry. “Guys, I didn't go out.” He responded, his tone becoming desperate, looking to the three of us as a desperate demand for belief echoed in his features.

In a swift motion, I turned to lock the front door, peeking out the windows as Henry ran back to his room and Morgan moved to comfort Jade, who had now leaned onto the kitchen table and began to break down. “Fuck, was something out there, like actually?” Casey had asked, watching as Henry had reappeared holding an actual gun, procured from the safe in his room. “We don't know. Let's just stay inside and buddy up for the night, okay?” He responded, looking at me with a stoic expression he wore often when we experienced something paranormal.

His closest neighbor was, like I said, ten miles away, so even if it wasn't something spooky, then it was another person who just happened to wear the same gear Jade had on when he went outside, which one could argue was scarier. Either way, what happened next was actually pretty anticlimactic. The following morning, after we all collectively slept in Henry's small bedroom me, Jade and Henry went out onto the pathway to try and recreate what we saw, as well as check the dirt for potential boot prints, of which there were none.


That was one of last big experiences we had that summer, what we refered to as the “Jadewalker Incident”. I'm twenty-three now, I've fallen out with Casey and Morgan, and me, Henry and Jade have all moved out of state, but lately some more… weird things have happened to me, and I've been feeling that calling once again.


I might share more one day, If this calling gets worse. In the meantime, stop looking for cryptids, monsters and the Paranormal, it's an addiction worse than smoking, and if you get real unlucky, one day, you may just find what you're looking for.

1mf7v4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CongratsLikeImFive/comments/1mf7v4l/i_got_my_first_blood_work_done_this_morning/,I got my first blood work done this morning,"I’m extremely afraid of getting my blood drawn and have a needle inserted into my veins from the crook of my elbow, it’s all so disgusting and horrible sounding to me and I get paralyzed with fear whenever I think about that happening to me. I work myself up into panic attacks sometimes just thinking about myself going through the process. But I had to get it done today for something important. 

I took 2mg of Ativan a hour beforehand so I was a bit calmer as I don’t think I could’ve ever done this sober. I was nervous but alright until the nurse came in and began the process of tying my arm and tapping to find the vein. I had my music blasting in my ear and was feeling a little confused and loopy from the Ativan, which helped a bit but I was still so scared. I got stabbed first but they couldn’t properly get into the vein so they had to take it out and try on my other arm. Once I felt the first needle in my arm I started crying and breathing fast and shut my eyes. They brought in a second nurse who was able to find my vein on my other arm and she successfully got the needle in my vein this time so she could draw blood. Throughout the time the needle was in and blood was going into the vial, I was fully panicked and not having a good time. I was actually sobbing during this time and was clenching every muscle in my body and was kicking my leg against the bottom of the chair and clinging to the other arm of the chair that wasn’t having blood drawn form anymore. It felt like torture because I could feel my vein tighten and pulse as blood ran through it and I could feel the metal bit of needle in the crook of my arm the entire time it was awful I just wanted it to be over and I was desperately stimming and clinging to putting attention on my music. It was over after a minute or two, the nurse removed the needle and put gauze and tape over the wound for me. I was confused after when I had to get out of the chair since the Ativan made me feel a little confused in general and my eyes were shut tight during most of this process so my mom had to come and help me walk out of the room and clinic. She drove me there and back home because I was on the Ativan and incredibly anxious so I basically cried and hyperventilated the whole car ride home. I felt more okay when I got home, but talking was really hard for me to do for about an hour afterwards. My mom was really nice and hugged me and made me coffee and breakfast to eat while I de-stressed.

I’m glad that I physically got through the process, and I’m going to chug a lot of water and do push-ups beforehand so they can find my veins easier next time. I don’t feel like o got over my fear of anything, I still feel panic and dread thinking about doing this process again, but hopefully I learn more tips and can deal with it better. 

I’m mostly just posting to say that I did something that was really difficult for me today but went through with it, didn’t chicken out even when it was hard and I could have, and came out alive. 

Also thank you to anyone who bothered to read all of this haha, I’m very grateful and I appreciate you, stranger. ",14,1754081377.0,CongratsLikeImFive,1,0.94,False

1mf7uce,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mf7uce/stop_looking_for_the_paranormal/,Stop Looking For The Paranormal.,"Hello, I don't know how to properly explain this, but I have an addiction. I know how that sounds, but what I say is different from what most people say when they have an addiction though, they'll usually go to a program or get help, or just say screw it and continue to spiral into their vices. I fall somewhere in between. My addiction runs deep, since I was a kid with a neglectful/workaholic parent and too much free time on the internet in the early 2000's. Before I continue my name is Corey, and my path of cryptids and things that went bump in the night started with unrestricted internet access in about 2010 with two very important pieces of media, one being a thick book hidden away in my elementary school library called ""Weird Ohio”, and when I came across a video series called Marble Hornets. 

To make a long story short of it, I was hooked. I watched every video from the series, listened to every creepypasta I could get my hands on, read up on scps  and even convinced my blue collar father to buy me one of those at the time seventy dollar handheld cam-recorders so I could make videos in my neighborhood. All of this is to help you get an understanding of where I'm coming from and how these communities I interacted with helped to shape me as I grew up.

Growing up in Ohio as a “creepypasta kid”, it was surprising just how little I was bullied for it back in the day, but that could be chalked up to either my downplaying it and masking my “weirder” interests with things like halo and left 4 dead, or that the town I grew up in was pretty weird already(p.s, if you're ever in Ohio and find yourself in Tuscarawas County, go visit the warlocks grave). But for all my oddities and interests, it led me to a small encounter when I was eleven years old. 

It started innocent enough, I was on my winter break and as a 5th grader with too much social media influence and no supervision, I did what I assumed almost no one else my age was doing and grabbed an oversized hoodie, a nerf blaster, and my camera before making my way out the door and into the snow covered neighborhood to “hunt for creepypastas”. I should clarify it right now, I was a child. Barely double digits and as much as I cringe to myself as I write this I want to effectively explain why little moments like these have led to some of the decisions I made years later down the line. Around my house was a river with trees that I used as a makeshift hideout during nerf battles with my friends, and a road that went up a wooded hill into a hiking trail that everyone in my neighborhood believed to be home to several scary characters, like the Seed Eater and Slenderman himself.

With my camera in hand and an empty nerf gun, I first trekked through the hard snow towards the river, making sure the Rake or another scary entity hadn't snuck in to steal any of my rotting wooden chairs or secret stash of darts, not really considering they would have no use for either of those things. Walking back towards my house and patrolling the streets I found myself standing at the base of the hill, staring up into the snow covered trees that seemed so intimidating at my young age, I flipped open the screen to my camera and started to record myself going up the hill.


Now, despite this being my “first” encounter with something I couldn't really explain, I haven't the clearest memory of how I got so lost and turned around up there, only that I remember being on my knees in the snow as I desperately tried to wipe snot off my face as I cried. That's when I saw them, though. In-between the tears and fear of being lost I can remember looking up and just about twenty to thirty feet down the hill stood three individuals.

They were blurry, I remember that, but that could have been because of the tears that clouded my vision. I can also remember that despite the distance between me and them, their voices called out in a whisper. Do you ever remember the feeling of having a parent talk softly as you want to sleep? It was like that. Their voices were soft and comforting, and by the time I had stopped crying I had found myself at the start of the trail, my face wiped of snot and tears, and my camera in my hand. I can remember going back home and not even realizing I was out for most of the day, opening the screen door and greeted with the angered voice of my father saying it was dinnertime, and that he had looked for me everywhere in the neighborhood. I was too scared to tell him what happened, so I remember lying and saying I was at “the new kids house”.

I don't remember what became of that camera, as I've moved to 3 different states since then. Looking back on it now, it seemed more likely it was a case of “Third Man Syndrome”, if you're unfamiliar with it, it's when missing people or people in situations like a car wreck report a voice or person guiding and helping them to safety. Though whether that was the case or not, it was my first taste of something unusual happening to me.

All of that is to say, despite the small experiences I had growing up, I know for sure that what happened around my eighteenth birthday was supernatural in nature.

To help set the scene, it was early June in 2020 and I was living in a small town in Southern Colorado, which as a then freshly graduated high-schooler the world pandemic put a bit of a hold on things like college. What didn't get put on hold though was the military, which is where I introduce you to my friends Morgan, Jade, Casey and Henry. Morgan, Henry and Jade were enlisting into the Marines, while Casey was going into the navy, which was kinda ironic given that I was 6 '1, and he had a good three inches on me, though with how lanky he was and the way he kept his blond hair short, he fit right in.

Another small note to add, with all of our shared interests, each of us had had some sort of experience with the paranormal.

Ever since the start of my senior year, me and my friends had formed a pretty tight bond, so much so that we would spend the weekends at Henry's, with Saturday for PT(Physical Training), coffee from a small plant shop, and then gaming or whatever shenanigans that lasted until Sunday evening when we all went home. The reason I explain this is that one Saturday Casey finally found out his ship date, and it was before my 18th birthday. Now, being the youngest of my friend group by only a few months meant I was the “kid” of the group, despite the fact that Henry's birthday was two months ago. Casey, being the big macho man he had been puffing himself up to be, decided that we should celebrate before he heads out, and as such made a plan for the weekend of the 12th as the time to celebrate.

When the day arrived, I remember being in my room watching as the clock on my phone ticked the minutes by, my futon groaning as the cheap and slightly broken metal frame held me up as i had eagerly awaited a message back from my friends, trying my hardest not to dwell on the self-conscious feelings of being ignored that came with getting no response. It was about 5:30ish when I finally got a knock on the door to my house, and before I realized I was on my feet, shoes on and bag at the ready as I swung the door open and–

*BOOM*

A loud bang in my face threw me off, causing me to take a step back as I flailed my arms outward as multi-colored paper covered my body. ""Surprise!"" Came Morgan's voice, his eyes shining with excitement as he handed me a small party popper full of confetti and laughed.”You dick, my ears are ringing again” I grumbled out, though I couldn't be upset for long, instead I smiled and pulled him into a hug before grabbing my keys, and locking the front door behind me as I went down the gravel road towards the sedan that Henry drove.

“Happy birthday, bitch” he called out as his window rolled down, a large smile on his face as his sunglasses reflected the summer sun as I approached and got in the front passenger side, aux cord handed to me, as was tradition for the birthday person, and we took off down the road.


I lived on the edge of the city limits then, in a small trailer that my dad rented from his buddy, so it was a nice seven to nine minutes of tunes and talking about what we were planning for the weekend when Henry turned down the music. “We're gonna have to make a stop at the store to grab a few things, but Casey is gonna meet us there and keep you company” “keep me company? What, am I a child?” I joked, when Morgan nodded his head and jokingly replied “have you met yourself? It's a surprise you haven't been banned from all the stupid stuff you do”.

The store itself was nothing too eventful, so I'll spare it here, the only relevant information to take is that I was kept distracted in the lego section looking for a new set to build with everyone(I settled.on one of the mega construx halo sets) and was told stay inside the store until they got everything packed away. After finally getting back to the car, we all packed into the sedan, music blaring as we drove out of the town towards Henry's house since he lived on some nice farm property, perfect for dicking around in his woods or going to the makeshift range he set up to fire off some guns.

Pulling up to his house, I was immediately escorted inside, moving through the kitchen, the living room and down the hall towards Henry's bedroom, where I was told to stay until everything was set up. Not that I minded, in fact I was elated, the feeling of having a good group of friends that cared enough to plan the day out on your behalf is a feeling that sits nice and warm on the soul. While I waited, scrolling on my phone the bedroom doors opened and I was greeted to the sight of our fifth friend in the group who hadn't been with Casey at the store, Jade.

Jade was an…. interesting friend, with green eyes, shaggy ginger hair and baggy clothes would have thrown anyone off to the idea of him training to be in the Marines. He was the only one in my friend group to not have any belief or interest in the paranormal, always believing in the science of the world and even dismissing religion to a degree.

“Yo, happy birthday man” he greeted, his short stature waltzing into the room and enveloping me with a hug. “Heyo, thanks man” I responded back, watching as he sat next to me on the bed and offered me a cool soda he had produced from his back pocket.

 “You gonna tell me what they got planned out there?” “No way man, I was sworn to secrecy and to keep you here til they're done”. That was fine, I grabbed my overnight bag and pulled out the Xbox I brought with me, hooking it up quickly as the two of us settled on playing some halo together, when the door was pushed open and there in his sleeveless shirt and cargo pants, built like he was already in the military stood Henry. 

What followed was an unsettling amount of silence, followed by him letting out a large belch, extending his arm outward to point at me followed by another “bitch”.

I laughed, scooting over and handing him another controller as we played through the multi-player for a few matches when Henry's phone went off, and he motioned for us to follow. Making our way through the house and onto his front porch, I saw Morgan standing off to the side with something behind his back and Casey as they turned their attention to me and pointed into the entrance of woods that occupied Henry's property.

“We set up something in the woods for ya, but you'll probably need this” Morgan explained, handing me a metal pipe from Henry's scrap pile, to which Casey made a confused face. “Dude, you're making it sound like we're gonna kill him in the woods.” I agreed and laughed, stepping off the porch as they followed behind, and following into the makeshift path as we entered.


The woods of his property were interesting, old decaying rv homes were nested deeper into the property, the woods themselves being about four acres large, along with at least another two acres of tall grass that had been dug into for his makeshift range, and finally, no neighbors for at least 10 miles. All of this to say, as I stepped into the woods it felt off. This wasn't the first time this happened to me, as a matter of fact Henry and I have already had some weird encounters on his property(that's another set of stories for another day). This was similar, like a weight clamped around my ankles as the feeling of being watched had pulled me from my excitement, my eyes narrowing as I scanned between the trees in search of something, when I saw it.

Hanging from a rather tall branch, in a mixture of yellow and green, was a pinata. It swayed slightly, as if it was just hung up and the remaining momentum caused its movement. “Surprise!” They all yelled behind me, and I felt a warmth flow through me as I kept my eyes forward, that tense feeling fading immediately.


The rest of the evening was very fun and entertaining, filled with profanities at each other as we played video games, built the halo set I had acquired, and laughing so hard that I almost threw up when Henry decided to do the hilarious bit that was taking a bite out of the number eight candle from the store bought cake Morgan had gotten me.

The sun had fallen, and darkness had settled over the property when I had a brilliant idea. “Yall wanna play scp?” I had asked innocently enough. Watching the living room we had all settled into as everyone looked up, then to each other, as everyone had lit up with interest. “Are we gonna be using actual BB rounds?” Casey asked, and when I nodded my head in response, his smile grew. Quickly everyone had changed into the spare airsoft gear Henry had, and if you didn't play pretend on the playground with the weird kids (i.e me), lemme give the most brief rundown.

One person dresses up as a “monster/scp”, usually with a mask or whatever Halloween costume you have laying around, while the others dress as a scientist and guards. The game itself is simple. The monster/scp hides and stalks the guards and scientist, trying to “kill” them. Meanwhile the guards and scientist have to “capture” the monster/scp, usually by chasing and grabbing them. The monster wins by killing the guards, and the scientist wins by capturing the monster. 

With the proper context, you could see why a bunch of teens that love scary things would get excited. I went first, donning a plague leather doctor mask as well as a black oversized oversized hoodie to help me blend in with the shadows and went out into the darkness to prepare for my scares as a monster. This went completely wrong as in less than a minute after everyone stepped out, the glass lens of my mask gave me away as a flashlight shined in my direction, and they promptly lit me up until I was on the ground in pain, which in hindsight was very funny.

Next up was Henry, who after requesting we stand in his bedroom, finally said he was ready and we were able to step out. What greeted us was a completely dark household. Quickly we got into formation, with Jade being the scientist for the round, me and Morgan took point in the front as Casey, being the tallest of our group, stayed with Jade in the back as we slowly walked through the home with our flashlights being the only light source. Slowly we cleared each room, checking around corners and occasionally getting tense when we heard a noise like a floorboard creaking, or tapping on glass. Making our way toward the living room we saw the door wide open, the front porch light flickering as Henry had deliberately left it open, the summer chill blowing in as we cautiously approached. 

Despite the layered clothing, a breeze had picked up, the chills immediately piercing through my clothing and causing me to adjust my helmet as I let out a shudder. “he could be anywhere. Look around but don't go too far” Jade's voice had cut through the silence, and with a bit more confidence me and Morgan stepped off the porch and onto the gravel driveway, with Jade and Casey following behind us.

Having nothing but the muffled sound of feet pressing against gravel, combined with the gentle yet persistent summer breeze in the darkness of a cloudly full moon night could put anyone on edge, which made the game all the more exciting. We kept moving, my weapon trained on the dark forest path as the helmet mounted flashlight barely illuminated my surroundings, when I heard a scream echo into the night, followed by an airsoft gun firing as Casey yelled “contact! He's in the trees!”. Quickly I looked up, and jumping from one tree to another was Henry, dressed in a purple morphsuit adorned with a hairy zombie mask.

“F-FUCK!” “What the hell!” me and Morgan shouted over each other, firing into the tops of the trees as branches cracked and rustled, the blur of grey and purple mixing with the foliage as he took off.

“Nope, nope I'm not doing this!” Casey had called out, and I turned to see he had somehow fallen onto his back, and was currently being helped up. “Pussy!” Henry's voice called from the darkness, and after a beat of silence Casey let out a huff and walked back inside. That caused us all to laugh, the game paused as Henry came out of the darkness with his mask off and surrendered, claiming he only wanted to scare us. 

Going back inside we turned the lights on and Casey got dressed, choosing to stay out of the game for the rest of the night and sitting on the couch as he claimed a headacheis what made him stop. Which leads us to what happened that night, that to this day, still calls to me. 

It was Jade's turn, and instead of getting a monster costume he chose to keep his layers on, with the addition of one of those World War Two latex gas masks, with large glass eye holes and a long tube. He took Morgan into another room to talk about something as me.and Henry agreed that given the time, this would be our last game for the night. When everyone was ready, Jade stepped out the door and we gave him three minutes to set up, before stepping foot outside into the darkness.

At the time I chalked it up to Henry's previous turn as the monster giving me a tense feeling, but it felt off out there, like it had during my previous experiences in the past. Making our way into the woods, we saw that the makeshift trail had been disturbed, indicating that Jade went that way. Slowly, I took the lead as Henry and Morgan had stayed behind, making our way through as the light from my flashlight caught something reflecting in the distance, one of the old decaying RVs. I motioned for them to follow, making my way to the RV as I quickly threw my gun up onto the roof, and scrambled to get on top of it.

“Corey, what are you doing?” Morgan hissed from the darkness, meanwhile I pulled myself up and grabbed my gun, looking around as i quickly scanned our dark surroundings. The RV was placed in a small tall grass patch between the trees, with the path cutting through it before going back into the treeline about twelve feet away.


“Leverage, this is the only clear patch before going deeper and I'm willing to bet he's out here somewhere” i with certainly, and as Henry finally caught up to us, I heard the sound of bushes rustling and immediately pointed my gun, watching the treeline ahead of us for a few minutes when the sound of a thud, followed by Morgan taking off into the darkness pulled my attention. “Morgan? Where did you go!” I called out, looking to the ground and not seeing Henry initially, I assumed that they left. And just as I was about to get down, I heard more rustling, followed by a figure stepping into the treeline.

“Jade?” I called out, the visor of my helmet conveniently fogging up and causing me to take it off. I set it to the side, letting the flashlight illuminate the direction i was looking in as I focused onto the person, watching as the light caught onto the glass lenses as the clouds had cleared up enough to let the full moon shine, further illuminating his figure and confirming it was Jade. 

I took aim, ready to hit I'm in the arms and call it game, when I felt an wave of melancholy wash over me. Quickly pulling my phone out of the jacket pocket, I checked the time, seeing it had now been 1 in the morning. Call it selfish, but I knew this was the last game of the night, and I wanted to make it last longer. “You know, I didn't think you could be scary in that, but I'm impressed” I joked, trying to get a reaction out of him. Only to be met with silence.

I tried speaking again, recounting the night's and inside jokes our group had, only to be met with his glass lenses reflecting back to me. I then decided to stay quiet, listening as I could hear the rather loud breathing coming from him. “If you're having a hard time breathing in that, you can take it off” I offered, watching as his only reaction was to squat down and take a step forward.

The gun fired before I even acknowledged it, watching as the pellet crashed into the dirt and exploded, a few bits hitting his shoe as both it and the latex mask shined slightly against the combination of moonlight and the helmet light. “No, fuck that. It's been fun but I really need you to respond jade” I called out, my voice wobbling as I turned on my phones flash to give me a better view of my friend, and desperately trying to ignore the sinking feeling in my stomach.

Jade just stood there as the light was.cast onto him, his breathing the only sound as he inched closer and I fired another shot st his feet, this time deliberate. “STOP FUCKING WITH ME JADE” I yelled, a swirl of anger and fear clawing at my mind as I aimed to shoot him in at the base of the mask's tube. I know I know, it's not something you should do, but i was scared.

As we stared each other down, the loud muffled breathing being the only noise in the woods around us, another noise pulled our attention, the sound of someone running. While he was still squatting, I watched as Jade darted deeper into the woods in just two strides, and I used the opportunity to getting off the RV's roof as I saw it was Morgan, having ran back and with a smile on his face as I began to speak. “Morgan! I-I saw Jade! He dashed into the trees and-” I was stopped as I felt something poke my chest. Looking down I saw a plastic knife poking me as Morgan spoke. “Surprise! It was a betrayal!” He giggled, and I let out a sigh as I heard noise come from the rv, which was Henry, having been pretending to be dead on the ground and dusted himself off.

“That, was bullshit, by the way.” He huffed out, and after we shared a laugh, grabbed our gear and called out for Jade, claiming him and Morgan won the game and it was time to go back in for the night. Instead of responding, what happened was the three of us spending the next twenty minutes walking around in the woods looking for him, before finally giving up and heading back to the house.



As we entered back into the house, we were greeted to the sight of Jade and Casey, the former of which was already dressed down into his pajamas as he sat at the kitchen table eating some nuggets and the latter was already laying on the couch. “Damn man, you really gave me a scare out there” I complimented as I sat down across from him, watching as Henry and Morgan passed through the house to get dressed for the night.


“I didn't go out.” 


It was said so casually, like he was commenting on how a rock looked or offering what to eat. “That's funny, but seriously it was really scary” I tried to compliment, an odd feeling of irritation forming at his dismissal. “I didn't go out there man” he said again, his eyes meeting mine as he held a neutral expression. 

“Jade-” I started calmly, watching him as I felt my irritation grow irrationally. “I'm trying to say you did good, and I know you were out there, I saw the gas mask”. His facial features hardened, very clearly not liking my tone. “I. Wasn't. Out. There.” I stood up abruptly, ready to argue and yell when Casey's voice spoke up. “dude, he came in like, two minutes after you guys went out. He even made me food.” 

And just like that, every off feeling and sensation from earlier came crashing into me. “What?” I asked, looking to Casey asn Morgan and Henry entered into the room. 

“Dude, I saw and heard you under the rv” Henry claimed, our eyes meeting as we shared a look of worry. “Guys, I didn't go out.” He responded, his tone becoming desperate, looking to the three of us as a desperate demand for belief echoed in his features.

In a swift motion, I turned to lock the front door, peeking out the windows as Henry ran back to his room and Morgan moved to comfort Jade, who had now leaned onto the kitchen table and began to break down. “Fuck, was something out there, like actually?” Casey had asked, watching as Henry had reappeared holding an actual gun, procured from the safe in his room. “We don't know. Let's just stay inside and buddy up for the night, okay?” He responded, looking at me with a stoic expression he wore often when we experienced something paranormal.

His closest neighbor was, like I said, ten miles away, so even if it wasn't something spooky, then it was another person who just happened to wear the same gear Jade had on when he went outside, which one could argue was scarier. Either way, what happened next was actually pretty anticlimactic. The following morning, after we all collectively slept in Henry's small bedroom me, Jade and Henry went out onto the pathway to try and recreate what we saw, as well as check the dirt for potential boot prints, of which there were none.


That was one of last big experiences we had that summer, what we refered to as the “Jadewalker Incident”. I'm twenty-three now, I've fallen out with Casey and Morgan, and me, Henry and Jade have all moved out of state, but lately some more… weird things have happened to me, and I've been feeling that calling once again.


I might share more one day, If this calling gets worse. In the meantime, stop looking for cryptids, monsters and the Paranormal, it's an addiction worse than smoking, and if you get real unlucky, one day, you may just find what you're looking for.

1mf7tgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GentlemanFragrance/comments/1mf7tgp/what_are_your_top_masculine_fragrances/,What Are Your Top Masculine Fragrances?,"Hi Gentlemen,

I've been thinking about my own collection lately and what truly defines a sophisticated, masculine scent as we get a bit older and refine our personal style. It's about finding fragrances that convey a sense of confidence, composure, and the desired presence in any given situation.

For me, my absolute signature scent, the one that really captures that essence, is **Parfums de Marly Herod (Batch 411401)**. That tobacco and vanilla blend just exudes a calm, assured vibe. Beyond Herod, some of my other top contenders for a refined fragrance wardrobe include:

* **Roja Dove Fetish Pour Homme**: A bold, sharp leather that's undeniably impactful.
* **Mugler Pure Havane**: A richer, sweeter tobacco that still maintains a polished edge.
* **Shihan (Sensei) by Piotr Czarnecki**: A fantastic hidden gem that offers a unique whiskey, coffee and tobacco elegance.
* **Tom Ford Tobacco Oud Intense**: Deep, resinous, and incredibly potent for cooler weather.

These are the scents I reach for when I want to feel put-together and confident, whether it's for a special occasion or just a regular day when I want to feel my best.

Now, I'm genuinely curious to hear from other mature men in this community. What are your go-to masculine fragrances that truly resonate with your personal style? 

I'm eager to discover what classic colognes, sophisticated men's scents, or unique niche perfumes you rely on to exude confidence and refinement. Share your top picks and why they work for you!

Looking forward to some excellent discussions and new discoveries.

I'm not going to try my luck. 

I appreciated the insight from last time! I rewrote the query focusing on one POV character and trying to improve the readability of it. 

Dear \[Agent\],

I am submitting SKY OF GOLD, LAND OF SALT to you because \[personalization\].

Lilavati Vidali is a sankara, a draconic shapeshifter. She was created and raised to serve as a deadly weapon, though for years she’s longed to create rather than to destroy. Then the war against Frindria left her tortured and imprisoned during a genocide against the sankara. Ashamed of surviving when her sisters didn’t, Lila vows to ensure those responsible for the war are punished. When that alone doesn’t satisfy her desire for justice, she decides on a new target: the genocidal ideology that caused the attempted slaughter of her people. 

All her strength is useless when fighting beliefs rather than armies. It requires changing Frindria’s society at its core. Her reputation as a well-respected war hero secures her a position in the post-war administration. Lila partners with Frindrian survivors to build a new government, while dealing with the scars left by the old one. But Frindria is on the verge of starvation, and has been since before the war. Frindria’s yadukari majority still believe sankara, Lila’s species, caused the famine—and are gearing up to resume their violence. 

Tensions within Frindria worsen as food resources dwindle, and Lila’s government begins to question if their investment in Frindria is worth it. Preventing the next war means not only removing the fascist rot woven throughout Frindria’s institutions but also solving the environmental crisis that served as justification for the genocide. Lila must navigate a web of conflicting political interests to create a new future, before it’s too late to prevent a repeat of the past.

Complete at 98,000 words, SKY OF GOLD, LAND OF SALT is a multi-pov, adult fantasy novel about transitional justice after a brutal conflict. It mixes the exploration of identity and the power of history in *Raybearer* by Jordan Ifueko with the political intrigue of *The Raven Scholar* by Antonia Hodgson.

I am a graduate student studying identity, conflict, and genocide. My work focuses on transitional justice, which is vital to Lila’s journey of struggling between desiring punitive or restorative justice. I live with my wife and my mother, who immigrated to the US from Guyana as an adult. I’ve brought my experience as a mixed race woman living in the US, as well as my mother’s stories of growing up and immigrating, into Lila’s struggle of how to love a country that doesn’t always love you back. I have published previously in academic and other non-fiction spaces.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,

First 300 

It was a sign of respect to burn bodies back in Kalendra. The freezing snow and constant wind made maintaining an outdoor fire difficult. Frindria was lush. Fires burned without interference. Dark green vegetation surrounded Lila, as if it was offering itself up as kindling as payment for the corpses fertilizing Frindria’s ruined soil. The country could burn, and it would only take a spark. It could be razed to the ground, and maybe the world would be better for it. 

The thought was cruel. The war had been crueler.

Lila tilted her head back, letting the dying rays of the sun hit her face. She’d taken a seat outside to escape the suspicious gaze of the barista inside the coffee shop. The square, darker spots on the chipped paint indicated where signs had once hung saying sankara like her were banned from entering. That was illegal now. But the barista wasn’t shielding her thoughts, and the vitriol that filled her mind made it clear she wished the old ways would return.

The old ways were the reason why Lila had spent the day thinking of funerals. Two months after the end of the war the old ways had caused, they had finally found her sister’s body. If the barista had her way, every sankara would be burned. The old government had certainly tried.

For a moment she pulled her magic back, silencing the minds around her. But the silence in her mind was terrifying. Knowledge would keep her safe, knowledge would let her know where the threats were. It had been a mistake to come here alone, but she couldn’t go back now. She released her magic again and her mind was full of others’ thoughts once more.",3,1754081203.0,PubTips,3,0.81,False

# Commercial: Top Choices & 2025 Buying Guide - Saddle Style Barstools with Backs

Saddle style barstools with backs offer a blend of comfort, style, and durability, making them a popular choice for commercial settings such as restaurants, bars, and cafes. These stools provide ergonomic support thanks to their contoured seats and added backrests, encouraging patrons to linger longer and enhancing the overall customer experience. This buying guide explores the top choices in saddle style barstools with backs, highlighting key features, benefits, and considerations to help businesses make informed purchasing decisions in 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a suitable saddle style barstool with a back for commercial use hinges on several crucial features that directly impact its functionality, durability, and aesthetic appeal.

**Frame Material and Construction:** The frame material is paramount for withstanding the rigors of commercial use. Options typically include steel, wood, and aluminum. Steel frames, particularly those made of heavy-gauge steel, offer superior strength and stability, making them ideal for high-traffic environments. Wood frames provide a warmer, more traditional aesthetic but require proper sealing and finishing to prevent moisture damage and wear. Aluminum frames are lightweight and rust-resistant, suitable for outdoor or humid environments. The construction method, such as welding or bolting, also contributes to the overall sturdiness of the stool.

**Seat Material and Comfort:** The seat material significantly influences the comfort and longevity of the barstool. Common choices include vinyl, leather, fabric, and wood. Vinyl is a cost-effective and easy-to-clean option, making it suitable for busy restaurants. Leather offers a luxurious feel and is durable but requires more maintenance. Fabric seats provide a wider range of design options but may be more susceptible to stains. Wood seats offer a classic look and are durable but may require cushions for added comfort. The seat should be adequately padded with high-density foam to provide optimal support during extended periods of sitting.

**Backrest Design and Support:** The backrest is a critical feature for providing ergonomic support and enhancing comfort. Backrests can vary in height, shape, and material. A curved backrest that conforms to the natural curvature of the spine offers better lumbar support. The backrest material should be durable and easy to clean, matching the seat material for a cohesive look. Some stools feature open back designs for a more modern aesthetic, while others have fully upholstered backrests for maximum comfort. The attachment method of the backrest to the frame should be robust to withstand frequent use.

**Footrest Placement and Durability:** A well-placed footrest is essential for providing additional support and reducing strain on the legs. The footrest should be positioned at an appropriate height to accommodate a wide range of users. Steel footrests are the most durable and can withstand heavy use without bending or breaking. Some stools feature adjustable footrests to accommodate different heights and preferences. The footrest should be securely attached to the frame to prevent loosening or detachment over time.

**Base Type and Stability:** The base type influences the stability and overall look of the barstool. Common base types include four-leg, pedestal, and swivel. Four-leg bases provide excellent stability and are suitable for uneven surfaces. Pedestal bases offer a sleek, modern look but may be less stable than four-leg bases. Swivel bases allow users to easily rotate, enhancing convenience and interaction. The base should be wide enough to prevent tipping and made of a durable material that can withstand constant use.

## Core Benefits

Saddle style barstools with backs offer several key benefits for commercial establishments, contributing to a positive customer experience and operational efficiency.

**Enhanced Customer Comfort:** The contoured saddle seat and supportive backrest promote proper posture and reduce fatigue, allowing patrons to relax and enjoy their time. This enhanced comfort encourages customers to stay longer and order more, ultimately increasing revenue for the establishment. For example, a customer lingering for an extra hour might order another drink or appetizer, contributing to higher sales.

**Improved Ergonomics:** The ergonomic design of saddle style barstools with backs helps prevent back pain and discomfort, particularly for customers who spend extended periods sitting at the bar. This is especially important in establishments that cater to regulars or those with a focus on creating a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere. This contributes to a positive impression and encourages repeat business.

**Increased Aesthetic Appeal:** Saddle style barstools are available in a wide range of designs, materials, and finishes, allowing businesses to select stools that complement their existing décor and enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of the space. A well-chosen barstool can contribute to the overall ambiance and create a more inviting and stylish environment for customers.

**Durability and Longevity:** Commercial-grade saddle style barstools are designed to withstand the rigors of daily use in high-traffic environments. Durable materials and robust construction ensure that the stools can withstand wear and tear, reducing the need for frequent replacements and saving money in the long run. Investing in high-quality stools ensures a longer lifespan and reduces maintenance costs.

## FAQs Section

**What is the ideal seat height for a saddle style barstool with a back?**
The ideal seat height depends on the height of the bar or counter. Generally, a seat height of 29-32 inches is suitable for standard bar heights (41-43 inches), while a seat height of 24-27 inches is appropriate for counter heights (35-37 inches). It's crucial to measure the height of your bar or counter before purchasing barstools to ensure a comfortable seating experience.

**How do I clean and maintain saddle style barstools with different seat materials?**
Cleaning and maintenance depend on the seat material. Vinyl seats can be easily cleaned with a damp cloth and mild detergent. Leather seats require regular conditioning to prevent cracking and drying. Fabric seats should be spot-cleaned immediately to prevent stains from setting. Wood seats should be wiped down with a damp cloth and occasionally polished with furniture polish. Regular cleaning and maintenance will prolong the life of your barstools.

**What factors should I consider when choosing barstools for outdoor use?**
For outdoor use, choose barstools made of weather-resistant materials such as aluminum, stainless steel, or treated wood. Look for stools with UV-resistant finishes to prevent fading and cracking. Consider stools with drainage holes to prevent water from pooling on the seat. Ensure that the stools are stable and able to withstand windy conditions.

Part 1 of 3...,"Feeling a bit slighted by Reese? Wondering what to do with all your newly found free time — and maybe even money? We’ve got you covered.

Reese has gone MIA — 11 days and nada. (the 2-year video doesn't count)...maybe it’s finally clear that her audience wasn’t a group of close friends — just followers being emotionally farmed for support, clicks, and cash.

Maybe you weren’t “her friends” like she always claimed.
Or maybe you're just tired of the drama. Because no matter how one tries to slice it, Reese's channel is as much drama as it is anything else. 

Perhaps finally weary of the same recycled content over and over and over and over? These things have a limit, after all.

Maybe, you feel stuck because you got into a routine of superchatting to feel seen, included, hear your name called out, or felt good you thought you were contributing to a struggling cult survivor, but slowly waking up to the fact that she isn't struggling and she isn't your real friend. That is parasocial fantasy. If you listen, she'll tell you the same. If this is you--I urge you to keep reading:

That doesn’t mean you were wrong to watch her — it just means it’s time to stop settling. Better creators exist. Ones who show up consistently, don’t manipulate, and actually earn your attention.

And hey — or keep watching Reese. What do I care? This ain't a cult.

🧭 Creators To Watch Instead (And Why...)

Whether you watched Reese for the crude humor, emotional connection, cult content, waffling and judgemental Christian undertones, or just something familiar to play in the background, here are creators who deliver that same comfort — without the guilt-tripping, manipulating. dry begging, or sad fishing 🎣 😕.

These creators respect their audience enough to put in the real work to bring you binge-worthy, high-quality, fresh, and passionate content.

My #1 vote is for Jaime French...I've been binge-watching her content the last couple of weeks. She's everything in Reese I thought I had or wanted, and didn't realize what I was missing.

Jaime has passion for her channel, learning the ins and outs of YT to ensure content worthy of her viewers' time...always looking for fresh ideas, never stale, has impressive editing skills...she's actually a great singer (album coming out), she's on tour for stand-up comedy, is a professional make-up artist, good decorating skills, and does the best impressions without resorting to low-brow mocking ""impressions"". (her Jennifer Coolidge and Celine Dion are to die for 😆.) High-qualiry content.

👎 What Reese Critics Have Pointed Out (and These Creators Don’t Do)

These are recurring issues across platforms and comments — not baseless hate:

• Dry begging: Constant references to burnout and algorithm struggles, framed as “just sharing,” but clearly meant to pull in sympathy and engagement.

• Parasocial manipulation: “You’re my friends,” “We’re in this together,” and “I’m just like you” — until she disappears with no explanation.

• Low-effort content: Selfie-cam rants, generic skits, same punchlines in different hoodies.

• Excessive consumption: Constant hauls, clothes that don’t fit, and décor overload — more than she can even use, wear, or display.

• Undercut relatability: She lives on her family’s 400-acre, multi-million-dollar ranch — confirmed through her own videos and stories. Whether she lives there free or gets the family discount is not clear, but the access and privilege are clear. It’s a far cry from the struggling everymom persona she often leans into. Keep in mind she has never disclosed this information or admitted to it further--ot was her son who let it slip in a live. As far as I know she has always led her audience to believe she was struggling to find a place, unsure of how she would afford it, and complains constantly about the house even though it sits on a multi-million ranch.

1mf7qti,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1mf7qti/anybody_else_ever_feel_the_urge_to_be_unnaturally/,Anybody else ever feel the urge to be unnaturally charismatic in social situations?,"Whenever I find myself in a public area, say a Cafe, I find myself feeling unnaturally social. I feel the need to say things that are just ... so extra. I get loud, enthusiastic, and I make all these dumb jokes that really aren't particularly funny. And once I leave, I'm always like, ""why on earth did I just say that"" and spiral into negative self-talk. It's not like I'm being something I'm not. I'm just exaggerating my personality and I don't notice it until afterwards because I'm so distracted talking to people.

I wouldn't say that I make people uncomfortable. I just feel like that I always tend to be overly myself, and I struggle trying to be less ... myself. It's as if whenever I'm anywhere, I feel this extreme urge to broadcast my entire personality across the northern hemisphere and seek the approval of everyone around me, and I hate it. Being the main character is great if you're trying to audition for a theater role, but in social situations, it subconsciously puts me above everyone and I fucking hate it, especially since I want to form deep friendships.

I'm being overly general, but let me give specific examples.

* At Peet's Coffee, I'll be packing up my laptop near closing time. Employee is talking to another employee about how someone is complaining that they keep moving the chairs. I impulsively raise my voice and playfully shout, ""stop moving the chairs"". They will look at me a little confused and move on.
* Ordering coffee at Starbucks. I say, ""Hi how are you?"" And they say, ""Good. How are you?"" And I'll respond with at a slightly higher volume than natural, ""I'm emotionally unstable and I need therapy."" He'll give me a slight chuckle, and he'll say, ""Really?"" And I'll say very bluntly, ""No."" ""Oh, ok haha."" And we'll just proceed with the order.
* Whenever I talk to a group of people, I always feel this strong urge to show off some animation or song I made to everyone. In the past, this has been the way for me to win the approval of others, but nowadays it just turns me into ""the center of attention"" and, once again, I turn into a spectacle.
* I'll order a lemonade, and the girl will ask me, ""Would you like a straw with that"" and I'll say, ""Yes. Thank you."" And then I'll say ironically, ""You're doing a great job."" And give them a thumbs up.

I hope you can see what I mean. I don't think I'm being particularly harmful. In fact, most of these interactions are quite fun and I often make them smile. I just feel like for some reason my baseline instinct is to turn into a real life cartoon character. And I'm doing it out of insecurity and I fucking hate it. I know part of the issue is that I'm really, really lonely. I'm 20 years old and estranged, and I've been like this for almost a year and still don't even have a real proper friend I can connect and hangout with.

I'm too poor to afford therapy, and I'm always so busy with work. I'm just stressed and sad, and I wish I could control myself and just be ... normal. I'm tired of being the center of attention everywhere I go, and I'm tired of subconsciously placing myself above everyone. I just want to connect, but I'm being held back by this unnatural amount of charisma that comes out at the most inappropriate times.

Perhaps it's hypomania talking. I have Bipolar II, after all. Or maybe it's a mixture of AuDHD and CPTSD. I really don't know anymore, but I do know that I want to stop. And I guess a part of me is afraid of being invisible and alone forever, and I know I could just shut the fuck up and be completely unnoticeable, but I also don't want to be alone, and right now, I feel like I'm doing a really shitty job of being not alone despite trying so hard not to be.

I'm struggling, man. Making friends feels next to impossible outside of school. I live in one of the most densely populated places on the planet (the Bay Area), and I've never felt more alone.

This is really more of a rant than anything. I'm talking about basic social skills, and I suppose I was wondering how the rest of you guys handle social interactions and making friends, especially coming from parents who condition you from birth to base your self worth on the attention you get from others.",2,1754081093.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I wasn’t supposed to get a brain scan. I was scheduled for a minor surgery—gallbladder removal. Nothing scary. I’d been having strange abdominal pain for months, finally got the referral and a date.

The surgeon’s office called me a week before the procedure. “Just one last thing; we’d like to get some imaging cleared beforehand.” I thought it was a formality. A precaution. So I showed up at Midtown Memorial for the MRI. It’s one of those hospitals that looks fine from the outside but kind of falls apart inside. Stained tiles, burnt-out lights, and that waiting room smell of lemon cleaner mixed with old coffee.

The MRI tech was a guy named Wes. He was in his early 40s, pale, and quiet. He looked like someone who used to be in a band but now just listens to music alone in his car. “You’ll hear a lot of noise. Try not to move. If you feel nauseous, squeeze the panic bulb, and we’ll stop the scan.” It seemed normal enough.

If you’ve never had an MRI, it’s like being locked in a plastic tube while someone jackhammers the outside. It’s loud in a way that disrupts your whole body. About halfway through, I heard a soft, ringing tone. It wasn’t part of the machine. It sounded like a wine glass being played—a pure, high sound. It felt like it was inside my head. I almost pressed the panic bulb. Then the scan finished.

When I came out, Wes was already at the monitor. He didn’t look at me. “Okay, you’re good to go.” I asked if everything looked normal. He hesitated, then smiled quickly. “Yeah. Just a little artifact. The neurologist might want a follow-up.” He handed me my papers and basically shoved me out the door.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I went to the fridge for water and saw a photo: me, Lisa, and Toby at her cousin’s cabin. It was taken a few summers ago. Only… I didn’t remember the dog. Not just his name—the entire dog. There he was in the picture, curled between us, and I was holding the leash. But I had no memory of him.

I called Lisa. We’re still friendly. “What was our dog’s name?” “Toby?” “Right. Sorry, brain fog.” “You okay?” “Yeah… do you have any pictures of him?” “Dan, you took most of them.” I checked Google Photos—there were dozens. Toby at the lake, Toby in a Halloween costume, Toby on my lap. None of it felt real.

I requested my MRI images. When they came, I opened the file. Dead center in the scan was a perfect black circle. Not a tumor, not a blur. Just a void. And in the corner, the label read: “Region of non-data.”

I called the hospital. I got transferred five times and left voicemails. When I finally reached someone, they told me there was no MRI on file. No technician named Wes, no appointment. I checked my voicemail. The original message—the one confirming the scan—was now just static.

This morning, I woke up and realized I couldn’t remember my mom’s birthday. I know she was born in April. I know she likes carrot cake. I remember her voice, her laugh, her hands. But her birthday? Gone. If anyone out there has experienced something similar—missing memories, strange scans, false photo memories—please let me know. I think there’s a hole in my brain, and I think it’s starting to pull everything else in with it.

Edit: If this post disappears or if my account vanishes, please comment my name. Daniel Mercer. Even if you don’t know me. Maybe memory is stronger when it’s shared.

Part 2:

It’s not just memories anymore.

At first, I blamed stress and lack of sleep. I thought the memory lapses were just part of getting older, with too many tabs open in my head. Names, faces, the usual things. I’d forget someone’s name at work or lose track of why I walked into a room. Nothing serious.

But now I’m noticing something else.
I’m not just forgetting.
I’m being forgotten.

I went to work Monday morning and scanned my badge like I always do.
The reader flashed red. It didn’t open the gate.
The security guard looked up from his tablet.

“You new?”

“No. I’m Daniel Mercer. I work in Logistics.”

He tapped the screen a few times, not really looking at me.

“You with Facilities?”

I frowned. “No, I just told you—Logistics. Third floor. I’ve been here three years.”

“Well, you’re not showing up in the system,” he said. “Unless you’ve got something that proves you work here, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”

I stood there, confused. I dug through my email, trying to find a pay stub or company memo—anything with my name on it—when I heard someone call out:

“Daniel?”

It was Janice from HR. She had just come off the elevator.

“He’s good,” she told the guard. “He works here.”
She waved her badge and buzzed me through.
I rode the elevator up in silence.

Everything looked normal on my floor. The same coffee smell, the same copier whine. People I recognized talked like nothing was wrong.

But when I walked to my desk, someone else was sitting there.

He turned, polite but confused.

“Can I help you?”

I stared at him. Then I looked at the nameplate on the desk.

Not mine.

And my name? It wasn’t anywhere.

Not on the door. Not on the wall-mounted staff chart. Not in the project tracker we keep printed above the copier.

It was like I’d never worked there at all.

That night, I went through my photo backups.

I needed to see something familiar. Something solid. Something that still made sense.

Some of the files were in my cloud—by name. But when I clicked them, they opened to blank white screens. No error, no corruption. Just nothing.

Others opened fine. Sort of.

In one photo from college, I’m sitting next to my old roommate, Nate. We’re laughing, red Solo cups in hand, mid-toast.
I remember that night being loud, silly, and fun.

In the next photo—same night, same table—he’s not there.
Just me, same pose, same cup. The chair beside me is empty.

I called his number. Disconnected.

I searched for him on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram.
Nothing.
No tags. No comments. No old photos with mutual friends.

Even pictures I know he was in now have gaps—spaces where he should be. Everyone is looking slightly in the wrong direction.

The next day, I drove to Midtown Memorial.
I had to see the place again. The building, the front desk, the room with the MRI machine.
But when I got there, the hospital was shut down.

The glass doors were covered in plywood. The sign was gone. A “For Lease” banner hung crookedly above the awning.

Everything smelled faintly of dust and disinfectant. Not old, but empty.

A woman passing by saw me staring and slowed.

“You okay?”

“This hospital,” I said. “When did it close?”

She gave me a funny look.

“Years ago. Lack of funding during COVID. They never reopened.”

“But I had a scan here last week.”

She didn’t say anything. She just nodded uncomfortably and kept walking.

So I called an old friend, Cora.

We hadn’t talked in a long time, but she still worked at a private imaging clinic downtown. I told her I had a scan I needed a second opinion on, something personal.

She agreed to meet after hours.

We loaded the file on her system. She didn’t say anything for almost a full minute.
Then she leaned back, crossed her arms, and said:
“Dan, this isn’t a tumor. This isn’t damage. This is nothing. This is missing data, like a piece of your brain never got scanned.”

She zoomed in on the black circle at the center.

“It’s too clean, too symmetrical. It doesn’t look biological. It looks manufactured.”
She opened the metadata to check the file logs—then froze.

“Why is there an audio file embedded in this?”

“What?”

“MRIs don’t record sound like this. There shouldn’t be an audio track.”

She hit play.

That same tone from the machine came through the speakers.

High, smooth, almost melodic. A soft, pure note that felt like it was vibrating inside my head again.

She muted the playback. It didn’t stop.
We had to shut the entire system down before the sound finally cut off.

Last night, I caught my reflection in the mirror acting strange.

It wasn’t a glitch. It wasn’t the lighting.
It smiled before I did.
Then it didn’t move at all when I turned away.

Here’s what I think:
The void in my brain isn’t just growing.
It’s moving.

I think it’s using me, like I’m a tear in something I don’t understand.
A hole in reality.
And things are falling through—people, memories, places.

Not being forgotten.

Being erased.

If anyone remembers Nate Alston—brown hair, played bass, horror nerd, lived in Santa Cruz around 2010—please comment. Even just his name. Anything.

Because if no one else remembers him…

he’s already gone.


Part 3:

I’m writing this down on whatever I can find, receipts, paper towels, the inside of my jacket. I carved a note into my desk with a pen. Every night, the digital stuff disappears. Every morning, I remember less.

I went to my mom’s house today.

Actually, I tried to.

The address is still in my phone. I followed the directions, turned onto the street, and passed the familiar gas station with the broken sign.

But when I got to the corner lot…

There was nothing.

No house. No driveway. No mailbox. Just grass, knee-high and brittle. A chain-link fence with no gate. No rubble. No signs of demolition. Just an empty patch of land that shouldn’t be empty.

I got out of the car and stood there for a while. The sun was too bright. The air smelled strange.

I used to sit on that porch. I scraped my knee on those concrete steps. I buried a box of Pokémon cards in the backyard when I was nine.

I knocked on the neighbor’s door. A man answered, looking cautious.

“Do you remember who used to live here?” I asked.
He stared at the lot, then at me.
“Nobody,” he said. “There’s never been a house there.”

He shut the door before I could ask anything else.

I’ve started leaving notes around the apartment. One next to my bed: “Your name is Daniel Mercer.” One on the fridge: “Cora remembers you.”

Sometimes I wake up and they’re gone.

Sometimes I find them crumpled in the trash—and I don’t remember throwing them away.

Tonight I passed by the TV on my way to the kitchen. It was off, just a black screen reflecting the room behind me.

But something was wrong.
My reflection was smiling.

I wasn’t.

I stood there, not moving. My reflection kept smiling. Then its mouth shifted, slow and deliberate, like it was mouthing words.

One more day.
That’s what it said. No sound. Just lips.
Then it stopped smiling.

I grabbed a blanket and threw it over the TV.

Then I went to the bathroom and covered the mirror too.

Then I called Cora.

I told her things were worse. It wasn’t just memory anymore. It wasn’t just people or places.

It was me.

She didn’t ask questions.

“Come in after hours,” she said. “I’ll run it again.”

Same machine. Same whine drilling through the center of my skull.

Afterward, I didn’t ask right away. Neither did she.

Then Cora turned the screen toward me.

Almost all of it was black. Not corrupted, just missing. Erased like it had never been scanned in the first place.

Only a sliver remained. A dim outline of what used to be.

She tapped it gently.

“There’s about ten percent left,” she said.

“Of the scan?”

She looked at me for a long moment.

“Of you.”

I think I’m being un-written. Line by line. Name by name. Like reality is deleting the draft.

She printed a copy and handed it to me. I folded it and put it in my glovebox. I haven’t looked at it since.

I don’t want to know if that last piece disappears too.

If you’re reading this, please say my name. Daniel Mercer. Say Nate Alston. Say Cora. Even if you don’t know them. Even if this sounds fake.

Because I think memory might be stronger than whatever this is. And if I forget everything…

You might be the only reason I ever existed at all.


Part 4. (Finale):

I woke up on the floor. 
I had no idea how I got there or how long I’d been there. 

It was quiet. Light came through the blinds, but it wasn’t warm. It was just colorless and still. 

I looked at the ceiling for a long time, thinking maybe I’d left a note there. Something to hold onto. 
But there was nothing. 

I used to have a name. I’m sure of it. 
I think I liked it. It felt like mine. 
But I can’t remember what it sounds like anymore. 

I haven’t eaten in, I don’t know. Food feels like something that happens to other people. 

There was someone. 
Cora. Her name is still here, somewhere just under the skin. I remember the way she looked at me. Not the shape of her face, just the weight in her eyes. 
It felt like she wanted to say, “You’re still here.” 
I wish I’d gone to her just to hear her say it again. 

I went to the car instead. 
I opened the glovebox. 
The scan was still there, folded like I’d left it. 
I unfolded it and held it to the light. 
It was blank. 
Just blank. 
It felt like even the paper forgot me. 

The mirror doesn’t show anything, but I still look. 
I still hope. 
I don’t know why. 

The TV is off. 
The windows are gray. 
The fridge doesn’t hum anymore. 
Even the silence feels tired. 

I haven’t said anything out loud today. 
I tried once, but the sound didn’t stick. 
It just fell out of my mouth and disappeared. 

I think I’m still here, but I don’t know what part of me is. 

Please, if you’re reading this, say something. Tell me I’m still here.

Say her name, Cora. 

Say yours. Say mine, if you know it. I can’t. Not anymore. 

If this post disappears, just leave something behind. 

A word, a sound, anything.

And honestly, there's no better place to hit that reset button than Hawaii. The vibrant green landscape, the turquoise water, the feeling of serenity. Perfection.  

So, what does a Hawaiian-style “feed cleanse"" look like?   

* Swap doom-scrolling in bed for a sunrise coffee, overlooking the ocean.  Picture sunlight hitting the water, a gentle breeze, and the sound of distant waves. Total bliss. 

* Trade social feeds for actual feeds – of fish! Snorkeling or diving in Hawaii's clear waters is next-level. Seeing the vibrant marine life is better than any highlight reel. 

* Switch notification checks for calming nature walks. Whether it's a secluded beach or a jungle trail, Hawaii makes it easy to just “be” ... 

* Replace online 'likes' with real-life connections. Hawaii’s famous Aloha spirit isn’t just a vibe, it’s a way of life. Some of most memorable moments can come from chatting with locals, learning about island traditions and experiencing the culture firsthand.  

It’s not just about disconnecting, it’s about being present and letting natural beauty wash away the digital noise. No agenda, just pure relaxation.

(Ima do Joshua next btw)


1: Always Smells Like Coffee & Ink. A combo of espresso and the ink from his sketchbooks. Some swear it’s comforting—like an old bookstore. (Maybe with a small hint of cigarettes as well).

2: this boy owns 10+ Pairs of Sunglasses. He claims they’re “functional,” but secretly picks the ones that match his outfit and mood.

3: Besides rap, i feel like he'd Sings Old Funk and Jazz While Cleaning. He doesn't try to sing well, but he’s surprisingly good—deep, gravelly, and warm.

4: Writes Poetry on Napkins. Most are spontaneous haiku or beat-style poems. He tucks the best ones into the pages of borrowed books or gives them out with drinks.

5: This man is Sketchbook Hoarder. Keeps every sketchbook he's ever filled. There's a stack taller than him somewhere in a hidden. Some have detailed concept art of Noise forms he never released.

6: Uses Latte Art to Communicate Mood. A skull? Don’t test him. A smiley face? He’s in a good mood. A Noise symbol? Sit down, we need to talk.

7: he has Backup Coffee Beans for the Apocalypse. They're sealed in a warded tin behind a false wall in WildKat. Only the Composer and a very desperate Player would know the code to open it.

8: i feel like he'd have Selective Memory. He remembers conversations down to tone and body language. but often forgets what day it is or where he put his mug.

9: I feel like he gives Other Angels a Headache. Especially when he was younger. They would think hes ""Too emotional, too involved, too human"". He’s been warned more than once. but keeps meddling anyway.

10: Has a Favorite Mug He Won’t Let Anyone Touch. It's chipped, covered in stickers, and Joshua once used it by accident. Sanae didn’t speak to him for 3 days.

11: I like to imagine him Plays Chess Against Himself now and then. The pieces are marked “Composer” and “Producer.” He swears it helps him strategize. but also sometimes argues with the board.

12: Still Wonders If He Did the Right Thing About everything. but especially Neku’s game. Even now, he watches the city from above, hoping his coffee and words were enough.
(HE ALWAYS DOSE ENOUGH DANG IT 😭)

13: Talks to himself in shorthand. Mumbles phrases like ""Neku's frequency's off today"" or stuff like that, as if he's narrating a tuning session no one else is hearing.

14: Has an Emotional Soft Spot for Neku. Even if he plays it cool, he keeps tabs on Neku more than anyone else (besides Joshua). There’s pride there. And concern.


Ill mostly add more and fix any spelling errors and stuff later.

We’ve been dodging cheating allegations from a roommate we had who we just kicked out. 
Yesterday I messaged her and I asked her if she was coming back for the rest of her things, and it escalated and I was in a petty mood and said “still waiting to hear how boyfriend is cheating on me😂😂😂” she mentioned having screenshots

When I mentioned this to boyfriend later, thinking we would laugh it off, he got very angry, raised his voice and gave me shit for ‘stirring the shit pot and causing him more stress’. About 20 minutes later he comes and apologizes and gets me to block her Snapchat infront of him. 

I’m confronting him when he gets home from work and asking about it all. 

I’m NOT saying I’m going to forgive him, not at all, I’m just weighing my options here and prepare my thoughts and mentality. 





ETA: There’s more to the story that I forgot to post- the roommate was extremely manipulative. She used to take credit for all the cleaning, dishes, laundry and whatnot but she didn’t. She used to talk to him and I about each other, often telling each of us “we can do this without the other” and pushing my bf and I away from each other. 
I woke up one morning at 5:30 am and they were both gone, and went “for coffee” but I had a mental breakdown that morning and she ended up getting in my face, I shoved her back and she came and physically fought me. 
Things changed after that, my bf become attentive again, our relationship healed. Now this came out and his reaction said it all.

If you've been feeling fatigued, struggling with ""brain fog,"" or finding it difficult to manage your weight, you've likely come across **mitolyn reviews**. The product claims to tackle these issues at a cellular level by focusing on mitochondrial health. But is this a genuine solution or just another fleeting trend?

I've been on a personal journey to understand the real science behind wellness, and as part of that, I decided to take a closer look at Mitolyn. After using the product myself and diving into its ingredients, customer feedback, and the scientific principles it's based on, I'm ready to share my honest, in-depth analysis.

## Mitolyn Product Overview
Mitolyn is a dietary supplement designed to enhance cellular energy and support overall metabolic function. It's not a stimulant-based ""fat burner"" that gives you a jittery energy rush. Instead, it focuses on the mitochondria—often called the ""powerhouses of the cell""—which are responsible for converting food into usable energy. As we age or deal with stress and environmental toxins, our mitochondria can become less efficient, leading to fatigue, weight gain, and a general lack of vitality.

Mitolyn's formula is built on the principle of supporting these cellular powerhouses to improve energy production from the ground up. The creators have brought together a blend of natural ingredients, each selected for its scientifically backed role in mitochondrial health, antioxidant protection, and metabolic function. This approach is intended to provide a more sustainable and foundational boost to your health, rather than a temporary fix.

### Who Is Mitolyn For?
This supplement is particularly designed for people who:

* Experience persistent fatigue or ""afternoon crashes.""
* Struggle with mental fog and lack of focus.
* Are looking to support their body's natural metabolism for weight management.
* Want to boost physical stamina and recovery.
* Are seeking a non-stimulant alternative to traditional energy boosters.



## The Science Behind How Mitolyn Works
To understand Mitolyn, you have to understand the mitochondria. These tiny organelles within our cells are where a process called oxidative phosphorylation occurs, which generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—the primary energy currency of the cell. When this process is slow or inefficient, your body's energy production suffers.

Mitolyn aims to improve this process in a few key ways:

1. **Mitochondrial Biogenesis:** Some of its ingredients are believed to help stimulate the creation of new mitochondria. More mitochondria mean more cellular power plants, which can lead to increased energy production.
2. **Antioxidant Support:** The process of energy creation can produce harmful byproducts called free radicals, which can damage mitochondria over time. Mitolyn contains powerful antioxidants to neutralize these free radicals, protecting your cellular health.
3. **Nutrient Transport:** The supplement includes components that help shuttle fatty acids into the mitochondria so they can be burned for fuel. This is a critical step in a healthy metabolism and can be particularly beneficial for weight management.

By targeting these fundamental cellular mechanisms, Mitolyn aims to create a systemic improvement in energy and metabolism, rather than just masking the symptoms. This is a more holistic and long-term approach to wellness.



## A Deep Dive into Mitolyn Ingredients
The effectiveness of any supplement comes down to its ingredients. Mitolyn contains a proprietary blend of natural compounds, and a close look at the key players reveals why it might be so effective.

* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):** A vital compound for the electron transport chain, a core part of ATP production. CoQ10 is also a potent antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress. According to sources like the Mayo Clinic, CoQ10 is well-known for its role in energy production and heart health.
* **Pterostilbene:** A powerful antioxidant found in blueberries, similar to resveratrol. It is believed to support mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative stress. Pterostilbene is a key ingredient for both its antioxidant properties and its potential to activate cellular energy pathways.
* **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** This ingredient is fascinating because studies have suggested it can promote mitochondrial biogenesis—the creation of new mitochondria. This is a rare and powerful benefit that can lead to a more profound and lasting increase in energy.
* **L-Carnitine:** This amino acid plays a crucial role in fat metabolism. It helps transport fatty acids from the bloodstream into the mitochondria, where they can be burned for energy. This makes it a key component for anyone looking to support their body's ability to use fat as fuel.
* **Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA):** A powerful antioxidant that works with CoQ10 and L-Carnitine to support mitochondrial function. ALA is also known to help with blood sugar regulation, which can be beneficial for overall metabolic health.

The combination of these ingredients is what makes the Mitolyn formula unique. They work synergistically to address different aspects of mitochondrial and metabolic health, providing a comprehensive approach to energy and wellness.

## My Personal Mitolyn Experience: The Pros & Cons
When I began taking Mitolyn, I didn't expect a quick, dramatic change. The company's philosophy is centered on a gradual, cumulative effect, and that's precisely what I experienced.



### The Pros: Noticeable, Sustainable Benefits
* **Consistent Energy, No Crash:** Within the first two weeks, I noticed a subtle but definite shift. My usual mid-afternoon slump started to disappear. I wasn't wired or jittery; instead, I felt a stable, consistent energy throughout the day. This allowed me to be more productive without relying on coffee or sugary snacks.
* **Improved Mental Clarity:** One of the most significant benefits was the reduction in ""brain fog."" My focus improved, and I found it easier to concentrate on complex tasks for more extended periods. This is a key benefit for anyone with a demanding job or a busy lifestyle.
* **Better Sleep and Recovery:** I also noticed an unexpected but welcome improvement in my sleep quality. I was waking up feeling more refreshed, and my body seemed to recover faster after workouts. This is likely due to the enhanced cellular repair that comes with improved mitochondrial function.
* **Gentle on the Stomach:** I didn't experience any of the digestive issues or adverse side effects that are common with many supplements. The stimulant-free, natural formula was easy for my body to tolerate.



### The Cons: What to Consider
* **Results Take Time:** This is not a magic pill. You won't see dramatic changes overnight. The effects build gradually over weeks and months. If you're looking for an instant boost, this may not be the right product for you.
* **Unmanaged Weight Loss:** While the product helps support a healthy metabolism, it's not a ""weight loss pill"" in the traditional sense. It won't make you lose weight without a healthy diet and exercise. It works best as a support tool for a healthy lifestyle.



## Verified Customer Reviews and Expert Opinions
My experience aligns with many of the Mitolyn reviews I've read from other customers. A common theme is the focus on subtle, foundational changes rather than instant gratification.

For example, a verified customer, Sarah from California, wrote, ""I was skeptical at first, but after a month, the difference in my energy and mental clarity was undeniable. I'm no longer reaching for a third cup of coffee, and my workouts feel so much better.""

In the world of functional medicine, the importance of mitochondrial health is a well-established concept. Experts and medical sources like WebMD and Healthline often discuss how mitochondrial dysfunction can be a root cause of fatigue and metabolic issues. The approach of targeting these cellular mechanisms with scientifically-backed ingredients like CoQ10 and PQQ is gaining significant traction and is considered a trustworthy way to support long-term health.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Is Mitolyn safe?
Mitolyn is formulated with natural ingredients that are generally considered safe for most people. The company manufactures its products in GMP-certified facilities, which ensures high-quality standards. However, as with any supplement, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before starting, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications. The FDA does not approve dietary supplements, but it does regulate the manufacturing process.



### How long does it take for Mitolyn to work?
While some people report subtle changes in energy within the first few weeks, the most noticeable and long-lasting benefits typically appear after 60 to 90 days of consistent use. The supplement works to rebuild cellular health, which is a process that takes time. For optimal results, a longer-term commitment is recommended.



### Are there any side effects?
The formula is stimulant-free, so it doesn't cause jitters, anxiety, or heart palpitations. Most users report no adverse side effects. A small number of people might experience mild digestive discomfort during the first few days as their body adjusts, but this is rare and usually subsides quickly. Taking the supplement with food can help mitigate any potential stomach sensitivity.



## Conclusion: Is Mitolyn Worth Your Money?
After a deep dive into the science, my personal experience, and a review of customer feedback, I can confidently say that Mitolyn is a legitimate and effective supplement. It stands out in a crowded market by moving beyond temporary fixes and focusing on the core, cellular health that underpins our energy and metabolism.

While it's not a shortcut to a perfect body or endless energy, it is a powerful tool for supporting your body's natural systems. If you're tired of feeling fatigued and want to address the root cause of your low energy and sluggish metabolism, Mitolyn is an excellent choice. The benefits I've experienced—sustained energy, improved mental clarity, and better sleep—are real and have made a noticeable difference in my daily life.

If you're looking for a supplement to help you feel more energetic, focused, and revitalized, Mitolyn may be precisely what you need.

1mf7h56,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanGrupeHorror/comments/1mf7h56/misfortune_of_a_pizza_guy/,Misfortune of a pizza guy,"If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be “nobody”. I blend into the background so well, most of my classmates from high school don't even remember me. My name is John. At least it's what I go by. Nobody gets my actual first name right. I am a twenty three year old guy who still lives at home. My deadbeat father walked out when I was two and I was raised by my mother. I barely graduated high school. I don't know how I didn't have to repeat any years. I've given up on the thought of ever having a girlfriend. Now, I deliver pizzas. Still not knowing what I want to do with the rest of my life. The only escape I have from reality is stories. On what few breaks I had, I would read short stories on my phone. I would listen to conspiracy podcasts while I drove. Most of the time, I would imagine myself in these stories. Just to feel like I was important for once in my life. 



I was driving on the highway one night to my next delivery. It was just another night of a sixteen hour shift, podcasts, and praying that my shit box of a car wouldn't break down. My manager Kyle, who knew that I was already on my third day this week of working this long, caught me as I was about to punch out. He said since I was still technically on the clock, I had to take this last delivery. Without overtime pay mind you. I tried to imagine a wendigo busting down the front door and consuming him. But, for the thousandth time, nothing happened and I was in my car on my way to the delivery.   



The smell of the pizza on my passenger seat was making my mouth water. I had to mentally smack myself and refrain from sneaking a slice and blaming it on the kitchen. The podcast I was listening to was talking about some banned books and the impact of government overreach. I imagined myself smuggling books into the U.S. under the nose of federal agents. I felt my head starting to bob. I was so tired. Every so often, I would hit a pot hole that would snap me awake and I would listen to make sure that nothing was wrong with the car. I was really trying to save up for a new one. Or, at least, one that didn't have more rust and duct tape than anything else. I was also paying rent to my mother while I still lived with her. She insisted that I didn't have to, but I needed to do something. With her working as a nurse and my long hours, we barely saw each other anyway. I felt my eye lids get heavy. Maybe I could pull over for a minute and get a micro nap. No. I needed to get this done so I could go home. Despite my efforts, I closed my eyes for a brief moment. I looked up and saw headlights coming toward me. I grabbed the wheel and tried to steer out of the way. But I was too late. I heard the crunch of metal as I hit the oncoming vehicle. I looked past my steering wheel and saw a blur as someone got out of the back seat and ran into the woods. Before I could do anything else, everything faded to black. 



The next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital room. It was the hospital my mom worked at. A nurse came in. “Oh good. You're awake.” I looked around. “What happened?” She walked over and looked at my chart. “You were in an accident. Another car swerved into your lane and hit you head on. It's a miracle you only had a minor concussion.” I sat up and examined myself. I didn't appear to have any injuries aside from a small bump on my forehead. Another nurse came in holding a bundle of my clothes. She set them on a chair and left. “Well,” said the first nurse. I didn't see a name tag. “Once you get dressed, you are free to go. Just come in if you have any questions or have any pain.” I thanked her and she left. After putting on my clothes, I left the room I was in and began walking down the familiar halls toward the exit. It was surprisingly quiet today. I passed the front desk and the receptionist nodded to me as I stepped out into the cool night air. I looked at my wrist out of habit to see the time. But my watch was gone.  Must have been ripped off in the accident. I pulled out my phone. The screen was completely shattered. Signing to myself, I began walking home. Luckily for me, it was only a couple of blocks away. The town I lived in wasn't very big. I guessed that I wouldn't have a job starting tomorrow. I knew that Kyle was the kind of guy to care more about the failed delivery than my well being. But, there was nothing I could do about it. The silence of the night was deafening. The only sound I could hear was the wind rustling the trees dotting the side walks. Normally I would put an earbud in and turn on some music when I walked. But since I couldn't do that, I decided to let my imagination run wild. I imagined myself fighting against a horde of zombies. Keeping the oncoming swarm at bay with machine guns and molotov cocktails.  



I was about half way home when I heard footsteps behind me. Snapping back to reality, I looked back and saw someone walking with their hands in their pockets and a hood concealing their face. I just shrugged to myself and continued walking. Even if it was a mugger, it wasn't like I had anything valuable on me worth stealing. It was then that I heard the sound of a vehicle approaching from behind. It passed me and parked along the sidewalk. Glancing around, I realized that there weren't any other cars driving by. I moved to the other side of the sidewalk to give the vehicle a wide berth. Once I was closer, I saw that it was a blacked out Suburban. The back passenger door opened. I heard the footsteps speed up behind me and I felt myself being shoved into the back seat. As soon as the door closed, a gag was put into my mouth and a hood was placed over my head. 



They drove for what felt like an hour in silence. Trying to guess where we were going blindfolded was way harder than the movies made it look. The driver pulled to a stop and I was dragged out of the SUV. I tried to go limp, but it was no use. The two people carrying didn't even slow down. I felt them slam me into a chair and zip ties put on my wrists. The hood was ripped off and I squinted, waiting for my eyes to adjust. Looking around, I didn't know where I was. My guess was that it was one of the empty warehouses at the edge of town. All around us work lights were set up, all facing toward me. There were three people standing in front of me. All of them were dressed in black with their faces hidden under  their hoods. The one in the middle approached me. Kneeling down, I could make out the faint smell of cigarettes. “Where’s the lamb?” He asked. I just stared at him. “Huh?” The man sighed in frustration. “The girl! Where is she?” I just shook my head in confusion. “I- I don't know what you’re talking about.” I could see the man's jaw clenching. He stood up and reached into his pocket. At first I couldn't tell what he had pulled out, but I immediately recognized the shape of a bowie knife. “Guess we’ll have to do this the hard way.” He said as he moved closer. Before I could protest, I heard a muffled thump as the left side of the man's head erupted in a shower of red and white chunks. The other two tried to react, but another two thumps sounded and they were on the floor laying in growing pools of blood. I just stared at the bodies in disbelief. After a moment, there was the sound of footsteps approaching from my left. Out of the darkness, another man appeared. This one was carrying a rifle. He stopped a few feet away and stared at me. “Are you here to help me or kill me?” I asked after a painfully long moment of silence. The man walked over and picked up the dead man's knife. I closed my eyes and waited for him to stab me. Instead, he cut the zip ties holding my wrists in place. I felt the circulation return to my hands. I looked up at him. His face was covered by a balaclava. “Come with me,” he said, walking away in the direction he came from. I stood up and looked at the bodies on the ground. I didn't know what was going on, but at that moment, the man with the rifle seemed like a safer bet. 



The man led me to a pickup parked just outside the warehouse gate. After hopping in, he turned to me. “What did they ask you?” I stared at him for a moment. My mouth dry. He pulled off the balaclava revealing his face. I didn't recognize him. Being in a town as small as mine, you would have seen everybody at least once. He had short black hair with hints of grey along the edges. His blue eyes were bright and piercing as he waited for my response. “Um. They wanted to know where a girl was.” He nodded slowly. “And?” “They did say something about a lamb. But that was it.” He just turned and started the engine. We rode for several minutes in silence. I kept glancing at him waiting for some explanation as to what was going on, but he kept quiet. My mind was racing. I was just in a car accident and walking home from the hospital. Why was I kidnapped and questioned about a girl? Once my mind slowed down and I realized that trying to figure it out in my head was going to get me nowhere, I asked. “So. Who are you? And what's going on?” The man finally looked at me. “Call me Bill.” He looked back at the road. “Whats going on?” I asked again. Bill made a sharp turn and we were in an alleyway between the deli and laundry mat. After looking around again, Bill finally looked at me. “Those people are after my niece. The van you were in an accident with was transporting her. But she escaped after you crashed.” I thought back to the accident. I did see someone get out of the van and run into the woods before I blacked out. “Now, they think you helped her escape and know where she is.” Bill continued. I stared at him for a long moment. “Who are they exactly?” There was a flash of headlight behind us as a car drove past the alley. Bill just shook his head. “Later.” He pulled out and we continued to whatever destination he had in mind. I reached for my phone again to call someone. But I remembered that it was shattered. I didn't even know who I would call in this situation. The police, my mother? All I knew was that I just got caught up in something I was not ready for. “Where are we going?” I asked. We had driven all around in what seemed like random directions before he pulled onto a back road leading out of town. “I have a cabin not too far from here. If there's one safe place she might have gone, it would be there.”                    



We drove for another several miles before turning onto a dirt road leading us deeper into the woods. Looking out, the moonlight cast eerie shadows through the trees. If I wasn't worried about my life at that moment, I would be imagining some monsters lurking in those shadows waiting for a chance to strike. I lurched forward as Bill came to a stop in front of the cabin. It wasn't much to look at. Just a simple log cabin with moss growing on the side of it. I guessed that it was likely used as a hunting shack in the fall. I hopped out of the truck and approached it. Bill was grabbing something out of the back seat. I reached for the knob when the door flew open and I was face to face with a girl. I guessed that she was in her early twenties. She had long dirty blond hair tied into a pony tail. She had a pale complexion with freckles dotting her face and deep emerald eyes. She was wearing torn jeans and a grey hoodie. Honestly, she was probably one of the most beautiful girls I’ve met. Especially in this town. The only thing I found unattractive about her was the pistol she had pointed at my chest. I swallowed hard and raised my hands slowly. “Um. Friendly?” I said cautiously. She glanced behind me and lowered the gun. “Uncle!” Bill had come up behind me carrying a rifle case and two backpacks. The girl shoved past me and hugged Bill. “Are you alright?” He asked, patting her on the back with the hand holding the case. She pulled back and nodded. She looked back at me. “Whose he?” She asked. “Um. I’m John.” I stammered. Bill looked back down the driveway. “Lets head inside.” I turned and entered the cabin. The main area had a couch, coffee table, bear skin rug, and several deer heads mounted on the walls. By one corner, there was a wood stove and a small dining room table with two chairs. To the right, there were two doors. One led to a bedroom and the other was a small bathroom. I walked over and sat on one of the wooden chairs. The girl sat on the couch as Bill set the packs next to the stove. I looked between the two. “What now?” I asked. Bill rummaged through one of the packs and pulled out two items. He tossed one to me and one to the girl. “You two wait here. I’m going to try and take care of this mess.” I looked down at what he tossed at me. It was an MRE. “There are water bottles in the packs.” He turned to the girl. “Notify me if anything happens.” He said, handing her a cell phone. “Be careful,” she said. Bill nodded and left. 



After we could no longer hear the truck, we just sat there in silence for a while in awkward silence. “So,” I said. “I don't think I caught your name.” She set the pistol on the coffee table and opened her MRE. “It's Jess.” I nodded as she pulled out a pack of Skittles. I wasn't feeling all that hungry. “Whats your story?” I asked. “Oh, you know.” She said, getting up and fishing a water bottle from one of the packs. “My parents were part of a cult. They had me. And now the cult wants to sacrifice me to their god for world peace or some bullshit like that. You?” I just stared at her dumbly. I couldn't tell if she was being serious. “Um. I was just delivering a pizza.” I said. She snorted and went back to eating her food. “You were the one that ran into us?” She asked after a minute. I nodded. “Sorry about your car.” I just shrugged. “I’ll deal with that when this is over.” For the next couple of hours we made small talk. Mostly about movies and our hobbies. Or, more like her hobbies. I didn't have many outside of reading and listening to stories. But she did find some of the ones I told interesting. At least, I hope she did. Eventually, Jess fell asleep. I did my best to stay awake and listen for Bill to return. I thought about what Jess said. Did I really stumble into some cult dispute? If so, what was I supposed to do about it? Just wait till Bill dealt with it? After trying to come to terms with my situation, I heard the sound of a vehicle pulling up. I didn't want to wake Jess, so I quietly stepped out the front door. I figured Bill might need help with something. After stepping out, I felt like something was wrong. Bill didn't shut the engine off. The headlights were pointing toward the cabin, so I couldn't see. I tried to block the light with my hand while my eyes adjusted, I realized that it wasn't Bill's pickup. The black SUV pulled up and the doors opened. Before I could do anything, I felt something hit me hard in the back of the head. Next thing I knew, I was on the ground. I heard the sounds of gun shots and Jess screaming. Through my blurring vision, I could see two people dragging a squirming Jess out of the cabin and into the vehicle. I heard the doors shut and the crunching of gravel before everything faded to black. 



I awoke to the feeling of cold water being splashed on my face. I shook my head as my vision returned. I was met with a very agitated Bill standing over me. Looking around, I was sitting on the couch. There were spots of blood on the floor alongside spent pistol casings. “What happened?!” Bill yelled. I was still a little dizzy. “They showed up and took her.” I said. Bill turned and flipped the table following a trail of swearing that would make a sailor blush. After a minute, he calmed down and looked at me. “Come with me,” he said. I stood up, still a little disoriented. I followed him out of the cabin and to the back of his truck. The bed had one of those toppers on it. Bill opened the back and I was shocked to see an unconscious man tied and gagged laying there. “Help me get him inside.” Not knowing what else to do, I complied. We worked together and dragged the man inside. We placed one of the chairs in the middle of the room and tied him to it. I noticed that he had a tourniquet wrapped around one of his legs just above some bloody gauze covering what looked like a bullet wound. I looked at Bill with a questioning look. He just shrugged. “What? He was running.” Bill walked over to the packs and pulled out another bottle of water. He splashed our captive and followed with a few hard slaps to wake him up. The man stirred and shook his head. Once he focused on Bill, he tried to break free on his restraints. Realizing his resistance was useless, he looked between me and Bill. Bill took out the gag. “Where did they take her?” The man just laughed. “You can't stop what we are doing.” I saw Bill grit his teeth. He reached behind him and pulled out a revolver and pointed at the man. He just smiled. “You think you can scare me wi-” Bill cocked the hammer. “Alright alright.” The man hung his head. “The old bowling alley at the edge of town. The ritual is going to take place in the basement.” Damn. That was easy. Bill lowered the hammer. Raising his hand, Bill struck the man in the temple with the grip of the pistol, knocking him unconscious again. After putting the gag back in his mouth, Bill walked over to the rifle case he brought in earlier. I was still just standing there, stunned by the interaction. “Hey!” Bill yelled, snapping me out of my stupor. He tossed me a rifle. It was an AR 15 with a red dot sight. “You know how to use it?” He asked. I nodded and he pulled out more equipment. I didn't have the heart to tell him that the only experience I had with guns was movies and Call of Duty. But it couldn't be that hard. Just point and click. He handed me two magazines for the rifle and a pistol in a holster. After I shoved the mags into my pocket and clipped the holster to my belt, we left the cabin and hopped into the truck. I looked at Bill. “Are we just going to leave that guy here?” He started the engine and began driving. “He’s not going anywhere. And nobody’s going to hear him out here. Besides, if he is wrong, I’m going to need to question him some more.” We peeled onto the back road and made our way back to town. 



After we entered the town's edge, I broke the silence. “So, what is going on exactly?” Bill sighed. “My idiot of a brother joined a cult some years back. Said it gave him purpose. He met a woman there and they had Jess. The cult believes that if they sacrifice a child born from two of their members, they can summon their god and bring a new utopia.” I stared at him. I had thought that Jess was just messing with me. “So, you want to save her and prevent the ritual from happening?” He looked at me as though I just said the stupidest thing ever. “No. Their religion is bullshit. I want to keep a bunch of wannabe coolaid drinkers from killing my niece.” I just nodded and shut my mouth for the rest of the drive. We pulled into the parking lot of the bowling alley and climbed out. “Whats the plan?” I asked. Bill grabbed his rifle out of the back seat and chambered a round. “Go in quietly and shoot anyone that isn't Jess.” He started walking to the building. I looked back at the truck. The keys were still in the ignition. I could drive away. I could try to get the cops. But what was I going to tell them? Hey, two people I just met are fighting a cult and one of them is about to be sacrificed to a false god. Not likely they would believe me. Even if they did, it would be too late. I just shook my head and began following Bill.



 Instead of going in the front door, we maneuvered to the back. Parked by the rear exit, were three vehicles. One of them was the same SUV that took Jess. Bill moved forward and opened the door. We waited for a moment and listened. Nothing. We quietly pushed our way in and began looking for a stairway to the basement. I wasn't much for any kind of sports, so the only time I ever came here was in elementary school for an after class activity. After a few minutes of sweeping, we finally found a door labeled “basement”. Bill looked to me with an anticipating expression. I raised my rifle toward the door and nodded. He grabbed the door knob and slowly opened it. We stood there, our rifles aimed at the darkness. We could hear the faint sounds of chanting coming from the bottom of the stairwell. “Shit,” Bill hissed. “They’re starting.” He entered the doorway and I followed close after. We moved quietly until we reached the bottom. This was clearly where the excess equipment was stored. There were boxes of spare pins and bowling balls. Near the far end of the basement, we could see five individuals dressed in black cloaks standing around a stone altar. How they got that down there I wasn't sure. There were two cultists standing on either side and one at the center. With my eyes adjusted to the low light, I could make out the form of Jess laying on the altar. She was restrained and clearly struggling to escape. The chanting died down and the cultist in the middle raised his hand to the ceiling as another one pulled out a long black dagger from their cloak. As they raised it, me and Bill rushed out and began firing at the group. Bill took out the two on the left as I fired at the ones on the right. Even with my lack of experience, the two went down without issue. The dagger clattered to the floor next to the altar. Once the four were down, we aimed at the remaining cultists in the center. He looked at us with a look of disdain. “You dare interrupt our rit-” His words were cut off as we both unloaded into him. His body slumped against the altar. I ran up as Bill searched the basement for others that might have been hiding. Jess’ hands were bound behind her back and duct tape covering her mouth. I grabbed the dagger at my feet and cut the zip ties freeing her. As soon as she was free, she wrapped her arms around me and held me tight. Not knowing what else to do, I just patted her on the back. “Thank you,” she said, tears in her eyes. Bill came up behind us. “We should get going.” We both nodded. 



As we began walking to the stairs, I felt a chill run down my spine. I looked back to the last cultist and saw his blood pooling around him on the altar. I realized that the liquid was moving. It was beginning to form some sort of symbol I didn't recognize. As soon as it did, A black smoke began emanating from it as runes on the altar began to pulse with a deep purple light. Through the black smoke, I  began to see black and oily tendrils begin to emerge. We jumped back toward Bill as more of this thing became visible. It was massive. Filling up the whole ritual area. Its skin was black and glossy. There were several mouths all along the round bulbous body. Those tendrils I had seen earlier had begun wrapping around the bodies of the dead cultists and it was beginning to eat them. The bodies were lowered into the multiple mouths and the squishing and crunching sounds that followed made bile rise to my throat. After a moment, I saw Bill shake his head and begin firing at the creature. That snapped me to my senses and I followed suit. Even Jess took the pistol from Bill's holster and began firing. However, the thing didn't even seem to notice the bullets hitting it. Too focused on its meal. I happened to glance down and saw the black dagger laying on the floor where I had dropped it. The tendrils seemed to be avoiding it. I looked to Bill, “cover me.” Before he could say anything, I ran forward emptying the last magazine for the rifle. As I reached the altar, one of the tendrils wrapped around my right leg and I felt gravity shift as I was lifted into the air. The now empty rifle fell out of my hands. I drew the pistol and began firing wildly at the thing. Seeming more irritated than hurt, it slammed me against the ground, knocking the wind out of me. I looked to my right. The dagger. I managed to grab it just as I was once again in the air. The tendril began squeezing harder and I felt something crack in my leg. I let out a scream of pain and anger. The thing seemed amused at that. I reached up and slashed at the tendril. The blade cut through the flesh with ease as a spray of black fluid soaked my pant leg. The thing let out a shriek as it released me. I fell to the ground and landed hard on my left arm. I felt something crack. The adrenalin pumping through me was enough to make me ignore the pain and stand. With the dagger in my other hand, I bolted forward and began slashing at the things flesh. It let out more shrieks of pain the more I hacked at it. Eventually it lay still. I was covered in the things black viscous blood. I stood there. Amazed. I had actually killed a monster. Not in my imagination, but for real. I limped toward the others who were staring at me with amazement. The black smoke returned and the body of the thing was beginning to disappear into it. Jess and Bill each took one of my arms and helped me up the stairs. 



Once we were outside I asked Bill, “what now?” He chuckled and shook his head. “Well. These weren't the only members of this cult. If what we saw down there is really what they are trying to summon, we need to do something about it.” I nodded. My throat was feeling a bit dry. “Let's do it.” I said. They both grinned and we walked to the truck. Beep. I looked around. “Did you hear that?” I asked. They both turned to me. Beep. “Hear what?” Jess asked. I stopped and listened. Beep. “That!” They looked at each other and shrugged. Beep. I felt a pounding in my head. Beep. My vision began to blur. “Are you ok John?” Jess asked. Beep. I closed my eyes and shook my head. Beep. I forced my eyes open. I was staring at a white ceiling. I couldn't move. Beep. I looked to my right and could just make out the heartbeat monitor. Looking to my left I could see my mom asleep on one of the visitors chairs. I tried to speak, but there were tubes in my mouth. All I managed to get out was a grunt. This was enough to wake mom up. She jumped up and ran over to me. She was still wearing her scrubs. “John! Thank God.” She pushed the call button and ran to the door. “Doctor! He’s awake.” I didn't know what was going on. After a minute, a doctor came in. “John. Can you hear me?” I nodded slowly. “Good. You were in an accident and have been unconscious for the past week.” I stared at him. Unable to speak. That couldn't be right. I was just with Bill and Jess at the bowling alley. My accident happened yesterday. And I was fine. After a bit, they took the tubes out of my mouth. “Where’s Jess?” I managed to croak out. My throat was dry as hell. My mom looked at me confused. “Who is Jess?” I sat up. My right leg and left arm were in casts. 



After a while, I was informed that I had fallen asleep behind the wheel when I was delivering that last pizza. I had gone off the road and slammed into a tree. A passing car had noticed me and I was brought to the hospital. I tried to ask about Bill and Jess. But nobody knew who I was talking about. After I was released, I tried to drive myself out to Bill's cabin. But no matter which way I went, I couldn't find the back road to his driveway. I even went to the bowling alley and talked to the owner. He told me the place didn't have a basement. When I try to remember what the cultists looked like, I couldn't. I soon had to come to terms with the fact that it was all a dream. Bill and Jess never existed. There was no cult. And I didn't kill a monster. I was back to being a nobody. The only good thing to come out of this was that the restaurant was investigated and it was found out that Kyle had been embezzling funds. He was arrested and the owners said I could come back to work once I was better. Of course now, I had to pay off my new vehicle and my medical bills.   



I learned a valuable lesson from this experience. No matter how great the story. How grand the fantasy. Or how vivid the dream. At the end of the day, I must always wake up.

I love slow mornings with coffee and cafes, wandering cute streets, checking out local shops (especially handmade goods, pottery, books), and being near a park or river for a nice walk. Not into luxury shopping or super commercial areas.

Here are my top picks so far: 

- Kichijoji – love the park and neighborhood vibes

- Jimbocho – books + retro cafes + cats sound amazing

- Nakameguro – riverside walks and design shops

- Yanaka – quiet, traditional, and charming. 

I also considered Koenji and Shimokitazawa. I’m feeling overwhelmed bc they all look so interesting and unique.

If you’ve been to any of these, which would you choose for a cozy, artsy, walkable experience? Or would it make sense to split the stay between two? 

For reference my husband and I are in our early 40’s and will be traveling with our 9 year old daughter who loves art and anything kawaii. We’re flying in to Haneda and will also be visiting Kiso Valley, Kyoto and Kurashiki over 10 days. 

Any and all suggestions welcome. Thank you so much for your help! 🩷

1mf7gwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoTravel/comments/1mf7gwy/need_help_finding_this_shop/,Need help finding this shop,"I went to Ginza about a week ago and stumbled across this amazing clothing store with the nicest owner and amazing fabric. I bought a pair of pants there and when I came home my sister loved them too so, I'm trying to find the name of the store, phone number, website... pretty much any info so I can try to get another pair. It's right next door to Unagi Tomimatsu ( Japan, 〒104-0061 Tokyo, Chuo City, Ginza, 3 Chome−13−2 登栄東銀座ビル 1Ｆ).

If you are in the area when you visit, I highly recommend checking it out. The owner only speaks Japanese but had a translator that he used to talk with my boyfriend and I. He is genuinely super kind and welcoming, we were talking to him the whole time we were there. He said that the shop has been there for for 100+ years (i can't remember exactly), he makes some of the clothes himself and the rest are made with Japanese fabric. He told us that making Japanese fabric is pretty difficult and the workers that make it are getting to be too old and is kind of a dying art unfortunately.

1mf7g1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mf7g1i/misfortune_of_a_pizza_guy/,Misfortune of a pizza guy,"If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be “nobody”. I blend into the background so well, most of my classmates from high school don't even remember me. My name is John. At least it's what I go by. Nobody gets my actual first name right. I am a twenty three year old guy who still lives at home. My deadbeat father walked out when I was two and I was raised by my mother. I barely graduated high school. I don't know how I didn't have to repeat any years. I've given up on the thought of ever having a girlfriend. Now, I deliver pizzas. Still not knowing what I want to do with the rest of my life. The only escape I have from reality is stories. On what few breaks I had, I would read short stories on my phone. I would listen to conspiracy podcasts while I drove. Most of the time, I would imagine myself in these stories. Just to feel like I was important for once in my life. 



I was driving on the highway one night to my next delivery. It was just another night of a sixteen hour shift, podcasts, and praying that my shit box of a car wouldn't break down. My manager Kyle, who knew that I was already on my third day this week of working this long, caught me as I was about to punch out. He said since I was still technically on the clock, I had to take this last delivery. Without overtime pay mind you. I tried to imagine a wendigo busting down the front door and consuming him. But, for the thousandth time, nothing happened and I was in my car on my way to the delivery.   



The smell of the pizza on my passenger seat was making my mouth water. I had to mentally smack myself and refrain from sneaking a slice and blaming it on the kitchen. The podcast I was listening to was talking about some banned books and the impact of government overreach. I imagined myself smuggling books into the U.S. under the nose of federal agents. I felt my head starting to bob. I was so tired. Every so often, I would hit a pot hole that would snap me awake and I would listen to make sure that nothing was wrong with the car. I was really trying to save up for a new one. Or, at least, one that didn't have more rust and duct tape than anything else. I was also paying rent to my mother while I still lived with her. She insisted that I didn't have to, but I needed to do something. With her working as a nurse and my long hours, we barely saw each other anyway. I felt my eye lids get heavy. Maybe I could pull over for a minute and get a micro nap. No. I needed to get this done so I could go home. Despite my efforts, I closed my eyes for a brief moment. I looked up and saw headlights coming toward me. I grabbed the wheel and tried to steer out of the way. But I was too late. I heard the crunch of metal as I hit the oncoming vehicle. I looked past my steering wheel and saw a blur as someone got out of the back seat and ran into the woods. Before I could do anything else, everything faded to black. 



The next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital room. It was the hospital my mom worked at. A nurse came in. “Oh good. You're awake.” I looked around. “What happened?” She walked over and looked at my chart. “You were in an accident. Another car swerved into your lane and hit you head on. It's a miracle you only had a minor concussion.” I sat up and examined myself. I didn't appear to have any injuries aside from a small bump on my forehead. Another nurse came in holding a bundle of my clothes. She set them on a chair and left. “Well,” said the first nurse. I didn't see a name tag. “Once you get dressed, you are free to go. Just come in if you have any questions or have any pain.” I thanked her and she left. After putting on my clothes, I left the room I was in and began walking down the familiar halls toward the exit. It was surprisingly quiet today. I passed the front desk and the receptionist nodded to me as I stepped out into the cool night air. I looked at my wrist out of habit to see the time. But my watch was gone.  Must have been ripped off in the accident. I pulled out my phone. The screen was completely shattered. Signing to myself, I began walking home. Luckily for me, it was only a couple of blocks away. The town I lived in wasn't very big. I guessed that I wouldn't have a job starting tomorrow. I knew that Kyle was the kind of guy to care more about the failed delivery than my well being. But, there was nothing I could do about it. The silence of the night was deafening. The only sound I could hear was the wind rustling the trees dotting the side walks. Normally I would put an earbud in and turn on some music when I walked. But since I couldn't do that, I decided to let my imagination run wild. I imagined myself fighting against a horde of zombies. Keeping the oncoming swarm at bay with machine guns and molotov cocktails.  



I was about half way home when I heard footsteps behind me. Snapping back to reality, I looked back and saw someone walking with their hands in their pockets and a hood concealing their face. I just shrugged to myself and continued walking. Even if it was a mugger, it wasn't like I had anything valuable on me worth stealing. It was then that I heard the sound of a vehicle approaching from behind. It passed me and parked along the sidewalk. Glancing around, I realized that there weren't any other cars driving by. I moved to the other side of the sidewalk to give the vehicle a wide berth. Once I was closer, I saw that it was a blacked out Suburban. The back passenger door opened. I heard the footsteps speed up behind me and I felt myself being shoved into the back seat. As soon as the door closed, a gag was put into my mouth and a hood was placed over my head. 



They drove for what felt like an hour in silence. Trying to guess where we were going blindfolded was way harder than the movies made it look. The driver pulled to a stop and I was dragged out of the SUV. I tried to go limp, but it was no use. The two people carrying didn't even slow down. I felt them slam me into a chair and zip ties put on my wrists. The hood was ripped off and I squinted, waiting for my eyes to adjust. Looking around, I didn't know where I was. My guess was that it was one of the empty warehouses at the edge of town. All around us work lights were set up, all facing toward me. There were three people standing in front of me. All of them were dressed in black with their faces hidden under  their hoods. The one in the middle approached me. Kneeling down, I could make out the faint smell of cigarettes. “Where’s the lamb?” He asked. I just stared at him. “Huh?” The man sighed in frustration. “The girl! Where is she?” I just shook my head in confusion. “I- I don't know what you’re talking about.” I could see the man's jaw clenching. He stood up and reached into his pocket. At first I couldn't tell what he had pulled out, but I immediately recognized the shape of a bowie knife. “Guess we’ll have to do this the hard way.” He said as he moved closer. Before I could protest, I heard a muffled thump as the left side of the man's head erupted in a shower of red and white chunks. The other two tried to react, but another two thumps sounded and they were on the floor laying in growing pools of blood. I just stared at the bodies in disbelief. After a moment, there was the sound of footsteps approaching from my left. Out of the darkness, another man appeared. This one was carrying a rifle. He stopped a few feet away and stared at me. “Are you here to help me or kill me?” I asked after a painfully long moment of silence. The man walked over and picked up the dead man's knife. I closed my eyes and waited for him to stab me. Instead, he cut the zip ties holding my wrists in place. I felt the circulation return to my hands. I looked up at him. His face was covered by a balaclava. “Come with me,” he said, walking away in the direction he came from. I stood up and looked at the bodies on the ground. I didn't know what was going on, but at that moment, the man with the rifle seemed like a safer bet. 



The man led me to a pickup parked just outside the warehouse gate. After hopping in, he turned to me. “What did they ask you?” I stared at him for a moment. My mouth dry. He pulled off the balaclava revealing his face. I didn't recognize him. Being in a town as small as mine, you would have seen everybody at least once. He had short black hair with hints of grey along the edges. His blue eyes were bright and piercing as he waited for my response. “Um. They wanted to know where a girl was.” He nodded slowly. “And?” “They did say something about a lamb. But that was it.” He just turned and started the engine. We rode for several minutes in silence. I kept glancing at him waiting for some explanation as to what was going on, but he kept quiet. My mind was racing. I was just in a car accident and walking home from the hospital. Why was I kidnapped and questioned about a girl? Once my mind slowed down and I realized that trying to figure it out in my head was going to get me nowhere, I asked. “So. Who are you? And what's going on?” The man finally looked at me. “Call me Bill.” He looked back at the road. “Whats going on?” I asked again. Bill made a sharp turn and we were in an alleyway between the deli and laundry mat. After looking around again, Bill finally looked at me. “Those people are after my niece. The van you were in an accident with was transporting her. But she escaped after you crashed.” I thought back to the accident. I did see someone get out of the van and run into the woods before I blacked out. “Now, they think you helped her escape and know where she is.” Bill continued. I stared at him for a long moment. “Who are they exactly?” There was a flash of headlight behind us as a car drove past the alley. Bill just shook his head. “Later.” He pulled out and we continued to whatever destination he had in mind. I reached for my phone again to call someone. But I remembered that it was shattered. I didn't even know who I would call in this situation. The police, my mother? All I knew was that I just got caught up in something I was not ready for. “Where are we going?” I asked. We had driven all around in what seemed like random directions before he pulled onto a back road leading out of town. “I have a cabin not too far from here. If there's one safe place she might have gone, it would be there.”                    



We drove for another several miles before turning onto a dirt road leading us deeper into the woods. Looking out, the moonlight cast eerie shadows through the trees. If I wasn't worried about my life at that moment, I would be imagining some monsters lurking in those shadows waiting for a chance to strike. I lurched forward as Bill came to a stop in front of the cabin. It wasn't much to look at. Just a simple log cabin with moss growing on the side of it. I guessed that it was likely used as a hunting shack in the fall. I hopped out of the truck and approached it. Bill was grabbing something out of the back seat. I reached for the knob when the door flew open and I was face to face with a girl. I guessed that she was in her early twenties. She had long dirty blond hair tied into a pony tail. She had a pale complexion with freckles dotting her face and deep emerald eyes. She was wearing torn jeans and a grey hoodie. Honestly, she was probably one of the most beautiful girls I’ve met. Especially in this town. The only thing I found unattractive about her was the pistol she had pointed at my chest. I swallowed hard and raised my hands slowly. “Um. Friendly?” I said cautiously. She glanced behind me and lowered the gun. “Uncle!” Bill had come up behind me carrying a rifle case and two backpacks. The girl shoved past me and hugged Bill. “Are you alright?” He asked, patting her on the back with the hand holding the case. She pulled back and nodded. She looked back at me. “Whose he?” She asked. “Um. I’m John.” I stammered. Bill looked back down the driveway. “Lets head inside.” I turned and entered the cabin. The main area had a couch, coffee table, bear skin rug, and several deer heads mounted on the walls. By one corner, there was a wood stove and a small dining room table with two chairs. To the right, there were two doors. One led to a bedroom and the other was a small bathroom. I walked over and sat on one of the wooden chairs. The girl sat on the couch as Bill set the packs next to the stove. I looked between the two. “What now?” I asked. Bill rummaged through one of the packs and pulled out two items. He tossed one to me and one to the girl. “You two wait here. I’m going to try and take care of this mess.” I looked down at what he tossed at me. It was an MRE. “There are water bottles in the packs.” He turned to the girl. “Notify me if anything happens.” He said, handing her a cell phone. “Be careful,” she said. Bill nodded and left. 



After we could no longer hear the truck, we just sat there in silence for a while in awkward silence. “So,” I said. “I don't think I caught your name.” She set the pistol on the coffee table and opened her MRE. “It's Jess.” I nodded as she pulled out a pack of Skittles. I wasn't feeling all that hungry. “Whats your story?” I asked. “Oh, you know.” She said, getting up and fishing a water bottle from one of the packs. “My parents were part of a cult. They had me. And now the cult wants to sacrifice me to their god for world peace or some bullshit like that. You?” I just stared at her dumbly. I couldn't tell if she was being serious. “Um. I was just delivering a pizza.” I said. She snorted and went back to eating her food. “You were the one that ran into us?” She asked after a minute. I nodded. “Sorry about your car.” I just shrugged. “I’ll deal with that when this is over.” For the next couple of hours we made small talk. Mostly about movies and our hobbies. Or, more like her hobbies. I didn't have many outside of reading and listening to stories. But she did find some of the ones I told interesting. At least, I hope she did. Eventually, Jess fell asleep. I did my best to stay awake and listen for Bill to return. I thought about what Jess said. Did I really stumble into some cult dispute? If so, what was I supposed to do about it? Just wait till Bill dealt with it? After trying to come to terms with my situation, I heard the sound of a vehicle pulling up. I didn't want to wake Jess, so I quietly stepped out the front door. I figured Bill might need help with something. After stepping out, I felt like something was wrong. Bill didn't shut the engine off. The headlights were pointing toward the cabin, so I couldn't see. I tried to block the light with my hand while my eyes adjusted, I realized that it wasn't Bill's pickup. The black SUV pulled up and the doors opened. Before I could do anything, I felt something hit me hard in the back of the head. Next thing I knew, I was on the ground. I heard the sounds of gun shots and Jess screaming. Through my blurring vision, I could see two people dragging a squirming Jess out of the cabin and into the vehicle. I heard the doors shut and the crunching of gravel before everything faded to black. 



I awoke to the feeling of cold water being splashed on my face. I shook my head as my vision returned. I was met with a very agitated Bill standing over me. Looking around, I was sitting on the couch. There were spots of blood on the floor alongside spent pistol casings. “What happened?!” Bill yelled. I was still a little dizzy. “They showed up and took her.” I said. Bill turned and flipped the table following a trail of swearing that would make a sailor blush. After a minute, he calmed down and looked at me. “Come with me,” he said. I stood up, still a little disoriented. I followed him out of the cabin and to the back of his truck. The bed had one of those toppers on it. Bill opened the back and I was shocked to see an unconscious man tied and gagged laying there. “Help me get him inside.” Not knowing what else to do, I complied. We worked together and dragged the man inside. We placed one of the chairs in the middle of the room and tied him to it. I noticed that he had a tourniquet wrapped around one of his legs just above some bloody gauze covering what looked like a bullet wound. I looked at Bill with a questioning look. He just shrugged. “What? He was running.” Bill walked over to the packs and pulled out another bottle of water. He splashed our captive and followed with a few hard slaps to wake him up. The man stirred and shook his head. Once he focused on Bill, he tried to break free on his restraints. Realizing his resistance was useless, he looked between me and Bill. Bill took out the gag. “Where did they take her?” The man just laughed. “You can't stop what we are doing.” I saw Bill grit his teeth. He reached behind him and pulled out a revolver and pointed at the man. He just smiled. “You think you can scare me wi-” Bill cocked the hammer. “Alright alright.” The man hung his head. “The old bowling alley at the edge of town. The ritual is going to take place in the basement.” Damn. That was easy. Bill lowered the hammer. Raising his hand, Bill struck the man in the temple with the grip of the pistol, knocking him unconscious again. After putting the gag back in his mouth, Bill walked over to the rifle case he brought in earlier. I was still just standing there, stunned by the interaction. “Hey!” Bill yelled, snapping me out of my stupor. He tossed me a rifle. It was an AR 15 with a red dot sight. “You know how to use it?” He asked. I nodded and he pulled out more equipment. I didn't have the heart to tell him that the only experience I had with guns was movies and Call of Duty. But it couldn't be that hard. Just point and click. He handed me two magazines for the rifle and a pistol in a holster. After I shoved the mags into my pocket and clipped the holster to my belt, we left the cabin and hopped into the truck. I looked at Bill. “Are we just going to leave that guy here?” He started the engine and began driving. “He’s not going anywhere. And nobody’s going to hear him out here. Besides, if he is wrong, I’m going to need to question him some more.” We peeled onto the back road and made our way back to town. 



After we entered the town's edge, I broke the silence. “So, what is going on exactly?” Bill sighed. “My idiot of a brother joined a cult some years back. Said it gave him purpose. He met a woman there and they had Jess. The cult believes that if they sacrifice a child born from two of their members, they can summon their god and bring a new utopia.” I stared at him. I had thought that Jess was just messing with me. “So, you want to save her and prevent the ritual from happening?” He looked at me as though I just said the stupidest thing ever. “No. Their religion is bullshit. I want to keep a bunch of wannabe coolaid drinkers from killing my niece.” I just nodded and shut my mouth for the rest of the drive. We pulled into the parking lot of the bowling alley and climbed out. “Whats the plan?” I asked. Bill grabbed his rifle out of the back seat and chambered a round. “Go in quietly and shoot anyone that isn't Jess.” He started walking to the building. I looked back at the truck. The keys were still in the ignition. I could drive away. I could try to get the cops. But what was I going to tell them? Hey, two people I just met are fighting a cult and one of them is about to be sacrificed to a false god. Not likely they would believe me. Even if they did, it would be too late. I just shook my head and began following Bill.



 Instead of going in the front door, we maneuvered to the back. Parked by the rear exit, were three vehicles. One of them was the same SUV that took Jess. Bill moved forward and opened the door. We waited for a moment and listened. Nothing. We quietly pushed our way in and began looking for a stairway to the basement. I wasn't much for any kind of sports, so the only time I ever came here was in elementary school for an after class activity. After a few minutes of sweeping, we finally found a door labeled “basement”. Bill looked to me with an anticipating expression. I raised my rifle toward the door and nodded. He grabbed the door knob and slowly opened it. We stood there, our rifles aimed at the darkness. We could hear the faint sounds of chanting coming from the bottom of the stairwell. “Shit,” Bill hissed. “They’re starting.” He entered the doorway and I followed close after. We moved quietly until we reached the bottom. This was clearly where the excess equipment was stored. There were boxes of spare pins and bowling balls. Near the far end of the basement, we could see five individuals dressed in black cloaks standing around a stone altar. How they got that down there I wasn't sure. There were two cultists standing on either side and one at the center. With my eyes adjusted to the low light, I could make out the form of Jess laying on the altar. She was restrained and clearly struggling to escape. The chanting died down and the cultist in the middle raised his hand to the ceiling as another one pulled out a long black dagger from their cloak. As they raised it, me and Bill rushed out and began firing at the group. Bill took out the two on the left as I fired at the ones on the right. Even with my lack of experience, the two went down without issue. The dagger clattered to the floor next to the altar. Once the four were down, we aimed at the remaining cultists in the center. He looked at us with a look of disdain. “You dare interrupt our rit-” His words were cut off as we both unloaded into him. His body slumped against the altar. I ran up as Bill searched the basement for others that might have been hiding. Jess’ hands were bound behind her back and duct tape covering her mouth. I grabbed the dagger at my feet and cut the zip ties freeing her. As soon as she was free, she wrapped her arms around me and held me tight. Not knowing what else to do, I just patted her on the back. “Thank you,” she said, tears in her eyes. Bill came up behind us. “We should get going.” We both nodded. 



As we began walking to the stairs, I felt a chill run down my spine. I looked back to the last cultist and saw his blood pooling around him on the altar. I realized that the liquid was moving. It was beginning to form some sort of symbol I didn't recognize. As soon as it did, A black smoke began emanating from it as runes on the altar began to pulse with a deep purple light. Through the black smoke, I  began to see black and oily tendrils begin to emerge. We jumped back toward Bill as more of this thing became visible. It was massive. Filling up the whole ritual area. Its skin was black and glossy. There were several mouths all along the round bulbous body. Those tendrils I had seen earlier had begun wrapping around the bodies of the dead cultists and it was beginning to eat them. The bodies were lowered into the multiple mouths and the squishing and crunching sounds that followed made bile rise to my throat. After a moment, I saw Bill shake his head and begin firing at the creature. That snapped me to my senses and I followed suit. Even Jess took the pistol from Bill's holster and began firing. However, the thing didn't even seem to notice the bullets hitting it. Too focused on its meal. I happened to glance down and saw the black dagger laying on the floor where I had dropped it. The tendrils seemed to be avoiding it. I looked to Bill, “cover me.” Before he could say anything, I ran forward emptying the last magazine for the rifle. As I reached the altar, one of the tendrils wrapped around my right leg and I felt gravity shift as I was lifted into the air. The now empty rifle fell out of my hands. I drew the pistol and began firing wildly at the thing. Seeming more irritated than hurt, it slammed me against the ground, knocking the wind out of me. I looked to my right. The dagger. I managed to grab it just as I was once again in the air. The tendril began squeezing harder and I felt something crack in my leg. I let out a scream of pain and anger. The thing seemed amused at that. I reached up and slashed at the tendril. The blade cut through the flesh with ease as a spray of black fluid soaked my pant leg. The thing let out a shriek as it released me. I fell to the ground and landed hard on my left arm. I felt something crack. The adrenalin pumping through me was enough to make me ignore the pain and stand. With the dagger in my other hand, I bolted forward and began slashing at the things flesh. It let out more shrieks of pain the more I hacked at it. Eventually it lay still. I was covered in the things black viscous blood. I stood there. Amazed. I had actually killed a monster. Not in my imagination, but for real. I limped toward the others who were staring at me with amazement. The black smoke returned and the body of the thing was beginning to disappear into it. Jess and Bill each took one of my arms and helped me up the stairs. 



Once we were outside I asked Bill, “what now?” He chuckled and shook his head. “Well. These weren't the only members of this cult. If what we saw down there is really what they are trying to summon, we need to do something about it.” I nodded. My throat was feeling a bit dry. “Let's do it.” I said. They both grinned and we walked to the truck. Beep. I looked around. “Did you hear that?” I asked. They both turned to me. Beep. “Hear what?” Jess asked. I stopped and listened. Beep. “That!” They looked at each other and shrugged. Beep. I felt a pounding in my head. Beep. My vision began to blur. “Are you ok John?” Jess asked. Beep. I closed my eyes and shook my head. Beep. I forced my eyes open. I was staring at a white ceiling. I couldn't move. Beep. I looked to my right and could just make out the heartbeat monitor. Looking to my left I could see my mom asleep on one of the visitors chairs. I tried to speak, but there were tubes in my mouth. All I managed to get out was a grunt. This was enough to wake mom up. She jumped up and ran over to me. She was still wearing her scrubs. “John! Thank God.” She pushed the call button and ran to the door. “Doctor! He’s awake.” I didn't know what was going on. After a minute, a doctor came in. “John. Can you hear me?” I nodded slowly. “Good. You were in an accident and have been unconscious for the past week.” I stared at him. Unable to speak. That couldn't be right. I was just with Bill and Jess at the bowling alley. My accident happened yesterday. And I was fine. After a bit, they took the tubes out of my mouth. “Where’s Jess?” I managed to croak out. My throat was dry as hell. My mom looked at me confused. “Who is Jess?” I sat up. My right leg and left arm were in casts. 



After a while, I was informed that I had fallen asleep behind the wheel when I was delivering that last pizza. I had gone off the road and slammed into a tree. A passing car had noticed me and I was brought to the hospital. I tried to ask about Bill and Jess. But nobody knew who I was talking about. After I was released, I tried to drive myself out to Bill's cabin. But no matter which way I went, I couldn't find the back road to his driveway. I even went to the bowling alley and talked to the owner. He told me the place didn't have a basement. When I try to remember what the cultists looked like, I couldn't. I soon had to come to terms with the fact that it was all a dream. Bill and Jess never existed. There was no cult. And I didn't kill a monster. I was back to being a nobody. The only good thing to come out of this was that the restaurant was investigated and it was found out that Kyle had been embezzling funds. He was arrested and the owners said I could come back to work once I was better. Of course now, I had to pay off my new vehicle and my medical bills.   



I learned a valuable lesson from this experience. No matter how great the story. How grand the fantasy. Or how vivid the dream. At the end of the day, I must always wake up.

I wonder how many of these people actually shoot their shot on the regular. In general, people are just not approaching each other enough nowadays. Women especially have been taught to let men approach them first. The only surefire way to get a date is to start talking to people, and that is where confidence comes into play.

I'm not talking about walking up with a sleazy pickup line, I'm talking about striking up a conversation with a compliment or something witty and just seeing where things go. If you click, ask for a phone number and get coffee later. If they're not interested, that's fine! Every individual has a type- usually a quite narrow one. So if it didn't work out, don't take it personally. Sow enough seeds and you'll find someone who is your type, and likes you back. (Just learn to spot awkward laughter, and don't mistake it for a green flag. Banter is usually your go sign instead.)

Most of attractiveness is presentation and especially CONFIDENCE. I've seen fat people and people with bad skin and whatever else you're insecure about who were smoking hot. The trick is a haircut and clothes that suit you, and again, CONFIDENCE. Nobody will date you if you treat yourself and speak about yourself like an undateable loser. Nothing is a bigger turn off than someone who's always self-deprecating.  
  
Remind yourself of your best qualities to build confidence.  If you really don't like yourself, find a part of yourself you're at least okay with and remind yourself of it every day until you find more things to like. You don't need a persona, you only need to be the best version of yourself. There's something positive about you, no matter who you are. Exemplify that.

In addition to kindness towards yourself, confidence must be balanced with genuine kindness towards the people around you. Do not be kind to receive things like dates, be kind by default because it feels good or because you know it's beneficial to make other people feel good. Confidence without kindness is just being a douche.

I was a complete loser in highschool, but a wardrobe change, depression treatment, and working hard to build confidence made me a bizarrely popular guy. I'm dating chicks and dudes who feel ""too pretty/handsome"" for me because I decided to shoot my shot.

And one final note... don't let dating apps determine your dateability. I get loads of play in real life and no play on dating apps. Talk to people irl instead! The risk of social anxiety comes with high rewards!

1mf7dcn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mf7dcn,Kann,"tl;dr the food was absolutely immaculate from start to finish; the service…😕; my server was just not very good nor was he attentive. Would I go back again and again and again given the chance? Fuck yes. 

- The Creole smoked duck: apparently takes 2 days total to make and you can tell how much work went into the dish. The duck itself was tender, luscious and fatty but the generous spices and the delectable sauce made it eat so light. Not only that, I felt satisfied with how much duck I got. It’s the most expensive entree but for me, it’s worth every cent.

- Lightly seared Hiramasa with that amazingly delicious coconut milk vinaigrette: Once again, this was an app but it felt like a very complete dish and once again it was spicy—as a spicy lover this was heavenly for me

- Crispy Eggplants side: idk why I got this—probably cuz I was several beers deep from a small brewery hop—but I don’t regret it. The eggplant was cubed and fried so perfectly that you’d mistake it for a piece of fried tofu. When you bite into those crispy cubes of deliciousness, you get that creamy eggplant goodness and with the spicy sauce drizzled it was a veggie lover dream 

- the Peach Tartlette- as a simple Southeast Asian person, when I see jackfruit on the menu, I get it. And I never knew how well peach and jackfruit went so well with each other. Not too sweet and very nice end to the dinner.

- last but certainly not least, Kann coffee—spiced perfectly and so so so fragrant. And as a lactose intolerant person who insists on eating dairy anyway, I appreciate the coconut cream as the creamer 

Overall, I’m so blown away by the meal and because you can tell how much thought and work went into every dish, you appreciate “fancy” meals like this. I feel so grateful to have had the chance to try this especially as like the finishing button to my road trip vacation. Thank you Gregory and the team for a wonderful meal!

**Hello.**

**Yeah, it’s me. Sexy Bouldur. Or Muscle Man, depending on which cursed coffee mug Raven's got lying around this week.**

**Man,you should’ve seen Raven when she came back. She looked proud like she just hit number one on a music chart and exorcised her way through a live stage. We got to eat some real food too. Actual food. Not ghost-scream seasoned leftovers. I’m telling you, it was a whole vibe. Real peaceful. The kind of peaceful that makes you side-eye the forks in case they’re cursed.**

**Honestly, I was kinda shocked we weren’t getting murdered.**

**But then again, I remembered — slashers love the theater of it. The quiet before the guts and glitter. They love playing their little roles.**

**So hey, if you’re just tuning in — or if you’re one of those weirdos who reads horror forums for bedtime stories — I’m the mortal in this whole mess. The dude with a heartbeat and apparently, the youngest.**

**Which is wild, ‘cause I’m pushing thirty. Maybe past it. I can rent a car and everything. But compared to a necromancer K-pop queen, a dryad elf of science, and some mythos-born wildcard? I’m the puppy in the pack.**

**I still remember being surprised when Raven took me out on a date and paid for everything. I looked at her and said, ""You know I’m older than you, right?"" She just laughed — that kind of laugh that makes you feel like she knows more than time itself — and said, ""You’re kind of younger than me, actually. I only date guys in their thirties.""**

**Also, for you lore nerds — yeah, I’m the uncle of Hex-One and Hex-Two. My brother got hitched to a goblin from the Chaos Realms and now I’ve got two hyper-cursed gremlins calling me Uncle B. No, I don’t know how goblin marriage contracts work. No, I’m not asking. And yes, they can bench press me with one hand.**

**As for how I got into this gig? No epic backstory. No curse. Just plain old 90s indecision.**

**It was either follow the family into the military like everyone else, or go into something equally classic like construction, security, mall cop duty, mechanic school, or even trying to become a stuntman — which was way cooler in theory. Heck, IT help desk jobs were starting to blow up too. But nah.**

**I signed up with the Hasher Network instead. And honestly, I’m glad I did — especially with all the tech upgrades we’ve got now. Hunting down a local slasher back then was not as easy as you'd think. No drone support, no cursed data trackers, just you, your boots, and maybe a screaming walkie-talkie that shorted out around blood magic.**

**Back in the day, they called it The Painline Division. Yeah, it sounds dramatic, but that was the 90s for you. Everything had spiked logos and fake blood aesthetics. We had VHS training videos, combat boots with runes, and the world’s worst gym playlist.**

**For us mortals, though, the training was different. People always assumed we’d just be used as bait — and yeah, they weren’t totally wrong. But because of that, they had to enhance our bodies somehow. Just in case someone like Nicky or Vicky couldn’t swoop in to save the day. So we got special workouts, weird injections, resistance training that made boot camp look like spa day, and full-on magical upgrades. We had to be fast, durable, and at least a little scary-looking to throw off supernatural predators.**

**Anyway, I’m walking around the halls on the second day, trying to activate Rule Two somehow. Unlike the rest of them, I don’t need tattoos or special gear to draw a slasher in. I’m mortal. That’s enough.**

**Slashers — if we’re being real — they always go for people like me. The ones who look like they’re not used to the supernatural. It’s a horror trope for a reason. Whether it’s the guy who wanders off to find cell signal, or the girl who says she’ll be right back, it’s always someone like us. The uninitiated. The human bait.**

**And maybe that’s what makes Rule Two dangerous. Because I look like I don’t belong here. But I do. And I’ve got more than enough rage to play their game.**

**Though... I started to feel it. That prickling sensation, crawling between my shoulder blades like a thought I couldn't finish. Something was following me. Not loud. Not clumsy. Just there — clinging to the air like a shadow that hadn’t figured out how to cast itself.**

**I spun and slammed my back against the wall, hoping whatever it was might lose grip if I moved fast enough. But nothing fell. Nothing moved. The hallway stretched out ahead of me, silent and sick with that old motel perfume — mildew and floral soap.**

**I almost pulled out my music device. Maybe it’d trigger something. But we already played that card in Rule One. Would they fall for it again? Or would it just make me easier to follow — like putting on a spotlight and dancing into the trap myself?**

**So I started thinking. What horror trope would Rule Two cling to in this setting? You know the types — the slumber party bloodbath, the poolside massacre, the rave gone wrong, the birthday party with a cursed clown invite. Rule Two slashers thrive on that kind of scene. Social setups. Laughter. Celebration. Something to ruin.**

**And then it hit me. We’re in a resort. You want to trigger that energy? You throw a party. Honestly? I kinda hoped this slasher would turn out to be a mermaid or some kind of succubus. I’ve got a growing collection and I’m just one wing short… or a fish tail, if the gods are listening.**

**So, I took out my phone and started scrolling through the hotel’s map. That’s when I saw it — an arcade room and an event listed as 'Party of Games.'**

**Now, I know what you’re thinking: why are the slashers making it so easy for us? First of all, I don’t know about you, but some slashers prefer being found over playing hide-and-seek. And second? You’re reading about a resort that kills lovers for sport — of course they’ve got an active schedule. An itinerary of bloodshed. It’s all part of the experience.**

**So, I headed toward the arcade room, walking down the hallway expecting a cheap jumpscare or some spooky background whispering. Instead? Mascots. Puppets. Just… standing there. I flinched, not gonna lie. At that point, a proper jumpscare might’ve been polite.**

**It brought back memories — back when I did gigs for arcades like Ruck Tesses and other spots. One of the Hasher duties back then? Making sure there weren’t any child-murdering psychos lurking around the ball pits. You’d be surprised — that late ’90s to early 2000s spike in kid injuries wasn’t just from jungle gyms. Slashers knew how to sneak in.**

**Hashers had to do PSAs. We were those people going, ""Hey, where are your kids? No, seriously,** ***where*****?""**

**As for the folks who tried to harm kids? We didn’t forget. We put them on an island — yeah, a real one — where the same kids they once hurt, all grown up and trained by us, could hunt them down. It takes real strength, you know? When those kids choose to let their abusers live. But when they don’t — well, us seniors step in and finish the job.**

**Some of those sickos only ever targeted children. The worst kind, I mean. The ones who did it for reasons that make your skin crawl.**

**Seeing Little Timmy finally take out Jimmy the Butcher? That’s the kind of beautiful no therapy can give. That program helped reduce the number of kids who grew up mimicking the monsters who hurt them. Turns out justice with a machete — and a little guidance — does wonders for the psyche.**

**Child slashers, though... those are a different breed. I’ve had to put down a few in my time. It’s not easy. But if some little bastard knows better and still murders the girl who turned him down? Or the boy who liked someone else? Then yeah, Samantha — it’s your time to go.**

**And I’m bringing this up because slashers who use arcades? They usually fall into one of those two categories. Either predators who target kids — or kids who turned into predators. That’s what I’m walking into. And I’ve got my eye out.**

**When an adult Hasher handles a kid slasher — not one of the junior ranks — that’s serious. We don’t dump everything on the kids. We step up. Nicky always says she keeps things 18+ with her crew to keep the heavy stuff off younger shoulders. We've got all ages in the fight, sure — even schools with some of the best security around. College? Expensive as hell. Unless you're like Hex-One and Hex-Two — then it’s combat training and a diploma, no bill. I am still wondering why they went field route and not sit in the office like everyone else in those colleges.**

**So yeah, I’m glad this is a catch-them-all order and not a kill-on-sight. Kill orders suck, man. If I had to go that route… well, I would. For the greater good. But I won’t pretend it doesn’t sting. Still, here’s the kicker — they pay five times as much when you’re taking down kid slashers. I know, it's messed up. But that’s how the orders justify it. Kid slashers are rare, dangerous, and leave scars that don’t heal easy. The payout is dirty, but it spends. And honestly? Most of us just cash it quietly and try not to puke while looking at the receipt.**

**Anyway, I finally got to the arcade and there it was — someone just** ***demolishing*** **the whack-a-mole machine like it owed them child support. From behind, they looked like a little girl in clown makeup — small, twitchy, with big pigtails bouncing as they swung the mallet. My stomach sank faster than a rigged claw game.**

**Then they turned around.**

**I almost cheered. It was some weird little old dude in a frilly clown dress with blush caked on like expired frosting. The fake high-pitched kid voice was disturbingly good, like Saturday morning cartoon meets horror-core. But I’ve seen better makeup at half-priced cosplay cons. Still, I’d take a wrinkly goblin in ruffles over a demonic Girl Scout any day.**

**""Dude, I am so happy it’s you,"" I said, throwing my hands up like we were old high school buddies.**

**The slasher blinked, genuinely confused. ""You’re happy to see me? That’s a first.""**

**I facepalmed. I was genuinely relieved not to be staring down some cursed adult slasher in a child’s body. This guy? He actually** ***looked*** **like an old man—makeup, wrinkles, the whole deal. Thank the peach realms for that.**

**You know that horror trope, right? Where something** ***looks*** **like a kid but isn’t? Japan loves that stuff. Creepy children, haunted dolls, cursed third-graders with thousand-yard stares. My niece and nephew are way into anime and manga, and as their uncle, I made the mistake of reading a few of their recs. I still have regrets.**

**It’s not even all bad, but it’s a real pattern. Like, the Japan branch of the Hashers stays booked. Every time some middle school ghost turns out to be a 300-year-old vengeance spirit who thinks Pokémon battles should end in blood, guess who gets the call?**

**“Sorry,” I told him with a casual shrug, “I was just really hoping it wasn’t a kid slasher. But hey—what’s your gimmick? Classic arcade death match? Haunted joystick possession? Maybe a casual round of ‘Guess Which Game is Cursed’ before you try to flambe me?”**

**He let out a long sigh. ""I told the others we should’ve done a more** ***thorough*** **magical background check on your team. But nooo, 'let's have some fun,' they said.""**

**Probably why they haven’t been caught yet either. When you're just out here playing slasher games and not filing magical paperwork, you tend to slip through the cracks. Which means, yeah, the Sonsters are probably gonna have to start doing missing person reports again. They're the ones who track all the souls — and if you start losing track of soul signatures? That’s when protocol turns into a damn audit.**

**That’s when I noticed a flicker behind me—just a shimmer at first, like heat rippling off pavement. My instincts didn’t just kick in—they exploded. I spun fast, yanking a joystick clean out of a busted cabinet with a crack so loud it echoed like a thunderclap in a tin can alley.**

**Then came the flame. A jet of fire blasted from the shadows, hissing past my shoulder like a personal hate note from Satan himself. I dropped to the floor, rolled sideways, and came up crouched behind a skee-ball ramp, joystick at the ready. The heat had barely missed me—close enough to make the back of my jacket bubble. The air was now thick with the smell of burning plastic, scorched ozone, and something suspiciously like flaming bubblegum.**

**I wasn’t just dodging fire—I was dodging humiliation. Getting toasted in a retro arcade by a clown grandpa? Nah. Not on my watch.**

**I flipped the joystick in my hand like a dagger, testing the weight, heart racing.**

**Then, something flickered in the corner of my vision. A CRT monitor flicked on—one I** ***swear*** **was unplugged—and the slasher’s face warped onto the old Atra game screen.**

**""You can’t catch me,"" his grainy voice crackled, eyes glitching like corrupted pixels. ""Take out that Atra, and you might never catch me. This model doesn’t even need cords. And you need damage to bind me. If you’d played with the right people, you'd know that. I’ve got your trap where I want it.""**

**He started laughing, and the laughter echoed** ***around*** **the room—every screen flickering to life like possessed arcade mirrors.**

**I stood still for a second, scanning the room. My eyes landed on the old shelves in the corner.**

**Old cartridges. Atra game boxes. Copies of ancient titles, stacked like dusty relics from a cursed Blockbuster.**

**The slasher kept on with his circus act, making dumb little faces like he was auditioning for a haunted puppet reboot of** ***Looney Tunes*****. I had to hand it to him—he was committed. But he made one big mistake: he went full retro. And I’ve been learning from the necromancer nobilty self.**

**See, Raven showed me a trick. Something about how certain spells—especially binding or locking magic—work better when paired with surprise variables. Colors, textures, emotional intent. I wasn’t just grabbing anything. I reached into my bag and pulled out a neon pink marker.**

**Yeah, pink. Go ahead and laugh, but pink’s magic kryptonite. Raven explained it like this: black’s been used so often for protection or curses, even weaker spirits know how to slip past it. Same with red—aggression, fire, pain. But pink? It’s like telling a ghost to run from bubblegum. The magic short-circuits. It doesn’t know what to do with that kind of energy.**

**So there I was, channeling my inner Uncle B energy—like I was about to bust out a classroom pointer and give this little gremlin a full-on lesson. I started drawing all over his junk with a neon pink marker, chanting one of those new rhythm-based spells. You know the kind—crafted it myself after paying a local magical poet twenty-three bucks. Raven tested it, too. Said it slapped. Perks of that sweet Hasher discount.**

**He paused, twitching like a glitching sprite, his voice rasping through the speakers with mounting horror. ""What in the burnt byte code are you** ***doing*** **to my collection?!""**

**The way he said it—panicked, desperate—reminded me of a toddler watching someone cut the head off their favorite plush toy. All squeaky outrage, like he couldn’t believe someone would defile his little shrine of evil nostalgia.**

**""Me? Just doing a little spring cleaning.""**

**I started to mess with a couple of the creepier ones right in front of his digitized face on the monitor. Flicked on a lighter for some of the more common models—watched the reflection of flickering orange panic in his glassy, fake doll eyes.**

**""This one’s gonna melt real nice,"" I muttered, letting the flame kiss a glossy boot.**

**And of course, I kept a few for myself. My nieces and nephews are going to love these new action dolls. Weird collectible karma with a side of cursed plastic? Yeah, they'll eat that up.**

**Then I started to look at his posters, then back at those games he had stacked like little altars. He was begging me not to do it. Said I was ruining his livelihood here. I might’ve felt sorry—if the guy hadn’t just tried to roast me alive.**

**I stalked from game to game, yanking cords, cracking cases, pulling boards. The plastic snapped under my boots as I stomped them into oblivion. I deleted all his save files first, watching him writhe behind the screen like I’d deleted his soul. Then I started mangling the cartridges and discs.**

**""Oops,"" I said, holding one up. ""Is it** ***Zelda*** **or** ***Zoodle*****? I can** ***never*** **pronounce it right.""**

**He let out a scream like I’d unplugged his last shred of dignity. ""Noooo! Not that one! That was original print!""**

**""Yeah, not anymore it isn’t,"" I said, cracking the shell clean in half.**

**He screamed. Trapped in every screen now, too late to escape.**

**""Not Mario! That was a** ***collector’s edition*****!""**

**""Should’ve thought about that before you tried to roast me.""**

**I smashed the last copy with a clean stomp. The lights went out. The screens died.**

**I pulled out my phone. Called Nicky.**

**""Pick-up. We’re done here.""**

**She answered while sipping a milkshake. Figures.**

**""Game over,"" I said, tossing the remains of the joystick into the nearest trash bin.**

1mf7bof,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mf7bof/i_found_the_coin_they_buried_beneath_the_orphanage/,I Found the Coin They Buried Beneath the Orphanage,"I didn't go back there out of nostalgia. The truth is, for many years, I didn't even remember spending part of my childhood in that place. The orphanage. It was only after Caleb died that the dreams started coming back. At first, they were just flashes—long corridors, windows in places that made no sense, a damp, metallic smell I could never associate with anything outside that building. And then, when I saw the news about the partial demolition, I didn't think twice. I grabbed my car keys and left.

I thought it would be a silent farewell, a personal ritual. But it wasn't. As soon as I arrived, I realized something was off. Not with the place—with time itself. The sunlight seemed frozen, as if the sky was holding its breath. The construction workers let me in with a temporary permit. They said they'd found a false wall in the basement and planned to open it with heavy equipment the following week. But I asked to see it. I didn't know why—I just knew I had to.

The stone was older than anything else in that basement. Cold to the touch, even in the muggy summer heat. And when the breach was finally made, the smell that escaped wasn't mold or dirt… it was something denser, like old meat mixed with incense. They left me alone there for five minutes. That was enough.

The room was small, hexagonal, with symbols carved into the floor and walls—shapes that seemed to move if you stared too long. And in the center, on a stone block that seemed to pulsate, rested a coin. Not just any coin. It was the coin. The same one I'd had since I was left at that orphanage, and that my adoptive parents had kept in a box for decades.

Only, there was an impossible detail. The coin was cracked… exactly like mine was after the fire in my apartment. A diagonal crack, cutting through the symbol in the center, as if it had been wounded from within. I touched it. And everything went dark.

When I opened my eyes, I was lying on the basement floor. The workers were gone. The room's door had vanished. And the coin… the coin was in my hand. That same crack. The same cold. But now, it whispers. Whenever I try to sleep, I hear words in a language I don't know, spoken inside my head, as if they're buried beneath me. And worse: part of me understands what they're saying.

\*\*\*

My name is Martin… and I work as a freelancer for local newspapers in Rhode Island, writing columns about historical heritage, forgotten places, and ruins no one cares to preserve. I've always been drawn to abandoned places. Maybe because I was one of them.

I grew up in Providence, raised by British adoptive parents who never talked much about my origins. They received only a sparse folder of documents and a wooden box containing two things: an embroidered blanket with the initials M.B. and an ancient coin, kept inside a silver case. The box was always with me. They said it came with me the day I was dropped off as a baby at Jefferson Home—a state orphanage that closed its doors in the early nineties. The coin was never truly studied. I once tried to take it to an antique shop, but the man refused to even touch it. He said he couldn't identify its origin and felt uneasy just looking at it. I laughed at the time. Today, I understand.

My life had always been quiet, even predictable. I wake up early, have coffee at the same spot for five years, write in the same notebook, walk the same three streets at night before returning to my apartment. I never married. Never wanted kids. I like order, silence. But in the last few weeks, some things have started to shift. Small details. The kind of thing you only notice after it happens once, twice, three times. A notebook flipped to the wrong side. The kettle out of place. The sound of hammering echoing from the building's basement—always around 3:15 AM.

I told the superintendent. He said there was no renovation happening. No basement even. And when I asked to check the access, he showed me: a solid concrete wall, no doors. That same week, my old memory box fell from the closet. I hadn't touched it in years. And there was the coin. But it wasn't exactly the same anymore. The crack in the center… that was never there before. At least, not that I remembered. And the case, always sealed, was now open.

There was a smell coming from it. As if the metal held something rotten, even though it looked intact. I tried to put it back in the case, but it stuck to my palm for seconds that felt like minutes. And in that brief contact, I saw… something. A place. Stone stairs, silent children in a line, an altar with inscriptions… and a presence I can't explain, as if the space itself was conscious.

I tried not to think about it anymore. I tried to go on with my life normally. But then, the news came. “The former Jefferson Home will be partially demolished to make way for a state library.” I saw the article by chance. It was just a footnote. But when I read it, I felt a shiver. And a phrase popped into my head, as if someone had deliberately dropped it there: They buried something with you. I went to sleep early that night. And I dreamed of Caleb.

I hadn't thought about him in years. He was my childhood friend at the orphanage. I remember him as a shadow: thin, pale, always silent, but with watchful eyes. He would draw corridors and doors that no one else saw. He said the building changed at night. I woke up with the feeling that I had forgotten something very important. But how do you forget something you never knew?

\*\*\*

The next day, I contacted the office responsible for the orphanage's renovation. I pretended to be a journalist interested in doing a story about preserving historic buildings. I didn't have to lie much—it's part of my job, after all. The chief engineer, a friendly guy named Harold, gave me permission to visit the site the following Saturday.

When I arrived, the scene was desolate. The second-story windows were broken, parts of the roof had caved in, and the surrounding lawn was more weeds than grass. The air there was thick, still, as if the place was breathing on its own. Harold met me near the main gate. He was sweaty, his hands dirty with plaster, and seemed relieved to have someone to talk to. He said the workers had refused to continue the basement demolition after finding ""something weird."" According to him, there was a section of the foundation made of stone that wasn't on any original blueprint—as if it were part of an earlier structure, older than the orphanage itself.

""Looks like some kind of chamber,"" he said, scratching the back of his neck. ""But what bothered the crew was the temperature. When we broke through the first layer of the wall, the air inside was… freezing. And it had a strange smell. Not mold. Something denser."" I asked to see. He hesitated for a few seconds, but eventually led me there.

Access to the basement was via a narrow staircase, with chipped stone steps and a rusty handrail. The walls seemed more enclosed than I remembered—as if the place was trying to protect itself from me. Downstairs, three makeshift floodlights illuminated what remained of the structure. And right in the north corner, clinging to the wall like a tumor, was that sealed section. The stones were larger, darker, and contained marks that looked like symbols… but could also be natural cracks. It was hard to tell. I approached slowly, and one of the floodlights flickered for a second. When the light came back, I swear I saw something on the wall—like a shadow moving away. But Harold didn't seem to notice.

""Do you feel that?"" he asked. ""Like the air in here is… heavier?"" I did. But I didn't answer.

\*\*\*

That night, back in my apartment, I decided to look for anything about the origin of that space. I sifted through old files, digitized newspapers, and found a detail that bothered me: before it was Jefferson Home, the building had been a private residence, belonging to a family named Branford. The name hit me like a punch. My last name.

I tried to rationalize. It could be a coincidence. ""Branford"" isn't exactly an uncommon name. But something inside me said it was more than that. I kept investigating until I found an obscure reference in an 1879 periodical: ""The Branford heir sealed the lower chamber after the loss of his son, fearing the voices would call him back."" The article gave no details. Just that.

I stood up, disoriented. I went to the bookshelf, opened the old box where I kept my birth certificate, and examined it as if for the first time. There it was: Martin Thomas Branford. The handwriting was old, slightly shaky. And at the bottom, almost faded, was a Jefferson Home protocol number. At that instant, the coin on the table fell on its own. It didn't roll. It didn't bounce. It simply toppled over as if pushed.

I looked around, trying to understand what had happened. The apartment was silent. But there was something… behind the silence. A faint vibration, like the hum of a forgotten word trying to form. Then I saw it. On the living room wall, above the bookshelf, there was a drawing. Not a childish scribble or a water stain—but a symbol. Round, with ramifications like roots or veins. And in the center, a figure with closed eyes, etched in charcoal or ash. I had never seen it before. I'm sure of it. I approached, touched the mark—and my skin burned as if I'd touched hot iron. I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, took a deep breath. When I returned, the symbol was gone. But the smell… the smell of the chamber was still there.

That night, I received a text message from an unknown number. No name. No greeting. Just one sentence: ""Don't return what was given. They expect it."" The name Caleb immediately came to mind. He used to repeat that phrase when kids hid toys or traded objects. But he said it playfully. At least, I thought he did. Now it no longer seemed like a joke. It seemed like a warning.

\*\*\*

The following days didn't happen in the right order. I'm not sure how to explain it. I'd go to sleep on a Wednesday and wake up on a Monday, with unread messages on my phone, notes in my notebook I didn't remember writing, and dreams that seemed to stretch for weeks within a single night.

The coin never left my sight. But it also never stayed in the same place for long. I'd leave it in a drawer and, hours later, find it on my pillow. Sometimes, on the bathroom floor. One morning, it was inside the refrigerator, on a partially melted ice tray. I lived alone.

I tried to film, leaving my phone recording while I left the house. But the videos would glitch, as if corrupted by an invisible noise. The images always stopped at the same point: 3:15 AM. After that, everything turned to static, interspersed with flashes of images I couldn't identify at first glance. But when I paused one of the frames… my stomach churned. It was the drawing. The round symbol, with the figure of closed eyes. Etched on a wall I didn't recognize—until I remembered one of the rooms in the old orphanage. A room that no longer existed since the 1991 fire.

I started hearing voices. Not like hallucinations. They came from specific places. Behind mirrors. From inside drawers. Once, from the sink drain. Short phrases, in a language I didn't know, but which still caused nausea—as if they were directed directly at my body and not my mind.

I went to my adoptive parents' house. I brought the coin with me, hoping to confront my past with something concrete, familiar. I showed it to them, told them about the strange things, about the name Branford, about the sealed room. My mother paled. She said that once, upon opening the coin's case, she had felt an involuntary tremor in her hands, and that, since then, she avoided touching it. She said my father had nightmares for weeks after picking it up for the first time. They never told me anything, afraid of influencing my childhood mind.

I showed them the birth certificate. She looked at it, but something didn't make sense. The paper in my hands… it wasn't the same one she remembered. According to her, the original document was typewritten. But what I had with me seemed handwritten, with ink that faded in some places. She swore that it wasn't the same paper.

That night, returning home, I found all the lights off—even though I had left a lamp on in the living room, as I always did. I entered slowly, flipped the switch. But there was something wrong with the air. A weight, like before a storm, but with no clouds in the sky. On my bed, I found Caleb's notebook. I hadn't seen it since I was seven.

It was a black, unlined notebook, with childish drawings resembling corridors, doors, arrows pointing down. But now there were additional things. Words written in uneven letters, which seemed made by a child… but weren't. Phrases like: ""The voices come from where the light doesn't touch."" ""You were born of the reverse."" ""They left you here to remember."" The pages were marked with small hand-drawn coins. And on each coin, a different symbol. One of them gave me chills: an open eye inside a mouth.

I tried to distract myself, put on a movie, eat something, pretend normalcy. But the TV turned on by itself, always on the same static channel. And the microwave, unplugged, beeped at 3:15 AM with the word ""OPEN"" on the display, even without the door open. One morning, I went to shower and found the mirror completely fogged up. There was no hot water. Still, drops ran down the glass. I wrote my name with my finger, like a childlike reflex. And right below, without me having touched it, another word appeared: ""RETURN."" The problem was, I didn't know what to return. Or to whom.

I tried to visit a renowned antique dealer in the area, hidden on a narrow street downtown. A very old-looking man served me. When he saw the coin, he backed away three steps, crossed his arms, and said: ""That's not from this side."" I asked him to explain. He just shook his head, like someone trying to forget something they never wanted to remember. ""You should get rid of that,"" he said, ""but it's no use if you're not the one who accepted it.""

I went home feeling like my head was split in two. Part of me wanted to understand. Part of me wanted to forget. But the world wouldn't let me choose. That night, I dreamed of the orphanage. But not in ruins. It was like the eighties: clean corridors, children lined up, soft voices calling names I didn't recognize. I walked to a red door at the end of the corridor, pushed it open slowly… and found myself inside the sealed chamber. On the altar, there was no coin. There was a child. Sitting. Eyes closed. With an expression of profound weariness. And the moment I approached, she opened her mouth… and the sound that came out was the shattering of the mirror in my bathroom—even though I was sleeping on the living room couch. I woke up to the real sound. I went to the bathroom. The mirror had shattered on its own. On the floor, among the shards, was the coin. Spinning slowly, untouched.

\*\*\*

The next morning, I decided to act like a journalist. I needed to understand. I needed to organize the pieces, as I do with any other story. I was tired of feeling like the world was shifting beneath my feet. I sat down at my computer and started researching as if I were writing an article—even if the article was about me.

I started with the name: Branford. There were public records of a family with that surname living in the region in the mid-1800s. The patriarch, Thomas Branford, had founded a property on the same land where, decades later, the Jefferson Home would be built. But there were gaps. Many of them. The property disappears from official records in 1869. No death certificates. No land transfers. It's as if the family evaporated.

I returned to historical databases, old newspapers, state archives. I found a vague quote in an 1879 newspaper: ""The Branford heir sealed the lower chamber after the loss of his son, fearing the voices would call him back."" The same passage I had read before, but now it felt more personal. As if it were written for me.

I opened an old topographical map of the region, dated 1883. On it, there was a small building marked on the grounds of what is now the orphanage. But it wasn't a house. It was a symbol—like a hexagon with internal lines—similar to what I saw drawn on the walls of the sealed room. The legend simply said: ""Guardians' Annex."" Guardians of what?

I sent messages to three local historians, asking about the region's symbolism, about 19th-century cults or sects. One of them replied the same day, saying there were rumors of a Scottish brotherhood that quietly settled in the state, bringing with them practices of ""spiritual protection based on blood inheritance."" The society reportedly disappeared around 1900, but some traditions still survived in isolated families. I sent a digitized photo of the coin. He replied in less than five minutes. ""Can you call me? This is serious.""

I spoke with him on the phone. His voice was trembling. He said he had seen that symbol before, in a manuscript confiscated in the fifties by private collectors. The symbol marked objects that served as ""pact anchors."" He said the object should not be destroyed. Nor abandoned. ""It's not tied to the owner… it is the owner."" The call dropped. I tried to call back, but it was just busy.

I turned off the apartment lights, closed the curtains, and sat on the floor. I held the coin between my fingers. It was cold as ever, but now I felt… a kind of rhythm. Like a faint pulse.

A heartbeat that wasn't mine, but that synchronized with my breathing, as if it were using me to breathe.

I returned to Caleb's notebook. I began to examine the pages carefully, looking for some structure. That's when I realized that the drawings—corridors, doors, coins—formed a map. One I recognized. It was the orphanage. But with sections I had never seen. And in the center, marked by concentric circles, was the sealed room. The name ""Thomas"" appeared several times. Written as a signature. As if he had drawn that. But Caleb couldn't have known the name of the place's founder. Unless…

I went back to my adoption papers. There was a yellowish sheet, hidden among ordinary documents. It was a note in old, almost illegible handwriting, with a symbol at the top—the same as on the coin. The message read: ""Son of Thomas, sealed by blood, born of the reverse. May you never forget to remember.""

I closed my eyes. I felt a terrible chill. I started to consider something I had refused to think about until then: what if I hadn't been left at the orphanage by chance? What if my presence there was part of something much larger? Something built to last generations, waiting for the moment to restart?

I talked to a friend who works with digitizing old documents. I asked him to 3D scan the coin, thinking there might be invisible marks. He agreed. Three days later, he called me, scared. ""Dude… the file won't open. Every time I try to render the model, the computer restarts. I tested it on three machines. One of them crashed and burned out the video card. Did you put some kind of magnet or radioactive metal in that thing?"" I said no. He didn't believe me, but he quickly returned the coin.

From then on, I stopped sleeping properly. I always woke up at 3:15 AM, with the sound of something crawling under the apartment floor. One night, I put my ear against the wooden floor. And I heard something. Footsteps. Small footsteps, like a child's. And heavy breathing. I rushed downstairs to the ground floor, entered the building's basement—which, according to the superintendent, didn't exist—and found myself in front of an ancient wall. Almost the same one I saw at the orphanage. But here there were no cracks. Just symbols etched in charcoal. As I touched the stone, I heard a whisper: ""You are ready to remember.""

I fled, locking the door with a chair. I went back to the apartment and looked out the window. Down below, standing under the darkened streetlamp, was a boy. Dressed like in the eighties. He was holding a black notebook. And he was staring fixedly at me. There was no light. But I saw that he had no eyes.

The next day, I received a letter with no return address. Inside, just a coin identical to mine. No crack. No wear. Like new. And a note, with a phrase written in childlike letters: ""You cannot carry both.""

\*\*\*

It was that night I understood there was no going back. Everything I'd lived until then, all the decisions, paths, even the people I'd met… they were points marked on a trajectory that already existed before me. As if my life had been written in advance, and I was just following the lines blindfolded.

I spent hours sitting on the living room floor, with the coins in my hands, trying to remember things I didn't know I had forgotten. And they came—not as memories, but as feelings imprinted on my body. The smell of the orphanage before bedtime. The sensation of the cold floor beneath bare feet. The sound of the bell calling for the refectory. Voices that called my name, but with a different intonation. One that didn't belong to me.

I opened Caleb's notebook again and realized there were pages I hadn't seen. Pages that would only appear when I was ready. In them, there were instructions. Rituals. Fragments of a language I now recognized. Not clearly—but with familiarity. Like a song heard many times in childhood. A phrase was repeated everywhere: ""You were left to remember, and to remember is to accept."" On the last page, there was a drawing: the altar, with a figure in a fetal position upon it. And an arrow pointing down, toward the basement. But the most disturbing detail was the figure's face: half was mine. The other half, completely smooth.

I fell into a trance. I picked up the coins, went down to the building's basement, and touched the wall—the one the superintendent said didn't exist. It gave way, as if recognizing my presence. Behind it, there were steps. Not wood, nor stone. Something in between. Organic in texture, but firm. I went down without thinking, guided by an instinct that wasn't my own.

At the bottom of the stairs, the room awaited me. This time, it was complete. The living walls, pulsating softly. The altar in the center, bathed in a light that had no source. And all around, hooded figures—not physical, but projected. Like solidified memories in space. All of them looked at me. Without eyes.

I walked to the center.

The coins fused in my hands, melting into a dark metal that covered my fingers and climbed up my arm, to my shoulder. It didn't hurt. It was… familiar. Like putting on an old coat and feeling the known fabric against your skin. Then the voice spoke, not in the environment, but inside my throat: ""You accepted.""

I didn't fully understand what that meant. But part of me grasped it. I was the link. The anchor. I was left to ensure the room wasn't forgotten. To keep the path open. I wasn't the heir to a secret. I was the secret. And with that revelation, something inside me… yielded. It wasn't a possession. It was more subtle. A substitution of thoughts, of memories. Remembering who I was became harder with each passing minute. Words came with a different rhythm. My name sounded strange. And yet, I felt peace. As if the previous confusion was a result of trying to resist. It was easier to accept.

I returned home with a clarity that frightened me. I wrote this account with steady hands, without hesitation. The coins are no longer visible, but I know they are inside me. Sometimes, I feel their weight with every step. Sometimes, I hear the voices in the cracks in the walls. But now… I understand the language.

\*\*\*

Today is the last night. Not because something will happen—but because everything already has. I just caught up to it last. I recorded this account so that something remains outside of me, even if the words soon cease to make sense. The sentences no longer flow as they once did. I need to reread what I just wrote to be sure I was the one who wrote it. Sometimes, I don't recognize my own voice. The bathroom mirror no longer shows me what I expect to see. I hunger for things I can't name. And, this morning, my right arm felt lighter. As if part of it had remained elsewhere.

I went back to the orphanage one last time. The renovation has been suspended. The basement is locked. No employee can explain why. The chamber was sealed with reinforced concrete by order of the city—though no official document confirms this. The chief engineer who guided me there, Harold, no longer appears in the company's records. And his number… now belongs to a flower shop. I asked to go inside. They told me access is prohibited. That the floor is collapsing. That there's a risk of structural failure. But I know it's not the floor. It's the memory. It crumbles. Like the concrete of a forgotten wall.

Earlier today, while having coffee, I noticed something out of place. On the table, there was a note I didn't write: ""Another is already on the way."" And next to it, a new coin. No cracks. No marks. Perfect. I've never seen it before. But it recognizes me. Now, it spins alone on the table. And even without a sound, I hear what it says.

Perhaps, when this video is published, I will no longer be me. Or perhaps, part of me will still remain, like a dark corridor waiting for a door to open. If you are hearing this, and have ever felt that your life isn't entirely your own… if you've ever had the impression that certain decisions were pre-made, or that your memories don't belong to you… then beware. You may have been left to remember too. And when you do remember… it will already be too late.",1,1754080061.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1mf7bcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mf7bcw/i_24m_am_emotionally_exhausted_from_my/,"I (24M) am emotionally exhausted from my relationship with my girlfriend (20F), and I don’t know how to move forward","*TLDR: I'm a 24M in an 8-month relationship with a 20F. After she temporarily moved in due to an injury, I’ve been feeling increasingly emotionally and mentally drained. I do most of the care work and feel like I'm constantly managing her emotions while neglecting my own needs and connections. She's loving at times, but also shows jealousy, controlling behavior, and emotional volatility. A major conflict escalated after she met my parents, which she called ""torture"". Right now, I feel overwhelmed, emotionally depleted, and unsure whether this relationship is healthy for me.*

We've been dating for almost a year, officially together for eight months. It’s by far the most intense relationship I’ve ever been in – emotionally rich, but also incredibly draining, especially over the past few months.

The biggest strain recently was her moving into my tiny 20sqm flat for over a month after she broke her foot. Her own place wasn't accessible for someone on crutches, and I offered she stay with me. While she was very grateful, sharing such a small space for that long was overwhelming. I ended up taking care of nearly everything: cooking, cleaning, helping her bathe, doing her groceries, driving her to the hospital, giving her injections. Meanwhile, I’ve completely neglected my thesis and coursework. I'm falling behind in everything – especially myself.

She recently moved back to her own flat and has started handling more things herself, which helps. But much of the emotional and mental load is still on me.

Our relationship isn't bad in every way. She's supportive, gives thoughtful gifts, showers me with compliments, and we share similar humor and interests. We genuinely have fun together. But the difficult parts are starting to outweigh the good.

I tend to avoid conflict, I’m a people-pleaser, and I’m currently trying to get into therapy (which is hard where I live). I’m aware I struggle to assert my needs, which contributes to the imbalance. But my girlfriend is very anxious and needs constant reassurance – sometimes even about small things like which jewelry she wore or why I didn’t bring her coffee. Silence makes her nervous. She gets jealous easily and often feels excluded when I spend time with friends. She sometimes asks, ""Why didn’t you tell me?"" even about small details of my day – or why I didn’t text her about something.

One major fight happened after she met my parents for the first time. I had hoped it would be a positive experience – but afterward she said the weekend was ""torture"", called my parents ""creepy"" and ""disrespectful"", and complained about food and walking (even though I’d told her in advance that we usually walk and eat light). I spent most of the weekend isolated with her in my childhood room. On the drive back, she was furious that I had hugged my parents goodbye. She told me, ""Either you touch me or you touch them"", and refused physical contact until I washed my hands. I seriously considered ending the relationship then.

Unfortunately, this theme has come up before. Early in our relationship, she expressed discomfort with my friendship with a female colleague and close friend of mine. Though she denied wanting me to cut contact, she repeatedly implied that my continued friendship was hurtful. Later, she insisted I should ""act like everything is normal"" and talk about that friend openly – which completely confused me.

At this point, I feel like I’m losing myself. I barely have time for my own needs. Even though she says she loves me as I am, she often tries to change me – from what I eat, to even how I sit or how I dry my hair. I feel drained.

I’m writing here because I don’t know what to do. How do I communicate or let alone move forward from this situation, how do I get help? Is this kind of exhaustion ""normal"" in a relationship where one partner is temporarily dependent? Or are these deeper issues that won’t go away with time or care? I’m trying to be supportive, but I feel like I’m slowly disappearing.

Any perspectives – especially given that I don’t think I’m thinking clearly – advice, or shared experiences would be welcome. Thank you.",0,1754080039.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

I don’t do anything productive, I don’t do anything helpful. I don’t even do anything that I truly enjoy anymore. When I’m having “fun” it’s just a distraction from the fact that I’m completely useless and have no direction in life. I’m too scared to do anything. I’m supposed to be finishing up stuff in order to prepare for going back to college on the 25th, but I’m not ready. I already have this sinking feeling that it’s going to end up exactly the same as last time. I drive to class, I cry in my car instead of going, then I drive back home where I lay in bed and rot instead of working on anything. Everything feels pointless and I have no hope for the future. People ask me what my plans are and I sort of freeze up before making up some bullshit that sounds good. That won’t work forever and it’s a lie. I have no plans. I have no hopes. I have no dreams. No ambition. No talent. Nothing that is necessary in order to make a life for myself. I’m a bad friend and I’m a burden to those around me. I live with my parents and I don’t pay rent, I don’t do anything. I’m a leech and they deserve better. All of my siblings are smart and have paths forward. I’m the oldest and I’m supposed to set a good example but instead I’m 22 and living at home while everyone else my age graduates and gets jobs and gets married and moves into their own place. And I just sit here, wasting all of my time. I can’t keep doing it. I’m tired of being here when I don’t like it. I don’t like it here. I don’t like being alive. I hate waking up in the morning. I use to LOVE the morning. I could get up late on a Saturday, drink my coffee and read a book next to the window. But I can’t stand it anymore. I struggle to get through more than 1 book every few months because my stupid brain can’t focus on shit, and every time I wake up I immediately have to deal with the fact that I exist and I’m alive. And there’s nothing I can do about it!! If I kill myself it will hurt people, but if I stay alive I’m going to keep ending up more miserable than before. Eventually people won’t buy my bullshit excuses for not being further along in life and I’ll end up the disappointment of the family. I already am, because I’m trans in a super conservative Christian family, but there’s nothing I can do to fix that. I COULD get my life together. I SHOULD be able to do that and at least be able to support myself. But I don’t want to. I want to be done. I don’t have a plan to end things, but if something doesn’t change soon I will be making one because I cannot keep going.",2,1754079943.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False
1mf78np,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1mf78np/help_possible_egg_case_found/,Help! Possible egg case found,"I purchased a condo in Scottsdale, Arizona, in the fall and did not see one bug until June 1st. Having lived most of my life here, I’m used to the occasional American roach coming up from the drains or cracks between the door and doorframe; however, I have been spotting them almost daily since late June. I’ve had pest control come out twice in the last month to do a spray, which includes Alpine WSG, and I’ve been waking up to dead or dying ones mostly in or near the kitchen. I put down Advion gel bait, added more weather stripping to my front door, made sure all surfaces were clean, and poured bleach down the drain, but I keep seeing them!

After my most recent pest control service (I made them come out for the 2nd time in a month), I decided I needed to do an even deeper clean and moved my refrigerator and stove, vacuumed, and scrubbed the floors under them with bleach. I found the most evidence of roach activity (droppings) under the refrigerator and purchased Maxforce bait. When I moved the refrigerator back, I noticed what appeared to be a hollowed, opened coffee bean on the floor. I tossed it in the trash not thinking much of it. 

Yesterday I moved the fridge again and sprinkled the Maxforce bait behind it. While I was shining a light towards the back of the refrigerator near the motor, a roach scurried out, ran behind my dishwasher, and I could hear it crawling around bags in the cabinet under the sink. Eventually I opened the cabinet under the sink and noticed it was dead.

Now I’m panicking thinking that thing I thought was a dried out coffee bean was actually an empty egg case and I have hundreds of roaches living in my home. I know an American roach infestation inside is pretty rare but I’ve noticed the dead roaches I’ve seen lately appear smaller, like they’re younger. Is that a possibility????

My pest control company said I need to wait at least another week before they spray again even though I told them I saw a live one.

Since I’m impatient, I went out and bought Combat large roach bait traps and sticky pads (haven’t put them down yet), sprinkled the Maxforce bait that came from Amazon yesterday, and have Cimexa arriving today. Today is the first day I didn’t see one upon waking, but I’m also cat sitting. I called my local Bug & Weed Mart to see about purchasing Alpine WSG and Gentrol, as recommended in this subreddit, and the guy proceeded to explain the history of American roaches and how they’re all over yards, especially in wealthy areas 🤨, without even letting me explain my situation. He started to tell me that’s not what I need to deal with American roaches before I told him I’d go down and chat in person, but now I don’t want to do that if I can avoid it. Is there anything else I can do????

TLDR: found what appeared to be an American roach egg case near my fridge, still seeing roach activity despite pest control and bait. Do I have a possible infestation? Besides bait, sticky pads, pest control using the Alpine WSG, and Cimexa, what else can I do to eradicate these creatures from my home?",1,1754079857.0,pestcontrol,1,1.0,False

We text all week and video call.
We had arranged to go for a coffee the following Sunday.
Then last Friday he said why don’t we meet up he thinks we have a connection.
So for some reason I agree, I get to the car park and he arrives after me, he said let’s go for a walk he held my hand, then a few later puts his tongue down my throat. It seemed a very full on kiss after minutes of meeting someone.
Then he said let’s get into his car. I just did it, then we started to make out and had sex, it was incredible. Afterwards he told me he’s actually 55 not 47 but he’s telling me because he likes me.
He’s been in the army and navy and married for 27 years he likes to mention his ex wife a lot btw!
He doesn’t have kids apparently he can’t.
We texted later that night then the next day then arranged to meet on Sunday for a walk with his dog. It was a horrible day and this was a wild field he met me at, we found shelter under a tree straight away his hands are in my trousers. I felt too exposed it was near a road so walked away. Then he made a tent, we had a coffee then we had sex. After about an hour he packed up his things and said let’s go, you’re not really the outdoor type.
Then as I was getting into my car he said thanks for the use of your pussy again. I just got in my car and left.
Now he’s stopped texting me altogether and Tuesday there he asked if I would go round to his house for a shag. I said I can’t.

Does this sound normal or I’m I being incredibly naive?

I'm used to the sound by now, these days it doesn't affect me the slightest. Nor do their cries or the begging for mercy, it's always the same. What surprises me this time is that there is no begging or crying, she is silent where she stands on her knees with her head tilted up.
The gun is aimed right at her, with only the moon to light up this black alley. The gun is fired, and the shot echoes between the walls of the houses before she falls to the ground in a pile, not moving while fast footsteps are heard on the pavement.
""You know what to do!"" I tell my right man Vito, when he turns around and walks away. I'm quick over to the woman on the ground and take a closer look at her when I see her arms moving a bit. Blood is pumping out of the wound on her head, and she shouldn't be alive right now.
""To..."" I think I hear her say, and I look at her for a bit longer, wondering if it really could be her that spoke or if I've just imagined it. The ground underneath her head is coated red when I see her breathing slowing down while her lips continue to move, trying to form a word.
Something is telling me I need to get closer. Squatting down beside her on the ground while leaning closer when she spurts blood out of her mouth. Her blond hair is almost completely painted red by now, while her eyes are staring up in the sky. Not sure she is aware I'm here beside her when she starts to move her lips again.
""Tov..."" She says this time when blood spurts out of her mouth again and cuts the rest of the word from her lips. She takes a strained breath while I turn my head to look the way Vito went, but he isn't back yet.
""Tovia..."" I hear the whole word in a whisper from her lips, it doesn't say anything to me, and I just look at her silently. They're the last words from a dying person, and something always stirs inside my soul and touches me in a way when death takes its grip and no one can escape it.
Waiting for her to say something else, she only repeats the word Tovia once more before her lips stop moving. Light footsteps come from the other side of the alley in a rush.
I rise and look at the pale woman on the ground for a second before turning around and walking back the other way to stay hidden in a dark place behind one of the houses when I hear Vito walking up beside me. His footsteps I'm used to by now, and I recognize them everywhere.
""It's done,"" he says when I raise my hand to stop him from continuing to talk. The light footsteps are coming closer, and the woman on the ground is still breathing when I see her lips move again, even from where I'm standing.
The moment the young woman appears from the other way, my heart skips a beat with how beautiful she is, her raven black hair reaches far down her back. Her petite body is perfectly sculpted with curves in the right places, she is a sight for the eye. Her ice-blue eyes shine like diamonds in the night, and I find myself mesmerized by her, and no one ever catches my attention this way.
""We have to leave before this place is swarmed,"" Vito says in a low voice beside me when I can't take my eyes off the young woman, and I know even before she has reached the woman on the ground, she knows her, and the heartbreaking scream that tears from her lips stirs up a feeling inside my body I have never felt before.
This urge to protect her and comfort her makes me all warm inside, and I never feel anything like this. No one ever manages to make me feel anything other than anger and indifference, but here, just the sight of the young woman has me feeling things I never thought I could.
She falls on her knees beside the woman on the ground, and I can hear her scream ""No, please no"" repeatedly when she grabs her hand and holds it in hers. The sight in front of me hits me like a dagger in my heart, and I can't explain why.
All the other times I have seen something just like this one, not once has it ever affected me. But there is something about this young woman that makes me want to hold her tight in my arms and never let her go. Something is pulling every cell in my body towards her, I have never felt this way before.
""Carlo,"" Vito whispers to me when I hear several footsteps behind us and it's time for us to leave. This place will be swarmed soon, and we better not linger here even if I have a hard time walking away from the young woman.
""Please, somebody help me."" I hear her scream while I just look at her from my hiding spot. She hasn't noticed us when she screams again and starts to look around for help.
For her sake, I wish there could be another outcome, but the woman on the ground is past all salvation. The gunshot wound in her head is deadly, and she should already be dead by now, no one survives that kind of wound.
It doesn't matter if she gets medical help, it won't save her, and I'm not sure she is even aware of her surroundings or that the young woman is by her side.
I take one last look at her when I turn around and start to walk back to the car we parked on the other side. Vito is right after me, and my heart skips a beat when I hear her cry out for help once again. My body wants to go back and pick her up in my arms and take her with me, comforting her from the pain.
""The car is ready and waiting,"" Vito says when we turn around the next building, and I see my other men standing outside and waiting for us. The back door is opened when I climb inside, and Vito takes a seat beside me and closes the door when the driver starts the car and pulls out from the side of the road.
""I want all the information on the young woman, make sure you find out what she was doing there and where she lives,"" I tell Vito when he picks up his phone and starts to type on it.
""I will have everything for you in a few hours,"" he says when the car takes a turn to the right. I'm going to find that woman again, no one can slip away from me in my city.
Chapter 2
Tovia pov
It's late in the evening, and I'm walking from the library over to my mother's work to join her on the way back home.
I stop outside at the back of the restaurant, where I know she will come out in just a bit. Waiting, I take a deep inhale of the fresh air. It's in the middle of September and still warm during the days, but this late in the evening it has started to cool off.
""Hey Tovia, waiting for your mother?"" I hear the familiar voice and turn my head to the side when I see Bonnie, our coworker and friend from the restaurant, walking out the door.
I often take some extra shifts when I have the time here as well, and Bonnie is a few years older than me and one of my best friends. She has auburn hair and the kindest light brown eyes I've ever seen.
""Hi, yes, I am,"" I say, and give her a smile when she walks closer to where I'm standing.
""She is almost done, we are working together on Sunday. Looking forward to it,"" she says, and I smile bigger.
""Me too. Are you done for the day?"" I ask even if I know she probably is.
""Yes, I'm just heading over to visit my grandma at the nursing home,"" she says when I see the small brown bag in her hands and I guess she is bringing her some leftover food.
""Say hi for me, I'll see you on Sunday,"" I say when she waves goodbye. Right at the same time, the back door is opened again and my mother peeks her head out.
""Tovia, can you come inside and help me?"" She says, and I start to walk over to the door without any questions. It happens sometimes when some customers linger in the restaurant, and I can help her get the kitchen cleaned up while she takes care of them.
I don't mind doing some dishes, it doesn't take that long, and once I hear her talking by the cashier, I know she is almost done. I have finished the dishes and grab the towel to dry my hands before going over to the door and looking through the window.
My mother is standing behind the cashier when my eyes land on two men in front of her, ready to pay. The moment the first man turns his head to look my way I get this chill down my back. There is no doubt in my mind that man is evil.
My mother takes a step to the side without knowing I'm watching them when she cuts off the sight of the man, but instead I get a clear view of the other man. He doesn't look my way, but he gives me the same bad feeling and I instinctively start to look for signs or tattoos on him to rule out if they are mafia men or not.
We have two mafia families in this city, and I'm not sure which one is the worst to run into, both families are bad. One of them has a smaller size of the city, and the other one is ruling most of the city.
My mother has taught me since I was very young to look for any signs they are from the mafia and stay as far away from them as I can. Today I'm good at see who's from the mafia and who's not, and the men in front of my mother are. I can't say from which of the families, though.
We usually don't get the men in here, and I don't like it when they do. I hear them talk before they both start to walk towards the door and head out of the restaurant while I'm opening the door to the restaurant and walk quickly towards the front door to lock it.
""Tovia, hurry and get back in the kitchen right after,"" my mother says when I have reached the door. Locking it, I look out the window when my eyes are drawn to a man standing and leaning against a black car with tinted windows. I can't tell what kind of car it is other than it's expensive, and the man that stands there is partly hidden by the darkness when he suddenly pushes from the car and takes a step forward into the light.
My heart skips a beat when I see him clearly under the light. With his black suit and dark hair, he looks dangerous. He has a muscular body and tall frame under that suit. I know he is a mafia man, but I don't know who he is either.
""Tovia, get back in the kitchen now,"" my mother says, and I hear how stressed she sounds when I have to peel my eyes away from the man and turn around to hurry back.
I know she wants us to stay as far away from their sight or getting in their way as possible, and she is right about it. You don't want to be a witness in their fight if it's men from both of the families.
""I'm done with it all, let's hurry home,"" my mother says and quickly pushes me out the back door while she turns off the lights and walks out herself. She locks the door and grabs my arm with hers before we quickly start to rush away from the restaurant and back to our home.
We walk towards our home when there are some fast steps approaching us from behind. Taking another turn and walking on the sidewalk, we hear an engine moving closer this way, and there are never any cars driving on these backways when my mother drags me into a dark alley and turns me to look at her.
""Tovia, get back home quickly and make sure no one follows you. You know where to go and what to do if you are being followed,"" she says in a low voice while my stomach drops from her words and the obvious fear in her eyes.
""Let's go together, don't want us to split,"" I anxiously say and hold her eyes with mine when I see tears well over and run down her cheeks.
""You have to go yourself, I'll be right after! And whatever you hear, don't come back for me,"" she says, and now I feel tears burn behind my eyelids. Why is she talking this way?
""Mom, I can't go without you."" I beg when the engine comes closer and I can feel my mother's grip on my arms tighten.
""Tovia, you have to go and keep going. I will be home in a bit, and remember everything I have told you,"" she says when her voice cracks in the end.
""Mom,"" I start to say when she cuts me off.
""No, Tovia, go! I love you,"" she says and drops her grip on me before giving me a hard push, so I take a stumbling step to the side. Looking at her with my heart beating frantically in my chest and tears running down my cheeks in pure fear of what's going to happen. I know I have promised her before to leave if we ever ended up in a situation like this, but right now I can't do it.
I hardly manage to get any air down my lungs while she tries to reassure me it will be fine with her eyes, and I take a small step back while looking at her.
""I love you,"" I manage to squeeze out while my voice cracks at the end. Forcing myself away from her by the promise I have made to her, I sprint down the dark alley when I hear fast, heavy footsteps moving closer to where I left her.
I try to keep my mind on what I'm supposed to do, but my feet suddenly stop behind a wall, and I can't make them move. I haven't gone too far from where I left her, and I just wait to hear her footsteps coming this way, but the longer I wait, the worse the feeling grows in my stomach.
The feeling doesn't stop when I suddenly hear the sound I never wanted to hear again. A gun goes off, and this time my feet start to move on their own, back to where I came from, a slow step at a time.
I know I promised her to never go back no matter what I heard, but I shouldn't have left her!

Looking at her pale face while the machine beeps in the background, one heartbeat at a time. My eyes are drawn to her chest, looking at it while it rises for each breath. I know it's all because of the machines that are keeping her alive.
She shouldn't be alive right now, but despite all odds she is and looking at her she is fighting. I can't give up on her. It's been a month since the shooting and there hasn't been much improvement. She is here, and at the same time she isn't.
""I see you are here again,"" I hear the old nurse say when she comes walking inside the room to check up on my mother. She is kind and always tries her best to cheer me up.
""Yes,"" I say and turn my head back to look at my mother on the bed, only hoping she will give me any sign she is here and getting better when there are several other footsteps outside the room before the doctor comes walking inside with his apprentice.
""Good, you are here!"" He says and walks over to flash a flashlight in my mother's eyes, looking for any changes, but there isn't anything.
""We have to talk"" he says while the apprentice walks over to place some x-rays on a device before a light is turned on behind them. I have no idea what they are, other than it looks to be a brain on the x-rays.
""You see, we ran some tests yesterday to see if there were any improvements,"" the doctor says, and by the tone of his voice I can tell it's not good news.
""This is her brain the first couple of days after the shooting, and here they are from yesterday,"" he says while the apprentice changes the x-rays. I don't have to be a doctor or nurse to tell there aren't any changes for the better, and my heart drops at the sight of them.
""I'm sorry I don't have good news, but there aren't any improvements, and at this point we are declaring her brain dead. The shot was fatal, and she wouldn't still be breathing if it weren't because of the machines,"" he continues while I look at him, empty for words when my mouth just wants to scream for losing her. She can't leave me, she just can't!
""I'm sorry for bringing you bad news, but at this point it's best to let her body go,"" he continues when I feel shattered on the inside. My mom, I can't lose her.
""N...no."" I manage to stammer while tears start to run down my cheeks. My lungs are squeezing hard in my chest when the last breath is about to leave my body. If she's going I want to go with her.
""I wish there was anything else to do, but there isn't. Your mother isn't coming back,"" the doctor continues when I feel my knees give out on me and I end up on the floor with my hands in my lap. My world is closing in on me, and there is no way I can get any air down my lungs. My heart is breaking, she can't leave me.
""Oh, dear child,"" I hear the old nurse say from far away before I'm wrapped up in a tight hug. She is holding me tight to her, my head is on her shoulder when a deep scream tears from my lips in desperation.
""No, Mom!"" I hear myself scream while whatever pieces I have left of my heart are breaking; how am I ever going to survive without her? How can this be it?
""Take a deep breath with me"" I hear the nurse say, but my lungs are shut close. I don't even care what happens with me right now. I have been by her side day and night for one month, hoping there would be the slightest change. I have begged her to not leave me, cried by her side only to come to this.
""Get a nurse in here with sedative!"" I hear the doctor's voice boom out from a far distance, it's like I'm not really here. I'm outside my body looking in to see the room and another nurse comes rushing inside before there is a sting in my arm.
It's calming, and I welcome it. I'll take anything just to get free from this pain I feel. I don't want this to happen, it can't be true.
""Relax, it will be alright, child,"" I hear the older nurse say while she is holding me tightly. My body is slowly relaxing, giving in to the sedative. I'm relieved I don't have to fight it when I stop and just give in to the blur, and it doesn't take long before everything goes black.
""How are you feeling?"" I hear the nurse's voice say when I slowly start to come back to my senses. I'm lying on something soft while I'm warm and comfortable. I try to wake up when everything comes crashing back at me and someone is grabbing my hand.
""Just breathe; everything will be alright,"" she says calmly with a soothing voice, but how can she say that when nothing will ever be alright again? My mother isn't coming back, and there is nothing that's going to change it.
""I know it's hard to grieve a close relative, but we will always carry them with us in our hearts,"" she says, but there is nothing that will make it feel any better.
""Look at me, child,"" she says when I slowly open my eyes to meet hers. She stands beside me with a calm expression on her face.
""I know your mother wants nothing else for you than for you to be happy and live your life, you can honor her by doing so,"" she says, but I feel empty inside when there are footsteps closer to the door before there's a knock on it. She drops my hand and walks over there to open it.
""Come in, she is awake,"" the nurse says when I see my boyfriend slowly walking inside with my best friend from school right behind him. Looking at them I'm about to burst out in tears, this is all too much for me.
""I'll be back in a bit to check on you, it will be alright"" the nurse says before she slowly walks out the door after she has given me one last glance.
She closes the door after her when I turn to look at Andy, my boyfriend. We have been together for two years, and I'm grateful he is here when I'm going through this.
""I didn't want to come here and do this, but you never leave the hospital,"" he snaps at me when I look at him shocked. I can't understand what's going on with him when my best friend walks up beside him and places her hand in his.
My eyes are glued to their hands while all blood leaves my head.
Chapter 4

I'm frozen to my spot while looking at their intertwined fingers, she places her head on his shoulder while smirking at me.
""What's going on?"" I manage to say while moving up on the bed, resting my back against the headboard. They look at each other, and it dawns on me what's going on before he continues.
""Dollface here is my new girlfriend,"" he says with nothing but wickedness in his voice, and my stomach drops by his words when I toss the blanket off me and place my feet on the cold floor.
""What! How can you do this to me?"" I blurt in shock and heartache, realizing he has gone behind my back.
""I'm not doing anything to you, it's rather you who never takes time for me! Always staying here in the hospital!"" He barks at me and his words are like a punch right in my stomach. Is he serious about what he's saying?
""It's my mom,"" I say in a low voice while looking right at him, hardly able to believe this is true when he places his arm around her shoulders instead.
""Your priority should be me, but here you are, always with your vegetable mother."" He snaps when I just look silently at him. Right now I don't recognize him at all, and I thought after two years I knew him. The person in front of me feels like a complete stranger.
""When you weren't there for me, Dollface here did everything for me. Like any woman should do to her man,"" he snarls. I know what he is insinuating; I didn't want to give up my virginity until we had passed two years together, and that time was a few days after my mother got shot.
I wanted to wait, didn't feel quite ready yet and then my mother got shot when the two-year mark came. I never in my imagination thought he would do anything like this, I thought he was a good guy. It's obvious I was wrong here.
""Get out!"" I snap at them when I'm starting to feel nothing else than pure anger. None of them have any empathy for me or what's been going on, or they would never have done this to me. I thought she was my best friend from school, but I was wrong there as well. That mistake I'm never going to do again. Trusting in two persons the way I have.
""We are just making sure you understand we are over!"" He barks at me when I feel everything inside shut down, I have no emotion left to show.
""You can be sure the message is clear. Now get out!"" I bark at them with a voice I never thought I could have. The door to the room flies open, and a young nurse comes storming inside. I guess she heard me.
""You heard her, get out!"" She is quick to say once she has taken a good look at them both and me. It's clear she understands what's going on here when she pushes them out of the room and walks over to me before wrapping me up in her arms.
""This is the last thing you needed. I'm so sorry,"" she says with a calm voice. I can tell she is a nice and genuine woman with the way she acts.
I don't know what it is that shuts down inside my body, but I don't feel any pain. It's just turned off, and all that's left is anger. How the fuck can someone be that evil? Like, they just were. I could never hurt anyone else the way they just did.
""I'm so sorry, I'm here for you,"" she continues to say before releasing me from her hug and holding me at arm's length.
""Thank you,"" I say while looking at her. Her red hair is framing her gorgeous face, she has gray eyes and white skin. She can't be older than in her mid-twenties, and the pained expression she has on her face says it all.
""I'm a friend of Bonnie, working at the nursing home where her grandmother is,"" she says, and it relaxes me just the fact that she knows my friend from work, and right now the only friend I've got left that I trust.
""Thank you for everything, but I need to go,"" I say after my eyes land on the clock on the wall. A whole day has gone by, and it's already nine pm.
""Of course, I'm letting the doctor know you want some days to think about what he told you, and I'm calling Bonnie. I know she is waiting for you,"" she says when I'm about to walk away from her. I see her name tag on her shirt.
""Thank you for everything, Lovita,"" I say when she gives me a warm smile before walking over to the door and holding it up for me.
My shoes are on the floor with my handbag when I take them on and head after her. They placed me in this room after I went out, and right now I need to head home instead.
""I'm here for you,"" she says when I walk past her and keep going down the hallway. My eyes are on the floor while I walk with nothing else than emptiness in my heart. I don't even care if I meet anyone I know on the way.
My mind is everywhere and nowhere at the same time when I walk out the door of the hospital and turn left. I'm used to walking these dark roads to get home, and today I need the walk.
I haven't met anyone for a long time walking this way when I see a black car passing me by to the left on the road. I instantly get a bad feeling when I see it's a car from the Mafia. I don't know for sure it was the Mafia that was behind the shooting of my mother, but I believe it was.
I'm quick to take the road to the right and quicken my pace when I hear an engine approach fast behind me. Dodging behind a house when the car stops, I start to run instead while pulling the hood from my sweatshirt over my head.
""Stop!"" I hear a dark voice boom from behind me when I grab for my bag and quickly pull the gun my mother had at home in her drawer. Turning around, I see a mafia man stop in his tracks a bit away from me while chuckling.
""Little girl, you don't dare to shoot me,"" he mocks and takes another step while I aim at him.
""Then this will come as a surprise to you."" I snap while pulling the trigger without hesitation, and the gun goes off. I see him fall to his knees when I quickly turn around and start running again for my life. I know if they caught me, I'm dead, and they will not get that satisfaction, never!
I have had enough shit for one day!
Chapter 5
Two years later.
Tovia pov
Staring at the empty fridge in front of me, the only thing that's left is the bread and a piece of cheese I've already taken out and placed on the counter. It's enough for one sandwich, but that's all.
I've already emptied the other cabinets yesterday, and I don't have any money to buy new food until the end of the week, if I'm lucky. I have sold everything of value in the apartment, there isn't anything else I can use.
Walking over to the table, I take a seat in this small kitchen on the white chair. The sun is shining through the window, spreading a warm feeling in the room. Sipping on the second cup of coffee while I twirl the ring on my finger my mother gave me, a pang of sadness washes over me.
I used to sit in the kitchen on this chair watching my mother make us breakfast. Her happy mood with her big smile was the best time of the day before we had to leave. These days it only feels empty inside the kitchen, and I miss hearing her voice more than anything.
The reality is hard to accept, it shouldn't be this way.
""Whose little feet am I hearing?"" I place my cup on the table and turn to face the doorway when the small footsteps come walking closer until she appears in the doorway. She's still in her pink pajamas with unicorns on, and her blond hair and innocent blue eyes make her look like an angel.
I don't have her blond hair, mine is raven black. The eyes we have are the same, but that's about it. She is all I have left and one of the reasons I'm fighting to survive.
""There's my little Elli,"" I say in a soft tone before I get up and walk closer to where she stands when she throws herself in my arms. Catching her, I wrap her up in my arms and hug her close to me.
""I'm hungry,"" she says, and at least I have some food left for her.
""Let's make you a sandwich before we leave, we're going to see Mommy today,"" I tell her before placing her down on the chair beside me and heading over to fix her sandwich. I ate some leftovers at work yesterday, and I have to make do with that for a bit. There can be days when I don't get to eat anything, and I always try to save what little food I can for Elli.
The morning routine goes fast as usual, and it doesn't take long until we are outside the door, heading down the stairs, when my stomach starts to rumble, and I know it's not the best for my stomach with this amount of coffee, but it takes the edge off the hunger.
""Tovia!"" I hear his voice from the side, and I sigh in my head. I hoped we could get away from here without bumping into him. I know I can't avoid him and stop in my tracks with Elli. Turning my head his way, I see the old man come walking closer.
""I get my salary on Friday, I will pay the rent by then,"" I say when I see the old landlord having a concerned look on his face.
""That's good, but I'm afraid we can't go on this way if you don't pay in time,"" he says, and I know what he means. He has been kind and giving me time when everything happened with my mother two years ago, but I know at one point he can't keep being this nice to me, and I'm behind with three months rent by now.
It doesn't matter what I do, I'm never catching up with the salary I have, and all the bills I can't pay just grow in a pile. I'm at a point where I don't know what I'm going to do.
""I promise I will pay everything I can on Friday,"" I say when he stops in front of me.
""You know I hate to put more pressure on you, wish it didn't come to this,"" he says, and I hear how pained he sounds in his voice. It was my mother who found this place when she moved us here, and she loved the apartment, and the landlord has always been kind to us.
When everything happened with our mother, he let us live here free for six months while I had to drop out of my last year at school to find work instead. It all depends on me to get money and make sure we survive, and it hasn't been easy.
I left my old life and most of my friends abandoned me when I had to grow up so fast and take my responsibility. I couldn't let my sister be taken by the social services just to end up in foster care. I was eighteen and my sister had just turned two when it happened.
""I know, but I promise I'm going to pay what I can on Friday,"" I say and start to walk away.
""Come by and have some dinner with us this weekend, my wife misses you both,"" he says to my back when I turn my head and give him a smile in return for his kindness. I know they don't have the funds to let us live rent-free, and none of this is their problem, it's all mine, and I have to figure it out.
I'm in deep thought when we walk all the way over to the hospital, and not once is Elli complaining about how far we have to walk. She has gotten used to this by now.
Reaching the hospital, we walk over to the elevator without looking at the front desk, trying to get into the elevator without trouble, but I don't get to be that lucky when the most annoying and disgusting man I know walks up beside me.
""Here to visit again?"" His voice sends a disgusting chill down my back, and I ignore him when the elevator doors are opened, and we walk inside. Unfortunately, he does the same and I curse inside my head.
When I look outside the doors, I see the most handsome man I have ever laid my eyes on walk towards the elevator.
He is tall and has dark hair, almost as dark as mine. He is muscularly built, and everything about him screams power and danger. I don't have to guess to already know he is one of the mafia families that's running this city.
All blood suddenly leaves my head when I realize who it is and where I saw him the last time. He was the man from outside the restaurant where my mother got shoot, one of the men, I'm sure, has something to do with what happened to her. Not to mention I shot a mafia man and have no idea what happened to him.
Holding harder on Elli's hand when I see them walk closer and starting to press the button to the floor frantically to get the doors to close before they get inside here as well.
My heart starts to pick up its pace in pure panic, we have to get away from him.

Sarah overlooked the children at first, but she heard the laughter and the giggles. A soft, tuneless murmur that drifted through the walls in the late afternoons, sometimes light and sometimes barely there, like something breathing just beneath the floorboards. It wasn’t unpleasant.

She’d moved into the apartment complex three weeks ago. A weathered little building with mismatched paint on the doors and a landlord who answered texts with emojis instead of words. But the rent was cheap, and her classes were just a fifteen-minute walk away. That was enough.

The Neighbours, if they were home, kept to themselves. She only heard them in passing. For instance, a cupboard closing, the occasional tapping of feet as though someone paced the hallway, or even the sound of the elevator doors opening and closing.

That afternoon, she noticed two children standing outside her door. A girl in a yellow dress and a boy with curls falling into his eyes, twins. The hallway light flickered when they spoke, and Sarah almost laughed at how cinematic it felt.

“We live next door,” the girl said. “You’re the new one?”

Sarah hesitated. “Yeah. Apartment 6A.”

The boy didn’t say anything, just held tightly to a plush rabbit that looked like it had been washed too many times. His shoes were untied and worn vice-versa. The girl’s dress had a stain near the hem, like raspberry juice or watercolor paint.

“Our mum says we can go to the waterpark this weekend,” the girl went on. “You should come.”

She smiled, and Sarah felt something strange curl beneath her ribs. It reminded her of summers she spent with her mother flying her favourite kite.

“Maybe,” she said, “Do you like flying kites?”

“What is a kite?” the girl asked, moving closer to Sarah.

“I will show you when we visit the park.”

After that, the twins came often. Sometimes in the morning, waiting outside her door with questions that didn’t sound like questions. Sometimes in the afternoon, I stand outside the building waiting for her to play with them. Sarah started getting snacks, and they began leaving drawings. A child’s sort of barter.

She never saw the parents. Not once, but the children always spoke of them from time to time, but not that much.

*“Mum’s cooking tonight.”* They would say.

*“Dad says we’re not allowed to go past the third floor.”*

*The kind of conversations you would have with eight-year-olds. However, they never spoke once about their favourite school teacher as if they never existed. Alina spoke as if she had never had friends; however, Drew spoke about a boy once, and never again. He did include him in one of his drawings, Carl.*

Sarah was taking out the trash when she saw them again. Alina and Drew were standing by the stairwell, like they’d been waiting for her. Alina smiled right away, but Drew didn’t look up. He was holding that stuffed rabbit again, the one with the long ears and the missing eye. His hoodie sleeves nearly covered his hands. On one foot, he wore a red sneaker, and on the other had a grey sock with a brown stain on the heel.

“You dropped something?” Sarah asked, trying to lighten up the mood.

Alina stepped forward, her eyes not leaving Sarah. “Drew dropped his shoe.”

“Oh no,” Sarah said. “Where’d it go?”

Alina tilted her chin upward, toward the small square window at the end of the. “It fell out. I think it went straight into the dumpster.”

Sarah kneeled to their level. “Oh no. We should go and get it,” she held out her hand, “Right?”

Drew didn’t answer, but Alina did. “Yes, we should.”

The pitch of her voice increased, holding onto Sarah’s hand.

“What about you, Drew?” she asked.

Drew's fingers tightened around the ear of the rabbit. Without saying a word, he walked closer to Sarah and held onto her cardigan.

“Amazing then,” Sarah said. “Let’s go get your shoe.”

“Wait, I just remembered something,” Alina said quickly. “The lid of the dumpster is too heavy. We tried, and it was buzzing too. Like it’s full of bees.”

Sarah raised an eyebrow. “Bees?”

Drew’s mouth pressed into a thin line.

“He’s afraid of them,” Alina whispered, like it was a secret too fragile for the hallway to hear.

“I’m not,” he mumbled. This was the first time Sarah heard him speak.

Sarah glanced at the trash bag in her hand. She was already heading down there anyway. “Okay,” she said. “Let’s go.”

Alina followed quickly. Drew stayed behind for a second, then walked after them. His sock made a soft sound against the floor. He didn’t say anything.

Outside, the dumpster was behind the building, under a tree that had lost most of its leaves. The lid was closed but wasn’t locked. Sarah grabbed the edge and pushed it open. It smelled worse than she expected. She could hear the buzzing sound from inside, followed by a shallow bang hitting the wall. She looked at the twins, covering her nose and mouth with the sleeve of her cardigan.

“Stand over there. Alina, protect your brother so that he won’t get stung by bees.”

Alina nodded, holding her brother onto her chest. Sarah moved closer to the dumpster, one step after the other. She could hear her heart throbbing as if she were anticipating the worst. With one blow, she nudged the lid open with her elbow and peered in.

Immediately, a swarm of flies escaped the dumpster, catching Sarah with immense surprise. Behind the flies were two bats, followed by four cats. She gestured her hand, trying to purify the air before throwing her trash out.

“Drew,” she called gently. “What colour was the shoe?”

He looked up for the first time, eyes wide and a little too still.

“Red,” he said. “With a star on the side.”

Sarah nodded, and there it was, sitting neatly on a flattened cereal box, right on top like someone had placed it there instead of tossed it.

“You’re a lucky one,” she said. “Almost like it was waiting for you.”

She reached in and grabbed it, brushing off some dirt that clung to the sole. “Here you go,” she said, handing it back.

Drew took it, but his hands were cold. Too cold for a sunny afternoon in March.

She opened her mouth to ask if he was okay, but Alina had already taken his hand again.

“Thank you,” she said sweetly. “We have to go now.”

Then, just like that, they were halfway across the parking lot, their shadows trailing behind them.

Sarah wiped her hands on her jeans. The smell from the dumpster still clinging to her. She stood there for a moment, unsure whether to go straight back upstairs or take a walk around the building first. The air felt better away from the dumpster, anyways.

Near the fence, something caught her eye. A stack of old newspapers had been left on the bench beside the maintenance door. Most were faded or water-damaged, but one was open and dry. She walked toward it, thinking maybe someone had been reading it on a break.

The headline was simple, printed in a box near the bottom,  
**Couple murdered in Apartment. Children still missing.**

She paused. The paper wasn’t dated, or maybe the top half had been torn off. The photo beneath the headline was black-and-white and slightly blurred. Two adults, a man with short hair and a woman with her hair tied neatly at the back, no children. The article was short, maybe two paragraphs, but the words *unsolved* and *no witnesses* stood out.

Sarah flipped the page over and found nothing else about it. No follow-up, no names, nothing.

“Old news,” a voice said from behind her.

She turned and saw the janitor. She’d seen him before, early mornings, pushing a mop bucket through the lobby. He wore the same grey cap every day. The kind that never seemed to come off, even when it rained.

“Sorry,” Sarah said. “Was this yours?”

He shook his head. “Been sitting there all week. Kids sometimes bring junk from the bins. Half the stuff out here comes from people who never really left.”

She didn’t know what to say to that, so she nodded and looked back at the paper.

The janitor leaned against the bench. “You just moved in?”

“Yeah. Three weeks ago.”

He made a small sound in his throat. “That’s about when they start showing up.”

She looked up, unsure what he meant, but he was already walking off back to the side door with his gloves tucked in his back pocket.

She looked at the photo again. Something about the woman’s face felt familiar. She folded the page and slipped it into her back pocket, thinking maybe she’d read it later, when she had time.

As she turned to leave, she noticed something on the ground.

A small puddle had started to form near the dumpster. At first, she thought it was water, runoff from someone cleaning, but it was thick. It slid slowly from underneath the metal, moving in a line toward the fence, like it was following a crack in the pavement. She stared at it for a second. Then the wind picked up, tugging the edge of the paper sticking out of her pocket. Sarah walked away without checking twice.

Sarah was sitting on the floor, her laptop propped up against the coffee table. She had a half-written essay open and was halfway through typing a sentence when her phone buzzed again.

“Still not done?” Mia asked on the other end.

Sarah sighed. “No. I keep deleting things. It’s one of those prompts that looks easy until you actually start.”

“The one about moral responsibility?”

“Yeah. Which is ironic, because I’m seriously thinking about plagiarising now.”

Mia laughed. “You won’t. You’re too uptight.”

Sarah didn’t argue. She glanced at the time. It was almost six, and outside, the light had that washed-out look it got before the streetlamps came on. That’s when the knock came. Three soft taps, spaced too evenly to be casual.

“Hold on,” Sarah said into the phone.

She opened the door. Alina and Drew stood there, Alina with the same yellow dress and the same oversized hoodie. This time, the rabbit was missing. Drew was holding something else, an action figure or a little plastic soldier.

“Hi,” Alina said.

Sarah opened the door wider. “You can come in. I’m on a call, though.”

The twins stepped past her without hesitation and went straight to the living room. They dropped to the carpet and started sorting through the stack of crayons and colouring books she kept in the corner.

Mia was still talking. Something about her roommate stealing almond milk again. Sarah let her talk, half-listening and half typing.

It was quiet for a while. Just the soft scratch of crayons and the sound of Mia’s voice in her ear. Then something changed. The sound came in fast and loud. A scream, followed by a high, choked cry like someone was being dragged underwater. She could hear coughing or choking, like they couldn’t breathe. After that, someone started begging. The voice was scared and weak, like they were in pain.

Sarah stood up.

“Mia, hang on,” she said.

She walked into the living room.

The twins were standing at the window, side by side, looking out. They were laughing. Alina tilted her head back like something outside was funny. Drew was pointing, though his mouth didn’t move. Sarah looked outside but saw nothing. Just the parking lot, empty except for the usual cars.

Mia’s voice came through the phone, sharp now. “What the hell was that? Was someone screaming?”

“I don’t know,” Sarah said, trying to keep her voice steady. “I think it was the TV.”

“Sounded like it was in your room.”

Sarah didn’t answer. She stepped closer to the twins. Her eyes, glued onto their shadows on the floor, didn’t match what they were wearing. Drew’s silhouette showed him in shorts, not the hoodie. Alina’s shadow had no dress, it looked like she was wearing pants, and her hair was tied up instead of hanging loose. Sarah blinked. The shadows didn’t move the same either. Alina turned her head to the left, but the shadow turned right with a half-second delay.

“Sarah?” Mia said again. “You still there?”

She blinked again, looking down. The shadows were normal now.

“Yeah,” she said quickly. “Sorry. Thought I saw something weird.”

1mf72qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mf72qh/explore_farberware_yosemite_percolator_review_is/,Explore Farberware Yosemite Percolator Review Is This Classic Coffee Maker Worth It,"I wasn’t sure how a stovetop coffee maker like the Farberware 50124 Classic Yosemite Stainless Steel Percolator would hold up in my kitchen. I mean, I’ve grown accustomed to fancy espresso makers and programmable coffee machines, but something about its retro charm called to me. After weeks of using it daily, I have to say—this percolator is quite the throwback in the best way possible. However, there are definitely a few things worth noting for anyone diving into the stovetop coffee world.

**Design and Build Quality**  
There's something nostalgic about this percolator’s design. Crafted from durable stainless steel with a polished mirror finish, it brings a touch of vintage class to the kitchen. The glass knob on the lid is an iconic detail, and it’s surprisingly functional—it lets you see when your coffee starts percolating. I’ve had it on both my gas stove and an electric coil burner; it fits perfectly and remains stable. The handle is comfortable and stays cool enough to grip even when the pot’s been on for a while. But, if you’re short on counter space, storing this coffee maker might be a bit tricky due to its size.

**Ease of Use for Beginners**  
Coming from someone who’s occasionally brewed coffee in a French press, I thought this manual operation process would be complex. Turns out, it's really straightforward! You add your coffee grounds into the permanent metal filter basket—no messy paper filters here—and pour water into the base. Within minutes on medium heat, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the kitchen. However, gauging how long to keep it percolating for the perfect strength takes a bit of trial and error. My first batch was way too strong because I let it percolate too long, but by the third attempt, I was achieving a rich, full-bodied cup every time.

**Performance and Coffee Flavor**  
Let me be clear—this isn’t your everyday drip brewer. The coffee brewed in this percolator carries an old-school boldness. I noticed that it extracts a richer flavor from the grounds compared to my standard coffee machine. That said, if you’re someone who enjoys milder blends, tweaking the coffee-to-water ratio is essential. I tested it with a medium roast, dark roast, and even flavored blends—each came out tasting excellent once the ratio was right. There’s also minimal sediment at the bottom of the cup, thanks to the built-in filter basket. Who needs paper filters when this metal one works just fine?

**Advantages**  
- Heavy-duty stainless steel build ensures durability.  
- Permanent filter eliminates the need for disposable filters.  
- Dishwasher-safe (with exceptions) for no-fuss cleaning.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Can’t be used on induction cooktops, which might limit its usability for some kitchens.  
- The knob and pump tube spring aren’t dishwasher-safe, which adds a small inconvenience during cleaning.  
- Requires more attention during brewing compared to automatic coffee makers.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
When it comes to upkeep, I give this coffee maker major points for convenience. Aside from the knob and pump spring, the entire unit is dishwasher safe. After brewing, I found it easiest to give it a quick rinse under warm water before throwing it into the dishwasher. However, mineral stains did start building up in the stainless steel interior after a few weeks of usage, particularly where the water boils. A quick vinegar rinse did the trick to restore its shine. For someone who loathes scrubbing coffee machines, this percolator is refreshingly low-maintenance.

**Product Rivals**  
I did take some time to compare this stovetop percolator to other coffee makers in its category. The Presto 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker caught my eye for its larger capacity and electric operation. While the Presto offers convenience through automation, it lacks the charm and portability of the Farberware model. Another alternative I checked out was the Bialetti Moka Express. While the Moka pot excels at producing espresso-like coffee, its smaller capacity makes it less practical for serving larger groups. Between nostalgia, build quality, and practicality, the Farberware balances tradition and usability better than most.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Honestly, there’s something satisfying about achieving a great cup of coffee without spending heavily on high-end gadgets. While this percolator doesn’t have programming or fancy digital displays, it delivers consistent quality coffee. Considering the stainless steel build, the permanent filter basket, and the polished finish, this coffee maker feels worth every penny. Of course, its value does depend on your brewing preferences; it’s not for someone looking for lightning-fast brewing, but for those who enjoy the process—this is where it shines.

* Do you have alternating diarrhea and constipation, or just constipation? **Just constipation**
* Do you have nausea, vomiting, acid reflux, difficulty swallowing, or early satiety (getting full really early into a meal)? **Not really**
* Have you had this issue since childhood, or did it begin in teen years/adulthood/after a major life event? **From childhood, I've always had less frequent bowel movements and larger ones than others, but definitely exacerbated within the last two years**
* Did you in the past or do you currently take any medications that could damage your intestines? **Antibiotic – clindamycin**
* Did you suffer sexual abuse as a child? **No**

It feels like I've tried everything and I'm scared to add certain things like probiotics to just add more confounding variables. And they might hurt me more than help. The healthcare system is a complete disaster and only want to prescribe medication -- but I don't want to be on medication for the rest of my life. I want to figure out the root cause.

Here's a timeline of when I noticed things starting to get worse:

* February 2024
   * 23: Got a scrape on my elbow – didn’t think much of it
   * 26: Fainted in the bathroom in the morning, my elbow had red all around it and was hot to the touch. Went to the ER and they said if I had come any later, it could’ve been a case of sepsis. Got IVed with clindamycin. Was on clindamycin for the next two weeks without supplemental probiotics.
* May 2024
   * Started to get more into health and notice my symptoms more deeply. Realized I definitely was not having bowel movements as much as I used to, was straining on the toilet, and often having kernel/pellet sized poop
   * Fell into the routine of eating kiwis and drinking coffees to help
* July 2024
   * Lost my period
   * Somewhat disordered eating – was counting my calories and eating low fat, but still getting at least 1200 calories a day
* August 2024
   * Started tracking bowel movements on PCal
   * Went on a cruise, ate a variety of probably constipating foods, lots of just kernels
   * Visited first GI doctor who just prescribed Miralax
   * Blood tested negative for blood in stool and celiac disease
* September - November 2024
   * Started taking Miralax on and off, playing around with different doses
   * A month usually looked like this:
      * Two weeks of alternating days of no bowel movements or a few kernels here and there
      * A week of large sausages – as if the buildup from the past two weeks was just sitting in my colon and once my colon was full, then I would finally be able to go
      * The cycle continues
   * More stress during this time due to being in college
* December 2024
   * One week without any bowel movement for 6 days in a row
      * 2 regular bowel movements over a week and a half apart
   * 30: Viome test with some notable scores being:
      * Methane Gas Production Pathways (8/100) → this is actually what led me to want to get SIBO tested
      * Salt Stress Pathways (15/100)
      * Ammonia Production Pathways (21/100)
      * Uric Acid Production Pathways (26/100)
      * Biofilm, Chemotaxis, and Virulence Pathways (36/100)
      * Flagellar Assembly Pathways (36/100)
      * Bile Acid Metabolism Pathways (23/100)
      * Butyrate Production Pathways (31/100)
      * Putrescine Production Pathways (23/100)
* February 2025
   * Started progesterone pill as advised by my gynecologist → triggered my period
      * I also get period poops, so that helped a bit
      * Naturally got my period for the following two months following the induced one
* May 2025
   * Lost my period again
* June 2025
   * Moved to a new state where I don’t know anyone for an internship
   * Started educating myself more on constipation and knowing the consequences, which definitely triggered some health anxiety
   * 20: Got really anxious about not going for a while and tried liquid magnesium citrate (one bottle) at around 4pm
      * Triggered a bowel movement 16 hours later (which I think also signals some slow motility issues)
      * Didn’t cause a huge urge but I was going throughout the day
   * Started seeing a dietician to look into an elimination diet to see what are my trigger foods
      * Started low FODMAP for around 4 weeks → realized it did not have much of an effect on my bowel movements which makes me think it’s not a diet issue
      * Started logging what I was eating every day
* July 2025
   * 15: Took a SIBO breath test
      * Lactulose stimulated a bowel movement
      * Turns out I have methane SIBO with a spike of 17ppm at 160 minutes in and 18ppm at 190 minutes in
* Things to Note
   * I now supplement with ginger (550-1100mg/day) and mag glycinate (100mg/day)
   * I get really anxious when I don’t go for a while because of what I’ve learned it could cause – more bacterial overgrowth, impaction, ER trips → affects my sleep
   * I’m leaning towards this being a motility issue exacerbated by methane SIBO and potentially other pathogens??
   * I’m doing a stool culture and ova + parasite lab corp test soon but need to poop first to do so…

Date: July 27th

San Francisco Marathon 

Time: 3:27

A Goal-3:30-Yes

B Goal 3:40-Yes

C Goal Finish-Yes

Training-Didn't follow a traditional plan (HH, Fitz, etc.) but I did have a running coach-ish helping me scale my miles, and give me workouts to do. Averaged around 45 miles throughout the block, with a 62m peak. Consistently ran 6 days a week, with the odd cold, or just trying to listen to my body where I did 5 days/week. Training always had some type of interval work on Wed, and tempo on Friday, Long run on Sunday, Monday was rest, T/TH was easy Z2. 

Pre-Race-did a 4 day carb load. Did a 3m tempo at GMP 4 days before the marathon, rest were just 2 or three miles that week. Day of: Woke up at 3am (easy to do because I was nervous/anxious). I was in a hotel with wife and two kids, so I slipped on my kit, and went to the lobby with my bagels/PB/Honey and banana. Watched some of Clayton Young's Paris build while eating/coffee/salt-electrolyte drink. Tried to shit, failed, went on with it lol. Jogged 1 mile to the starting line, blah blah blah boring stuff. 

Race: Started in a slower corral because my OG goal time was 4:10. This didn't bother me much, as it actually helped my pacing/mentality because I was passing people the whole race. Running down the embarcadero was surreal, because it's such a busy iconic street, running on it with no one driving there was really cool. I made sure I didn't go faster that 7:50, which was easy because my legs normally take awhile to wake up. 

First hill/6-10-the fist hill I took really conservatively heading up to the GG Bridge. This was all part of the plan, chill on uphills, and let gravity do its job on downhills. My pace going up was around 9:00. Going up and over the bridge was amazing, It did get crowded at points, but when talking about 26 miles, I don't think it affected my time at all. I underestimated how much down hill there was after the GG bridge. Hip started hurting on the downhills. 

Big hill and miles 10-16-oof. Mile 12 leading back up to the bridge was the first test for me. HR finally got up to 160+, but kept my pace around 9:00. It was here that I found a gal that looked really strong, and I just stuck to her for really the rest of the race. Thank you to her! The climb up to GG Park was also brutal because it was a bit of a slog, and no one really talks about this climb as much as they do mile 12. GG Park was beautiful. 

Miles16-22-Kinda a blur tbh, but I saw my wife and kids at mile 22, and I needed it so badly. By around mile 20 I knew I had a good shot at 3:30, which I thought was just a pipe dream for my first one, I forgot that it's never just 26.2, and that extra couple tenths take a lot. 

Miles 22-finish: I sent it. My hips hurt, my toes hurt, but the rest of me was fine, and I knew that I had to get after it. I finally passed the gal I was tailing and gave her a fist bump, and kept going. At the finish line there was some tears, because I just love the Bay Area so much, and to run this as my first was really special to me.
