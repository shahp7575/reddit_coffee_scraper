I have a good job, a nice place, and I'm in decent shape, but I'm lacking genuine connections.

I moved here for work about 10 years ago, and while I've built a career and comfortable life, I never figured out the friend part. Time flew by, and now I find myself with plans to celebrate my birthday... alone (Wife is going to in-laws for the month).

 I enjoy reading sci-fi, can hold conversations about anything and make a mean filter coffee.

Looking for people around Chennai (I'm in Tambaram).  Just genuine people to share conversations and experiences with.

If you're in a similar boat or have a group that wouldn't mind a new face, drop a comment or DM. I promise I'm not as awkward in person as this post might suggest. Well, maybe a little.

1kq4q47,https://i.redd.it/nd4lgaxclo1f1.jpeg,Is it worth learning Cinema 4D in 2025?,"Is Cinema 4D Still Worth Learning in 2025?

Spoiler: Unless your dream is to animate potatoes in 4K… Yes. Yes, it is.

 So, You Wanna Animate Cool Stuff?

Let’s set the stage: It’s 2025. AI is designing logos, TikTok is teaching people quantum physics in 30 seconds, and you—yes, you—are thinking,
“Should I still bother learning Cinema 4D?”

Short answer: YES.
Long answer: YEEEEESSSSSS.

But let’s break it down, stand-up style, shall we?


 The Blender Bros and the C4D Crowd

You’ve got two types of 3D artists in the wild:

The Blender Bros — free-spirited, open-source evangelists with 12 YouTube tabs open and a dream.

The C4D Crew — seasoned motion magicians who treat their viewport like a Michelin-star kitchen.


Now, Blender is like dating someone fun and spontaneous who lives out of a van.
Cinema 4D is like marrying a luxury interior designer who owns the van… and made it look like a spaceship.


 “But Isn’t Cinema 4D Expensive?”

Yes. And so is sushi. You still eat it because it’s worth it.

C4D is what happens when a 3D tool and After Effects get married and raise beautiful motion graphics babies.
It’s seamless, it’s powerful, and it’s trusted by agencies that spell “design” with a silent “gh.”

Sure, the subscription cost makes your wallet weep softly in the corner. But guess what?
Clients pay for quality.
And Cinema 4D artists don’t just animate—they elevate.


The Industry Loves C4D Like Boomers Love LinkedIn

Broadcast graphics? Cinema 4D.
Product animation? Cinema 4D.
That one super-satisfying 3D loop you stared at for 15 minutes instead of answering emails?
Yeah. Cinema 4D.

Studios still rely on it for one simple reason:
It works. Beautifully. Reliably. And fast.
Which is more than I can say for most coffee machines in co-working spaces.


---

Finale: The Motion Designer's Crystal Ball

Look, AI may eventually write your emails and draw your cat in a Renaissance toga.
But when it comes to high-end 3D motion graphics with professional pipelines,
Cinema 4D still sits on the Iron Throne—with MoGraph tools in one hand and Redshift in the other.

So if you’re thinking,
“Should I learn Cinema 4D in 2025?”
Let me respond with another question:
“Do you want to get hired, paid, and praised?”

If the answer is yes…
then yes, my friend.
Start animating those potatoes.



Cinema 4D in 2025?
Still kicking. Still sleek. Still the Beyoncé of motion design software.

Cue fade out. MoGraph explosion. Applause from digital crowd.

I am looking making new friends, if you find interesting, message me.

I enjoy cooking for peace of mind, used to like hiking trips(looking forward to resuming this hobby). I enjoy swimming and taking long walks. I try to survive this life with coffee. I sometimes watch/re-watch anime , or listen to audiobooks or useless podcasts in weekends to pass time. Exploring new food/cuisine excites me more than watching a movie.

I currently don't have any pets, but love to adopt a cat some day.

I enjoy cooking as a hobby , I'm definitely not a professional. But I got into it as it reminds me of self value and consistently put efforts to improve myself. It's ok if it sounds a bit boring, but this particular hobby helped me a lot with my anxiety issues and making a routine.

Just for starting conversations, I am writing these questions, feel free to ask me anything that fancies ya.

How do you handle this world in times of self doubt , as everything is tuned towards repelling introverted people?

What is the last time one of your friends pissed you off and how did you handle it?

Share two happy moments in the past month.

If you're looking for a safe space where both people can feel heard and enjoy each other’s company, let’s talk!



P.S. preferably near my age or adults

After sending the message, my fingers shook so badly I almost dropped the phone. Inside the room, their conversation kept going.  
  
“Is this fair to Briar?” Gladys’s voice trembled, laced with a rare hint of guilt. “If it weren’t for the unborn baby, she might’ve ended it all. Watching her so lost, barely eating and living—it’s heartbreaking.”  
  
Elliot signed, as though the weight of his lies was finally pressing down.  
  
“But Carmilla’s only got six months left,” he said, voice tight. “It’s her last wish, Mom. I can’t just walk away.”  
  
“And Briar?” Gladys pushed. “She’s carrying your child.”  
  
“I’ll make it up to her in the future.” he said. “ Don’t worry,mom.”  
  
My heart felt like it was being crushed, the pain instantly radiating through my entire body until I could barely breathe.  
  
I stumbled back to my bedroom, knees buckling beneath me as I crumpled onto the floor.  
  
My phone vibrated. Conor.  
  
“What’s going on, Briar? Is everything okay? Elliot’s… he’s dead, right?”  
  
I opened my mouth to speak, but the words wouldn’t come. Instead, tears poured down, hot and blinding. The world knew Elliot Sterling was dead.  
  
But I knew better.  
  
I understood Conor's confusion. Even I couldn't have imagined Elliot would fake his death, let alone that he'd do it for another bitch.  
  
Though I said nothing, my brother seemed to sense my emotional state. After a long pause, he spoke softly.  
  
""The day after tomorrow evening. I'll send a plane to pick you up then.I’ll take care of everything else.""  
  
After hanging up, I remained frozen in position, still holding the phone.  
  
Just then, a gentle knock came at the door. Standing outside was Elliot's ""older brother""  
  
Or rather, Elliot Sterling himself—holding a glass of warm milk.  
  
""Hey, Briar, what’s going on? Why are you sitting on the floor like that? Have you been crying? You... you must be missing Elliot, huh?""  
  
During the weeks since Elliot had returned as his supposed brother, he'd been incredibly kind to me, seemingly treating me as his deceased brother's widow.  
  
Countless times when facing his concern, I'd felt lost my mind.Gladys always attributed this o grief over losing Elliot.  
  
I discreetly locked my phone screen and forced a smile.  
  
""It's nothing.The baby kicked me and I lost my balance for a moment.""  
  
Elliot visibly relaxed, setting down the milk before carefully helping me up from the floor.  
  
""That little troublemaker.Wait until he's born—his uncle will teach him.""  
  
""Come [on.Here](http://on.Here) some milk for you. Drink it and take a break. Elliot wouldn't hope for this situation.""  
  
Hearing him mention his own name, I finally couldn't hold back anymore. I looked directly into his eyes and deliberately asked  
  
""Tell me the truth. Are you Elliot Sterling""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Elliot froze for a moment, then laughed softly as he gently brushed my hair.  
  
“Briar, you’re exhausted,” he said, his tone dripping with fake concern. “Why would you think I’m Elliot? That’s crazy.”  
  
""Tomorrow’s your prenatal checkup. I’ll take you. You need rest.That's my brother's only bloodline in the world. I'm going to make damn sure that baby arrives safely.""  
  
I lowered my eyes, unable to stomach the fake concern in his gaze.  
  
""Just go. I’m exhausted.""  
  
Only after the door clicked shut did the tears I'd been holding back all evening finally come flooding out.  
  
Elliot and I met at a college party.He fell for me at the freshman party.and pursued me.  
  
Two years after graduation, he gave me the most extravagant proposal.  
  
I still remember that night—the fireworks reflected in his eyes,but his eyes even more brighter than the fireworks.  
  
While planning our wedding, I discovered I was pregnant. Elliot had been overjoyed.  
  
“Perfect timing,” he whispered, pressing his forehead to mine. “Our baby came for celebrating our wedding. Briar, dear,I'm the happiest man alive right now.”  
  
I still can't wrap my head around it. Six years together, and he throws it all away,faking his own death just to bail on our wedding.  
  
Early the next morning, Elliot knocked on my door.  
  
“Briar?Time for your prenatal checkup. You ready?”  
  
But just as we were about to leave, Carmilla's voice called from behind us.  
  
“Elliot, baby, I’m not feeling well.Could you stay with me today?”  
  
At the sound of her voice, Elliot didn't even glance my way before rushing to her side.  
  
“What’s wrong, sweetheart? You should be resting.”  
  
Then he turned to me with a quick glance.  
  
“Sorry, Briar,my wife’s not feeling well. James will drive you to the hospital.”  
  
“James is outside, he’ll take you. I already called to Dr. Wilson. He's waitting for you. Just go straight over there.”  
  
I closed my eyes, trying to hold back the tears threatening to spill.  
  
When I opened them again, I didn't miss the fleeting look of satisfaction on Carmilla's face.  
  
Without a word, I nodded and walked out, closing the door behind me with a dull [thud.My](http://thud.My) hand unconsciously stroked my belly as heavy tears finally fell.  
  
James got me to the hospital on time, and I completed all the scheduled tests.  
  
Elliot had previously instructed both the driver and doctor—if I didn't show up, he would become suspicious.  
  
I sat in the hospital waiting area, staring at the blurry ultrasound picture. Just a tiny blob on the grainy black-and-white image.  
  
The doctor had pointed at it, smiling ""See that? That's your little one.""  
  
But I couldn't bear my kid has a father who kept a side piece!  
  
I wiped my face with my sleeve and made a quick call to schedule an appointment at another hospital.  
  
This was the Sterling family's private hospital—if I had the procedure here, Elliot would definitely find out.  
  
I texted James: 'Just going to grab some coffee and take a walk. You can go ahead and leave.'  
  
Waiting until his black sedan pulled away,I hurried to the curb and went to another hospital.  
  
My phone buzzed just as I was signing the consent form for the abortion. A video message from an unknown number.  
  
The video was thirty minutes. In this video, Elliot did no-holds-barred sex which I'd never seen Elliot out of control like this.  
  
For six years, he had been Mr. Considerate in bed, and he worried that I would get hurt if he was too rough.  
  
Turns out he wasn't naturally restrained in bed. Who can meet his appetite is someone else.  
  
I forced myself watch the video, torturing myself with every second of seeing a side of Elliot I never knew.  
  
I don't know how long I sat there before a nurse approached me.  
  
""Ms. Briar? Are you alright? It's time for your procedure.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I couldn't stop crying as I watched the video, even my hand holding the phone couldn't stop shaking.  
  
The worst part? I still loved that bastard. Even after everything.  
  
I couldn't just delete him like a bad Instagram post.Six years. Six goddamn years. Loving Elliot was like breathing—it just came naturally, even now.  
  
Everyone always said Elliot was obsessed with me, but they never saw how I'd saved every movie ticket stub from our dates or how I'd memorized his coffee order by our third date.  
  
Six years together....and only now.  
  
Remembering the rapid little heartbeat I'd heard during the check, I wiped away my tears and took a deep breath.Give the last chance for my baby and Elliot.  
  
Then I called him.  
  
""Elliot, can you come to the hospital? I… we need to talk.""  
  
His voice came through weirdly breathless. ""I'm kind of in the middle of something. Just Uber home and we'll talk there, okay?""  
  
""Oh god, Elliot, harder…"",with a soft moan the call disconnected, leaving just the dial tone.  
  
I'm not a kid, I knew exactly what he was doing.  
  
I looked up at the nurse hovering nearby.  
  
""Well,let’s do it.""  
  
It was after dark when I got home. The second I stepped through the door,Elliot came striding toward me.  
  
""James said you went around. What'd you buy?""  
  
Then he clocked my puffy eyes.  
  
""What’s wrong? Briar.Did you cry?what happened? About Elliot?Oh,The baby you're carrying belongs to Elliot,at least a comfort ""  
  
""What was this thing you wanted to talk about me?""  
  
I stared at his face—that perfect jawline, those eyes that still made my crazy.  
  
The same eyes I'd just watched in vedio from Carmilla.  
  
""Never mind,” I said, forcing a weak smile. “Just checking if you needed anything.""  
  
He practically deflated with relief.  
  
""You should get some rest,” he said, “You look… rough.""  
  
I just nodded and bolted for my bedroom.  
  
I fell asleep almost instantly, my dreams taking me back to college—freshman Elliot with his floppy hair and that vintage Nirvana t-shirt.  
  
""Briar Collins, I've had a crush on you since day one. Will you date with me?""  
  
""Don’t worry, I’ll treat you right.""  
  
Maybe it was the golden sunset making everything magical, or maybe it was the sincerity in his eyes that I couldn't resist.  
  
Somehow, I ended up saying yes.  
  
I woke up to sunlight streaming through the blinds. First decent night's sleep I'd had since learning of his ""death.""  
  
I was still sitting dazed in bed when my door was opened and Carmilla came in.  
  
""Wanna know why I sent that video? Still think Elliot’s some doting brother and I’m just your sister-in-law?""

1kq4n8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kq4n8r/we_broke_up_after_3_yearsburnout_financial_strain/,"We broke up after 3 years—burnout, financial strain, and losing our beloved pet.","Hey everyone, I have been lurking in this Reddit group for a long while now and I’ve been carrying my own story and figured I’d share it here for some perspective, clarity, or even just peace of mind.

I (M, late 20s) went through a breakup not so long ago with my girlfriend (F, also late 20s) after almost 3 years together. We met through mutual friends from school, started as a casual connection, and eventually became serious. I lost my virginity to her, and in many ways, she became my first true love. We have been through the usual ups and downs as a couple and we have supported each other in many ways that have healed us - emotionally and spiritually. We have grown with each other and falling in love with her was a special moment in my life. She was just doing something that is just mundane - her usual quirks when it comes to ordering her favorite food and coffee. She has specifics and is very particular with her tastes - I think it was when we were eating in the car and she just opened up this vulnerable and feminine side of her that her walls just broke down to reveal her inner child to me. I felt special and honored that she was open to love after her messy situation with her ex years ago. From that moment on I was dedicated wholeheartedly to her and I knew that she loved me deeply too

The relationship had both depth and difficulty. She was studying when we first got together, and I was already working in a corporate setting. Over time, I financially supported her through two board exam attempts, dorm living, supplementary classes, pre-employment needs, and even emergencies involving her pet. I willingly did it—not out of obligation, but out of love. To give some context to her family side, but I would not say too much because I still respect her privacy and sensitivity when she opened up about her relationship with her family to me. I knew her relationship with her family, especially her father, was strained. Financial-wise, they have supported her through school, but after graduating, it is like, do what you want.

I understood her situation and I had a lot of savings and she had savings as well. But, we both understood our grounds when it comes to paying and saving for our respective important stuff. This is very important to her and I reassured her throughout the relationship that it is okay for me to splurge for her and knowing her backstory and relationship with her parents. I was touched when she was able to provide me with her gifts during my birthday and anniversary. And yeah, her gifts were “budget-friendly” and thought it wasn’t enough, but for me, it was everything. She gave me flowers too, which I want to have and as a man, it is very special because I wasn’t given flowers so it was very touching.

But as time went on, things got heavier. She struggled to keep her jobs—leaving two of them after less than a month due to burnout, toxic coworkers, and commute fatigue. I understood it to a degree (she has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression), but financially, it started to overwhelm me. I was juggling responsibilities for my own retired parents, our bills, work pressures, and everything in between. My salary was going to two households—hers and mine—and slowly, I began to burn out.

In March of this year, both our pets got sick. Her cat had stage 4 kidney failure. Mine had liver issues. I was spending a lot on vet bills, on top of everything else. During this time, I was also trying to meet high-pressure deadlines for a major event at work and many project deadlines. The emotional and financial weight broke something in me. But I truly believed in my girlfriend. I thought hard to myself that once I become regular in my new job, she gets another job and mental health rest, and praying that everything will be okay. She was going to me after work and ranting to me, which I had no problem with because we were both talking to each other about our days throughout our relationship. Ranting our life’s frustrations and everything. We were each other’s shoulders to cry on, and a safe space to listen and hug after a long day. But, during her second job, it was getting frustrating that she keeps calling me sometimes during my work at lunchtime and messaging me during the times I am very busy. I told her to call me later when I needed to work because it was a crucial meeting or situation on my end. I established my proper boundaries because it is a valid reason on my end that we would talk to each other at the end of the day and comfort each other.

I sat down with her after the event to calmly talk. I told her everything—not with blame, but with honesty. I said I loved her, but I needed help. That I was struggling too. I asked her to please try her best in her next job, not for me, but for herself and her cats. She understood and reassured me. That was two weeks before we broke up.

Then, a few days later, her cat's health declined again. We rushed to the vet. The bills were steep. I was visibly frustrated—not at her, but at the timing, at life. I said things I regret now. I was tired. I, I hugged her, as a way of saying sorry for the frustrations and reassuring her that everything is okay before dropping her off. She sank into my arms and then I tried doing our usual banter, but my heart wasn’t in it. She tried to kiss my cheek, but I didn’t give it immediately. It was a knee jerk reaction based on what I was feeling at the moment and what I have been feeling for the past month. She asked, “oh, so no kiss?” and then went sad for a bit, then I gave in and allowed her to kiss my cheek. That night, she told me she wanted to take a break from our relationship. I didn’t fight it. I respected it. I said I’d still be there in case of emergencies.

Three days later, she messaged that her cat died. And then, she said, “Let’s break up.”

What followed was a long exchange where I tried to stay calm, even as she told me things like:  
“You don’t need to complain about the money anymore, she’s dead.”

“I don’t need your savior complex.”

“I’m just dragging you down.”

“We’re not in love anymore—we’re just settling.”

“I used to imagine a future with you. I can’t anymore.”

I told her I still loved her. She said she loved me too—but it was over.

We ended things with care. I told her I’d always be around if she needed me. We exchanged soft goodbyes. She even reacted with a heart emoji when I said I’d still be there *as her best friend*.

Since then, we’ve had light, occasional conversations. She recently told me I’m the only ex she can “tolerate,” and we’ve slowly reconnected in group chats and memes. It’s fragile, but peaceful. I’m trying to respect her space while healing on my own.

But it still hurts. I miss her. I still love her and pray for her. And I’m not sure what to make of everything that happened.

**TL;DR:**  
We broke up after a long, loving but financially/emotionally exhausting relationship. She ended it shortly after the death of her cat. We’ve remained on civil, friendly terms, but I’m still struggling to process the grief, guilt, and weight of it all.

If anyone’s been in a similar situation—of loving someone deeply but reaching a point where it breaks down from pressure—how did you handle it? How do you carry love while letting go?

so i[22M]’ve been liking this girl [20F] for a while now, she owns a coffee shop with board games. from october til now, we were a little more friendly, not texting or anything, but we had some conversations and even sometimes, me and my friends played with her and her mother some games in the shop.     

now when it comes to texting, it happened a little. about early January, i texted her twice about music (the topic we used to discuss), second time i felt she kinda shut me off, and didn’t text her again. fast forward late february, i replied to a photo of her “cute” and she said “thank you”. late march we had a small texting about music also from a story she shared about it, etc details.      
last 2 times i texted her, were late march, i replied with a heart to one of her stories, she liked the reply, and yesterday i replied with heart eyes, she left me on read. keep in mind in this period of time (2-3 weeks before today) we were playing a game with her and her mother.

some signs i got were:    
•she usually charges for board games if we didn’t order anything, that rule doesn’t apply to me and my friends for some reason.    
•her friends (or people close to her) did tell me (in february) if i have a girlfriend and why i don’t try dating her.

so, should i move on or what should i do?

I felt so warm and loved. I'm feeling really positive and happy for the day ahead. I always buy other people things like this but today somebody did it for me! I expressed so much gratitude and let them know how much it means to me. Maybe life isn't so bad after all.

That person was me. I bought myself the coffee.

I got out of bed early for a morning walk, some upbeat music, and I did those things for myself.

I realised that in all my friendships and relationships, I fawn the most for people that 'do things for themselves'. Be that in their fitness, career, holidays, self-talk, boundaries and expression of needs. I admire that quality in them and I want it for myself. I am drawn to these people and I fall in love with them.

They also fall in love with me, or keep me around because I people-please and devote all my energy to them. I feel good about myself when I show them loving acts but I get resentful when so much time passes without me getting any unprovoked reciprocation. I hate myself most when I don't do the things I want to do for myself such as just showering.

What if - what if I people pleased myself. It's hard to do when you don't realise that live is in the actions to yourself. Love is doing all the things I do for others for myself.

When I treat myself this way, I took will be attractive to people that are givers.

Love yourself the way you desperately try to make other people feel loved. 'Self-love' isn't what you tell yourself is love, it's your own love languages that you try to give to others.

Have a great day everyone! I hope you all do one nice thing for yourself today :)",1,1747634665.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

I’m a woman in my late 20s and have been living in Bangalore since 2019. Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to have a great group of friends who made the city feel like home. But life happens — many of them have moved abroad, relocated to new cities, or drifted into different life phases. Lately, I’ve found myself at a bit of a crossroads, feeling the absence of those deep, day-to-day connections.

As I’ve grown older, I’ve realized that making new friends — especially meaningful ones — isn’t as easy as it used to be. I’ve also found that I relate more easily to other women at this stage of life, where career decisions, personal growth, mental health, family expectations, and even just finding joy in the everyday — all take center stage.

I’d really love to build a small circle of women friends who are open to meeting up, having real conversations, supporting each other, and maybe even exploring the city together — whether that’s grabbing a coffee, catching a play, trying a new restaurant, or simply sharing stories and laughs on a weekend walk.

If you’re someone who also misses female friendships, is new to the city (or not!), or is just looking to rebuild your social circle with genuine people — feel free to drop me a message or comment below. I’d be happy to connect!

I met this girl when I was 15 on an online game, she was pretty much my first love and my first everything, we had a pretty intense relationship for around 4 years, and I never met her in real life. Yes, it was a long distance relationship. We eventually broke up, she started dating another guy and that broke me. I left the country and moved to the other side of the planet, I unfollowed and we never contacted again, it took me 2 years to get over her. A few years later she followed me again, we talked a little, no feelings, that was it.

Fast forward a few years and I get in a relationship and she sends me a message saying "" It hurt me a little but I'm glad you're happy"" I said thank you and we never spoke again. In 2023 I went home to see my uncle that was sick and was going to pass away, she saw my stories and asked when was I going to go see her, we talked a little and she sends me nudes. Obviously we didnt meet because I was in a relationship so I left the country and silence between us happened again.

A year later my partner and I broke up unfortunately, a few months passed and I was still really upset so I went home for a few weeks to see family, thats when she messages again when she saw I was in her city. I though maybe we could go have a coffee and chat a little, talk about all the years as we are now 30yo adults. We were supposed to meet but she said she was busy with work and wouldnt be able to see me. I was a bit upset my moved on.

Now we started chatting a little more, but its never a consistent conversation, sometimes we go days without messaging. The other day our conversation got pretty hot and she sent me nudes and saying what she was gonna do to me and that she regrets not seeing me when she had the chance, then she tells me she doesn't want to fall in love with me again. That were times before she said she never gave up on us but also she doesn't seem interested at the same time?

I was deeply in love with her when I was a kid and we never even met in real life and now chatting with her again, I feel it might be sparkling something, but im not sure. Is she feeling the same and afraid of reigniting her feelings for me and thats why she suddenly pulls back? I just feel really curious because I think I want to know how it really feels to hug and kiss her in real life, I feel like I need a disclosure about this feeling I had so we can finish once and for all or we might end up together and is the best thing ever.

So, is this an unresolved feeling or should I just move on? Is she feeling the same way?  ",1,1747633863.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I really thought that he would pursue me after getting intimate with him on the 2nd date, and that’s not a plan I expected to do with him which I regret now(i came from a 4 year relationship before meeting him) He decided that we were exclusively dating that time as I asked what are we after having the deed.

and then when we had misunderstanding, he just leave me hanging after without any clarity for like a week, after that no contact, I was the one who ask for the clarity if he ended things with me (fucking stupid). No response, but that should be the answer, however he still views my stories on ig. I tried to be unbothered so i didn’t unfollow him as well. I literally trust him, and genuinely liked him so I left a little hope that he would come back. He didn’t.

After 2 days of that misunderstanding moment, I found out that he has now a new girl who he talks on his main ig account, and found that we were talking only on his 2nd ig account. (He has 2 ig which me and the new girl didn’t know about). There’s no overlap, but there’s no fucking closure. He got 2 days as he replaced me with a younger girl. He still followed me on ig but i decided to block him after knowing that bs. Is that how older men really behave on this generation? No accountability, consideration and respect on giving at least clarity? He acted so mature that I put my trust on his fucking bs. I just can’t accept that he fucked me over and fucked up my life that I had trauma meeting new men now, and he even denied to his new girl that we had sex since he didn’t finish? Who tf gaslights his girl like that? Maturity never comes with age yes, but he is really a good narcissist who sucks younger women, and I hope he gets his karma for treating me like shit.

1. **Removing myself from the moldy environment** \- Completely moving out of the mold made the biggest difference on my health. I discarded the majority of my belongings as well. If that is not financially feasible, spend as many hours a day outside of the moldy location as possible. Go for walks and do not work from home (e.g., instead work outside or in a local coffee shop, library, or co-working space). I also invested in high-quality air filters, which I think prevented me from getting even sicker. 
2. **Supplementing for deficiencies** \- I take magnesium, iron, and vitamin D supplements as well as a methylated B-vitamin complex (if you have the MTHFR gene mutation, you need the methylated version). Have your doc run the lab work to identify your specific deficiencies and then supplement accordingly. Your body will thank you! I also take SBI Protect to improve my gut health, and drink nettle tea, raspberry leaf tea, and turmeric shots (in moderation because turmeric is sometimes lead-contaminated). 
3. **Eating lots of whole foods** \- I cut processed foods and sugar out of my diet. I eat lots of meat, vegetables, fruits, and nuts. I aim for low-oxalate veggies to avoid stressing my body during detox. I also avoid foods that are known to have mold contamination (e.g., peanuts). I rarely eat gluten, but I do still have some dairy in my diet. 
4. **Spending time in nature** \- Getting fresh air every day has been paramount to my healing. Although I am now living in a mold-free place, I still spend as much time outside as my schedule allows. You will also get some natural vitamin D from being outdoors. 
5. **Promoting nervous system healing** \- I try to encourage my body to remain in a parasympathetic nervous system state as much as possible with practices like mediation, yoga, deep breathing, and regular acupuncture sessions (covered by my insurance). You can find nervous system healing meditations for free on YouTube. Acupuncture has made a HUGE improvement in my pain levels and overall symptoms. 

Your life is worth living, and there is hope for healing. Every body is unique and it takes some trial and error to find what works for you, but you are worth it! ",0,1747633739.0,ToxicMoldExposure,0,0.5,False

We worked for a year and a half and ended up becoming good friends. We would walk home together, hang out, and I occasionally went to his house to watch movies. I did fall in love with him early on, but he ended up dating a girl from my friend group (that lasted only a couple months), so I didn’t make a move for a couple of years, after they had broken up. When I did make a move he declined me nicely, and I had to weigh up whether the friendship was more important to me then the rejection and I decided it was, he was still my best friend, and we had been through a lot together. In all honesty it took me a while to get over him, lots of tears and a few bad choices.

 For the next 9 years we both lived our own lives, dated other people, I had a child, he moved away at one point but ended up back in the same city as me again. We both still caught up in person at least once a year over this period and messaged each other often. Admittedly if we both were single at the same time again, I would wonder if I should make a move again, but then something would happen, and I would again make the decision to not look at him that way and continue just being friends.  About 3 years into this time gap, I met and started dating my ex (38M). I truly believed we would be together forever and this was it, I had finally found my forever person and life was good. I had told my Ex about Nate early on, and about our history and he said he trusted me, and it was fine. We got engaged and built a life.

I won’t go into too much detail about my ex. We had a fairly good relationship until we hit the 6-year mark, and then I started having doubts. I wasn’t happy and until this point I guess I thought our problems were normal couple problems. It came to a head when my mental health tanked from all the controlling and my depression, and all he could do when I tried to talk to him about it was shrug and make some stupid joke. He tried telling me this was his way of coping with stress but knowing that didn’t help when I was crying and wanted to kill myself and needed him to just be supportive. All of this stress and sadness made me realise I didn’t love him anymore, not like I used to, and made me question if he loved me at all.

I knew I couldn’t live like this anymore or I would do something dangerous to myself, so I started making arrangements to get out. I called Nate, and we caught up over coffee while my son played. I told him some of what was going on and asked if he thought I should leave. Really, I just needed the push to let me know I was doing the right thing. He didn’t say I should leave but told me about his similar experiences and that gave me comfort that I was doing the right thing. At this same meet up he told me how he was looking for a new job. I had just signed onto a farm my sisters partner owned, and I told him he should apply too as they needed a part time cover.

Fast forward a few months and I am moved out and living on the farm I am working on with my son, and Nate has also moved into a house on the sister farm next door. At one point with house shuffling, we lived together for a month, but it was completely platonic, we had separate rooms. We hung out like we used to after work, watched movies and played card games. I was trying to work through stuff with my ex but for all the talk, nothing ever changed. I was also very transparent about Nate working with me and the fact that we lived together for a bit but told my ex ‘you don’t have to worry about Nate, we are just good friend’s’. I told him I wasn’t in the frame of mind for a relationship atm, which was true. I genuinely believed Nate and I would never end up being a couple, and tbh it was even on my mind at this point.

  It became apparent there was no saving the relationship with my ex and I stopped going around to visit or stay the night. A few months after this, and approx. 10-11 months after the breakup, Nate and I started to become closer than just friends. We did start sleeping together and it crossed over into more of a situationship, since we hung out so much and had started sleeping together. During this time the tightly bottled emotions I had tied down for years came flowing out again. After this had been going on for six months, I decided enough was enough, I couldn’t have a noncommitted relationship with someone I felt so strongly about. I gave myself 3 more days to pretend it was all okay and then I was going to break it off. The same night that I came to this conclusion I arrived at his house to stay the night (my son was at a friend’s house for a sleepover) and long story short, to my complete surprise, he asked me out!

  Now we have been dating for a year, which I know isn’t that long, but I have never been happier. Our communication is amazing, we love each other so much, it is better than I ever thought it could be. We do have arguments of course, and disagree about things, but we always come back together afterwards and work it out. We actively listen to what each other has to say. It feels like we have been together for longer because we already know each other so well.

  My ex (who still sees my son) had a go at me a few weeks ago about how I had run off with the guy who I said never to worry about and asked how long I had been planning the whole thing. I do feel really bad about how it looks, but that isn’t what happened. Am I the a-hole?",2,1747633687.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

One thing that always has me stumped is on medium roasts, my shots tend to start off slow, then go extremely fast about 6-7 seconds into the shot. I'm using an IMS basket, WDT etc. I dont have any of these issues with my darker roasted coffee but I do believe it has something to do with the temperature stability of the machine. It also happens with Sugar Cane decaf which I believe also likes a slightly higher temperature than water processed decafs. Its so bizarre to me. Does anyone know how to get around this?

1kq4914,https://www.reddit.com/r/WegenersGPA/comments/1kq4914/subglottic_stenosis_saddle_nose_deformity/,Subglottic Stenosis/ Saddle nose deformity,"I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis (narrowing of the trachea due to scar tissue) in 2021 at 16 years old after 10+ years of shortness of breath that suddenly advanced to the point of me barely being able to walk/ navigate stairs during my junior year of high school. It was miserable—by the time I was diagnosed I was essentially breathing out of a coffee stirrer. 
After a few dilations with which the stenosis promptly reoccurred within weeks, I underwent a larngotracheal reconstruction and a graft from my rib cartilage was used to make it wider. It was supposed to ‘cure’ the condition or at least least give me a break for a decade or so. The recovery was brutal, 16 days in ICU over the summer between my junior and senior year of high school and an eyesore of a scar that I have on my neck to this day.
It took only 5 months for the scar tissue to reoccur. A handful of dilations followed but after at least a dozen or so my doctor kind of took a step back and referred me to rheumatology. 
The first question they asked was “has your nose always looked like that?” (Ouch lol)
Looking back at old pictures I can say, no, it has not always looked how it does now. It is very stubby and round at the end, the bridge of my nose is pretty flush with the rest of my face and my face in general is pretty flat. I also had had a nose bleed almost every single day for probably 4 years by that point, and had just started to cough blood up on a regular basis so I quickly received my DX of GPA. Looking back, it was so obvious and I wish I could have been diagnosed sooner.
I was put on Methotrexate but the months following until the medication began to work were miserable. Unreal fatigue, SOB, coughing up blood clots, and my nose bleeding heavily daily. I often found myself just standing over the bathroom sink and letting it flow out because there was nothing I could do to stop it. 
Finally, the methotrexate began working. I felt like a normal person in my early 20s and was able to resume my very active lifestyle for a little over a year. I had an appointment lined up with a facial plastic surgeon for a consultation to reconstruct my nose and have even discussed with my rheumatologist weaning off of medication completely due to being in ‘remission’. 
Recently though, I feel the scar tissue in my throat reoccurring. Just two months ago I was running miles every day and going to the gym 6x a week and now I am getting winded just dressing myself. I have been going through huge and stressful changes in my personal life and I don’t know if the stress was a contributing factor but I feel so defeated—like I am back at square one. 
So frustrating as well that I am sure I will have to majorly postponed any sort of nasal reconstruction. As a 21 F it is maddening walking around with the nubby nose that I have lol.

Curious if anyone has experienced similar? Have any of you been able to take Methotrexate long term? 

If you also have a hx of subglottic stenosis, have you experienced reoccurrence of scar tissue independent of a GPA flare?

Cómo Instalar NOD Antivirus\
\
So, you've decided to go with NOD Antivirus? Great choice! Getting it up and running is pretty straightforward, but let's walk through the steps to make sure everything goes smoothly. I remember the first time I installed an antivirus, I was so nervous I'd mess something up, but trust me, it's easier than you think.\
Pasos de Instalación\
Okay, first things first, you'll need to download the installer. Usually, you get this from the official ESET website after you've purchased your subscription. Make sure you're downloading from a trusted source to avoid any nasty surprises. Once you've got the file, here's what you do:\
\
Double-click the installer file. This will kick off the installation wizard.\
You'll probably get a prompt asking if you want to allow the app to make changes to your device. Click ""Yes"".\
Follow the on-screen instructions. This usually involves agreeing to the license agreement and choosing your installation preferences.\
Pay attention to the options during installation. You might be asked if you want to enable certain features, like the anti-theft feature. Think about what you need and select accordingly.\
Wait for the installation to complete. This might take a few minutes, so grab a coffee or something.\
\
Configuración Inicial\
Alright, NOD Antivirus is installed! Now, let's get it configured. Usually, the program will launch automatically after installation. If not, just find it in your start menu and open it up. Here's what I usually do:\

Activate your license. You'll need your license key, which you should have received when you purchased the software. Just enter it when prompted.\
Run a first scan. This will give you a baseline of your system's security. It might take a while, so be patient.\

Be careful what you click on. Phishing emails and malicious websites are still a major threat. If something looks suspicious, don't click it.\

1kq450h,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kq450h/my26f_husbands26m_friendf_keeps_crossing/,"My(26F) husband's(26M) friend(?F) keeps crossing boundaries and causing fights, yet he is still friends with her.","This has been an extremely contentious subject in our marriage (married 2 yrs, together 8yrs) for the past few months. Some context, my husband (26 trans M) has been in military reclass school for the past 5ish months while I (26F) have been holding it down at home alone. We will call this friend Amanda (trans F). I'm unsure of how old she is, but she seems to be around our age. Amanda and my husband were introduced d/t their similar circumstances when he arrived at the base. They hit it off fast, especially with the state of politics in the US and the military trans ban leading to them leaning on each other. 

Now, I was very happy for him to have this friend for a while, and thought it was good for him until about a month into their friendship. Amanda revealed that her wife consented to an open marriage, and then proceeded to proposition my husband. My husband kindly but firmly shut it down, and then told me about it immediately. Amanda did not accept this rejection well and continued to make comments/jokes for the next few days, things like how it would ""enhance their friendship"". It got to a point that he had a frank and firm conversation with her that her comments/jokes had to stop or they couldn't continue the friendship.

To Amanda's credit, she stopped.....for a time. Between this first concerning event and now, various things have happened (all of which I have been informed about promptly by my husband). Nothing quite to the extent of outright propositioning him again, but actions which have made me, my husband, and any of his or my friends uncomfortable to hear. A few that come to mind are: good morning and good night messages daily, gifting items upwards of $50 without reason, showing up at his morning coffee place daily once she realized that he was there every morning, getting drunk and making sexually aggressive jokes towards him while playing video games together, whispering things into his ear that could have been spoken outloud, hugs that have lingered for too long. 

Essentially, there is a pattern of about 4ish weeks. Amanda will do something that makes him uncomfortable enough that he has a discussion with her and tells her to knock it off. She is good for about a week or two and then starts back up again for weeks 3/4. It seems to me like Amanda isn't getting emotional fulfillment in her own marriage and is using my husband to fill that role. This obviously makes me exceedingly uncomfortable. Now I don't believe in ultimatums in a marriage, and I know that she is a friend who my husband relies on a lot. They are both going through the same issues with the military, and I work nights as a nurse, so I am asleep most of the time that he is awake. He sees this person as a positive in his life and credits her as the reason he hasn't fallen into a depression. 

I have never once asked him to cut Amanda out of his life; I have asked for reasonable boundaries or behavior changes. However, a few days ago, something one of his guy friends said finally clicked in his head, leading to him deciding to cut her off on his own. Unfortunately, something happened last night after an event involving both my husband and Amanda that was quite traumatic. I won't get into it here, but this event caused them to begin speaking again, and they ""trauma bonded"" (my husband's words). 

While discussing whether this meant he would continue to communicate with Amanda, we got into a fight. He got angry when I said I cared about Amanda ""as much as one human should care about another human"" but that I didn't care about her emotions regarding my apathy towards her. He began to yell, which caused me to get emotional and cry. He got angrier and said some things that he now says he regrets, as did I. He went to bed, I went to work, but now I don't know what to do. I don't want to cause my husband any pain, but I really think this is causing a serious strain on our marriage. What would you guys do? 

Additional info: There is no doubt in my mind that my husband hasn't and won't cheat on me, let alone with Amanda. Our time apart will be ending in about a month and then he will be coming home and won't be interacting with Amanda in person anymore. 

TL;DR: my husband's friend asked to sleep with him, he said no. She continues to cross boundaries but he wants to remain friends. What do I do?",0,1747633074.0,relationships,1,0.5,False

He gets uncomfortably close, leaning in toward your face.

Isaac: ""I make four billion cookies a day. I've flooded the market so much that cookies are cheaper than water, now.""

It's not like it's a serious issue or anything—we laugh about it all the time. But outta nowhere, he got really upset, like seriously defensive. It baffled me because he’s usually super chill.

It got me wondering... could there be something deeper going on? Maybe it isn't really about the comment itself, but more about feeling like he's expected to change when he’s not ready? I can imagine that might trigger some inner fears, like not being good enough or feeling pressured to be someone he's not.

And I guess we've all got our sensitive spots—those hidden layers we don't even realize are there until they're poked. Maybe something like this hits a nerve tied to past experiences, like times when he felt judged or like he didn’t measure up. It's just speculation, but it feels like there's more under the surface that he might not even be aware of.

It’s a huge relief, especially considering how bad things can get during the monsoon in our Namma Bangalore.

That said, it’s heartbreaking to see so many other parts of the city submerged and struggling. It’s always the usual suspects, Balagere, Varthur, Gunjur, ORR. 

Saw the Silk Board Metro station flooded as well in news media.  Every year it’s the same story — roads flooded, traffic chaos, homes damaged.

It’s high time our local leaders like Brand Bangalore self appointed custodian Sri DK Shivakumar and BBMP chieftains took long-term city infrastructure more seriously. We need better drainage systems, regular maintenance, and sustainable planning — not just patchwork fixes. Enough of concretisation of our roads and other infrastructure. 

Bangalore deserves better. Hoping to see more accountability and proactive efforts from our elected representatives.

How exactly can we make the people who govern the city smell the coffee and wake up from their deep slumber.

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 2 years. We are in our early 20's. A couple months ago, I messed up. I went on a vacation with my two best friends and one of my best friends boyfriends. I'm close friends with him and have been even before they began dating. 

Basically, we got drunk, and from what I was told because I don't remember was that we were being 'too friendly' and touchy. 

Things changed after that. My best friend forgave me and told me that she knows I had no ill intention and that I need to do better. My boyfriend gave me a second chance and that he did not find that whole situation as cheating. 

But these past months, our relationship has changed. It became distant. I became emotionally unavailable because that trip has altered me. I've been struggling with self sabotage, negative thoughts and self hatred. This has been affecting my relationships. 

And i've talked it out with him. He had emotionally cheated because he had gone to get coffee with a girl from school and found himself liking the idea of starting a new relationship with a new girl.

Mind you that I'm 20, and I have strict mexican parents. So no sleepovers, no going over to his apartment, and no vacations together. 

Those are all things he wants but I can't offer because i'm dependent on my parents and can't afford to become independent. 

Basically, we made up and now he wants to continue our relationship. The issue now is that I can't stop thinking about breaking up. We are mutual on the fact that we have no future together. Our dreams and aspirations are completely different. And I just believe that he deserves someone who can sleepover, someone he can see everyday (we live qbout an hour away from eachother), someone he can go on vacations with, someone who can love themself and now be emotionally unavailable. 

But I love him so much. He's willing to work out relationship... but am I? What is the use of continuing a relationship that doesn't have a future? I understand enjoying what we have, but i'm a soft hearted person and this breakup will hurt a lot whether it's now or later.

There is a lot of negative reviews on Facebook about her specifically. The events have mixed success rates as far as traffic goes. I ignored the negative reviews and took a gamble on the event traffic, hoping it'd be great. It was not.

From what I can figure out, Sandi's specific gimmick is this:

1. Call herself an event coordinator and slap a company name on her ""business""
2. Reserve an event facility, like a casino, hotel banquet room, or barn
3. Solicit vendors to pay a $50-100 booth fee and fill as much of the space as she can
4. Use this money to cover the fees of the rental
5. Anything that's leftover, use some for minimal advertisement on Facebook
6. Pocket the rest
7. On the day of, put out a handful of plain a-frame signs that say CRAFT FAIR, attend the event with limited instructions and interactions to the vendors, set up her three booth spaces (including a mobile coffee stand) in a prime location, hand out 50 free gift bags\* (which include items donated by the vendors), and sell her stuff.
8. Never check on vendors
9. Sell overpriced coffee drinks to the vendors, any visitors (the more the better, but not necessary since the vendors are built-in customers to buy coffee and pastries), and collect 100% profits from sales as she has no booth fee to cover
10. When vendors wise up to her ""business"" and never attend again, it doesn't matter as there are always new vendors popping up (including MLMs) who are willing to spend $50-100 and gamble on an event

I did one event with her. It was an epic failure, and she was not a pleasant person to work with. If her events ever have good traffic, it's likely a complete accident and has little to nothing to do with her influence. 

I want to be clear that she is NOT operating a scam. It was a legitimate event and she is a legitimate person--it was just legitimately terrible. She runs poorly advertised and poorly executed events because she has no interest in the actual success of how anyone does, as she will be successful regardless.

Just a fair warning to my other Washington crafters and artists. Her events are awful and not worth the gamble.

This all happened in the span of a month but it sent my world spinning. It was my first relationship in a big city living alone for the first time. Things started quickly with talks of marriage, where we’d live, “I love yous”. I was hesitant about intimacy and compromising time for school, he told me understood fully. 

First, it was watching me scroll through social media and asking why I viewed a male classmate’s Instagram story for “so long”. Then, it was accusing me of spending too much time on a zoom call with a male classmate that “clearly” had a crush on me; I was consoling him about his cat that passed away. Soon, he requested he look through a text conversation with me and another classmate. I felt wrong giving him my phone but I did because I had nothing to hide. The conversation was solely about school and he has a wife. However, my ex criticized me for putting a heart emoji. This whole conversation was before I ever met my ex. My ex soon shifted his focus to my best friend. He would feel upset I told her the same story I told him. 

Simultaneously he had a female friend he’d meet every morning to talk about person things. They had inside jokes that I was confused about and they would meet up without me almost every day. One day she invited him for dinner and I happened to be there when she called. He asked her if I could come too. The dinner was spent with her talking about meeting his parents and I hadn’t yet. Me and her partner stared at each other lost about their jokes. When I expressed my concern he told me I was the jealous one, not him. He offered for me to look through his phone and to never talk his female friend again. Neither of which was a solution I wanted. 

I wanted to wait for intimacy since it was my first time. He started off understanding but quickly escalated. He would pull up my top without permission, take off his clothes, put his penis on me, and try to touch me. I’d frequently be pushing him off to avoid sex. He would say his penis hurts if he was hard without sex. One night he tried to get on top of me, I started to tear up. He got off of me and cried saying “you’re just not attracted to me”. Near the end of the relationship, he pushed me on the bed and walked away saying I was always a tease because I flirted but didn’t want to be intimate. My friend told me if I stay, she is so scared what would happen. 

I realised the urgency and told him I needed to meet. When I told him my concerns somehow he’d swing it back to me. My mind felt foggy and I apologised for everything to keep peace. I knelt on the floor crying and trying to hug him. He pulled away coldly and sarcastically said “this must be so traumatic for you”. He was angry I told my friend and mother about things, he said “now they hate me”. I once confided in him about my traumatic upbringing and relationship with my father. He told me “I knew you’d be difficult because of your father, but I chose to love you anyway”. 

I knew I had to get out and the next day texted him to break up after class. He initially didn’t want me to explain like I offered. However, I got strings of texts in the next month about meeting me for coffee. When I said no, he’d switch to calling me selfish, ruining his life, and making him want to quit medical school. He confided in his female friend the night we broke up and spent the night in her apartment talking about me. I thankfully blocked him, deleted his number and cut him off forever. 

This was years ago. I’m lucky to have met an amazing, kind and gentle man who’s everything I wanted and more. He’s healed me in ways I’ve never thought possible. I went to therapy. I was recently at graduation and saw him with a woman. I was told by a mutual friend they’ve been dating for over a year. I worry for her wellbeing and I guess it brought up some old feelings regardless of the healing I’ve done.

Healing isn’t linear. Most days I feel fulfilled and proud of my decision. Other days I remember how I was treated and feel sorry for myself. Then I feel guilt for still thinking about it. Regardless, leaving isn’t easy even years after, but one step at a time. 

TL;DR: I left an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship years ago. Healing has not been linear, especially after seeing my ex again. But I’m proud I left and found someone loving and kind.",1,1747631714.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I don't race road anymore so it doesn't matter except for fast group rides.  It's actually heavier than my canti boone but still has great snap on the hills. Super comfortable for longer rides.

For reference, I ordered a set of ACE pedals on Nov 30th, then about 3 months ago when the R1s were announced, I upgraded my order to the Falcons. I also recieved the damper kit.
 
my takeaways so far: 
 
-Packaged very well and included a virpil coffee cup as a bonus. Nothing missing or broken
 
-As of now, the ""manual"" is an easy to follow assembly post on the Virpil forums. No printed instructions. The instructions doesn't discuss anything beyond assembly. This could be way better. An assembly and usage video would be great.
 
-no tools included which is slightly annoying, but not a surprise based on other posts from Virpil products.
 
-Assembly was straightforward
 
-Very high quality construction and materials
  
-The locking USB connector is cool
 
-Adjusting the pedal angle is tedious due to limited access to back nuts holding bolts in place
 
-installing the damper requires using a tape measure to set the location of the retaining ring. It seems like a simple mark or sticker would have been easier
  
-damper and friction adjustments work well and I set it to feel fairly heavy which feels realistic to me, but I'm sure isn't the best for DCS dogfighting. I used the default spring instead of the included extra soft spring. 
  
-it slides easily on my smooth floor with medium tension, damping. I installed rubber floor pad from my weight room under the pedals and they stay put
 
-I fly IRL often, have my commercial cert and have flown a variety of aircraft. I tried to set up the pedals to have a realistic spacing, resistance, damping, brake resistance and pedal angle. I was trained to put my heels on the floor when in the air and so far I'm struggling to find a comfortable position with these pedals with my heels on the floor. I've set the angle at the most extreme vertical angle, but I can't get it to feel quite right. The pedals feel too high off the floor. I'm sure that I'll probably get used to this.
  
-I like the default brake resistance. It's a little soft compared to IRL, but it's good.
 
-i find that the damper prevents the pedals from self centering perfectly, it doesn't bug me too much though 
    
-the pedals needed a firmware update right away, but it was easy to do. And no issues with the calibration in the Virpil software 
  
-i find that the pedals and brakes need a dead zone adjustment and setting the axis was kind of challenging in FS2024 because they were jumping around so much the wrong axis would get selected. But after some adjustments, it works will in the sim.
  
- I haven't tried DCS yet.
  
-my go to test is a heavy cross wind with a light tail wheel airplane and I have to say they fly really well. Dancing on the pedals felt natural and I could easily make subtle adjustments. The pedals feel a bit big and sliding up to the brakes from the ""heels on the floor"" position feels awkward for me. I'm assuming that the intent is to always fly full footed on the pedals which isn't what I do IRL.  Pedal spacing feels best to me at the smallest space.

We are renting a car and were planning on sharing the driving, but now with his license lost I am now set to be the sole driver for a long stretch over several days, with at least eight hours of driving on one day with very little wiggle room for breaks in a country where we can’t predict any adverse road or traffic conditions. (And yes, it is becoming increasingly certain there is no way he can conjure up a valid acceptable license in time for the rental.)

While I admit a part of me is a bit pissed about the nature of his losing the license / how he manages his belongings (irrelevant separate story), even understanding full well that this was an unintentional accident, I still feel like the fact that I would be driving way more than I have ever driven in one sitting before, being at higher risk for exhaustion / general discomfort / errors in driving, and also missing out on enjoying the scenery warrants at least some sort of gesture like offering to pay more for gas and caffeine.

But a day passed after he told me about it, and when I spoke to him again, he still didn’t even offer any gesture. So that’s when I directly asked him if he could spot more of the gas money and pay for caffeine refuels and grub. It got a little awkward as he agreed and said that’s how he always treats friends who he’s riding with. I give him the benefit of the doubt because we’d been pretty good friends for a while, but the fact remains that it took my prompting on our second conversation; whether he would’ve offered the gesture otherwise we’ll never know.

Am I overreacting / being too petty? I want to emphasize that it’s not about penny-pinching the restitution value of my inconvenience, but rather just on the principle: if it were me inconveniencing a friend, even unintentionally, I would’ve apologized and offered to treat him to some sort of meal or drink and definitely gas money. And I do think I gave him a chance to offer himself since I didn’t bring it up in our first conversation, hoping he’d say something.

Also, to clarify: I’m not asking if I’m overreacting in to how my friend agreed to my request—he already agreed—I’m asking if I’m overreacting in making the request itself.",1,1747631466.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

I am a W2 employee at a big tech, and I’ve been working for about 5 years. Recently, I started to realize corporate isn’t really for me. I hate the idea of doing something that does not serve anyone. I feel like a cog in a machine and  im building something that doesn’t really make this world a better place. Corporate meetings, kissing up, and being dependent on my job scares me, and I want to get out of this rat race.  I’ve been reading a ton about acquiring a small business and starting an e-commerce business, but I’m not entirely sure where to start. I was wondering if there’s someone out there who’s willing to mentor me and help me get started on this entrepreneurial journey. I’m particularly interested in laundromats, coffee shops or any e-commerce business. 

[What I can offer]
I understand that you may not have any incentives to help me. So this post might seem silly. But I am willing to work and I can help in any ways. If you are in LA, I can help out for free on weeknights and weekends. I might not have much to offer, but I do work in advertising and I know how ads algorithms are built. As a small return, I can help run a marketing campaign effectively, digitalize any manual process, or automate any manual processes. I understand that what I’m offering is minimal and most people won’t take up the offer. But wanted to make this post just in case there’s one person out there who is willing to mentor and save me from my mundane, seemingly depressing, and sad corporate job.

""I'm really sorry, boss. I'M REALLY SORRY!"" **shouted the tallest man, who had a quirk that made him look like a muscular tiger and possessed many cybernetic parts.**

Nana and Toshinori looked at AFO in fear. His face wasn't visible or anything, just his ruby-red eyes, as red as blood or the most expensive wine you could ever see in your entire miserable life.

""...did someone ask for your opinion? Seriously, did someone ask for the opinion of the dyed blonde? You're not fooling anyone, your hair is brown, not blonde, stop thinking you're special."" **AFO says as he gives Toshinori a blonde dye job.**

""Actually, he didn't kill anyone... there's just some crazy guy out there pretending to be the boss... and we're looking for him,"" **says one of AFO's allies, who looks like a jellyfish.**

""...wait, so who's the other one?"" **Nana says.**

1kq3m8w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kq3m8w,INCORP - Zheluyons First Hivemind State,"Introduction

Incorp is a Corporate Hivemind State that spans across all three discovered zones in Zheluyon. Founded my a man named David Stalenhag, Incorp is a very unique country. (Some don’t even consider Incorp a country at all, but we’ll get to that.)

Incorp functions less as a country and more like a business. Imagine if Amazon gained independence. Thats essentially what Incorp is. It sells all sorts of products and services on a global scale, all the way from simple coffee mugs to war mechs, Incorp has it!

Neurolens

This is all due to the revolutionary tech called the Neurolens. Which is a headset given to the Worker Class of Incorp.

The Neurolens is a revolutionary device that is placed on top of one’s head. The Neurolens then sends electric signals to the brain that instruct them what to do. No silly human thinking required. The Neurolens is usually put onto Workers to work at maximum efficiency. Working fatigue is no longer a problem, reaction time is faster, and obedience is to a maximum. 

So how does the Neurolens communicate with the brain so fast? And how do Neurolens’s communicate with each other. Simple! It uses an entirely new ultra-fast language called Chromacommunication. Hinted at by the name, this type of communication doesn’t use words, but it uses colors. You see, there’s trillions of different colors, making it extremely easy to make entire complex sentences or even entire paragraphs condensed into a single ultra specific color. The Neurolens AI can easily tell the difference between extremely similar colors, so this Chromacommunication makes things really easy. Something like “I just went to the store today to get pulp-free orange juice and ran into an old friend of mine.” Could be condensed into one of the trillions of colors, or any variation of that sentence. Even a simple hello has its own color. 

The Various Classes of Incorp

High Class (Corperate Government)

The High Class is the richest and most wealthy you can go. These people rule and govern the government as they please. They were the founders and engineers of the Neurolens. Making them “the CEO’s” of Incorp.

Middle Class

Despite what the name of this class tells you, the middle class people are still decently wealthy. The middle class is usually sub-business owners under the Incorp umbrella. They are in charge of smaller things like food management, education management, etc. in specific sectors. They’re essentially the managers for Incorp. Look at it like this, fast food chains have restaurants, and these restaurants need managers to make sure the workers are doing their job. That’s what the middle class is. They’re the managers.

Worker Class

The Worker Class houses the Workers (no duh). The Workers are the people who use the Neurolens’s most of the time. They work long shifts and do various different jobs. They do mail services, engineering, all the different jobs you would expect in a civilization. But due to the Nerolens’s, the jobs the Workers do are at maximum efficiency. The work hours are insane to a normal persons prospective, and how well the Workers do their job is better than what any normal person could do. Once again thanks to the Neurolen’s. However, due to the Worker Class normally only being seen as moneymaking machines. They’re highly discriminated against and get payed little to nothing. 

More info

The motto of Incorp is “Freedom is a Cage, Ignorance is Knowledge, and Above all is Efficiency.”

Incorp by law is considered a Company but due to their large size and de facto independence, they’re mostly considered a country by the global community!

I am buying a first espresso machine for a friend’s birthday. At first I was thinking of the Breville Barista Express, but the grinder seems mediocre and I’m concerned about a built-in grinder.

For almost similar money I can get my friend a Breville Infuser ($513) and a grinder. I don’t want anything big because it would take up too much kitchen space. But the advantage of a standalone grinder is also that they can use it for coffee and not just espresso. For reasons of speed, shipping and convenience of retuning, I would like to get it on Amazon. 

For grinders it seems the Neretva grinder is $130
And the Baratza Encore is $199 and a DF54 is $250. I am leaning towards the last one. Any other candidates I should be looking at? I’ve watched James Hoffman’s under 250 video, but prices nowadays seem a bit different from in his video, at least in the US.

I’m also a bit confused because the DF54 seems to have different brands making it?

This all happened in the span of a month but it sent my world spinning. It was my first relationship in a big city living alone for the first time. Things started quickly with talks of marriage, where we’d live, “I love yous”. I was hesitant about intimacy and compromising time for school, he told me understood fully. 

First, it was watching me scroll through social media and asking why I viewed a male classmate’s Instagram story for “so long”. Then, it was accusing me of spending too much time on a zoom call with a male classmate that “clearly” had a crush on me; I was consoling him about his cat that passed away. Soon, he requested he look through a text conversation with me and another classmate. I felt wrong giving him my phone but I did because I had nothing to hide. The conversation was solely about school and he has a wife. However, my ex criticized me for putting a heart emoji. This whole conversation was before I ever met my ex. My ex soon shifted his focus to my best friend. He would feel upset I told her the same story I told him. 

Simultaneously he had a female friend he’d meet every morning to talk about person things. They had inside jokes that I was confused about and they would meet up without me almost every day. One day she invited him for dinner and I happened to be there when she called. He asked her if I could come too. The dinner was spent with her talking about meeting his parents and I hadn’t yet. Me and her partner stared at each other lost about their jokes. When I expressed my concern he told me I was the jealous one, not him. He offered for me to look through his phone and to never talk his female friend again. Neither of which was a solution I wanted. 

I wanted to wait for intimacy since it was my first time. He started off understanding but quickly escalated. He would pull up my top without permission, take off his clothes, put his penis on me, and try to touch me. I’d frequently be pushing him off to avoid sex. He would say his penis hurts if he was hard without sex. One night he tried to get on top of me, I started to tear up. He got off of me and cried saying “you’re just not attracted to me”. Near the end of the relationship, he pushed me on the bed and walked away saying I was always a tease because I flirted but didn’t want to be intimate. My friend told me if I stay, she is so scared what would happen. 

I realised the urgency and told him I needed to meet. When I told him my concerns somehow he’d swing it back to me. My mind felt foggy and I apologised for everything to keep peace. I knelt on the floor crying and trying to hug him. He pulled away coldly and sarcastically said “this must be so traumatic for you”. He was angry I told my friend and mother about things, he said “now they hate me”. I once confided in him about my traumatic upbringing and relationship with my father. He told me “I knew you’d be difficult because of your father, but I chose to love you anyway”. 

I knew I had to get out and the next day texted him to break up after class. He initially didn’t want me to explain like I offered. However, I got strings of texts in the next month about meeting me for coffee. When I said no, he’d switch to calling me selfish, ruining his life, and making him want to quit medical school. He confided in his female friend the night we broke up and spent the night in her apartment talking about me. I thankfully blocked him, deleted his number and cut him off forever. 

This was years ago. I’m lucky to have met an amazing, kind and gentle man who’s everything I wanted and more. He’s healed me in ways I’ve never thought possible. I went to therapy. I was recently at graduation and saw him with a woman. I was told by a mutual friend they’ve been dating for over a year. I worry for her wellbeing and I guess it brought up some old feelings regardless of the healing I’ve done.

Healing isn’t linear. Most days I feel fulfilled and proud of my decision. Other days I remember how I was treated and feel sorry for myself. Then I feel guilt for still thinking about it. Regardless, leaving isn’t easy even years after, but one step at a time. 

TL;DR: I left an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship years ago. Healing has not been linear, especially after seeing my ex again. But I’m proud I left and found someone loving and kind.",2,1747630869.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

Staying hydrated can get boring, but the Cirkul water bottle makes it way easier and more fun. You just fill it with water, pop in a flavor cartridge, and twist a dial to get the flavor strength you want. No powders, no mess, just flavored water on the go.

There are tons of flavors — fruit, tea, coffee, even caffeine options — and the best part is they have zero calories and no sugar. Plus, it’s reusable, so it cuts down on plastic waste compared to buying flavored bottled drinks.

If you’re thinking about trying it, starter kits cost about $30 to $40 and come with a bottle plus a few flavor cartridges. You can also subscribe for regular deliveries and save some money. Some of my favorite flavors are Mixed Berry and Fruit Punch.

Voice is back, mostly, but I still have constant issues with heartburn and sore throat and a pain in my chest that feels like that heart attack I knew I would eventually get. 

Between the COVID, the laryngitis, and a stress fracture, I haven’t run in almost two months. My depression is at full blast and I’ve put on even more weight. I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been. And now with (probably) GERD, it’ll probably be even longer. I kinda just want to let it kill me.

It doesn’t matter what I eat or drink, I put on weight and/or get heartburn and chest pain. And now with my one remotely effective exercise option basically gone, it’s only going to get worse. 

I got put on pantoprazole a few weeks ago but I don’t think it’s improving anything. I’ve cut down on coffee (I’m a teacher, so I don’t think a complete cutoff is ever likely to happen), I’ve slowed down eating…fuck, I’ve even tried baking soda in water.

But we would love to find a content creator/photographer early in the process, who can be with us for the long future. 

The main thing we are looking for is someone that can go with us to events and networking socials occasionally, photograph us and help us with social media presence and potentially social media marketing! We can care less that you are not someone with a filled out resume, just a person with passion for startup and willing to work in a team!

Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested!! We can hit up a FaceTime call or meet up at a coffee shop to talk about our plans and visions!",2,1747630405.0,Charlotte,7,1.0,False

Transcript:



There’s something magical about lighting. It sets the mood, shapes the atmosphere, and has the power to transform even the most ordinary moments into something extraordinary. That’s exactly what happened to me when I started leveling up my space with smart lighting from Govee. I didn’t just brighten up my home, I brought it to life.



It started with a single room. I wanted to give my workspace a little boost, something to break the monotony. I installed a smart strip light and, boom, it felt like I’d entered a whole new realm. The colors danced to my playlist, shifted with my mood, and suddenly, I was more motivated than ever to create, edit, and dream bigger. That little glow wasn’t just for aesthetics, it became my fuel.



Soon after, the lighting expanded. My living room, kitchen, bedroom, even my backyard. Govee’s smart ecosystem gave me control at my fingertips, syncing my space with the time of day, energy levels, and even my weekend vibes. Movie nights became full-on theater experiences. My morning coffee came with a sunrise glow. Hosting friends? Govee’s ambient lighting turned get-togethers into full-blown light shows. The transformation wasn’t just visual, it was emotional.



What surprised me most wasn’t just the tech, it was the connection. The way lighting could lift my spirits, soothe stress, or energize me through tough days. It felt personal. With each setup, I wasn’t just decorating, I was telling a story. My story. From cozy warm tones during quiet nights to bold neon splashes during gaming marathons, Govee helped me express myself in color.



Whether you're a content creator, a gamer, a parent, or just someone who wants to feel more connected to their space, Govee has something for you. Their lighting and smart home gear aren’t just functional. They’re fun, interactive, and made to evolve with your lifestyle.



Ready to spark your own transformation? Use my exclusive code GOVEEAI for 10% off your purchase at Govee.com. Dive into a brighter, more personalized world, and light up every part of your life, your way. Don’t just turn on the lights, turn up the vibe. With Govee.",1,1747630329.0,ProductShowcase,0,1.0,False

I only ever had one grinder, (oxo electrical conical burr) so I don’t really have a frame of reference or anything to compare it to. I understand that fines are unavoidable to some degree, but I’m not sure how much is normal and how much is a problem.

What should I be looking for in terms of grind consistency? Are there signs in the cup or during brewing that tell you your grinder is producing too many fines?

Thank you!

1kq3fc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1kq3fc6/secret_shoppers/,Secret Shoppers,"About half way through the shift, we had a customer walk into our café with laptop in hand. Our district has been sending in secret shoppers since our dresscode was implemented. I have never had a job be so god damn anal about a dress code but that's a different tangent. Anyway, he ordered a latte and made it so obvious he had been sent by the DM because he was peering around and checking the condiments station and trashes/ the state of our café.

To make matters worse, our closing crew was handed off a terrible midshift and we're severely understaffed. The cafe wasn't disastrously decimated but it was obvious we have not had the time to get to sweep and wiping down the tables. With the summer coming around, our store has become a lot busier and we do not have the staff to keep up. 

This man spent 3 hours in our cafe, observing us and writing up his report. He even asked me to turn down the music so he could attempt to eavesdrop on our conversations to see if they were appropriate. We all clocked that he was an opp the moment he walked through that door and he made it more obvious when my coworker witnessed him craning his neck while I disappeared under the counter to clean a shelf to see if I was on my phone or something.

He abruptly left when we were discussing the dresscode and the specifications when it came to our pants. No doubt he knew we were onto him and most likely made his report invalid in the process.

I have worked plenty of jobs and Im no stranger to secret shoppers. But it's unsettling for corporate to go to these extremes. I feel like Im in a totalitarian workplace where my every move is being monitored. It shouldn't be like this, we make fucking coffee for minimum wage.

One of my close friends, let’s call him Dan, came in for lunch. Nothing unusual—he ordered, we chatted a bit, I went back to work.

About 20 minutes later, I noticed Dan looking kind of stressed. Turns out he had parked in a spot with limited free time, and he completely forgot to move his car. Officers always were there.

Now, here’s the thing—we weren’t supposed to leave the floor unless it was an emergency. But I saw the panic in Dan’s face, and I knew it was an emergency for him.

I told my manager I needed a bathroom break, sprinted outside, and started chatting with the inspector. I played dumb like, “Oh, is this your car? I think the owner’s just grabbing takeout.” I stalled him just long enough for Dan to run out, move the car, and dodge a fine that could’ve cost him half his paycheck.

Came back inside, slightly out of breath, and just continued serving like nothing happened.

Dan still owes me a coffee for that one.

1kq3dfu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kq3dfu,Awkward wall but large space,"What I’m struggling with: 
1) what couches to purchase for this space 
2) where to place tv (currently in front of fireplace that has been decommissioned)
3) what else do I add? (Ottomans, coffee tables, etc..)

I was thinking of an L shaped couch. But I also don’t want it to look like a couch just stuffed in a corner…The half wall makes the room a bit of an awkward shape.  I was thinking the short side of the “L” would go where couch is currently, while the longer side stretches out past maybe the 2 set of blinds. (Basically where couch is at in photo). Was thinking an end table would finish off under the last set of blinds (where wicker storage bin is). I hope that makes sense. The short wall opening/cubby is a little over 8ft wide. 


There use to be a railing separating the kitchen from the drop down living room, but I just recently removed it to open up everything a little more. The large couch use sit up against the railing, but obviously with the railing removed, that placement no longer makes any sense. 

Also, just for reference, the tv used to be in the corner off to the side of the fireplace closest to the windows. 

I am open to all suggestions. Just want the space to look intentional and not too empty

Hi everyone. I’ve been debating whether or not to post this because I still don’t understand what happened, and I know how it’s going to sound. But maybe someone here has experienced something similar.

This happened last Friday.

I got home from work around 6:15 PM. Same routine: kick off my shoes, drop my keys in the bowl, heat up leftovers. Nothing felt off—until I walked into the living room.

Someone had moved the remote. Not a big deal, right? Except I always leave it on the armrest. It was on the coffee table. I brushed it off.

Ten minutes later, I hear footsteps upstairs. Not creaking, not pipes. Steps. Measured. Walking.

I live alone.

I called out, “Hello?” No answer. I grabbed a flashlight (no weapons in the house, I know, dumb) and slowly made my way up.

The hallway was empty. I checked every room. Nothing. But the bedroom door—my door—was shut. I always leave it open.

I opened it.

Empty.

Except… the closet light was on. I never use that light. It's dim and flickers. I pulled the door open—

And it was just… dark. Too dark. Like staring into a tunnel that went farther than it should. I felt this pressure in my chest, like something was about to step out.

But it didn’t. So I shut the door, turned off the light, and left the room.

Here’s where it gets weird.

Around 9 PM, I took the trash out. As I came back up the driveway, I saw someone leaving my front door.

It was me.

Wearing what I wore yesterday. Same build. Same walk. Same damn haircut. He—it—didn’t look at me. Just locked the door behind him and walked calmly down the street.

I ran in, locked every door, checked every inch of the house. No signs of forced entry. No one inside. But my closet light was back on.

I haven’t touched it since.

Now, every night at 9 PM, I check the front door.

And two nights ago, I swear to God, I saw myself standing across the street.

Just standing.

Watching.

I’m a final-year Bachelor of Psychology (Hons.) University student. For my final-year research project, I’m conducting a study to better understand how using online dating platforms—like Tinder, Bumble, or Coffee Meets Bagel—might be related to social anxiety.

Specifically, in this study, I’m exploring how engagement with online dating platforms (like Tinder, Bumble, or Coffee Meets Bagel) is related to social anxiety in young adults. I’m particularly interested in whether fear of rejection and upward social comparisons (i.e., comparing yourself to others who seem more attractive or successful) help explain this relationship.

Understanding these psychological processes could offer insights into how online dating affects mental well-being—especially for people in this age group.

You Can Take Part If You:

* Are **18 to 30 years old**
* You’ve **used an online dating platform** before in the last 3 months

Now, I am a thin person. I don’t think I was as skinny as I was in the height of the pandemic, but I wear an XS / S. I am not skinny but I am slim. 

My mom took me aside yesterday to tell me to work out more and to eat less. I have been actively doing that to monitor my weight because my demanding corporate investment banking job doesn’t give me much time to exercise except for maybe 30 min a day. So I agreed with her, and I told her I would extend my exercise time on my last day (I recently resigned due to my demanding boss + to work for my family’s business). 

Today, she kept telling me to eat more meat. So I did. She told me again. I ate more meat. And then she started forcing me to eat more meat again! I kinda lost it. I told her she lectured me nonstop yesterday on how I was supposed to lose weight and become as skinny as I was during pandemic. And now she’s telling me to eat more? I had already eaten my vegetables, a small serving of noodles, and a lot of meat. Does she want my losing weight to backfire?

Now she and my dad are on my case saying I’m twisting words. They said “We only meant you shouldn’t eat dessert anymore! Not for you to cut down on meat and carbs.” Which is crazy because they told me to cut down on everything especially carbs and meat!!! I told them evenly that I already cut out sugar a long time ago from my diet and when I occasionally get coffee or matcha, I take it with no milk nor sugar. Just plain for the caffeine.

And now they’re having a fit over me. Saying I’m cursed in this life and the next. Ha! I told them I am destined to always live a good and fortuitous life with people who love me and they are the ones who will experience a terrible life.

1kq35sf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kq35sf/my_partner_24nb_has_debilitating_anxiety_and_its/,My partner (24nb) has debilitating anxiety and it's tearing me (24f) apart.,"TLDR at bottom. 

I (24f) have been with my partner Sam (24nb) for three years. We've been struggling in our relationship recently, and I'm starting to think maybe I jumped in too fast. The first year of our relationship was everything I could've asked for; they were attentive and supportive of me, we had deep conversations, went to local events, hung out with friends, and were silly together. I believe we were both having a phenomenal time and I looked forward to seeing them at the end of every day. 

Naturally we decided to move in together during the second year of our relationship. We had both finished undergrad, and I was starting grad school. Sam however was having a hard time finding a job they liked working. They also hated our new apartment. From my point of view they have debilitating anxiety and it's become the main issue in our relationship. The apartment was too loud, and too bright, and had too many windows. They couldn't sleep. My music was too loud so I stopped playing it. They are incredibly paranoid about the neighbors hearing us make any sort of noise. They would cry all the time, and if they weren't crying they'd get completely quiet and despondent but never tell me anything was wrong.

Sam clearly struggles with anxiety and that's part of why I've chosen to stick it out through now. I still love them and care so deeply about them, and I wanted to stay by their side through their darkest moment. I think graduating really triggered the worst of their anxiety. They feel directionless, still can't find a job they like, and apparently hate city living with a burning passion. I've tried to be supportive and accommodate their needs however I can, but these have been the hardest two years of my education and I feel like I also needed support.

There's so much more to cover, but for the sake of brevity here's what happened today. From when we woke up I knew something was wrong. I asked but they wouldn't respond. We ended up having coffee together and I baked some cookies. The plan was to have coffee, go cat sit for a friend, and then run some errands. During the morning Sam couldn't decide what to do. They were going to bake with me, but ended up sulking on the couch instead. Then they tried to initiate sex while the cookies were baking, but went stiff as a board when we started to kiss. We ended up doing nothing so I said we should go feed our friends cat soon, but they wanted to shower. 

It ended up that I went to feed the cat while they showered. They were supposed to meet me downstairs by the time I got back. Instead I had to park the car, come upstairs, and ask when they'd be ready. They were not getting ready, they had crawled back into bed, still damp, and they were sobbing. They wouldn't say a word to me for about half an hour, and then they got super pissed at me. 

They said things including (from memory) :
""this isn't working"" 
""were not compatible""
""were not sexually compatible""
""I hate you""
""get away from me""
""I just want to get away from you""
""I can't get better around you""
""you look and act too childish""
""I hate your lanyard"" 
""I wish I was mature enough to be with someone older""
""I hate your clammy hands"" 
""I treat you terribly"" 
""I hate myself I'm fucking garbage"" x10
""I want to drive off a cliff"" x10

Sam was having a full blown panic attack and I honestly didn't know what to say. I didn't want to end three years just like that, and tbh I still don't know if they were serious about anything they said. They preceded to kick the shit out of a stool in the kitchen, heave sob on the floor, and flail on the couch in a temper tantrum and fling all the pillows. They calmed down a little after maybe 2-3hours of this, we ate dinner, and then they broke down again over not having lunch for tomorrow. They WAILED; like a mother who lost her child, loudly, dramatically, until bed. 

Its been so confusing for me bc as soon as their anxiety eases they're so sweet again and apologetic. I still love who they are, but it feels like they're anxious panic more often than they're Sam. The anxiety and apology cycle feels like accidental love bombing. They have a full blown meltdown at least once a day at this point, be it about physical health, work anxiety, social anxiety, boredom, the state of the world, the sound of the train..... 

I'm not sure what I should do from here on out. I still desperately want things to work out, but I think I'm kidding myself. Besides the theatrics of the meltdowns I'm starting to think we are incompatible. I need to live in a city, they want a yard. I don't want kids but do want to get married, while it's the opposite for them. I want to go out and dance and open the windows and play music, whereas that causes them anxiety. And honestly, we haven't had good sex in a year and a half. I've just started to feel numb to their anxiety and distress, which makes me feel guilty, but it's been two years of this every single day. 

So to anyone reading, is there a way you can see us being able to repair this relationship? How would you go about it? If not can you give some real world advice on how to deal with a breakup like this? I'm worried they may hurt themselves if we break up/they have no strong support system to turn to. I'm also ever so slightly terrified of breaking our lease, signing the car over, and wiping my savings.

TLDR: I think my partner of 3 years is accidentally making my life a nightmare due to their uncontrolled anxiety. I thought I would marry them, but maybe we should just break up? ",3,1747629276.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

I have known the older one (let’s call her A) since my first day of uni and have known the younger (B) for about 3 years. About 2 years ago A told me she was tired of paying 1.5x the median wage for a one bedroom apartment and so she was planing to join up with B to share an apartment, but there were no two bedroom apartments in the area, asking me if I wanted to join them so we could rent a three bedroom one. At the time I was living about 20min car from uni so I spoke with my parents and accepted. 

Before anything else we set some ground rules, I agreed to stop throwing daily dinners with friends, that we would have any girlfriends/boyfriends 24/7 around the house, and to not having any guns in the house (I’m a hunter) and they agreed to me bringing my weekly cleaning lady (she is and old lady and I didn’t want to sack her) and that we wouldn’t be bringing guys/girls around when there were others around.

I started looking for apartments and found a three bedroom one for about half what it should be going for. When I visited they explained that they hadn’t rented it yet because it had some minor problems. My dad owned a construction company so I quickly closed the deal and took care of the problems (about two afternoons between me and a guy from work). 

The problems started quickly, about a month after, we all had gone to a party the night before, I had gone home earlier because I worked the next day. I woke up, went to take my coffee when two random guys enter my kitchen looking for breakfast. They quickly understood by my face they weren’t supposed to be there and went home. When the cleaning lady arrived she asked me if she could use the vacuum and I told her to wait for the girls to wake up. She told me both their rooms had their doors open and were empty. They had both brought guys over, fucked them, left them sleeping in our home and took a ride with As father to a beach complex about 300km from there.

When I told them that leaving two randoms home alone with me was not only a breach of our rules but also a clear lack of respect for me and the safety of our home (they had met them the night before) they told me I was overreacting, that they were friends from a friend and that I didn’t want them to have a sexual life. The argument died off because they were off for about a month and when they got back I was also on vacation for a month.

Then, some months after, we were all on a festival, I was in an after and I get a call from A asking me to go home because B had brought some guys home, then went to the hospital with one because his friends had beaten him and she had left the others in our living room, and so she had locked herself in her room. I went home with a friend and told the guys to go home, which they went. We both spoke with B when she returned she told us she was sorry and that it wouldn’t happen again.

Then, some months after, the three of us went to a club with some friends, the club closed and I went home to sleep and they stayed in an after. About 30min into my slumber I wake up with A getting railed loud and clear into the wall that separates our bedrooms. I shouted for them to go fuck some place else but that didn’t work so I went for breakfast in the bakery downstairs. Next day I told her that wasn’t ok, not only because it was a breach of our rules but also because I didn’t want to ear them getting fucked. She and B told me I was being a prude, that it was my problem, not theirs and that they didn’t have the means (or wanted) to go to motels or hotels for their hookups, and so that I wanted to prohibit them to have sex. This got to be a huge fight for some days and a lot of our common friends told me I was being an asshole and was in the wrong.

A and B hadn’t really made any female friends in uni, apart from some of our friends girlfriends, but that changed about a year ago, when they started hanging around in our house 24/7 (They were there when I left for work and when I got back from work and went to bed) with C a friend of my best friend I introduced to them, and D, the then girlfriend of a friend of mine. Quickly it became a point of ridicule in our friend group (they would say the house now had 5 inhabitants). They even started sleeping there (in A and B rooms) some nights when they had to study, go to clubs and whatnot. It started to die down some months ago when B got a boyfriend and also started to work.

2 days ago I had work meeting at noon in a bar, when I got to the bar I found A and C having a drink, they told me B had gone to her hometown and invited me to have a drink. I sat with them talking about where they would go for their Masters for about 30min until the guy I had to meet arrived, then I went to a meeting room in the back and only left after about 6 hours. When I got home I found A and C in our living room with two guys. (I knew one of the guys because about two years ago he and three friends showed up coked up to my summerhouse with broken bottles wanting to beat the shit out of our friend group because my friend had fucked his ex-ex-girlfriend. They climbed the fence and I pointed a shotgun at them so they quickly left.) They looked at the in silence for about a solid minute, I asked them why they were staring, if they were expecting a hug or something, told them that it was already 6 in the morning I was going to sleep, that they should do the same and that we would speak the next day.

About an hour later I wake up the sound of the 4 of them having sex in As room. I honestly didn’t know if I should knock and tell them to fuck off or if it would be wrong, so I didn’t really do anything for 1/2mins, then I heard the guys cum, and about 10min after everyone went silent. I had worked for about 26h so I quickly went back to sleep and when I woke up everyone was gone. 

I had a business trip yesterday and today and didn’t think I should confront them on the phone so we haven’t yet addressed the problem. I’m going home tomorrow to talk with A (I don’t even know if B is aware) but I’m already expecting the same bullshit answers, that I’m a prude, that I’m overreacting, and all that shit.

I don’t fucking understand what their problem is. I have also had hookups in the last year and an half, but I do it when I know they won’t be home, in the girls homes or in hotels, so I’m not asking them to do anything I’m not doing currently.

Apart from her don’t giving a shit that I’m woken up to her being railed that there is also the problem that she found it okay to bring to our house a guy who invaded my house coked up with a broken bottle (which I’m almost certain she knows about) and the big problem that she finds it okay to hold foursomes with two guys and a girl who doesn’t even live there while I’m home.

I’m fucking fed up with them (now mostly A), and if it wasn’t for me not being able to find other housing options (an apartment in the area is now about 4/5x a median wage), I would have already left. The good news is Bs leaving in the Summer for her Masters and As might be leaving in the Winter (or maybe only next Summer) and I have since got a better job so I can afford to rent the apartment all on my own.

Both my name and As fathers is in the lease, and I’m tired of them breaking clear rules and making our house not a good place to live, so I’m think about asking A to move out when B does so. I told some of my friends and some of them told me it was too much and one of them even told me that I was being an asshole. So I ask, AITAH?

1kq340b,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinderstories/comments/1kq340b/york_not_my_cuppa_tea/,York’ Not my Cuppa Tea,"I met this bloke from York on tinder last year. At first, he seemed alright – polite, a bit shy, and genuinely interested. We agreed to meet at a Costa as I was through for a day trip, and I thought, “How bad can a date with a York lad be?”

Well, I was about to find out.

He arrived looking like he’d just lost a fight with a scarecrow. This monstrous, sun-faded gardening hat sat atop his head like a medieval helmet. It had flowers, dirt stains, and even what I swear was a dead leaf stuck on the brim. I forced a smile, thinking maybe it was some weird hipster thing.

We sat down. He ordered “Yorkshire style” coffee – black, no sugar – but when the waiter brought it, he whipped out a tiny milk jug and started pouring milk in without asking. “That’s how my mum does it,” he said with the pride of a knight revealing a secret weapon. I wanted to tell him that mixing black coffee and milk like that was basically a crime, but I held back.

Then the conversation took a turn for the surreal. He launched into a full-on epic about Yorkshire pudding – and I mean epic. Like, Shakespearean levels of passion. “The golden crust! The soft, fluffy interior! It’s the culinary crown jewel of England!” he declared, practically swooning. I tried to chip in with a word or two about food, but he waved me off like a peasant interrupting the king.

Suddenly, he jumped up and announced, “Come on! We have to go to the park. The spirits of Yorkshire demand it!”

I followed, confused but curious. At the park, he dropped to his knees, pointed at a squirrel, and whispered dramatically, “Behold! A Yorkshire dragon in disguise.” Then he whipped out a tiny homemade staff – yes, a staff – from his bag and started “casting spells” on the squirrel. People nearby gave us the kind of looks that could melt steel.

“Don’t worry,” he said, eyes wide, “I’m the guardian of the Yorkshire wilds. These dragons and I, we keep the peace.”

At that point, I was trapped in a fantasy novel written by someone who skipped all the good parts and went straight to the crazy.

To put an end to the chaos, I suggested we head back. He appeared distraught and exclaimed, “Wait! You have to see my collection of Yorkshire tea mugs. They’re sacred!”

Politely declining, I made a break for it.

As I turned away, I caught a glimpse of him. Kneeling on the pavement, he solemnly “knighted” a pigeon with his makeshift staff, chanting something about “old mate Percy.” If there had been a spotlight, I swear I would have fainted on the spot.

That night, I vowed never to go on a date with anyone who owns a gardening hat, talks to squirrels, or believes in Yorkshire dragons.

1kq30er,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_james_thrivedaily/comments/1kq30er/daily_habits_for_a_healthier_happier_you/,"Daily Habits for a Healthier, Happier You!","Maintaining your health and happiness can often feel like a juggling act. Between work, family responsibilities, and the never-ending list of to-dos, it’s easy to put your own well-being on the back burner. But the truth is, a healthier and happier life doesn’t come from drastic changes or quick fixes — it comes from simple, sustainable daily habits.

If you’re looking to feel better physically, mentally, and emotionally, start by building a solid foundation of wellness-focused routines. Here are some powerful daily habits that can help you thrive every day.

# 1. Start Your Day with Intention

How you begin your morning can set the tone for the entire day. Instead of reaching for your phone right away, take a few minutes to ground yourself. Whether it’s deep breathing, a quick meditation, or jotting down three things you’re grateful for, a mindful start helps you enter the day with purpose.

**Morning habit tip:**  
Try a 5-minute mindfulness routine: Sit quietly, close your eyes, and take deep breaths. Focus on how you want to feel today — calm, focused, energized — and visualize yourself achieving it.

# 2. Hydrate Early and Often

Your body is made up of around 60% water, so it’s no surprise that hydration plays a major role in your health. Drinking water first thing in the morning helps kickstart your metabolism, flush out toxins, and boost your energy levels.

**Daily hydration habit:**  
Start your day with a glass of warm water and lemon. Keep a reusable water bottle nearby and aim to drink at least 8 cups (2 liters) of water throughout the day.

# 3. Move Your Body Every Day

You don’t need an intense gym session to reap the benefits of exercise. Even 20–30 minutes of movement can increase your energy, improve your mood, reduce stress, and support heart health. The key is consistency.

**Fitness habit ideas:**

* Take a brisk walk during lunch breaks.
* Stretch or do yoga in the morning or evening.
* Dance to your favorite music.
* Try short home workouts using bodyweight exercises.

The best workout is the one you enjoy — so make it fun and make it yours.

# 4. Nourish Your Body with Whole Foods

Food is more than just fuel — it’s information for your body and mind. Choosing nutrient-dense, whole foods helps stabilize energy levels, improve mood, and support your immune system.

**Healthy eating habits:**

* Prioritize colorful fruits and vegetables.
* Include lean proteins and healthy fats.
* Reduce processed foods and added sugars.
* Eat mindfully — slow down and enjoy your meals.

Planning your meals ahead of time can also help you make better choices and avoid unhealthy snacking.

# 5. Take Breaks and Breathe

Mental fatigue is real. If you spend hours working at a desk or constantly switching between tasks, your brain needs a chance to reset. Taking short breaks improves focus and productivity.

**Mindfulness habit:**  
Try the **Pomodoro Technique** — work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. During your break, stretch, take a walk, or simply breathe deeply for a few moments.

# 6. Practice Gratitude and Positivity

Gratitude has been linked to greater happiness, better relationships, and improved mental health. When you take time to focus on what’s going right, you create a mental shift toward positivity.

**Gratitude habit:**  
At the end of each day, write down 3 things you’re thankful for. They can be big or small — from a good conversation to a hot cup of coffee. Over time, this habit rewires your brain to notice and appreciate life’s simple joys.

# 7. Limit Screen Time, Especially at Night

Too much screen time — especially on social media — can increase anxiety, disrupt sleep, and reduce your sense of well-being. Creating boundaries around technology use is a powerful step toward a healthier life.

**Digital wellness tip:**  
Try a digital detox for at least an hour before bed. Replace screen time with reading, journaling, or a calming bedtime routine.

# 8. Prioritize Quality Sleep

Sleep is the ultimate reset for your body and mind. Without enough rest, your immune system weakens, stress levels rise, and cognitive performance declines. Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep each night.

**Sleep-enhancing habits:**

* Stick to a consistent sleep schedule.
* Avoid caffeine and heavy meals before bed.
* Create a relaxing bedtime ritual (e.g., warm bath, aromatherapy, or soft music).
* Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.

# 9. Connect with Others

Humans are social creatures, and meaningful relationships are essential to our emotional well-being. Taking time to nurture your connections — whether through a conversation, a shared meal, or a text — can lift your mood and reduce stress.

**Social wellness habit:**  
Reach out to a friend or family member at least once a day. Even a short check-in can make a big difference in your emotional health.

# 10. Reflect and Reset Daily

Before you go to bed, take a few minutes to check in with yourself. What went well today? What challenged you? What can you do differently tomorrow?

**Evening reflection habit:**

* Keep a simple journal or use a guided template.
* Practice self-compassion: speak to yourself with the same kindness you would offer a friend.
* Set one small intention for the next day.

**Start Small, Stay Consistent**

Building a healthier, happier life doesn’t require perfection — it requires progress. Choose one or two habits from this list and begin there. As they become part of your daily rhythm, layer in more. The magic of habits lies in their ability to compound over time.

Remember, wellness is a journey, not a destination. With intention, mindfulness, and self-compassion, you can create a daily life that supports your best self — one habit at a time.",1,1747628721.0,u_james_thrivedaily,0,1.0,False

My friend was over visiting, I offered tea. She said yes.

She's not much of a tea drinker - she normally drinks cheap herbal teas (which are not Actually Tea anyway), and isn't picky. I, on the other hand, have a cabinet full of teas of various types, imported from around the world.

I offered her a decent selection: a nice oolong, a nice white tea, a high-quality herbal, a good flavored black. She pointed at something else in the cabinet and went ""what about that one?""

I hesitated, then said it's pretty expensive pu-erh I had imported, and she probably wouldn't like it anyway. She said I'm being stingy and could let her taste for herself.

But pu-erh is a polarizing tea anyway, and this stuff is not cheap at all, and it would be difficult for me to get more of this brand. I know I can make multiple cups from it, but I hadn't been planning on doing a pu-erh week right now, and really didn't want to ""waste"" it on someone who probably wouldn't like it anyway. She doesn't even like strong black tea!

(for those not in the know: my family has compared the smell of pu-erh to ""fish"" and ""dirty socks"". I like it a lot, but I understand it's not everybody's thing.)

Now she's being passive aggressive at me. AITA?

***Top Comments:***

**Clean-Patient-8809**: (Top commenter) NTA. Especially since making that particular type of tea for her would mean forcing you to use or waste your whole supply in a short period of time. Weird that she wasn't happy choosing from the ones you offered.

>**OOP:** I think she was just kinda nosing at my interesting-looking tea cabinet. Which I get, but when I visit my fellow tea-drinking friends, even if I see something shiny I'll generally keep my eyes to myself unless it's offered... tea can be very expensive.  
If it had been a different tea I might've given her anyway, but I just couldn't bring myself with the pu-erh.

*Editor's note: this commenter responded to OOP and it was one of the most awarded and top voted comments. I found it very enlightening so added it here!*

**epoops:** I wanted to respond to you here (you’re NTA by the way) that I am an AVID tea drinker of over 30 years. I love tea. I am someone who spends too much on tea. I fucking HATE most pu-erhs, most just don’t agree with me. So your friend, not even being super into tea, being pissed about you not offering the pu-erh is a her thing. Like she’s absolutely gonna waste it. In the very off chance she wouldn’t have wasted it… you weren’t in the mood that week to brew the stuff!!

When I have non tea loving friends over, and I offer them a drink including tea, I just don’t offer them my special stuff. It is what it is! Maybe they’ll appreciate it but they probably wouldn’t knowing they don’t care for tea so that’s a few cups down the drain for my consumption. When I have tea lovers over, I absolutely offer my crème de la creme.

It’s like wine or other alcohol. When I used to drink, if someone offered me wine, I couldn’t tell if it was two buck chuck or some $100 bottle because I wasn’t a wine person. Good wine was wasted on me. Whenever a friend wanted to open a good bottle while I was hanging out with them, I always told them ONLY open it if THEY want to appreciate it. Because to me, it’ll just be “wine” and I’d never want them to waste it on me if they were only opening it because of my company.

So your friend being pissed, esp when you offered other GOOD tea is being petty with the passive aggressiveness. I’d be so fucking pissed - but only for a moment - if someone wanted my $50 for 100g tea and then said “oh eh it’s just like the stuff I get at Costco.” Your friend could be annoyed - but only for a moment! The fact she’s still being pissy is not ok, at the end of the day, it’s just tea! Why stay passive aggressive over it.

I’d flat out say to her : did you want gym sock fish smelling tea? I didn’t think you’d like it since most don’t. But if so, I’ll let you have some gym sock fish tea next time since you want to try it so badly, just be aware that’s all you’ll be drinking when you’re over since I am not in a position to allow this tea to go to waste.

That should shut her up or at least will try to stop her passive aggressiveness. You tell someone up front ok sure you can try this but that’s ALL you’re having then, they usually stfu and move on

>**OOP:** I very much appreciate your comment (and oh god, feel you on the $50 for 100g, oh dear). I have also definitely had friends who ask for tea, brew a cup, and then drink three sips and the rest gets poured out. Sob.  
And the tea I offered her was good! Absolutely not trash tea.  
In my friend's defense, though, while she was a bit snitty, she didn't throw a whole tantrum or anything, and we parted cordially. I just felt bad afterwards, which was why I posted.

***Some of OOP's Comments***

Commenter: YTA. By specifically saying the tea is expensive you definitely created the impression that you didn't want to give it to her for that reason.

You could've simply said it has a strong flavor (or whatever) and that a lot of people don't care for it. You could've let her smell the tea leaves.

You also sound really judgmental, putting her down for drinking ""cheap"" tea, ""which isn't really tea anyway."" While the latter statement is technically true, it makes you sound arrogant.

She's being passive aggressive because she thinks you were rude to her.

Is she really even a friend? Or do you just enjoy putting her down?

>**OOP:** I have nothing against her drinking cheap tea. The ""isn't really tea anyway"" is about *herbal* teas, which... are literally not tea, and no tea-drinker I knows will refer to them as ""actual"" tea. I didn't say that to her, anyway. Please note the Humorous Capitalization used there.  
My point is that it's a very different flavor for someone who generally drinks herbals.  
Smelling would have been no use. It doesn't have a strong smell, and nothing prepares you for the pitch black that results.  
Taking this all the way to ""is she really a friend"" over a minor conflict about tea is a bit much, imo.

Commenter: \[...\] ""Taking this all the way to ""is she really a friend"" over a minor conflict about tea is a bit much, imo."" I guess you haven't been on reddit very long! Also, it doesn't sound that minor if she's being passive-aggressive with you. That means she's unhappy.

>**OOP:** She was passive aggressive for a bit, then we kept hanging out and parted cordially. I just felt bad afterwards and decided to post, since I figured AITA could use a change from crazy fiancees, inheritance entitlement, and childfree weddings.

Commenter: NTA. Your mate was out of line. You offered her decent tea, she went poking about and asked for your good stuff like it was hers. That pu-erh’s not builder's brew – it’s niche, expensive, and an acquired taste. If she’s not even into proper tea and normally drinks glorified potpourri, what’s she on about?

If she normally drinks floral bathwater, she’d likely hate the pu-erh anyway. Let her sulk, she’s being daft.

>**OOP:** Thank you for at least understanding my strong feelings about herbal vs. tea, lol.  
fwiw this isn't a huge strop, she was just annoyed. It's not the highest-stakes conflict I've ever been involved in, I just felt a bit bad afterwards.

Commenter: I think one could phrase it better than ""I don't want to waste it on you."" I would walk out if an alleged ""friend"" said that to me.

>**OOP:** fwiw, I didn't say that. I said very apologetically that it's really difficult to get, admittedly mentioning that it's expensive was a mistake, and that pu-erh is a very polarizing tea and lots of people don't like it (and included the anecdote about my family and the fish comments).  
I clearly wasn't the most tactful, hence coming here, but I wasn't actually trying to be a massive jerk about it.

Commenter: INFO....why open the cabinet and give choices? You're the host, you choose what to serve. It avoids awkward conversations.

>**OOP:** The tea was in the cabinet. I opened it and took out several options to offer her (including an herbal). She looked in the cabinet while I was doing so and asked about the pu-erh.  
I hadn't thought to pre-remove the tea from the cabinet so she wouldn't see that there's other tea, because most people will choose from provided options.

Commenter: Seems like being a snob got you in trouble.  When she asked what it was, you could have just taken it down, told her about it, how you find the taste of it and let her smell it. Probably she would have nodded politely and moved on, satisfied. 

She was curious and you defaulted to ""You couldn't possibly appreciate this fine brew."" And that's why she got mad at you. 

YTA for being a snob about tea and judging other people's palates.

>**OOP:** It's kind of the opposite of ""appreciate this fine brew"", though? Yes it's expensive, but I have yet to meet anybody around me who actually likes pu-erh, because it's so smelly. Even my lapsang souchong drinking husband doesn't like it.  
It's not a snobbery thing, it's really that many people\* just don't like it, even among tea snobs.  
I know it wasn't smart to mention the price, which redirected the whole issue.  
\*eta: many people *I know* don't like it. I am aware that it has plenty of afficionados

Commenter: Then say that. Saying what you said comes off as snobby. Literally just telling them it can smell like fish or old socks would turn most people away.

>**OOP:** Can't believe I fell into the perpetual trap of not being specific enough in the OP :(

Commenter: Lmao you totally said all of that didnt you

>**OOP:** I absolutely told the old socks story :(((( it's a very funny story.  
The funnier part was that when I got my first pu-erh and was young and foolish, I was steeping that shit for like 4 minutes. yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh the family had lots of comments about it

Commenter: NTA. I can't imagine pointing beyond the offerings given to me. If none of those are tempting, just have a glass of water. Probably should have left out the cost but refusing to make it for her is reasonable since it's obviously more high-maintenance *and* not to her taste.

>**OOP:** Mentioning the cost was definitely a stupid moment for me. Though in fairness, I have another friend who's a big tea-drinker and if she said some tea was super rare/super expensive, I'd be like yeah no, enjoy that! I can fund my own expensive hobby lol  
Still, not my finest hour

*The tea itself:*

>This pu-erh is wayyyy above my normal price range, because while I may have a bit of a tea problem, my wallet is not fat enough to really indulge. I'd received it as a gift from someone who had it gifted to them and was like ""I don't like tea anyway, d'you want it"". It was like gold from heaven.

Commenter: \[...\] But you act rather snobby about her preferring herbal infusions and definitely came across as rude and demeaning with ""she probably wouldnt even like it anyways""-

>**OOP:** I didn't tell *her* she drinks cheap herbals. I told you guys - because she does. She buys the cheapest supermarket stuff. I even buy the more expensive herbals, the ones with big fat sachets full of whole leaves and flowers and such.  
It was just to explain her general taste in tea/herbal. I'm fine with her enjoying what she enjoys.

Commenter: “I don’t talk down about my friends to their faces, just anonymously online” isn’t much better. For the record, I think you’re NTA in this story, but could’ve handled it WAY better, as others have mentioned. But in general yeah you come across as an asshole about this. You seem like the type of snobby tea drinker that makes people dislike tea drinkers and tea

>**OOP:** I don't think it's talking down to her. She will also say she buys the inexpensive tea, because it tastes fine to her. It's a description of her actual herbal-tea-shopping habits. I have some things where I'll buy the cheap option, because I don't care or can't tell the difference myself (like coffee. I tell my friends not to waste their good coffee on me, since I don't particularly like it anyway and will just dump sugar in it).  
It's a factual description of the type of herbal tea she buys. She's a lovely person, which has no bearing on her choice of hot beverages.

Commenter: The number of people mad at you for *accurately* (and in a tongue in cheek way) pointing out herbal teas are not tea is hilarious.

It’s like pointing out a turkey sandwich isn’t a burger and having the turkey sandwich lovers come out in anger.

>**OOP:** I honestly thought the whole post was phrased fairly lightly, to reflect this exceedingly minor conflict!  
and idk, I find tea and coffee snobbism pretty entertaining and low stakes (except for the wallets of everyone involved)

Commenter: Your post was phrased totally fine. The problem is with the weirdos who find it offensive to point out that “herbal tea” is not tea.

>**OOP:** I also feel like in this case at least, it is relevant information? Tea tends to have a more bitter edge, tannins, and a very specific flavor that herbals *won't* have. So somebody who generally drinks herbal tea is already not quite approaching with the same flavor expectations as a tea-tea drinker.  
Anyway, I like chamomile, for example, but it's a different flavor than tea-from-the-tea-plant. It's just a different thing.

***Editor's note:*** *There are many comments dissecting OOP's tone and her emotional state and OOP trying to explain that this is meant to be a light hearted post and that their friendship is totally fine. I did not feel like including any more of those comments.*

***OOP is voted NTA, but comments are heavily mixed***

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kkzj6b/update_aita_for_not_sharing_the_good_tea_with_a/)**: May 12, 2025 (19 days later)**

So I was judged NTA on the post, but there was definitely a lot of very... lively discussion about tea, tea snobs, and inappropriate nosing in cabinets. I very much appreciated all the comments.

As it happened, about a week after the post, our friend-group whatsapp started talking about...you guessed it...tea. Specifically, somebody went ""what do you mean 'different types of tea', like verbena?"", and *another* friend, not even me, went off about how that's not *real* tea (look, my friends and I agree on the important things in life) (also I'm waiting for people to wonder why tf we keep on talking about tea on our whatsapp group. it doesn't actually happen that often, I swear).

Anyway I jumped in and said HOW ABOUT WE HAVE A TEA PARTY and I will let y'all try the fancy stuff.

So we did! About ten friends came, including the original friend who was cruelly denied the Good Pu-erh.

We tried 8 different types of tea, including some variants of the same type, so they could compare the flavors (e.g. two oolongs, two English Breakfasts). The biggest hit was the chai, lol. Afterwards some people asked where they could order some of the teas for themselves.

And as for the friend from the first post, she tried the coveted pu-erh aaaaaaaand.... did not like it lol. Otoh, her heart opened to the genmaicha. One of my other friends did enjoy the pu-erh, though.

Everyone had a good time, and agreed that we should totally do it again. I am now sitting here and sipping my third steep of the leaves with great satisfaction.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Good for you!! I think it's great that you could work it out in a positive way. And everyone now gets to enjoy tea parties 🎉

>**OOP:** It was a really positive ending to the whole thing! It was also really fun hearing my friends comparing the tea flavors to each other and commenting on them.  
People also brought finger foods and cookies and stuff, to make it a proper party :)

Commenter: I love the way the flavor profile \[of Pu-erh\] changes over multiple steeps

>**OOP:** definitely. And I just kind of love that it *has* multiple steeps, because that way my tea leaves sit there looking at me and I go ""ah well, I guess I just *have* to have another cup!""",223,1747628429.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,81,0.94,False
