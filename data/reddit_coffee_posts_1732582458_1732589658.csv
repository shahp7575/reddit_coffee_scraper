1h01k9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h01k9c/lowering_opv_on_v1_silvia_with_nonadjustable_opv/,Lowering OPV on V1 Silvia with Non-Adjustable OPV Valve Using Extra Custom Washers,"I saw this basic technique on another post, but haven't been able to find it to credit the author. If anyone finds it, I'd be happy to remedy that.

I recently acquired a V1 Silvia in excellent shape. The non-adjustable OPV was set to around 10.5 bar, and I want to do single dosing with a non-pressurized basket, so I needed to lower it. I had already replaced the spring and gasket in the valve with new ones from Stefanos. 

I found a post where someone had simply added extra copper washers to reduce the tension on the spring and lower the pressure. The ones I got were M17 \* 21mm \* 1.0 mm. However, adding a single extra 1 mm thick washer dropped the pressure down to 6-7 bars! It's shocking that such a small change could make such a big difference, and I've had several arguments with my partner about how that seems to violate Hooke's Law of Spring Tension!

The original washer was 0.9-1mm.  I ended up having to hammer the washers flatter, and the final thickness that got me from 10.5 to 9 bars was 1.1mm, only 0.1-0.2 mm difference! I'm kind of shocked my skill-free tippy-tapping got the job done, but it worked, and was super cheap. I had to beat down two washers that together were the 1.1 mm thick when I was done. Also keep in mind that the reason copper washers are used here is because they crush a little when you crank down the brass, so it's better to bias on the side of too thick, since you can't unflatten the washers if you make them too thin. It did require a \*lot\* of trial and error.

This house is 3 stories high and the third floor bairly has any walls.

Now my bestie lets call her Helen recently broke up with her girlfriend of 3 years. Now her ex decided to burn all the stuff she left at her place and Helen decided to do the same. So neither of us has a fire place or a prope r place to start a fire soo we decided to do it in the abandoned house.We took the hoodie she left up to the third floor and started burning it. I should note that we had water to stop the fire, the fire was so small you can pretty much blow it out and we didn't just leave it.

Now while watching the fire we heard a shout coming from the houses right a cross.. it was an old man in his 60's yelling ""extinguish the fire"". We immediately did and ran out of the abandond house.

Now as we were going home we passed the mans house (it was a... not in shape man) and he started screaming ""ARE YOU CRAZY WHY DID YOU START THE FIRE"" and honestly we acted dumb then the man yelled ""IM GONNA BEAT YOUR PU\*\*Y""(it is a literal translation from my native language it means he is gonna beat us) .

My friend and I laughed id disbelief and he got even more mad and said ""WANT ME TO COME DOWN THERE"" Helen chuckled and said ""sure, come down"" as he stumbled out of his chair and out of the door of the balcony he was on me and Helen started RUNNING.

1h014gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverDisease/comments/1h014gb/liver_biopsy_and_clarity/,Liver biopsy and clarity. ,"Hey;) so I have posted here a few times before trying to figure out what is going on with my liver. Just to give some information. I‚Äôm a 41yr old female. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù2 and 160 pounds. I have been on suboxine for 12 years and take 8mg daily. I just started taking anxiety and adhd meds because my health anxiety was so out of control I had to do something. I take 20mg Trantillix and 15mg of Adderall. I was working out daily until I got to mentally overwhelmed by everything going on with my health. I also have substituted coffee with 1 5hr extra strength energy for 15 years. I take 1 in the morning. However because it has all of the vitamins B/ Niacin and supplements I have recently stopped. 

In 2017 my ALT was 47. However, nothing was ever done about it and I just found out about the elevation in 2023 through the my chart app. No Dr ever discussed it with me. 

2022 I went to my yearly Dr appt amd he ordered labs. My ALT and AST came up mildly elevated. I thought it was the Benadryl I was taking at night so I immediately stopped, got a sonogram of my liver. Redid the bloodwork in 2 weeks the enzymes subsided and sonogram came back good. 

2023 I went back in for my yearly visit and to no surprise my enzymes where elevated but this time it was my AST,ALT and ALP all were mildly elevated. However, I was taking zzzquill ( didn‚Äôt realize it had Benadryl in it) thinking this was the issue. I stopped taking zzzquil and got another sonogram. This sonogram came back as I had hyper portal tension. I was referred to a gastro/liver doct and given orders to get a MRI 

January 2024 was my 1st visit with the liver doc he read my amd said it MRI looked good. I guess the sonogram was read incorrectly. He ordered blood work I went and got it done and Ina month or so I went back to see him. My levels had dropped he thought maybe this was a liver injury from the Benadryl. However, he ordered follow up blood work for 6 months to check my enzymes again. He told me to go live my life, no restrictions and to just lose weight and if I could get on Ozempic do so to make the process easier for me. 

October 2024 I went back to see him. I was now on the psych medication, including hydroxyzine. I realize it‚Äôs an antihistamine, but my psychiatrist did not think it would affect me because Benadryl is a bit more harsh on the body. However, when I got my labs back, the liver doctor told me that my ALP,AST and ALT were again high. I asked could
It be the antihistamines. he did say if I‚Äôm reacting to antihistamines I have to stay away completely from the class of medication, but he did order ANA and checked my smooth body antibiotics and a few other things. 

I waited weeks to get the results back and finally, his receptionist called me and told me that everything came back negative however, all of my enzymes at this time we‚Äôre elevated including my bile acids, bilirubin, ALT, AST, ALP. However, I was sick with a terrible cold b4 getting this bloodwork done. But I did wait 10days after I got well and 5days after taking prednisone.

Today another receptionist finally called me and told me that the doctor finally reviewed my labs and wants to do a liver biopsy. I tried to ask questions however she did not know any of the answers so now I‚Äôm just waiting for the hospital to call. 

I am scared. But I really just need some clarity. I try and ask questions and I‚Äôm given no answers. I have asked him 2 times does he think this could be the Big  C and he told me no. But I don‚Äôt have any faith for the drs in this area or labs. Just trying to explain all the mistakes that have occurred would take forever. I‚Äôm just tired of being in the dark. I know nobody here can diagnose me and I‚Äôm not looking for that. But just any clarity on what all this could mean would be so helpful just so I‚Äôm somewhat prepared. I also have no clue what to expect with the liver biopsy other than it‚Äôs ct guided.‚Äô I‚Äôve not had any symptoms other than when my bile acids were Lee aged I had milk itchiness specifically my feet. Sometimes I feel a light pain on my right side but a lot of times it just feels like gas. I honestly don‚Äôt know if I would even notice the light ache if I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. 

Please also note as soon as I was told my enzymes elevated I stopped taking all antihistamines.

I am 39F and my partner 37M. We have been together for 8 and a half years. We live together since 8 years. We both work full time, we usually have coffee together in the morning (while he's mostly on his phone), then we back from work eat dinner together, after which we either watch some Netflix or he goes gaming with his buddies on discord. On weekends sometimes we go for hikes, or just chill at home which also involves reading, tv, calls to family (see below) etc. 

We are both from abroad so our families (parents) live in another continent. 

My problem is that we hardly ever do anything ""fun"" other than day hikes now and then. Ever since we live together we never went not even once to a date night, eating out, dancing... anything like that. He does go out but with his friends who he keeps separate from me and I am never invited. His excuse is that I don't speak their language (German) so I won't fit in in the hangouts. 

All the vacation time he accurs, he spends on trips to visit his family or to go visit his friends that live in different cities. For the 7 Christmas breaks since we are together, 4 I spent at home alone because he had other plans with friends and family that didn't include me. 
Many weekends he is on Skype for more than half of the day with his family rendering it impossible to do something else. I mean I also talk to my mom on Skype but I don't time these calls during ""prime time"". 

I am very unhappy about that, and he swears that he does not understand why. He says: We live together, I see you every day, why you want me to also spend my vacation time with you - I spend with you the most time compared with other people. 

It's not like I don't value the time we spend together, but overall I feel lonely and isolated, and I have no one else to travel with (my friends are all married with kids and they go on family vacations where I'm obviously not invited). I don't know of any other couple who don't also spend most of their holiday together. 

For me going out and vacations are ""quality"" time that is different from everyday time. I want some ""quality"" time too. I don't want all of his time, just part.

He tells me that I am suffocating him and I expect too much, that it is not reasonable to expect him to include me in other activities because we live together. It's not reasonable to expect to go on dates and restaurants because we already live together and can eat at home. He goes on saying things like: ""oh so you are complaining I'm not treating you like a princess is that what you want"". I'm not sure that occassioanl night out and a yearly beach vacation is a princess-level treatment, I feel like it's a normal thing to share with your partner. 

I don't know how to explain him why this behavior hurts me. It seems like I am failing to explain because he doesn't get it. I really don't know what words to use. 

This is not normal is it?! I didn't have a father so I don't have a direct experience but from my own friends and the movies... Doesn't seem like what he does is is ""normal"".

He is not a bad man, he doesn't drink, doesn't have like gambling and other big addictions (gaming maybe), he's financially responsible and does fair share of chores, our sex life is good, but I am on the brink of leaving this relationship because I just feel like I'm a household object and it's not a good feeling.

# Lesson 01

# #1

# What is a Ribbit?

A Ribbit is the smallest unit of a Pepecoin

0.00000001 Pepecoin = 1 Ribbit

# #2

# What does a Pepecoin address look like?

Pepecoin addresses start with P. Here are a few examples of Pepecoin addresses.

PoAGLLWhs3B6C6nJL26wEG79DuK6jHYP28

Phm5pRuHTtJC7sULj2p6J48Bs8jY5xARHF

PtSorBvbsuL7TNshbMQ1bc2PnRneLgezsg

Please DO NOT send Pepecoin to these addresses.

# #3

# What is the currency symbol for Pepecoin?

The ‚±£ character (aka ""P with Stroke"") is the official currency symbol for Pepecoin.

# #4

# Who created Pepecoin?

Pepecoin was created by two developers, Dogecoin Shibes, and brothers, Zordiak and Karzo.

Since launch, many members of the community have stepped up to join the team and help make the vision for Pepecoin a reality.

Pepecoin is truly a community cryptocurrency. We would not be where we are without the community.

# #5

# Coins vs Tokens

There are two basic types of cryptocurrencies, coins and tokens. Tokens exist as smart contracts on a parent network like Ethereum or Solana. Coins, on the other hand, have their own blockchain. Some blockchains use Proof-of-Work (e.g. Bitcoin) while others use Proof-of-Stake (e.g. Ethereum). Ethereum is a coin, Tether is a token (created via a smart contract) on Ethereum.

Pepecoin is a coin with its own blockchain. It uses Proof-of-Work just like Bitcoin. You can think of Pepecoin as ""Bitcoin with a frog logo"".

# #6

# Why was Pepecoin created?

There are many Pepe cryptocurrencies. Nearly all of them are tokens. While some of these tokens have seen massive success, to make a truly great cryptocurrency, having your own blockchain is a must. Quite simply, Pepecoin was created because we have a much bigger vision for a Pepe cryptocurrency. A vision that can only be achieved by having Pepe be on his own blockchain.

We believe cryptocurrencies should be more than a price on a chart. Pepecoin transaction fees are extremely low, often fractions of a penny. This makes it the best choice for sending money to friends and family, donating to your favorite charity, or buying a cup of coffee.

Twitch streamers, YouTubers, influencers, and anyone with a social media following can accept Pepecoin donations from anyone all over the world by simply sharing their address with their followers.

We think that's pretty cool.

Respawn please just please revert Crypto to before you gave him his off the grid perk. There is no reason for him to be Nerfed like he was some sort of unstoppable meta breaking giant like Horizon or Pathfinder or any of your newly glazed Support legends. There was no need to make his emp useless by hand crafting a season where the only reward he gets from a successful emp is having support legends take a 5 second coffee break to undo it, there was no need to nerf his base kit because of a perk you made strong and then sufficiently nerfed to where only a completely blind person wouldnt notice him, and there was no reason to take away all of his counters and powercreep his niche team recovery ability and beacon scanning capabilities again due to the same perk you already nerfed. I find  it very distasteful you guys went back on your own word when you said you would use perks as a way to balance  legends as opposed to nerfing their base kit and then you went and nerfed a legend's base kit over a perk after nerfing the perk instead of just removing the perk and leaving the base kit alone.

 Where was this attitude for Horizon who can still mary poppins away and get off a shield bat at any given moment and get absolutely no audio while doing so?. Or pathfinder who has the option to scan 3 different things gets massive rotates, and has been one of if not the best legend for a while now, or any other annoiying to fight legend that has little to no ACTUAL RISK in their kits and more rewards than what you give us in any event.

 And no i do not want his kit reworked you didnt rework gibby to make his shield immune to emp, or newcastle to give him an invincible shield every 30 seconds, or rampart an obnoxious mini gun anytime she wants. I just want him to go back to being  as useful as he was before you felt the need to give him a perk you were just gonna nerf him for the minute a pro shed a tear about it. I was ok with a larger emp/scan range and the ability to move faster when i emp'd a team or baited them into destroying my drone, and the ability to say no to an enemy's shield or bubble since the cool down on my emp is significantly larger than the same shields you felt the need to remove the counters from on top of then being completely invincible by default which my drone is not. 

For all the fellow Crypto mains I see still playing him I applaud you for fighting the good fight and for respawn please just show him some love, the same way you showed some to the supports and actually think about how even a slight change(or multiple) ruins a legend especially those that already weren't even that strong to begin with.",6,1732587388.0,apexlegends,4,0.88,False

At 10:45am internal was 209¬∞ and I pulled it. So 9 hour smoke. Put it in a small cooler for 2 hours to rest.

I'm not new to eating brisket lol but I'm new to cooking it/seeing it uncooked. I think the cut I had is a flat, not a full packer? Correct me if I'm wrong. It was only labeled as ""brisket"" because it's from a half cow we purchased that was butchered at a local place, versus an official label from a grocery store. It was either 5 or 7 lbs before cooking, I forget.

Neither side of the brisket had more visible fat than the other before cooking, so I just plopped it on the grill not knowing which side should be up vs down. The end result was the top section was pretty dry and the bottom section, under that middle membrane thingy, was super moist (and had more visible fat). Maybe I should have flipped it halfway through?

Despite the top half being a little dry I have no complaints. Flavor was fantastic. The rub was great - I highly recommend it.

Made lots of brisket mac n' cheese with leftovers!

I have a second brisket from the same cow in the freezer. I'm curious if after reading this anyone has suggestions on what I should do differently next time.

The grind was quite good most of the time, consistent usually with some occasional slippage after changing the grind settings. This is the second one that has broken on me. It seems no matter how well I take care of it, grind size gradually changes and slips over and over again, more and more frequently with time. It has gotten to the point where it is nearly impossible to get a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù cup of coffee with it.

I need a new grinder, I get it. But here‚Äôs where I am uncertain. I like the idea of electric‚Ä¶it is faster, maybe more powerful, and it is certainly more convenient, yes. Then, on the other hand, I love the simplicity of a hand grinder as well as the extra effort it takes to produce a cup of coffee, it makes me appreciate it, as simple as it is. I have a few ideas in mind.

If I were to go electric, the Varia VS3 seems fitting for me, simple enough as well as being a well received grinder. I also have had some interest in the Baratza encore. It seems affordable, effective and well made, but perhaps too much plastic to justify the price? I‚Äôd like some opinions on it from those who have had/have one.

As for manual hand grinders, quite a few interest me. 1zpresso seems popular here, likely for good reason. The Knock Aergrind seems very interesting, but I am concerned about the grind for pour overs, perhaps the new version with upgraded burrs has solved some issues? Of course as well, Commandante seems like a good pick as well.

I'm a dual citizen, Canadian-UK, and have been toying with the idea of moving back to the UK (family moved to Canada when I was a child). 

I work in the heritage sector, doing historical research on culturally significant buildings and sites. Both professionally and personally, the idea of being able to work with much larger historical time scales is very appealing to me. In my current role we're mostly stopped at the early 19th century, and I would love to be able to dig into deeper timelines and narratives. 

I'm looking at a job posting for a role in London that pays approx. ¬£36,000. Without going into too much detail, it is based at a very significant historical site which is very relevant to the research being undertaken, so remote work is not an option. What are your opinions on this salary, as Londoners? I currently live alone in Toronto, so I am used to most of my income going towards rent/food with little left over, and this advertised salary is slightly higher than my current one when converted into CAD. However, I do see that it's lower than the average London salary (https://www.thetimes.com/money-mentor/income-budgeting/average-salary-london-uk). I don't drink anymore, and most of my hobbies are free/at home/low cost (yoga at home, running) with the more expensive ones being going out to see films, coffees, and vintage/thrift shopping (I'm a trope, I know). I'm single, no dependents, early 30s, and would really prefer to not have roommates. What are your thoughts? Is this salary workable to maintain a somewhat similar quality of life, or am I delusional? Any and all comments, criticisms, insights, and snarky remarks welcome.

1h00r71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1h00r71/ghosts_in_the_ghetto/,Ghosts in the Ghetto,"As a young mom I couldn't afford much. There were these low rental units just off of 22nd st. The owner of this building was basically a slumlord. I got to give him some credit though. He did attempt to renovate, and he evicted all the problematic tenants that used to live there.

The building manager was being more picky about who they let in the building now, too. So that was why the apartment building was half empty when I moved in there with my 3 yr old.
We got to know the neighbors quick. I met a woman named Rebecca. She told me that her previous boyfriend died from heart complications not too long ago. Then she told me how his friend Jim was there for her, and how they leaned on each other during their time of mourning. 
She said she moved out of her place to live with Jim in his basement suite. She wasn't much older than I was. Pretty with dark curly hair. Pale skin. 
I nodded my head and commiserated with her. It was good that they had each other. Grief was hard enough on your own. If you can find a shoulder to lean on, then it was that much lighter. 
They offered me a beer, but I declined.
And that was Rebecca. 

I was curled up on my couch watching t.v alone one night. It was after midnight. 
Someone knocked on my door. My immediate thought was who the hell would be knocking on my door at this hour?!
My nosy self headed over to the door to look into my peephole.
Standing there in the hallway under the flourescent lighting was this older gentleman. He was wearing a short sleeved colorful print shirt, khaki shorts and brown sandals. He was a white guy, with silver messy medium length hair. He had a bit of a paunch.

I opened the door. He looked at me with these sad blue eyes. He asked, ""Is Rebecca home?""
I furrowed my brow and then told him that she didn't live in this unit anymore. I told him that she moved into unit 3 downstairs.
The expression on his face after I said that. 
It was a mix of surprise, disappointment and something else. He quickly looked at his feet.
I went to close the door but he looked up at me then he said that he was thirsty. He asked me if I could please give him a glass off water?
I was a bit taken aback because what a strange request. Ever the helpful person, I said, ""Sure but stay there.""
I shut the door, locked it and then headed to the kitchen. I ran the cold tap water into a mug, then I unlocked the door.
I opened it, and as I was handing him the water I got this strong gut feeling to not touch his skin. I carefully avoided his fingers. He took a few sips and then he handed the mug back. I don't know why but I suddenly felt alarmed. Danger. I didn't let his hand touch mine. Then I closed the door quickly. My heart sped up a bit. 
The hallway was chilly, and my fingertips felt cold. I peeked into the peephole and there was no one there. 

I was uncomfortable the rest of the night, like why did I tell him where Rebecca lived? I shouldn't have done that. I felt like I did something really wrong. 
It was if I just gave a permission of some kind. Or I just allowed something to happen.

Honestly, I don't remember if these things happened before or after that night, but the lights would burn out. Especially the dining room light. It was frequent enough that I asked management to check the electrical. 
They said everything was good, there was nothing broken or loose in the wiring.

I ended up just leaving the dining room dark. 

My bf was over one evening. The three of us were watching TV together in the livingroom. My bf got up to make himself a sandwich. There was a old wooden room divider between the two rooms. We could see him at the counter fixing his snack. We had our own on the coffee table. 
My bf had to walk around the divider through the dark diningroom area to get into the kitchen.
My 3 yr old said, ""Mommy, why is that man staring at us?"" 
I asked, ""What man? Where is he?"" 
My 3 yr old pointed to the dark diningroom area.
I looked but of course no one was there. I was really creeped out but I asked, "" What does he look like?""
""He has big fat eyes, and his hair is like this."" Then my child showed me with their little hands how the mans hair stuck out, then made wavy fingers. 
Ughh!
I didn't want to scare my baby, so I pretended that what they said didn't scare me. My bf on the other hand, he was still in the kitchen and he paused mid slice after he heard that.
Then my 3 yr old said, ""He is your friend who shuts off the lights."" 
I shuddered.  
I wrapped my child up in the blankets, and my bf came over to join us. 
I stayed up that whole night just watching over them.

How can I disclose this in the smoothest way possible to him? Like, I'd really love to hangout, go out for coffee or drinks and maybe have sex sometimes hahah but that's all I can offer.

1h00pzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h00pzo/the_piper_part_22/,The Piper Part 2/2,"The continuation of part one: [The Piper Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/yJw6Ls6DQm)

Moloch, the ancient god of child sacrifice. His name had been etched into history as a symbol of humanity‚Äôs most twisted impulses. The Piper had been there in Hamlin, trying to turn the townsfolk away from Moloch. He had failed. And now I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that his struggle against that darkness wasn‚Äôt over.

The breakthrough came late one night as I scrolled through forums and subreddits I would never admit to visiting. Hidden among threads about conspiracy theories and obscure occult practices was a post that made my heart stop. It was a blurry photo of a flyer, one that looked hastily made and poorly printed.

The text read: ‚ÄúThe Flame of Moloch Burns Eternal. Join Us and See the Truth.‚Äù

It listed a date, a time, and a location‚Äîa run-down warehouse in a forgotten corner of the city.

I knew it was a risk, but I couldn‚Äôt ignore it. If this cult truly worshiped Moloch, then there was a chance‚Äîhowever slim‚Äîthat the Piper might appear. He had always opposed Moloch, always intervened when the god‚Äôs influence grew too strong. If I could witness that confrontation, maybe I could finally understand him.

I spent the next few days preparing, though I wasn‚Äôt sure for what. I bought an old coat and scuffed up some boots to look inconspicuous. I even created a fake backstory in case anyone asked questions. But as the day approached, my confidence wavered. What was I really getting myself into?

The warehouse was exactly what I expected: cold, decrepit, and reeking of mildew. A dozen or so people were gathered inside, their faces obscured by hoods or masks. At the front of the room was a makeshift altar, adorned with crude carvings of fire and horns. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made my stomach churn.

No one spoke to me as I slipped inside and found a spot near the back. A man stepped forward, his voice booming as he welcomed us to ‚Äúthe gathering.‚Äù He spoke in vague, dramatic terms about ‚Äúawakening the ancient flame‚Äù and ‚Äúshedding the chains of morality.‚Äù It was theatrical, almost laughable‚Äîuntil he began talking about a sacrifice.

I froze. The words hit me like a punch to the gut. This wasn‚Äôt just empty rhetoric. They were planning something real, something horrifying.

I waited, my pulse racing, hoping‚Äîpraying‚Äîthat the Piper would appear. This had to be the kind of moment that would draw him out, right? But as the ceremony continued, there was no sign of him. No pipes, no cloaked figure, nothing.

And then it hit me: the Piper wasn‚Äôt coming. He didn‚Äôt respond to calls‚Äîhe responded to choices.

The realization left me cold. I was in over my head, standing among people who were willing to commit unspeakable acts. And I had no idea what to do.

The Piper wouldn‚Äôt save me. If I wanted to stop this, I would have to act on my own.

But I didn't stop them.

I told myself I was outnumbered, that intervening would only draw attention to myself and put me in danger. But deep down, I knew the truth: I was paralyzed. I stood there, silent and still, as the ritual began.

The leader stepped forward, raising his arms theatrically as the gathered crowd formed a circle around the altar. The crude statue of Moloch loomed over them all, its figure carved from jagged stone. It had the body of a man but the head of a bull, its mouth wide as if mid-roar. The details were grotesque: deep grooves for muscles, cracked horns that curved upward, and eyes-blank, hollow recesses that seemed far too alive for lifeless stone.

The air in the warehouse grew heavy, oppressive. The leader began chanting in a language I didn't recognize, his voice rising and falling in a strange, unsettling rhythm.
The others joined in, their tones discordant but oddly hypnotic. It felt wrong, like the sound itself was cutting into the fabric of the world.

A few moments later, two members dragged a squealing pig into the center of the circle.
The poor animal thrashed against its restraints, its terror palpable. I held my breath, praying to whatever force might listen that the ""sacrifice"" would end there‚Äî that this ritual wouldn't spiral into something even darker.

The leader raised a long, curved blade high above his head, the metal glinting in the dim light. He shouted something
incomprehensible, and with a swift, brutal motion, brought the blade down.

The pig's cries cut off instantly, replaced by the sickening thud of its body hitting the altar. Blood spilled across the stone, pooling around the base of the statue. The chanting stopped, leaving an eerie silence in its wake.

For a moment, nothing happened. The leader lowered his blade, breathing heavily as he scanned the room. The others looked on in anticipation, their eyes fixed on the altar as if expecting something to emerge from the shadows.

And then I saw it.

The statue's eyes-those hollow, lifeless sockets-seemed to ignite. It wasn't fire, not exactly, but a dim, burning light that flickered deep within the stone. It was faint, almost imperceptible, but I felt it more than I saw it. It locked onto me, piercing through my body, my mind, my soul.
I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe. It was as if the statue was looking into me, peeling away every layer, exposing every fear and every failure. 

The cold dread that washed over me was unlike anything l'd ever felt before. It was the kind of fear that seeps into your bones and stays there, whispering that you're nothing, that you're powerless.

The leader must have noticed the change in the statue because he dropped to his knees, arms outstretched, his voice trembling with ecstatic fervor. ""Moloch has heard us!"" he shouted. ""The flame burns eternal!""

The others followed suit, dropping to their knees in unison. But I couldn't. I was frozen, locked in place by those burning, unblinking eyes.

Nothing else happened. The light in the statue's eyes faded after a few moments, leaving it as inert as it had been before. The leader, clearly disappointed but masking it with grandiose proclamations, declared the ritual a success. 

The crowd murmured their agreement, though I could hear the uncertainty in their voices.
As they dispersed, I stayed behind, unable to shake the feeling that the statue was still watching me, even as its eyes returned to lifeless stone.

That night, I couldn't sleep. The image of the statue haunted me, its hollow gaze burned into my memory. And the cold dread-the sense that something far beyond my understanding had been present in that warehouse-clung to me like a shadow.

Nothing had happened. No supernatural event, no divine retribution, no Piper. But the fear gnawed at me all the same. The Piper might not have shown himself, but I felt certain of one thing: whatever had been summoned-or almost summoned-was real.

And it was watching.

That night in my apartment was the longest night of my life.

It began with the silence‚Äîthe kind that isn‚Äôt really silence, but the absence of anything familiar. No hum of the refrigerator, no distant chatter from the neighbors. Even the city outside my window seemed to hold its breath. The world felt still, wrong, like the space between heartbeats.

I told myself I was imagining things, that my nerves were shot after the ritual, that the oppressive air in the warehouse had gotten to me. But no matter how many times I turned the TV on, turned it off, paced the room, or stared at my phone, the silence crept back in, stretching thinner and thinner, like something waiting to snap.

The shadows were different too. I noticed it first in the corners of the room, where the light from my lamps should‚Äôve cut through the dark. Instead, it seemed to pool there, deep and impenetrable, as if it wasn‚Äôt just the absence of light but the presence of something else. My apartment, my sanctuary, felt foreign.

Every sound was magnified. The creak of the old radiator rattled through the room like a gunshot. A loose floorboard groaned under my step, and I froze, heart hammering, as if something might groan back. Even my own breathing felt too loud, echoing in my chest like a drumbeat.

I couldn‚Äôt sit still. I tried to work, flipping through my notes and transcripts, but the words swam on the page. I tried to distract myself with a movie, but every flicker of movement in my peripheral vision sent my pulse racing. Was that shadow always there? Did I just see something shift?

I checked the locks three times‚Äîon the front door, the windows, even the bathroom. I turned the lights on in every room, then turned them off again when the brightness felt too exposed, too vulnerable. Nothing felt safe.

And then there was the statue.

It wasn‚Äôt here, of course‚Äînot physically. But I couldn‚Äôt stop seeing it in my mind: the jagged stone, the grotesque horns, and those eyes. God, those eyes. I could still feel their gaze crawling over me, cold and unrelenting, like I‚Äôd been marked.

I turned the radio on to drown out the silence, letting the static wash over me like a shield. But that only made it worse. The hiss of white noise filled the apartment, twisting into strange patterns, rising and falling like distant whispers. I leaned closer, straining to make sense of it, only to realize I didn‚Äôt want to know what it was saying.

Midnight came and went. The shadows seemed to grow darker, pressing closer, filling the spaces where the light didn‚Äôt quite reach. I felt stupid, paranoid, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I wasn‚Äôt alone.

I kept glancing over my shoulder, expecting‚Ä¶ something. A figure. A sound. A flicker of movement. But there was nothing. Just the silence and the shadows, stretching endlessly.

By 2 a.m., I‚Äôd given up trying to sleep. My bed felt too small, too exposed, like a stage in the middle of a vast, empty room. I sat on the couch instead, staring at the blank TV screen. I could see my reflection in the dark glass‚Äîpale, wide-eyed, disheveled. Behind me, the room stretched out in warped shadows, the edges of the reflection curling into something unrecognizable.

A knock at the door would‚Äôve been a relief. A creak of the floorboards, a voice‚Äîanything would‚Äôve been better than the oppressive nothingness pressing in on all sides.

But nothing came.

The hours dragged on, every second slower than the last. By the time the first gray light of dawn filtered through the blinds, I felt hollowed out, like the night had scooped something vital out of me and left a shell in its place.

Nothing had happened. Nothing overt, nothing concrete. But that was almost worse.

Because whatever was out there‚Äîwhatever I had glimpsed in that warehouse‚Äîdidn‚Äôt need to step into the light. It didn‚Äôt need to show itself. It was already here, in the air, in the silence, in the cold, crawling dread that still clung to me like a second skin.

I wasn‚Äôt alone. I didn‚Äôt know how I knew, but I did. Something was watching, waiting, patient. And as the first rays of sunlight crept into the room, I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was relief or resignation that finally made me close my eyes.

The days that followed the ritual were hell.

I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of the statue‚Äôs eyes burning into me, couldn‚Äôt shake the crushing weight of dread that had settled deep in my chest. It clung to me, followed me everywhere‚Äîthrough the streets, to the coffee shop, even in the shower. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Not even for a moment. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the jagged stone, the horns, and the faint, flickering light in its eyes.

I threw myself into research, desperate for answers. I started reading everything I could find about Moloch. The name appeared across cultures, whispered in different forms but always tied to the same thing: blood, fire, sacrifice. It wasn‚Äôt just ancient mythology. Moloch had been invoked throughout history, his presence tied to moments of unthinkable cruelty‚Äîwars, massacres, and rituals hidden from the public eye.

The more I read, the worse it got. The stories spoke of those who called upon Moloch not out of devotion, but out of desperation‚Äîpeople who would give anything to gain power, escape ruin, or satisfy their darkest desires. And every time, the cost was the same: lives, innocents, children.

I didn‚Äôt realize how much time had passed until I glanced at the clock on the fourth night and saw it was nearing 2 a.m. The apartment was silent, save for the faint hum of my desk lamp. The shadows seemed thicker than usual, pressing in at the edges of the room like they were waiting for me to turn my back.

I shook my head, rubbing my eyes. I told myself I was imagining things. I was just tired, sleep-deprived. But then I heard it.

Footsteps.

They came from the hallway outside my apartment‚Äîa slow, deliberate tread that sent a chill crawling up my spine. I froze, staring at the door, waiting for the sound to pass. But it didn‚Äôt. The footsteps stopped right outside my door.

The silence stretched, suffocating. My heart pounded in my chest as I crept toward the door, peering through the peephole. The hallway was empty.

I stood there for a long moment, my breath shallow, before finally stepping back. ‚ÄúGet a grip,‚Äù I muttered to myself. But the words felt hollow, like a lie I couldn‚Äôt quite believe.

I turned back to my desk, and that‚Äôs when I heard the first slam.

It came from the kitchen, a sharp, violent crack that echoed through the apartment. I spun around, heart hammering in my chest. The cabinet doors were wide open, their contents scattered across the counter and floor.

Another slam, this time from the bathroom. I darted to the doorway, flipping the light switch. The shower curtain was drawn closed, though I knew I‚Äôd left it open. My hand trembled as I reached for it, yanking it back. The tub was empty.

The sound of footsteps started again, heavier this time, echoing from the living room. I stepped out into the hallway, every nerve in my body on edge. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out, my voice cracking.

Nothing.

I stepped into the living room and froze.

Through the window, I saw a figure standing in the shadows just beyond the glass. It was barely illuminated by the faint light from a distant streetlamp, but I could make out the shape‚Äîa tall, broad figure cloaked in darkness, its face obscured. It didn‚Äôt move. It just stood there, staring.

I felt frozen, every muscle locked in place. And then, as if it realized I‚Äôd seen it, the figure turned and fled, disappearing into the shadows.

I stumbled back, my legs nearly giving out beneath me. I locked the window, drew the curtains, and leaned against the wall, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

I turned to leave the room and caught movement in the corner of my eye. The mirror above the fireplace.

I didn‚Äôt want to look. Every instinct screamed at me to run, to leave the apartment and never come back. But I forced myself to turn.

At first, the reflection showed only me‚Äîpale, trembling, staring into my own terrified eyes. But then something shifted behind me. A flicker of movement in the shadows.

I whipped around. The room was empty.

When I turned back to the mirror, the movement was gone. But the reflection wasn‚Äôt quite right. The shadows seemed deeper, darker, almost alive.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. I couldn‚Äôt. I sat in the corner of the room, my back to the wall, clutching the only weapon I could find‚Äîa kitchen knife. The apartment was silent, but the sense of being watched never left.

By dawn, I wasn‚Äôt sure if the fear I felt was mine‚Ä¶ or if something else had planted it there.

The morning brought no relief. The sunlight that streamed through the curtains felt pale and distant, like a cruel parody of comfort. My body ached from sitting on the floor all night, and my mind was fogged with exhaustion. But I was alive, and for now, the oppressive dread seemed to have loosened its grip.

I stumbled into the bathroom, desperate to wash the night away, even if only for a moment. The cold water on my face helped a little, numbing the terror that still lingered at the edges of my thoughts. As I straightened up and looked into the mirror, my reflection stared back, hollow-eyed and haggard.

I let out a shaky breath and turned away to grab a towel. When I looked back, the reflection was no longer mine.

It moved faster than I did, standing completely still while I recoiled, my breath caught in my throat. My reflection wasn‚Äôt me‚Äîit was staring directly into my eyes, its expression unreadable, its gaze sharp and knowing.

Then it smiled.

I stumbled back, my heart hammering in my chest. But the reflection didn‚Äôt move. It stayed in the mirror, locked in that eerie, unblinking grin. And then, it spoke.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so tired, Glenn.‚Äù

The voice was mine, but it wasn‚Äôt. It was softer, calmer, with an edge of something sinister curling around the edges of the words.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen it, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù the reflection continued. ‚ÄúThe truth. You felt it watching. You know what it wants.‚Äù

My legs felt weak, but I forced myself to speak. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you?‚Äù

It tilted its head, almost playfully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm you. Or maybe I‚Äôm not. Does it matter? You‚Äôre standing on the edge, Glenn, and you can feel it. The only question is whether you‚Äôre going to fall‚Ä¶ or jump.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave me alone,‚Äù I whispered, gripping the edge of the sink so tightly my knuckles turned white.

‚ÄúLeave you alone?‚Äù The reflection chuckled, a dry, hollow sound. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how this works. You opened the door, Glenn. You saw the eyes. It saw you.‚Äù

I shook my head, squeezing my eyes shut, but I could still hear it‚Äîmy own voice, relentless and invasive.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one way to end this,‚Äù it said, its tone dropping to a low, conspiratorial whisper. ‚ÄúYou need to find him.‚Äù

‚ÄúFind who?‚Äù I snapped, my voice cracking.

‚ÄúThe leader,‚Äù the reflection said, its grin widening. ‚ÄúThe one who led the ritual. The one who called Moloch‚Äôs name. You know where to find him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou will,‚Äù it interrupted, the grin vanishing in an instant. Its face was suddenly cold, stern. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find him. You‚Äôll bring him to Moloch. Offer him. You‚Äôll feel the peace you‚Äôve been chasing ever since you stepped into that warehouse. You‚Äôll finally be free.‚Äù

I stared at the mirror, my chest heaving. ‚ÄúNo. No, I‚Äôm not doing that. I‚Äôm not a murderer.‚Äù

The reflection didn‚Äôt smile this time. It simply stared at me with those unblinking eyes, its face unreadable.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre already marked,‚Äù it said softly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre already his. The only way to stop the screaming is to listen.‚Äù

And then it was gone.

My own reflection stared back at me, pale and shaking, but otherwise normal. The bathroom was silent, save for the faint drip of the faucet.

I stumbled out of the room, my hands trembling as I gripped the edge of the kitchen counter to steady myself. The reflection‚Äôs words echoed in my mind, relentless and inescapable.

You‚Äôll feel peace. You‚Äôll finally be free.

I didn‚Äôt want to believe it. I didn‚Äôt want to even consider it. But deep down, in the part of me that had been twisted and hollowed out by fear, a tiny, treacherous thought began to take root.

What if it was right?

The days that followed were a haze of resistance and desperation. I fought against the words that echoed in my mind, the image of my own reflection speaking those terrible things to me. I told myself it wasn‚Äôt real. I was sleep-deprived, paranoid, imagining things. But no matter how much I tried to rationalize it, the cold truth lingered at the edge of my thoughts.

I tried everything to distract myself. I threw myself back into my research, combing through every book, every forum, every scrap of information about Moloch. But it only made things worse. The stories I found spoke of those who tried to resist the god‚Äôs influence. They always failed.

At night, the dread returned. The shadows seemed darker, the silence heavier. The apartment felt alive, as though something unseen was watching, waiting for me to break. The strange occurrences continued‚Äîdoors creaking open when I knew I had closed them, faint footsteps in the hallway, glimpses of movement in the corner of my eye.

The worst were the mirrors. I couldn‚Äôt look at them anymore. Every time I passed one, I felt its pull, like it was calling out to me, daring me to look again. I covered them with sheets, but it didn‚Äôt help. The reflection‚Äôs voice still haunted me.

‚ÄúYou know what you need to do.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find peace.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt fight him.‚Äù

I refused to give in. I told myself I was stronger than this, that I wouldn‚Äôt become a pawn in whatever twisted game I‚Äôd stumbled into. But my resolve was hollow. The fear gnawed at me, consuming every waking thought.

I didn‚Äôt sleep. I didn‚Äôt eat. The walls of my apartment closed in, suffocating. I couldn‚Äôt stay there anymore, but the thought of going outside, of facing the world, felt just as unbearable.

On the fifth night, I finally broke.

It was almost midnight when I left the apartment. The city felt alien, the streets empty and lifeless. Even the distant hum of traffic seemed muted, swallowed by the oppressive quiet.

I didn‚Äôt know exactly why I was heading back to the warehouse. Maybe it was desperation, a need to confront whatever had been set in motion that night. Or maybe it was something worse‚Äîan invisible pull, guiding me back to the statue.

The warehouse loomed ahead, dark and silent, its broken windows like empty, staring eyes. I hesitated at the door, my breath visible in the cold night air. For a moment, I considered turning back. But then I heard it.

A faint, almost imperceptible sound, like a whisper carried on the wind. I couldn‚Äôt make out the words, but the tone was clear‚Äîurgent, commanding.

I stepped inside.

The air was cold and stale, the kind of cold that sinks into your bones and stays there. My footsteps echoed as I made my way across the empty floor, each step feeling heavier than the last.

The statue was still there, standing in the center of the room like a sentinel. Its grotesque form seemed larger than I remembered, its jagged features more menacing. The horns, the open mouth, the carved musculature‚Äîit was monstrous, but it was the eyes that drew me in.

They were empty, lifeless holes, yet they seemed to see me, to follow my every move. I felt their weight pressing down on me, cold and suffocating.

I stopped a few feet away, my heart pounding. I didn‚Äôt know what I expected to happen. Maybe I thought the reflection‚Äôs voice would return, or that the statue would spring to life. But the room was silent, save for the sound of my own ragged breathing.

And yet, the dread didn‚Äôt fade. If anything, it grew stronger, coiling around me like a vice.

‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù I whispered, my voice trembling.

The statue didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt respond. But the air felt heavier, as though the room itself was listening.

I stepped closer, my legs shaking. ‚ÄúIs this what you wanted? For me to come here? For me to‚Ä¶‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt finish the sentence. The weight of the words was too much.

And then, as I stood there, staring into those empty eyes, I felt it. A presence. Not physical, not visible, but undeniable. It was there, all around me, filling the space with an overwhelming sense of power and malice.

I fell to my knees, my breath hitching in my throat. The cold dread that had followed me for days was nothing compared to this. It was like staring into the abyss and feeling it stare back, ancient and hungry.

For the first time since this nightmare began, I realized how small I was. How powerless.

And yet, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to leave. The reflection‚Äôs voice echoed in my mind, soft and insidious.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find peace.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt believe it. But I couldn‚Äôt help wondering if it was right.

As I knelt there, the crushing weight of the statue‚Äôs presence pressing down on me, I heard footsteps. Slow, deliberate, echoing through the warehouse.

I turned, my body stiff with dread, and saw the ritual leader step out of the shadows. He looked different without the theatrics of the ceremony‚Äîno hood, no dramatic gestures. Just a man, plain and unremarkable, yet his eyes held something unnatural. They gleamed with the kind of certainty that comes only from absolute belief, and in that moment, I hated him.

‚ÄúWhy are you here?‚Äù he asked, his voice calm, almost conversational.

The rage hit me like a tidal wave, sudden and overwhelming. I surged to my feet, my fists clenched so tightly my nails bit into my palms. ‚ÄúWhat did you do to me?‚Äù I shouted. My voice echoed off the walls, wild and raw. ‚ÄúWhat the hell did you summon that night? What is this thing that‚Äôs been watching me, haunting me?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt flinch. If anything, he seemed amused, his lips curling into a faint smile. ‚ÄúYou felt it, didn‚Äôt you? His gaze. His power.‚Äù He stepped closer, his presence suffocating. ‚ÄúMoloch sees you now. You‚Äôve been touched by him. There‚Äôs no turning back.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù I snapped, my voice cracking. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. You think this is some kind of gift? It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a curse.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd yet you came here,‚Äù he said, his tone maddeningly calm. ‚ÄúWhy? Because you know what you need to do. You‚Äôve seen the truth. You‚Äôve heard it, haven‚Äôt you? That little whisper in your mind, telling you the way out.‚Äù

He knew. Somehow, he knew about the reflection, about the voice. My fists trembled, and I wanted to hit him, to wipe that smug look off his face. But I couldn‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre special?‚Äù he continued, circling me like a predator. ‚ÄúYou think you can defy Him? You‚Äôre nothing, Glenn. Just another pawn in the grand design. The only choice you have is how you‚Äôll play your part. Will you stand in defiance and be broken? Or will you submit and find peace?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. ‚ÄúHow do you know my name..? I didn‚Äôt ask for this!‚Äù I roared. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about your god, your rituals, your twisted faith. I just want my life back!‚Äù

The tension in the room was unbearable, suffocating. My chest heaved, my vision blurred with tears of frustration and exhaustion. And in that moment, I did something I hadn‚Äôt done in years‚ÄîI prayed.

I prayed for the Piper.

I begged, silently and desperately, for him to appear, to play his pipes, to save me from this nightmare. I prayed for the haunting weight in my chest to lift, for the unrelenting eyes to look away, for this man, this monster, to be silenced.

But he never came.

The warehouse remained silent, the only sound the leader‚Äôs steady breathing and my own ragged gasps. The realization hit me like a punch to the gut: no one was coming to save me.

The leader saw the defeat in my eyes and stepped closer, his voice softening into something almost gentle. ‚ÄúYou can end this, Glenn. You don‚Äôt have to keep suffering. All it takes is one act. One offering. You know who I am. You know what needs to be done. Moloch will accept it, and you‚Äôll finally be free.‚Äù

I stared at him, my mind racing. It would be so easy. One moment of violence, and it would all be over. The haunting, the fear, the suffocating dread‚Äîit would stop.

I took a step forward, my fists trembling at my sides. The leader didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt resist. He just stood there, his expression serene, as though he had already won.

But then, at the breaking point, something inside me shifted.

I thought of Kiara, of the weight she carried every day for the lives she‚Äôd taken. I thought of Evan Reed, of the way the Piper had changed his path, not by force but by showing him the cost of his choices. I thought of every story I‚Äôd uncovered about those who had been given the chance to turn away from the darkness‚Äîand those who hadn‚Äôt.

And I thought of myself.

I knew what this choice would mean. If I gave in, I might find peace, but it wouldn‚Äôt be real. It would be built on blood, on a piece of myself that I would never get back.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

The leader frowned. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

I took a step back, then another, shaking my head. ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm not doing this. I‚Äôm not like you. I won‚Äôt be like you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre throwing away your only chance,‚Äù he said, his voice hardening. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll suffer for the rest of your life. You‚Äôll never be free.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I said, my voice steadier now. ‚ÄúBut at least I‚Äôll still have my soul.‚Äù

I turned and walked away. Surprisingly, he allowed me to leave.

As I reached the door, I heard it: the faintest sound, almost imperceptible, carried on the breeze. The soft, haunting melody of pipes, just for a moment.

The weight in my chest loosened, and the shadows didn‚Äôt feel as heavy. For the first time in days, I felt calm.

And then I went home, and I slept.

We had a lovely time (talked for nearly 7 hours), with him saying that I am very intelligent and beautiful. We kissed and heavily made out before parting. He said that he really enjoyed spending time with me and wants to see me again.

Two days ago, he messaged me in the app that he had a fantastic date and even though he was exhausted because he couldn't get any sleep, that the date with me was 100% worth it.

You know who all that shit is for? IT'S FOR PARENTS WHO KEEP GETTING WOKEN UP BY THEIR KIDS. It isn't even for getting autistic kids to sleep either! It's for getting them to quit annoying their parents during the night!

Okay so now for the actual info because I know you messed up fuckers love that sort of thing. I've figured out that autistic people are notorious for sleep issues. We have an overactive nervous system, often more stressed out than others, not to mention the various issues with neurotransmitter signalling that vary from individual to individual. It's been clinically proven that autistic people get 20% less REM sleep than neurotypicals and have a way higher incidence of sleep disturbances.

I've had a blood test which came back with every metric in healthy range, I've bought a bedjet to keep my bed at The Optimal Temperature (bedjet is autism certified btw it even doubles as a white noise generator), I've tried basically all the sleep botanicals, I've tried the special magnesium, I've tried ibuprofen, I've tried melatonin.

1h00gk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h00gk7/considering_getting_back_with_my_ex/,Considering getting back with my ex,"I (22M) and considering getting back with my ex (21F). 

I‚Äôve known her for 5 years + now and somehow we keep being drawn to each other. We spoke for a while in a romantic way before moving away to University where she was in the room above me by complete coincidence. We got together after a few months of messing about and had about a year and a half relationship. 

The relationship was very good the majority of the time. When it was bad it was bad. We were both loyal during our time together but I caught her in a few lies involving other people that had happened prior to our relationship, she took responsibility and apologised for these. I decided to move on from them as it was before we were together and although we were speaking she wasn‚Äôt my girlfriend so I felt I couldn‚Äôt hold it against her. 

Things became difficult when I decided to study abroad for a year in Australia. I grew up in poverty in a single parent household so I jumped at the opportunity and not once did she ask me to not go, she understood my perspective and didn‚Äôt want me to lose out on the life experience. The final 6 months of our relationship was generally good, issues cropped up as time went on and I think she subconsciously pulled away emotionally to protect herself as she knew I was moving away. I don‚Äôt blame her for this as it wouldn‚Äôt be easy being in her shoes. There was times that she would cause issues over nothing which wasn‚Äôt good for me and this pushed me away over time. I split up with her before I moved away as I didn‚Äôt want to take this into a new lifestyle. I wasn‚Äôt really bothered about other women I just didn‚Äôt see it to be healthy for me especially in what would‚Äôve became a long-distance scenario as we‚Äôre from Europe. 

It was difficult for me processing the break up while on the other side of the planet, alone at 20. I got through it though and accepted she wouldn‚Äôt be apart of my life anymore. I moved on with my life and never really felt a like the one we had. I wasn‚Äôt looking to fill a hole I just accepted it wasn‚Äôt going to be the same. 

We went over a year with no contact with each other whatsoever until I bumped into her in the street about a month after returning to my city. I spoke to her and we grabbed a coffee. She was in a new relationship at this point. She apologised to me and said in hindsight she needed me to split up with her to grow in herself. That she needed the lessons from that to be able to move forwards and grow as a person, she felt shame from her actions but wouldn‚Äôt change them. She had strong father issues which affected our relationship as she would push these issues onto me, having somewhat of an independent woman mentality which was pushed to her by her mum growing up. She seems to have genuinely taken the time to reflect on herself and grow as a person. I was extremely surprised. Not long after that she ended her relationship and contacted me. We‚Äôve been seeing each other since and to be totally honest I‚Äôve really enjoyed our time together. Although, I‚Äôm wary of the fact she‚Äôs just got out of a relationship recently and question whether it seems too good to be true.

It‚Äôs funny but I‚Äôm also conscious of having father and mother issues growing up myself. I find myself attached to women quite easily over basic nice treatment as I didn‚Äôt really receive this growing up and functioned independently from around 14. I‚Äôve never really seen functional relationships so my view is tainted. What do I do?

For further context. I don‚Äôt have issues in the dating world, I don‚Äôt enjoy sleeping around as it makes me feel bad spiritually. I prefer to put my energy into my long term goals as I‚Äôm in my final year of completing my degree, outside of that I get paid to travel and compete in my hobby and work daily from my laptop too.

1h00feu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkNarrations/comments/1h00feu/i_38f_have_been_keeping_a_secret_from_my_43f/,"I (38F) have been keeping a secret from my (43F) friend/coworker about her (42M) husband, and it's tearing me apart. How do I navigate this without destroying lives?","Hello Reddit. This has been weighing on my conscious for over a year now, and I'm honestly not sure how to handle it. It's long, so settle in, grab a tea/coffee/whiskey and enjoy my mental anguish.

I (38f) met my friend Dave (42m) about 4 years ago in an online gaming forum. During the entire time we talked, I became friends with his wife Brenda (43f), and he became friends with my fianc√© Mikel (38m). I live by the rule in a relationship that if there is conversation that I wouldn't feel comfortable showing my significant other, then I don't need to be having that conversation. At no point did Dave ever cross a line with me, nor was there ever inappropriate conversation. This is important.

About a year and a half ago (summertime) Mikel got a big promotion and we hosted a fun weekend long celebration at our home. We invited Dave and Brenda, who live 5 hours from us, and this was the first time we actually met them in person. I instantly connected with Brenda, as she was so authentic and sweet. We all got along well, and even started talking about doing future get-togethers and vacations. It seemed perfect. At this time my company was doing major layoffs and I was looking for a new career. Brenda has worked at a remote company for over a decade and recommended I apply. After a few intense interviews, I was hired.

Quick side note: Dave had been injured in work related accident that had gone to court, he sued and won. He was permanently disabled because of the accident and can no longer work at his profession. That, along with a large life insurance policy from his parents, he is financially set for life. He stays home and raises their daughter Lia (5), while Brenda does her remote work from the house as well.

So, a little over a year ago (during the fall, a few months after the celebration weekend) Dave and Brenda were getting ready to take their daughter Lia (5) on a vacation. Before they left for the airport, Dave said he needed to talk to me, it was urgent, so I stepped away to take the call. Dave then told me he had literally nobody else to talk to this about, and was deeply depressed, and needed to confide in me as a friend. *I.. really wish he hadn't.*

He told me that the night before he had gotten into a huge fight with who he calls his best friend, Rachel (41f). I had heard about Rachel but never met her, and didn't know too much about her, to be honest. What I did know: Dave, Brenda and Rachel had been friends in college (approximately 20 year long friendship), she had visited at Dave and Brenda's house several times over the years, and that Rachel allegedly had been in a string of bad relationships of which Dave had had to bail her out financially a few times. That's about it.

Here comes the information that I wish Dave hadn't told me, as it has completely changed how I view my friend: Dave told me that Rachel confessed to him the night before that she knew he was attracted to her. Yes, she is gorgeous. Dave said he has always been attracted to her physically, but mentally her personality (specifically her shallowness) was a huge turnoff for him. Some unkind things were said about Brenda ""letting herself go"" since having Lia, which disgusted me. He then said Rachel confessed that she is frustrated with her never-ending chain of bad relationships and wants to finally settle down. She knows he is wealthy and can give her the life she feels she deserves. She wants him to leave Brenda and Lia, move to Rachel's city, buy her a large house, and let her be his trophy wife. (I choked back a laugh at this because I literally thought it was a joke. Seriously?) She admits to NOT being physically attracted to him (Okay, who says things like that?!), but knows she can satisfy him and he can give her the lifestyle she deserves. She just demands that he has to completely cut off the life he has now, including all friends and family, and be with her. What is worse, Rachel has been planning this for literally YEARS. Sitting in their home, eating their food, drinking their wine, holding Lia, laughing with Brenda, all while planning this.

I was floored. I asked what Brenda thought of all this. He said he didn't tell her. I asked him how Rachel took it when he told her to F- off. He said he didn't. He doesn't want to lose her as a friend and he even considered her proposition. *I felt sick.*

I told him I was shocked, and to me, even if he decides not to take Rachel up on it, this is a betrayal to Brenda. Dave explained that while his and my conversations consisted of gaming, stupid memes, and planning potential couples vacations, his conversations with Rachel were emotional and raw. They spoke for hours on end, every single day, while he was caring for Lia, and while Brenda was working in the next room. Ok, ewwwww. Stop.

He asked my opinion, and I told him he has 2 options: either leave Brenda, or completely break off all contact with Rachel and focus on his marriage.. but since he asked, in my opinion Brenda needed to know. Especially since she considered Rachel a friend, and knowing that Rachel wants to screw over Brenda and Lia. Seriously typing this disgusts me.

After the call ended I told Mikel about it. He was as shocked as I was, but asked what I was going to do. I just sat there trying to digest what I had just heard.

Dave, Brenda and Lia went on their vacation. During this time we didn't communicate. When he got back he told me that he had cut Rachel off, but refused to tell Brenda about it. Ok, fine whatever. I don't agree with his action to not tell her, but It's not my life, not my relationship. He asked for advice and I gave it. I told him that in my eyes, he had betrayed his wife, whether physically or not, and I still felt that Brenda deserved to know.

Almost immediately I felt myself pulling away from Dave. My image of him was damaged. When I interact with Brenda online for work, I'm professional and friendly, but it's painful keeping this secret. However, as time passed I began to think that perhaps this was over. Dave had just made a stupid mistake and was just thinking about what could be. He didn't actually leave her, right? And most importantly, he cut Rachel out.

Dave and I begin talking a bit more. I actually thought maybe things can go back to the way they were. Since didn't actually physically cheat, maybe it's best that Brenda doesn't know, for her own mental health and happiness. Maybe we can move past this. So many thoughts going through my mind. SO many ways of rationalizing this. The mental gymnastics were Olympics level impressive.

Then about a month ago he drops the bomb. He tells me that Rachel and he are talking again. She allegedly begged him for forgiveness, and cried that she is going through another horrible breakup and needs his friendship, or else she ""doesn't know what she might do"". He said he is going to keep her at arms length, but SHE NEEEEEDS HIM. He will just be there for her a little bit, but it won't be like it was before. Oh holy knight...

To my chagrin (love that word), as the weeks pass he begins to mention her more and more. I tell him I don't want to hear about her, and when he keeps going I finally snap and tell him not to mention her to me at all. I'm so pissed that he is talking to her again, and that he doesn't care about how me knowing this is putting more guilt and strain in my mind especially when I have to interact with HIS WIFE. It's completely unfair that he told me about his ""situationship"" with Rachel, knowing that I consider Brenda a friend, and that we work together EVERY DAY. I've begged him to tell Brenda about it. She has the right to decide if she wants to stay. And most of all that he is actively still friends with a woman who wishes hurt and pain on his wife and little girl. How do you sleep at night sir...

Dave still talks about planning vacations together with Mikel and I, but I don't even respond. Honestly I don't see how I can sit at dinner with them and keep quiet, especially if Rachel were to get brought up in conversation, and especially if wine is involved. and let's be honest, there WILL BE WINE. I have one of those faces that speaks my mind without saying a word, which is why I do better working remote, vs client facing.

I dread the day when/if either Dave or Brenda say that Rachel is coming to visit them again. I can pretend it won't happen, but let's be honest. Dave is a complete moron who managed to somehow miraculously prevent his marriage from going up in flames, only to soak himself in gasoline and open the door to the walking, talking, ""gorgeous yet shallow"" lit match.

Reddit: help me. I want to cut him out completely because I am so disgusted by his actions, but I know Brenda will be upset and drill me about it. Especially since they have been planning a trip to Europe for next year and wanting us to come. Should I just tell her that we had a falling out? Should I find a way to hint to Brenda not to trust Rachel? I didn't even want to know ANY of this, and I'm so pissed that he dumped this on me. We were friends, but not *that* type of friend.

As for Brenda, I would want to know if I were friends with and playing host to a girl who wanted to steal my husband, and the father of my child. But I'm also concerned about my job, my livelihood. She's been with the company over 10 years and I've only been a year. I've kept this secret from her for so long. If I say something, can it affect my employment? Should I just pull away from them and when asked make some lame excuse like I am too busy?

TLDR: Friend confides in me that he is considering leaving his marriage for mutual friend of theirs. Decides not to and cuts friend out. However, recently started up friendship with this girl again. His wife is a friend and coworker of mine.",18,1732585963.0,MarkNarrations,9,0.96,False

My wife and I began our relationship in March 2011. We both had a history of terrible relationships. Being both the victim and the perpetrator. I had just moved back home after a year in a big city. We had always been into each other since we had met years before, but had never found a way to make it work. 

A few months after I was home, we had reconnected. I knew she was seeing other people, but was content with dating her and eventually wanted to shoot my shot. When I first asked her to be mine, she said no. Afraid that she was just a rebound. 

When she finally said yes, I knew she still had a lot a lot of loose ends. I‚Äôm sure she hadn‚Äôt ended all of her relationships after starting an exclusive one with me, but I wanted to believe she would eventually cut off from the others. And I believed for a time she did. We moved fast, after a couple short months, we were already living together. In July of that year, I took her on a vacation with me to NC. It was on this vacation where I discovered sexual conversations between her and another man. I confronted her and was furious. She begged me to stay. Even got her mom to send me a message about how she stayed after my wife‚Äôs dad cheated and they were still happily married. I gave her another shot. 

In these early stages, two other instances of dishonesty occurred. When my phone busted, she let me have her old one. In her notes on that phone was a message clearly intended for a previous flame of hers communicating an immense desire for them. 

Another instance, I came home unexpectedly during a lunch break and discovered another man on my couch playing songs on a guitar for her. I was clearly interrupting something. 

Both of those were put behind me because we were still not even a year in, and each time she communicated that she would stop, she wouldn‚Äôt do this to me again. 

For a very long time, I don‚Äôt think she did. At least as far as I know. We dated for years with no problems. We signed leases on several apartments, and worked together at her family‚Äôs studio for a long time. After 5 years, I asked her to marry me in front of a ton of people. She wanted this, very badly. We married the next year, and a year later, we discovered that she was pregnant. We had a beautiful baby girl, and life seemed perfect.

The story has many ups and downs from here. The studio her family invested everything in crumbled and we both lost our jobs. With the new child, and no jobs, we could no longer afford an apartment. We had to move into my parents house for a time. 

After this, I found a full time big boy job. She remained a stay at home mom. Then COVID happened. And my wife‚Äôs self image began to plummet. She gained weight, and began the long journey toward hating herself and becoming very depressed. I noticed her beginning to have conversations with an old friend. I‚Äôd have never been concerned if these conversations weren‚Äôt happening via Snapchat. And in addition, she grew distant from me. We went almost a year without having sex. 

I had resolved that we needed a boost. So I began to work many hours of OT so that we could eventually afford a house. She began to take charge of her life in small ways. Starting a podcast with her sister, joining a band, and being the biggest advocate for finding us a house. After a few years, I had finally saved enough to buy a home of our own which she chose. After we moved, things started to seem better again. 

But she was having more conversations with men. All of whom she swore were friends, but this began to scape at old wounds and my trust in her began to falter. 

She began floating between remote full time jobs and I was still working mine from home. However her anxiety and depression became severe. She hated her job and her boss, and would vent to me while I was trying to work. She would then get angry at me for being distant and not listening. 

This lead me to find a non-remote job that paid more. However there was a transition period that landed us without benefits for a few months. The medication she was taking for her anxiety became too expensive and for a time she was off of it and completely unhinged. 

This lead us to the end of last year where two things happened:

1.  I discovered she had an OF account, however no posts. She had also admitted to having conversations with men that expressed her sexual desires. But remained firm that she had feelings for none of them and that they were all just friends.

This had shaken what trust I had left. I became jealous and paranoid of most of the conversations she was having with other men. This threatened her autonomy and made it difficult for her to make friends. I will own that. 

2.  Her mental health took a severe turn. She was threatening suicide, and spending most of her days in bed doom scrolling. There were pockets of time where she was fine and things seemed good, but most of the time she was manic, depressed, angry, and suicidal. In front of our daughter no less.

Late last year she entered a program for those struggling with mental health. She emerged from this program with tools and resources to combat what she was going. While there were many bad days on her road to recovery, she slowly became a much better and more complete person. 

Fast forward to August. We had ups and downs, but things were getting better.  My jealousy of her male friendships was still a sore spot, as well as an increasing concern with money. She was spending way more than we had and would let her subscriptions become out of control. 

As I type this, I‚Äôm realizing more fully that what was to come was inevitable. One of her guy friends that she stayed in touch with had also gone through the program she went through. She began to meet with him secretively at a coffee shop. To this day, she says these meetings were above board, but flirty. That she couldn‚Äôt tell me of these meetings because it‚Äôd be just another guy friend that I‚Äôd not be able to accept. At some point, they‚Äôd realized these meetings needed to stop. And for a time they did. Until August when they had reconnected. Conversations were immediately flirty. She would say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to take a shower‚Äù and he would say things like ‚Äúno pics?‚Äù And then ‚ÄúSC sent‚Äù. This led to a meeting at a bar during the day while I was at work. They kissed. Some time later, she invited him into our house to ‚Äúdiscuss the kiss‚Äù. One thing led to another, and they had sex. I would not discover these texts until just two weeks ago from writing this when I went through her phone, confronted her about everything, and finally coaxed the truth out of her.

Many things about this story hurt, to a great degree. That while I was working hard to support our family and protect our daughter from her crisis, she emerged from program beginning to lie to me about meeting with the man she would eventually cheat on me with. 

She would tell her sister and her mom only of my jealousy problems, but failed to mention even to them that she had a problem which she now calls an addiction to attention from men. 

Since discovering the affair, she has sworn that she will show up for me every day, and fight for our marriage. She has deleted Snapchat, and cutoff all contact with her AP as well as every other man I was suspicious of. She compares her addiction to attention as a drug, a bad habit that she quit cold turkey and that she‚Äôs never felt better for it. 

She is walking the walk, and doing the work. She has allowed full transparency and wants to do anything it takes for me to trust her again. We‚Äôve been to couple counseling a few times. We are each seeking our own individual therapy. 

At this stage, things could be much worse. I‚Äôve read stories of partners that are not near as invested as it seems my wife is in repairing the damage she caused, and showing up for me, assuring me daily she will never let this happen again. 

I am filled with emotions. I am angry, hurt, and the daily pain of this betrayal has killed my motivation at work, and ruined my ability to sleep. 

The first week, I was angry at the thought of someone else bedding my wife. The second, I am scared out of my mind that I‚Äôm rushing too fast back into something that feels genuinely different, better. That she is taking this time to improve herself, take ownership for what she did, and show up for me and fight for me has not gone unnoticed. 

I just wish it didn‚Äôt take shattering me into a million pieces to finally realize what changes were needed. 

I am mourning the loss of our marriage as it was, and am trying to embrace the idea of what our marriage could be, scared out of my mind that I‚Äôm just going to get hurt again. ",6,1732585875.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,2,0.8,False

Not our type.

We don't know much about the Fallsmead vibe, but the school zone seems extremely solid. We are a biracial family and think it's a bit more ethnically diverse toward Rockville.

Comute is good in either neighborhood. Price is at our limit around $1 mil. Our daughter is 3, so still have a year or two to figure it out. 

I looked up the demographics of the area, and the big advantage that Kentlands have is that there are a lot more little kids (based on the 2022 census).

I just finished the book and I didn‚Äôt like it but I didn‚Äôt hate it either. I started reading it thinking it was this good horror book but then it dove into fantasy?‚Ä¶idek what I was expecting but it wasn‚Äôt this. The overall story was good but I had a few gripes with it. 

1. Mouse‚Äôs breakup with her boyfriend was completely irrelevant and should have cut it out. I completely forgot about it until it was brought up again when she was at the coffee shop. Like I get adding backstories but this wasn‚Äôt needed. 

2. What was up with phone call to the secret society/ the weird people who were at the funeral? The weird people at the funeral kept getting brought up but it didn‚Äôt add much to the story. The dad already said it was a closed casket and that Cotgrave died outside so she could have put the ‚Äúbig twist‚Äù together without having the hint from the guy on the phone. 

3. This is a gripe that I have with all authors. Adding characters towards the end of a book just to kill them off because they were only added to keep the story moving. 

4. Why not have her find the Green book? It would have explained so much because everything that Mouse was going off of was the speculation of an old man losing it. 

5. The ending felt lazy. And most of the explanations fell flat for me. All of the build up just for that. 

I‚Äôve read some of the authors other books and I really liked them but this isn‚Äôt one I can say I liked. I did enjoy the overall story but when I read the descriptions I thought I was getting this mystery horror book but it wasn‚Äôt that at all. The only thing that could be considered scary was the deer in the tree before it went down the fantasy path. Also, how the fuck did that deer get in the tree? Did Anna put it there? Someone with thumbs had to put it there. Or did it float in place or use magic since magic apparently works in both worlds?

My car does not have a ""living space"", and I'd like to get out and take advantage of some climate controlled space and maybe plug in my power station.

This is a medium-to-small city, btw.

I'll have a Planet Fitness membership, so I figure I can spend a solid hour in there every day, maybe 2 hours. The city also has a modest makerspace, so I might get a membership there and do some tinkering. Immediately after work I can go to a public library, but they all close at 7pm. There is also one rock climbing gym, so I can consider going there sometimes. Coffee shops are also a classic option, though I've never just hung out in one with my laptop before.

I think my real saving grace is that there is a big (private) university that I can park near and hopefully I'll be able to just waltz on in to their buildings and lounge around in some study areas. It says their library is accessible to the public and open until the late evening. And if I'm lucky maybe I can even find microwaves somewhere for hot meals!

Initially, the mycelium colonized very quickly, and I added more coffee grounds every 3‚Äì4 days. However, the growth has slowed down recently.

Two weeks ago, I had a contamination issue, which I addressed by removing the contaminated grounds with a spoon and replacing them with fresh ones. The mycelium successfully colonized the new grounds, and I haven‚Äôt noticed any further signs of contamination since.

The temperature here ranges from around 20¬∞C at night to a maximum of close to 30¬∞C on warmer days. I keep the container sealed with a lid, which has two small holes covered with micropore tape. I only open it every 2‚Äì3 days to check on the growth and add more coffee grounds if needed.

So yesterday was my boyfriends siblings birthday and we had spent the whole day setting up the house for their birthday, everything was going well.

I did that thing girls do when they‚Äôre drunk and started spilling all my emotions about how much I love his mom for like 30 minutes.

My stomach dropped, and then I was stuck feeling that toxic shame I haven‚Äôt in what feels like a long time. I have logic and I know why they aren‚Äôt coming over as much, it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt wanna deal with how stressful and awkward it is talking to me. That must be what it is.

I‚Äôm trying to have the benefit of the doubt and speak the mantras: everyone is different. It‚Äôs not a depiction of your worth if people don‚Äôt come over to chat.

I wouldn‚Äôt even say I‚Äôm awkward, I just go through stressful hell when talking to these people and I feel so much pressure and people pleasing energy.

I don‚Äôt wanna feel this feeling that there is something deeply wrong with me that separates me from the entire world completely causing everyone to look at me differently and dislike me.

However, hearing him say that made me feel sad and sick inside. Like why do people hate looking at me in the eyes? What did I do wrong? I have been trying to sort through my trauma and heal. After years of work and progress in that it sucks im still here feeling stuck and dealing with it at all. When will I not? Am I that bad? I try really hard to be a good person but what is that good person just an unbearable annoyance of existence? I hate talking to these people, maybe they hate it just as much because they can sense my discomfort?

Will people start wanting to chat with me when im healed? Will I realize that it doesn‚Äôt mean what I think it does and brush it off? Why does it hurt so bad?

1gzzvy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sasquatch_Nazi/comments/1gzzvy3/horrifying_sasquatch_encounter_the_macon_county/,"HORRIFYING SASQUATCH ENCOUNTER:  The Macon County Sasquatch, Pt. 1","I received an email from an associate, good old ‚ÄúBig Cock from Table Rock‚Äù, or ‚ÄúBC‚Äù for short, referring a Sasquatch nuisance case to me. Apparently, there was a farmer down in Macon County that was having livestock go missing. He was asking for some help to put a stop to this. At first he assumed that since most of the missing animals were chickens and rabbits the perpetrator was most likely a fox, coyote, or a bobcat. But then something happened to change the farmer‚Äôs mind. 

See, this farmer was staking out his critter pens by laying up between two big bales of hay. He was armed with a shotgun loaded with 00 buckshot shells. He was expecting to kill the thief with it. But as it turned out, that shotgun would be no match for this thief.

A little past 2:00 a.m. while staking out the animal pens, the farmer had drifted off to sleep. He was abruptly awakened by the alarmed sounds of his chickens. He immediately raised up a bit and raised his shotgun toward the chicken coup. At first he did not see anything. The coup itself stands 5‚Äô high, and runs about 20‚Äô long. It houses 30 chickens normally. But by now the count was down to 23. 

The farmer could not see anything. It was dark, of course, but there was enough light emitted by the full moon high in the night sky above to illuminate the coup and surrounding area. The farmer figured that the interloper was on the other side of the coup. He considered changing position in order to intercept and dispatch the invader before it got inside the coup. Then suddenly, the trespassing creature stood up. It was clearly on the opposite side of the chicken coop. And it was HUGE. 

It was on two legs. It‚Äôs legs and pelvic areas were hidden behind the chicken coop. It‚Äôs stomach is the first thing you see standing above the coup. The farmer was awestruck. He described the creature as bipedal and standing at least 14‚Äô tall. It had very broad shoulders, probably 7 feet across. It was covered in long and matted black hair, had a prominent brow ridge, and dark sunken eyes. 

After standing up, the farmer says the creature forcefully opened the roof of chicken house roosting area, stuck its huge arm inside, grabbed 2 chickens and pulled them out, then returned the roof back to its original position. The beast then looked around and walked away heading to the wood line approximately 100 yards to the east. The farmer never moved nor made a sound. He was too frightened to announce his presence. He watched the monster retreat into the woods with his chickens. Then he waited a few more minutes before moving out of fear that the monster may still be nearby and may see him. He was finally able to muster the courage to shimmy out from between the hay bales, then he ran all the way back to his house. He went inside, locked the doors, and sat in the living room the rest of the night with his shotgun at the ready in case the creature returned. 

The farmer immediately knew it was a Sasquatch. They are not common in this area, but there have been cases of them moving up and down the Flint River valley. And that is exactly where the farmer‚Äôs property is situated. The fact is, there was nothing else this creature could have been. It was a big ‚Äúhairy man‚Äù. And it perfectly fits the description of other Sasquatch seen in the valley over the years. The farmer had heard the stories but did not believe them before tonight. As unsettling as the sighting was for him, the one thing that worried him more than anything else was how BIG the thing was. He knew that there was no way his shotgun, or any other gun in his safe, was big enough to stop an animal that size. He figured it would take an elephant gun, minimum, to kill that thing. 

The poor farmer was at a loss for what to do. He could not let the creature keep stealing his animals. Plus, he felt like the Sasquatch may be a threat to his family. He wanted it gone. He just did not know how to do it. So he made some phone calls to the families who had members who had seen these things in the past. Of course, his calls and the story he told were subjected to scrutiny and laughter by most. After a couple days of this the farmer got nowhere, save for succeeding in ruining his reputation as a sober, standup man in the community. 

A week and a half later, and several chickens and 2 calves lighter, the farmer received an unsigned note in his mailbox. There was no return address. The note said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen it too. It‚Äôs a Bigfoot. It‚Äôs real. If you need help, then call me. My number is XXX-XXX-XXXX (redacted)‚Äù. The farmer was at wits end and immediately called the number. It turned out to be another farmer in the area, with property on the other side of the river. 

The other farmer had a very similar tale to his: a large, hairy bipedal monster showed up and started stealing his animals. It turned out that this other farmer had a nephew who is into Bigfoot and other creepy things. He had some contacts with Bigfoot hunters who would come out and remove these animals from your property. The other farmer told him that he would be happy to get his nephew involved to help him run off the Bigfoot if he likes. The farmer readily agreed! 

The next day the other farmer‚Äôs nephew visited the troubled farmer. He listened to the farmer‚Äôs story intently and inspected the area where the Bigfoot was seen. They even found a footprint. The nephew measured it, then cast it. It was 24‚Äù long and 11‚Äù wide. A real monster! 

Realizing that this farmer had a real problem on his hands, and possibly a very dangerous situation, he told the farmer that he knew someone who could help him. He explained to the farmer that while he is a Bigfoot researcher he is not really equipped to engage them. But he knew someone who could come out and remove the  animal if he wanted. The farmer eagerly said he wanted it gone and that he would be glad to pay for the service. ‚ÄúWell then, let me see about getting ahold of him and getting him out here‚Äù, the nephew said to the farmer. 

As you probably have figured out by now, the nephew is my associate, good old Big Cock from Table Rock (‚ÄúBC‚Äù). He is a paranormal investigator. Upon assessing the farmer‚Äôs precarious situation, BC contacted me, The General. 

When the email notification ‚Äúbinged‚Äù on my iPhone I was right in the middle of eating out the ass of a hot little MILF I picked up earlier in the evening at the bar in an Applebee‚Äôs. I ignored the email. This chick was super hot! She is really petite, just like I like them, standing maybe 5‚Äô5‚Äù, size 4, and 105lbs soaking wet. Oh, and a very legit c-cup. She was a brunette with a little bob haircut. Perfect! She was probably what I would rate a 7 due to her face not being perfect. But that‚Äôs fine with me. It‚Äôs not like I am looking to marry the bitch, ya know what I mean? 

The bummer in the deal, though, is that this chick was at the bar with her fat friend, Bernice. She was a real tank, and sloppy as shit. If I was going to get into my chick‚Äôs pants I had to get old Bernice layed. Thinking on my feet I called in a favor from a buddy of mine, old ‚ÄúThick Meat Pete‚Äù.  Old Pete got caught bootlegging a truck load of shine a while back. I managed to pull some strings and get the charges dropped. See, I just happened to be in possession of some Polaroids of the Sheriff modeling some lingerie. When the Sheriff learned about this he got so upset he forgot all about that little bootlegging matter involving Pete! 

So I called up old Pete. After some pleasantries I told Pete I needed a favor. He asked what I needed. I said, ‚ÄúI need you to fuck a fat skank so I can wet my dick in a top-shelf fuck-puppet.‚Äù Old Pete hem-hawed around, such as not being too interested in fucking a pig. I said, ‚ÄúRemember, Pete. You fucking owe me. If not for me you would be rotting away in the county jail right now.‚Äù Pete finally agreed. 

Me and the girls went back to my place. Pete finally showed up, late. I made a mental note to smack the shit out of him tomorrow for this. Anyway, me and the brunette went back to my bedroom and started fucking. I left Pete to entertain the pig out in the living room on the couch. 

We had been at it for a good long while when the email notification sounded on my phone. I had already destroyed that MILF‚Äôs pussy, so I started on her wazoo next. Shortly thereafter there was a knock on my bedroom door. ‚ÄúFuck off!‚Äù, I said. But it continued. Then I thought that maybe Pete needed a rubber or something. ‚ÄúWhatever‚Äù, I thought, ‚Äúwhatever keeps him and that fat bitch outa my hair.‚Äù

I told tits ‚ÄúHold on a minute, honey. I will be right back.‚Äù I cracked the door open to find Pete standing there. ‚ÄúGeneral!! Come here!!‚Äù, he said. I told Pete to fuck off, but he kept insisting that I come out there. I start getting pissed. However, Pete looked shaken. Reluctantly, I stepped out of my bedroom to see what was going on, closing the door behind me. 

Once in my living room I smacked the piss out of old Pete. ‚ÄúOUCH!!! Why‚Äôd you do that, General?!?‚Äù, asked Pete. I said ‚ÄúBecause you are a shit-sorry wingman, Pete! You are supposed to be keeping that fat fuck busy so I can fuck her friend!! Now what the hell is so important that you have to fuck up my shit?!?‚Äù 

Pete turned and pointed to Bernice lying there on the floor. She was all naked and covered in folds of flesh. ‚ÄúOh, that is just fucking DISGUSTING!‚Äù, I said. Then Pete layed the bad news on me. ‚ÄúGeneral, that bitch is DEAD!‚Äù, said Pete. 

I looked at Pete in his eyes. He was serious. Then I looked over at the fat bitch. ‚ÄúDisgusting‚Äù, I said. Then I turned back to Pete and smacked the shit  out of him again. ‚ÄúOwwww!!l, said Pete. I said ‚ÄúPete, you are a shit sorry wing man, you know that?‚Äù Then I asked him how she ended up dead. 

Pete went on to tell me that the two of them started making out, then one thing led to another, and pretty soon they were fucking. ‚ÄúOhhh ‚Ä¶ That is disgusting!‚Äù, I interjected. Then at some point Pete was holding the fat bitch up off the ground while he was fucking her. But he lost his grip and she fell backward on the fireplace, cracking her head wide open on the bricks. I asked Pete how in the world he could have dropped her. He said, ‚ÄúWell, she‚Äôs really heavy, General.‚Äù 

I moved in closer to inspect the fat bitch. I told Pete he could have at least covered her fat ass up before getting me out there. ‚ÄúFucking disgusting‚Äù, I said again. After failing to locate a pulse I confirmed that she had, in fact, expired. Then I looked around her head and found blood. Then I lifted her head off the bricks. ‚ÄúYep, there it is‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù, asked Pete. I said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs her fucking brains. They‚Äôre everywhere.‚Äù 

Well, that really shook up old Pete. He started heaving and puked right on the floor! ‚ÄúYou dumb sumbitch!! Not on my floor!!‚Äù, I said. I smacked the unholy shit out of Pete and told him to get some wet rags and clean up his puke. ‚ÄúPick up these fucking brains too, you incompetent fuck!‚Äù, I said. 

From in my bedroom I heard the brunette call out, ‚ÄúHey General! Am I going to have to come out there and get you?‚Äù. I said ‚ÄúNo, I will be right back!‚Äù, I called back. 

Pete was already on his hands and knees cleaning his puke off my living room floor. Clearly, he was falling to pieces. Tears were streaming down his eyes as he scrubbed up the sick. ‚ÄúWhat are we going to do, General?!? I am on probation!‚Äù, said Pete. I told Pete to shut up and clean all that shit up, including cleaning the brain and blood. I told Pete we would figure something out after I was done. ‚ÄúDone doing what?‚Äù, asked Pete. I said, ‚ÄúDone fucking that bitch in my bed, dumbass!‚Äù Then ‚ÄòSMACK!!‚Äô, I smacked the shit out of Pete again. 

I returned to the bedroom and resumed defiling that little brunette. ‚ÄúIs everything ok, General?‚Äù, she asked. I said ‚ÄúEverything is beautiful!‚Äù, I replied. We continue to suck and fuck for 2 more hours. She dozed off exhausted around 5:00 am. Once I was sure she was asleep I decided to go check on Pete. I slowly rolled off the bed so as not to disturb ‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ well shit, I don‚Äôt even know her  name. The brunette bitch! 

I quietly closed the bedroom door behind me. I saw old Pete on the couch. He was sitting up, but had obviously dozed off, as his head was hanging way back. I looked first at where he puked all over my rug. It looked spotless. I bent down to look closer. It WAS spotless. ‚ÄúGoddamn, Pete! Good job!‚Äù, I said quietly. Then I glanced over at the fireplace. The dead bitch was gone. I walked over there half expecting to see the brick stained with blood and brains. But the bricks were completely clean!! Old Pete has done exactly as he was told! 

I decided to wake up old Pete. I shook him and said ‚ÄúPete! Pete!! Wake up you dumb fuck!!!‚Äù, and shook him some more. The bastard just sat there lifeless. Then a thought hit me: Maybe old Pete started feeling guilty about killing that fat bitch and killed himself. ‚ÄúShit!!‚Äù, I said to myself as I turned and walked to the window to look through as I pondered my situation. This is all I needed right now. I already had one homicide to deal with. Now Pete was going to lay it all on me to deal with on my own AND throw a second death on top of it?!?! That fucking son of a whore!!

I turned violently and started toward the couch where Pete sat, intending to rip what‚Äôs left of him to shreds out of pure, blinding rage. But I was immediately stopped in my tracks. ‚ÄúPETE!!‚Äù, I exclaimed. Unknown to me, old Pete had got up from the couch and was now standing between me and it. ‚ÄúHoly fuck!!! I thought you were dead!‚Äù, I said. Old Pete replied, ‚ÄúAww, nah. I‚Äôm just a heavy sleeper, General.‚Äù I called him a ‚Äústupid fucker‚Äù in response. 

Anyway, I queried Pete for an update on the post-mortem cleanup operation. It seems that Pete had wrapped up the fat bitch in a rug and stuck her in the bed of his pickup truck. He then scrubbed everything down with Windex window cleaner, followed by stuffing all the paper towels and other remnants in a garbage bag, sealed the same, then placed said bags in my kitchen. Pete then realized his mistake, discovering that Windex is window cleaner. He subsequently located a bottle of bleach then repeated the foregoing. 

‚ÄúGood job, Pete‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù, asked Pete. I told him that he needed to start a fire in the fireplace, and that it needed to be a great big roaring fire. Then he needed to burn the contents of those garbage bags and the bags themselves. ‚ÄúNo DNA‚Äù, I told Pete. He nodded in agreement. I told Pete to give me his truck keys because I was going to get rid of the shit he loaded in his truck bed. Old Pete obliged. I said ‚ÄúOk, Pete, I am going to take care of what‚Äôs in your truck while you take care of business here. Got it?‚Äù Pete nodded. Then I said, ‚ÄúRemember: NO DNA!‚Äù. 

So I left in Pete‚Äôs truck and headed down to the river. I will not get into all the particulars of what transpired after I left the house. Suffice it to say that before I left the house I grabbed my chain saw, some wire, and some concrete blocks. I also grabbed some pliers so I could do some dental work while I was out. I traveled to the river, a couple of creeks, and a remote tract of woods. All in all my trip took about 3 hours. By the time I got done the sun was up. 

On the way home I went through the drive-thru window at a Dunkin Donuts to buy Pete and I some coffee and a couple of biscuits. When I pulled up to the window I was greeted by a pretty face and a wide grin. ‚ÄúGENERAL!! I thought that was you!!! Hello, baby!! How you been?!?‚Äù

I had no fucking idea who this bitch was. But she seemed to dig me and, more importantly, she had a rocking set of tits. So I played along. ‚ÄúHey there, sweetie! You is looking GOOD girl!! You been working out??‚Äù, I said. I sat there for a few minutes talking to this bitch without any idea who she is. Finally, I heard car horns blasting from behind me. This royally pissed me off. I hung my head out the window and shouted at the driver immediately behind me that if he blows his horn again then I was going to come back there and murder him on the spot. 

The fact is, talking to the bitch here in the drive-thru window was getting me aroused. More accurately, looking at her hard nipples being pushed forward, thrust at me, through her Dunkin Donut uniform shirt by those big old double D titties ‚Ä¶ it was driving me crazy. It also gave me a huge, throbbing shanker. I had definitely allowed myself to become distracted. 

The bitch then said, with a sad look on her face, that I had better pull on through. ‚ÄúMy Iranian bosses are really strict. They are ball busters, in fact. I fucking hate them‚Äù, she said. Then I thought to myself for a moment. Iranians. I fucking hate Iranians. Instinctively I reached for the .357 mag revolver on my hip. I had it half out of its holster before I caught myself. I then repeated the mantra  taught to me by the court-appointed anger management therapist: ‚ÄúDe-escalation‚Äù.

I turned to the bitch in the window with a grin on my face and said ‚ÄúFuck those Iranian pricks! Hop on in here with The General and we‚Äôll have us a good old time!‚Äù The bitch let out a ‚ÄúYee Haw!‚Äù and jumped through the window and into my lap. ‚ÄúFuck yeah!‚Äù I said, then hit the gas. I headed back to my place with the intent to fuck this cute bitch silly. 

We were only halfway to my house when the bitch had my cock out and started blowing me. ‚ÄúOh General, I have dreamed of that big hard cock of yours for months!‚Äù, she said as she slurped and gagged on my rod. I still had no idea who this bitch is. But whatever. I let her suck on my pole as I drove home. 

I finished off just as I pulled into my driveway. I sat there for a moment or two, then we got out and went inside. I had my hands all over her ass as we walked inside. I was already throbbing again! Then the sound hit me.  It was loud snoring, from inside the house!! 

I immediately went on full alert. I told the bitch to take a time out as I pulled out my magnum. Someone was inside my house! Determined, I moved purposefully toward the sound. It was leading me into my living room. At the doorway I slowly slid my head inside and looked, with my pistol at the ready. There I found the source of the snoring. There was a man sleeping on my couch. 

It was Pete!! Holy shit, I forgot about that sumbitch!! Suddenly, the reality of the preceding night set in and I remembered what Pete and I had been doing before I went to Dunkin Donuts and got distracted by the cute bitch. 

Right then the cute bitch asked who that was sleeping on my couch. ‚ÄúShut up‚Äù, I said. I knew I had to play this scene just right given what had gone down here last night if I was going to get this bitch  to willingly give up her cooch to me. I turned to her and asked her to go into the bedroom and get herself ready for me. She obliged. Then I turned my attention to Pete. 

‚ÄúWHAP!!!‚Äù, I smacked the shit out of Pete upside his head. He jumped up and whined ‚ÄúOuch!! Why‚Äôd you go and do that, General?‚Äù. I told him to shut up. I then asked if he had taken care of everything like I told him to. Pete nodded, then said ‚ÄúYessir! I took care of everything, even the girl.‚Äù 

‚ÄúTHE GIRL?!?‚Äù Holy shit!! I forgot about the Applebee‚Äôs bitch in my bed!! And I had just sent the Dunkin Donuts bitch back there!! Oh shit!! This is going to be awkward!  I immediately started concocting what to say so I could turn this into a rocking 3-way. My dick hardened at the thought of this! What a fortunate turn of events, I thought!!

Then Pete interrupted my train of thought, saying ‚ÄúGeneral, I took care of everything like you said. Even the girl‚Ä¶‚Äù. I told Pete to shut the fuck up because I was preoccupied with what was about to go down in my bedroom. After 5 minutes of hearing nothing from my bedroom I figured that the 2 bitches had met and that everything was going to be cool. I told Pete to chill out for a bit while I went to work. I then went into my bedroom, cock first! 

I went in and got into bed with the Dunkin Donuts bitch. The other bitch was not in bed. I assumed she was in the bathroom. The donut bitch and I started making out. She started stroking my old tallywacker as I was finger fucking her cooch. It was getting all hot and steamy in there. I started wondering where the Applebee‚Äôs bitch was. Was she in the bathroom taking a shit? Fuck!! What a fucking slob, I thought. 

Now, I had already blown 4-5 loads on the Applebee‚Äôs bitch the prior night. I had just blasted a load in the donut bitch‚Äôs mouth in my driveway. And here I am about to pop again. I know that I don‚Äôt have much left in me before I am going to have to take a nap, and I want a 3-way. So I put a stop to the foreplay with the donut bitch so I could go fetch the other bitch. She did not want to let me go, so I told her I had to go take a shit. 

I got up and walked over to the bathroom door. My massive wang was leading the way. I lightly knocked on the door. No answer. I turned and looked at the donut bitch. She was just mindlessly looking at her fingernails. I tried the doorknob to the bathroom. It opened. It was dark inside. ‚ÄúHello‚Äù I quietly spoke. Nothing. So I walked in and hit the light. It was empty! Nobody was in the bathroom! 

I was like ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?!?  Where is the Applebee‚Äôs bitch?!?‚Äù Then it came back to me: Pete tried to tell me something about the Applebee‚Äôs bitch but I was not listening to him. The gushing sound in my ears of the blood rushing out of my brain and into my cock was deafening in the moment. ‚ÄúI need to talk to Pete‚Äù, I said to myself. 

I walked out of the bathroom. But before going out to talk to old Pete, I went back to bed and dumped a large protein shake down the donut bitch‚Äôs throat. ‚ÄúBe back in a minute, babe!‚Äù, I told her as I walked out the door to the living room, being sure to shut it behind me. 

I walked over to Pete sitting on the couch. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the Applebee‚Äôs bitch?‚Äù, I asked. No answer. I noticed that Pete‚Äôs gaze was to south of the border. ‚ÄúHey! Pete! Stop looking at my pecker!‚Äù, I commanded. Pete looked up and said ‚ÄúDude! Put on some clothes!! You just walked out here bare-assed naked and swinging your huge schlong around!‚Äù I had to admit that Pete had a point, and that he was correct that I had committed a social faux pas. So I went back to my bedroom and threw on some pants and a tee shirt, told the donut bitch I would be right back, then went back to the living room. 

Again standing in front of Pete I asked ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the Applebee‚Äôs bitch?‚Äù Pete simply said ‚ÄúI took care of it. I replied, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you mean you took care of it?‚Äù Pete said ‚ÄúI got rid of the DNA. All of it.‚Äù 

I asked Pete if he had killed the Applebee‚Äôs bitch. Pete simply said ‚ÄúNo witnesses. No DNA.‚Äù He said it so calmly and coolly it was chilling. See, old Pete is a peculiar person. He acts dumber than a tree stump most of the time. But the fact is that he is not dumb at all. He is just wired differently from most of us. I pondered on this for a moment. Then I looked at old Pete and said ‚ÄúGood job, Pete‚Äù, to which he nodded. 

I plopped down on the couch beside Pete. We sat there looking forward for a couple minutes. Then I said to Pete, ‚ÄúI guess we got some more DNA to clean up in the bedroom‚Äù. Pete looked at me and asked whether I was sure I was done with it. I said ‚ÄúHell, I have been nutting up all night. I am dry and exhausted. So yeah, I‚Äôm done.‚Äù Then I looked over at old Pete and said ‚ÄúYou can go hit it if you want. I have only dumped loads down her throat. Her cooter is clean.‚Äù Old Pete got a big old grin on his face. I told Pete to go on and have fun, I was going to take a nap on the couch because I was fucking exhausted. 

Well, I woke up around 5:00 pm to the sound of Pete coming through my front door. I said ‚ÄúDamn, Pete, you should not have let me sleep so damn long‚Äù. Pete made a dismissive gesture with his right hand. He told me that he had already gotten rid of all the DNA and cleaned my house. ‚ÄúShit, I would have helped you!‚Äù, I said. Pete said it was not a problem. ‚ÄúYou needed the sleep, bro.‚Äù, Pete said. 

Pete and I then said our goodbyes. He went on his way and I made some coffee. I eventually sat down in my chair in my den with my coffee, picked up my iPhone, and checked my emails. I saw the email from BC about the Bigfoot down in Macon County. Believing that this presented me with both a money-making opportunity and a chance to go shoot critters (both things I love to do), I kind of shrugged to myself and then dialed BC‚Äôs cell number. 

BC picked up on the third ring. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù, it was BC‚Äôs voice on the line. I said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs The General. I received your email‚Äù. The voice on the other end of the line said ‚ÄúHey General! Big Cock here!! Thanks for calling me back!!  I got a job for you!‚Äù 

I heard what sounded like a bitch voice in the background. I asked BC if he was in the middle of something. BC said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just fucking this bitch. I can talk.‚Äù BC then proceeded to tell me the back story on the Macon County sasquatch. The heavy breathing and moaning on the other end of the line told me that BC continued to fuck his bitch as he told me the story.

Currently, I own a ECM Synchronika with flow control and the accompanying ECM 64 Manuale grinder. My main question here is if it's worth it to upgrade to SSP burrs with my current grinder or sell the ECM and reinvest in a different 64 mm platform, or go with conical burrs. 

Currently, the Manuale produces mostly bland shots that come out bitter and needs to run at at the point of the burrs almost touching to pull a decent shot. It also has high (5g) retention. This is inspite cleaning out the grinder and dialing in many different bean roasts and varieties.

I've seen both the Niche and the DF64 touted as game changers. We have a Niche at my workplace and it has produced some amazing shots and seems to be less sensitive to adjustment. 

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for in a grinder:

* **Consistent grind size** for espresso and filter coffee
* **Low retention** (don‚Äôt want a bunch of stale grounds left behind after grinding)
* Easy to **maintain** and **clean**
* Budget-wise, I‚Äôm aiming for something in the $400‚Äì$600 range if not going for a burr upgrade

100g sourdough starter 
100g warm orange juice
100g warm water
150g warm sweet cream coffee creamer (I used the ALDI brand)
Zest of one orange
4g dry active yeast
Splash of vanilla extract
1 stick unsalted butter
500g AP flour
8g Himalayan salt

For the glaze:
1/3 cup orange juice
1/3 sugar

In a bowl mix together warm creamer and orange juice.
Add in dry yeast and let sit until bubbly. Add in softened butter, starter and zest and mix until well incorporated. Add in water, vanilla extract, flour and salt. Min until mostly incorporated and then kneed until dough is no longer sticky. (This took me roughly 6 minutes by hand) Cover and set aside in warm area to double in size.
Once doubled, remove from bowl and split dough in half. Shape into two balls and place on parchment lined cookie sheet. Loosely over with plastic wrap and leave to double in size again. Once doubled in size preheat oven to 350¬∞, remove plastic and bake for roughly 40 minutes or until about 210¬∞ internally and golden brown on top. 
Once bread is out of the oven and cooling, over the stove add orange juice and sugar to a sauce pan and stir frequently over medium-high heat. Bring sugar to a boil and continue to stir frequently while cooking for two minutes. Remove sugar mixture from heat and brush over bread to form a crust.

I mean everybody can do it. But the actual work, spending hours alone researching, outlining, writing, more research, rewriting, editing...can take a toll. Add to that the many hours of submitting and the countless rejections, it takes a lot to survive this line of work, even if you are full of creative energy and passion. It's mental work, it's emotional work, it's psychological work. Even physical work, in the sense that sitting for so many hours can easily mess up your posture and give you pain.

This is not news to anybody who has been doing this but more of a reminder to take time off, do self-soothing activities like having a spa day, go hiking, call a friend or better yet have a cup of coffee and talk about anything but writing.

This is especially important if you have a history of mental health issues. If you lack motivation, maybe it's not writer's block and it's your body and mind telling you they had it up to here with this line of work. And need a break.

And one more suggestion is have something else in life that you do well and get immediate positive results. Don't let some random reader or magazine publisher determine your worth. Have a life outside of writing.

Again, many of you already do that, cause you're forced to make a living, but I'm saying go beyond surviving and try to thrive, to find things you do well and do them regularly so you feel good about yourself. And in control of your life.

1 - My name is Sean.

B - I‚Äôm 40 years old üéâ

3 - I‚Äôm Scottish! I was born in a small town in Scotland. I've travelled a lot and was lucky enough to have a fun job when I was younger that let me see the world.

4 - I‚Äôm currently working as an engineering technician. I accidentally fell into this job and I really can‚Äôt complain too much. I spend most of the week working from home, drinking tea/coffee and lurking in the background of Zoom meetings while trying to figure out how to do something a little bit more exciting for work. I feel like I need to be doing something more creative with my time on this planet.

E - It‚Äôs not unusual to find me lost in a Spotify hole with my headphones on, hunting for new music and creating playlists. If you have any music suggestions, I'd love to hear them. In turn, if you are looking for a suggestion, i'm here to help.

F - I love to draw/sketch/doodle and I‚Äôll ALWAYS be up for drawing something for the people I chat with. I thrive when someone gives me an idea and its also a great way to see what goes on in someone‚Äôs head üòä

7 - I like to go to the gym. I've seen a few people post recently that they were looking for someone to effectively be their gym friend. I quite like this idea and would happily do that. Routine advice, encouragement and just someone to keep each other company in-between sets.

8 - I also like to sink some time into games. I have a backlog that I‚Äôm never ever going to get through. I've just started Stardew Valley again so that's me doomed.

Why am I posting on Reddit? I'm here for some fun casual conversation. I miss the social aspect of being at shows and meeting new people so making friends and having conversations on here scratches that itch.

If you think you‚Äôd like to chat with me and see how things go, don‚Äôt be scared to send me a dm!

B - I‚Äôm 40 years old üéâ

3 - I‚Äôm Scottish! I was born in a small town in Scotland. I've travelled a lot and was lucky enough to have a fun job when I was younger that let me see the world.

4 - I‚Äôm currently working as an engineering technician. I accidentally fell into this job and I really can‚Äôt complain too much. I spend most of the week working from home, drinking tea/coffee and lurking in the background of Zoom meetings while trying to figure out how to do something a little bit more exciting for work. I feel like I need to be doing something more creative with my time on this planet.

E - It‚Äôs not unusual to find me lost in a Spotify hole with my headphones on, hunting for new music and creating playlists. If you have any music suggestions, I'd love to hear them. In turn, if you are looking for a suggestion, i'm here to help.

F - I love to draw/sketch/doodle and I‚Äôll ALWAYS be up for drawing something for the people I chat with. I thrive when someone gives me an idea and its also a great way to see what goes on in someone‚Äôs head üòä

7 - I like to go to the gym. I've seen a few people post recently that they were looking for someone to effectively be their gym friend. I quite like this idea and would happily do that. Routine advice, encouragement and just someone to keep each other company in-between sets.

8 - I also like to sink some time into games. I have a backlog that I‚Äôm never ever going to get through. I've just started Stardew Valley again so that's me doomed.

Why am I posting on Reddit? I'm here for some fun casual conversation. I miss the social aspect of being at shows and meeting new people so making friends and having conversations on here scratches that itch.

If you think you‚Äôd like to chat with me and see how things go, don‚Äôt be scared to send me a dm!

I prefer to chat over on Telegram but we can hang here if we need to üòä

I‚Äôm wondering if anybody knows where/how I can get rid of an old queen-sized mattress? Ideally cheap or free.

It‚Äôs over a decade old, so I‚Äôm not sure if it would be worth giving it to someone else haha.

Does anyone have any info?",1,1732582474.0,auckland,5,1.0,False
